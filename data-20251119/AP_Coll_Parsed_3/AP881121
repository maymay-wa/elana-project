the night before joel steinbergs adoptive 
6yearold daughter was removed unconscious from their apartment 
his livein companion said she heard noises in a bedroom like joel 
throwing lisa sources said monday 
hedda nussbaum told a psychiatrist at columbia presbyterian 
medical center on nov 20 that steinberg who is accused of beating 
lisa steinberg to death then handed the child to her saying 
this is your child what have you done this has gone far 
enough wcbstv said monday quoting from a copy of the 
unidentified psychiatrists report 
the associated press confirmed the contents of the report through 
sources close to the case 
nussbaum told the psychiatrist that steinberg was angry that 
night because lisa refused to drink water after he had given her and 
nussbaum hot pepper she said he gave them the hot pepper to get 
them to drink more water 
she later heard noises from the bedroom that sounded like joel 
throwing lisa the report said 
afterward steinberg gave the child to nussbaum who placed her 
on the floor and noticed water and food coming out of her mouth 
the report said that nussbaum thought joel may have poured water 
down lisas mouth and that she was drowning nussbaum said she then 
began pumping the childs chest 
nussbaum told the psychiatrist that steinberg had left the 
apartment shortly afterward and returned about 10 pm at about 6 
am steinberg said shes stopped breathing and told nussbaum 
to call 911 
nussbaum 46 a former editor of childrens books also was 
charged with lisas murder but the charges against her later were 
dropped 
she has spent the last year undergoing physical and psychiatric 
rehabilitation for injuries the prosecution says she suffered at 
steinbergs hands 
at steinbergs trial on monday a photographer testified that he 
used poses and lighting tricks to hide bruises he saw on the 
battered child when he took pictures of her in school two weeks 
before she was found dead 
stuart gross working that day for scholastic books said he 
initially was reluctant to photograph the firstgrader when he 
visited her school on oct 22 1987 because of her numerous bruises 
and her unkempt appearance 
i observed some bruises underneath her left eye by the cheeks 
a bump on the forehead and underneath the chin here a bruise and 
some bruises on her arms gross said the hair was very unkempt 
uneven and her clothes were very rumpled dirty he said 
gross said he eventually took several black and white pictures of 
lisa he said he was drawn to her when she began directing two other 
children on posing the way he wanted them she seemed older more 
mature he said 
i put her on the right side and i flooded my light into her and 
i had her turn her head this way and down so you wouldnt see it 
the last thing my client wants to see is bruises gross said 
he said the rumpled and dirty quality of lisas clothing also was 
eliminated in the way i photographed them 
steinberg 47 is charged with murder for allegedly beating lisa 
to death the disbarred lawyer denies that he hit the child he says 
she fell unconscious after choking on food she had vomited 
lisa was taken unconscious from steinbergs greenwich village 
apartment early on nov 2 1987 and died three days later at a 
hospital 
prosecutors are trying to show by gross photographs and 
testimony that lisa was an abused child in the weeks before her 
death they hope to eliminate any reasonable inference except that 
the abuse was inflicted by steinberg who illegally adopted the girl

president roh taewoo was quoted as 
saying monday that he wants to resolve politically the controversy 
raging over his predecessor chun doohwan an indication he may 
pardon chun 
chun is preparing to apologize for corruption and other misdeeds 
before moving into rural exile 
roh said his government hopes to resolve the controversy over 
chun by the end of this year the former president is being forced 
out of the capital seoul by militant students who rioted and tried 
to break into his home demanding that he be arrested and punished 
for alleged corruption and other abuses during seven years of 
authoritarian rule 
roh was quoted as saying in an interview with the national daily 
shinmun a progovernment newspaper published in seoul 
in handling past wrongdoings a clear distinction must be made 
between those wrongdoings to be dealt with judicially and those to 
be dealt with politically any wrongdoings by chun as chief 
executive of the country should be dealt with politically and there 
should not be political reprisal against the former chief executive 
 
i will take actions under the principle that any wrongdoings by 
a chief executive should be dealt with politically and that any 
political reprisal would only hurt democratic development 
he made the remarks as the 56yearold chun reportedly was 
preparing to make a nationally televised apology wednesday 
newspapers said chun also is to turn over most of his wealth to 
the government and accept rural exile a traditional way of 
repentance for a disgraced korean 
chun originally planned to leave seoul on tuesday but was 
delayed because of difficulty finding him a safe rural home news 
reports said 
the former president who stepped down in february denies 
personal wrongdoing however about a dozen of his relatives and 
associates were convicted or charged with corruption involving 
millions of dollars in public funds 
chun needs a refuge from attack some reports said he would go to 
a mountainside buddhist temple near an army unit in the north 
others said he might move to central south korea he reportedly is 
unwelcome in his southern hometown 
national assembly hearings monday on abuses under the chun 
government focused on attempts to stifle press freedom more than 
700 journalists were fired under government pressure and many 
newspapers and broadcast operations were merged and placed under 
state control by chuns administration 
in recent weeks chun has been a virtual prisoner in his 
luxurious seoul home guarded by hundreds of riot police to prevent 
attacks by dissidents 
rohs government has been accused of trying to protect chun and 
is trying to defuse public anger without being implicated in the 
furor 
chun a former army general took power with military backing in 
1980 he was succeeded by roh another former general and close 
associate after presidential elections last december

that experts are having trouble explaining how his heliumfilled 
balloon flew 2500 miles from michigan to san diego 
he just thinks its neat said his mother liz 
marcs 11inch yellow balloon was one of 250 launched oct 23 to 
commemorate a local churchs anniversary each balloon was tied with 
a string that carried a card asking the finder to return it to the 
church 
the church received 10 to 15 responses mostly from within 20 
miles 
marcs balloon wound up deflated in the swimming pool of a san 
diego sheriffs deputy oct 30

they call it the castle a 
massive stone building with eight wings radiating from a central 
sixstory rotunda 
the wings hold eight tiers of cells stacked one upon the other 
and in each 8by10foot cell an inmate is allowed a cot a table 
and a chair 
the us disciplinary barracks in fort leavenworth is the biggest 
military prison in the nation it is a grim home for about 1450 
inmates sent here from bases all over the world wherever american 
military men and women are stationed 
fortytwo officers including one lieutenant colonel and 21 
women are serving time here among them are drug dealers armed 
robbers rapists murderers and spies more than 80 are serving life 
terms three inmates are on death row 
and there is strict military discipline 
our rules are so strict that if a guy turns left and he knows 
hes not supposed to turn left hes in trouble said lt col 
gerald m gasko prison chief of staff 
you earn what you get here added the prison commandant col 
larry berrong a former army airborne ranger and vietnam veteran 
there arent any free lunches 
military officials say the goal of the prison is not just 
confinement but correction 
unfortunately in the united states today we do a lot of 
confining and not much correction gasko said we attempt to 
give them tools so when they leave here they can be productive 
citizens 
when inmates leave these walls they return to civilian life not 
to the military 
next to discipline training is the top priority at the fort 
leavenworth prison which has more than 20 vocational programs 
including automotive repairs printing carpentry upholstery and 
hotel and restaurant management 
inmates whom officials would not allow to be interviewed even 
repair cars and furniture of military families living at fort 
leavenworth 
officials claim the disciplinary barracks has the oldest shoe 
repair business west of the mississippi river started in 1877 to 
make boots for cavalrymen 
now it repairs everything from prescription orthopedic shoes to 
cleated golf shoes gasko said 
the prison also has one of the largest silkscreening businesses 
in the nation providing all the decals for us air force planes 
congress authorized the prisons construction in 1874 an old 
quartermaster depot that had supplied military posts in the indian 
territory housed the first prisoners the castle was completed in 
1915 by inmate labor 
inmate labor is still used for maintenance but the prisoners 
also work with their minds most have high school diplomas and 
those who dont go straight into the classroom when they arrive 
gasko said 
they can earn associate and bachelors degrees through 
correspondence and a few are working on masters degrees but gasko 
said they do that at their own expense 
the prison takes enlisted men from all branches of the service 
except the us navy it takes all convicted officers regardless of 
the length of the sentence 
gasko said the shortest sentence for an officer he recalls is 
seven days i think they wanted him to see the inside of a 
prison he said 
one inmate is going into his 17th year he added 
some famous inmates have seen the inside of its walls from lt 
william calley who was convicted of murdering vietnamese civilians 
at my lai to clayton lonetree the us marine who was convicted of 
espionage while an embassy guard in moscow 
three inmates are awaiting death sentence although the army has 
not executed anyone since 1961 and no execution dates have been set 
they are 
ronald gray 22 of liberty city fla who was sentenced last 
april in connection with the death of two women he was stationed at 
fort bragg nc 
james murphy 24 of clinton nc who was convicted last year 
of murdering his wife his 6yearold stepson and his 2yearold 
son while stationed in nanau germany with the army 
ronnie curtis 22 a marine from wichita kan who was 
convicted in august 1987 of murdering his platoon commander and 
platoon commanders wife at camp lejeune 
although most inmates are firsttime offenders the average 
sentence is about 10 years about twothirds are serving time for 
such crimes as assault rape murder or kidnapping 17 percent are 
imprisoned for narcotics violations and 11 percent were sentenced 
for theft no inmate is serving time for just a military offense 
such as being absent without leave 
some prisoners work outside the walls and in nearby leavenworth 
on workrelease programs about 20 inmates work on the 2600acre 
prison farm which raises hogs and cattle and grows row crops and 
vegetables 
outside the castle walls inmates who are installation 
parolees stay in an unsecure barracks they have proved 
themeselves reliable while doing their time and have earned a few 
extra privleges 
the only thing that keeps them out there is moral restraint 
gasko said but the rules are extremely tough and we dont 
tolerate any violations

one of the key factors of the postsoviet era in

cities and in this dispatch describes the situation now with the

evening campfires in the nomads 
camelhide tents dance to a nightly staccato of gunfire from warring 
rebels and communist government soldiers on the desert plain outside 
this ancient provincial capital 
turbaned men oblivious to the shots face southwest toward the 
moslem holy city of mecca to begin their evening prayer women in 
voluminous layers of colored cloth move about nearby 
the primitive nomad tribes have for centuries encamped near 
kandahars satellite village of argandab now soviet jets scream 
overhead 
afghanistans war goes on around them and sometimes engulfs them 
less than a mile from the nomads camp moslem rebels blast away 
at government military posts with recoilless rifles 
rocketpropelled grenade launchers and light and heavy machine guns 
the armys artillery is an even match but government troops have 
an advantage in air power from the soviet union newly introduced 
mig27 groundattack fighters and backfire bombers have blasted 
civilian and guerrilla targets since the beginning of november 
the question is how long can the government hold kandahar a key 
city once the soviets withdraw from afghanistan they are committed 
to do so by february 
in argandab where civilians far outnumber rebels jets swept one 
recent day over the main bazaar levelling a portion of it killing 
nine people and wounding 80 others 
a squat man with a gray beard said when i wake up in the 
morning until i go to sleep im not sure about my life that i will 
be alive five minutes from now because of the war 
the old man wrapped in a blanket said he lived in kandahar 
once the capital of all afghanistan 
through the fine dust that hangs over the city the pale blue 
dome of the kalqi sharif mosque can be seen from a distance the 
mosque which embodies the islamic tenets propelling the rebel 
mujahedeen in their fight sits opposite the governors home a 
stronghold of the sovietbacked government 
the western entrance to the city is deserted but for the army and 
militia tanks and trucks civilians are not seen except at the 
bazaar at shaheedan chowk a pillared monument honoring afghans 
killed fighting the british more than a century ago 
kandahar known as the city of kings is the birthplace of 
generations of afghan royalty the ornate tomb of ahmad shah 
durrani the grandfather of afghanistans exiled king zahir shah is 
a vernerated site of monarchists who are in the majority around 
kandahar both among the mujahedeen and civilians 
the rubble of blasted buildings chokes the streets forcing 
motorized rickshaws and horse drawn tonga carriages to steer an 
obstacle course through the bazaar 
gul lalai a commander of the rebel national islamic front of 
afghanistan said the bulk of the damage near herat gate on the 
western edge of kandahar occurred when fighter jets aiming at 
guerrilla positions in a nearby suburb missed their mark 
evidence that the guerrillas have operated extensively in the 
city for years is the heavy tankfire damage to the mud homes and 
shops 
about 50000 people remain in kandahar compared to a prewar 
population of about 200000 making it second only in size to kabul 
afghanistans capital 
old men women and children crowd daily into the bazaar before it 
closes at 2 pm 
the free access of women and children is used by mujahedeen who 
employ youngsters to bring supplies to rebel bases from the city 
one of the young recruits gul mohammad said he lost his mother 
two younger sisters and a brother when a tank round hit his home in 
kandahar two years ago he was 9 years old at the time 
police once stopped him and a friend carrying turbans sandals 
and important letters to rebels he said when they captured 
me they beat me up even they broke my head 
mohammad said he spent almost a year in kandahar prison 
everyday for questioning they brought us to a room full of 
water and made us lie down and they beat us he said 
im not afraid of anything he boasted but mujahedeen said 
his forays into the city were finished

young cbs correspondent dan rather was standing 
just over a ridge from dallas dealey plaza holding a yellow sack 
waiting for a film drop from the cameraman in president kennedys 
motorcade 
i saw what i thought was the presidents limousine and it 
seemed to make a wrong turn rather recalled recently it all 
went by in a blur 
i knew something was wrong you know when you know something 
but you dont know why you know it i went back over that ridge and 
saw an incredible scene some people were on the ground some people 
were trying to cover children it was a scene of great confusion 
rather looked for a telephone but couldnt immediately find one 
he sprinted to krld the cbs affiliate a few blocks away 
cbs anchor walter cronkite was in new york working in the 
newsroom 
i happened to be standing at the printer when the up bulletin 
came across that shots had rung out in dealey plaza he said as 
soon as we got that first report we ordered up lines and got into 
the announce booth and started interrupting with voiceover 
bulletins on the ongoing program and then we got the camera up 
there i think in about 10 minutes 
while cronkite read wire reports on the air rather was at krld 
trying to confirm rumors that kennedy was dead the parkland 
memorial hospital switchboard told him kennedy was dead krlds 
eddie barker had the head of the hospital saying he was dead rather 
finally got a surgeon and a priest who were in the emergency room to 
confirm that kennedy was dead rather told new york cronkite went 
with it on the air 
there wasnt any doubt in my mind said rather who had 
beaten the opposition on the biggest story of their lives the 
official announcement wasnt made for another 17 minutes it was a 
very long 17 minutes 
after those 17 minutes cronkite was handed a piece of wire copy 
from dallas texas the flash apparently official he said 
solemnly removing his glasses president kennedy died at 1 pm 
central standard time two oclock eastern standard time some 38 
minutes ago cronkite choked up for a moment on camera 
this one really struck home he recalled this was tearing 
the guts out 
it was when you finally had to say the word officially that 
he was dead that it really impacted in the way it did 
cronkite walked off the air after six hours and just wanted to 
call his wife betsy the phone lines had been tied up all 
afternoon a line came free for a second and he grabbed it only to 
hear a woman ask to speak to someone in charge of the news 
department 
she said id like to complain about having that walter 
cronkite on the air at this time crying his crocodile tears when 
everyone knows he hated john kennedy i said madam what is your 
name she gave me her name and address on park avenue i said you 
are speaking to walter cronkite and you madam are a goddamn 
idiot he hung up 
on sunday the networks were covering the movement of accused 
assassin lee harvey oswald from the dallas city jail to the county 
jail only nbc was on live when jack ruby stepped out of the crowd 
and shot oswald at pointblank range tom pettit was the 
correspondent on the scene 
i clearly saw the shooting which was about six feet from where 
i was he says i had a clear visual field to see somebody fire 
a revolver into oswalds lower abdomen i did not see jack ruby come 
through the crowd i did not see anybody i just saw the gunshot 
what i was seeing was coming out of my mouth it was the only 
time ive really experienced doing eyewitness reporting while youre 
live on the air 
pettit said he has never seen his own coverage of the oswald 
assassination and doesnt want to 
you know its a kind of a historic event in broadcasting the 
first televised murder but for me it was so horrendous a situation 
to be in and so emotional and so charged with fear concern and a 
sense of pending doom that i would not like to relive it 
i remember hearing our coverage when they had the casket at the 
rotunda of the capitol no narration just symphonic music 
television really distinguished itself in that time i think really 
devoted itself to the notion that it was holding the country 
together whether it was in truth or not who am i to say but at 
the time we certainly felt that responsibility 
it was a major moment of course in our history and in our 
television history cronkite said i think we responded as an 
industry well we showed our capabilities technologically and 
substantively as well what we covered how we covered it the 
decorum with which we approached the story 
i think these four days were the beginning of the television 
age certainly the beginning for television journalism rather 
said there was a secondclass citizenry to being a television 
journalist that day not only did we take you there television 
journalists did some real good reporting that day we began to 
feel hey were as good as anybody

a year after cubans from the mariel boatlift 
rioted at two prisons for a chance at freedom thousands are out on 
parole but more are dribbling back into what could be lifetime 
custody 
many of the thousands of cubans held by the immigration and 
naturalization service will be freed more quickly because of changes 
made in the review process as a result of the agreement that ended 
the riots but others will have to await new laws or the whim of the 
cuban government 
critics of the process acknowledge it has increased the number of 
cubans freed but say it has other problems 
were not saying some of the cuban prisoners in there arent 
bad said gary leshaw a legal aid lawyer who has represented the 
detainees were saying were not sure the system is designed to 
sort out the people who do not belong there 
the detainees are a minority among the 125000 cubans who arrived 
during the fivemonth freedom flotilla from the cuban port of 
mariel in 1980 many of those who arrived were criminals or mental 
patients freed from jails and hospitals 
a few were arrested on arrival for crimes committed in cuba 
others were convicted of crimes here and turned over to the ins for 
deportation after finishing their sentences but cuba wouldnt take 
them back so they remained in detention 
since the detainees never were officially admitted to the united 
states they have existed in legal limbo as excludable aliens 
courts ruled that the cubans did not have to released and could be 
excluded without legal protections 
then rioting erupted at federal prisons in oakdale la and 
atlanta after the state departments nov 20 1987 announcement 
that cuba had agreed to take back more than 2500 of the 3800 
mariel refugees locked up nationwide at the time the rioters 
wielding crudely fashioned weapons took 145 hostages and burned 
several buildings one inmate was killed in the 11day uprising in 
atlanta 
the uprisings ended dec 4 1987 after the government agreed to 
a moratorium on deportations and a onetimeonly justice department 
review of each ins decision 
ins spokesman duke austin in washington said the agreement also 
called for speedy reviews of inmates cases which have resulted in 
the parole of about 60 percent of the detainees since the 
uprisings ins increased the number of review panels from four to 20 
the reviews conducted by these panels go beyond anything thats 
required by law or by court order cary copeland a deputy 
associate attorney general said thursday theyre designed to 
give the detainee and his representative every opportunity to tell 
the panels anything they feel appropriate in reaching their 
decisions 
so far about 2500 cubans have been paroled parole has been 
denied to about 1500 others who will continue to get annual ins 
reviews but could spend years even their lives in ins custody even 
through they have finished prison sentences for their crimes 
about 115 are at a federal facility in talladega ala awaiting 
word on whether they will be sent back to cuba the justice 
department announced plans thursday to deport 13 detainees leshaw 
sued to block that claiming the cases are entitled to additional 
review 
an additional 3000 cubans are serving jail sentences and 
eventually will enter ins detention either to be paroled or held 
until cuba takes them back 
unless another agreement is reached with cuba many will not face 
deportation but they will stay in jail indefinitely until an ins 
panel decides they are fit for parole

gambling that peace will prevail despite a 
deadlock in iraqiran peace talks the united states european 
allies are stepping up the postwar dismantling of their military 
forces in the persian gulf 
in recent days the mine sweeper crocus the last of three belgian 
warships deployed to the gulf a year ago sailed for home the last 
five italian warships and one from the netherlands are preparing to 
leave by dec 31 
officials said those moves like an earlier cutback in frances 
regional fleet from 11 to seven ships came because the iraqiran 
ceasefire three months old sunday had brought stability to the 
gulf 
the european actions could add pressure on presidentelect george 
bush to step up an american pullout according to us diplomats and 
military officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
the united states has withdrawn one ship and scaled back convoys 
and other operations but its 25 warships represent about half the 
foreign vessels in the region 
diplomats said defense budget cutters are likely to focus on the 
operation whose monthly cost the pentagon estimated at 15 
million20 million at its peak 
us officials however say the american commitment to 
peacekeeping has led to the bestever relations with the arab gulf 
states and the arab leaders remain nervous about a hasty pullout 
they have made it clear they want us here and they arent 
pushing for us to leave too quickly said a senior diplomat 
us military sources say arab sensitivity to a us pullout 
prompted pentagon officials in september to fudge reports on the 
departure of the uss vincennes listing the cruiser as still on duty 
nearly a week after it left the area 
the pentagon says decisions on reducing the us joint task force 
middle east 15 ships in the gulf and a 10 in the arabian sea 
depend on the iraniraq ceasefire holding 
the pentagon has given no timetable for cutbacks but says the 
gulfbased force eventually would revert to five or six ships the 
level before last years buildup to protect shipping endangered by 
the gulfs tanker war 
the unsponsored truce has held despite warnings from leaders 
in both baghdad and tehran that fighting could resume if no peace 
agreement is achieved 
the general feeling seems to be that the war momentum in the 
gulf is gone and even if fighting started elsewhere it wouldnt 
spread a us diplomat said 
no incidents have been reported since the aug 20 ceasefire 
gulf arab states have appealed to iraq and iran to help in 
clearing mines that still pose a major threat to shipping 
more than 500 commercial vessels were damaged and more than 300 
sailors killed in attacks by both sides during the 8yearold 
conflict 
the war led the reagan administration and six other governments 
to send or reinforce naval units in the gulf which provides nearly 
a fifth of the western worlds petroleum 
congressional foes initially attacked reagans decision as 
risking us involvement in the war the criticism later faded and 
some diplomats expressed amazement that the move scarcely was 
mentioned in the campaign between bush and michael dukakis 
if anybody told me 18 months ago that we could have the biggest 
single concentration of warships since world war ii in the gulf 
with iraq and iran at war and it wouldnt become an election issue 
id have said they were all wet said a senior us diplomat 
since the ceasefire the united states has withdrawn one ship 
and canceled deployment of another reduced air patrols and removed 
a fortified barge from the northern gulf 
instead of escorting commercial vessels in convoys us warships 
now are posted along the 600mile gulf to lend assistance if needed 
us military sources say there is no sign of cutbacks by the 
soviets who have kept seven to nine ships in and near the gulf 
since 1986 
just as president reagans move to expand the us force was 
prompted in part by that growing soviet presence diplomats say any 
major change by moscow could influence the american withdrawal

merrill lynch amp co and the national urban league 
today promised 250 first graders in 10 cities full college 
scholarships or cash incentives if they stay in school through 
graduation 
the merrill lynch foundation the charitable arm of the nations 
largest brokerage firm is underwriting the new 
scholarshipbuilder program with an initial 500000 
contribution or 2000 per student to cover college tuitions 
estimated to reach 17500 by the year 2000 when this years 
firstgraders will enter college 
students preferring jobs or the military would still get a 
onetime 1000 cash payment to cover clothing and travel expenses 
provided they graduate from high school 
you are the hope for our future said merrill lynch chairman 
william a schreyer in remarks prepared for delivery today at rafael 
hernandezlangston hughes elementary school in east harlem 
one of the 16 schools chosen 
that is why we are investing now in your higher education in 
return we want you to stay in school to study well to be free to 
dream important dreams and to know that you can make them come 
true 
in addition to new york the schools are in atlanta boston 
chicago detroit houston los angeles miami and washington a 
school in philadelphia is to be named shortly according to merrill 
lynch 
other corporations and philanthropists have offered similar 
incentives to persuade inner city children to stay in school 
philanthropist eugene lang for example promised 61 east harlem 
sixthgraders full college scholarships if they stayed in school a 
group of businessmen called the 100 black men of atlanta is 
acting as mentors to a class of 28 ninthgraders and is guaranteeing 
their college expenses 
but schreyer said scholarshipbuilder is different from other 
such adoptaclass programs 
our program begins earlier in the childs educational career 
first grade and provides funds not only for college or other 
postsecondary education but also a stipend upon high school 
graduation for students who immediately become fully employed or who 
enter military service 
the foundations future annual contribution could go up or down 
to meet projected average college costs but foundation president 
john a fitzgerald estimated his fund would eventually contribute 
about 8 million which could appreciate to 16 million through 
investments by the time students are old enough to draw upon it 
the urban league chose inner city schools that ranked high in 
orderliness attendance rates parental involvement and other 
effectiveness measures students were chosen at random but with 
an eye toward achieving ethnic and racial balance the league will 
continue to administer the scholarship program including keeping 
tabs on youngsters progress 
asked whether merrill lynch would give preference to those 
students who eventually wanted careers on wall street fitzgerald 
said i would say without committing us that we would if they 
were qualified 
the 15 other schools selected are 
capitol view elementary atlanta david a ellis elementary 
boston anthony overton elementary chicago goodale elementary 
detroit james r reynolds elementary houston 74th street school 
los angeles earlington heights elementary floral heights 
elementary holmes elementary martin luther king elementary 
liberty city elementary lorah park elementary olinda park 
elementary and orchard villa elementary miami and hendley

three men belonging to a skinhead gang 
were charged in connection with the beating death of an ethiopian 
immigrant a week ago police said sunday 
kenneth mieske 23 kyle brewster 19 and steven strasser 20 
were charged in what police said was a racially motivated and 
unprovoked attack on mulugeta seraw 27 who had just been dropped 
off by friends in front of his home 
the friends who tried to intervene suffered minor injuries 
seraw died a short time after the beating in which his attackers 
used a baseball bat 
mieske and brewster were charged with murder and remained in 
custody said detective dave simpson bond for strasser charged 
with seconddegree assault was set at 100000 simpson said 
mieske who also uses the alias ken death was arrested early 
saturday and brewster and strasser were arrested about noon sunday 
he said the three were to appear in district court monday afternoon 
mieske and brewster face additional charges of assault and racial 
intimidation in a sept 10 incident at a grocery store simpson 
said a black security guard and several store employees forcibly 
ejected a large number of skinheads about 11 pm that evening 
in another charge that resulted from the homicide investigation 
but was unrelated to seraws death police and the fbi arrested 
michael c barrett 20 and charged him with unlawful flight to 
avoid prosecution and escape simpson said 
the charge relates to a redwood city calif case involving 
vandalism to a place of worship he said 
the antidefamation league of bnai brith said recently that 
reports of violent crimes have surfaced in every area where skinhead 
groups have organized the civil rights group estimated in october 
there were about 2000 young people actively involved in skinhead 
gangs in 21 states but noted that many youngsters who adopt the 
skinhead look reject the racist element 
the skinhead subculture emerged in london as early as the 1960s 
segments of the movement took on nazi overtones in 1985 and since 
have been supported by and associated with the white supremacist 
aryan youth movement and white aryan resistance 
portland has a skinhead group of about 20 called east side white 
pride with ties to the white aryan resistance according to the 
league it also has a group called preservation of the white 
american race with about 10 members half of whom are women and a 
suburban group youth of hitler the league said 
although police identified the suspects as part of a skinhead 
gang officers did not identify any group by name

the prelate of hereford cathedral which is 
crumbling for lack of cash has provoked a heated dispute among 
churchmen and art experts by putting one of europes greatest 
medieval treasures on sale 
the 708yearold mappa mundi latin for map of the world has 
been kept in the cathedral for centuries and is to be auctioned by 
sothebys in london in june news reports put its value at more than 
45 million 
the sale announcement wednesday prompted a leading member of the 
cathedrals fundraising committee to resign in protest newspapers 
have published angry editorials against the sale and hereford town 
leaders have vowed to fight it 
the map shows historical events bible stories topography 
animals plants and 420 cities on a 6by4 sheet of vellum 
jerusalem is at the center of the map while hereford 144 miles 
northwest of london is drawn on one edge 
the controversy illuminates the dilemma faced by custodians of 
britains national heritage the 900yearold cathedral in hereford 
is one of many in need of cash but sales of treasures such as the 
mappa mundi threaten to put the nations historical heritage into 
the hands of foreign buyers and remove them from britain 
the dean of hereford the very rev peter haynes said in 
announcing the sale of the map that cathedral authorities need to 
clear a 273000 overdraft and spend millions more on repairs more 
staff the cathedrals choir and new premises for its library of 
medieval books 
announcing his resignation from the fundraising committee sir 
roy strong a former director of londons national portrait gallery 
and victoria and albert museum said thursday i was very upset to 
see the dean standing outside his cathedral and holding up the mappa 
mundi its finest treasure for sale to the world 
if that is the kind of church they are running i no longer 
want to be associated with it 
replied john champion chairman of the cathedrals appeal 
committee i am sorry he feels the way that he does put 
bluntly it is a choice of what is more important continuing the 
work of the cathedral or retaining a marvelous medieval 
treasure 
john newman deputy mayor of hereford a town of 48000 said he 
wants queen elizabeth ii as secular head of the church of england 
to intervene 
the map may legally be the cathedrals but morally it belongs 
to the citizens of hereford newman said 
sothebys says that as a national treasure the mappa mundi is 
equivalent to frances 11th century bayeux tapestry depicting the 
invasion of england by william the conqueror in 1066 
georgina nayler deputy director of the national heritage 
memorial fund said we are outraged that one of the most 
important documents in the world is about to be put into an auction 
room 
lord gowrie sothebys chairman strongly denies allegations that 
no effort was made to find a british buyer 
i am sorry that national institutions have not felt able to buy 
this great map said lord gowrie adding that he spent more than a 
year seeking a buyer among governmentfunded bodies such as the 
british library 
the daily telegraph said thursday that chances of the map staying 
in britain appear slim 
critics accuse prime minister margaret thatchers conservative 
administration of starving the arts of adequate government funding 
the government favors sponsorship of the arts by private industry 
dr richard gem of the cathedrals advisory commission for england 
was quoted by the times as saying many other cathedrals in financial 
trouble may have to sell off very important treasures

this is the final installment of an occasional 
series that has told the story of the drought of 88 through the 
eyes of one farm family the chases of barry county michigan 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
gordon and jean chase prayed for rain all 
summer long now they pray for just a few days of sunshine 
in june when hot dry winds blew the dusty dirt off seeds that 
wouldnt germinate when the worst dry spell since the dust bowl of 
the 1930s left crops withered and stunted the chases never 
expected their fields would be too muddy at harvest time 
weve never seen a year like this gordon chase says shaking 
his head weve gone from the worst drought in 50 years to one of 
the wettest and coldest octobers ever one extreme to the other 
from april 1 through midjuly the chases 1100acre cashcrop 
and dairy farm in southwest michigans barry county received barely 
an inch of rain since aug 1 about 18 inches of rain and an inch 
of snow have pounded the weak stalks of corn and wilted soybeans 
more than twice the normal amount of precipitation 
the chases arent alone many of the same midwest farmers who 
struggled through the summers devastating drought were taunted by 
rains that came too late to do any good 
the recent downpours which have forced many farmers to delay 
harvesting their shriveled crops bring the year to a sad ironic 
close 
this will be the first time in the chases 18 years of farming 
that they will have no crop to sell everything they harvest will be 
needed to feed their 300 head of beef and dairy cattle with only 
about half a silo full of highmoisture corn enough to last about 
three months the chases will have to buy from other farmers 
a year like this makes you realize more than ever that the 
weather is the farmers biggest friend or worst enemy chase says 
sinking into a recliner in the couples living room 
he and his wife both 51 estimate they lost about half their 
corn and soybean crop and all of the string beans they were growing 
for a canning company their wheat crop was harvested before the 
drought hit in may 
but the chases dont complain 
at the height of the drought you wondered whether youd have 
anything at all chase says with a shrug 
the loss of their cash crop represents a 30percent cut in the 
chases income to compound their financial plight their expenses 
have been 20 percent higher than normal mostly because of the money 
they spent on irrigation 
but because irrigation only helps when theres some rainfall 
we got zero out of that chase says in disgust recalling the 
summer nights he and his son kurt spent in the fields babysitting 
the irrigation system so that no water was wasted 
the chases are thankful their dairy herd which represents about 
60 percent of the farms income is healthy and productive the 
income they make on their cash crop usually covers their operating 
expenses and pays for the 700 acres of land they rent about 
75000 this year 
its really frightening jean chase says we dont know 
where well get it but itll work out we dont dwell on it 
because it reminds us how horrible that loss really is 
the chases also are thankful they have an understanding lender 
theyre waiting to find out if they qualify for the federal 
governments 39 billion droughtrelief aid program 
but they cant help but think back to their early spring 
projections 
on paper this looked like it was going to be the familys most 
prosperous year ever after managing to save their farm from 
foreclosure three years ago by deeding to the federal land bank and 
leasing it back parcel by parcel the chases expected this year 
would be the one to pay off a sizable chunk of the debt they had 
accumulated 
now all theyd like to do is finish harvesting by thanksgiving 
a goal theyve met every year it seems unlikely this time 
the chases who are in a partnership with son kurt and 
daughterinlaw dena pray for clear skies in order to harvest the 
remaining acres of corn and soybeans 
every time it rains or snows several dry days must follow 
before its safe to take equipment out in the fields theyve 
already had equipment stuck in the mud twice 
now all we can do is pray for a freeze gordon chase says 
but if it snows first thatll just insulate it and itll stay 
wet 
and if the fields arent harvested in the fall it means more 
work in the spring because the fields would have to be cleared 
before planting 
meanwhile the corn still standing in the brown muddy fields is 
growing moldy rendering it useless as feed for the cattle and with 
each pounding rain more of the weak crop is ruined 
still the chases look ahead with hope 
i guess the thought of giving up doesnt enter my mind chase 
says even though it has been a very trying year and very 
frustrating we have a lot to be thankful for and we survive because 
we know next year will be better

conventioneers trying to figure out what to do 
about the homeless didnt have to walk far from their luxury hotel 
in the nations capital to meet the problem facetoface 
mitch snyder who runs a shelter in washington told the 800 
people at the home builders symposium that they were ringed by the 
homeless 
it was not much of an exaggeration 
two blocks from the washington hilton in an alley a 64yearold 
woman in a smudged anklelength wool coat complained about her life 
on the streets since her husband died in 1976 and she lost her 
apartment 
its a crying shame that people have to live this way said 
the woman who is among as many as 15000 people who are sleeping 
these cold autumn nights in the doorways of the nations capital or 
in crowded temporary shelters because they have no place to live 
a couple of blocks further at a subway entrance brian curley 
32 held up a cardboard sign lost apartment to fire please 
help all gifts are welcome 
curley said he can get occasional work with demolition crews for 
70 a day but had not earned enough to afford to eat and to rent 
the cheapest rooms available in washington which he said require a 
150 advance payment for two weeks 
i try not to look like a street person he said but im 
lucky to get a shower hopefully by next week i will have amassed 
enough of a fortune to spend thanksgiving indoors 
estimates of the number of homeless americans range from 250000 
to several million experts agree that they will be a major 
challenge for presidentelect george bushs administration 
all surveys show that the numbers of the homeless are growing 
that they include increasing numbers of families with children and 
that they are found in all parts of the country 
many are people who hold jobs but dont earn enough money to pay 
rent or qualify for mortgages 
the symposium sponsored by the national association of home 
builders and an odd mix of establishment organizations and homeless 
action groups sometimes sounded more like a human rights conference 
or tent revival than a gathering of mostly conservative business 
people 
participants gave a standing ovation on friday to snyder whose 
shelter takes in hundreds of people every night 
snyder who has slept for months on city grates fasted and been 
jailed in his 18year battle for the homeless accused the 
government of turning its back on the nations neediest citizens and 
challenged the builders to cut their profits to help solve the 
problem 
no one has a right to more than they really need to live 
anything beyond that is theft he said 
i may not be dressed as you are but i aint no different 
snyder said standing at the podium in an olive drab jacket and a 
knit shirt open at the collar most of his audience about half of 
them builders were in business attire 
after his speech snyder told a reporter the welldressed crowd 
was made up of decent people who struggle to be decent people 
thats all anyone can expect 
but snyders suggestion that the builders forsake profits to make 
lowincome housing more affordable didnt sit well with some of them 
when you continue to talk about giving up some of your profits 
that aint the way that america works shouted builder leon weiner 
of wilmington del 
weiner said homelessness cannot be treated simply as a moral 
issue he said it requires a strong federal housing policy and 
subsidies of lowincome housing comparable to the billions of 
dollars in tax deductions allowed on home mortgage interest 
kent colton builders association executive vice president said 
many builders have cut profits to build lowincome housing and the 
industry has more than its share of bankruptcies 
builders are willing to be part of the solution colton said 
in an interview but leadership has to come from the federal 
government the new administration has the opportunity to focus on 
the positive side of housing as a national priority 
the symposium included two days of meetings focusing on how 
businessmen and others can help shelter the homeless including 
sessions on creative financing job training and construction 
methods some participants also toured homeless shelters in the 
washington area 
a woman at a floor microphone during one session shouted an 
appeal if we get together and pray together we can do something 
about this situation 
a missouri priest the rev gerald kleba challenged each of the 
nations 400000 church congregations to join local builders in 
constructing one house apiece for the homeless 
abctv anchorman peter jennings in a conference keynote speech 
called the homeless our brothers and sisters 
sen pete domenici rnm said some americans are almost too 
alone to live in a house he said that simply building more 
houses particularly for the mentally ill wont solve all the 
problems 
conventioneers who paid 95 apiece to attend the twoday 
conference passed by huge photographs of sorrowful women and 
children and a naked man standing in a hall before a cluster of 
wheelchairs 
they ate elaborately prepared desserts at the end of a gourmet 
luncheon and then were told that baskets of vegetables serving as 
centerpieces would be donated to a homeless shelter

presidentelect george bush faced with unease 
in the financial markets over the gaping budge deficits today will 
name richard darman to run omb and tap stanfords michael boskin as 
chief financial adviser transition sources say 
bush scheduled a morning news conference today to make what his 
office described only as an announcement about the transtion 
but sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
presidentelect has enlisted darman as director of the office of 
management and budget and boskin as chairman of the council of 
economic advisers 
darman was the right arm of james a baker iii throughout the 
reagan administration both when baker was white house chief of 
staff and later as treasury secretary he played a behindthescenes 
role in negotiating the 1983 rescue plan for social security 
darman was a whiz kid for elliot richardson as secretary of 
health education and welfare in the early 1970s 
boskin is a wellknown conservative economist and expert on the 
social security system he was a father of bushs flexible 
freeze idea to drive down the deficit in four years 
the stock market has sagged and the value of the dollar fallen 
since bush captured the white house nov 8 from fears that his 
notaxhike pledge will impede efforts to bring down the deficit 
now growing by 155 billion a year 
bush has said he takes the deficit seriously and will work with 
democrats in congress to forge a solution 
bush spent a quiet weekend out of the limelight attending church 
sunday jogging and conferring at home with gov john sununu of new 
hampshire his chosen chief of staff 
bush was also meeting today with two former presidents gerald 
ford and jimmy carter who have made some bipartisan recommendations 
for the incoming president 
also on bushs schedule is a meeting with david packard the 
computer magnate who headed a commission that recommended an 
overhaul of pentagon procurement procedures 
bush revealed last tuesday he is keeping his friend nicholas f 
brady as treasury secretary he told reporters friday he was 
concentrating on naming the rest of his economic team before turning 
his attention to defense and national security posts 
in reagans second term darman was deputy to baker as treasury 
secretary both left the government when baker resigned in august to 
run bushs presidential campaign 
boskin argued in a recent book titled too many promises that 
the program should be overhauled to separate its welfare and pension 
functions 
boskin proposed a twotier system with a flat monthly payment 
aimed at helping people stay out of poverty and the second or upper 
tier tied strictly to how much people paid into the system 
currently there is a sharp tilt to social security benefits with 
lowerincome workers getting a far heftier return on their payroll 
taxes than middle and upperincome workers 
bush named baker his longtime associate from houston as his 
choice for secretary of state the morning after the election 
brady who served eight months as a caretaker senator from new 
jersey in 1982 was sworn in two months ago as bakers successor at

the federal employee drugtesting program 
instituted by president reagan will quadruple in size next year 
unless stopped in its tracks by legal challenges 
an estimated 50000 employees were tested this year mainly law 
enforcement officers transportation inspectors and civilians 
working for the military 
but the program is expected to test some 200000 members of the 
31 million federal work force in 1989 according to the national 
institute of drug abuse 
about 150000 to 170000 of those will be tested at random and 
come from a pool of some 500000 workers in positions deemed 
sensitive by their agency chiefs 
the remainder will be tested after accidents or when supervisors 
believe there is reasonable suspicion of drug use 
those figures do not include untold numbers of federal job 
applicants who will be tested if applying for sensitive positions 
nor do they reflect the transportation departments farreaching 
requirement to test nearly four million private sector 
transportation workers from truckers to airline pilots that 
program would begin late next year for businesses employing more 
than 50 workers those with fewer than 50 would have two years to 
get ready for testing 
most suits against testing many filed by unions are in federal 
district or appeals courts only two have been argued before the 
supreme court but neither involves the random testing that has been 
challenged as an intrusive unconstitutional search 
by the first of the year most all of the tier one the 42 
largest agencies the largest chunk of the work force will have 
their programs up and running said dr michael walsh director of 
the national institute of drug abuses office of workplace 
initiatives the office coordinates and approves federal testing 
plans 
the testing program has its origin in a sept 15 1986 
presidential order directing that federal workplaces be drugfree 
besides testing other components include training supervisors to 
recognize symptoms of drug abuse among employees and counseling 
programs at federal agencies 
the counseling is mandatory for those who test positive workers 
can also make voluntary use of the programs as can members of their 
families 
once entering the counseling program after a positive test most 
workers will suffer no disciplinary action if followup tests show 
they refrained from drug use 
the purpose is to get a person back on the job walsh said 
but he cautioned that workers can be disciplined at the discretion 
of their agencies for continued drug use 
in the most sensitive law enforcement and national security jobs 
workers can be fired the first time drug abuse is discovered walsh 
said 
the program has held up well so far in court decisions 
one suit challenged reagans 1986 executive order as 
unconstitutional but a louisiana judge dismissed the action 
a federal judge in the district of columbia held the random 
portion of the armys civilian testing program unconstitutional but 
the us court of appeals in washington invalidated the decision 
pending appeal and the army continued testing 
the transportation departments internal testing program was 
upheld by a federal judge in washington including afteraccident 
testing challenged by air traffic controllers 
in a california case however a federal judge stopped the bureau 
of prisons from testing anyone except applicants for employment 
justice department employees in washington sued their own agency 
to stop random testing and won an injunction in district court 
arguments are set for dec 15 before the us court of appeals 
there has been no decision in a suit challenging testing in the 
veterans administration 
the cases argued before the supreme court on nov 2 involve the 
federal railroad administration and the us customs service but 
since neither involved random testing they might not decide the 
broad constitutionality of the entire testing program 
the fra issued orders in 1985 that required railroads to take 
blood and urine specimens for alcohol and drugs after accidents 
incidents and rules violations 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled last february that 
the tests are unreasonable searches banned by the constitutions 
fourth amendment but the court stayed its decision in order to 
allow an appeal to go forward and testing continued 
the customs service requires tests for anyone applying for a 
promotion or transfer to a job involving drug enforcement that 
program was upheld by the 5th us circuit court of appeals 
testing is obviously a violation of individual privacy and the 
constitution because of its provisions against unreasonable search 
and seizure said diane childers spokeswoman for the american 
federation of government employees a union that has filed several 
lawsuits against reagans program 
she added that random testing does not indicate onthejob 
impairment and requires no probable cause or even reasonable 
suspicion of drug use ms childers said the union does not oppose 
afteraccident testing 
john bolton chief of the justice departments civil division 
disagreed saying were not talking about the exercise of 
government police power or generalized searches of people as a 
whole 
he added theres a diminished expectation of privacy in many 
sensitive federal jobs which begin with an fbi background check 
many of those jobs require a physical exam with urinalysis 
required he said 
bolton said health and human services department guidelines have 
strict test controls procedures for custody of the samples are 
carefully controlled to avoid mixups there are strict criteria for 
testing laboratories test evidence is not to be used in criminal 
prosecutions and theres no observation of the worker giving the 
sample a collection person of the same gender will be in the 
bathroom however 
testing is for five drugs cocaine marijuana pcp opiates and 
amphetamines

the turkeys big day is this week but thanks 
to a lot of scientific derringdo the old bird has turned into a 
yearround sort who is welcome almost anytime 
another result is that pampered commercially grown male turkeys 
have become so large they arent effective lovers so the females 
have to be artificially inseminated 
when founding father benjamin franklin proposed the turkey as the 
symbol of the newly born united states he thought the eagle was 
rather a scoundrel it was the trim hardmuscled wild turkey ben 
had in mind 
the wily wild turkey still thrives in woodlands and is much 
sought by hunters and it is still trim and muscular 
sandy miller hays of the federal agricultural research service 
says franklin might scarcely believe his eyes if he could see 
todays turkey with its blossomed breast and extra servings of 
favored white meat 
hays writing in the agencys agricultural research magazine 
noted that per capita consumption of turkey rose from a paltry 28 
pounds in 1940 to 152 pounds in 1987 this year consumption is 
expected to average 165 pounds and a slight rise is forecast for 
1989 perhaps to 166 pounds 
much of this increase has come since 1980 and can be attributed 
largely to more processed turkey products such as turkey ham turkey 
bologna turkey franks and other items not to mention packaged 
parts 
but before turkey ham and all the others the agriculture 
department had already started to help move turkey production out of 
the doldrums she said in those days after world war ii large 
domestic turkeys were enjoyed for a day or so but a good portion 
of the leftovers lingered on and on and on 
thus most families steered clear of turkeys except for those 
special occasions such as thanksgiving 
in 1947 after a decade of development the usda commercially 
introduced the beltsville small white turkey named after the 
departments research center in beltsville md where the bird was 
developed 
after only seven years in 1954 the beltsville turkey 
represented 28 percent of the 67 million birds produced that year 
the new birds averaged around nine pounds when shipped to market 
compared with 15 pounds or so for the other commercial breeds 
today the genes of the beltsville small white are spread among 
many of the modern breeds one of the prized characteristics was its 
reproductive capabilities says thomas j sexton a poultry 
physiologist and director of the agencys livestock and poultry 
sciences institute at beltsville 
sexton said the small white female could crank out more than 100 
eggs in six months handily topping the output of other commercial 
breeds 
another benchmark development came in 1980 when sexton and other 
agency researchers hit upon the beltsville poultry semen extender a 
mixture that allowed turkey semen to be stored for six to eight 
hours without losing viability 
all commercial turkeys are produced from artificial insemination 
if we left it up to nature the reproductive rate of domestic 
turkeys would be about half of what it is now sexton said if 
you artificially inseminate a flock you can expect a 90 to 95 
percent fertility rate in the eggs produced but in a naturally 
mated flock you might get 45 to 50 percent 
sexton said the male turkey used for breeding may average 40 to 
50 pounds compared with 25 pounds or less for the female 
and theres a big difference in attitude in these big males 
he said theyre more interested in eating than mating 
before the beltsville poultry semen extender was perfected 
turkey semen had to be used within 30 minutes after it was 
collected that meant the toms had to be on the same farm with the 
females 
the extender sent most of the toms to market and allowed those 
remaining to be bunched together on turkey stud farms sexton said 
sexton said the extender allows a single male to inseminate as 
many as 40 females a week compared with only about 10 before 
the nations turkey output jumped sharply in 1987 to a record of 
more than 240 million birds and another 5 percent increase is 
expected this year according to the departments economic research 
service 
half a dozen states produce more than twothirds of the turkeys 
led in 1987 by north carolina and followed by minnesota california 
arkansas virginia and missouri

after their first postelection meeting the 
democrats are determined to avoid wholesale revisions of their rules 
but are ready to consider major changes in the presidential primary 
and caucus calendar 
the 1992 presidential campaign may see a drastically altered 
super tuesday and find iowa and new hampshire deprived of their 
firstinthenation status 
everybody thinks the thing ought to be shortened said texas 
democratic party chairman bob slagle echoing a sentiment expressed 
by several of his colleagues 
im going to tell you everybodys damn tired of rules 
changes said slagle and i think the average democrat thinks 
were absolutely insane if we get into another big battle about 
rules 
they want us to worry about how were going to win elections 
sam goddard the arizona chairman speaking for the western 
states said we are concerned in our region about the timing and 
sequence of the presidential primaries and caucuses 
one idea that got a lot of favorable attention at the meeting of 
the association of state democratic chairs was to hold a lottery to 
determine which states would lead off the process 
while not endorsing the proposal national party chairman paul g 
kirk jr called it an idea worth considering 
kirk said that if the parties move toward regional primaries 
there ought to be one or two smaller states that begin the 
process 
one regional primary that may not be repeated in the form it had 
in 1988 is super tuesday the day that most southern states agreed 
to hold their primaries 
the motivation behind super tuesday was to give the process a 
more conservative voice but the big winner on that day was jesse 
jackson and the eventual nominee was massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis 
kirk called super tuesday too large and too widespread to 
give the region an effective voice 
john baker chairman of the alabama democratic party and kathy 
vick a former louisiana party chair both said they opposed 
continuation of super tuesday 
baker said he favored moving the alabama primary to june when the 
state votes to nominate candidates for other offices 
that move said baker would save the 12 million it costs to 
hold a separate presidential primary 
baker and vick also endorsed the idea of asking congress to enact 
lottery legislation or some other method of shortening the primary 
season and removing iowa from its status as the first state to begin 
selecting delegates 
after their fifth defeat in the last six presidential elections 
many democratic officials are saying that iowa plays too much of a 
role in defining the nominating campaign debate 
neither the republican nor democratic caucus winner in iowa won 
his partys nomination but the state was the scene of most of the 
early campaigning 
for the democrats in particular that meant pressure to take 
stands on defense and other issues that party officials now feel 
were out of touch with the feelings of most voters 
another issue that dominated discussion at the state chairs 
meeting was the question of whether kirk would agree to serve 
another four years as chairman 
kirk disclosed that among those urging him to seek another 
fouryear term were dukakis and lloyd bentsen the partys 
presidential and vice presidential nominees 
but kirk said he had not made up his mind and would not until 
after thanksgiving

when presidentelect george bush chose lee 
atwater to pilot the republican party into the 1990s it was a 
warning and an opportunity for the democrats 
atwater is the nations leading practitioner of the politics 
aint beanbag school of campaigning the man who made rapist 
willie horton a household name and turned the pledge of allegiance 
into an attack on michael dukakis 
there was nothing pretty or ennobling about the strategy atwater 
pursued as manager of the bush presidential campaign 
but it worked and his candidate carried 40 states and will become 
the 41st president of the united states on jan 20 
dukakis and his handlers consistently underestimated atwater and 
his tactics 
in the euphoric spring and summer days when the massachusetts 
governor had doubledigit leads in every poll democrats generally 
shrugged off the attacks on the massachusetts prison furlough 
program and the questions raised about dukakis veto of legislation 
to require public school teachers to lead the pledge of allegiance 
dukakis partisans called the attacks typical of atwaters 
fondness for negative campaigning the bush campaign manager was 
panicking they said 
they were wrong atwater had a far better understanding of 
dukakis vulnerabilities than did the democrats 
now the bush campaign manager is undertaking a different role at 
a critical political juncture 
from the initial reaction of democratic state party leaders they 
dont intend to make the mistake of underestimating the young 
political tactician from south carolina 
were ready to take on lee atwater and those who create a pit 
bull style of politics said rick wiener chairman of the michigan 
democratic party 
i dont intend to get outmuscled said bob slagle the texas 
democratic party chairman i dont intend to let them play that 
kind of game with us and win it 
the democrats were sending a clear message we can get just as 
tough and negative as atwater 
but they went beyond that they also were jumping at an 
opportunity to make atwater himself a political issue 
one of the ironies of the 1988 campaign was that while voters 
opinion of dukakis was formed to a great extent by the bush attacks 
they objected to the negative tone of the campaign 
the question now is whether there is enough of a hangover from 
the nasty tone of the presidential campaign to tar atwater 
democratic party chairman paul g kirk jr was asked if he looked 
forward to working with atwater the way he had often cooperated 
with current gop chairman frank fahrenkopf 
kirk gave a lowkey response but made his point 
i dont know lee atwater he said but from what ive seen 
he probably brings a slightly different approach to the public 
domain and politics than i would have 
warming to the subject he continued i want to be fair to lee 
atwater if thats not being too naive i dont want lee atwater 
setting the tone for politics in the 1980s and 1990s at least from 
what ive seen in the most recent campaign 
the stakes will be high for both parties when atwater assumes his 
new role just before inauguration day in january 
in the presidential campaign atwater was operating in an area 
where the republicans have a builtin advantage going into 1988 
gop candidates had won four of the last five presidential elections 
bush made it five of the last six 
but when atwater takes over at the republican national committee 
hell be trying to overcome a big democratic advantage in 
congressional and local elections 
the 1990 elections will determine who draws the new district 
lines for the house of representatives as well as for states 
legislatures 
right now the democrats control 28 state legislatures while the 
republicans are a majority in only eight in 13 states each party 
controls one of the two legislative bodies nebraska has a 
nonpartisan unicameral legislature 
in addition 28 of the nations 50 governors are democrats 
the importance of redistricting was demonstrated in the last two 
elections when only a handful of incumbents seeking reelection were 
defeated 
the political success of house incumbents suggests that the only 
possibility of a major shift in the party lineup comes once every 10 
years in the election following the redrawing of district lines to 
comply with a new census

the average american earned 18200 last year 
compared with the equivalent of 8362 for the average citizen of 
the soviet union the central intelligence agency says 
the figures are contained in the cias recently released 
handbook of economic statistics 1988 which compared actual 
purchasing power 
the cia figured the total production of 2438 million americans 
in 1987 was worth 4436 trillion while 284 million soviets 
produced 2375 trillion 
americans also live longer to enjoy their prosperity 75 years to 
69 for the average soviet according to the cia but residents of 
several other countries have longer average lifespans than those of 
americans 78 years in japan 77 in italy holland and canada and 
76 in france and west germany 
the agency said the united states had the highest average income 
in the leading western industrial countries known as the group of 
seven canada was second with 17080 followed by west germany with 
13360 japan 13180 france 12780 britain 12260 and italy 
12080 
the cia did not give figures for switzerland where according to 
the world bank average income was higher than in the united states 
21250 compared with 18430 
communistruled countries were well behind with east germany 
doing best at 11873 according to the cia 
the average in china was only 273 compared with 4320 on 
taiwan among other countries of east asia hong kong did best with 
8250 followed by singapore with 6810 and south korea was last 
at 2810 
the cia said us economic production grew last year at a rate of 
29 percent compared to a soviet increase of just 05 percent but 
it said the soviets devoted a larger proportion of their income to 
investment than americans and a smaller proportion to consumption 
economists consider this relationship important since investment is 
seen as the key to the wealth of the future 
the soviets though they still import much of their grain from 
the united states have been improving their own farm production 
faster 17 percent more in 1987 than in 1980 compared with a 4 
percent increase in the united states 
prices paid by soviet consumers also have been rising more 
slowly 14 percent since 1980 compared with 38 percent in the 
united states 
the cia said its information on communistruled countries came 
from official data its own estimates or estimates made by other 
organizations

less than a year after the death of 
his cancerstricken wife dr peter rosier shocked television 
viewers when he admitted i administered something to terminate 
her life 
now the 47yearold fort myers pathologist is on trial here on 
charges of firstdegree murder attempted murder and conspiracy to 
commit murder in the jan 15 1986 death of patricia rosier his 
wife of 23 years 
mrs rosier 43 suffered from lung cancer which doctors say had 
spread to other organs 
the state contends the interview broadcast nov 12 1986 
amounted to a confession rosier admitted his wife didnt die of 
cancer he said she wanted to die before the situation became 
horrible and that he merely helped her on her way 
there was no question patricia rosier wanted to end her life 
said assistant state attorney ed volz who expects to finishing 
presenting his case before thanksgiving the trial now in its 
fourth week was moved from southwest florida because of extensive 
pretrial publicity 
rosier gave his wife 20 pills of secanol a strong sedative 
and when that didnt work he gave her morphine injections then 
morphine suppositories prosecutors said 
during the trial however mrs rosiers stepfather vincent 
delman has described in detail how he smothered her after rosiers 
botched attempts 
i decided to gently cover her nose and mouth delman 
testified demonstrating on himself for the jury i didnt give it 
a second thought i didnt get any pulse i didnt hear any 
more sound 
delman 68 a retired new york dentist said he was afraid she 
might become a vegetable after rosier left her unconscious and 
lingering near death for 12 hours 
he obviously didnt do such a good job delman said adding 
that he decided enough is enough 
he testified as a key state witness under a grant of immunity 
no charges were filed against him because he and his two sons 
russell and farrell delman successfully negotiated an immunity 
agreement before prosecutors knew the extent of their involvment 
they are the states star witnesses 
the defense said the state was taken 
this is not a murder case it is wrongful prosecution said 
defense attorney stanley rosenblatt who hasnt decided yet whether 
to put rosier on the stand prosecution is a facesaving device 
however the state maintains it had no choice without the 
delmans testimony there was very little on which to build a case 
no autopsy was performed and mrs rosier was cremated 52 hours 
after her death 
even if they had known beforehand prosecutors still would have 
extended immunity to the delmans testified james fitzpatrick lead 
investigator 
it changed nothing he said rosier orchestrated his wifes 
death 
through a prior arrangement permitted in terminally ill cases 
rosier called the lee county medical examiners office and told 
coroners officials his wife was dying she was placed on an expected 
death list no autopsy would be necessary a death certificate 
signed by one of her treating physicians attributed death to lung 
cancer according to testimony 
attorneys for both sides agree the couple made a double suicide 
pact after mrs rosiers cancer was diagnosed in spring 1985 
but rosier didnt go through with it for the sake of his 
children jacob now 19 and elizabeth 21 volz said

civil rights activists say a decision by the 
supreme court to stay on the sidelines in a louisiana case leaves 
the field clear for their attempts to give black voters more say in 
the selection of state judges 
frank parker an attorney with the lawyers committee for civil 
rights said the courts refusal last week to hear louisianas 
appeal of a ruling that the voting rights act applies to state 
judicial elections gives the green light to lawsuits challenging 
the election process for judges in six states 
the suits have been filed in alabama georgia louisiana texas 
illinois and ohio 
the lawsuits represent a new wave in litigation under the 1965 
law which has been used by legal activists during the past decade 
to force hundreds of local governments and school boards across the 
south to abandon atlarge elections of their members 
the demise of atlarge elections has coincided with a huge 
increase in the number of black elected officials at the local 
level between 1977 and 1987 the number of blacks on county 
commissions school boards and city councils nationwide increased 
from 3515 to 5490 
theyre trying to accomplish exactly the same thing with the 
judiciary that theyve accomplished with legislative offices said 
david boyd an alabama attorney hired to represent the state in a 
lawsuit challenging the election method used for circuit court and 
district court judges 
parker said activists initially focused on removing barriers to 
the election of blacks to legislative offices because thats where 
policy is set and laws are enacted 
now he said the challenges directed at state judicial systems 
may be even more important in ending racial discrimination 
in terms of the impact this litigation has its very high 
he said judges have the power to put people in jail for long 
periods of time they have the power to put people to death the 
business of state courts is very critical to the lives of 
minorities 
the lawsuits contend that atlarge elections of judges violate 
the voting rights act by diluting black voting strength and denying 
blacks an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice 
in an atlarge judicial election two or more judges are elected 
by all the voters of a jurisdiction created by the state the 
lawsuits contend that black voters have little chance to elect 
judges of their choice when they live in majoritywhite 
jurisdictions even though they may constitute a majority in a 
specific section of the jurisdiction 
that argument already has prevailed in three states in north 
carolina a federal lawsuit challenging the method of electing 
superior court judges was withdrawn after the democraticcontrolled 
legislature last year adopted a new judicial districting plan 
acceptable to civil rights advocates 
in mississippi where the first lawsuit using the voting rights 
act to challenge state court elections was filed in 1984 a federal 
judge divided eight districts where state court judges were elected 
atlarge into 22 singlemember districts including 14 that are 
majority black the first elections under the new plan will be held 
in february 
in louisiana a federal judge ruled in favor of civil rights 
activists in a similar lawsuit and instructed the legislature to 
develop a new election plan for state trial court judges that does 
not violate the voting rights act 
the louisiana case that reached the supreme court last week 
involved a challenge to the atlarge election of two state supreme 
court justices from a district made up of four parishes the 
lawsuit still awaiting trial asks for the creation of two 
singlemember districts with one being majority black 
louisiana officials argued that the voting rights act should not 
apply to judges because it only covers representatives of the 
people namely members of the legislative and executive branches of 
the government 
the supreme courts decision not to hear louisianas appeal 
leaves the issue of whether the voting rights act applies to 
judicial election without a final resolution for the time being 
but some lawyers who are using the voting law to challenge state 
judge elections say the courts silence suggests that it believes 
the law does apply particularly since several state judicial 
systems already are being revamped because of rulings based on the 
voting law 
i think the court would have taken the first one it had if it 
disagreed with the lower court because they wouldnt want a state 
to go through the change and two years later say now its time to 
look at this said neal bradley an american civil liberties 
union attorney who is representing the black voters in the georgia 
lawsuit 
georgia attorney general mike bowers however said he sees no 
hidden meaning in the supreme court decision he said the courts 
action last week wont stop him from contending that the voting 
rights act does not apply to judicial elections in georgia

food and tobacco giant rjr nabisco inc on sunday 
extended its deadline for buyout offers after a potential new bidder 
said it was considering making a record offer of up to 266 billion 
the tentative proposal for rjr nabisco from a group led by the 
investment firm first boston corp and the pritzker family of 
chicago would be nearly double the biggest acquisition on record 
chevron corps 134 billion purchase of gulf oil corp in 1984 
the first boston proposal its first expression of interest in 
the consumer goods giant easily topped two sweetened offers made by 
rjr management and the buyout firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
rjr nabisco which is based in atlanta is the nations 19th 
biggest industrial company and the maker of hundreds of consumer 
items that range from jose cuervo tequila and salem cigarettes to 
life savers candy and milk bone dog snacks 
the offers disclosed sunday top all previous bids and a special 
rjr committee that is running the auction indicated that its 
decision to extend the bidding period could produce even higher 
offers 
due to the varying potential values and nature of the 
consideration offered in the two bids and the proposal and the 
varying terms conditions and contingencies associated with each 
the special committee determined not to make any recommendation at 
this time regarding any of the proposals said charles e hugel 
the committees chairman 
the fivemember committee of rjr nabiscos board of directors 
also said it would accept bids through nov 29 the panel had 
initially cut off bidding at 5 pm last friday 
the preliminary offer by the first bostonpritzker group would 
involve the acquisition in 1989 of rjrs tobacco business which 
accounts for about 40 percent of its annual sales followed by the 
installment sale of its food businesses 
first boston indicated the total consideration could range from 
98 to 110 cash a share plus securities and stock warrants valued 
at from 7 to 8 a share the warrants would entitle rjr 
shareholders to acquire up to 20 percent of the tobacco business 
at 118 a share the maximum possible offer from the group would 
be 266 billion 
the committee said the managementled group which is allied with 
the investment firms shearson lehman hutton inc and salomon 
brothers inc had raised its offer to 100 a share in cash for 175 
million of the companys 2253 million outstanding common shares 
the group said it would acquire the remaining shares for 56 
cash plus securities and common stock in the surviving company that 
it said would bring the total consideration to 100 a share the 
common stock would equal about 15 percent of the surviving companys 
outstanding shares according to the special committee 
the 100 a share offer values rjr at 225 billion the 
management groups previous offer had been for 92 a share or 207 
billion 
the new offer by kohlberg kravis which previously had offered 
90 a share or about 203 billion included 94 cash a share for 
about 178 million rjr nabisco shares with the remaining shares to 
be exchanged for preferred stock and securities the firm valued at 
94 a share giving its offer an indicated value of about 212 
billion 
management started the bidding a month ago when it announced it 
was considering a buyout offer and kohlberg kravis quickly entered 
the fray with a competing bid 
both parties submitted firm offers to the rjr committee by 
fridays deadline but they said late sunday they were undecided 
whether to make new offers

efforts to fix problems that stopped 
production at the only us facility able to produce nuclear weapons 
material intensified today with the addition of extra control room 
shifts at the savannah river plant 
federal officials also are expanding their onsite control as 
part of a sweeping safety drive that makes it unlikely the plant 
will meet a dec 31 goal for resuming production 
creating an extra fifth shift for each of the plants three 
reactors means that one of the 14member controlroom teams will be 
undergoing training at any given time 
the crews will double the time they spend each year on a computer 
simulator up to 150 hours and classroom work will be expanded as 
well said charlie ahfield a du pont reactor program manager 
putting federal officials permanently inside each reactor 
facility for the first time will allow the government to keep a 
closer eye on their operation which has been run since 1950 under 
contract by the ei du pont de nemours co 
the changes are designed to improve safety at the sprawling 
300square mile site in a pine forest along the savannah river 
where more than 16000 employees work under tight security 
the scene is surprisingly tranquil outside k reactor the first 
of the three scheduled to return to operation inside the massive 
concrete and reinforced steel structure workers use remotecontrol 
cranes and arms to prepare the reactor for restart 
they had set a target date of dec 31 but i would think it 
would be after the 31st said andy cwalina a du pont reactor 
supervisor no new date has been announced 
changes also are taking place in the administration complex a 
beehive of activity said stephen r wright a 14year veteran of 
the plant and deputy manager of the energy department team preparing 
to restart k reactor 
the reorganization which began several years ago widened this 
fall 
the top energy department safety official richard w 
starostecki warned in september that some senior federal officials 
at the plant had an attitude toward production reactor safety 
which on the face seems to be similar to that which existed in the 
space program prior to the challenger accident 
such criticism raises hackles at savannah river 
nasa killed 10 people we never injured anybody with a nuclear 
accident said andy cwalina a reactor supervisor referring to 
the seven people killed in the challenger shuttle disaster and three 
killed in the national aeronautics and space administrations 
earlier apollo program 
our people have never hesitated if they were concerned about 
safety to order a reactor shut down said cwalina one thing 
that we are learning is that you have to instill confidence among 
your overseers that you are operating a reactor safely 
that means convincing washington the aging reactors can run 
safely at 100 percent power rather than the 50 percent ceiling they 
have been under since a critical report last year by the national 
academy of sciences 
safety measures being instituted at savannah river include 
raising operating standards to the same level as those attained 
by commercial nuclear utility plants in the wake of the accident at 
three mile island in march 1979 that will take years according 
to wright a key to this is developing detailed mathematical models 
of how the reactor core behaves especially during problems 
establishing a paper trail from the cradle to the grave 
for important steps said wright before i used an informal note 
now i use a quality control form and more people receive copies 
assuring that each shift is supervised by an operator who holds 
a bachelors degree in science or engineering nine of the 12 shift 
teams meet that standard now 
an increase in oversight from washington an increase in line 
control an increase in overview and management and du pont is 
increasing its overview said wright 
in one key change engineers from the energy department regional 
office at the plant will be stationed permanently at each reactor 
and managers and inspectors who previously visited the reactors only 
on a spot basis will be going out considerably more said wright 
the biggest increase will be technical review engineers these 
are the guys that will be living out there plus there will be 
technical inspections said wright 
us officials say the nation still has enough nuclear materials 
for weapons for the time being 
plutonium supplies are adequate according to energy secretary 
john s herrington but tritium which decays at the rate of 55 
percent per year could be running short by next summer say 
administration and capitol hill sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity

ending a threeday visit to india 
mikhail s gorbachev joined with prime minister rajiv gandhi in 
urging the united nations to help establish a coalition government 
in afghanistan 
a unsupported international conference may be needed for 
this purpose the two said in a statement released before the 
soviet president returned home sunday night 
the communique did not reflect a change in the kremlins 
position but it coincides with increasing soviet efforts for a 
political settlement of the war after nine years of soviet military 
intervention the war still rages 
under a unsponsored accord signed in april the soviet union 
is to complete the withdrawal of its troops from afghanistan by feb 
15 about half the estimated 100000 soviet soldiers have left 
although the withdrawal of troops was halted earlier this month 
because of recent rebel successes 
gorbachev and gandhi also signed an agreement for the soviet 
union to build two nuclear reactors for an indian power plant 
during the visit the soviet union and india concluded agreements 
for economic scientific and cultural programs worth 53 billion 
said an indian foreign ministry spokesman 
the statement on afghanistan said the process of national 
reconciliation should be encouraged 
national reconciliation is the term president najib of 
afghanistan has used in his efforts to persuade anticommunist 
guerrillas to stop fighting and participate in his government 
gorbachev and gandhi appealed to un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar to implement without delay a nov 3 un 
resolution that calls for an end to foreign interference and for the 
creation of a broadbased government in afghanistan 
the soviet union has been distancing itself from najib and his 
sovietstyle peoples democratic party of afghanistan as the 
deadline for the red army withdrawal approaches but it has provided 
new warplanes surfacetosurface missiles and economic aid to 
bolster the government 
on saturday gorbachev accused the united states and pakistan 
the chief backers of the afghan guerrillas of creating obstacles 
in settling the afghan problem 
the nuclear power agreement signed by gandhi and gorbachev calls 
for the soviet union to build two 1000megawatt reactors within 10 
years in southern tamil nadu state 
it was not disclosed what safeguards the soviets would impose for 
indias largest nuclear power project india has been hampered in 
getting western assistance for its nuclear projects because it has 
refused to open its plants for international inspection 
india advocates nuclear disarmament but has refused to sign the 
nuclear nonproliferation treaty saying the pact discriminates 
against developing nations 
the soviets and indians also agreed to cooperate in the 
exploration of space in the coming decade

george bush won the presidential election with 
a boost from dozens of wealthy supporters who pitched in by giving 
100000 or more to the republican party gop records show 
in addition to the republican team 100 roster of people who 
gave at least 100000 a list released by party officials shows 
millions more collected from supporters who gave amounts ranging 
upward from 5000 
the republican national committee made public a list of 
contributors who gave about 20 million to its socalled soft money 
account money that legally cannot be donated directly to a 
presidential campaign but which the party can spend on a variety of 
electionrelated activities that end up benefiting the presidential 
candidate 
the republicans had a banner year with their soft money program 
the records show allowing them to more than double the 46 million 
in public funds that the presidential nominees are allowed to spend 
themselves that money comes from the 1 voluntary checkoff on 
individual income tax returns 
the rnc list of heavy hitters includes such gop stalwarts and 
longtime reagan loyalists as walter annenberg and trammell crow as 
well as corporate donors such as rjr nabisco revlon occidental 
petroleum and coca cola 
new york real estate mogul donald trump gave 100000 
also listed is william stamps farish iii a multimillionaire oil 
man and horse breeder who hosted bush his close friend on the 
presidentelects postelection beach vacation last week in gulf 
stream fla 
farish is listed as having given 75000 
also listed were henry hillman and elsie hillard hillman of 
pittsburgh pa who hosted bush during the florida vacation on a 
yacht cruise with several friends 
but the list the rnc gave to reporters may reveal only a portion 
of the amount a given contributor actually has donated 
rnc officials said this list which includes 78 donors who gave 
100000 did not include all the contributors and did not give a 
full accounting for the donations because some people also gave 
money also to separate victory 88 accounts that the party set 
up in each state 
money given to these accounts often at highdollar fundraisers 
attended by bush while he was on the campaign trail was not brought 
into the rnc accounts in washington 
party officials have refused to disclose those funds and are not 
required by law to do so 
the democrats also had an active soft money program and have 
disclosed receipts 
the soft money system is criticized by many as a blatant loophole 
that gets around electionlaw limits on political spending 
it enables the parties to accept money that otherwise would be 
barred from presidential campaigns including corporate money and 
individual donations exceeding the 1000 cap set by election law 
the money was used for generic party advertising 
getoutthevote efforts and such things as buttons and bumper 
stickers

john wilkes booth wasnt a shiftless actor 
who killed abraham lincoln out of despondency over the souths loss 
in the civil war but a confederate intelligence agent a new book 
contends 
confederate leaders sanctioned the assassination as a lastditch 
effort toforce the north into peace negotiations three former us 
intelligence officers wrote in come retribution recently 
published by the university press of mississippi 
booth also used an underground intelligence network for his 
escape after shooting lincoln during a performance at fords theatre 
in washington dc on april 14 1865 five days after gen robert 
e lees surrender at appomattox the authors contend 
the book challenges the longheld belief that in the closing 
months of the civil war the confederacy stubbornly held out against 
surrender even though it had no hope of winning its independence 
william tidwell one of the authors wrote in a recent article 
it shows instead that the confederates had a welldeveloped 
plan for the campaign of 1865 which they believed would result in a 
southern victory or at least a stalemate 
the confederacy had wanted to kidnap lincoln but when that plan 
failed it plotted to blow up the white house tidwell said the 
bombing plan was aborted when a confederate demolition expert was 
arrested tidwell said 
southern leaders finally decided to kill lincoln demoralize the 
north and begin a last ditch offensive tidwell said lees 
surrender of the army of northern virginia had virtually ended the 
war by that time but booth thought he could save the south by 
killing lincoln said tidwell a retired cia officer 
tidwells coauthors are james hall a retired labor department 
official who served in army intelligence during world war ii and 
david winfred gaddy a former national security agency official 
tidwell said the three used their intelligence experience to 
reexamine the assassination and uncover what they alleged was a 
wellestablished conferederate intelligence network they examined 
thousand of documents in the national archives over a 10year period 
our evidence is largely circumstantial tidwell said 
basically we are trying to tell our story by putting together 
many small pieces of information each well documented 
the authors contend booth was not helped during his escape by 
strangers or a ragtag band of sympathizers hastily assembled before 
the assassination instead booth appears to have followed the main 
confederate underground network leading from washington to the 
confederate capital in richmond va the book contends 
of the 17 who helped booths escape the authors were able to 
link 12 with the confederacy eight of whom had participated in 
confederate intelligence activities 
the authors also elaborate on the activities of a southern 
intelligence operation that spied in washington new york and 
chicago 
the books title comes from a code system the confederate 
intelligence used in which a certain word or phrase was used to 
decipher messages 
come retribution was the last code key used by confederate 
intelligence tidwell said a chart used to decipher the code was 
found among booths effects after he was shot by union soldiers 11 
days after the assassination of lincoln

terrence m scanlon a democrat who has 
promoted voluntary safety programs as the reagan administrations 
chairman of the consumer product safety commission is resigning to 
take a post with a conservative think tank 
the heritage foundation said sunday that scanlon would become 
vice president and treasurer of the organization effective jan 3 
one of the highest ranking democrats in the reagan 
administration scanlon has run his agency with a philosophy close 
to president reagans emphasis on voluntary safety programs and 
cooperation with industry 
consumer advocates attacked his approach and urged promoting 
product safety more aggressively but scanlon responded that 
voluntary programs can be established more quickly than government 
regulations 
you can do a voluntary standards approach at the same time you 
have an enforcement program he said in a telephone interview 
scanlon said that under his leadership the independent agencys 
civil penalties against companies violating safety standards reached 
an alltime high 
scanlon cited as a major accomplishment of his tenure at the 
agency an agreement last year to cooperate with the us customs 
service in halting imports of unsafe products before they reach 
domestic store shelves 
a former aide to presidents kennedy and johnson scanlon served 
in the small business administration and commerce department before 
he was appointed to the safety agency 
he was the agencys chairman from december 1985 to december 1986 
but had to relinquish the post when congress failed to confirm his 
appointment within a year 
the delay coincided with an investigation of charges that scanlon 
had used the commissions staff for personal projects he was 
exonerated of any criminal wrongdoing and was confirmed as 
commission chairman in july 1986 
the commission consists of five members and a quorum of three is 
needed to conduct business currently only three commissioners are 
serving because congress has not provided funds for the two 
remaining positions 
scanlons departure would leave only carol dawson and anne graham 
as commissioners too few for the agency to conduct business 
scanlon will be in charge of fund raising and financial 
management at the heritage foundation which also has attracted 
several former reagan administration officials including former 
attorney general edwin meese and former un ambassador charles 
lichtenstein

william schinkel says he didnt know he 
had a criminal record until he was barred entry into the united 
states 
after a us customs officer did a computer check schinkel 41 
was told there was a record of a narcotics offence cultivation of 
marijuana that meant he wasnt allowed into the country 
four years ago police seized two marijuana plants from 
schinkels garden at his home in white lake ontario near arnprior 
when he went to court schinkel received a conditional discharge 
and the judge told him he was a lucky man because he wouldnt have a 
criminal record 
but the united states records as convictions all sentences handed 
down by canadian courts discharges included 
as far as we are concerned a conditional discharge is the same 
thing as a conviction said john hogan port director for us 
immigration at alexandria bay ny we dont recognize canadian 
pardons either 
schinkels experience points out something pretty outrageous 
said ottawa lawyer bob wakefield the whole intent of the 
discharge provisions in canadian law is to remove any stigma any 
prejudice attached to the person involved 
but whats really amazing here is we are supplying us 
officials with information about discharges knowing it is being 
used in a manner that clearly undermines the intent of canadian 
law 
the legal hitch meant trouble for schinkel a woodworker 
when he was refused entry to the united states in march at 
cornwall ontario schinkel determined not to cancel a florida 
vacation tried again down the road at the ivy lea bridge near 
gananoque ontario 
another computer check showed schinkel had tried to cross the 
border only a few hours before and schinkel says us customs 
officials held him for 4 hours for questioning 
he said he was was photographed fingerprinted and officials 
confiscated his girlfriends pickup truck and sent him back across 
the bridge on foot to canada 
six months later schinkel says he got the truck back after 
paying a 500 us penalty

an offcourse bull moose nicknamed 
bullwinkle was looking for a mate but probably attracted only 
cameratoting spectators 
on saturday morning roger bonsall said the 6foottall 
900pound moose stopped for a drink at a drainage ditch at his farm 
about 10 miles west of liberal a southwest kansas town of 15000 
people 
the moose which sports a hefty set of antlers spent the day 
there lying under some trees and allowing 50 to 75 sightseers to 
get a good look 
a lot of neighbors stopped by to take pictures and he didnt 
seem to mind that bonsall said hed just sit there and look at 
you he did have some dogs bark at him he got up and chased one of 
them a little bit 
by sunday morning bonsall said the moose hit the road 
officials from the kansas department of wildlife and parks said 
bullwinkle may be the same bull moose that moved through kansas this 
fall and was last seen in texas 
it sounds like the same one said mike ehlebracht a 
conservation officer he said the moose was seen around the saline 
river in september then traveled through kansas and oklahoma before 
being spotted in texas that moose which had a 40inch rack of 
antlers was one of two moose spotted in kansas this fall 
ehlebracht said moose visits to kansas are unusual but during 
the fall mating season a bull moose will take off looking for a 
place to call home and just keep right on going

youd think an 81yearold texan would be 
satisfied with a string of careers that reads star of radio 
records movies and tv broadcast czar real estate tycoon baseball 
mogul 
but singing cowboy gene autry is back in the saddle with a new 
pursuit preserver of the american west real and legendary at a 
museum underwritten with more than 50 million from his foundations 
the gene autry western heritage museum which opens tuesday 
traces the west from prehistory to conquistadores to lewis and clark 
to cowboys to hollywood images 
its meant as a gift to the world not a monument to himself 
said autry who first sang on radio in 1928 made 95 films had a tv 
show from 1950 to 1955 and cut 635 records including rudolph the 
rednosed reindeer silverhaired daddy of mine and the 
signature back in the saddle again 
autry hung up his performing spurs in 1956 and by the mid60s 
owned part or all of nine radio and tv stations four hotels the 
california angels 16000 acres in colorado oil music publishing 
a movie studio along the way he started collecting western 
memorabilia and art 
i felt that i owed something the west has been very kind to me 
over the years said autry whose net worth is about 230 million 
according to forbes magazine 
i figured that the least i could do is leave something for the 
youth so they can see what it was all about 
autrys tiledotted spanishstyle museum has seven main 
galleries with 51000 square feet of space each featuring a 
spirit or aspect of the west the building cost 34 million and 
houses 20 million worth of exhibits 
it has two exhibition halls a theater library and restaurant on 
13 acres in griffith park 
he had been thinking about this for 30 years 40 years 
collecting artifacts of the west as he went from town to town 
said the museums executive director joanne d hale 
the exhibits were designed by disneys imagineering team to 
delight as well as instruct bridles and sixshooters gleam like 
jewels suspended on clear plexiglass holders items behind glass in 
the galleries come to life in a 3d movie with magic disney 
pioneered at its theme parks 
the aim is to capture not only the west romanticized by artists 
authors and hollywood but the reality of frontier life said 
curator james nottage 
you expect that someone is going to save pistols owned by 
custer so its not surprising that we have those nottage said 
the hard items to find are the common ones 
so were proud of things like a simple day dress from the 
1840s what are the odds of an item like that surviving 
nottage shows off a collections of items used by mexican cowboys 
the original range riders such as a mid1700s saltillo serape worn 
to ward off the weather he hopes to expand the museums displays of 
items about women minorities and business people in the west 
but its the romance of the dime novel and matinee thats the 
long suit for now 
visitors can toss a leg over a saddle and fire a sixshooter as 
they become part of a movie using the television technique that 
superimposes weather reporters over their weather maps 
or they can just peruse 
guns owned by annie oakley wyatt earp jesse james saddles 
from buffalo bill cody and broncbusting legend yakima canutt 
autrys own guitars their necks inlaid with his name in 
motherofpearl 
cecil b demilles camera from the 1914 version of the squaw 
man the western often described as the first fulllength picture 
shot in hollywood 
costume after costume tonto and the lone rangers getups 
clint eastwoods pale rider long coat the eyeassaulting 
glitter of countrywestern outfits from nudies rodeo tailors of 
north hollywood 
ed bohlin show saddles dripping with what looks like a ton of 
silver 
among autrys favorite items are an 1870sera steam fire engine 
from nevada a collection of theodore roosevelt memorabilia and a 
collection of more than 100 guns from colt including several made 
for presidents which autry purchased from the famous firearms 
company 
they were actually offered more money than i paid for it he 
said but whoever was bidding on it was going to sell some of the 
most important items maybe trying to get their money back so i 
told the people at colt the collection would not be broken up

the us should help promote human rights in 
indonesia instead of turning its back on abuses for the sake of 
stability a private american human rights monitoring organization 
said 
asia watch said in a report released sunday that rights abuses 
including torture by police and political killings on the southeast 
asian archipelago continue but that the region is stable enough for 
the us to press its ally for more improvements 
neither the us embassy nor the us state department has 
placed promotion of human rights high on its agenda of foreign 
policy goals in indonesia asia watch said 
these issues demand increased attention among us officials 
because throughout the 1980s formal controls on political life 
have expanded and and a broadening crosssection of 
indonesian society has suffered politicallymotivated human rights 
violations including police torture and killings and lack of free 
press or speech 
asia watch attributed american silence to the persuasive power 
of the cult of stability among washington policymakers 
indonesian president suharto has deftly deflected criticism 
from abroad by continuing to evoke images of the instability 
associated with the tenure of president sukarno who ruled with 
communist support before suharto took power in 1965 
asia watch singled out the former portugese colony of east timor 
which indonesia annexed 13 years ago as an example of indonesias 
violation of human rights despite what the report said were 
improvements on the island residents continue to suffer daily 
violations of fundamental rights and indonesia fails to account 
for thousands of missing people believed killed in custody 
asia watch is affiliated with americas watch and helsinki watch 
which monitors compliance with the 1975 helsinki eastwest 
conference agreements on security and cooperation

6480 off the price of a house or an extra 20 canadian off 
the price of winter coats for the kids this year the us 
congress has already approved the measure 
at least one worker thinks the letter is an attempt to intimidate 
employees into voting for the progressive conservatives the 
governing party and architects of the controversial deal 
the liberals and new democratic party oppose the pact 
they should give people free choice thats the way its 
supposed to be one loblaws worker was quoted as telling the 
toronto star newspaperi dont think they should do anything like 
that

only his head and shoulders were visible 
above the witness box as the boy calmly told a murder trial jury 
how when he was 2 years and 10 months old he watched as his aunt 
was grabbed and thrown down by a man with a knife 
i saw a knife in his case on his belt i thought it was a 
gun the boy said softly recounting events that took place eight 
years ago she was like pulling around his shoulders and pushing 
him away from her 
from divorce battles to child abuse cases to murder trials child 
witnesses once rarely seen in court are appearing regularly in 
thousands of proceedings legal and psychiatric experts said 
opinion varies widely on the reliability of child witnesses and 
on whether the stress they suffer in a courtroom is worth the 
testimony they provide psychiatrists cite symptoms like nightmares 
confusion and guilt in young witnesses 
its not that difficult at all to get a child to say nay to 
questions the child was saying yea to a few minutes before 
defense attorney frank mondano who was involved in a child abuse 
case against a massachusetts day care center said of 
crossexamining children 
you dont know whether they are with you or in a childlike 
world 
prosecutors said the testimony of the 11yearold boy in 
middlesex superior court last month was critical in the murder case 
against william brown who was accused of stabbing the boys 
12yearold aunt to death but the boy couldnt positively identify 
brown as the attacker the jury failed to reach a verdict and the 
case must be retried 
many methods have been used to smooth the road for child 
witnesses some have been struck down as unconstitutional others 
have withstood appeals 
in minnesota a child frozen with fear was permitted to testify 
from beneath the prosecutors table 
in philadelphia a 5yearold used a doll to demonstrate how her 
father allegedly beat her younger sister as a hushed courtroom 
watched the girl tossed the doll in the air after it landed on the 
floor the girl walked down from the witness stand and began 
punching it in the stomach 
where child victims used to be rare now youre seeing many 
more children coming into the system and that has required making 
some accommodations said jane walsh a middlesex county assistant 
district attorney who has worked on many child abuse cases 
other changes include mandatory psychiatric evaluations before a 
child is allowed to testify special training for judges handling 
child witnesses and victimwitness advocates in prosecutors 
offices who work with families to make the experience less stressful 
children are quite honest said dr robert nardone head of 
new england medical centers child psychology center who frequently 
evaluates potential child witnesses 
if they are giving you an accurate version they are 
consistent he said a lot of people are concerned they are 
being prepped you usually can tell 
the stress associated with testifying can be especially acute 
when a child is asked to give evidence against a parent or other 
relative in a child abuse case said dr alayne yates chief of 
child psychiatry at the university of arizona 
problems can include staying awake at night ruminating about 
what they said and feeling responsible for the person being in 
prison and very sorry she said 
the younger the witness the more acute the stress said yates 
adding that when she began her career in 1973 such cases were 
extraordinarily rare 
the number of child abuse cases nationwide has more than tripled 
in a decade according to the american association for protecting 
children a denverbased organization 
in 1976 there were 669000 cases but by 1986 the number jumped to 
21 million of those about 40 percent are substantiated to the 
point where they may be brought to trial said association 
researcher brandon ruiz 
in most of those trials the testimony of the child victim is 
required to prosecute the case 
judges are less willing to put children through the trauma of 
testimony in divorce and custody battles than in criminal cases but 
children are often asked to take sides in a battle between parents 
parents sometimes falsely accuse one another of sexual abuse to win 
custody yates said 
the child is liable to lose contact with a father whos a 
valuable parent and sometimes whether the abuse happened or not 
they come to the feeling that it must have happened she said

lee harvey oswald bore a grudge against texas 
gov john connally and may have intended to kill him instead of 
president john f kennedy according to a new book 
oswald was angry because connally had done nothing to help 
restore his honorable discharge from the marine corps according to 
the book the great expectations of john connally by james 
reston jr son of the new york times columnist excerpts of the 
book were published in this weeks time magazine 
oswalds discharge was downgraded to undesirable one step above 
dishonorable after he tried to sell military secrets to the soviet 
union that he had acquired as a marine corps radar operator reston 
wrote 
oswald lived in the soviet union for a time and at one point 
attempted to renounce his us citizenship 
from the soviet union oswald wrote to connally who had been 
navy secretary for help in having his military discharge upgraded 
reston wrote 
oswald apparently did not know that six weeks earlier connally 
had resigned his navy position to reenter texas politics and his 
office sent oswald a perfunctory reply reston wrote 
oswald had been spurned by a fellow texan and he resented 
it reston wrote 
alexandra de mohrenschildt a member of the small russian emigre 
community in fort worth told the warren commission which 
investigated the assassination of jfk that oswald had never 
mentioned kennedy 
it was the governor of texas connally who was mentioned 
mostly reston quoted de mohrenschildt as saying for some 
reason lee just didnt like him maybe it was the dishonorable 
discharge 
connally was riding in the car with kennedy in dallas on nov 22 
1963 and was seriously wounded in the shooting 
restons book will be published this year by edward burlingame

john sununu the arabamerican whose appointment 
as white house chief of staff upset some jews says the key to a 
middle east peace is to guarantee the integrity and strength of 
israel as a sovereign nation 
sununu made the statement in an interview published today in the 
jerusalem post adding that he expected presidentelect george bush 
and incoming secretary of state james baker to pursue peace in the 
region 
i think theyre smart enough to know that its in this 
countrys us interest to deal with the tough issues and no one 
can stay that its not one of the great tough issues he said 
referring to the arabisraeli conflict 
when asked if he had strong feelings about the middle east 
because of his arab ancestry he replied i have feelings in this 
sense i think that as time has moved forward that we have 
opportunities to move toward peace 
he told the post it was in israels interest the united 
states interest frankly everyones interest to achieve peace and 
tranquility in the middle east 
for example he said for israels longterm economic 
situation peace would be a tremendous asset to stay under the 
constant tension that we seen is over the past few decades is not 
good 
noting that assuring israels sovereignty was the key to any 
peace settlement sununu said that has to be made clear 
sununu who is of lebanese descent aroused anger among some 
israeli and american jews when as governor of new hampshire he 
refused to sign a petition calling for repeal of a united nations 
resolution equating zionism with racism 
he was the only american governor who did not sign the document 
saying at the time he believed it was not his business as a governor 
to try to dictate foreign policy 
in the interview with the post sununu defended his record on 
israel noting that he drafted the middle east plank in the 
republican platform which is regarded as proisraeli 
sununu confirmed he had been a member of the national association 
of arab americans but said he was a thirdgeneration american who 
visited lebanon only once in 1949

jillians billiard club has 39 tournament pool 
tables no beer no jukebox and a dress code and the posh billiard 
parlor is packed with the games new upscale clientele 
the club opened in july on the third floor of a former warehouse 
and similar clubs have been popping up in cities across the country 
patrons include men and women most between 25 and 40 many on 
dates no betting is allowed and a resident professional gives 
lessons for 25 an hour 
the tables are in spacious rows on a polished maple floor 
surrounded by a brass railing and deep carpeting dark green 
curtains hold back sunlight from arched windows 
many evenings players must take numbers and cool their cues in 
an adjoining cafe until a table opens corporate customers mainly 
brokerage firms and management consultants have taken to renting a 
back room and part of the main floor for private parties 
such success has not gone unnoticed 
manager and coowner kevin j troy said prospective pool hall 
owners from other cities have been coming through jillians at a 
rate of about one a week 
upscale pool halls have opened in new york miami and dallas and 
others are planned in los angeles and the florida cities of tampa 
and orlando according to james j bakula director of operations 
for brunswick corp the nations largest pool table manufacturer 
the old image of pool was that it was dangerous there were 
hustlers dark rooms grubbiness people losing money people 
getting robbed said mark cord assistant director of the billiard 
congress of america a trade association in iowa city iowa 
but lately pool is associated more with something being classy 
there are these classy rooms opening up in the big cities and there 
is constantly magazine advertising using pool tables you see a 
slinky lady leaning up against a table and a guy in a tuxedo 
advertising ralph lauren the same thing with christian dior 
jordache theyve all done that 
ron blatt whose family firm in new york city has made custom 
pool tables since 1923 said pocket billiards was a gentlemans game 
fancied by railroad magnates and oil tycoons from the 1890s until 
the 1930s but with its spread to neighborhood bars and bowling 
alleys during and after world war ii it took on a toughguy image 
blatt attributed the games yuppie attraction both to the 
madison avenue ad campaigns and to a 1986 movie the color of 
money which starred paul newman and tom cruise as pool hotshots 
newman won an oscar for recreating fast eddie felson the 
character he played in the 1961 movie the hustler 
some think the upscale pool craze began in japan two years ago 
after the color of money played there bakula said brunswick has 
shipped more than 1000 tables to the orient over the last two years 
brunswick doubled its annual production from 8000 to 16000 
tables since 1986 he said but still could not keep up with the 
demand last year and had to turn away some japanese orders

the recent conviction of a ring charged with 
smuggling exotic birds from cuba provided a glimpse into the 
lucrative enterprise of importing illegal animals which has found a 
base of operations in southern florida 
there is an insatiable appetite for animals of all kinds 
said thomas quinn one of nine special state wildlife agents in 
florida whose job includes stalking animal smuggling operations 
if you have the money you can get the animal thats how it 
goes 
subtropical florida a hub for latin american cargo flights has 
emerged as the nations center for legitimate exotic animal import 
firms whose inventories range from darting fish to sluggish tree 
sloths 
but demand by highpaying customers tempts some of the companies 
to forge inventories and try other schemes to bring in prohibited 
animals as well 
the smugglers like the parrot ring try to blend into the legal 
animal traffic and hope to escape notice from inspectors said quinn 
ive seen fake bottoms in crates fake invoices boxes marked 
they are filled with venomous snakes to try to discourage 
inspection people will try just about anything to get these animals 
in said quinn im to the point now where nothing shocks me 
officials estimate 36 companies and 300 individuals in southern 
florida are licensed by the state to deal in the international 
animal trade many bring in several large shipments of fish mammals 
or reptiles each week with only a handful of state and federal 
inspectors to check the contents 
were overwhelmed said inspector patrick hyde of the us 
fish and wildlife service in miami if we could check all the 
shipments we would the sheer volume of the animal traffic is just 
too much 
animals imports are regulated by state statutes and other laws 
such as the lacey act which bans interstate transportation of rare 
species 
internationally inspectors watch for violations of the 
8yearold covenant on international trade of endangered species an 
agreement signed by 120 nations that sets bans on some animals and 
strict limits on others 
but the more scarce an animal becomes the more its sought by 
smugglers some exotic birds such as the blackpalmed cockatoo from 
southeast asia fetch up to 25000 each a bengal tiger brings 
between 10000 and 15000 
we see a lot of these real expensive animals turn up in the 
homes of the drug dealers down here said quinn among the 
dopers having these animals is a real status symbol 
federal drug agents found a small zoo including two cheetahs and 
a leopard when they raided the miami property of an alleged drug 
trafficker last summer 
animals are affected by trends just like fashion said 
quinn one time cobras were popular then it was black animals 
then albino animals were hot it comes in cycles 
quinns single best advantage is surprise unannounced he combs 
the warehouses around southern florida and pokes into cages and fish 
tanks 
its like going to a casino he said you never know when 
youll hit the jackpot

a federal judge has barred the city and state 
from cutting off services to 9000 retarded philadelphians who live 
at home saying the irrational decision threatened the 
recipients health and safety 
us district judge raymond j broderick issued a permanent 
injunction forbidding philadelphia and the state from eliminating 
vocational familysupport earlyintervention recreational and 
casemanagement services to mentally retarded people who live with 
their families 
in his ruling thursday the judge said that to deprive mentally 
retarded people of services they need for living and working would 
result in irreparable injury and cause serious regression to 
many he also said it would violate the equalprotection and 
dueprocess clauses of the constitution 
the order will continue until further notice from the court the 
judge said 
a projected 68 million shortage in state funds prompted the 
city in june to announced plans to reduce or eliminate services for 
mentally retarded philadelphians who live at home and are registered 
with the city for mentalretardation assistance services for 
mentally retarded people in statefunded group homes were not 
affected 
the judge ruled that the citys decision affecting services to 
the retarded living at home and not to those living in statefunded 
residences was arbitrary 
there has been a lack of judgment an irrational lack of 
fairness the constitution demands that defendants should have found 
a better way to resolve the problem broderick wrote 
the judge did not say whether the city or state must fund the 
services he did note however that the city has contributed 3 
million annually in excess of its 10 percent match 
state law requires the state to provide 90 percent of the funding 
for such services and counties are to pay 10 percent and provide the 
services themselves 
in july 32 people and the philadelphia police and fire 
association for handicapped children inc filed a classaction 
lawsuit against the city and state department of public welfare 
alleging that the citys mentally retarded were being denied their 
rights to lifelong community support 
broderick issued a temporary restraining order effective aug 1 
that prohibited a cutback in services and later extended it until 
last friday 
the attorney for the plaintiffs david ferleger hailed the 
ruling as a landmark 
no court has ever held that there is a guaranteed right to 
community services for people with retardation living at home 
ferleger said 
deputy city solicitor guy vilim said the city would review the 
opinion before deciding how to proceed

the convictions of mob boss nicodemo little 
nicky scarfo and 16 associates have taken the guts out of a 
deadly philadelphiasouthern new jersey crime family a prosecutor 
says 
a federal jury saturday night convicted scarfo 59 and 16 
associates in a racketeering conspiracy that included murder drug 
dealing loansharking and illegal gambling 
one of the things that this case did was it broke the myth of 
the mafias invincibility said assistant us attorney louis 
pichini 
pichini said the convictions crippled the crime family because of 
the number of defendants involved and their high rankings in the 
organization 
with one conviction we were able to take the guts out 
pichini said 
each defendant was found guilty on each of the two main 
conspiracy counts they faced in addition some were found guilty on 
other charges they faced individually 
sentencing was not immediately scheduled by us district judge 
franklin van antwerpen all face possible sentences of from 40 to 55 
years in prison scarfo is already in prison on an unrelated 
conviction 
scarfos attorney robert simone said he would appeal the 
verdict reached after 26 hours of jury deliberations 
i think in terms of taking down the entire power structure of 
the family this is the first time that that has really occurred 
said joel friedman head of the us organized crime strike force in 
philadelphia what weve done here is really stopped them 
while other convicted mob leaders such as the late vito 
genovese continued to rule during jail terms law enforcement 
officials said scarfo doesnt have the clout influence or savvy to 
follow suit 
i believe scarfos days as a leader in organized crime are 
over said col clinton pagano superintendent of the new jersey 
state police 
however pichini and friedman cautioned that the verdict doesnt 
mean the end of organized crime in the area because philadelphia 
has been lucrative new yorkbased mobsters may move in friedman 
said 
scarfo is serving a 14year prison term for conspiring to extort 
1 million from a philadelphia developer he and six others still 
face conspiracy charges in philadelphia in the 1985 ganglandstyle 
slaying of mob associate frank frankie flowers dalfonso

thailand after 25 years of excavation 
and restoration has unveiled one of asias great buddhist centers 
and an ancient royal capital from its golden age 
peeling away centuries of jungle growth and soil experts have 
partially restored 193 buddhist temples moats kiln sites and other 
structures which 700 years ago were part of the powerful city of 
sukhothai 
these form the 27squaremile sukhothai historical park which 
was formally opened although the public has had access to the area 
for some time 
officiating at sundays opening ceremonies was princess 
sirindhorn a scholar of thai culture and eldest daughter of king 
bhumibol adulyadej the latest in a royal line that thais regard as 
having begun in 1253 with the first king of sukhothai 
the bid to save sukhothai from destructive vegetation and thieves 
began in 1953 but stalled several years later work resumed in the 
mid1960s and received a boost in 1978 when the thailand and the 
un educational scientific and cultural organization began a 10 
million renovation plan 
sukhothai was included in unescos campaign to restore 31 world 
cultural sites 
its opening comes during heightened consciousness in thailand 
about the theft of its art treasures earlier this month the art 
institute of chicago returned an ancient stone sculpture smuggled 
out of the country to the united states in the 1960s 
decapitated statues and pilfered kiln sites at sukhothai are 
testimony to the loss of heritage but a leading thai art historian 
prince subhadradis diskul told reporters recently that what remains 
within the guarded wellattended park should be secure 
however other thai experts have expressed concern that outlying 
areas where archaeological work is under way are vulnerable to 
antique hunters 
although unesco provided valuable expertise the overall 
restoration concept was worked out by thais and involved the use of 
nonoriginal materials to flesh out temples and even the addition of 
missing parts to giant statues of the lord buddha 
although a more purist approach is normally preferred in the 
west the thais argued that the restoration should appeal to the 
general public as well as to the buddhist faithful who dont like to 
worship before headless images 
the thai government which avidly promotes tourism also hopes 
the restored monuments will attract more visitors officials say 
about 500000 thais and foreigners are expected to visit this year 
some view the tourist boom as a danger to the tranquility and 
natural beauty of the area in the past guidelines and regulations 
on tourist development in thailand have been violated by private 
entrepreneurs 
beyond tourist revenue officials say restoration of sukhothai 
which translates as dawn of happiness is a national duty given 
the citys central place in thai history and culture 
the kingdom lasted less than 150 years but shaped many aspects of 
contemporary thailand including the theravadda buddhist religion 
thai script notions of kingship and relatively egalitarian social 
relations were also developed 
at its height the kingdom controlled an area stretching into 
modernday laos burma and malaysia its artists and architects 
broke with the cultural dominance of cambodia to create new styles 
especially in depicting the buddha in bronze images 
but internal strife eventually weakened sukhothai and power 
shifted to the south and the kingdom of ayuthaya in 1378 the 
capital itself was abandoned in the 16th century

israeli troops shot to death a 22yearold 
palestinian and wounded 11 others in clashes in the occupied lands 
and arab and israeli moderates claimed the protracted uprising has 
increased prospects for peace 
at a forum six israeli peace activists and arab moderates on 
sunday praised the plo parliamentinexiles declaration of an 
independent state as a message of peace and acceptance of israels 
existence 
the declaration was a reward to the palestinian people who 
have been struggling for 11 months and a message to the israelis 
that the palestinian people accept a jewish and palestinian state 
sidebyside said hanna siniora a proplo newspaper editor from 
east jerusalem 
siniora said the revolt that pits rockthrowing palestinian 
youths against heavily armed soldiers made the israeli people 
realize that there were another people living under occupation 
here 
israeli leftists at the forum in tel aviv echoed his sentiments 
the point is no longer who controls the land said s izhar 
an israeli author the point is we can no longer sit on the heads 
of 15 million palestinians and rule their physical and political 
lives this occupation is destroying us 
abie nathan a leading peace activist said i think the 
chances for peace are better now than they ever were in the past 
its time to realize that rocks and bullets wont accomplish 
anything nathan said im sure the arabs will make more 
concessions and then there will be pressure on prime minister 
yitzhak shamir from the united states and american jewry and he 
will be forced to moderate his position 
on sunday the violence continued as one palestinian was fatally 
wounded during an army raid in the west bank village of baqa 
five arabs were beaten during an israeli army raid on the west 
bank village of madama arab doctors said six others were wounded 
by bullets in incidents in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
hospital officials reported 
sundays death raised to 314 the number of palestinians killed 
since antiisrael rioting began dec 8 in the territories israel 
seized in the 1967 middle east war eleven israelis have also died 
speaking in english to a largely israeli audience in tel aviv 
siniora who has been mentioned as a palestinian negotiator 
acceptable to both israelis and palestinians called on israel to 
end the violence by negotiating with the plo 
we are extending our hand with an olive branch to call to your 
neighbors to take the first step toward peace with us he said 
israeli peace activists also called on their government to begin 
negotiations 
the plo pragmatism has come about despite israels hostility 
said matti steinberg a middle east researcher at the hebrew 
universitys davis institute i hope their pragmatism will soon be 
recognized in our community 
but in jerusalem israels cabinet called the palestine national 
councils declaration of an independent state in israels occupied 
territories a jumble of illusions 
the government said the declaration could not contribute to peace 
because the palestine liberation organizations parliament had 
neither renounced terrorism nor explicitly recognized israel 
the plo was and remains the main obstacle for peace and all 
those that support the plo in this matter are hurting peace an 
official statement released after sundays cabinet meeting said 
elsewhere an israeli soldier was killed and four others injured 
when their armored personnel carrier overturned in a road accident 
sunday in southern lebanon the army said 
israel radio said the accident occurred north of the lebanese 
city of naqoura two miles from the israeli border

pope john paul ii has beatified mother 
katharine drexel praising the philadelphiaborn heiressturnednun 
for devoting her life and fortune to fighting racism against blacks 
and american indians 
about 10000 people packed st peters basilica for sundays 
ceremony in which the pope also beatified three franciscan 
missionaries stoned to death in ethiopia in the early 18th century 
in becoming blesseds of the roman catholic church the four 
took a step toward possible sainthood 
mother drexel who was born in in 1858 became a nun in 1891 and 
founded the sisters of the blessed sacrament to work among blacks 
and indians she opened nearly 60 schools and missions mostly in 
the west and southwest 
a member of a prominent philadelphia banking family she gave an 
estimated 20 million to further her orders work before her death 
at age 96 in 1955 
mother drexel seemed to grasp the fundamental truths which many 
of her contemporaries failed to grasp for example the truth about 
the equal dignity and worth of every human being regardless of race 
or ethnic origin the pope said 
in her day american indians and blacks in the united states 
suffered great injustices as a result of racial prejudice the 
pope said in english seeing clearly the evil of this situation 
she set out with determination to combat and overcome it 
john paul said mother drexel focused her efforts on establishing 
catholic schools 
he noted that mother drexel came to rome in 1887 to ask pope leo 
xiii to send missionaries to her schools for indians and the 
pontiff persuaded her to become a missionary herself 
mother drexel established her first school in 1887 st catherine 
indian school in santa fe nm she opened other schools in wyoming 
montana california and oregon 
the order also set up a catholic school system to serve blacks in 
13 states with 30 convents from virginia to louisiana in 1925 
mother drexel founded xavier university in new orleans the first 
predominantly black catholic university in the country 
archbishop anthony j bevilacqua of philadelphia said mother 
drexel is remembered for her undaunted spirit of courageous 
initiative in addressing social inequities among minorities 100 
years before such concern aroused public interest in the united 
states 
among the more than 1000 people who traveled from the united 
states for the ceremony were cardinal john krol of philadelphia 
sister juliana haynes president of the order about 200 black 
catholics and dozens of american indians 
also present were 22 distant cousins of mother drexel including 
three current trustees at philadelphias drexel university which 
was founded by her uncle banker anthony joseph drexel in 1891 
there are no survivors of her immediate family 
the vatican this year cleared the way for mother drexels 
beatification by approving a miracle attributed to her intercession 
robert j gutherman a bucks county pa teenager who lost hearing 
in his right ear from an infection reportedly regained hearing in 
1974 after his parents prayed for mother drexels intervention 
to become a saint the vatican would have to confirm a second 
miracle attributed to her intercession 
the franciscans beatified were german liberato weiss and italians 
samuele marzorati and michele pio faoli the three were martyred on 
march 3 1716 outside gondar in ethiopia 
the three had been sent to ethiopia to open ecumenical dialogue 
with the abyssinian church but were condemned for their religious 
work and stoned to death

president roh taewoo was quoted as 
saying today he wants to resolve the controversy involving his 
predecessor chun doohwan and indicated the former leader would be 
pardoned 
roh made the remarks as the 56yearold chun reportedly was 
preparing to make a public apology for alleged corruption and other 
misdeeds during his sevenyear term in office 
i will take actions under the principle that any wrongdoings by 
a chief executive should be dealt with politically and that any 
political reprisal would only hurt democratic development the 
seoul shinmun newspaper quoted roh as saying 
chun had planned to leave seoul tuesday to live in seclusion in 
the countryside but the plan was delayed because of difficulty in 
finding him a safe rural home news reports said 
chun is expected to apologize at a natioally televised news 
conference wednesday newspapers quoted chuns aides as saying he 
also is to turn over most of his wealth to the government and accept 
rural exile a traditional way of repentence for disgraced korean 
leaders 
the former president who stepped down in february denies any 
personal wrongdoing but about a dozen of his relatives and 
associates have been convicted or charged with corruption involving 
millions of dollars in public funds 
dongailbo newspaper said chun would leave immmediately after 
reading his statement wednesday to live in a mountainside buddhist 
temple or near an army unit in the northern part of the country 
chun the paper said needs a refuge where he will be safe from 
attacks by radicals and other opponents 
other newspapers said he might move to the countryside in central 
south korea but not to his hometown in the south where residents 
reportedly oppose his return 
national assembly hearings on abuses under the chun government 
focused today on attempts to stifle press freedom more than 700 
journalists were blacklisted and many newspaper and broadcast 
operations were placed under state control by the chun 
administration 
chun has been a virtual prisoner in his luxurious seoul house 
guarded by hundreds of riot police to prevent attacks by dissidents 
opposition groups have held major protests and tried to march on his 
home to demand his arrest 
president roh taewoos government is under criticism for trying 
to protect chun and the government is trying to defuse public anger 
without being implicated in the furor 
yonhap the south korean news agency said the government was 
considering a probe by prosecutors against chun if his apology and 
surrender of property does not satisfy the public 
there have been increasing numbers of street protests urging 
chuns arrest in recent weeks over the weekend thousands of 
students and dissidents battled riot police in downtown seoul after 
police stopped a march to chuns house 
chun a former general took power with military backing in 1980 
he was succeeded by roh another former general and a close chun 
associate

shoot down who he said were the real assassins the two policemen 
who fired at him 
mrs gandhi was gunned down oct 31 1984 in the garden of her 
official residence by satwant singh and a fellow sikh bodyguard 
beant singh

a southern rebel leader denied ordering 
missile attacks on aircraft including one that damaged a plane 
carrying many of sudans military heirarchy a government minister 
said today 
the plane carried 60 people including defense minister 
abdulmaguid khalil 
osman omer minister for construction and public works said 
rebel commander john garang said he has held off ordering his sudan 
peoples liberation army to escalate the war even though a 
tentative new agreement to end 5 years of civil war has not been 
implemented 
omer said garang made the statements in a telephone conversation 
sunday with his negotiating partner mohamed osman mirghani 
on sunday military spokesman brig mohamed osman malik blamed 
the incident on garangs rebels after maliks comments prime 
minister sadek mahdi said the incident proved garang has lost 
credibility the rebel movement is not serious about its peace 
claims 
mirghani is patriarch of the democratic unionist party a junior 
partner in sudans governing coalition omer said prime minister 
sadek mahdi was with mirghani when garang told him he gave no orders 
for shooting this plane or any other plane garang spoke from 
his headquarters in addis ababa ethiopia 
last thursday unidentified men fired a sam7 missile at a 
hercules c130 just after it took off from the besieged city of wau 
in southern sudan with the defense minister the army 
commanderinchief and other top military commanders aboard 
the missile badly damaged the planes engine and control system 
but the pilot managed to maintain control and landed without injury 
or other damage 
rebel broadcasts from ethiopia took responsibility for the 
shooting down of two civilian aircraft in southern sudan in 1986 and 
1987 that killed more than 70 people the first in august 1986 
prompted mahdi to cease contacts with rebel leaders that had held 
early promise of agreement 
the incident came a day after an initial ceasefire agreement was 
signed in addis ababa between garang and mirghani 
mahdi and other political leaders have endorsed the peace 
initiative although the prime minister has not discussed the issue 
publicly since the shooting 
garang took up arms in 1983 in a quest for autonomy and economic 
administrative and social reforms in southern sudan its christian 
and animist africandescended people traditionally have been 
dominated by the ethnic arab moslems of the north

a judge has refused to set aside a 700000 
award against two newspapers saying they committed calculated 
misdeeds when they published a sources name after promising him 
confidentiality 
officials of the star tribune of minneapolis and the st paul 
pioneer press dispatch the states largest papers said they were 
not surprised by saturdays ruling and would appeal 
the case concerns a suit filed by dan cohen who claimed during 
trial in july that he lost his advertising job after the newspapers 
misrepresented and breached an oral contract they made to keep his 
name out of a politically sensitive story 
cohen had leaked court documents to reporters during the 1982 
gubernatorial campaign that revealed that marlene johnson a 
candidate for lieutenant governor had been arrested for shoplifting 
several years earlier 
cohen who worked for rival gubernatorial candidate wheelock 
whitney provided the information on the condition that he not be 
identified as the source 
editors at the newspapers testified that they overruled their 
reporters promises of anonymity because the public had the right to 
know the information came from the whitney campaign 
but hennepin county district judge franklin knoll ruled that the 
first amendments guarantee of freedom of the press did not shield 
the newspapers against cohens breach of contract claim 
the courts have made it clear that no first amendment interest 
exists in protecting news media from calculated misdeeds 
knolls memorandum said certainly the knowing and willful breach 
of a legally sufficient contract after hours of thought and 
discussion by corporate officers can fairly be characterized as a 
calculated misdeed 
knoll also dismissed the newspapers argument that a relationship 
between a reporter and a source is anything other than commercial 
the advertising war currently being waged by one newspaper 
against the other is ample evidence of the profit motive underlying 
their operations he said 
its our intent to appeal said john t henry publisher of 
the pioneer press dispatch we were hoping for a different 
outcome but this was not unanticipated 
tim j mcguire managing editor of the star tribune said his 
newspaper also will appeal the decision to the minnesota court of 
appeals

populist leader benazir bhutto met 
with the leader of an ethnic indian immigrant party today to try to 
forge an alliance that would make her the first woman prime minister 
of an islamic country 
the pakistan peoples party led by ms bhutto captured the 
largest bloc of votes in wednesdays national election but fell 
short of a majority in the national assembly 
ms bhutto who has said she expects to be the countrys new 
prime minister is seeking the support of elected independent and 
smaller parties to form a governing majority 
she met today with altaf hussain leader of the mohajir quami 
movement which came in third in the election and represents ethnic 
indian moslem immigrants 
wasim sajjad minister for justice and parliamentary affairs 
announced today that president ghulam ishaq khan intends to persuade 
ms bhutto and her conservative rival nawaz sharif to unite in a 
coalition government sajjad said khan will meet separately with the 
two leaders tuesday 
a government spokesman who requested anonymity said the 
discussion with the two major party leaders will be to form a 
broadbased government its only natural 
but ms bhutto said she will not accept a coalition with sharif 
whose islamic democratic alliance was second in the election 
officials said 
last weeks vote the first free elections in pakistan since 
1977 had no majority winner 
ms bhuttos party won 93 seats in the 237member national 
assembly compared to 55 for the rightwing islamic democratic 
alliance led by sharif the remaining 68 seats contested went to 
independents minor parties and nonmoslem candidates 
ms bhutto 35 says she has enough recruits among newly elected 
members of the national assembly to command a majority in the 
chamber and expects the president to ask her party to form the new 
government 
in voting for provincial assembly seats on saturday ms bhuttos 
party was only able to obtain an outright majority in one of the 
countrys four provinces 
she virtually swept her home province of sind in southern 
pakistan but in the heavily populated punjab province where 60 
percent of the countrys 107 million people live the majority went 
to the rightwing alliance 
in pakistan the senate national assembly and the four 
provincial assemblies elect the president who is head of state the 
president in turn has the power to name the prime minister 
however the constitution has two clauses on naming a prime 
minister 
one gives the president discretion both in timing and selection 
of a prime minister the other originally meant to apply to 
elections held after 1990 requires the new legislature to convene 
first and the person with the majority of votes to head the 
government 
ms bhutto maintains that the 1990 provision applies to the 
current situation pakistans military leader gen mohammed zia 
ulhaq had added the 1990 provision to the constitution after 
deciding he would continue as president with the powers to decide 
prime minister until 1990 
zia died in a plane crash aug 17 just weeks after calling 
national elections zia ousted bhuttos father former prime 
minister zulfikar ali bhutto in a bloodless 1977 coup and had 
bhutto executed two years later

state legislators are asking university of 
louisville officials to reconsider banning smoking in some parts of 
the campus and are threatening to cut the schools budget if they 
dont 
the general assemblys tobacco task force meeting sunday gave 
the state university until dec 5 to change its proposed campus 
smoking policy kentucky is the nations leading tobacco grower 
if the university doesnt back down itll open up the 
awfullest can of worms said the rep clay crupper chairman of 
the house agriculture committee 
crupper said the legislature has the ultimate weapon the budget 
the proposed policy disclosed last week and scheduled to take 
effect by the new year would prohibit smoking in common areas such 
as stairwells hallways and reception areas cafeterias would be 
divided into smoking and nonsmoking areas 
dan hall a university administrator told the legislators that 
the university is willing to rethink this provision and maybe have 
something more balanced 
ill take back to campus tomorrow what youve said hall 
said i hear you loud and clear 
he also said the policy is not meant to be antitobacco or 
antismoking but to better balance the rights of smokers and 
nonsmokers on our campus 
if the university doesnt back down other committees including 
those dealing with agriculture small businesses and labor and 
industry will take up the cause crupper said 
crupper initially called on the task force to approve a 
resolution asking the university to back down but he later agreed 
to give the university until the task forces dec 5 meeting to 
revise its policy 
the provision of the policy that most offended legislators sunday 
night was a clause that resolves otherwise irreconcilable conflicts 
between smokers and nonsmokers in favor of the nonsmoker 
crupper said that if a restrictive policy is enacted at the 
university of louisville it would spread to other state 
universities 
sen fred bradley said im concerned with the precedent it 
would set and the impression it would give people 
the states total income from tobacco production in 1984 was 23 
billion and that led to 126 million in taxes according to 
taskforce chairman rep donnie gedling

israels 12th parliament today opened on a 
fractious note as 15 leftist legislators refused to be sworn in by a 
lawmaker whose party calls for expelling arabs from israel 
yair sprintzak 77 of the rightwing moledet homeland party 
administered the oaths under a law that makes the oldest member of 
the knesset or parliament its acting speaker until a permanent 
speaker is chosen 
a new speaker was chosen after the swearingin ceremony he is 
dov shilansky of the rightist likud bloc 
moledet which won two seats in the nov 1 elections calls for 
the voluntary transfer of palestinians from israels occupied 
territories 
before swearing in the new legislators sprintzak delivered a 
highly political speech in which he called for a greater israel a 
concept under which the occupied west bank and gaza strip would 
become part of israel 
more than a dozen leftwing legislators shouting words of 
protest got up from their seats and walked to the back of the hall 
they returned when sprintzak called the names of each knesset 
member but then 15 members refused to take the required oath 
we will not be sworn in by a transferist who represents for us 
the complete opposite of law morality and justice jewish and 
human for which we were elected said ran cohen of the leftist 
citizens rights movement 
five members of his faction were among those refusing to be sworn 
in by sprintzak others included avraham burg of the leftleaning 
labor party 
new parliament members cannot participate in proceedings until 
they take the oath said parliament spokeswoman sarah yitzhaki 
moledets platform calls for bringing about the voluntary 
transfer of 15 million palestinians from the occupied west bank 
and gaza strip through government policies that would deny arabs 
employment and other services 
sprintzak has been quoting as saying he is not a racist and 
advocates the transfer as the most humane solution to the 
israelipalestinian conflict 
the election of shilansky as new parliament speaker was also 
controversial shilansky has said he will refuse to meet with a 
german delegation if elected 
i dov shilansky am a holocaust survivor and i have to be 
loyal to my brothers i will not shake a germans hand even if i 
wanted to i could not do it he said 
the 64yearold lithuanianborn shilansky was sentenced to 21 
months in jail in 1952 for carrying explosives during a 
demonstration against israels reparation talks with west germany 
he was released after 16 months in jail

archbishop arturo rivera damas 
called for an investigation into the deaths of three farm workers 
killed during last weeks meeting of the organization of american 
states 
rivera damas said sunday that in addition to the three deaths in 
the eastern province of morazan 20 people were killed in combat 
during the conference in san salvador 
the prelate gave no details of the civilian slayings which had 
not been reported previously 
the information available involved national army troops in this 
action and we consider a detailed investigation necessary the 
archbishop said in his homily 
we believe acts of this type make the public react negatively 
against whomever uses that method whether it be the armed forces or 
the guerrillas he said 
the five leftist guerrilla groups which have been fighting for 
nine years to overthrow the usbacked government declared a 
temporary truce during the sixday oas meeting that ended saturday 
 
rivera damas said the meeting of the washingtonbased 
organization left an atmosphere of hope for peace 
it has meant in a way a certain possibility of support in 
that it could stimulate a political solution to our conflict the 
church leader said 
more than 15000 people from churches and labor organizations 
marched through the main streets of the capital on nov 15 to urge 
rebel and government representatives to hold new peace talks 
this is reason for joy for those of us who believe in the 
possibility of promoting peace through nonviolent actions he 
said 
the church mediated the few meetings between the two sides in 
recent years the latest on oct 20 1987 in san salvador and has 
been critical of killings of civilians by both the left and the 
right 
an estimated 65000 people have died in the war the majority of 
them civilians

will retain attorney general dick thornburgh saying the justice 
department chief has a record of unquestioned integrity and a 
commitment to upholding the highest ethical standards

because i know that he will work with me to fight drugs with every 
tool at our disposal and on other issues as well including 
attacking crime at every level and defending the civil rights of 
all americans

he succeeded edwin meese iii who resigned at the conclusion of a

remain but that there is something to be said for 
reinvigorating the process by with new people

tropical storm keith nudged past mexicos yucatan 
peninsula and buffeted cuba with its 65 mph winds early today on a 
curving track that forecasters expected would hit florida later in 
the week 
the lateseason caribbean depression grew into the 11th tropical 
storm of the season off mexico sunday morning and forecasters 
expected it to reach hurricane strength as it headed into the gulf 
of mexico 
at 11 am est the storm was located about 100 miles north of 
cancun mexico near latitude 225 north longitude 87 west 
forecasters say they expect it to continue to move north at 12 mph 
cancun a popular resort city was buffeted by hurricane gilbert two 
months ago 
heavy showers and thunderstorms continue over western cuba and 
may affect the lower keys and southwest florida later today and 
tonight said national weather service forecaster gil clark but 
the center of keith is expected to remain over the south central 
gulf of mexico for the next day or two 
the goverment of mexico issued a tropical storm warning and a 
hurricane watch for the northern yucatan peninsula and storm 
conditions were expected to spread over western cuba today rainfall 
totals of 5 to 10 inches were possible along the path of the storm 
forecasters said 
people living in lowlying areas of cancun were evacuated sunday 
afternoon mexicos excelsior news service said it was unknown how 
many left their homes for public shelters 
however many homes badly damaged by gilbert in september 
remained unoccupied excelsior said flood waters were 3feet deep in 
some areas 
for much of sunday forecasters worried that keith could race to 
southwest florida with hurricaneforce winds of 75 to 80 mph by 
tuesday morning but keith lingered off cozumel mexico as its 
steering currents weakened 
its going to head in this general direction as it turns north 
or northeast hurricane center meteorologist martin nelson said 
late sunday but in 72 hours wed still have it in the gulf of 
mexico somewhere west of key west 
the coral gables forecasting center predicted the highest 
probability a 1in7 chance of the storm hitting the gulf coast 
south of fort myers by 7 pm wednesday keith then was expected to 
cross the florida peninsula and head into the atlantic ocean 
it should be at minimal hurricane strength when it hits 
florida said jim lushine of the national hurrican center 
anywhere from the florida keys to the tampa area looks like thats 
the major area of concern 
tropical depressions become tropical storms once their top 
sustained winds reach 39 mph and tropical storms become hurricanes 
at 74 mph 
the system passed south of jamaica as a depression late friday 
and early saturday drenching kingston with nearly 4 inches of rain 
in 24 hours 
the atlantic hurricane season begins june 1 and ends nov 30 
with storm activity usually peaking in midseptember the season has 
spawned two major hurricanes gilbert which devestated jamaica and 
parts of mexico and joan which killed scores of people in northern 
south america and central america

a consumer group advising americans to be on 
the lookout for potential hazards as they shop for childrens 
christmas gifts today cited baby walkers and crib gyms as products 
that cause particular concern 
the consumer affairs committee of americans for democratic action 
said in its annual toy quality and safety report that baby walkers 
which can tip over or topple down stairs are highly dangerous 
and led to 20790 child injury reports to the consumer product 
safety commission in 1987 
crib gyms have caused 674 reported injuries since 1984 and 12 
deaths the committee said while most manufacturers now include 
voluntary warning labels that recommend removal of the gym toys when 
a baby can pull itself up to its hands and knees many carry no such 
warning it said 
warnings arent enough the committee said crib gyms need 
to be designed in the first place without hazards babies begin to 
enjoy crib gyms just at the age that parents are advised to remove 
them so human nature enters the picture and parents leave the crib 
gyms a little longer 
overall the committee said toys resulted in 131000 injuries in 
1987 105000 of them to children under age 15 
the committee said categories of potentially dangerous toys 
include 
some seasonal toys such as inflatable sleds that throw up snow 
which could blind the driver 
flammable items including stuffed animals that burn 
toys that teach children to imitate adults in a dangerous 
fashion such as an electric oven that could burn a child and a play 
iron with a realisticlooking plug that could send children to the 
nearest electrical socket 
toys that can be dangerous when broken for example a medical 
kit of poor construction that contains instruments which could break 
while a child puts them up to his face throat ears or eyes 
items that are dangerous for babies including rattles that 
dont meet specified width requirements which a baby could poke down 
its throat and choke on 
toys with inadequate or misleading age labels in some cases 
manufacturers may label a product containing small parts as for 
ages over 3 but the product nevertheless would be appealing to 
younger children 
the committee laid much of the blame for the abundance of 
dangerous toys on what it called the pitiful ineptitude of the 
federal consumer product safety commission it said the commission 
took just one major toyrelated action this year in banning lawn 
darts 
toy manufacturers aware they can virtually ignore the cpsc 
understand theres no one watching the store the committee said 
manufacturers seldom market dangerous toys willfully but bottom 
line considerations can obscure safety issues 
elaine tyrrell of the cpsc said it had not yet seen the report 
and thus would have no immediate comment on the criticisms of the 
agency she noted that the cpsc will soon issue its own report on 
safe and unsafe christmas toys 
the committee also said the toy industry experienced a shakeout 
in the wake of the october 1987 stock market crash that did not bode 
well for consumers 
the response of some toy manufacturers has been to fight a 
holding action suspending creative development and sticking with 
tried and true cheaper production methods and increased reliance 
on offshore production it said 
the committee offered several tips to use when shopping for safe 
fun and affordable toys including 
safety watch out for sharp edges small parts projectiles and 
potential danger if toy breaks toys that include fabric should say 
flame retardantflame resistant painted toys should be nontoxic 
buy the toy not the box examine the contents to make sure they 
are the same as whats pictured outside 
consider play value will the item offer enjoyment for a long 
time or lose its appeal after 15 minutes 
battery requirements take into account the added expense 
save sales receipts some stores will match the price of their 
competition 
save toy directions always read them avoid toys with 
overcomplicated ones 
potential mess consider how messy or destructive a toy will be 
check newspaper ads popular toys may go on sale just before 
christmas and be more readily available late in the season 
consider childs age good toys should not require constant 
supervision to ensure safety or correct use 
avoid hot items they may be cheaper next year and ads may 
be overglamorizing them

about 4000 ethnic albanians today 
defied threats of a crackdown on street demonstrations and marched 
to the capital of the restive province of kosovo pristina 
television said 
leaders of the republic of serbia renewed their campaign for more 
control of kosovo province following a wave of protests 
in the liberal northern republic of slovenia meanwhile an 
estimated 10000 people held a peaceful rally in driving snow to 
demand a referendum on controversial constitutional amendments 
pristina television said todays crowds marched from orohovac 40 
miles southwest of pristina to demand reinstatement of two ethnic 
albanian leaders who were forced to resign under serbian pressure 
last week 
police outside pristina shepherded the crowd as it passed through 
the predominatly serb suburb of kosovo polje the staterun tanjug 
news agency said no clashes between the rival groups were reported 
the demonstrations in the southern province of kosovo involving 
up to 100000 people last weekend have been the biggest there since 
world war ii the protesters have been angered by the forced 
resignations last thursday of azem vlasi and kacusa jasari two 
ethnic albanians from kosovos 13member ruling politburo 
the provincial party leadership has promised to review the 
resignations of vlasi and jasari at a meeting later this week 
asked why the the protesters had decided to defy warnings from 
numerous communist party leaders against more protests student 
skelzen malici said we are aware of this but we intend to 
continue coming here until the two leaders are reinstated 
serbian communist leader slobodan milosevic who has led the 
campaign for more serbian control of kosovo appeared to reject 
protesters demands that the two ethnic albanian leaders be 
reinstated 
in a speech to serbian communist leaders in belgrade milosevic 
made no direct reference to the kosovo protests but said ethnic 
albanian youths who made up the majority of the protesters are 
victims of indoctrination 
the ideologues of counterrevolution should be held responsible 
and not those who are just their arm he addded 
he said that restoring serbian control over the judiciary 
schools and policing of kosovo to stop alleged harassment of the 
slav minority are a precondition for serbian unity 
milosevic said in his speech today that about 500 ethnic 
albanians who have been jailed on charges of fomenting 
counterrevolution with alleged nationalism should be freed 
we should let these people out of jail and jail those who are 
really responsible for the genocide and terror he said 
milosevic and his supporters commonly use terms such as 
genocide and terror when talking about the alleged harassment of 
kosovos serb and montenegrin minorities by ethnic albanians 
official statistics show little if any evidence of ethnically 
motivated murder or proof of frequently alleged rapes of serbian 
women by ethnic albanian men 
milosevics is campaigning for changes in the 1974 constitution 
that gave kosovo broad autonomy 
communist leaders in yugoslavias other five republics see the 
campaign as part of a drive to increase the influence of serbia the 
largest republic on the yugoslav federation 
but milosevic has said the changes would only put serbia on an 
equal footing with other republics which have no administrative 
provinces like serbias kosovo and vojvodina

presidentelect george bush announced today he 
will retain attorney general dick thornburgh and education secretary 
lauro f cavazos bringing to three the number of reagan holdovers 
in his cabinet 
bush also said he would nominate richard darman former white 
house aide and deputy treasury secretary to head the office of 
management and budget 
the presidentelect said that in all likelihood thornburgh 
cavazos and previously announced treasury secretary nicholas brady 
would be the only current cabinet members he would ask to remain in 
their posts all were recent appointments to president reagans 
cabinet and took office with bushs blessing 
in response to questions from reporters after his announcement 
bush rejected a general accounting office report that dismissed his 
flexible freeze proposal for cutting the budget deficit it said 
that tax increases as well as military and social security cuts 
would have to be considered 
im not going to change my view as to how we get this deficit 
down he said though he also said he was openminded and 
prepared to hear a range of recommendations 
i dont remember any republicans or democrats running on a 
pleaseraisemytaxes program he said i dont remember that 
on another subject bush said it would be premature for him to 
consider any specific proposals that might be put forth next month 
when soviet president mikhail gorbachev comes to the united states 
and meets with president reagan 
it will be president reagans meeting bush said ill be 
there as vice president of the united states and i expect theyll be 
aware theyre talking to the next president 
he said that in terms of specificity in terms of my committing 
a brand new administration to specifics in arms control or anything 
else im not going to do that 
bush emphasized the role that thornburgh would have in fighting 
drugs 
drugs are public enemy no 1 said the presidentelect he 
went on to say that thornburgh will work with me to fight drugs 
with every tool at our disposal 
bush noted that cavazos a former president of texas tech 
university is the first hispanic to hold a cabinet post but he 
added overriding is dr cavazos commitment to excellence in 
education bush had promised hispanic leaders that he would name a 
hispanic to his cabinet 
bush said his choice of darman underscores his determination to 
cut the budget deficit 
dick darman understands the numbers bush said dick darman 
will play a central role in that effort which will commence 
immediately when i assume office because he understands the 
government and the economy so well dick will make sure the bush 
administration hits the ground running 
the presidentelect denied he planned to meet thanksgiving 
weekend with his defeated democratic opponent gov michael dukakis 
of massachusetts but bush said he did want to meet at some 
point with dukakis 
i want to do it i dont want to have a lot of show business 
he said i want to hold out my hand and say the campaign is 
behind us 
cavazos was named to succeed william bennett in september 
thornburgh a former pennsylvania governor is a bush ally who took 
office last august 
thornburgh and cavazos will be the second and third members of 
the current reagan administration to remain on the job earlier 
bush said brady would keep his position bush also appointed former 
treasury secretary james a baker iii as his secretary of state 
after his announcements today bush met with former presidents 
ford and carter to hear the recommendations from a commission they 
headed concerning the new administration

the fishing was good no fish replied bush who spent 
several days in florida after the election 
it looks like you havent done anything all fall said ford 
the nations only other living expresident richard nixon was 
meeting nearby with vice presidentelect dan quayle 
bush asked by reporters what happened to the rumored appointment 
of stanford economist michael j boskin as chairman of the council 
of economic advisers replied nothing happened just dont 
believe all the leaks you read in the newspapers 
craig fuller codirector of the transition said we have a 
high regard for him were still working on the chairmans 
appointment 
boskin is a conservative economist and expert on the social 
security system he was a father of bushs flexible freeze idea 
to drive down the deficit 
the stock market has sagged and the value of the dollar has 
fallen since bush captured the white house on nov 8 many analysts 
fear that his notaxhike pledge will impede efforts to bring down 
the deficit now growing by 155 billion a year 
bush has said he takes the deficit seriously and will work with 
democrats in congress to forge a solution but he has shown no 
willingness to budge on the issue of taxes democrats meanwhile 
have said they wont take the political heat or a tax increase by 
themselves 
bush spent a quiet weekend out of the limelight attending church 
sunday jogging and conferring at home with gov john sununu of new 
hampshire his chosen chief of staff 
bush revealed last tuesday that he is keeping his friend nicholas 
f brady as treasury secretary he told reporters friday he was 
concentrating on naming the rest of his economic team before turning 
his attention to defense and national security posts 
in reagans second term darman was deputy to baker as treasury 
secretary both left the government when baker resigned in august to

the judge in the irancontra case said today 
the major charges against former presidential aide oliver l north 
and three codefendants boiled down to simple allegations of fraud 
i am not trying anything else its a fraud trial us 
district judge gerhard a gesell told one of norths lawyers john 
d cline during a hearing on defense motions to dismiss the central 
conspiracy charge in the case 
it is fraud in the sense that chief justice william howard 
taft and the supreme court thereafter have consistently applied to 
the conspiracy statute the judge said 
the defense supported friday by a justice department brief 
contends north and his three codefendants could not be prosecuted 
for obstructing congresss foreign affairs authority by running a 
secret armssupply network to the nicarguan rebels 
the 1924 decision written by taft held that defendants did not 
have to violate a particular law in order to be guilty of 
obstructing government or depriving it of honest service 
gesell also expressed puzzlement over defense contentions that 
the diversion of armssale profits to the rebels known as contras 
did not violate the socalled boland amendent restrictions on 
military aid 
i am having a difficult time understanding why it is necessary 
to decide what the boland amendment means the judge said 
the defense contends that the series of amendments enacted by 
congress to ban direct military aid by us intelligence agencies 
did not apply to the national security council where north was an 
aide until his dismissal two years ago 
the indictment clearly depends upon the application of the 
boland amendment to the national security council cline told 
gesell arguing that if it did then it was unconstitutional 
but gesell expressed concern over allegations that north and 
others falsely assured congress they were complying with the series 
of boland amendments 
is it your position that the executive branch can represent 
through its people that they are complying with a statute and at the 
same time be affirmatively knowingly disobeying it because the 
statute is unconstitutional 
that is not the position i am taking cline said 
are you saying the president of the united states affirmatively 
intended to skim off the profits of the enterprise and use them to 
buy arms in nicaragua the judge asked later 
when cline demurred again the judge said the defense argument 
seems like jello it doesnt have anything i can pick up with my 
hands 
norths appearance today in court was his first since gesell said 
the former presidential aide was cynically trying to place himself 
above law 
in a written opinion gesell harshly criticized north for arguing 
that he couldnt be prosecuted for lying to thenattorney general 
edwin meese iii or destroying documents during the 1986 presidential 
investigation of the irancontra affair 
that opinion rejected an earlier attempt by north to have charges 
against him dismissed the judge said north fails to appreciate 
the gravity of his alleged conduct he added that the retired 
marine lieutenant colonels argument reveals a skewed attitude 
toward our constitutional form of government 
gesell already has rejected a number of defense motions to 
dismiss some of the 15 charges against north who is the irst of the 
four irancontra defendants set to be tried no date has been set 
for the trial 
north is accused of conspiring with former national security 
adviser john m poindexter arms dealer albert hakim and retired air 
force maj gen richard v secord to divert illegally usiran 
armssale profits to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
still pending are defense motions attacking the central 
conspiracy counts against north and his codefendants including 
arguments that the boland amendment which banned us military aid 
to the contras at the time did not apply to the national security 
council 
north also contends that the diversion of armssale profits 
wasnt illegal because the weapons were no longer us government 
property when they were sold to iran 
the defense argues that secord and hakim owned the weapons after 
purchasing them as middlemen in the armsforhostage deals 
the justice department lent support to norths defense on friday 
by challenging walshs contention that the defendants can be 
prosecuted for conspiring to defraud congress of its ability to 
oversee foreign affairs 
walsh contends the clandestine armssupply network to the 
nicaraguan rebels stymied congressional oversight of foreign policy 
and enforcement of the boland amendment 
but the justice department said the president not congress has 
the power to enforce laws it argued in a friendofthecourt brief 
that walsh ascribed to congress a toopowerful role in foreign 
affairs 
because of the doctrine of executive privilege and the 
presidents inherent foreign affairs authority congress authority 
to compel disclosure of information concerning covert activity is 
necessarily subject to formidable constitutional limitations 
nor can congress prohibit the president and his subordinates 
from exercising the presidents authority to engage in diplomacy or 
to exercise covert influence in the realm of external affairs the 
department said 
assistant attorneys general edward sg dennis jr of the 
criminal division and douglas w kmiec head of the office of legal 
counsel said the department was not arguing for or against 
dismissal of the central conspiracy count 
but dennis conceded that adoption of the departments arguments 
might narrow the scope of the charge

thousands of lithuanians chanting for shame 
jammed the center of their capital vilnius today to protest their 
legislatures refusal to declare the sovutonomy from 
moscow residents said 
in moscow lawmakers recommended changes in constitutional 
amendments that have touched off the furor in lithuania and the 
other baltic republics iet republics aestonia and latvia because of 
limits they 
place on the republics powers the daily pravda said 
the amendments were proposed by soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev as the keystone of his political reform program which 
includes the creation of a more powerful presidency and a fulltime 
national legislature 
in vilnuis the lithuanian movement for perestroikas call for a 
10minute noon protest halted traffic in the city center and about 
10000 people rallied on the citys gediminas square said movement 
spokeswoman rita dapkus 
alvydas medalinskas the movements acting secretary addressed 
the crowd from a balcony and called for the removal of three members 
of lithuanias communist party central coithuanian words meaning for 
shame for shame to criticize the 
inaction of their republics lawmakers ms dapkus said 
medalinskas told the crowd that what happened on friday was 
detrimental not only to the lithuanian perestroika movement but 
to all of lithuania she said 
the grassroots movement has called for another meeting of 
lithuanias supreme soviet by nov 29 and is collecting signatures 
on petitions that call for such a session 
what ms dapkus called a symbolic strike was to last for 10 
minutes throughout lithuania she said traffic had come to a 
standstill in vilnius but there was no word yet from lithuanias 
other cities 
police in central vilnius took no steps to interfere with the 
rally on gediminas square she said 
ms dapkus who is from chicago said she will be leaving the 
soviet union this week to set up an information bureau for the 
lithuanian movement in the united states 
pravda said today that a commission of the supreme soviet had 
recommended modifications in amendments to the constitution that 
were proposed by gorbachev and the national leadership as an 
apparent attempt to placate the baltic republics 
as originally written the amendment to article 108 authorizes a 
newly created council of peoples deputies to take decisions 
relative to the composition of the ussr the approval of the 
formation of new autonomous republics and autonomous regions in the 
composition of the union republics 
the commission recommended that article be changed to limit the 
council to questions of nationalstate structure relative to the 
jurisdiction of the ussr 
article 108 also authorized the council to annul legislation and 
acts of the soviet republics if they contradict the constitution 
the commission which met saturday recommended that such language 
be stricken as part of an effort to increase the development of 
the sovereign rights of the republics pravda said 
however the lawmakers also condemned the action of the estonian 
supreme soviet saying its decision on wednesday to give local laws 
primacy over soviet legislation was at odds with the 1977 soviet 
constitution 
their ruling was transmitted to the supreme soviet presidium the 
nations highest executive body possibly presaging a striking down 
of the estonian decision by the kremlin leadership 
estonia lithuania and the third baltic republic latvia were 
independent after the 1917 bolshevik revolution until 1940 when 
they were annexed by the soviet union 
the small westwardlooking republics have used president mikhail 
s gorbachevs political reforms dubbed perestroika to push 
for greater economic and cultural autonomy 
baltic residents contend that proposed amendments to the soviet 
constitution will limit their autonomy

chicago must hold a mayoral election 
next year to fill the two years remaining of the term of the late 
mayor harold washington the illinois supreme court ruled today 
the high court ruled without dissent it said that a reading of 
state election law along with the state law governing 
municipalities requires that a special election be held to fill a 
vacancy that occurs with more than 28 months left on a fouryear 
term 
washington the citys first black mayor died of a heart attack 
nov 25 1987 with 3 years left of his second term 
the scheme recognizes the importance of the voters not to have 
a mayoral appointee who is not of their own choosing for more than 
28 months justice joseph cunningham wrote in the courts opinion 
a lower court ruling already has called for a primary feb 28 
followed by a general election april 4 
the decision was eagerly awaited by a crowded field of announced 
and unannounced mayoral candidates unannounced candidates include 
the incumbent acting mayor eugene sawyer and front runner richard 
m daley who were both said to be awaiting the ruling before 
announcing neither had any immediate comment after the ruling was 
handed down today 
daley son of the late mayor richard j daley who died in 1976 
just won a landslide reelection as cook county states attorney and 
was the leader in a recent poll of potential mayoral contenders 
thats no surprise i never had any doubt that it would be 
1989 said democratic alderman edward burke who has already 
announced his candidacy we of course would have preferred that 
the question would have been cleared up a lot earlier 
sawyer who is black was appointed acting mayor a year ago by a 
bitterly divided city council after receiving the support of 
washingtons white council opponents he has trailed in the mayoral 
polls to another black democrat alderman tim evans who has claimed 
to be washingtons true political heir 
in chicago a strongly democratic town where no republican has 
been mayor for more than a halfcentury the primary is considered 
decisive many observers have said that if evans and sawyer split 
the black vote in the february primary and other white candidates 
step aside it could pave the way for a victory by daley the citys 
population is 40 percent black 
sawyer 54 had supported the 1991 date but has said repeatedly 
he is prepared to run a campaign immediately 
though daley 46 has declined to say whether he will run close 
associates have been quoted as saying they expect him to make a bid 
there are three other white candidates who have already announced 
but two of them are considered likely to pull out if daley runs 
daley lost to washington in a threeway democratic primary in 
1983 when he and incumbent mayor jane byrne split the white vote 
evans today called the ruling a great victory for the people 
of chicago 
candidate lawrence bloom the white liberal alderman who was a 
staunch washington ally agreed 
i think its the decision the public wanted they didnt want 
29 members of the city council to elect their mayor for three 
years said bloom he is not considered to be much of a factor in 
the race but insists hes in it to the end

conference today with top appointees to george bushs new 
administration on hand and newly renamed cabinet members on the way 
the transition happening in washington is actually happening 
right here said delaware gov michael n castle chairman of the 
conference 
twenty of the nations 23 republican governors along with two 
governorselect were on hand for opening ceremonies with all 
holding hand on heart for the pledge of allegiance and national 
anthem 
the formal opening occurred after presidentelect bush said he 
would retain attorney general dick thornburgh and education 
secretary lauro f cavazos in their cabinet posts in the new 
republican adinistration 
thornburgh and cavazos both were on the governors conference 
program today along with gov john sununu of new hampshire whom 
bush recently named as his new chief of staff and former bush 
campaign manager lee atwater whom bush has recommended to be 
chairman of the republican national committee 
the presidentelect is to meet with the governors tuesday 
castle said the lineup of influential bush staff members and the 
presidentelect put the conference as much in the forefront of 
changing events as any such meeting could be 
i think this administration in washington is going to be even 
more sensitive to the states said missouri gov john ashcroft 
castle and ashcroft commented sunday aboard the uss lexington 
an aircraft carrier docked off pensacola fla nine of the gop 
governors put on flight helmets and flew by jet to the carrier for a 
tour 
before the conference being held at the grand hotel resort on 
mobile bay most of the republican governors made clear they support 
bush on major domestic issues including his pledge against new 
taxes 
i think right now would be an inappropriate time to talk about 
new taxes said new mexico gov garrey carruthers 
if he believes he can do without taxes i am going to support 
him said florida gov bob martinez who did not plan to attend 
the conference because of a legislative session his and carruthers 
comments were made in interviews before the start of the forum 
castle said the conference this year was unique in that a new 
administration was coming into power and the presidentelect planned 
to attend along with influential members of the new administration 
we will be able to lay out some of our priorities he said 
ashcroft added we want to develop an even better dialogue with 
the presidentelect 
alabama gov guy hunt the host of the conference was one of the 
few governors who said bush may yet switch from his notax stand he 
said bush may support an increase in taxes if necessary after you 
cut all the waste you possibly could 
but he said not having looked at the books on the national 
level i really couldnt answer the question 
castle said he opposed more taxes emphasizing that initiatives 
being taken at the state level are helping to reduce longrange 
government problems and costs 
welfare reform demonstrated the states ability to put forward 
a workable solution to a complicated problem one that will save a 
great deal of money in the long run by helping people get off 
welfare he said 
in virtually every area where the federal government mandates 
programs i believe the states can do a better job in running 
them castle said

lack of public accountability and an 
inefficient bureaucracy have created a nightmare of sinking ships 
rebels who escape from birthday parties and foodstocks that vanish 
some problems which have beset the philippines recently can be 
explained by bad luck including three tropical storms that killed 
more than 600 people in two weeks 
but others appear the result of appalling lack of organization 
resources and efficiency in president corazon aquinos 
administration lack of public accountability contributes to an 
atmosphere where accidents wait to happen 
that in turn may be undermining public confidence in government 
a recent survey by ateneo university of 1200 people nationwide 
found just 31 percent expected their lives to improve fortytwo 
percent expected conditions to remain the same and 17 percent said 
they would get worse 
it is not enough that the president sets the example wrote 
the philippine daily inquirer on the issue of accountability she 
should also find the strength and conviction to make examples of 
officials who do not measure up 
on nov 12 the alleged chief of the communist rebel army 
escaped the military says romulo kintanar 41 and his wife gloria 
38 walked away from a birthday party for the former stockade 
commandant 
acting stockade commander maj benjamin landrito offered as an 
excuse that he was asleep in his office at the time 
it was not the first security breach at the stockade 
kintanars host lt col robelito comilang was suspended last 
month when a rightwing officer jailed for a leading role in an 
august 1987 coup attempt reportedly walked through three doors that 
were supposed to be locked climbed the stockade wall and was 
fatally shot by guards 
mrs aquino today blamed the six military coup attempts that 
rocked her administration on her efforts to seek rapproachment with 
communist rebels during a 60day ceasefire that expired in february 
1987 
the rightwing fringe of the military launched a succession 
of destabilizing attempts to topple me from power she said the 
assassination of leftist leaders discredited my commitment to human 
rights 
in june dozens of armed men tried to free former gov orlando 
dulay jailed in the 1986 deaths of several aquino supporters 
raiders failed to free dulay but made off with armory weapons 
mrs aquino has demanded a full investigation into kintanars 
escape three senior officers including landrito and comilang have 
been relieved and restricted to quarters 
but there is widespread skepticism about change 
there has not been any real investigation much less real 
punishment of people concerned fumed sen ernesto maceda 
chairman of the senate defense committee there is a tendency to 
cover up in the spirit of comradeship they just cover up the 
incident to control the damage 
macedas doubts were based on the failure of previous 
investigations to fix responsibility punish those at fault and 
implement changes 
commissions failed to solve the september 1986 assassination of 
labor leader rolando olalia the august killing of local governments 
secretary jaime ferrer and the september 1987 slaying of leftist 
leader lean alejandro 
another commission organized after the january 1987 killing of 13 
land reform protesters by soldiers guarding the presidential palace 
never established who gave the order to fire 
the senior officer on duty at the time brig gen ramon montano 
was furloughed as capital regional commander during the probe but 
months later he was promoted to major general and given command of 
the national police 
three separate commissions investigated the december 1987 
collision of the passenger ship dona paz with the oil tanker in 
which more than 3000 people were believed to have perished 
all three found evidence of widespread inefficiency in the 
maritime industry including overloaded ships lack of adequate 
communications poorly trained crew and the absence of effective 
search and rescue procedures 
but commodore carlito cunanan who as coast guard commandant was 
responsible for maritime safety was promoted to navy commander 
after the dona paz disaster 
last month the dona marilyn another passenger ship owned by the 
same company sailed into typhoon ruby and sank with 500 people 
aboard about half of whom remain missing and feared dead 
although the investigations into the second sinking have not been 
completed officials say they have found evidence of many of the 
same shortcomings which led to the dona paz disaster 
the country is one big dona marilyn sinking in the middle of a 
storm while the captain snores on top of a mahjong table wrote 
columnist francisco tatad many heads should roll 
lack of accountability has not been limited to the military in 
september mrs aquino fired emil ong as chairman of the national 
food authority after two investigating committees found evidence of 
widespread incompetence 
they cited among other things the disappearance of 350000 
worth of rice which ong said sank on three barges the coast guard 
had no record of the sinking 
ong was furloughed during the investigations then fired two 
days after he was dismissed for incompetence ong was named 
presidential adviser for regional government affairs 
also in september retired maj gen cesar tapia quit as security 
chief of manilas international airport claiming he was powerless 
to stop rampant corruption there despite his allegations most 
customs and immigration officials remain on the job there

the suspension of the soviet troop pullout from 
afghanistan is a worrisome move that could endanger a general 
worldwide trend toward detente an official magazine said monday 
the various flashpoints in the world are interrelated in one 
way or another the weekly beijing review said in an editorial 
it was precisely the signing of the geneva accords on the 
afghan question in april that led to dialogues and negotiations on 
many other regional issues contributing to the general trend 
towards relaxation in international relations the magazine said 
the suspension of the soviet troop withdrawal announced nov 4 
could weaken or even reverse the general trend toward detente 
it said 
the editorial did not mention any specific examples but it may 
have been referring in part to improvements in chinesesoviet 
relations in recent months the two countries split bitterly in the 
1960s over ideological and strategic differences and china has 
refused to normalize relations until the soviets remove their troops 
from afghanistan 
the soviet union sent troops there in 1979 to help replace one 
marxist leader with another and has kept them since to battle 
antimarxist afghan guerrillas 
the soviet union partially met another chinese demand to reduce 
its troop presence on the chinese border the third demand is to 
pressure its ally vietnam to withdraw from cambodia 
chinese leaders comments on the prospects for better relations 
with moscow have been more positive since the soviets began their 
troop pullout from afghanistan on may 15 foreign minister qian 
qichen goes to moscow next month in the first working visit there by 
a chinese foreign minister since 1956 
senior leader deng xiaoping said recently that a chinesesoviet 
summit could be held as early as next year 
in suspending its pullout from afghanistan the soviet union 
blamed increased attacks by the afghan guerrillas 
but the beijing review said the move raised doubts about 
whether the soviets are going to live up to the geneva agreement 
the soviet union should implement the agreement in earnest 
and withdraw all its military forces from afghanistan as 
scheduled it said it should not look for any pretexts to 
delay

newfoundland voters today cast the first ballots 
in national elections prime minister brian mulroney hopes will give 
him a parliamentary majority to ratify the uscanada free trade 
agreement 
the controversial trade pact which has dominated the rancorous 
campaign would phase out all remaining tariffs on trade between the 
two countries starting jan 1 
polls opened at 9 am beginning with the atlantic coast 
province of newfoundland which is in a time zone 90 minutes ahead 
of eastern standard time polls close at 8 pm 
canadian evening television coverage was scheduled to start at 8 
pm est canadian television is delaying its coverage to western 
time zones so that voters can go the polls without knowing early 
results 
british columbia on the pacific coast where polls close at 11 
pm est could be decisive in any close race 
opposition leader john turner has urged canadians to vote for his 
liberal party because he opposes the trade agreement and is seeking 
to keep canada canadian 
turner revived his partys chances during the 51day campaign by 
accusing mulroney of selling out canada 
mulroney 49 in turn charged turner with usingscare tactics 
including allegations the pact would wreck social programs and cost 
many canadians their jobs mulroney brought out his mother to show 
his committment to retirement benefits 
mulroney voted in his home town of baiecomeau quebec where he 
told reporters he planned to spend the day walking in the snow and 
getting out the vote 
new democratic party leader ed broadbent was in his home town of 
oshawa an auto center in ontario east of toronto while turner was 
the last to vote because of the pacific coastal time in his 
vancouver british columbia home district 
polls in the campaigns final days showed mulroneys progressive 
conservative party had returned to favor after a twomonth slide 
attributed to the effectiveness of the 59yearold turners attacks 
the opinion surveys showed the governing conservatives in good 
position to win a slim majority of the 295 seats in the house of 
commons which would allow the canadian parliamentarians to ratify 
the 10year trade pact 
the leader who can muster a majority of at least 148 seats 
controls the government 
the socialist new democratic party also opposes the free trade 
agreement and could play a decisive role in any close outcome 
a poll saturday by gallup canada indicated the conservatives had 
the support of 40 percent of the decided respondents the liberals 
35 percent and the new democrats 22 percent 
turnout among canadas 175 million eligible voters was expected 
to be higher than the 1984 elections when about one in four didnt 
show up 
if successful mulroney could become the first canadian prime 
minister to win successive majority governments since 1953 the 
liberals were ousted in a 1984 landslide spearheaded by mulroney 
decisive results could be determined in the countrys most 
populous provinces quebec and ontario after polls close there at 8 
pm est but results may not be known until late at night because 
of polls closing in alberta and british columbia 
support for the agreement is strong in frenchspeaking quebec 
and opposition runs high in englishspeaking ontario 
mulroney has asked for another term this time not only to go 
ahead with the free trade agreement but to extend economic policies 
he credited with creating 13 million jobs canada like its more 
populous southern neighbor is in the sixth year of an economic boom 
mulroney maintains the trade pact he signed with president reagan 
guarantees future canadian prosperity by assuring access to the much 
larger us market the two countries have about 150 billion in 
annual trade 
advocates of the trade deal see a huge north american 
marketplace with entrepeneurs on both sides of the border enjoying 
equal competitive access 
the liberals who have played a dominant role in canadian 
politics for much of this century appeared in trouble at the outset 
of the campaign with some predicting they could sink to third place 
behind the new democrats 
but turner revived the partys chances with a strong 
nationalistic attack on the free trade agreement calling it a bad 
deal for canada he accused mulroney of selling out the worlds 
secondlargest country and tapped into powerful currents of 
nationalism dating to canadas founding 121 years ago 
the liberal leader who served as prime minister for 79 days in 
1984 argued that canadas 26 million people would be overwhelmed by 
the larger population of 245 million and vastly greater economic 
power of the united states 
free trade came to overshadow all other issues in a campaign that 
generated an unusual amount of interest throughout canada as well as 
abroad 
the trade pact approved by the us congress needs final 
canadian parliamentary approval

miodowicz first proposed a tv debate with walesa in an interview 
in the communist party newspaper trybuna ludu on nov 15 
walesa promptly accepted miodowiczs challenge saying he had 
long sought a debate with miodowicz who has headed the official 
unions since they were set up by the government in 1982 after it 
banned solidarity the soviet blocs first independent trade union 
trade union pluralism will be the main issue discussed during the 
debate solidarity and the opzz hold opposing views on the number 
and organization of trade unions within factories and on the shop 
floor 
an opzz official said the union was prepared for a meeting with 
the solidarity advisers to discuss the debates technical details 
as far as i know if the representatives of walesas side will 
come to us directly if it concerns only technical details i think 
we can hold such a meeting said opzz deputy chairman jerzy 
uzieblo 
uzieblo said there will be no moderator although other issues 
still must be worked out

carlos salinas de gortari presidentelect of 
mexico hopes his meeting tuesday with george bush will establish a 
personal bond and set the pattern for usmexican relations 
his task will not be easy given the mexican view that its 
powerful neighbor constantly tries to impose its political and 
economic will south of the border but salinas advisers hope he and 
the us presidentelect will form the basis for a working 
relationsship 
salinas a harvardeducated economist who takes office dec 1 
will meet bush for three hours tuesday in houston 
both bush and salinas are men with open minds who are willing 
to listen to the interests and concerns of others we have different 
problems and common interests said juan enriquez a former 
harvard university professor who works in the mexicos governing 
revolutionary institutional party known by its spanish initials pri 
as salinas sees it mexico must resume economic growth and cannot 
do so without reducing the burden of payments on its 102 billion 
foreign debt which drain economic resources and leave little money 
for development 
some mexicans fear bush and the us government may see drug 
trafficking as the main bilateral problem and try to blame mexico 
for letting drugs into the united states 
the governments have managed to work out temporary or partial 
solutions to other problems including water contamination along the 
border and access to us markets for mexican products 
even foreign policy disagreements over central america have been 
played down in recent years 
victor hugo celaya a mexican congressman who is president of the 
border commission said the united states is becoming more aware 
of our economic realities the united states must reexamine its 
policies in the region or it will risk the chance of being isolated 
geopolitically 
he said the houston meeting underlines the need to resume and 
expand our dialogue and start the two new administrations with 
common points of view and programs for collaboration and 
development 
outgoing president miguel de la madrid had six meetings with 
president reagan marked by us demands often irritating to mexico 
that it do more to fight drug trafficking 
our relations with the united states have always been 
difficult so difficult that we lost half of our territory last 
century de la madrid said in an interview last month nowadays 
it is a challenge for mexico to live next to the biggest richest 
and most complex country in the world 
mexican foreign policy is often at odds with that of the united 
states especially in central america and mexicans feel us 
government officials do not understand their culture and politics 
well enough 
mexico is an easy target for us officials who complain of 
corruption and failure to stop the drug trafficig drug trafficking 
the mexicans say they do the best they can with limited resources 
at his final meeting with reagan last february de la madrid 
said bluntly the best way to fight the drugs was for citizens of the 
united states to stop using them

us customs service inspectors seized more 
than 1400 pounds of highgrade cocaine with an estimated street 
value of 28 million the customs service said monday 
the cocaine was found nov 11 in suburban jefferson in a shipment 
of 55gallon drums of resin from guatemala but announcement of the 
confiscation was delayed because customs wanted to try to catch the 
buyers said spokeswoman liz orgeron 
what we were trying to do was make a controlled delivery to see 
if we could make an arrest said orgeron 
she said that was done last week but no arrests were made and 
the 1424 pounds of the drug was turned over to the drug enforcement 
administration 
the seizure was the largest ever in new orleans said orgeron 
she said the cocaine was on a ship that carried goods from 
central america a fact that prompted customs agents to look 
closely at the cargo the resin containers got special attention 
because resin rarely comes into the port of new orleans she said 
she said the customs contraband enforcement team drilled into 60 
drums of resin and found cocaine in 12 when those 12 drums were cut 
in half with acetylene torches inspectors found smaller 30gallon 
drums surrounded by layers of tar and each containing about 45 
onekilogram bricks of cocaine

sixtyeight mississippi inmates including 
convicted killers will head home for thanksgiving on tuesday as 
part of the states holiday furlough program 
a variety of criminals who have maintained good records and 
cleared a department of corrections screening will earn the 
furloughs said interim corrections commissioner charles jackson 
although no estimate of the total number of inmates heading home 
this year was available 68 are scheduled to depart tuesday jackson 
said holiday furloughs usually range from three to 10 days 
during the last holiday season 539 inmates were allowed out on 
furlough department of corrections spokesman ken jones said 
jackson who signs inmates passes said he strongly considered 
calling off the furloughs in the wake of a 3 million verdict 
against three former state parole board members 
the members who voted to release an inmate who later shot and 
paralyzed jackson bank executive linda grantham were found by a 
hinds county circuit court jury to be negligent in the case filed by 
ms grantham 
parole and holiday furloughs are separate programs but the 
precedent has been set for liability if an inmate on release injures 
someone jackson said 
we are going to have a christmas leave program this year as in 
the past but because of recent happenings we are going to be more 
strict on screening people and not going to go over it once but go 
over it twice to make sure we have covered every base jackson 
said 
state law allows the corrections commissioner to grant personal 
leave to certain inmates 
only trusty inmates are eligible for consideration they must 
have served a set minimum part of their sentences ranging from 
eight months on a oneyear sentence to at least four years of any 
sentence of 21 years to life jones said 
mississippi law specifically bars special leave for any person 
convicted of a sex crime jackson said while corrections department 
rules bar other inmates including those sentenced to terms without 
hope of parole

president saddam hussein said monday his 
eldest son odai bludgeoned to death a presidential bodyguard and 
he ordered an investigation into the slaying 
in a letter to the minister broadcast on state radio hussein 
said kamel hana gegeo was killed the night of oct 18 when the 
trusted bodyguard was firing his gun in a private villa near the 
presidential palace in baghdad 
he said odai sent his own bodyguard to ask gegeo to stop 
shooting but gegeo did not obey odai and his bodyguard went to see 
why gegeo disobeyed him as well as a presidential order that 
prohibits firing personal weapons during celebrations 
odai went to gegeo and asked him if he received his order to stop 
shooting and when the bodyguard said yes odai hit him with a wooden 
bat 
gegeo was rushed to a hospital where he died the next day from a 
head wound 
odai 25 is the oldest of the presidents five children 
in nicosia cyprus sources said the bodyguard was particularly 
close to the president and a distraught hussein accompanied gegeos 
body to a church for funeral preparations 
the guard believed to be in his 20s was the son of the 
presidents cook and the governess of his three daughters the 
sources said 
they detailed a different version of the killing circulating in 
baghdad with odai firing the gun and the bodyguard killed while 
trying to quiet him 
hussein said he investigated the murder and referred the case 
so that justice is done 
he said odai is in jail and has tried to commit suicide three 
times since gegeo died 
the president described his gegeo as a trusted person and a man 
who never disobeyed him 
he said his son had not committed such a crime before and 
described the murder as a will of god which cannot be prevented 
it is my constitutional responsibility to enforce justice in 
the society and that does not exempt anyone hussein said in 
his letter 
hussein ordered justice minister akram abdul qader douri to 
investigate the death

part of the soviet unions vast defense industry 
will be turning out plumbing parts for use in a crash program to 
build more housing a government official said monday 
yuri p batalin deputy chairman of the council of ministers or 
cabinet said the military has the facilities for manufacturing the 
items needed so defense plants will be put to work turning out the 
equipment 
this is happening because available capacities in the defense 
industry will be reoriented rather than producing armaments they 
will produce plumbing items batalin told a news briefing 
the involvement of the military in civilian housing programs is 
just one way soviets hope to tap various sources for increasing the 
countrys stock of construction equipment and supplies 
one city dweller in five lives in a dormitory or communal 
apartment shared with other families president mikhail s gorbachev 
has proclaimed the goal of building enough new housing so each 
soviet family can have its own apartment or house by the year 2000 
in february the government announced a plan for citizens to take 
out large bank loans to build private homes but even for the 
enterprising housing construction often is frustrated by lack of 
necessary materials 
the market resources will have to grow said yuri p boyev 
deputy soviet minister for material and technical supplies we 
will have to provide the market with the needed materials 
boyev said officials understand the shortage of supplies and are 
trying to speed up production of everything from plumbing parts to 
linoleum he said his department made 20000 square yards of 
linoleum in 1985 and expects to make 57000 square yards next year 
individual credits for housing construction are not new but had 
been issued on a limited basis until the announcement of the private 
loan program last year the government provided 720 million and in 
10 months of this year will have provided 28 billion batalin said 
private construction had been discouraged in official attempts to 
cut down on pilferage of hardtocomeby building materials from 
state enterprises 
batalin said recent changes to permit more economic autonomy in 
the countrys 15 constituent republics will create more of a 
marketplace atmosphere alleviating the shortages of materials 
na nazarbayev chairman of the council of ministers of 
kazakhstan one of five central asian republics said the exchange 
of goods between the republics had at times been arbitrary and 
unresponsive to needs 
for instance he said kazakhstan provides the baltic republic of 
estonia with grain and receives footwear in return when what 
kazakhstan really needs is timber which is plentiful in estonia 
nazarbayev said the selffinancing plan will permit the republics 
to barter or sell products directly for muchneeded supplies adding 
impetus to the housing construction program

more than 100 world leaders passed along 
greetings of peace monday in the 16th annual world hello day 
organized by two nebraska brothers 
president reagan and prince charles and princess diana were among 
the participants this year in the unofficial ritual designed to 
promote world peace with a series of simple hellos 
i guess when you get the heads of states of 100 countries 
together on anything you have really accomplished something 
cofounder michael mccormack said 
mccormack 36 was attending harvard university in 1973 when he 
and his brother brian 31 started world hello day in response to 
the growing tension in the middle east 
since then the annual event that involves greeting at least 10 
people in the name of peace has attracted international attention 
the brothers received letters of support this year from the 
leaders of 101 countries ranging from australia to zaire 
last week a letter arrived from the white house with a warm 
hello from reagan and on monday the brothers heard from the 
secretary general of the league of arab states 
others who have participated in world hello day include pope john 
paul ii mother teresa the late indian prime minister indira 
gandhi bishop desmond tutu solidarity leader lech walesa the late 
egyptian president anwar sadat costa rican president oscar arias 
sanchez queen elizabeth ii and former presidents gerald ford and 
jimmy carter 
mccormack said he has received thousands of letters this year 
from everyday people but it is the notes from famous leaders that 
draw the most attention 
the president of beijing university in china told me that one 
of the things world hello day does is mobilize people to act in a 
specific way to promote peace it gives them a taste of what it is 
like to participate in that process mccormack said 
letters have arrived from prince charles and princess diana 
olivia de havilland billy graham jim henson charlton heston lee 
iacocca richard leakey james a michener jack nicklaus arnold 
palmer luciano pavarotti stevie wonder and pele 
you talk about a grassroots movement that goes from the ground 
up mccormack said what we have done is work from the other 
direction from the crowns of the trees down to the roots people 
are interested when they say their own head of state has written a 
letter and supports world hello day 
mccormack who devotes all his time to the annual event said he 
doesnt have much interest in trying to gain official national 
status for world hello day in the united states 
i think what we would like to do is keep it a day that becomes 
a special day because people want to make it a special day on their 
own not because it is an official holiday he said

two university of delaware researchers have 
found that marble tombstones provide a unique record of air 
pollution that shows the cleanup efforts of the last two decades 
appear to be working 
by measuring the deterioration rates of about 2000 tombstones in 
cemeteries from newark to norristown pa geography professor 
thomas c meierding and graduate student johan feddema have produced 
an outline of air pollution history in the delaware valley 
the study found extensive differences in pollution levels between 
areas and suggests that pollutants that have nearly dissolved some 
headstones likely have extensively damaged other structures 
many tombstones in central philadelphia the hardesthit area in 
the study are so weakened from decades of sulfur dioxide deposits 
that they flex under slight pressure feddema said their 
surfaces are so disfigured from flaking that many inscriptions have 
disappeared 
in contrast tombstones examined in delaware cemeteries show less 
wear and those in areas with excellent air quality such as hawaii 
and rural nebraska show almost no deterioration 
the researchers surveyed tombstones placed between 1790 and 1840 
restricting their study for the most part to markers made from 
marble extracted from southeastern pennsylvania quarries they 
measured the base and tops of 30 tombstones in each cemetery and 
compiled an average weathering figure per cemetery 
the difference between the bases and the tops which were more 
exposed to the windborne pollutants showed the rate at which the 
stones deteriorated 
the researchers calculated the deterioration rate according to a 
100year scale and found that an urban tombstone may deteriorate at 
10 times the rate of a stone in a rural graveyard 
they also found that a distance of even a few miles from an 
industrial area can lead to markedly different pollution rates for 
example the destruction of tombstone faces by pollutants was as 
high as 47 percent in central philadelphia but only 2 percent in the 
nearby countryside 
because tombstones are widespread remain relatively untouched 
over time and are easily damaged by airborne pollutants they 
present a fairly simple gauge for air quality said meierding who 
has been awarded a national science foundation grant to survey 
pollution patterns in tombstones nationwide 
the researchers said the tombstones appear to have been most 
affected by gaseous sulfur dioxide which spurs the growth of gypsum 
crystals that cause marble to shed large flakes and lose strength 
however both feddema and meierding believe acid rain which can 
carry pollutants great distances has made only a slight 
contribution to the deterioration they point instead to local 
sources of pollution such as coalfired power plants steel mills 
and refineries 
the pioneering study reviewed last week during an environmental 
forum in newark also suggests 
the worst pollution damage occurred between the 1930s and 1960s 
sulfur dioxide damage to marble tombstones probably depicts the 
way air pollutants have damaged building materials like cement 
brick and metal 
air pollution controls to limit emissions installed in the last 
two decades appear to be working after 1970 rates of deterioration 
in tombstones seem to have improved reflecting the cleaner skies 
the comparison of tombstone damage may be used to compare the 
costs of pollution damage between regions if central philadelphia 
has suffered 10 times the pollution of newark costs associated with 
that pollution should be 10 times more in philadelphia he said

democratic rep robert garcia today became the 
second us congressman to be indicted in the wedtech corruption 
scandal 
a federal grand jury in manhattan indicted garcia a sixterm 
democrat his wife jane lee garcia and a san juan puerto rico 
attorney ralph vallone jr on briberelated conspiracy charges 
the indictment was released by the office of us attorney 
rudolph giuliani the prosecutor said today that the wedtech 
investigation is continuing 
garcia was the 18th person to be indicted in the past decade to 
be indicted on criminal charges while serving in congress 
garcia 55 a democrat from the south bronx easily turned away 
primary and general election challenges to win a sixth term earlier 
this month 
through his spokesman bill danvers garcia said he was innocent 
and vowed to fight the charges with all of my godgiven strength 
i am grateful that this period of trial by grand jury leaks is 
finally over the statement said he said the charges stemmed from 
the preposterous allegations of mario moreno one of the most 
notorious felons of the 20th century 
moreno was one of four wedtech officials who pleaded guilty to 
bribing government authorities and cooperated with prosecutors he 
had testified that garcia and his wife had received money and 
jewelry as bribes for their work on behalf of the now bankrupt 
defense contractor 
garcia who was born in new york was the second person of puerto 
rican descent to be elected to congress former rep herman badillo 
also of new york was the first 
on friday former us rep mario biaggi another bronx democrat 
was sentenced to eight years in prison for his part in the wedtech 
scandal 
he and several others were convicted in august of turning 
wedtech a nowdefunct defense contractor into a cash cow that 
produced millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks 
wedtech was a tiny south bronx machine shop that grew into a 
multimilliondollarayear defense contractor through a small 
business administration program that allowed minorityowned firms to 
obtain government contracts without competitive bidding 
but allegations of bribery influencepeddling and other 
wrongdoing enmeshed wedtech in a series of federal and state 
investigations that forced it into bankruptcy proceedings in 
december 1986 
to date at least 19 people caught up in the wedtech scandal have 
been convicted of crimes ranging from racketeering to illegal 
lobbying 
they include former white house aide lyn nofziger who was 
convicted of illegal lobbying and two former maryland state 
senators convicted of taking 50000 in bribes from wedtech 
two onetime associates of former us attorney general edwin 
meese iii have also been indicted on wedtechrelated racketeering 
charges and are scheduled to go on trial early next year meese was 
never indicted although a special prosecutor questioned the former 
attorney generals ethics after a lengthy investigation

the federal reserve board on monday proposed a 
rule imposing tighter restrictions on the ability of statechartered 
banks to acquire nonbanking subsidiaries 
the rule proposed by a 61 vote with board member martha seger 
dissenting would require that the approximately 7000 
statechartered banks owned by holding companies get the feds 
permission before estabishing real estate insurance and other 
nonbanking subsidiaries 
proponents of the rule say some states have moved aggressively to 
authorize new activities without regard for bank safety and 
soundness opponents say the federal reserve should not seek more 
power over state banks 
regulation y adopted in 1971 has allowed state banks to 
purchase nonbank firms without fed approval under the bank holding 
company act 
the change could be adopted in three to six months it would 
exempt nonbank businesses already owned by statechartered banks 
although federal reserve vice chairman manuel johnson asked the fed 
staff to solicit comment on the possibility of requiring divestiture 
of such activities 
a recent federal court ruling requires nationallychartered banks 
to receive federal reserve permission before acquiring a nonbank 
subsidiary the decision is being appealed and the federal reserves 
staff said it would propose rules for national banks later

a lawyer for confessed twa 
hijacker mohammed ali hamadi said monday his client was mentally ill 
and he asked the court to authorize a psychiatric examination 
also monday a former hostage fought back tears as he recalled 
offering to take his soninlaws place when the hijackers took 
several hostages off the plane in beirut 
chief judge heiner mueckenberger made no immediate ruling on 
lawyer hansburkhardt stecks request for a psychiatrist 
hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem is charged with murder and air 
piracy in the hijacking of twa flight 847 after it left athens for 
rome in june 1985 us navy diver robert stethem was killed and 39 
americans were held hostage for 17 days 
hamadi admits he was one of the hijackers but denies killing 
stethem 
steck said hamadi appears to be an adult in many things but is 
a child that had been hindered in his development 
he said hamadi was mentally disturbed at the time of the 
hijacking but had wanted a bloodless hijacking 
the mental and physical damage hamadi had suffered from 
fighting in lebanon should have an influence on the sentence 
while steck spoke the mother of the slain diver patricia 
stethem walked out of the courtroom apparently fighting back tears 
she and her husband richard have followed all 34 sessions since 
the trial opened july 5 
later american real estate developer vincente garza testified 
that his soninlaw robert trautmann was among several hostages 
taken off the plane at beirut airport and hidden in the city 
i thought he could be the first to be shot and i asked hamadi 
dont take him away take me hamadi just pushed me back said 
garza 57 his voice cracking with emotion 
another american testified that she feared the hijackers would 
harm her because she is jewish 
i heard screams and beatings on more than one occasion said 
mauri schwarz a 36yearold computer saleswoman i was very 
afraid because i am jewish and i didnt know if they knew it 
ms schwarz said she saw one passenger ask for medical help 
because he had a heart condition but the hijackers refused 
hamadi denied this when asked to comment 
if anyone had asked me for a doctor i would have done that 
he said 
the court monday completed crossexamining dr burton weber 
whose testimony was interrupted nov 15 when hamadi said he felt ill 
weber said hamadi appeared less wild and less mean than his 
accomplice hassan ezzeddine who is a fugitive 
he hamadi was not kind and nice and good but in my mind he 
was less frightening weber said 
under court guidelines to protect witnesses former hostages do 
not reveal their hometowns 
hamadi was arrested at frankfurt airport in 1987 after customs 
officials found liquid explosives in his luggage 
the united states requested his extradition last year but the 
west german government turned it down fearing for the lives of two 
west germans held hostage in lebanon the hostages since have been 
released 
hamadis older brother abbas is serving a 13year prison term 
in west germany in connection with the kidnappings

parents who go christmas shopping for their 
kids should beware there are more dangerous toys than ever before 
a consumer group warned monday 
while there are a variety of specific toys which are potentially 
harmful entire classes of toys baby walkers and crib gyms were 
singled out as dangerous by the consumers affairs committee of the 
americans for democratic action 
the 17th annual report of the private nonprofit organization 
also was critical of the consumer product safety commission the 
federal agency which oversees toys and other consumer goods 
a major reason for the abundance of dangerous toys is the 
pitiful ineptitude of the cpsc the report said 
elaine tyrrell a spokeswoman for the cpsc said the agency would 
not have any comment because it hadnt yet seen the report but she 
noted that the cpsc soon will issue its own set of christmas toy 
guidelines 
the report said dangerous and potentially dangerous toys are 
more available than ever this year our consumer group was inundated 
by potentially dangerous toys 
the report cited cpsc statistics which blamed toys for causing 
131000 injuries last year including 105000 to kids under 15 years 
old 
baby walkers can tip over or topple down stairs making them 
highly dangerous the report said the cpsc received 20790 
injury reports last year from baby walkers the group noted 
crib gyms have caused 12 deaths and 662 other injuries in the 
past five years the report said 
warnings arent enough crib gyms need to be designed in the 
first place without hazards the report said babies begin to 
enjoy crib gyms just at the age that parents are advised to remove 
them so human nature enters the picture and parents leave the crib 
gyms a little longer 
among the toys cited by the ada panel as potentially dangerous 
inflatable sleds some of which throw up snow that could blind 
the driver 
flammable items including stuffed animals 
householdtype toys urging children to imitate adults in a 
dangerous fashion the report cited an electric oven which could 
burn a kid and a toy iron that has a realisticlooking plug that 
could send children to the nearest electrical outlet 
items which could be dangerous if broken one example cited was 
a toy doctors kit which included realisticlooking plastic 
instruments that could break when a child puts them up to his face 
throat ears or eyes 
items dangerous for babies including rattles that dont meet 
specified width requirements a baby could choke on that rattle the 
report said 
toys with inadequate or misleading age labels in some 
instances manufacturers label a product containing small parts as 
for ages over 3 but it still appeals to younger kids 
parents who go toy shopping in the next month should keep several 
things in mind the report noted including 
safety look for sharp edges small parts projectiles and 
potential danger if the toy breaks toys with fabric in them should 
say the material is flame retardant or flame resistant painted toys 
should be nontoxic 
look at the toy not the box examine the contents to make sure 
it is the same as whats pictured outside 
consider the toys play value will the child enjoy it more than 
once or be bored after 15 minutes 
batteries few toys include batteries 
save sales receipts some stores will match the price of their 
competition 
read the directions avoid toys with instructions that are too 
complicated 
check newspaper ads popular toys may go on sale just before 
christmas and be more readily available late in the season 
consider the childs age good toys should not require constant 
supervision to ensure safety or correct use 
avoid hot items they might be cheaper next year and ads 
overglamorize them

alexander dubcek the former

of a world war ii massacre and condemned fascism as the enemy of 
democracy

he paused in silence in front of a monument honoring the 
czechoslovak village of lidice which was rebuilt after being razed 
by the nazis and is a sister city to marzabotto 
i am honored to be here in this place which testifies to what 
nazism meant dubcek said fascism is the enemy of democracy we

the illinois supreme court set the stage 
monday for chicagos third mayoral freeforall in six years ruling 
that voters must decide who serves the last two years of the late 
mayor harold washingtons term 
siding with city officials who scheduled a feb 28 primary and an 
april 4 general election next year rather than waiting until 1991 
the court said mayor eugene sawyers appointment by the city council 
after washingtons death does not extend through 1991 when 
washingtons term ends 
washington died of a heart attack on nov 25 1987 less than 
eight months after winning a second term 
the seven justices ruled without written dissent that state laws 
governing vacancies in office were designed to ensure that an 
appointed official would not serve such a long portion of an 
unexpired term 
supporters of a 1991 election had argued their case was supported 
by the state election code which says the mayor of chicago should 
be chosen in a spring election every four years beginning in 1979 
the court said that only prescribes regularly scheduled elections 
where the incumbent official continues in office 
sawyer who supported a 1991 election but has indicated he is 
prepared to run next year said he was pleased that this decision 
has been made and that the people in chicago are no longer in 
limbo 
we are ready for the upcoming election and look forward to 
winning it said sawyer who raised nearly 3 million in less than 
a year against the possibility of a spring election 
the ruling also drew applause from the field of announced and 
wouldbe candidates poised to make next years mayoral race the most 
crowded in the citys recent history 
i think its the decision the public wanted said alderman 
lawrence bloom a staunch washington ally who was among the first to 
announce his candidacy for a 1989 mayoral race they didnt want 
29 members of the city council to elect their mayor for three 
years 
cook county states attorney richard m daley widely reported to 
be planning a second bid for the job his father held for two 
decades said he would make an announcement in the next two 
weeks 
this is a serious decision daley said 
aldermen timothy evans and danny davis both considered leading 
contenders for washingtons mantle of black political leadership in 
chicago also praised the decision 
according to a recent chicago suntimesabc television poll 
daley is supported by 37 percent of all voters evans was second at 
22 percent sawyer third with 10 percent and bloom fourth with 9 
percent 
the remaining 22 percent was divided among the other announced 
candidates davis alderman edward burke former chicago parks 
district superintendent edmund kelly and undecided 
the possibility of three black candidates sawyer evans and 
davis raises the possibility of a split in the black voting bloc 
that made washington the citys first black mayor in 1983 and 
lifted him to reelection in 1987 
such a split would strengthen daley who split the white vote 
with former mayor jane byrne in a 1983 democratic primary and thus 
helped washington move into the general election in which democrats 
historically have been prohibitive favorites no republican has been 
chicagos mayor for more than half a century 
mondays court ruling came in a suit filed in april by evans 
supporters who sought the early election in an effort to deny 
sawyer time to consolidate his power

sponsors of a library documenting the 
reagan presidency have had to steer around a variety of pitfalls 
from liberal stanford university professors to a rare sixinch 
sunflower 
groundbreaking here monday for the ronald reagan presidential 
library was made possible by a compromise with environmentalists 
that protects the sunflower and two other rare plants 
before that the ronald reagan foundation had to overcome 
concerns that the project would detract from a section of rolling 
coastal mountain range set aside by local planners as a protected 
area 
and all that came after the foundation abandoned its original 
plans to construct the library on a 20acre northern california site 
at stanford in conjunction with a proposed policy center 
neighbors of the university had complained about expected tourist 
traffic while liberal professors didnt want the campus used to 
enshrine the memory of a conservative champion 
stanfords trustees split the library from the proposed policy 
center in 1984 but planning for the library continued into 1987 up 
to the point that blueprints were unveiled with fanfare in 
washington 
in april 1987 the foundation canceled its stanford plans 
publicly citing the separation three years earlier of the library 
from the policy center 
in the ensuing months a number of potential sites in southern 
california were rumored to be under consideration including the 
university of california riverside and the university of southern 
california 
but the nod went to a site outside simi valley some 50 miles 
northwest of los angeles a former country town that has become a 
bedroom community the library will be set in dry hills covered with 
scrub brush and dotted with cactus perhaps a fitting setting for 
the first president whose start in public life was as a cowboy actor 
community concerns more muted this time centered on visitor 
traffic and the location in an area set aside as a natural buffer 
between three growing communities environmentalists envisioned 
bulldozers rumbling over the tiny yellow sunflower known to 
scientists as pentachaeta lyonii as well as two other rare plants 
but environmental objections were headed off by compromise the 
foundation will try to replace any plants it destroys work to 
protect and spread the species on the site and limit public hours 
to minimize traffic

presidentelect george bush and mexicos 
incoming president carlos salinas de gortari meet tuesday in houston 
in a bid to move crossborder relations onto a smoother track after 
an extended period of recriminations 
bush said last week that with new administrations in both 
countries taking office at about the same time a tremendous 
opportunity is available for a cooperative relationship 
last friday bush conferred at length on the meeting with house 
speaker jim wright dtexas bush has promised that after taking 
office he will take no measures that affect mexico without first 
consulting mexican authorities 
bush will be accompanied to the luncheon meeting at the johnson 
space center by secretary of statedesignate james baker and 
treasury secretary nicholas brady salinas who will be inaugurated 
on dec 1 will be accompanied by top aides as well 
economic issues will be at the top of the agenda but the 
discussions also are expected to touch on drug smuggling central 
america and other issues 
salinas has said that mexicos obligations in servicing its 108 
billion foreign debt should be designed in a way that permits 
continued economic growth 
he is worried that protectionist trade pressures in the united 
states could lead to a decline in mexicos crossborder exports 
further aggravating an economic crisis that has afflicted the 
country since 1982 
a rise in us interest rates also would impair mexicos ability 
to repay its debt 
while the two countries have shown an ability to cooperate on 
economic issues there have been serious disagreements over central 
america and drugs 
the reagan administration has said that aside from cuba no 
hemispheric country has supported nicaraguas leftist government 
more enthusiastically than mexico which has played a leading role 
in the central american peace process 
in the 1987 un general assembly mexico supported the us 
position on issues of high priority to the united states less than 
15 per cent of the time according to state department figures 
one official insisting on anonymity said assistant secretary of 
state elliott abrams and mexicos foreign secretary bernardo 
sepulveda have a shoot on sight relationship 
both abrams and sepulveda will be replaced by their respective 
incoming presidents a state department official said there are 
preliminary indications that the new foreign ministry team being 
assembled by salinas may be less ideologically opposed to us 
administration views 
in a recent interview abrams said we have been very unhappy 
with what we consider the kind of ideological tone in some of 
mexicos foreign policy as distinct from a pragmatic tone 
there have been occasions when we felt that mexico was picking 
a fight with the united states not because it was in the interest 
of mexico to do so for what must have been complex reasons in 
mexicos foreign policy and mexicos domestic politics 
one recent sign of mexicos pursuit of an independent foreign 
policy was a visit to cuba by outgoing mexican president miguel de 
la madrid who conferred mexicos highest civilian decoration on 
president fidel castro 
on the drug issue mexico believes the united states bears much 
of the blame for continued narcotics trafficking across the border 
because of the strong us demand for drugs 
the reagan administration has been increasingly emphasizing a 
need to reduce demand but maintains that corruption and 
inefficiencies in mexico have impeded efforts to curb the drug 
flow 
according to the state department mexico is the principal source 
country for the production processing and trafficking of heroin and 
marijuana entering the united states

a marbleandbrass monument commemorating 
john f kennedys visits to the waterbury area has been found nearly 
25 years after it was cast and stored to await the opening of the 
presidential library in massachusetts 
robert carroll a member of the committee that commissioned the 
monument in 1964 in the wake of the presidents assassination said 
monday that he discovered the monument in a wolcott high school 
storage room in september 
he said he didnt tell anyone about the discovery until recently 
so the news would coincide with the 25th anniversary of the 
assassination on tuesday 
the wolcott residents who commissioned the monument intended to 
send it to the john f kennedy presidential library on the 
university of massachusetts campus in bostons dorchester section 
i think once they at the library see this its really the 
kind of a monument its probably valued at 4000 to 5000 that 
belongs there carroll said 
the white marble plaque with a brass plate the cost of which was 
underwritten by the scovill manufacturing co and chase brass amp 
copper co both of waterbury memorializes kennedys visits to 
waterbury on the eve of the 1960 election and in 1962 
an estimated 50000 people greeted kennedy on nov 6 1960 at 3 
am in downtown waterbury wolcott borders waterbury and carroll 
said many of its residents hail from the bluecollar city 
the monument bears the presidential seal and a quotation from a 
speech kennedy delivered on his second visit to waterbury on oct 
17 1962 
carroll said a blacktie ball in waterbury in november 1964 was 
held to remember the late presidents promise his mother rose 
kennedy attended carroll said 
the problem in 1964 was that the kennedy library had not been 
built yet so the plaque had to be stored somewhere until the 
library was complete he recalled 
carroll said he suggested keeping it in a closet in the high 
school the monument was promptly forgotten he said 
he said he had intended to bring it to the library on the 
assassination anniversary but the librarys curator and onetime 
kennedy assistant david powers reminded him that the family 
doesnt prefer to remember that date instead carroll said he 
will take the plaque to boston next year on may 29 the late 
presidents birthday 
powers said the library will accept the plaque but he couldnt 
say whether or not it will be displayed

stanford economist michael boskin said monday 
he was surprised by reports that presidentelect george bush was 
about to name him chairman of the presidents council of economic 
advisers 
boskin said he was sitting at home in california watching 
television when he first heard news reports over the weekend that he 
was about to be appointed bushs chief economic adviser 
i was quite suprised by the rumors boskin said in a 
telephone interview it is flattering to have my name mentioned as 
a possibility but presidentelect bush has many outstanding 
individuals who would make excellent appointments to the cea 
a conservative economist and expert on the social security 
system boskin is the father of bushs flexible freeze idea to 
drive down the deficit he is still considered the frontrunner to 
be named chairman of the economic council 
bush when asked by reporters on monday what had happened to 
boskins appointment said nothing happened just dont believe 
all the leaks you read in the newspapers 
craig fuller codirector of the transition said we have a 
high regard for him were still working on the chairmans 
appointment 
boskin called reports of the appointment premature and said 
he has not yet received any offer of a job in the bush 
administration 
boskin who described himself as a mainstream conservative 
said he expects bush will move quickly and decisively to assemble 
an outstanding team to assist him in the transition and the 
government but this wont happen overnight it may take a few 
weeks 
he praised bushs selection of richard darman as head of office 
of management and budget saying dick darman is one of the most 
talented people i know 
in addition to darman as omb director bush has asked treasury 
secretary nicholas brady to stay on in his administration 
that leaves the chairman of the council of economic advisers as 
the only top economic post remaining to be filled 
bush has said that he considered the naming of his economic team 
to be a priority as a way of sending a signal to jittery financial 
markets that the new administration planned to get a quick start in 
reducing the federal budget deficit

for thanksgiving dinner barbara used to fix 
herself a small salad while the rest of her family sat down to 
turkey and dressing 
lisa skipped dinner altogether one year and instead took an 
overdose of pills 
what should have been a holiday was a nightmare for the two women 
because they suffered from anorexia the thought of a bountiful 
feast spread out before them repulsed them 
but this year both barbara and lisa will sit down to a 
traditional thanksgiving meal with several hundred others who suffer 
from eating disorders the dinner is a part of the annual national 
eating disorders week originated by their doctor felix larocca a 
child psychiatrist who specializes in treating disorders like 
anorexia and bulimia 
its kind of like a homecoming said barbara who asked that 
her last name be withheld you feel a little more comfortable 
sitting with people who you know have the same problem its a 
little easier to eat 
the dinner will be a traditional one with all the trimmings 
roast turkey dressing wild rice broccoli glazed carrots mixed 
fruit dinner rolls cranberry sauce pumpkin pie and carrot cake 
victims of anorexia refuse to eat because they believe themselves 
fat even when theyre dangerously underweight while bulimia 
sufferers binge and purge eating sometimes enormous amounts of food 
and then throwing up 
most of those who suffer from these eating disorders are young 
white women bt more and more cases are being diagnosed among men 
blacks asians and children 
larocca is the founder of bash inc which stands for bulimia 
anorexia selfhelp based in st louis it is an internationally 
known program for people with eating disorders 
the annual dinner began five years ago to help laroccas patients 
shift the focus of the thanksgiving holiday away from food the 
idea is to socialize to get reacquainted he said the dinner 
is played down 
the first dinner was held after lisa tried to commit suicide with 
the overdose she took while home from college for thanksgiving 
she said she couldnt handle it she hated the holiday 
larocca said people talked about food and insisted everybody take 
seconds 
it was a miracle she survived but she made it and lived 
last year about 300 past and present patients of laroccas 
their families and friends attended the meal in conjunction with 
the meal seminars and workshops on eating and mood disorders are 
offered 
bash is the outpatient program for the bash treatment and 
research center based at deaconess hospital in st louis the 
program which larocca founded in 1981 seeks to restore proper 
eating habits to patients through behavior modification individual 
and group therapy and nutritional guidance 
both anorexia and bulimia can be fatal besides malnutrition 
victims of eating disorders can suffer electrolyte imbalances which 
can cause abnormal heart rhythms and amenorrhea the loss of 
menstruation frequent vomiting by bulimics can lead to tooth decay 
one victim was pop singer karen carpenter who died in 1983 at the 
age of 33 of complications of anorexia 
sufferers also can become addicted to diet pills and laxatives 
which can lower the bodys potassium content making heart failure a 
risk 
larocca said compulsive exercising is now being recognized as yet 
another tool for people who suffer eating disorders exercise 
addicts start quite innocently he said but once they get 
caught in the treadmill of exercise they suffer anxiety when they 
cant get their fix 
laroccas selfhelp program began with a suggestion from several 
of his anorexic and bulimic patients who met in a group with him 
once a month that a meeting that included relatives of people with 
eating disorders would be beneficial 
bash now reaches some 6000 people in the st louis area and 
with the distribution of its newsletter more than 15000 people 
around the world larocca said it also operates a 24hour tollfree 
crisis hotline 
both barbara and lisa have recovered although they still find 
the meetings helpful for dealing with selfimage problems 
now i dont feel i have to go so much for myself but to help 
other people said barbara who spent one thanksgiving in the 
hospital being fed through tubes its just amazing that knowing 
that other people have been through the same things helps a lot

new farm legislation should include more 
flexibility in the control of crop production so that producers can 
respond more readily to market opportunities a report to congress 
said monday 
the general accounting office report one of a series about 
issues in the forthcoming bush administration said the anticipated 
1990 farm bill needs to retain the authority of the agriculture 
department to influence crop production in times of surplus and 
scarcity 
but the gao an investigative arm of congress said the current 
farm law enacted in 1985 has had several shortcomings 
the law has helped us agriculture to become more competitive in 
the world market while maintaining farm income the report said 
this success however has come at a cost much higher than that 
of previous farm bills the gao said between fiscal years 1986 
and 1988 farm price and income support programs averaged over 20 
billion annually 
farm programs should be designed to prevent the accumulation of 
unneeded surpluses and still hold down the usdas costs of 
operating them the report said 
according to usda budget figures spending on farm commodity 
supports soared to a record 258 billion in fiscal 1986 the first 
year of operation under the 1985 law but have declined since then 
the 1985 farm bill moved farm programs in a more 
marketoriented direction the gao said however rigidities in 
the bills production control provisions have discouraged farmers 
from producing certain crops even when commerical market conditions 
are favorable 
for example it said the programs this year affected decisions 
of farmers in the corn belt who maintained their level of corn 
plantings and did not expand their soybeans despite a strong soybean 
market relative to corn 
increases in soybean acres may have improved market returns for 
agriculture and tempered production expansion by foreign producers 
who compete with us farmers in world markets the report said 
congress modified the law this year in response to the drought to 
allow soybeans to be planted on corn acres in 1989 without farmers 
losing future benefits under the corn program 
the 1990 farm bill debate should focus on such alternatives 
that retain usdas ability to influence crop production but provide 
more flexibility to respond to market opportunities the report 
said

canada the worlds secondlargest country 
sprawling across six time zones forbids broadcasters from spreading 
election results while polls remain open 
that means election coverage starts at 8 pm local time in each 
zone as the polls close unlike the us system where the pacific 
coast receives network coverage while voting continues 
weve got six time zones thats why weve got to be very 
cautious said jacques mackay of the federal elections canada 
agency of course its very difficult today in the age of 
comunications to limit it but its still done 
mackay said in a telephone interview from ottawa that the law 
prohibits broadcasters from talking about election results while 
polls remain open in any particular time zone 
its still possible to phone somebody in the east and say 
whats going on bazay said 
the majority of canadas population lives in quebec and ontario 
which are on eastern standard time those two provinces account for 
107 million of the 175 million voters registered for mondays 
election and 174 of the 295 seats in the house of commons 
that leads to complaints from those who live farther west 
especially british columbia which has 32 seats where polls close 
three hours later 
its very simple david bazay executive producer of the 
public canadian broadcasting corps network news said when asked 
to explain the system we do it every day as a matter of course 
our national news basically has five editions 
election programming for newfoundland where polls close at 630 
pm est can start in the central studio in toronto and be 
broadcast regionally the atlantic coast of nova scotia new 
brunswick and prince edward island is added an hour later then 
quebec and ontario 
we have a network we can put the entire national network 
together or parts of it together bazay said as the polls 
close across the country we simply put on election coverage 
its not complicated at all 
the private canadian tv network also was planning coverage 
starting at 8 pm local time global was not starting its coverage 
until about 1015 pm after the conclusion of a national hockey 
league game between st louis and toronto 
satellite and cable television are increasingly available to 
canadian households pierre pontbriand spokesman for the canadian 
radio and television commission said it was the responsibility of 
each satellite and cable licensee to comply with the election law

a coastal georgia town has regained its 
honor as the home of the brunswick stew champions of the world 
two local women reclaimed the stew championship this weekend in a 
spoontospoon battle with the dreaded enemy from brunswick county 
va 
lisa cook and fran kelly restaurant partners from nearby st 
simons island won top honors in the latest battle in the stew 
wars between brunswick ga and the virginia county both of 
which claim to be the birthplace of brunswick stew 
the honor of georgia has been very successfully defended on the 
brunswick stew battlefield said phyllis taunton of main street 
brunswick a sponsor of saturdays stewcooking contest 
last year virginians swept the first brunswick stew cookoff 
held in virginia and judged by an allvirginia panel of judges 
georgians have contended since then that the virginia contest was 
rigged saturdays contest on the other hand was fair mrs 
taunton said 
why 
the judges were three georgians atlanta tv personality leroy 
powell atlanta chef and author nathalie dupree and missy 
castleberry mcdavid of the castleberry foods family in augusta 
mrs taunton said the fact that george daniels of alberta va 
and bill denton of richmond took second and third places in the 
professional stewmaster category proved that the contest was on 
the level 
for the uninitiated brunswick stew is a spicy concoction of 
smoked meat chicken corn tomatoes and other ingredients

women will have 50 percent more restrooms 
than men in new public buildings in virginia as officialdom tries 
to compensate for the different lengths of time the sexes spend in 
the bathroom 
jack rollison of the house of delegates proposed the potty 
parity revision to the state building code after a study showed 
that women take longer in restrooms and are forced to wait in lines 
to use the facilities at sporting events and theaters the study 
said women take more time because they frequently are accompanied by 
small children and because they wear more clothes than men 
the state housing and community development board voted saturday 
to increase the required number of womens restrooms in public 
places by 50 percent effective march 1 the provision will apply 
only to new construction of large public gathering places such as 
sports arenas and movie theaters mens and womens restrooms are 
currently required to be built in an even ratio 
im pleased they made the change rollison said i think 
this will open some new doors for women in the commonwealth

to a winter with little more to do than tinker with his river boat 
last spring anton 42 left teaching for the opportunity of his 
dreams to captain the brand new 18 million spirit of peoria 
paddlewheeler 
i liked teaching and i thought i would really miss it when 
september rolled around i was afraid id drive by a school 
playground full of kids and really be drawn to it but that hasnt 
happened said anton whose deeply etched face bushy mustache and 
tousled hair make him resemble an earlier river boat captain mark 
twain 
instead of spending nine months fantasizing about the river 
anton is now living his dream in a pilot house 
this is my favorite place he said looking down on the 
windwhipped illinois river and the peoria skyline 
i look at the boat as a time machine while everyone else in 
the world is moving around at fast speed we go up and down the 
river at five miles per hour you really go back in time when you go

us and canadian jewish groups monday began 
fighting a proposal that would accept only orthodox conversions to 
judaism and limit converts who can immigrate to israel 
four us congressmen who met with foreign minister shimon peres 
said adopting the socalled who is a jew amendment would hurt 
usisraeli relations 
about 800 israelis demonstrated against the amendment monday as 
the newly elected parliament convened for the first time dont 
divide our people read their posters 
rep matthew mchugh dny told reporters the proposal would 
engender some strains which would not be healthy for the 
usisraeli relationship 
his congressional delegation organized by the usbased 
antidefamation league of bnai brith was one of three us and 
canadian jewish groups lobbying in israel against the amendment 
it would give orthodox rabbis exclusive authority to approve 
conversions to judaism this means jewish converts would be granted 
automatic israeli citizenship under the law of return only if 
brought into the faith by orthodox rabbis 
ultraorthodox political parties are demanding the change as a 
price for supporting either the rightwing likud bloc or 
leftleaning labor party the 18 parliament seats they won in nov 1 
elections may give them the power o choose who heads the next 
government 
the amendment is fiercely opposed by reform and conservative jews 
whose branches make up the majority of jews in the united states and 
canada 
we are dealing with 5 million american jews this law would 
make them feel like secondclass citizens said martin stein 
chairman of the trustees board of the united jewish appeal a major 
american jewish fundraiser 
richard cohen a spokesman for the new yorkbased american jewish 
committee said after meeting likud politicians that israel should 
not risk alienating us jews 
american jews see israel as an extension of ourselves if the 
law is imposed on us we will wonder if we are welcome in the state 
of israel said cohen 
peres told reporters he assured the congressmen that his labor 
party would vote against the proposed change even though it involves 
only a few foreign converts and does not affect most of israels 35 
million jews who are orthodox but nonobservant 
i believe its not terribly important for israel said peres 
but its very meaningful to american jewry 
but likud legislator ehud olmert said american jews wanting to 
affect policy should immigrate 
if you want to change israel you should come over here and 
fight through political channels he told members of the american 
jewish committee 
jerusalem mayor teddy kollek returning from a weeklong trip to 
the united states told a news conference american jews were so 
angry he feared changing the law could permanently damage 
usisrael relations 
some have threatened to donate money to american jewish causes or 
private israeli charities instead of directly to israel he said 
kollek said the controversy could also affect the us 
governments 3 billion dollars in annual foreign aid to israel 
if you dont have a united jewish community it is very 
doubtful if on its own the us administration will keep up the 
level of gifts he warned 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs likud bloc which narrowly 
defeated labor but failed to win an absolute majority in the 
elections has agreed to support the who is a jew legislation in 
exchange for the backing of four religious parties in a likudled 
government 
but the american campaign added to pressure from liberal 
israelis could prompt shamir and peres to join together in a 
coalition that would blunt the influence of ultraorthodox parties

a television reporter who was elected ohio 
county surveyor by writein votes says he has no intention of 
carrying out the duties of his office in fact he isnt even sure 
what they are 
it was a lark said donald wayne ullom a reporter for 
wtovtv of nearby steubenville ohio im flattered 
ullom won the nov 8 election with 28 writein votes writein 
votes also were cast for 27 other people 
no one filed to run for the office but several people warned 
ullom they would write his name on the ballot 
they could have written in anybodys name ullom said by 
some quirk of the imagination more people wrote in my name 
ullom who uses the name donald wayne on the air said he has no 
surveying experience but thats ok because the job has no duties 
and no salary 
in some counties they use the office said ohio county 
administrator tom samol here god i cant even remember the last 
time we used it 
i believe some counties use the office but what for i 
couldnt really tell you 
donald bartholomew served as ohio county surveyor from 1978 to 
1984 
nobodys used it no ones ever done anything with it 
bartholomew said theres no salary unless you negotiate with the 
ohio county commission theres no qualifications 
the state code requires the county surveyor to be called upon 
if there is to be a change in county line the county commission 
should order a survey of the entire county to be included in the new 
county 
its sort of an archaic position said gene adkins executive 
director of the west virginia association of counties theres no 
salary theyre not provided with anything in a few counties the 
county commission gives them a little office

american jewish leaders are suggesting that 
presidentelect george bush appoint a jew or other strong supporter 
of israel to a top post in an administration they see as taking 
shape without a voice for israel 
the appointment of john sununu the new hampshire governor of 
lebanese descent who will be bushs chiefofstaff concerned some 
jewish leaders and other appointments have not assuaged that 
concern they indicated monday 
none of them come to their posts with a clear message of 
heartfelt identification with israels security needs said hyman 
bookbinder formerly the washington representative of the american 
jewish committee and still a leading lobbyist for jewish and israeli 
causes 
none of this is meant to imply that bush is antiisrael 
added bookbinder who campaigned on behalf of democratic 
presidential candidate michael dukakis 
american jewish leaders consider the reagan administration 
including secretary of state george shultz the most proisrael 
administration ever 
bush ran on a strong proisrael platform but was viewed in the 
past with suspicion by jewish leaders for advocating an increase in 
saudi oil prices and for supporting some arms sales to arab nations 
bookbinder and others who echoed his sentiments but declined to 
be named suggested that bush appoint a jewish or proisrael cabinet 
member or un ambassador 
among the names mentioned were those of morris abram the 
chairman of the conference of presidents of major american jewish 
organization max kampelman the arms negotiator and richard 
schifter assistant secretary of state for human rights 
abram a conservative georgia democrat who campaigned for reagan 
and bush has also served presidents kennedy and carter on civil and 
human rights projects abram a partner in a new york law firm said 
he had not been contacted but i would be willing to hear what the 
presidentelect has to say i have great respect for him 
also mentioned by several jewish leaders was jeanne kirkpatrick 
who served as un ambassador during the first years of the reagan 
administration and is viewed as a staunch ally of israel 
it doesnt have to be a jew but we need someone who will make 
us feel better bookbinder said 
leaders of jewish organizations are to meet wednesday with sununu 
to voice their concerns about his record weve never had an 
arabamerican as gatekeeper to the president said one leader 
invited to the meeting i think theres legitimate cause for 
concern 
sununu whose grandfather was lebanese drew the ire of american 
jews as the only governor to decline to condemn a 1975 un 
resolution that equates zionism with racism 
standing at bushs side during a news conference announcing his 
selection for the white house job sununu said last week he had not 
wanted to involve his state in foreign affairs sununu said he 
rejects the 1975 resolution and supports the proisrael platform of 
the republican party which he helped write

the emerging bush administration includes 
prominent holdovers from the reagan years but with one clear and 
important difference the new team is tilted far more toward 
pragmatists than ideologues 
bush filled three more key positions monday and his choices were 
sure to set off cries of anguish from the right 
dick thornburgh will remain attorney general and lauro cavazos 
will stay on as education secretary both men were latecomers to 
the reagan administration and both replaced leading ideologues 
edwin meese iii and william bennett 
the third bush choice was richard darman to serve as director of 
the office of management and budget 
hes put together an eastern establishment republican 
administration said conservative activist richard viguerie 
thats discouraging 
highprofile jobs in the next administration are rapidly being 
filled and only one bush choice has drawn applause from 
conservatives gov john sununu of new hampshire who will serve as 
white house chief of staff 
the voting machines had hardly stopped humming with bushs 
40state election day victory when the presidentelect made the most 
obvious choice for his new administration friend adviser and 
campaign chairman james a baker iii to succeed george shultz as 
secretary of state 
during his tenure as white house chief of staff baker earned a 
reputation as a quintessential pragmatist a savvy insider who 
repeatedly gave low priority to the initiatives of the more 
ideological elements in the reagan administration calls on reagan 
to fire baker were always sure applause lines at conservative 
gatherings 
bakers deputy was darman 
quick to follow the baker selection was that of another old bush 
friend and adviser nicholas brady he will remain treasury 
secretary 
in fact another characteristic of the bush appointees is how 
many have longstanding ties to the presidentelect 
when ronald reagan was filling out his administration eight years 
ago he was meeting many of the top officials for the first time 
the same was true of democrat jimmy carter in 1976 
not so with bush his relationships with the people he has 
appointed goes back many years 
that should not be surprising considering the years bush has 
served in governmental and party posts the long resume he touted 
during the presidential campaign put him in close contact with other 
upandcoming republicans 
no one ever described bush as an ideologue and clearly the 
people he feels most comfortable with are as pragmatic as he 
its always tough to get the jump on a new president and name his 
cabinet for him but so far there have been no big surprises no 
choices from other than the names subject to the most speculation 
the names being mentioned for the remaining national security 
jobs are former texas sen john tower for defense and brent 
scowcroft for national security adviser or cia director 
scowcroft was national security adviser to president ford and is 
an establishment figure 
one conservative favorite whose name is frequently mentioned for 
a cabinet post is former new york rep jack kemp 
but kemp is most often mentioned as either labor or housing 
secretary the two areas where he is leaststringently ideological 
the former buffalo congressman has always enjoyed good relations 
with traditionally democratic unions and his major urban initiative 
is a proposal for enterprise zones to encourage businesses to locate 
in neighborhoods with high unemployment 
neither post would make kemp a major player in areas where his 
more ideological views on monetary and tax policy would have 
influence 
bush may yet come up with some appointees who will please 
hardline conservatives but there is no sign of a bennett a james 
watt or a donald hodel waiting in the wings

malaysia will close a major camp 
for vietnamese boat people and will turn away all new arrivals the 
foreign minister said monday 
the government would announce the date once it finalized details 
to shut down pulau bidong island camp said foreign minister abu 
hassan omar 
the island will be gazetted declared a prohibited area and 
refugees arriving in malaysia after that date will be turned away 
he said after opening the asia and pacific regional seminar on 
refugees and displaced persons 
abu hassan said rejecting the boat people formed the first phase 
of the governments decision to close the camp which now houses 
about 12900 refugees 
the second phase he said was the final closure once all 
refugees had been repatriated to their own country or resettled in 
willing third countries 
pulau bidong an island 180 miles from kuala lumpur on the east 
coast of peninsular malaysia was turned into a refugee center after 
the 1975 communist victory in vietnam when thousands of vietnamese 
fled to the shores of malaysia and other southeast asian countries 
the government has spent about 2623 million to maintain the 
camp abu hassan said 
addressing the seminar he said malaysia was not prepared to open 
its doors to the boat people because they had abused the temporary 
asylum provided them he did not elaborate 
he said more refugees had come to malaysia between january and 
september this year than throughout last year there were 1008 
arrivals last month he said 
until the principle of first asylum is correctly addressed by 
the international community the phenomena will one day be 
remembered as a problem rather than a solution abu hassan said 
he called on vietnam to prevent the illegal departure of its 
people and to accept the return of those not selected for final 
resettlement in third countries

presidentelect george bush should cancel some 
weapons and look for other pentagon savings as part of the effort to 
control the defense budget a congressional agency said monday 
the general accounting office in one of a series of reports on 
issues facing bush when he takes office jan 20 noted that even 
though each of the services says it needs many billions of dollars 
more to complete its modernization and expansion programs the 
current 300 billion defense budget isnt likely to be increased for 
the forseeable future 
current pentagon plans include programs which would cost about 
200 billion more than the defense department can expect to 
receive during the fiveyear period which ends in 1992 the 
congressional watchdog agency said 
bush and the democraticcontrolled congress need to take a number 
of actions to reduce future defense expenditures the gao said 
those include 
reducing and realigning planned programs in so doing cancel 
marginal systems and delay systems not ready for production it 
did not give examples 
seeking common missions in the past for example we have 
developed a variety of systems landbased to aircraft to attack 
tanks 
carefully assessing the longterm impact of planned weapons the 
gao said that recalling four world war ii battleships from mothballs 
was cheaper than building four new warships but operating three of 
the ships will cost 150 million this year and require about 4600 
personnel 
rethinking americas farflung network of worldwide commitments 
the rising costs of our worldwide commitments in the absence of 
increased burdensharing by our allies may simply be unaffordable 
the new administration also needs to take steps to try to end the 
series of weapons purchasing scandals and high prices for spare 
parts 
one improvement would be in the pentagon office which oversees 
what is supposed to be the realistic testing of weapons the gao 
said 
the usefulness of the current testing system has been limited 
because of insufficient resources to conduct testing deferrel of 
certain critical tests until after the production decision failure 
to simulate realistic battlefield conditions during testing and 
acceptance of products which do not meet the test criteria it 
said

a computer chip maker has adopted a strict 
nosmoking policy in its texas plants in a policy shift that some 
predict will sweep the us semiconductor industry 
the new rules which take effect jan 2 apply to all texas 
employees of advanced micro devices inc 2200 in austin and 900 
in san antonio 
its kind of a pilot project in texas said david frink a 
local spokesman for the californiabased company 
the company plans to remove ash trays and cigarette machines and 
has encouraged workers to join smoking cessation classes designed 
by the american cancer society 
employees previously were allowed to smoke in designated areas 
although never in the clean rooms where delicate computer chips 
are made 
frink said the company revised its smoking policy to eliminate a 
potential source of chipdestroying contaminants a speck of dust or 
smoke particle can block part of a microscopic circuit and ruin a 
chip 
he said it also responds to recent evidence linking nonsmokers 
health hazards to secondhand smoke 
the company chose texas for the experiment because its operations 
are smaller here than in california frink told the austin 
americanstatesman in addition chips made in texas are among its 
most sensitive 
other chipmakers predicted more companies would follow suit 
stan victor a spokesman for texas instruments in dallas said 
the company discourages smoking but has not yet gone as far as 
advanced micro devices 
texas instruments offers smoking cessation classes to employees 
and their spouses victor said and asks clean room employees who 
smoke during breaks to rinse their mouths with water and wait at 
least five minutes before reentering the chipmaking area 
scott wyman a spokesman for international business machines 
corp said the company has banned smoking in some of its newer 
manufacturing buildings but it allows designated smoking areas in 
compliance with an austin ordinance 
the manager of contamination engineering for sematech keith 
dillenbeck said advanced micro devices policy likely will spread 
through the industry 
there is a trend in that direction dillenbeck said 
dillenbeck said technical journals have indicated smoke can 
linger in the mouth and lungs as well as cling to clothes and hair 
as long as two hours after smoking 
as a result he said smokers in the clean room may generate as 
many as 10 times more particles than nonsmokers

george bushs three holdover cabinet appointees 
wont face a second round of senate confirmation hearings thanks to 
a ruling 60 years ago on thentreasury secretary andrew mellon 
senate officials said monday 
bush has asked attorney general dick thornburgh education 
secretary lauro cavazos and treasury secretary nicholas brady to 
stay in their jobs in his new administration 
all three men have joined the reagan administration since august 
and all experienced no problems being confirmed by a majority of the 
senate 
michael davidson the senates legal counsel said they wouldnt 
have to undergo the confirmation process next year unless bush 
wanted them to if he did the men would formally resign only to be 
renominated by bush 
that wont happen bushs transition aides said 
were following the precedent that we think was wisely 
followed by martin van buren who did not submit his nominees that 
were held over for reconfirmation said craig fuller codirector 
of bushs transition office 
since george washingtons time there have been cases of cabinet 
appointees remaining in office over the span of more than one 
president according to davidson the senates legal counsel 
for example secretary of state timothy pickering served both 
washington and john adams without separate confirmation hearings he 
said 
but the practice was tested in 1929 when a senate judiciary 
committee panel investigated the case of mellon a republican 
financier who was treasury secretary in the harding coolidge and 
hoover administrations davidson said 
this was undertaken in the case of mellon but it is applicable 
to thornburgh cavazos and brady he said 
six decades ago the senators concluded cabinet appointees need 
not face additional senate confirmation rounds because there was no 
statute limiting their terms davidson said 
they the members of the senate were of the opinion such 
officials could remain in office indefinitely he said at the 
pleasure of the president 
if the senate wanted to require new confirmation hearings on 
holdover appointments at the end of an administration it would have 
to pass a law on that subject davidson said 
two days after bush was elected on nov 8 president reagan 
ordered all his appointees to submit their resignations in a timely 
fashion 
bushs decision to name the holdover cabinet people obviously 
signals that reagan will not accept resignations from thornburgh 
brady and cavazos according to melinda kitchell a spokeswoman for 
the education department

the company discourages smoking but has not yet gone as far as 
advanced micro devices 
texas instruments offers smoking cessation classes to employees 
and their spouses victor said and asks clean room employees who 
smoke during breaks to rinse their mouths with water and wait at 
least five minutes before reentering the chipmaking area 
scott wyman a spokesman for international business machines 
corp said the company has banned smoking in some of its newer 
manufacturing buildings but it allows designated smoking areas in 
compliance with an austin ordinance 
the manager of contamination engineering for sematech keith 
dillenbeck said advanced micro devices policy likely will spread 
through the industry 
there is a trend in that direction dillenbeck said 
dillenbeck said technical journals have indicated smoke can 
linger in the mouth and lungs as well as cling to clothes and hair 
as long as two hours after smoking 
as a result he said smokers in the clean room may generate as 
many as 10 times more particles than nonsmokers

women are starting to smoke earlier in life 
smoking more and inhaling more deeply than they did in the 1960s 
according to surveys by the american cancer society 
the incidence of lung cancer in women increased fivefold during 
that time from an average of 24 cases per 100000 women in 
19601964 to 131 per 100000 between 1982 and 1986 the cancer 
society said 
the number of women who smoke 20 or more cigarettes a day climbed 
by 20 percent between 19601964 when the cancer society conducted 
its first cancer prevention survey and 19821986 when it 
conducted the cancer prevention survey ii 
the results of the latest survey in which 619225 women were 
given questionnaires appear in the dec 1 issue of the scientific 
journal cancer research 
the survey also found that more women have quit smoking and that 
there is actually a drop in smoking rates in women under age 45 
if trends continue this will be followed by a similar 
downtrend in womens lung cancer rates said lawrence garfinkel 
one of the authors of the study

nine states filed a new lawsuit monday against 
the environmental protection agency in their 5year legal effort to 
force the agency to order new acid rain controls in the midwest 
the states joined by the national audubon society asked the 
us circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia to review 
epas refusal to act on their petition seeking those controls 
that petition called on epa to publish for public comment the 
determination of the carter administrations epa chief that sulfur 
dioxide emissions from the united states were harming canada such a 
publication is the first step in drafting a regulation 
the canadian province of ontario and two environmental 
organizations filed a similar lawsuit in the same court on nov 1 
a few days before leaving office in january 1981 epa 
administrator douglas costle wrote secretary of state edmund muskie 
that these emissions were harming canada by being transformed in the 
atmosphere into sulfuric acid which falls as acid rain in eastern 
canada 
many of these sulfur dioxide emissions originate in the us 
midwest in power plant and factory smokestacks 
once such a determination is made us law requires epa to order 
affected states to revise their air pollution control plans to 
eliminate the offending emissions but the appeals court in a 
decision upheld by the supreme court ruled earlier that a letter to 
the secretary of state was not formal enough and any such 
determination had to be made in formal proceedings leading to a 
regulation 
ontario the nine states and various environmental groups all 
petitioned for such formal proceedings but epa in october said it 
would not act on those petitions because it still did not know 
enough to tell states in the midwest how to revise their air 
pollution control measures 
environmentalists say acid rain has made hundreds of lakes in the 
adirondack mountains of new york state unlivable for fish canada 
says 14000 lakes in the eastern half of that country have been 
damaged 
david wooley an assistant attorney general of new york state 
one of the plaintiff states said in albany ny the states are 
entitled to sue because they are harmed by the same pollutant 
harming canada he said he has asked that his lawsuit be 
consolidated with ontarios 
in addition to new york the plaintiff states are the six new 
england states new jersey and minnesota

lawmakers in kentucky the nations leading 
tobacco producer are pressuring the university of louisville to 
drop its plan to restrict smoking days after a government report 
showed the state had the nations highest smokingrelated death rate 
the chairman of the state house agriculture committee said monday 
that the controversy over designated nonsmoking areas at the 
university is about economics and individual rights not about 
health 
but supporters of segregating smokers said that health is the 
overriding concern and that they are not enemies of the tobacco 
industry in a state where it accounts for an estimated 54000 jobs 
and where burley tobacco is the no 1 cash crop with 451 million in 
sales last year 
the dispute grew out of the universitys consideration of a 
policy to ban smoking in classrooms reception areas and elevators 
and to permit smoking only in designated areas of most other 
buildings 
members of the general assemblys tobacco task force reacted by 
threatening to cut the universitys budget 
i dont think were fighting for the tobacco industry or the 
tobacco farmer were talking about peoples rights here said 
rep clay crupper chairman of the agriculture and natural resources 
committee 
crupper said it sends a bad signal to the rest of the country 
when kentucky joins the list of places where tobacco is under attack 
at a meeting in owensboro late sunday crupper first called on 
the taskforce members to approve a resolution asking the university 
to back down but he later agreed to give the university until the 
task forces dec 5 meeting to revise its policy 
a newly released report by the us centers for disease control 
shows kentucky with the nations highest smokingrelated death rate 
kentucky reported 176 smokingrelated deaths for every 100000 
residents in 1985 the agency reported thursday nationwide smoking 
killed 314574 americans that year 
agriculture commissioner ward butch burnette a smoker and 
promoter of the tobacco industry said the state universitys 
proposed smoking policy was a slap at the farmers and companies that 
pay taxes on their tobacco business 
i personally believe that since we are such a large tobacco 
state it is a mistake for a school like u of l to do that because 
so many of their tax dollars come from it burnette said 
dan hall special assistant to louisvilles president said the 
school expected some backlash when it began considering the policy 
but is trying to balance health concerns and individual rights 
given the history and the fact that tobacco has played an 
important role in the history of the commonwealth we expected there 
would be some reaction to it hall said 
this is not an antismoking policy this is not an antitobacco 
policy hall said

jury selection began monday in the trial of 
two people charged with bilking 31000 lonely men out of more than 
4 million by promising them a paradise called chondaza filled with 
naked women 
donald s lowry 59 of bettendorf iowa and pamala st charles 
24 of moline ill who operated the church of love are charged 
with multiple counts of mail fraud one count of conspiracy and 
unlawful use of fraud proceeds 
prosecutors contend letters were sent to prospective male members 
telling them of the church of love which they said was founded in 
1965 by a teenage mexican girl named maria simona mireles 
the girl known as mother maria supposedly lived with young 
women known as the angels of love in an old farm building in 
northwestern illinois the letters said mother maria and the church 
of love wanted to establish a valley paradise to be known as 
chondaza where men could join the angels have all their wishes 
fulfilled and spend the rest of their lives 
men who sent donations received personalized love letters racy 
audio casettes and photos of naked women identified as members of 
the secret sect prosecutors said 
prosecutors contend the paradise never existed and that money 
they solicited was funneled to the personal use of the churchs 
founders and their employees 
defense attorneys say the organization was nothing more than a 
lonely hearts club that provided fantasies for shy men 
indictments issued in december charged that lowry and ms st 
charles under the guise of their col corp mailed letters to the 
men asking them to send between 20 and 30 for a membership fee

violated when the government seized his passport 
the lawyer gibson kamau kuria had his passport seized when he

who said they were tortured by police while being detained without 
charges 
kuria who also was detained without charges for eight months

kurias lawyer murungi kiraitu petitioned for a hearing to 
determine whether the government denied kuria his legal right to 
travel by withholding his passport 
justice cecil miller said monday that kurias application for a 
constitutional court was misconceived 
the constitutional court can only be constituted where there is 
a contitutional point in the case keiwua had argued in this 
case there is no such constitutional point raised by the applicant 
kiraitu who is kurias law partner said he would appeal 
millers ruling 
on wednesday georgetown university gave kuria the robert f 
kennedy human rights award for his work in defense of political

a transport strike stranded thousands 
of people and forced schools in manila and cebu to close monday 
when president corazon aquino marked her first 1000 days in office 
by promising economic revival 
the military capital command said service on about 80 percent of 
the 445 passenger jeep routes in manila was disrupted by a strike 
called by drivers demanding lower prices for spare parts 
it also affected about half the jeep routes in cebu the 
countrys secondlargest metropolitan area 350 miles southeast of 
manila officials said drivers in cebu walked out when they heard of 
the manila strike 
mrs aquino said she had been trying to get prices reduced and 
would meet with strikers and spare parts dealers tuesday in search 
of a compromise 
no serious violence was reported in manila but police arrested 15 
drivers among them was medardo roda leader of the militant jeep 
drivers association piston which led the walkout 
the union demanded price reductions after a presidential decree 
last week that dropped the minimum fare to about 3 cents for a 
2mile ride the old rate was about 4 cents but the drivers 
actually charge about 5 cents 
twentysix military trucks and buses picked up stranded commuters 
during manilas evening rush hour monday the governmentowned light 
rail transit system not affected by the strike reported a 66 
percent increase in riders and extended its operating hours 
police said the 15 strikers were arrested in various parts of 
metropolitan manila for allegedly forcing some drivers to join the 
protest 
roda was arrested outside the main post office after leaving a 
news conference police said he may face charges of inciting to 
sedition for saying in a broadcast interview he would fight the 
government to the last 
a statement by the may first movement a labor confederation to 
which piston belongs accused the government of repressive 
measures in responding to the legitimate struggles and legitimate 
demands of our people 
mrs aquino told reporters she had asked spare parts dealers to 
cut prices and was really disappointed that drivers went ahead 
with the strike 
monday was her 1000th day in the presidency she assumed feb 25 
1986 as the result of a civilianmilitary uprising that forced 
president ferdinand e marcos to flee to hawaii 
in a televised speech monday mrs aquino said her administration 
had restored democratic institutions and she would make economic 
progress the priority of her final years in office she set a goal 
of 65 percent annual growth through the end of her term in 1992 and 
pledged to create a million new jobs each year 
she said blamed rightwing opponents for the slow pace of social 
reform which critics cite as a shortcoming of her government 
military dissidents have attempted six coups the most recently in 
august 1987 
the military rebels succeeded in all but destroying the faith 
and confidence of the world in our country she said 
also on monday military spokesmen said the army had released 17 
human rights activists including a dutch woman social worker after 
15 hours of detention in piat 220 miles north of manila the 
activists had spent five days investigating rights violations in the 
area and were freed without charges said capt eufracio villegas 
army commander in cagayan province 
mrs aquino made little mention of plans for safeguarding human 
rights and fighting communist and moslem insurgencies she said a 
60day nationwide ceasefire with the communists which expired in 
february 1987 had split rebel leadership and the rebellion was 
losing support 
our policy of reconciliation first and force when it fails 
has brought down the strength of the insurgency considerably she 
said 
reaction to the speech was mixed 
sen aquilino pimentel who supports the president said the 
insurgency is still active poverty is still to be eradicated 
public corruption is still to be curtailed the debilitating foreign 
debt is still to be tackled and foreign domination of many aspects 
of philippine society is still a fact of life 
wilfrido villacorta a university professor and member of a 
commission that drafted the new constitution said he was 
disappointed by the slight mention of human rights the leadership 
still perceives itself as a mere facilitator of transition rather 
than a trailblazing harbinger of social change 
task force detainees an organization supported by the roman 
catholic church said 660 people were slain for political motives 
from march 1986 thorugh june

former presidents carter and ford said in a 
report monday that the federal budget deficit the no 1 problem 
facing presidentelect george bush could be reduced by cutting 
spending and raising taxes on motor fuel beer wine and cigarettes 
the expresidents said they went over the report with bush 
though they wouldnt give details of their meeting with him at the 
old executive office building adjacent to the white house they said 
he listened to them attentively 
while bush says his economics team will move swiftly to tackle 
deficits once he takes office jan 20 he has promised not to raise 
taxes asked by reporters about the reports proposal to increase 
excise taxes he replied the expresidents didnt mention that to 
me 
carter and ford were the cochairmen of a bipartisan group that 
wrote the report entitled american agenda some 340 experts 
including former secretary of state henry kissinger and former 
treasury secretary michael blumenthal contributed to what ford 
called a full platter of recommendations 
during the presidential campaign bush occasionally derided the 
most recent democratic administration presided over by carter but 
carter said monday he felt no bitterness toward bush or other 
republicans 
now is a time of healing he said adding that both he and 
ford had offered to help bush deal with congress in implementing 
programs that would serve the united states 
the budget deficit which reached about 155 billion this year 
was given priority in the report carter said people at home and 
abroad are vociferous in demanding that bush spell out a 
program on how the deficit is going to be reduced 
carter contended there was no practical way to balance a 
budget by 1993 solely with spending cuts revenues must also be 
raised he said he defended the idea of a stiffer tax on 
cigarettes which he said are a leading cause of death in the united 
states 
the report suggests bush and congress agree to a 40 billion 
annual reduction in the deficit as long as there is no recession 
bush should work with congress to develop a bipartisan budget 
agreement covering two or four years until the budget is balanced in 
the mid1990s it says 
bush could take a number of steps to balance the budget the 
report says 
they include freezing defense spending at current levels adjusted 
for inflation holding social security costofliving increases to 2 
percent less than the consumer price index reducing medicare fees 
for doctors as well as trimming agriculture price supports and 
public works and transportation appropriations while increasing 
taxes on gasoline cigarettes beer and wine 
the reports other priorities in descending order after the 
budget deficit are national security and arms control the savings 
and loan crisis third world debt and international trade the fate 
of children at risk and us relations with allies 
the expresidents said bushs second tier of priorities issues 
of compelling and intrinsic importance but not requiring immediate 
action should be productivity and education us relations with 
the soviet union mexico nicaragua and central america the 
environment and drugs 
on national security the report suggests that the united states 
continue research on star wars the two former presidents said 
however that they do not believe a total missile defense shield is 
possible they also recommend continuing talks with the soviet union 
on reducing conventional and strategic weapons 
other key issues dealt with in the report are 
the savings and loan crisis ford and carter recommend working 
out a plan with congress to raise 50 billion to 100 billion to pay 
off depositors in insolvent thrifts as well as reforming the 
insurance fund ford called the savings and lone crisis one of the 
most serious facing the administration 
international trade and third world debt the report proposes 
upgrading the position of the us trade representative and making 
early threats of retaliation against blatantly unfair trade 
practices it also suggests strengthening dispute mechanisms in 
multilateral trade pacts 
children at risk the report advocates more federal aid for 
programs that help poor children such as head start prenatal care 
and feeding programs 
us relations with the allies the report says bush should 
reassure allies in europe and the pacific that us commitments will 
be kept and that stability and progress on arms control policy will 
be maintained

presidentelect george bush should make 
vigorous use of new powers that congress has given the president to 
get satisfaction from other countries in trade disputes a 
congressional investigative agency said monday 
in one of a series of reports on important issues for the 
transition to the new presidency the general accounting office said 
it has found many instances when a followup was needed to get the 
benefits of an international trade agreement 
it added that delaying tactics and slow dispute settlements have 
often frustrated efforts to get satisfaction but the new trade act 
strengthens the us hand 
failure to gain timely satisfaction can now trigger a 
unilateral us response the gao report said the new 
administration should show strong resolve to vigorously use these 
new powers 
one provision of the trade law reagan signed in august permits 
him to specify what he considers highpriority unfair trade 
practices and to start action toward retaliation while trying to get 
a settlement by negotiation 
another provision permits him to rule that a country denying 
internationally recognized rights to labor can be considered as 
engaging in an unfair trade practice and to retaliate against its 
trade 
the gao complained of defects in efforts to promote exports it 
said the commerce department has chosen questionable trade promotion 
events and has been active in countries with little or no potential 
for buying more us goods it did not specify the nations 
it characterized as largely symbolic the controls put on 
exports to further foreign policy objectives as distinct from 
controls that have security objectives 
when these controls are symbolic they do not prevent the 
targeted country from getting the controlled products from other 
countries the report said 
instead their costs are borne by american businesses in the 
form of export sales lost to firms in other countries 
the report did not specify either the countries targeted by the 
us controls or their suppliers one nation to which exports are 
controlled for foreign policy reasons is south africa where 
japanese and west european suppliers have replaced many exports that 
can now no longer be shipped by americans

israels 12th parliament opened monday with 
fiery exchanges between political rivals and a plea from president 
chaim herzog to save the institution from the weakening of its 
foundations 
fifteen members initially refused to take the oath of office from 
a representative of the extreme right dramatizing their opposition 
to his partys advocacy of expelling arabs from the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip 
about 1000 israelis most of them teenagers demonstrated 
outside against demands by ultraorthodox religious parties that 
only conversions to judaism by orthodox rabbis be recognized 
in the atmosphere of sharp division prime minister yitzhak 
shamir continued seeking a broadly based coalition including the 
rival labor party of foreign minister shimon peres 
labor and shamirs rightwing likud bloc have been equal partners 
in a national unity coalition government since indecisive 1984 
elections 
likud won 40 seats in the 120member knesset or parliament in 
the nov 1 elections and labor got 39 shamir has been negotiating 
with small religious and rightwing parties for a parliamentary 
majority as well as offering labor a junior partnership 
labor and likud leades met monday night for what could be a 
critical negotiating session labor officials said 
before the meeting peres expressed pessimism about prospects for 
an agreement with likud in my estimation we are heading for the 
opposition benches the daily davar quoted peres as saying in an 
interview published monday 
israeli media quoted shamir as saying the chances of forming a 
broad government are close to nil but his spokesman yossi ahimeir 
said the question remained open 
its a war of nerves ahimeir said of course he would like 
as broad a government as possible if it is possible all options 
are open 
labor wants two of three important ministries defense finance 
and foreign affairs likud has agreed to give only one preferably 
defense 
in the knesset leftist legislators from six parties refused to 
take the oath from yair sprinzak 77 who as the oldest member was 
made chairman of the meeting in keeping with tradition 
in my worst nightmare i never thought someone like you would 
swear me in as a member of parliament dissenting legislator yossi 
sarid shouted in protest 
three arab members tawfiq zayad tawfiq toubi and abdel wahab 
daraushe refused the oath by saying they would swear only to 
fight against oppression and transfer 
transfer is the term sprinzaks moledet party uses for expelling 
arabs 
the 15 protesting legislators later agreed to take the oath so 
they could vote for a knesset speaker 
sprinzak whose late father yosef was the speaker of israels 
first parliament was shouted down when he tried to explain his 
partys platform 
our movement aims to protect our gains from the sixday war 
sprinzak said referring to the 1967 middle east war in which israel 
captured the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip from egypt 
we want to preserve the entire land of israel and prevent the 
relinquishing of any parts of it he added 
finance minister moshe nissim was so angered by the spectacle 
that he mounted the podium pounded his fist and declared ive 
never seen such a mockery made of our parliament before the eyes of 
our people the whole world 
dov shilansky of likud a survivor of the nazi holocaust was 
elected speaker 
herzog who presided said at the ceremonial session in israel 
today one senses a gloomy atmosphere an exaggerated sense of 
confusion and distress we dare not take this democracy for 
granted history has known many a democratic government that 
collapsed in time of crisis we too are not immune to developments 
which may endanger this house 
the test of your membership in this supreme body of israeli 
democracy will be your readiness and capacity to protect it from the 
weakening of its foundations

insolvent savings and loans should be shut down 
as soon as possible the general accounting office said monday 
criticizing the current policy of keeping troubled institutions 
alive with government rescues 
the time has come to move as quickly as possible to close 
insolvent institutions the congressional watchdog agency said in 
one of a series of transition reports addressed to the next 
administration and congress 
that means fully recognizing and finding the money to pay for 
the losses in those institutions money that fslic the federal 
savings and loan insurance corp does not have today it said 
in another report former presidents jimmy carter and gerald ford 
called on presidentelect george bush to close all insolvent sampls 
within two years 
the current approach of merging or selling insolvent 
institutions defers but does not solve the problem ford and 
carter said in their report entitled american agenda 
the two former presidents said the industry must continue to pay 
for the cleanup of ailing institutions but they acknowledged the 
next president and congress also must go to the taxpayers 
gao analyst craig simmons said his agencys call for swiftly 
closing insolvent thrift institutions was an implicit criticism of 
the current federal home loan bank board policy of rescuing failed 
thrifts by providing private investors with government cash and 
guarantees against future loss 
simmons said the gao was not against all mergers but said so far 
the bank board hasnt had the money to recognize all the losses and 
is covering them with openended guarantees 
theyre not really resolving the problem in the sense of 
putting it behind them he said 
the gao also said the problem was too large for the industry to 
bear alone and said the depositing public must help either 
through an appropriation of tax dollars or some sort of user charge 
karl hoyle a spokesman for the bank board said there are 
inherent dangers to local economies in closing too many 
institutions selling too much of the property from failed sampls too 
fast would drag down the value of property held by healthy 
institutions he said 
there are places in the country where wholesale closings would 
result in no services to a community he said it would be 
devastating if we were to do wholesale liquidations in a state like 
texas 
the bank board has resolved 146 cases so far this year but only 
26 of them by closing an institution he said 
both the gao and the former presidents recommended reforms to 
prevent a repeat of the sampl mess estimated to cost 50 billion to 
100 billion to resolve 
carter and ford said the fslic should be administratively merged 
with the fund for commercial banks under a common regulatory board 
a move opposed by the sampl industry they called for unspecified 
reforms to the deposit insurance system 
simmons said the gao believed a fundamental reform of deposit 
insurance was not needed immediately and could delay the resolution 
of the crisis although it did recommend reconsidering the wisdom 
of the regulatory distinctions between thrift institutions and 
commercial banks 
the agency suggested experimenting with several reforms one 
called riskbased deposit insurance would charge higher premiums to 
banks that make risky investments another known as a narrow bank 
proposal would restrict sampls to investing deposits in nearly 
riskfree areas such as government securities

an environmental organization said monday it 
would seek a congressional investigation into the environmental 
protection agencys softening of an internal report on the status of 
pollution monitoring at hazardous waste landfills 
the internal document found significant noncompliance with 
ground water monitoring requirements but a report released publicly 
by the epa last month painted a rosy picture according to the 
environmental defense fund 
an epa official said the groups complaint was overstated and out 
of date 
the fund released two documents one the internal report of the 
agencys ground water monitoring task force submitted in 1987 and 
the other published in october of this year entitled hazardous 
waste ground water task force 1987 status report and 19881989 
program recommendations 
the task force was formed in 1984 and disbanded in 1987 
originally assigned to investigate ground water montoring at 58 
sites it completed field work at 24 before turning over the task to 
other epa offices 
kathie stein an attorney with the environmental defense fund 
said the 1988 document waters down the findings and conclusions of 
the task force and paints an overly rosy picture in an effort to 
make the american people believe that the epa has the situation 
under control 
after 1984 amendments tightened federal hazardous waste laws 
only about 250 facilities decided to remain in operation 
the 1987 document said that in the experience of the task force 
the majority of monitoring well systems are not capable of 
immediately detecting or assessing a release from a disposal unit 
that phrase did not appear at the corresponding point in the 1988 
document 
the later document instead contained this phrase all 24 
facilities had some defects in either the construction or location 
of their monitoring wells 
j winston porter epas assistant administrator for solid waste 
and emergency response said a lot of things that were pointed out 
in the internal report were true and what came out of this was a 
major uprgade of monitoring at hazardous waste facilities 
but to claim that the internal report was watered down for public 
consumption he said is a lot of nonsense people get hold of 
interim draft reports and if they find one iota of difference they 
charge whitewash this wasnt a draft this was partial input 
we didnt use all of it

training in the department of defense

at least 7000 ethnic albanians 
angered by the ouster of two leaders defied threats of a crackdown 
and took to the streets in heavy rain monday extending a wave of 
ethnic protest for a fifth straight day 
the demonstrators marched about 40 miles to pristina capital of 
the restive southern province of kosovo 
in the northern republic of slovenia about 13000 people braved 
a snowstorm monday to press for more democracy the two protests 
were not related 
the slovenians called for a referendum on controversial 
constitutional changes and for acquittal of four men sentenced to 
jail for making public a classified military document a rally in 
revolution square in ljubljana the slovenian capital drew 10000 
people and another rally in celje 42 miles northeast of ljubljana 
drew 3000 
slovenian courts acted at the last minute monday to postpone the 
scheduled jailing of the three journalists and one army officer 
whose sentencing last summer led to protests and petitions in the 
most liberal of yugoslavias six republics 
kosovo protesters were angered by the resignations thursday of 
azem vlasi and kacusa jasari both ethnic albanian members of the 
provinces 13member ruling politburo 
the two stepped down under pressure from serbian communist party 
leader slobodan milosevic who wants greater control over kosovo for 
its republic serbia he has demanded changes in the 1974 
constitution that gave kosovo broad autonomy 
provincial party leaders have promised to review the resignations 
of the two ethnic albanians later this week 
in a speech monday in belgrade milosevic reiterated his demand 
for the constitutional changes he says are needed to protect 
kosovos serb minority from harassment by ethnic albanians he made 
no reference to the weekend protests in kosovo by up to 100000 
ethnic albanians 
at mondays protest in a pristina sports hall a crowd of about 
7000 mostly workers who trudged 40 miles from the town of 
orohovac dispersed after a serbian factory worker defied milosevic 
and backed the ethnic albanians 
the worker ruzica imsa was cheered wildly as she spoke out 
against the constitutional reforms pressed by many of her fellow 
serbs 
the working class will not allow itself to be pushed around 
she said we will not let anyone impose constitutional changes the 
people do not want 
local communist party leaders were jeered and whistled when they 
tried to get the crowd to return home they then persuaded imsa to 
return to the microphone and her calm appeal succeeded in 
dispersing the crowd 
later another crowd of about 2000 people arrived from the town 
of klina some 40 miles north of pristina 
officials had warned of a crackdown if protesters took to the 
streets at an earlier gathering at pristina university acting 
provincial party head remzi koljgeci told students unspecified 
measures would go into force if more protests occurred 
under a package of constitutional amendments due to be passed by 
each republic by next week milosevic wants to restore serbian 
control over kosovos judiciary education and policing 
the amendments are designed to simplify the complex federal 
constitution and give the legal framework to introduce 
marketoriented economic reform 
most of milosevics address dwelt on the need for economic change 
and strongly attacked bureaucrats for opposing it 
communist leaders in yugoslavias other five republics see 
milosevics campaign as a drive to increase the influence of serbia 
the largest republic on the yugoslav federation 
but milosevic claims the changes would only put serbia on an 
equal footing with other republics which have no administrative 
provinces like serbias kosovo and vojvodina 
in slovenia the proposed reforms have run into opposition from 
intellectuals who fear greater central control of the republics 
relatively liberal judiciary 
the rally in ljubljana pressed demands for a referendum on the 
reforms which intellectuals believe would be strongly opposed in 
slovenia

tens of thousands of oil workers 
returned to work monday ending a 10day strike that caused 
widespread shortages of cooking gas and heating oil 
unions meeting sunday and monday voted to accept a government 
offer of wage increases said lucio pimentel spokesman for the 
petrobras state oil monopoly 
the strike by more than 50000 petroleum workers paralyzed the 
nations 11 refineries in emergency bargaining during the weekend 
the government offered strikers a 15 percent costofliving raise 
and a 4 percent raise tied to productivity 
oil workers earn about 300 a month good pay by brazilian 
standards 
petrobras also agreed not to punish strikers and to deduct only 
four days pay from their checks 
strike leaders urged unions to accept the offer although it fell 
short of the 266 percent raise they demanded 
the government had suspended the costofliving raise last year 
when it decreed a 90day price freeze officials said granting the 
raise would create more inflation now at an annual rate of more 
than 1000 percent 
it was a great political victory although economically it 
didnt attain what we wanted mauro costa of the national strike 
command said in brasilia 
during the strike the government was forced to import emergency 
shipments of diesel fuel cooking gas and kerosene when stocks 
threatened to run out completely gas rationing was imposed in some 
parts of the country 
brazil has suffered a recent wave of strikes caused by a 
sputtering economy under president jose sarney the strikers have 
included national park employees doctors and nurses at 
governmentrun clinics electricity workers subway personnel 
steelworkers and federal employees in at least 17 of 26 ministries

president reagan on monday helped 
break ground for the library that will house his white house papers 
saying he hoped historians and scholars would judge our efforts 
well 
this is a most humbling moment for me said reagan who will 
relinquish the presidency to george bush in 60 days the story 
that will be told inside the walls that are yet to be built here is 
the story not only of a presidency but of a movement 
the president and his wife nancy flew from washington to southern 
california to take part in the ceremonies for the ronald reagan 
presidential library the 153000squarefoot spanishstyle 
facility will be built on a 100acre site about 45 miles northwest 
of los angeles 
the reagans gave final approval to the site last summer after 
the president viewed the sweeping hilly area from a helicopter 
following a ground inspection by the first lady 
the selection of the simi valley site about 70 miles southeast 
of the reagans ranch in santa barbara county came after planners 
of the reagan library were thwarted in an attempt to build it at 
stanford university in palo alto calif 
appearing at the ceremony at the outset of a sixday thanksgiving 
vacation at his ranch in the santa ynez mountains reagan talked 
reflectively of his eight years as president 
the journey has not been just my own he said it seems i 
have been guided by a force much larger than myself a force made up 
of ideas and beliefs about what this country is and what it could 
be 
reagan takes credit for a resurgence of conservatism in america 
and much of the 1988 campaign rhetoric during the republican primary 
season was about what man could best carry on the reagan 
revolution 
this seachange was based on a fiscal policy at home aimed at 
stimulating economic growth through tax cuts and deregulation of 
business and a resurgence of us international influence brought 
about principally by a major military buildup projections of 
american power in the third world and warming if unsteady 
relations with the soviet union 
what this library will house is the record of ideas and 
policies that have undergirded our accomplishments reagan said 
there will be much to study here much to discuss much to mull 
over 
this library will allow scholars of the future to cast their 
own judgments on these years and i would not presume to predict the 
result of their researches he said but i have to believe that 
scholars of good will upon examining the historical record that 
will be contained herein will judge our efforts well 
but as for us at present we can only say this we have done 
our best and we pray that it has been enough 
the land for the library was donated by a los angeles development 
company blakeleyschwartz the selection sparked opposition by 
environmentalists initially because the site impinged on a greenbelt 
area protected from largescale development by a decadeold 
nonbinding agreement among simi valley moorpark and thousand oaks 
the 45 million library will be constructed with donations to the 
private ronald reagan library foundation it will sit in an area of 
rolling hills covered with brush beavertail cactus and wildflowers 
former attorney general william french smith told the audience 
that over 100000 people have contributed toward the librarys cost 
but he did not say how much of the money has been raised 
arrayed on the platform next to the reagans were several members 
of the board of trustees of the presidential library foundation 
including former attorney general edwin meese former national 
security adviser and interior secretary william clark former 
domestic policy adviser martin anderson and energy secretary john 
herrington 
after his brief speech reagan walked about 30 feet up a knoll 
and he and his wife each wielding stainless steel shovels that 
glistened in the bright sun turned the first shovelsful of dirt as 
more than 250 people applauded 
the building will include underground storage a museum and 
research materials depicting the administration and historical 
events during the reagan years 
as the curtain draws on the reagan presidency the first couple 
seems prepared for the transition back to private life they will 
move into a luxurious home in the bel air section of los angeles in 
january an estate that they will lease from friends who acquired 
the property in their behalf 
reagan has said he plans to lecture often on the mashed potato 
circuit and mrs reagan has said she will remain active in the 
campaign against drug abuse 
while in california this week aides said the president will act 
on various pieces of legislation passed by congress in its waning 
days last month 
following their usual pattern the reagans also will go horseback 
riding and the president will attend to ranch chores after their 
return to washington on sunday they will have a busy schedule of 
parties and other social commitments in their final weeks in the 
capital

a strike by editorial workers at the chicago 
suntimes was postponed monday when the newspapers management made 
a new contract proposal a suntimes official said 
brian fantl director of labor relations for the newspaper said 
a pay raise could be part of the offer but that an agreement with 
the federal mediator prevented him from revealing details of the 
proposal 
the proposal was taken to the unions executive committee and 
fantl said he expected a response later monday 
union representatives were at a meeting at the suntimes and were 
unavailable for comment 
as the strike deadline of 230 pm came and went both sides 
said they were prepared for a walkout which would be the first 
strike by editorial workers in the newspapers 40year history 
the picketline chants are all set and ready to go union 
spokesman dan lehmann the newspapers religion writer said earlier 
in the day picket signs and leaflets were printed and waiting he 
said 
suntimes spokesman michael soll said management did not want a 
strike but was fully prepared to produce a paper using company 
executives nonunion editors and outside writers 
at the rival chicago tribune a 40monthlong printers strike 
could end this week following the strikers overwhelming approval of 
a new threeyear contract but walkouts by mailers and pressmen at 
the newspaper continued 
the strike deadline at the suntimes was set by chicago newspaper 
guild local 71 which represents 250 reporters editors 
photographers and support staff the union has been working without 
a contract since june 1 
soll said company negotiators were willing to meet around the 
clock and he hoped an agreement could be reached at the meeting 
which began at 9 am monday 
a federal mediator william sigler was working with negotiators 
officials said 
there seems to be much less anguish and much more hope than 
in previous days soll said after talks resumed 
the guild has been seeking a 195 percent pay raise over three 
years prior to monday management had proposed a 3 percent salary 
cut for 18 months followed by a restoration of current pay levels 
for the remainder of the threeyear pact guild unit chairman thomas 
gibbons said 
starting reporters earn 625 weekly going up to 895 for 
reporters with five years experience 
in addition gibbons said differences remained over management 
proposals to cut night differential for workers by 40 percent and 
exempt eight senior editorial staffers from union jurisdiction 
soll said the paper is healthy financially but must control 
costs to remain competitive with the larger chicago tribune which 
has an estimated circulation of 765000 daily and 1117 million 
sunday 
the suntimes whose circulation is estimated at 605000 daily 
and 614000 on sunday was purchased from media baron rupert murdoch 
for 145 million in june 1986 by a group of investors led by the new 
york investment firm adler amp shaykin 
at the tribune members of local 16 of the chicago typographical 
union voted 18043 sunday to approve the new pact and an 856 
million settlement fund tribune president charles brumback has 
until thursday to decide whether to sign the agreement 
under its terms the 119 printers still on strike down from 240 
who walked out originally would have the option of a buyout or a 
lifetime annuity as well as receiving companypaid medical 
coverage about 50 printers who went back to work under a 1986 
unconditional offer to return can stay on at the paper under terms 
of the threeyear contract which includes pay increases or they 
can accept a 30000 cash buyout

news reports said monday 
ms onassis 37 who died saturday of what an autopsy report 
described as acute pulmonary edema was a frequent visitor to the 
argentine capital she was in the city for four days in late october 
and returned again on nov 9 
her visits were motivated by her close friendship with marina and 
alberto dodero members of a wealthy argentine family that had long 
been associated with ms onassis late father shipping tycoon 
aristotle onassis 
that friendship may have extended to a romantic interest in mrs 
doderos brother jorge tchomlekdjoglou 43 buenos aires newspapers 
suggested monday

hotel in the heart of la recoleta one of citys most exclusive

weekend home said mercedes zavalia public relations director for

change shortly before 11 am 
ms onassis took overly long in emerging from the bathroom where 
she was changing her friend went to look for her and found her 
lying on the bathroom floor the cousin told reporters 
a conflicting version was published monday by the buenos aires 
newspaper clarin which cited dodero family attorney juan carlos 
macdonald as saying the heiress died in her sleep at the dodero home 
family members discounted the possibility that ms onassis could 
have committed suicide 
a happy person could never commit suicide and christina was 
content and very happy mary onassis an aunt told reporters 
she had no apparent health problems 
mary onassis told reporters that her niece planned to attend a

the aging state airplane that had to make an 
emergency landing with gov mario cuomo aboard ran into problems 
again monday when pilots decided not to take it up because they 
didnt like the way it was handling 
department of environmental conservation pilots had been planning 
to fly the grumman gulfstream g1 from an airport near 
mountoursville pa where it made the emergency landing sunday to 
an aviation company in wilmington del said department spokesman 
rw groneman 
when the turboprop taxied onto the runway for takeoff the pilots 
decided to return it to the hangar 
they didnt feel comfortable taking it up said groneman who 
couldnt say what the pilots didnt like about the way the plane was 
functioning 
the plane the largest in the states fleet had been set to fly 
to atlantic aviations maintenance center where the 22yearold 
aircraft underwent a 628000 overhaul in 1987 
earlier monday the craft had been inspected by two officials 
from the federal aviation administration said faa spokeswoman 
kathleen bergin in queens she said she didnt know whether the 
federal inspectors had determined why the plane malfunctioned 
cuomo speaking to reporters monday tried to play down the 
seriousness of sundays mishap and said regardless of the planes 
fate the state cannot afford a replacement it would cost 12 
million to 13 million to buy an airplane of comparable size to the 
17passenger g1 
how could we buy a new plane with all of the problems we 
have said the governor whose state is facing a deficit estimated 
at nearly 2 billion 
you should ground the governor before you spend 13 million on 
a new plane he said 
when the plane had problems previously cuomo said he would use 
smaller planes to travel within the state and take commercial 
flights on longer trips if it couldnt be repaired 
cuomo insisted that the plane remains basically sound despite 
having to make three emergency landings in the past 16 months twice 
with the governor on board 
its not a dramatic threat to anybody he said if it were 
we wouldnt be on the plane and if they tell me its a dramatic 
threat then i wont be on the plane

a panel considering president mikhail s 
gorbachevs plans for change recommends curtailing the power of a 
new national council in response to accusations that the kremlin 
concentrates too much power in moscow 
pravda the communist party daily said monday the commission of 
the supreme soviet recommended dropping language that gives the new 
council of peoples deputies the power to reject laws adopted by 
legislatures of the 15 soviet republics 
the commission is reviewing constitutional amendments to be 
considered by the national parliament next week 
proposed amendments designed to reorganize the governing 
apparatus hve generated considerable opposition particularly in the 
independenceminded baltic republics but also in letters published 
by the soviet press 
in one manifestation of recent demands for more authonomy 
thousands of lithuanians chanting for shame jammed the center 
of vilnius capital of lithuania on monday to protest their 
legislatures refusal to declare the republics autonomy from 
moscow residents said 
the supreme soviet commission in a saturday meeting that was the 
subject of pravdas report monday also suggested changing language 
that authorizes new council to decide the composition of the soviet 
union its constituent republics and autonomus regions 
a dispatch from tass the official news agency said the 
presidium of the supreme soviet of the russian federation the 
largest republic denounced the estonian action as a contradiction 
of the basic principles of socialist federalism 
as proposed by the kremlin leadership the amendment empowers the 
council of peoples deputies to take decisions relative to the 
composition of the ussr the approval of the formation of new 
autonomous republics and autonomous regions in the composition of 
the union republics 
according to pravda the commission suggested limiting the 
council to matters on the questions of nationalstate structure 
relative to the jurisdiction of the ussr 
it said changes recommended by the commission were part of an 
effort to increase the development of the sovereign rights of the 
republics 
just how far those sovereign rights go is a subject of 
dispute between estonia one of the three baltic republics and 
central authorities in moscow 
last week the estonian legislature adopted a declaration of 
sovereignty giving the republic veto power over soviet laws and 
proclaiming onceindependent estonias power in all matters except 
defense and foreign policy 
although the supreme soviet commission sought to limit the power 
of the new council it also condemned the estonian legislatures 
action on grounds that giving laws of a republic authority over 
national statutes violates the 1977 soviet constitution 
the presidium the supreme soviet executive body has said it 
will review estonias action and has summoned estonian leaders to 
moscow to explain 
gorbachevs initial personal reaction to developments in the 
baltics was mild he said during a visits to india such actions were 
an exercise of perestroika his program to reform the political 
and economic system 
constitutional amendments proposed by gorbachev have caused a 
furor in lithuania and estonia and and to a lesser degree in 
latvia because they are seen as limiting the powers of the 
republics as the baltics seek greater control over their own affairs 
they are part of his political restructuring which includes 
creation of a more powerful presidency and a fulltime national 
legislature 
in vilnius on monday the lithuanian movement for perestroika 
called a 10minute protest at noon that a spokeswoman said halted 
traffic in the downtown area

two african national congress 
members were convicted of treason monday in connection with two mine 
explosions and a swazi codefendant was found guilty of terrorism 
ebrahim ismail ebrahim a senior member of the outlawed anc and a 
founding member of its military wing was abducted from swaziland in 
december 1986 and held in solitary confinement until may 1987 when 
he was charged with treason 
he and anc member simon dladla were found guilty monday in 
pretoria supreme court in connection with mine explosions last year 
in the transvaal towns of volksrust and breyten 
the trial had been controversial because of ebrahims abduction 
from swaziland by men he identified as south african police the 
defense argued in a separate hearing that south african courts had 
no jurisdiction to try ebrahim 
adriaan vlok the law and order minister would not comment on 
whether ebrahim had been abducted but said no south african 
policemen were involved if he was kidnapped 
although the explosions occurred after ebrahim was in custody 
the state contended that he was responsible because it said he 
coordinated and planned anc military operations from swaziland 
ebrahim left south africa in 1979 after completing a 15year 
prison term for various acts of sabotage 
the judge said codefendant anton mandla maseko could not be 
found guilty of treason because as a swazi citizen he did not owe 
allegiance to south africa he was convicted of terrorism 
the three men are to be sentenced later

george bush was advised to make vigorous use of the new powers that 
congress has given the president to get satisfaction from other 
countries in trade disputes 
the advice came from the general accounting office which has 
prepared a series of brief reports on important issues for the 
transition to the new presidency which begins on jan 20 
a report on trade released monday said the office had found many 
instances when a followup was needed to get the benefits of an 
international trade agreement it added that delaying tactics and 
slow dispute settlements have often frustrated efforts to get 
satisfaction but the new trade act strengthens the us hand 
failure to gain timely satisfaction can now trigger a 
unilateral us response the report said 
the new administration should show strong resolve to vigorously 
use these new powers 
the report was submitted by comptroller general charles a 
bowsher the head of the office to congress and to the us trade 
representative designate bush has not yet appointed a successor 
to yeutter who is expected to leave with reagans administration 
which goes out of office jan 20 
the report does not specify which new powers it means other 
governments have said they were worried that the president now has 
additional power to protect us industry against competiion one 
new provision of the new law permits him to specify what he 
considers high priority unfair trade practises and to start action 
toward retaliation while trying to get a settlement by negotiation 
another provision permits him to rule that a country denying 
internationally recognized rights to labor can be considered as 
engaging in an unfair trade practise and to retaliate against its 
trade 
the gao complained of defects in efforts to promote us exports 
it said the commerce department has chosen questionable trade 
promotion events and has been active in countries with little or no 
potential for buying more us goods it did not specify the 
countries 
it criticized as largely symbolic the controls put on exports 
to further us foreign policy objectives as distinct from controls 
which have security objectives 
when these controls are symbolic they do not prevent the 
targeted country from getting the controlled products from other 
countries the report said 
instead their costs are borne by american businesses in the 
form of export sales lost to firms in other countries 
the report did not specify either the countries targeted by the 
us controls or their suppliers one country where us exports 
are controlled because of us foreign policy is south africa where 
japanese and west european suppliers have replaced many exports that 
can now no longer be shppied by americans

president hosni mubarak appeared with plo 
leader yasser arafat at a joint news conference on monday and 
advised israel to be careful in its reaction to egypts recognition 
of the newly proclaimed palestinian state 
mubaraks remark came the day after egyptian recognition and he 
entertained the palestine liberation organization chairman at a 
state dinner and a threehour session of separate and enlarged talks 
israel should be precise in its statements and should know that 
we also want peace mubarak said 
all the people in the region including the israeli people 
want peace 
the news conference was carried by the stateowned middle east 
news agency 
mubarak was apparently responding to reported israeli threats to 
delay an israeli withdrawal from disputed taba beach israel refused 
to return taba to egypt when israel withdrew from sinai in 1982 but 
an international arbitration team ruled two months ago that the area 
belonged to egypt 
an israeli government official said in jerusalem monday that 
israels 10member inner cabinet will discuss egypts move at a 
session wednesday and will debate such a possibility 
mubarak was also referring to israeli accusations that egypt 
violated the usbrokered 1978 camp david peace accords which 
produced the first peace treaty between israel and egypt but failed 
to grant any sort of autonomy to the 15 million palestinians in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
arafat flew into cairo from baghdad iraq on monday and said he 
and mubarak will discuss a common approach to a mideast peace 
conference 
in jerusalem israeli foreign minister shimon peres on monday 
summoned egyptian ambassador mohammed bassiouny and expressed 
israels regret over cairos recognition of the palestinian state a 
ministry official said 
the official said peres told bassiouny the move violated 
israeliegyptian treaties that call for the final status of the west 
bank and gaza strip to be negotiated in peace talks bassiouny told 
peres that recognition did not violate egypts agreements with 
israel he reported 
wearing his usual military fatigues and black checked scarf 
arafat spoke briefly to reporters at the airport before leaving with 
foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid in a mercedes benz flying the 
egyptian and palestinian flags 
it was the first time in cairo that the plo flag flew on an 
official car an honor normally reserved for heads of state and 
ambassadors 
however there were no red carpets military bands or other 
trappings of a head of states arrival 
i am really happy to be here especially after the declaration 
of a palestinian state by the palestine national council the 
plos parliament arafat said 
i can brief my brothers headed by president hosni mubarak on 
the details of the pnc and draw a common visualization of effective 
steps for the promotion of an international middle east peace 
conference 
since the palestinian state was declared nov 15 in algiers 
arafat has flown to morocco mauritania back to algeria and to iraq 
to drum up support for future peace moves 
the palestinian council declaration did not define the boundaries 
of its new state but implied it meant the west bank and gaza strip 
which israel captured from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east 
war the declaration said jerusalem would be the capital of the 
palestinian state 
palestinian sources in baghdad said monday that arafat urged arab 
ambassadors there to press the united states to grant him a visa so 
he can address the un general assembly 
the israeli official in jerusalem said egypts bassiouny told 
peres at their 40minute meeting that egypt viewed the plos 
conditional acceptance of un security council resolution 242 as a 
recognition of israel 
the resolution adopted after the 1967 war calls on israel to 
withdraw from captured territory but also asserts the right of all 
countries in the region to live in secure borders 
egypt is the third country which has diplomatic relations with 
israel to recognize the declared palestinian state the others are 
turkey and cyprus

us rep robert garcia and his wife were 
indicted monday on bribery extortion and conspiracy charges in the 
wedtech corruption scandal accused among other things of accepting 
a diamondandemerald necklace from the companys founder 
garcia 55 and his wife jane lee garcia 48 were accused of 
extorting 76000 in payments from wedtech corp as well as a 
20000 interestfree loan from onetime wedtech vice chairman mario 
moreno 
in addition the garcias were accused of taking 77500 and the 
necklace from wedtech founder john mariotta and his wife jennie in 
1985 
none of the payments the loan or the jewelry was reported on 
garcias congressional financial disclosure forms in 1984 and 1985 
according to the sevencount indictment 
attorney ralph vallone jr 41 of santurce puerto rico was 
accused of funneling 86100 in wedtech payments through his law 
office to mrs garcia as consulting fees passing on 76000 and 
keeping 10100 for himself 
wedtech now out of business was a tiny south bronx machine shop 
that grew into a multimiliondollarayear defense contractor 
through a small business administration program that allowed 
minorityowned firms to obtain government contracts without 
competitive bidding 
vallone and the garcias face a maxium penalty of up to 20 years 
in prison and 250000 in fines if convicted of extortion the most 
serious charge they all face maximum penalties of two to 15 years 
in prison on additional charges of conspiracy bribe receiving and 
receipt of an illegal gratuity 
they are to be arraigned dec 1 
garcia mariotta and moreno met with the governor of puerto rico 
in 1985 the indictment said although the governor was not accused 
of any wrongdoing 
the indictment charged that on aug 2 1985 garcia met with 
moreno in his bronx congressional office and allegedly directed the 
wedtech executive to make the 20000 loan through garcias sister 
the rev aimee cortese 
this was done the indictment said so that it would falsely 
appear that aimee cortese not mario moreno was the source of the 
loan 
ms cortese was pastor of the cross road tabernacle 
the loan was repaid in two 10000 payments the indictment said 
neither garcia nor his attorney robert morvillo was available 
for comment but garcia issued a statement through spokesman bill 
danvers 
i am grateful that this period of trial by grand jury leaks is 
finally over the statement said i note that despite an 
investigation which has lasted nearly two years and has scrutinized 
virtually every facet of my personal and professional life the 
charges deal only with the preposterous allegations of mario moreno 
one of the most notorious felons of the 20th century 
moreno was one of four wedtech officials who pleaded guilty to 
bribing government authorities and cooperated with prosecutors in 
several earlier wedtech cases 
moreno testified earlier this year at the trial of former us 
rep mario biaggi dbronx that the company had paid 80000 to 
garcia 
the payments for political favors and political 
introductions allegedly were made to garcia because he and his 
wife requested it said moreno 
moreno also testified about numerous alleged payoffs to bankers 
businessmen union officials and a public utility manager 
the overall wedtech investigation is still continuing said 
us attorney rudolph giuliani 
giuliani would not say what garcia allegedly did in return for 
the payments saying he could not go beyond the language of the 
indictment which did not specify further 
through his spokesman garcia said he was innocent and vowed to 
fight the charges with all of my godgiven strength 
garcia was reelected earlier this month despite continuing 
rumors that he would face corruption charges 
on friday biaggi another bronx democrat was sentenced to eight 
years in prison for his part in the wedtech scandal 
mariotta wedtechs founder once described by president reagan 
as one of the heroes for the 80s was among those convicted of 
racketeering with biaggi at least 19 people have been convicted in 
the case to date

tropical storm keith just short of becoming the 
years sixth hurricane soaked the yucatan peninsula on monday and 
moved into the gulf of mexico on a course expected to veer toward 
florida forecasters said 
its a strong tropical storm on the borderline of a 
hurricane said bob sheets director of the national hurricane 
center 
keiths top sustained winds were hovering at about 65 mph sheets 
said 74 mph is the threshold for a storm to be upgraded to a 
hurricane 
at 8 pm est the storm was centered near latitude 231 north 
and longitude 870 west about 400 miles southwest of fort myers 
fla forecasters said keith was moving north at less than 10 mph and 
was expected to turn east in the next 12 to 24 hours 
its moving toward the north out in the southcentral gulf 
said sheets the highest probability of landfall is the middle 
of floridas west coast late in the week 
but sheets emphasized that keith is unlikely to become a storm on 
the order of gilbert or joan which devastated wide areas of the 
caribbean and central america in september and october 
i think itll be just barely a hurricane he said 
on monday the storms rains soaked an area from mexico across 
western cuba to the florida keys but spared the yucatan peninsula 
city of cancun from major damage according to alejandro alvarado 
general manager of the sheraton hotel there 
i just went around and you can see two or three things down on 
the main street he said theres lots of water lots of 
puddles 
alvarado said two or three light poles apparently ones that were 
being installed to replace those knocked down during gilbert and 
werent yet firmly in place had blown over a few new palms fell as 
well he said hotels wee not be evacuated 
the resort town is still recovering from gilbert which caused 
extensive damage in september 
while still a tropical depression keith passed south of jamaica 
late friday and early saturday pouring almost 4 inches of rain on 
kingston in 24 hours it also dumped rain on honduras before heading 
north into the gulf 
tropical depressions are upgraded to tropical storms when their 
top sustained winds reach 39 mph keith reached that status sunday 
keith is the 11th named storm of the 1988 atlantic hurricane 
season which runs from may 1 to nov 30 five of the storms reached 
hurricane strength but only gilbert and joan did major damage

at a meeting where more than 20 percent 
of the leadership was ousted the central council of the hungarian 
trade unions said monday it no longer automatically supports 
government austerity measures 
while duly respecting independent government decisions it 
said in a statement the unions will not assume responsibility 
for them not actually having participated in that decisionmaking 
process 
the central council which has a membership of about 220 ousted 
45 council members and appointed 37 new members the state news 
agency mti reported the meeting defined the fundamental tasks of 
trade unions as protecting and representing the specific interests 
of workers 
reorganization and the change in basic policy were seen as a 
reaction to an increasing trend toward installing new independent 
unions in communist hungary a spinoff development of economic and 
social reforms here 
mti said the central council demanded that the government follow 
a firm antiinflation policy and called for earliest implementation 
of wage reform 
living standards have fallen for months mainly because of price 
increases and a new tax system and inflation is running at about 16 
percent 
on the central councils list of basic issues to be discussed 
with the government at their next session nov 28 are living 
standards including real wages and income employment and social 
policy the agency said 
speakers at the council meeting were said to have stressed that 
the government must declare a partnership with unions as befits 
discussions between equal partners 
some speakers not identified by mti said it was not true that 
the trade union movement had lost the confidence of workers but 
admitted that some individuals some measures and certain methods 
have shaken the confidence of the membership 
it said said some speakers denounced as shocking unspecified 
curbs on trade union rights there was no elaboration

a double murderer who escaped from a 153yearold prison in new 
jersey by chipping through his cell and using a handmade ladder to 
scale a wall was recaptured monday following a daylong search 
in california four inmates who escaped from a jail with a rope 
made of knotted bed sheets were still at large and in new york 
city three foreign nationals who tried to break out of federal 
custody were captured early monday on a rainsoaked parapet of the 
prison 
in trenton gonzalo marrero 37 was caught about three blocks 
from the prison some 14 hours after his escape 
search crews had used helicopters and rifletoting officers 
stood guard at blockaded streets while others went door to door in 
some neighborhoods police also had stopped all new jersey transit 
trains in the early morning 
marrero had scaled the prisons outer wall about 4 am using a 
rickety handmade 19foot ladder two other inmates apparently 
trying to escape with him had not yet climbed the ladder when they 
were spotted by a tower guard officials said 
the three inmates apparently had chipped away at the wall of 
their groundlevel cell for some time probably for several weeks 
said james stabile a spokesman for the state department of 
corrections 
they were housed in the prisons oldest section built in 1835 
and once they chipped through the concrete they were able to push a 
stone out of the wall he said 
marrero was serving at least 60 years for the slayings of two 
people killed during a restaurant holdup in union city he also was 
convicted of related sexual assault robbery and burglary charges 
said stabile 
in santa ana calif authorities were searching for four inmates 
who escaped from the orange county jail 
authorities were tipped to the escape about 8 pm sunday when a 
santa ana resident reported seeing a man in a prison jumpsuit about 
a block away from the jail said sheriffs lt richard olson 
the four inmates were part of a recreation group meeting on the 
jail roof who cut a small hole in the security fence and scaled down 
the wall using the bedsheet rope he said 
and in new york federal investigators were trying to find out 
how the foreign nationals got the hacksaw blade they used to saw 
through the bars and plastic window of an eighthfloor room 
they apparently used twine to drop to a fourthfloor setback of 
the building said us marshal romolo j imundi 
marshals using a fire department cherry picker got the 
prisoners down

for someone with a reputation as a conciliator 
prime minister brian mulroney certainly loves a good fight 
he likes to portray himself as a statesman and canadas most 
competent leader but he thrives on oldfashioned politicking 
mulroney appeared headed for another term in mondays election 
the first time since 1953 that a canadian leader was able to put 
together consecutive majority governments 
it was a slimmer margin this time than in 1984 when he led his 
progressive conservative party to one of the most impressive 
landslides in canadian history 
the 49yearold prime minister comes from a working class family 
in baiecomeau on the north shore of quebecs st lawrence he was 
ambitious and built a successful legal and corporate career in 
montreal 
he first tried for the conservative party leadership in 1976 but 
was not successful until 1983 he also was first elected to the 
house of commons that year 
mulroney is the first bilingual native of quebec to lead his 
party and he has used that fact skillfully in expanding the 
conservatives base in that critical largely frenchspeaking 
province 
support for cronies was charged during his first years in office 
dropping his popularity drastically in the public opinion polls 
eight cabinet ministers resigned in separate incidents but by 
the time he called the election oct 1 mulroney had distanced 
himself from the controversies and was able to point to an 
experienced management team 
he planned to stage the campaign on competency and the prosperity 
that lasted through his term to create 13 million jobs in canada 
that all changed midway through the race when the free trade 
agreement with the united states took off as the no 1 issue 
turning the campaign into an emotional tide that for a time appeared 
to be sinking mulroney 
he emerged from the protective cover of statesman to stage a 
hard direct fight 
by the campaigns closing days mulroney was exuberantly telling 
crowds at his rallies that they had a choice between opposition 
liberal party john turner the ripper or brian the builder 
he described the opponents of the trade agreement he signed last 
january with president reagan as jittery negative defenders of past 
traditions that could not survive in the modern world 
mulroney by contrast saw himself as a nation builder ready 
to lead a competent canada into full competition with the much 
larger and more powerful united states 
the phrase surfaced in the last of six hours of debate last 
month when turner accused the prime minister of selling out canada 
with the free trade agreement 
mulroney replied that he carried through on the agreement to 
build canada ust as his father had gone to northeastern quebec 55 
years ago where he and hundreds of other laborers built a small town 
i believe that in my own modest way i am nation building 
because i believe this benefits canada and i love canada the 
prime minister said 
although turner was widely believed to be the winner of the 
debate the momentum did not carry through to the end of the 
campaign 
the prime minister is a roman catholic he is married and has 
four children

two fire inspectors resigned and a third was 
suspended over shoddy handling of documents concerning an 
ashland oil inc diesel fuel spill in january a police official 
said monday 
allegheny county police superintendent robert kroner said the 
county fire marshals office failed to properly review ashlands 
plans to reassemble a storage tank that collapsed jan 2 in nearby 
jefferson and spilled about 750000 gallons of fuel into the 
monongahela river 
kroner said detectives also found that secret internal documents 
concerning the tank were released to outsiders he would not name 
fire marshal martin jacobs 38 and chief inspector charles 
kelly 58 resigned after meeting with kroner on friday kroner said 
deputy fire marshal edward babyak 52 refused kroners offer to 
resign and has been suspended pending action by the allegheny county 
commissioners kroner said 
our investigation revealed some procedural mistakes some work 
actions that were not conducive to running a good fire marshals 
office and some other items that we dont want to discuss at this 
time kroner said 
county solicitor james dodaro said the action against the three 
officials has no bearing on whether the oil company followed proper 
procedures in the reconstruction of the storage tank 
dodaro said the company never received nor paid for a certificate 
of approval to build the tank 
kroner began investigating the fire marshals office on oct 14 
after he said babyak produced a copy of a memorandum regarding the 
tank during legal depositions that were part of ashland oils 
defense in a federal lawsuit 
since soon after the spill jacobs and his staff maintained that 
they knew of no memo or any other correspondence giving ashland 
approval to rebuild the tank 
on oct 14 according to kroner ashland oil attorneys had 
possession of the fire marshals internal memo which never should 
have been disclosed to anyone outside county law enforcement offices 
kroner said the memo claims that kelly had inspected the area of 
the tank looked at some aerial photos of the tank farm and had 
approved the beginning or start of the project 
ashland oil has claimed it had approval to rebuild the tank on 
the site 
thats semantics but it will be argued in court kroner 
said up until these people left the fire marshals office they 
still denied they gave verbal approval 
kroner said jacobs had denied the existence of the internal memo 
until last thursday when he admitted he found the original in his 
desk on nov 3

the general assembly is ready to demand a 
worldwide end to colonialism and to condemn south africas rule of 
southwest africa 
the assembly appears certain to approve a resolution tuesday 
declaring the 1990s to be the international decade for the 
eradication of colonialism it also will probably pass a resolution 
denouncing south africas control of southwest africa or namibia 
last year a resolution calling for namibian independence passed 
1312 with seven abstentions only the united states and britain 
voted against it 
south africa was stripped of its voting rights in the general 
assembly in 1974 
when the united nations was established in 1945 750 million 
people lived without selfgovernment in territories dependent on 
colonial powers by 1985 fewer than 3 million people still lived in 
such territories 
talks are under way to grant independence to namibias 15 
million residents and western saharas 117000 
a tentative accord reached last week among south africa cuba and 
angola paves the way for south africa to grant independence to 
namibia with the oneyear transition possibly beginning early next 
year cuba would remove its troops from angola where it is 
supporting the marxist government against us and south 
africanbacked rebels 
south africa has ruled namibia since it took the former german 
colony during world war i 
the united nations also is mediating peace talks on the western 
sahara between morocco which occupies most of the northwest african 
territory and the polisario independence movement fighting the 
moroccan army 
under a tentative agreement about 2000 un peacekeepers would 
monitor a referendum that would result in western saharas 
independence or affiliation with morocco 
less likely to be decolonized is the former portugese colony of 
east timor indonesia invaded the 550000resident island in 1975 
britain continues to claim the falkland islands insisting that 
the 1800 falkland residents wish to remain subjects of britain 
argentina also claims the islands and the two nations fought a war 
over their possession in 1982 
puerto rico was removed from the un list of nonselfgoverning 
territories in 1952 when it adopted a constitution and status as a 
us commonwealth

britains traditional leadership of un 
diplomatic efforts in the arabisraeli conflict ended monday with a 
reshuffle of senior posts in the world body an official said 
un spokeswoman nadia younes announced structural changes 
taking effect immediately transferring undersecretarygeneral 
marrack gouldings responsibility for arabisraeli problems directly 
to secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
goulding a briton will head the office of special political 
affairs with responsibility solely for all peacekeeping operations 
except for un military observers in afghanistan and pakistan 
the changes end britains longstanding portfolio for 
arabisraeli affairs at the united nations under which british 
officials at the united nations conducted most diplomacy in the 
region 
under the reorganization perez de cuellar is taking more direct 
control over diplomacy and arrangment of peace accords and 
delegating the implementation of those arrangements to senior 
officials 
the first major step in that direction came in june and july when 
perez de cuellar took charge of ceasefire negotiations between iran 
and iraq 
the un mediation of the afghan accords were conducted by diego 
cordovez of ecuador who received credit for that settlement 
ms younes said the secretarygeneral is making the changes in 
response to the increasing demand for his good offices in the 
maintenance of international peace and security and for united 
nations peacekeeping operations 
she refused to characterize the shuffle as a promotion or 
demotion for anyone involved 
goulding will also be in charge of the planning and conduct of 
future peacekeeping operations a formidable task with several 
potential new missions on the horizon

utility officials originated the idea for 
the executive order president reagan signed giving the federal 
government broad powers in nuclear power plant emergency planning a 
top executive of the stalled seabrook nuclear project said monday 
there had been reports the order originated within the department 
of energy as well as speculation that new hampshire gov john 
sununu a staunch seabrook advocate whom presidentelect george 
bush last week named his chief of staff had a hand in conceiving 
the idea sununu had denied it 
john eichorn chairman of the seabrook joint owners committee 
said neither the energy department nor sununu came up with the 
proposal 
im sure it was the utility people eichorn said in an 
interview at seabrook after a news conference by nuclear regulatory 
commission chairman lando zech 
zech said seabrook could receive a lowpower license by christmas 
if questions about plant owners finances are resolved but he 
indicated he considers that a big if zech noted that lead owner 
public service company of new hampshire is under bankruptcy 
protection 
an nrc rule says plant finances do not have to be investigated 
before a license is issued utility officials said they believed 
zech signaled that he personally favors waiving that rule although 
he made no clear statement on a waiver 
a draft of the presidential order surfaced in june sparking an 
outcry from seabrook foes and some supporters too new hampshires 
allrepublican congressional delegation whose four members 
conditionally support seabrook met with reagan this summer and 
asked him not to sign the proposal 
but late friday reagan signed a revised version of the order 
which requires the federal emergency management agency to carry out 
nuclear plant evacuation plans when state or local governments 
refuse to cooperate 
the order appears aimed primarily at seabrook and the shoreham 
plant on new yorks long island both of which are completed but 
stalled because of government opposition to evacuation plans in 
seabrooks case the opposition comes from neighboring 
massachusetts which has six communities within seabrooks 10mile 
emergency planning zone 
asked for details on how the order came to be signed in its final 
form eichorn said we were cut out of that process six to 
nine months ago and frankly i dont know where its been in the 
meantime 
asked then what role seabrook officials had in the order eichorn 
said we were interested in having it conceived 
i dont like taking the whole credit but we certainly were 
involved in originating the proposal eichorn said he said 
shoreham officials also were involved 
zech meanwhile told reporters he had not seen the order and was 
not sure how it could help seabrook 
also on monday govelect judd gregg said he takes sununu at his 
word that he was not involved in getting reagan to sign the order 
during the weekend gregg suggested it was no coincidence that 
reagan signed the order the day after sununu was named the next 
white house chief of staff but sununu flatly denied any involvement 
i take him at his word gregg said

sentiment and old times sake probably wont 
cut any ice at cbs when it comes to dick van dykes and mary tyler 
moores new shows 
cbs after all is the network that dumped franks place oe 
of the most critically praised series in recent years 
ratings did in franks place and probably will be the undoing 
of the van dyke show and moores annie mcguire the shows 
which play backtoback on wednesday night were in the bottom 10 in 
the nielsens last week 
the only ratings hits so far this fall season are abcs 
roseanne and nbcs empty nest and dear john all three 
have been in the top 10 
roseanne starring roseanne barr and john goodman as a 
bluecollar husband and wife is already pressing nbcs the cosby 
show for the top spot 
cbs murphy brown starring candice bergen in her series 
debut as a star reporter on a tv newsmagazine got a middling 147 
rating for its premiere last week about half what cosby usually 
gets but respectable enough 
the murphy brown rating was a considerable improvement over 
its leadin coming of age which got an 115 rating that same 
night but it wasnt as high as designing women which got to 
153 
each rating point represents 904000 homes with televisions 
murphy brown is funny and bergen has a flair for comedy she 
plays a megatalent on the cusp of burnout the show takes some 
satiric swipes at television such as its penchant for turning 
glamorous airheads into reporters and giving executive positions to 
people who only recently stopped sleeping in pajamas with feet in 
them 
but van dyke and moore got off to slow starts not only in the 
ratings but with the critics as well 
van dyke teams with son barry in the van dyke show as a 
famous hoofer who comes to the rescue of his sons ailing theater in 
a small pennsylvania town the show combines domestic comedy in the 
sons home with the doings at the theater 
the premise is a great excuse for the elder van dyke to display 
his physical comedy and take a few pratfalls and the show has grown 
funnier episode by episode in a recent show van dykes grandson 
writes a school paper naming his grandfather as his favorite person 
because hes so much fun van dyke tries to live up to his 
grandsons expectations while barry feels rejected 
moore plays a widow with a teenage son who marries a widower 
with a teenage son and a younger daughter in a yours mine and 
ours kind of domestic comedy but moore also brings along a mother 
who supports every leftwing radical cause that comes along while 
new husband nick mcguire denis arndt has a father who would 
consider william f buckley a liberal 
annie mcguire hit its stride in the third show in which the 
sister of nicks late wife shows up it turns out theyd once had an 
affair which annie worms out of him consummated in a guard shack 
atop the brooklyn bridge the show ends with a night shot of the 
bridge and romantic cooing by nick and annie inside the guard shack 
the pairing of van dyke and moore on wednesdays probably sounded 
good on paper after all they were once americas favorite married 
couple on the dick van dyke show in the 1960s moores own the 
mary tyler moore show in the 1970s was a classic 
the problem is that neither has had a hit show in a long time a 
whole generation of dialtwisters has grown up not really knowing 
who they are except through reruns 
if neither ever makes another appearance however their place in 
televisions pantheon is assured the dick van dyke show and 
the mary tyler moore show rank among the best television series 
ever made neither has to prove anything

staying in touch is what the feelies are all 
about 
with their audience and with their music 
id rather appeal to 500 people for the right reasons than 
5000 for the wrong reasons its really what you mean to people 
group member glenn mercer said 
as for their music mercer said were reducing it to its basic 
element pure energy and spirit no intellect involved at all 
really 
you dont want to make it seem that its really being thought 
about you dont write a song about people being fascinated it just 
sort of comes out of you no preconceived ideas 
on their third album only life the feelies stick to the 
same unfettered approach the lyrics are terse like telegrams 
every word counts the singing is deliberately flat stripped of all 
emotion and irony the listener is left to wonder if such words as 
nothing matters and what if it did are to be taken at face 
value or a criticism of that attitude 
all of our songs are open to interpretation mercer said 
id much prefer that to saying what the songs about i think you 
failed in a way if you have to say what a songs about it really 
takes away something from the song 
the arrangements keep to the basic rock n roll combination of 
drums bass and guitars mercer said the feelies were attracted to 
the stooges the modern lovers and the mc5 groups more interested 
in emotion than fancy chord structures 
it was a combination one being that theyre pretty simple 
bands they gave you the feeling you didnt have to take years of 
music lessons didnt have to buy really expensive equipment you 
could make music on a personal level another thing they were cult 
bands nobody else knew about them 
bill million who cowrites the feelies songs with mercer liked 
the spontaneous feel of those groups 
the music had a lot of energy he said the stooges sounded 
like the guitar player just got a fender a fuzz box and an 
amplifier for christman and just recorded the album two weeks 
later 
but that changed in the 70s 
then it got away from that bands like emerson lake and palmer 
and yes just the opposite really 
the feelies were high school students in haledon nj when the 
group was formed in 1976 the original lineup consisted of mercer 
and million on guitars dave weckerman on drums and percussion and 
john j on bass 
they made their debut at manchester high school in haledon the 
following year not too successfully million remembered 
the audience wasnt getting into what we were doing between 
breaks they asked us if they could use the instruments and play 
stuff the audience actually wanted to hear then we started playing 
cbgbs and maxs kansas city 
and then the feelies caught on in 1978 they were called the 
best underground band in new york in a village voice cover story 
our audience went from about 12 to 600 people million 
recalled 
it seemed like a perfect fit when the feelies signed with stiff 
records and released their debut album crazy rhythms in 1980 
here was the best underground band and the ultimate new wave 
record label the home of elvis costello graham parker and nick 
lowe 
the feelies found out however that stiff had the same priority 
as the major record companies the bottom line 
they lectured us on how to write a hit single it was like a 
scene out of a movie mercer said 
there were no hit singles and despite excellent reviews crazy 
rhythms was a commercial failure and the feelies disbanded in 
1981 not because they wanted to mercer noted 
we didnt anticipate not playing for that long the gigs got 
further and further apart we werent thinking in turns of a 
finality we tend to go where things lead we got involved in doing 
different things not wanting to get involved with another bad 
experience 
but the feelies were not forgotten film director jonathan demme 
had seen the band play at the whiskey a go go in los angeles and 
suggested that mercer and million write the soundtrack for susan 
seidelmans smithereens released in 1982 
he was a fan of the band we kept in touch million said 
the feelies regrouped in 1983 with brenda sauter on bass stanley 
demeski on drums and weckerman moving to percussion in 1986 they 
released the good earth on coyote records 
the same year the feelies appeared in demmes hit film 
something wild performing a cover of the monkees im a 
believer at a high school reunion 
it was fun a lot of hard work but primarily fun they made us 
comfortable mercer said 
but the feelies are not looking to be a fun band theyre not 
interested in being fashionable they seek connection with their 
fans through music 
the people there are just there for the music its not like 
going to the disco and getting dressed and making the scene 
mercer said 
added million there isnt a scene to make

in the past decade seven south american 
nations pried themselves loose from the dictatorial grip of military 
men 
the march of freedom seemed inexorable 
for the 210 million people in the seven nations ecuador peru 
bolivia argentina uruguay brazil and suriname the return of 
elected civilian government brought substantial personal freedom and 
the restoration of human rights 
now the bright shining shield of democracy is becoming tarnished 
growing disenchantment is evident in several countries mostly 
because of dashed expectations that an end to political repression 
would bring economic improvement it hasnt proved that simple 
nonetheless democracy continues to enjoy substantial allure 
spreading into the few remaining enclaves of authoritarian rule 
chiles citizenry rallying behind the slogan the joy is 
coming voted to end gen augusto pinochets 15year tenure as 
president and hold elections in december 1989 
only tiny paraguay run by aging authoritarian alfredo 
stroessner since 1954 remains totally outside the democratic fold 
and despite the occasional rattling of sabers and a few dramatic 
but isolated and abortive barracks revolts in some countries few 
observers feel a military coup is likely anywhere on the continent 
when you have inflation of 1000 percent a year you obviously 
get unhappy people but that doesnt mean theyre inviting a return 
to military rule said paul sigmund a politics professor at 
princton university and an expert on the latin american armed forces 
the military doesnt have a solution to these problems he 
said in a telephone interview with the associated press in the 
1960s they thought they had the answers they dont think they do 
today 
the notion that somehow they could do it better has been 
disproved by their own experience 
in most south american countries economic mismanagement or 
corruption by the politically inexperienced armed forces contributed 
to the return of civilian rule but some of the new civilian 
governments have not proven much more adept at handling the 
continents most urgent and persistent problem grinding poverty 
peru is considered the most volatile example the inflation rate 
is expected to surpass 1000 percent the economy is stagnant and 
little if any headway has been made in improving the plight of a 
hungry peasantry that feeds the ranks of a maoist guerrilla 
organization the shining path 
president alan garcia was considered one of perus new generation 
of charismatic leaders when he took power in 1985 but his 
popularity has plummeted because of what critics see as a 
vacillating economic policy especially since he alienated 
conservative parties and businessman with a plan to nationalize 
foreign banks in 1987 
a recent survey by a limabased polling firm datum found that 
60 percent of peruvians dont believe a military coup is likely 
before garicas term ends in 1990 but 28 percent do a sign that 
democracys foundations are less than rocksolid 
if our problems continue to degenerate and if our institutions 
continue demonstrating ineffectiveness the totalitarian temptation 
will visit us sooner or later said a peruvian political analyst 
luis pasara 
brazil and argentina also are plagued by economic and social 
instability with skyhigh inflation rates and tens of thousands of 
workers striking daily for better pay paralyzing many basic 
services such as transportation and the mail 
brazilian newspapers publish regular reports of government 
corruption nepotism and waste retired gen joao figueiredo the 
last in a series of military presidents who ruled from 1964 to 1985 
told citizens to forget me when he handed over power to a 
civilian now he says he is besieged by supporters asking him to 
return to office 
a popular bumper sticker in bustling rio de janeiro wistfully 
recalls military rule i was happy and i didnt know it 
president raul alfonsin of argentina another charismatic symbol 
of democracys return when he assumed office in 1983 was shouted 
down by hecklers during a recent speech and his radical party trails 
the peronist movement in popularity as the nation prepares for 
elections in may 
but such open expressions of dissent and dissatisfaction reflect 
perhaps the most attractive aspect of life under the new 
democracies freedom of expression and action has been a pledge kept 
by the new governments 
most labor strikes take place unchallenged and the mass media 
suffers few if any restrictions the systematic arrest torture and 
killing of dissidents that took place when troops kept order under 
military rule has been replaced by respect for basic civil and human 
rights

participation in party politics labor federations and other 
social groups both pro and antigovernment is active and 
broadbased across the continent the problem according to some 
analysts is that such groups often work at crosspurposes 
the primary problem in south americas democratic 
reconstruction is the capacity to stabilize the political system 
said the chilean political scientist juan somavia and the 
capacity to stabilize the political system depends on achieving 
basic accords among political parties and the different social 
sectors 
until a country achieves a working stable political system the 
possibility of a coup will remain present said somavia he is 
president of a latin american study group sponsored by the academy 
of christian humanism 
somavia cited uruguay as an example of a new democracy where 
political arrangement is basically working under julio 
sanguinetti who took office in 1985 and is considered one of the 
most widely respected new presidents uruguays political labor and 
business groups have reached a basic understanding that has provided 
stability and economic improvement 
bolivia also is often cited as a democratic success story 
president victor paz estenssoro has overseen an economic austerity 
program that slashed annual inflation from an astounding 20000 
percent to about 10 percent 
the bolivian reforms were painful and politically risky with 
thousands of workers at unprofitable staterun mines laid off and 
new taxes imposed but the governments predictions of stability and 
growth are slowly coming true and as bolivians prepare for new 
presidential elections in may no one considers a coup even remotely 
possible in what traditionally has been south americas most 
political unstable country 
not that the military hasnt made its presence felt paz 
estenssoros predecessor hernan siles suazo was kidnapped by 
police and military officers in 1984 but freed hours later because 
of a vast public and official outcry 
in ecuador gen frank vargas pazzos of the air force led two 
shortlived revolts in 1986 before the government arrested him a 
year later his followers abducted president leon febres cordero and 
held him for 11 hours freeing him only after an amnesty was granted 
to the rebellious vargas pazzos 
two brief but dramatic garrison revolts in argentina in 1987 and 
1988 were defused when president alfonsin agreed to limit human 
rights trials of soldiers 
in each crisis it is widely accepted that the civilian 
governments emerged strengthened 
and although military rumblings persist experts contend there is 
a new less threatening tenor 
the saberrattling is now related to issues that directly 
affect the armed forces as an institution such as human rights 
trials and military spending said sigmund he said they no longer 
are taking public issue with general government policy or 
presenting themselves in the role of national saviors as they did in 
the 1960s 
sigmund said he does not subscribe to the notion of an inevitable 
political cycle of military and civilian rule 
the pendulum has stopped swinging he said 
according to somavia the military also lacks the broadbased 
civilian support for a takeover they enjoyed during the social 
turmoil that affected many south american countries two decades ago 
they have less social force he said no one is asking for 
a coup 
but somavia called the antagonistic relations between the 
military and civilians a central problem that is going to be with 
us for a very long time reestablishing a constructive 
relationship in which the armed forces fully accept civilian control 
is something you cant accomplish in one government

in japanese this country is called nippon or 
sometimes nihon and therein lies a seed of debate 
why is our country called japan its official name is 
nippon kazuo sato wrote in a letter published in september by the 
asahi shimbun provoking a minor flood of other readers letters 
the 26yearold student from tokyo argued that japan should 
unanimously use nippon as its own name on the international 
level on athletes uniforms when they compete abroad for instance 
one of the editors of asahis letters section thought the flurry 
of response and comment was slightly alarming a possible sign of 
nationalistic feelings at a time when emperor hirohito was gravely 
ill 
it is a bit scary that people are interested in such a issue 
especially under the current situation when the emperors illness 
has been affecting the country he said asking that he not be 
named 
but the editor thought it was good for the letters columns to be 
used to debate the issue 
i guess it would be easier if we could choose one name but 
we cannot decide which should be legitimate he said 
not everybody is sensitive about the countrys name or worried 
that japan is getting nationalistic 
a foreign relations specialist and conservative writer hideaki 
kase said i think its fine to have a few different names there 
seems to be no problem using either japan or nippon it has 
nothing to do with nationalism 
a foreign ministry official said there are no rules on how to 
name countries in other languages and he noted that japan is 
spelled japon in spanish and pronounced like hapon 
but what should japanese athletes wear on their uniforms for 
international competition no one but the chinese would be able to 
recognize japans name written in the chinese characters which 
japan borrowed to make a writing system centuries ago so it has to 
be written in the roman alphabet called romaji in japanese 
kayoko yamamoto a spokesman for the japan amateur sports 
association said the organization provides uniforms emblazoned 
japan for international athletic events 
for major international events we use japan as the countrys 
official name because english is the most common language she 
said 
but theres no firm rule and some teams also go with nippon 
masaaki obana of the japan volleyball association said the 
national volleyball team has both japan and nippon uniforms but 
players wear nippon more often in international contests 
either way theyre our countrys names we dont think we 
should be using only one of the two obana said 
after satos letter was published the volleyball association 
received many inquiries asking which name is official because 
japanese volleyball players wore their nippon uniforms at the summer 
olympics games in seoul south korea 
the asahi editor said the newspaper japans secondlargest 
circulation daily received about 10 letters on the issues 
karen blahitka from yamaguchi prefecture in southwestern japan 
wrote that she was against using nippon because many languages as 
well as japanese translate foreign countries names into their own 
tongue and englishspeaking countries are no exception 
for example bundesrepublik deutschland is the federal republic 
of germany or colloquially west germany in english and nishi 
doitsu in japanese she said 
teacher tatsuya akizuki 36 wrote it is a huge task to change 
the way a countrys name or persons name which has already become 
fixed in our daily lives is pronounced 
if japanese are told to accurately pronounce country names and 
names of people in the languages of the respective countries we 
would be in trouble he added 
the origin of the name japan is not certain but researchers say 
it probably came from the malayan japung or the chinese 
riben meaning roughly land of the rising sun 
historians say the japanese called their country yamato in its 
early history and they began using nippon around the seventh 
century nippon and nihon are used interchangeably as the countrys 
name

with little hope of winning the 
presidency venezuelas minor political parties are seeking to make 
inroads in congress in national elections dec 4 
they are counting on a major defection from the nations two main 
parties 
the small parties acknowledge that their 23 presidential 
candidates including a handful of leftists a witchdoctor some 
retired military officers and a former central bank president 
dont have a chance in the presidential balloting 
but they say widespread voter discontent with the governments 
accion democratica ad and the main opposition party copei will 
be shown in splitticket voting that could yield a congress of 182 
deputies and 44 senators with no single party in control 
it would mean a major change in recent venezuelan voting patterns 
with longerterm effects as the nation slowly decentralizes its 
political system they said 
people are not happy with ad or copei but they recognize their 
candidates have the best chance to win the presidency but their 
true electoral preference will be shown in the congressional vote 
said freddy munoz secretary general of movement to socialism mas 
venezuelas third largest electoral force 
most political analysts agree small parties the larger of which 
are left of center are likely to post gains in congress 
they note that voters associate the countrys economic slump 
about to enter its eighth year with centerright copei and 
centerleft ad 
the crisis caused by low oil prices began under a copei 
administration and has continued under current ad administration of 
president jaime lusinchi 
polls indicate that while over 75 percent of the electorate 
express a preference for either ads frontrunning candidate carlos 
andres perez or copeis eduardo fernandez only half the eligible 
voters have decided to vote for one of the two parties 
congressional slates 
the disaffection has been exacerbated by unexciting campaigns ad 
politicians bemoan the triumphalism of the partys candidates 
who have depended on perezs popularity to sweep them into office 
rather than campaigning for themselves 
mas on the other hand adopted a campaign strategy that 
deemphasized the campaign of its presidential candidate former 
guerrilla teodoro petkoff in favor of its congressional candidates 
the ticketsplitting would be a major change from recent 
venezuelan voting patterns 
in the six elections since 1958 ad and copei alternated in the 
presidency since 1973 the two parties combined have garnered not 
less than 88 percent of the presidential vote 
minor parties had just 27 seats in the last 200member house of 
deputies including 10 from mas ad had 113 seats and copei 60 and 
some of the small parties ally themselves with ad or copei 
but even if mas gets around 15 percent of the congressional vote 
as some analysts predict it likely would have little impact on the 
direction of venezuelan politics in the short term 
with venezuelas overwhelmingly strong executive branch 
congressional action is normally limited to making minor adjustments 
to presidential initiatives 
but ticketsplitting could mean a revival of mas and the ability 
of small national or regional parties to survive until the 
presidential election in 1993 
their survival takes on more significance as the big parties 
reluctantly allow some decentralization of power to take place

editors note for most of the 70 years since the soviet union 
came into being soviet history was tailored and falsified to suit 
the rulers in the kremlin and the party dogmatists in todays freer 
atmosphere long suppressed truths are allowed to emerge and the 
nation is trying hard to come to grips with them

in a cool pine glade north of the byelorussian 
capital of minsk where soviet families used to come to picnic 
stroll or play chess two schoolboys made a grisly discovery 
digging around in the kuropaty forest during their may day 
holiday last spring the boys unearthed some human skeletons that 
started a grim search for historical truth 
since then archaeologists have made wholescale excavations and 
researchers now estimate that more than 100000 people were shot and 
buried in mass graves there during the political purges of the late 
1930s 
in the soviet union the past never lies far beneath the surface 
history is an abiding obsession here 
for the soviet nation whose 70year existence fits into a single 
human lifespan the past surges up again and again to influence the 
present in the more open atmosphere permitted by president mikhail 
s gorbachevs policy of glasnost soviets are trying to come to 
grips with their nations often dark troubling and contradictory 
legacy and use it to map a course for the future 
people write heatedly and passionately about the events of 50 
years ago as if they were writing about todays problems 
gorbachev said this year there is nothing surprising about this 
they are talking about the most important thing for us about how 
it could happen that along with the heroic achievements of the 
people crimes against them became possible 
world war ii is refought several times a week on staterun 
television in movies and documentaries rainy fall days barely thin 
the throngs outside the red brick gates of moscows novodevichy 
cemetery where soviets come to see the tombs of departed kremlin 
leaders who once fixed the course of their lives 
history is never far behind the headlines 
armenians waging a long noisy campaign to annex the 
nagornokarabakh region of neighboring azerbaijan are contesting a 
soviet government decision made in 1923 that awarded the 
predominantly armenian region to azerbaijan 
in the three baltic republics mass movements arise to demand 
greater autonomy from moscow some estonians latvians and 
lithuanians even seek total independence demonstrations are 
triggered by each anniversary of the 1939 hitlerstalin pact that 
awarded control of the states then sovereign nations to the soviet 
union which absorbed them 
gorbachev embarked on a bold course to revitalize the nations 
economy trim its bureaucracy and get the citizenry more involved in 
decisionmaking rarely speaks publicly without citing the 
stagnation of leonid i brezhnevs rule and the harsh administrative 
grip imposed by dictator josef v stalin 
in the atmosphere of freer inquiry and debate fostered by 
glasnost the study of the past has become both an eagerly shared 
passion and a bitter divisive issue for soviets with the top man 
in the kremlin out in front with the calls for increased candor 
one cannot agree with those who propose that we forget our 
history or use only a certain part of it gorbachev said in 
january all this enables us to draw lessons for the present 
and to disclose more fully the potential of socialism and its 
values 
but more than 3 years into gorbachevs rule it still isnt clear 
whether glasnost will bring unhampered historical scholarship and 
the right to differ on fundamental questions or just substitute one 
kremlin orthodoxy for another 
gorbachev himself recently chaired the meeting of a special 
communist party commission preparing a new concise history of 
the party showing how keenly he wants his influence to be felt in 
the new soviet view of the past 
school history texts full of ritual selfcongratulations 
radiant socialist futures and cartoonlike heroes and villains were 
thrown out and are being rewritten 
windows on the past shut tight for years by the censor have 
been opened soviets now jostle at lending libraries for works about 
the longconcealed blank spots in their history the book most 
in demand is anatoly rybakovs children of the arbat a novel 
about the bloody swath cut through society by stalins political 
terror that left its traces of horror at kuropaty 
and history in the gorbachev era has meant the humbling of the 
memories of men who while alive were spoken of as the worthy 
spiritual heirs of soviet founder vladimir i lenin

a leningrad monument to brezhnev was spirited away at night a 
vandal at moscow state university spilled ink on a memorial plaque 
to former kremlin ideologue mikhail a suslov the city of izhevsk 
which once bore the name of dmitri f ustinov spent more than 32 
million to wipe the late defense ministers name off street signs 
official stationery and railway timetables 
for gorbachev and his allies history matters because it bares 
the mistakes of past kremlin leaders and points away from what 
gorbachev wants to avoid the totalitarianism and bureaucratic 
chokehold on society that marred stalins rule the erratic 
capriciousness of nikita s khrushchev the complacency and moral 
rot under brezhnev 
it is said that people learn from mistakes and nations learn 
from tragedies let us learn one author l ovrutsky said in a 
newspaper article on soviet history this year 
gorbachev also seeks to right what he regards as historical 
injustices by rehabilitating some of the revolutionaries and 
visionaries stalin destroyed gorbachev has been able to resurrect 
their oncediscredited ideas as ideological underpinning for his own 
reforms 
training glasnosts spotlight back into the past has had 
sensational results among the revelations this year 
brezhnev reportedly was clinically dead at one point in 1976 
but recovered at least partially and remained soviet president until 
his death in 1982 
stalin was described by one soviet newspaper as a paranoid 
whose brain was damaged by a stroke 
nikolai i bukharin and other stalin foes shot as enemies of 
the people in the 1930s are now said to have been framed 
such reports have startled a country long fed a diet of 
reassuring kremlin communiques 
in the past two years i have learned more than i did in the 
previous 50 years of my life one middleaged muscovite recently 
told a newspaper 
predictably the questioning doubts and criticism where before 
there was often only praise have produced a backlash among soviets 
who feel that their entire history even the building of socialism 
itself has been besmirched 
i would very much like to understand who needs and why to 
have every prominent leader of the party central committee and the 
soviet government compromised after he leaves office and discredited 
in connection with his actual or supposed mistakes and calculations 
where did we get this passion for squandering the prestige and 
dignity of the leaders of the worlds first socialist country a 
leningrad teacher wrote in the sovietskaya rossiya daily earlier in 
the year 
the official response to that letter signed by nina andreyeva 
demonstrated how explosive the issue of history in the soviet union 
can be and the limits still drawn on historical scholarship 
pravda the partys principal organ attacked its fellow newspaper 
for printing a document lauding stalin and forced sovietskaya 
rossiya to recant by printing the pravda attack 
despite glasnost stalin or brezhnev are rarely defended in 
print since gorbachevs policy is avowedly the opposite of theirs 
praise for his predecessors could be or might seem to be an attack 
on gorbachev or his policy of change 
but on the whole glasnost has meant a dramatic widening of the 
historical field and a coming to terms with some of the 
uncomfortable truths of the soviet past that long lay hidden or were 
played down historian fyodor burlatsky was referring to the 195364 
khrushchev era but might well have been speaking of all soviet 
history when he said 
for a long time a very long time talking about those stormy 
years was not accepted practice it was as if someones hand had 
ripped out an entire chapter from our chronicle

asir sandler remembers the 
interrogation the death sentence never carried out and the tiny 
knots he tied in pieces of string to remind him of what he saw in a 
stalinist labor camp north of this capital of the gulag 
trudy richter a german communist whose nationality couldnt save 
her remembers the filthy crowded ferry ride from vladivostok to 
magadan and her husband who never returned 
this city of the soviet far east like so much of the soviet 
union is torn between the urge to remember and the desire to forget 
josef stalins purges that put it on the map and gave it the fearful 
reputation it still is trying to outlive 
thousands of stalins political prisoners were sent through 
magadan nothing more than a couple of stone buildings and wooden 
barracks in the 1930s on their way north to the gold mines and 
labor camps of the kolyma region of the far northeast 
sandler 71 a native of baku in the warm southern republic of 
azerbaijan spent the last several of his 10 years of labor camp as 
prisoner m1866 in a camp in the kolyma region 
he met with foreign reporters in magadan recently to show them 
how he made the coded knots in pieces of string to record what he 
saw those strings hidden in the camp and smuggled out by a means 
he still wont reveal gave him some of the materials he has used to 
write about camp life 
your life there was hanging by a hair every minute he said 
you could be strangled by criminals for your portion of water and 
your piece of bread 
halfstarved prisoners nevertheless were required to be neat and 
even a loose corner on his number badge could mean 10 days in a 
punishment cell on only 200 grams of bread and a cup of boiled water 
a day 
sandler arrived in the magadan region in 1947 already a prisoner 
for many years after being accused of spying for germany during 
world war ii during a long interrogation the charge eventually was 
reduced to carrying a poem in his pocket that insulted stalin 
a military tribunal in baku sentenced him to be shot but allowed 
him to ask for clemency and then let him sit for another 90 days 
while the stress built up and his weight dropped from 70 kilograms 
154 pounds to 42 kilograms 92 pounds 
in the end he realized it was better to be a spy than to 
threaten stalin sandler said i understood that if i didnt 
sign what the investigator wanted i wouldnt live another two 
months 
stories such as sandlers have given magadan a reputation 
difficult to outlive 
magadan is regarded as a city of sad fate this we remember and 
we know mayor gennady dorofeyev told the journalists we cant 
reject this we cant hide it 
but when asked about building a monument to stalins victims as 
moscow and other cities are planning officials point out the city 
already has a monument to eduard berzin berzin an official of the 
secret police organization that was responsible for opening up the 
far east with political prisoners himself fell victim to stalin

donna newman and bill blocher expected the 
house they bought for 13800 from the department of housing and 
urban development to provide a steady rental income when they 
retired 
what they didnt expect was the letter from the sheriffs office 
ominously headed notice of potential for unknown health hazard 
blocher had let his son move into the aging twolevel 
woodframe house police say the son and four other people turned it 
into a clandestine lab for making methamphetamine a crystallized 
powder that acts much like cocaine 
the june 15 letter came five days after police raided the house 
suddenly newman and her husband were absentee caretakers of a 
building that might be contaminated with potentially toxic chemicals 
used to make meth 
speed cookers once found maiexist that it is 
real 
however security on the bomber program will remain tight and no 
data has been revealed on specifics of the aircrafts capabilities 
were not going to give all that away mullaney said it 
remains a classified program 
stealth fighters reportedly have been flying for several years 
but only at night a photo of that plane was released because it is 
ready for daylight flights officials said 
the stealth bomber socalled because it is intended to be 
extremely difficult to detect on enemy radar has been described as 
a sleek dark flying wing with no sharp angles to reflect radar and 
built of exotic composite materials some of which will absorb radar 
rather than reflect it 
flight tests will be conducted at edwards air force base about 
70 miles north of los angeles in the mojave desert the air force 
said when the drawing was released that the maiden flight would be 
the short hop from the plant at palmdale to edwards 
the b2 is described as an allaltitude penetration bomber as 
opposed to the b1 bomber which is designed to penetrate enemy air 
defenses at low altitudes 
this is a bizarrelooking machine said bill sweetman an 
aviation writer and editor who wrote stealth aircraft the secrets 
of future airpower this is going to be a really unusual 
sinisterlooking aircraft 
the air force says the plane is 69 feet long about the length of 
an f16 fighter plane and has no tail its wingspan at 172 feet 
is almost as wide as the aging b52 
it is revolutionary mullaney said it is a unique 
aircraft 
in addition to being difficult to detect on radar it has become 
increasingly difficult to estimate the final price of the stealth 
bomber recent estimates for the 132 aircraft requested by the air 
force have climbed as high as 685 billion according to the 
general accounting office 
the b1b came in somewhere around 250 million apiece before 
modifications stealth bombers could cost twice as much 
cost questions aside sweetman said the stealth bomber sitting in 
the palmdale hangar represents a massive achievement in aerospace 
technology

editors note twenty years ago an anonymous donor left an 
injured hawk on leonard soucys doorstep whoever did it picked the 
right house soucy has since patched up thousands of birds not to 
mention the occasional lame duck 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it is hard to pinpoint just when a man 
decides to turn his back yard into a repair shop for wrecked birds 
for leonard soucy it probably came 20 years ago when an anonymous 
someone like an unwed mother abandoning her newborn in a basket at 
the church door left a redtailed hawk with a broken wing in a 
cardboard box on his front stoop 
it was a challenge soucy couldnt say no to he still cant 
that is why his current back yard is an intensive care facility 
of assorted cages some the size of boxcars in which he endeavors 
to restore to the wild squadrons of sick and injured owls hawks 
eagles falcons and selected songbirds and the occasional lame duck 
in earthly terms appropriate to a pirates parrot soucy tells 
how birds have taken over his home his bank account his job and 
even his wife diane 
birds have eaten me up theyve consumed my life 
these are the birds who came to dinner as it were for whose 
convalescence soucy flies in 10000 crickets a week from a tennessee 
breeder millions of grub worms from california grasshoppers galore 
from georgia and 150000 rodents a year 
i have 10000 meal worms here right now and theyre just 
snacks exclaims soucy to whom sotto voce is an abomination 
this cost 100000 last year if the food wasnt donated it 
would have cost 250000 just one rat costs 250 a mouse is 
109 but i have to do it no one else is going to 
soucy may have as many as 500 recovering birds at a time in his 
100000 cubic feet of cages theres a barred owl on the mend from 
entanglement with a kite string a golden eagle with a broken wing 
hawks shot by what soucy calls unprintable slobs orphaned birds 
raised from infancy an oriole that will winter over because it did 
not recover until after the last flight south 
soucy still tries to sandwich his profession as a selfemployed 
tool and die pattern maker around a hobby that was once a sopwith 
camel and is now a b52 this sometimes requires him to go to his 
paying job at 2 am there are emergency calls at all hours 
a bird gets hit falls out of the nest it doesnt belong to 
the police not the dog warden doesnt belong to anybody so they 
say call soucy a screech owl flies down a chimney and catches 
fire call soucy a goshawk crashes through a picture window and 
lands dazed on a coffee table call soucy 
theres nobody else to pass them to the bird stops here 
last year soucys busiest yet 1485 wild birds ended up on his 
doorstep this included 240 raptors the carnivorous birds he 
specializes in about half recovered and were returned to the wild 
repair is not cheap 
to do an intramedulary fusion of a birds wing bone with a pin 
can cost 400 for the operation postop care can approach 1000 
fortunately soucy has two understanding veterinarians nearby 
drs andrew major in plainfield and ken jacobsen in basking ridge 
who donate their surgical skills 
we can keep a bird alive 90 percent of the time but can we 
restore it 100 percent the bird wont make it in the wild if its 
only 75 percent so we keep about 100 for educational lectures at 
schools and such and euthenize the rest 
soucys preoccupation with raptors is evolutionary he was born 
in cedar grove nj 57 years ago when it had some open land not 
the 40000 people its packed with today he learned nature from an 
uncle a hunter a species soucy has no quarrel with despite the 
many gunshotmaimed birds hes treated 
no competent moral hunter will shoot hawks and owls the 
bleeping slobs do 
his interest was piqued years ago when he read an article in 
audubon magazine on hawks so he and diane went out to hawk mountain 
in eastern pennsylvania to see the fall migration when thousands of 
raptors may fly by in a day riding the thermals south 
i couldnt imagine 1000 hawks in the whole world much less 
overhead 
gunners used to shoot hundreds of birds in a day at hawk mountain 
just to try their aim this ended in 1934 when a wealthy woman from 
new york mrs rosalie edge acquired the mountain as a refuge for 
the birds and birdwatchers cape may an even bigger migrating 
junction at the tip of new jersey was another gunnery range this 
stopped when the federal government outlawed shooting raptors in 
1972 
by then soucy and diane had been in the bird repair business for 
four years they had rehabilitated that first red tail and released 
it one thing led to another so they bought a home in semirural 
land next to the great swamp wildlife refuge here it started out as 
a backyard hobby a gesture to right some of the wrongs committed by 
the biggest raptor of them all man

the stupidity of man not doing better gradually enraged me all 
things on earth are valuable to us because they help stabilize the 
darn thing i was raised to think man owned the world weve got to 
get out of this idea because were a part of it its all our world 
weve got to take care of momma earth 
he had no illusions about it being easy 
historically this country has a lovehate relationship with 
raptors we put the bald eagle on our national seal but there used 
to be a bounty on them people dont care if a robin kills a worm 
but its whats being killed that matters a fox that kills a 
chicken is a bad fox if it kills a snake its a good fox to 
hunters a hawk that killed a rabbit was a bad thing so they killed 
the hawk and then the rabbit farmers thought raptors were vermin 
but very very very few hawks will kill chickens but thats a hard 
sell 
soucy accepts raptors for what they are meateaters in natures 
scheme just like the folks at burger king 
raptors are truly remarkable animals an owl can see a lighted 
match a halfmile away a hawk two miles up can see a rabbit and 
know its a rabbit they probably have the best eyesight in the 
whole world he admires their efforts to try and adapt to a world 
not of natures making for study hes trapped a snowy owl 
underneath the wing of a concorde jet parked at kennedy airport 
as soucys reputation spread so did the cages out back but hes 
a realist he will not turn away a tearful youngster who shows up 
with a baby phoebe that has fallen out of the nest but his eye 
cannot be on every sparrow 
obviously there are limits 
he and diane learned as they went along designing cages and 
treating the patients so as not to make permanent welfare cases of 
their ailing flock there are triumphs 
in 1982 which happened to be the national year of the bald 
eagle one of them fell out of the sky it ended up here i took it 
to bill hobby a local vet and he got an iv into the bird he found 
it had too much mercury in its blood six weeks later we flew him 
down to chesapeake bay in a donated lear jet with an nbctv crew and 
returned a healthy eagle to the sky 
in time the big birds began running into big money it costs 
175 to air freight a recovered osprey down to florida after 
migrating season ive shipped ferruginous hawks to arizona when it 
looked like diane was going down in a heap and i couldnt afford it 
any more a friend said we should incorporate 
they are now the raptor trust eligible for taxexempt donations 
a local lumber company donates wood for cages atampt which has huge 
office complexes in the area gave 7000 for a new cage in the 
summer the soucys have five fulltime staffers and 25 volunteers 
the hobby has become one of the 10 biggest bird recovery operations 
in the nation 
we took a fiveday vacation this year the first in 16 years i 
hired jean stamy an exteacher to show school groups around i 
told her shed work harder and be paid less if she came to me i 
kept my promise 
the reality is how big can we get we dont charge for our 
services whom do you send a bill to so we have to beg thats 
what ive become a beggar 
soucy has raised 185000 to buy the property next door for more 
space and an educational center to make a hard sell a little easier 
i like to think were setting an example in the last 20 years 
americans have gone back to being more intolerant of nature gone 
back to their computers and porsches if they had more sympathy for 
the planet that sustains us maybe they wouldnt puke on their world 
so much 
i figure ive put 100000 hours into all this and ive never 
taken a dime out said soucy strolling among the cages under the 
penetrating stare of his patients 
maria the golden eagle a permanent resident eyed him 
dispassionately three snowy owls watched unblinkingly a clutch of 
great horned owls as stately as supreme court justices in a group 
portrait perched motionless on a dead limb their thoughts about 
leonard soucy if any were inscrutable his werent 
ive thought weekly id finally give it up maybe something 
died youd worked hard over twenty years ive been out in the back 
yard putting broken birds back together where did all that time 
go 
he stared back at the owls 
i dont think i would do it all over again 
he reconsidered i dont know 
he brightened 
but ive probably got more god bless yous in my life than 
most people

one night david bromberg whod played guitar live with arlo 
guthrie on his hit alices restaurant on new york 
underground radio station wbai and walker were hobnobbing 
around in the village bromberg persuaded walker to go to wbai and 
perform mr bojangles the station recorded it and kept playing 
it people listening to circus maximus in greenwich village would 
ask who wrote mr bojangles walker was hot he says i cut 
three albums in about a fivemonth period 
i didnt like the city atmosphere of cutting records i decided 
i wanted to get out i live my life in the 70s i was in texas 
doing what i wanted to do i wound up having the strongest part of 
my career 
i dont have a career i have an adventure with a guitar 
with his lost gonzo band walker cut four records between 1974 
and 78 viva terlingua became his biggestselling album 
these days walker travels with another texas 
performersongwriter and their guitars he says i go out and work 
about 10 days a month on average any more money than that and 
youve got to pay the irs all of it 
the charlie daniels band goes on those huge endurance tours he 
has three semitrailers and two buses 
you can play it on the guitar and people will be touched i 
played two nights in a beautiful wooden concert hall in hanover 
nh with 1100 people there three nights later i was in keene 
nh a theater that held about 750 people i had two guitars and my 
songs and stories people had a great time you need to have a 
wellrounded repertoire the symplicity of doing it is enjoyable it 
leaves room for profit for the promoter and the artist 
steve fromholz opens for me he wrote id have to be crazy 
for willie nelson ive cut a duet with willie one of steves 
songs the man with the big hats buying steve and i have been 
doing it for the last few concerts as an encore and it has been 
knocking them out 
it was time to do something simple again 
i was running myself pretty ragged through the 1970s with the 
gonzo band we did 150 or 200 shows a year an album every six 
months and were partying pretty hard while we were touring wed 
party at night travel do a show we had two chartered planes with 
us if we were within an hours flight of new orleans wed fly there 
and party in the french quarter till 5 in the morning we were 
tearing it up we were on that kind of roll we thought it was fun 
in 1979 i found out i had five years with no tax records my 
people had paid some but the records were shoddy i owed quite a bit 
and penalties i had a lot of that to catch up 
when i hit 1980 i decided it was time to make some lifestyle 
changes and patch some holes up i had a 2yearold daughter i 
started scaling down a bit some tours with the band and some solo 
i got my wife more involved with the accounting and myself more 
entangled with the business end of it she has been my manager since 
1985 
i had to remortgage the house this is the first year since 
1968 i dont owe anything im actually able to make some gains 
jessie jane is 10 now and django cody is 6 i wrote djangos 
lullaby for him i make up a lot of songs i dont write down that

nancy papineau still shudders at the 
memory of the slimy tangle of suctioncupfilled mouths and 
toothladen tongues in the fish tank at dave richards bait shop 
absolutely gross horrible she says 
richard agrees sea lampreys arent a pretty sight nonetheless 
hes displayed them off and on for four years with lampreys 
threatening the local sportfishing industry richard wants folks to 
know what they look like 
its real serious says richard who also fishes 
commercially id say if they dont control them the lake will be 
dead within the next 10 years theyre getting on everything 
no one knows for certain how the lampreys which are indigenous 
to the ocean and have no natural predator entered lake champlain 
one theory suggests that they hitched rides on boats regardless of 
how they arrived theyve been there for over a century and 
lately people who rely on the lake for their livelihoods dont like 
what theyre seeing 
goose gagnon is one of them he quit his job in a furniture 
factory last year to devote all his time to commercial fishing 
there will be days when you come out and every fish you land has a 
lamprey hit on them more than one says gagnon whos been 
fishing the lake for over 30 years some ive cut open and i 
refuse to eat because the meat looked bad 
gagnons not alone 
ive seen fish jump that had five or six lampreys on em and 
usually theyre about 8 inches long says ken coleman who moved 
to willsboro from michigan three years ago and they will stay 
with that fish as long as possible in most cases that one hit 
doesnt kill the fish this is why youll see fish with scars and 
if they lose that fish theyll take another one so they may go 
through three or four fish until they reach their full size 
its pretty severe acknowledges paul neff an aquatic 
biologist with the new york state bureau of fisheries sea lamprey 
activity is intense theres a big population in the many tens of 
thousands we should be seeing fish 8 to 15 pounds and we just 
arent seeing them lake champlain historically had a tremendous 
population of atlantic salmon and that population went right down 
the tubes it also had a good lake trout population and that went 
right down the tubes 
lampreys are blamed for much of that loss they spawn in wetlands 
and streams that feed the lake and their larvae can live there for 
three or more years tom jolliff sea lamprey unit leader for the 
new york bureau of fisheries says one female might spawn up to 
100000 eggs at a time and each lamprey can live up to 17 years 
killing 40 pounds of fish during its life 
lampreys which can grow longer than 20 inches normally do their 
damage in the deepest extremities of their habitat using their 
mouths and tongues the lampreys latch onto fish bore holes in 
their sides and literally suck the life out of the fish until they 
are near death 
these days the lampreys in lake champlain the sixthlargest 
freshwater lake in the nation are acting more like predators than 
the parasites they actually are their favorite targets are no 
longer just salmon and lake trout 
theyre hitting pike and bass scaly warmwater fish that 
they never hit before says mike brown an outdoors writer who 
lives on the lake i caught a lot of pike last year that were 32 
inches long and only weighed three pounds they were like stick 
fish 
the lamprey bothers the lake trout and the salmon but its 
nothing compared to the job its doing on the brown trout and the 
steelheads says coleman who dealt with a similar problem in the 
great lakes when he worked for the michigan game department you 
dont see a brown trout in here more than 2 years old 
fishermen arent the only ones feeling the effects

swimmers are even being hit says new york assemblyman chris 
ortloff whose district borders the lake what that tells us is 
that there are so many lamprey that theyre indiscriminately 
attaching themselves to whatever swims by because there simply 
arent enough trout and salmon in the lake to support them all 
the situation has been getting worse since the mid1970s ever 
since new york and vermont began stocking hundreds of thousands of 
salmon and trout every year to make the 125milelong lake a 
sportfishing mecca 
john anderson a vermont fisheries manager says one reason for 
the stocking was to study the lamprey problem 
some people think weve dragged our feet anderson says 
but if we went ahead and treated the lake without evaluating the 
situation wed have been hauled into the courts and wed be there 
forever 
still the study has taken nearly a decade and makes no sense to 
coleman why on earth they ever did what they did is beyond me 
he says they recreated the fishery backward they should have 
treated the lampreys first and then stocked the fish they gave them 
food so bang the population soared 
last august new york vermont and the canadian province of 
quebec signed an agreement to work together to improve the lake in 
addition vermont and new york are cooperating on a plan to control 
the lampreys the new york state department of environmental 
conservation the us fish and wildlife service and the vermont 
department of fish and wildlife have assembled a 433page draft 
environmental impact statement in connection with a proposed lamprey 
control program if it works officials estimate 500 jobs would be 
created and increased sport fishing would generate 25 million to 
35 million a year 
the plan calls for two socalled lampricides to be applied 
twice in fouryear intervals in 14 streams nine in new york and 
five in vermont and five streamdelta areas the experiment which 
would begin next fall would cost about 3 million 
tfm is the main chemical that would be used the amount applied 
kills lampreys but can be metabolized by most other fish and has not 
harmed water fowl mammals or humans its been used extensively and 
successfully in the great lakes and in two of new yorks finger 
lakes cayuga lake and seneca lake and has proven relatively 
harmless the main detriment is that some nontarget organisms 
invertebrates such as worms and insects on which fish feed will be 
killed but not to any great extent according to the environmental 
statement 
bayer 73 the other chemical is used in other countries to treat 
tapeworm in humans and in this country to treat domestic animals 
as usual the notion of applying chemicals to the environment is 
creating apprehension 
my organization is very concerned about the program and its 
impact says joan mulhern associate director of the vermont 
public interest research group a privately funded citizen action 
group weve been studying the environmental impact statement and 
identifying what we think are inadequacies with that report weve 
found a lot of discrepancies between the environmental impact 
statement and information from the environmental protection agency 
about the chemicals that are going to be used theres a lot more 
information that needs to be given to the public 
like vpirg the lake champlain committee a natural resource 
advocacy group based in burlington vt hasnt taken a stand on the 
matter yet but its members are also concerned 
we want to know alternatives says spokeswoman lori fisher 
we dont want the public money to get only channeled into a 
proposal that would stimulate recreational trophy fishing 
we cant lose sight of the fact that we have fish for human 
consumption significantly impacted by pcbs and chlordane theres a 
rule to eat only one fish a month out of the lake we need a 
considerable amount of money to find a solution to that we cant 
lose sight of those types of problems we want people to look at the 
larger picture 
new yorkers got the chance to voice their views on the matter 
recently at hearings in ticonderoga and plattsburgh and sentiment 
favored treating the lake vermonters will get their turn at public 
hearings next february officials from both states will assess the 
publics reaction and decide whether to go ahead with the plan for 
it to work both states must cooperate

dabney coleman has made a career of playing 
highpowered cads nevertheless hes unhappy with the way 
businessmen are portrayed on tv 
in his latest movie nbcs maybe baby set for monday hes a 
nice guy for a change he plays a successful middleaged 
businessman still he fears his comfortable way of life will be 
interrupted because his new wife jane curtin feels her biological 
clock ticking and wants to have a baby 
id like to find something on broadway or a picture that 
involves a family business situation he says i want to play a 
successful moral businessman youre either a cad whos successful 
or youre a nice guy who isnt successful jimmy stewart was a nice 
guy in you cant take it with you but he was a failure as a 
businessman the two just dont seem to go hand in hand 
coleman is bestknown for his outrageous roles in such movies as 
9 to 5 and tootsie and on television in fernwood 
2night fresno buffalo bill and the slap maxwell 
story but hes also played it straight as in on golden pond 
and the home box office movie murrow in which he played cbs 
founder william paley 
coleman says his view of businessmen is influenced by his former 
fatherinlaw stanton hale onetime chairman of pacific mutual 
life insurance co coleman had been married to jane hale 
that kind of integrity you dont often see on the screen 
says coleman 
coleman hasnt yet found his role he recently completed 
production in appleton wis of meet the applegates a comedy 
for new world pictures he plays the leader of a group of highly 
developed giant insects from brazil who assume human form to save 
the world from what they see as the danger of nuclear energy his 
character is called aunt bea 
he is at his brentwood home between the two roles when he talks 
about maybe baby an avid baseball fan coleman wears a cap that 
says sa to shield his face from the sun on the patio it stands 
for the san antonio missions one of his favorite teams 
he grew up in texas and on visits to his home state he 
occasionally stopped in san antonio when ramon martinez now with 
the los angeles dodgers was pitching for the missions 
coleman says brandon tartikoff president of nbc entertainment 
once told him ill bet you bat to right center 
id played some ball in texas he says and i asked him how 
he knew brandon said i know that because thats the way you play 
a character brandon could spot it he once aspired to be a 
professional baseball player 
in maybe baby a romantic comedy coleman sees his good life 
jeopardized when his wife decides to put her career on hold long 
enough to have a child his character has already raised a family 
and isnt interested in starting over again at his age the movie 
also stars julia duffy as his daughter florence stanley as his 
secretary and david doyle as his poker buddy 
hes successful but i dont know what business it is says 
coleman hes successful enough to knock off at noon for golf it 
must be nice to work about five hours a day the storys about 
whether its too late for them to have a child he says can you 
picture a 70yearold man rooting for his kid at a little league 
game but to jane its a case of now or never 
coleman says he enjoyed working once again with jane curtin they 
were in the 1980 movie how to beat the high cot of living he 
played her policeman boyfriend that movie also starred susan saint 
james who teamed up with curtin for the comedy series kate amp 
allie 
immediately prior to maybe baby coleman played a lawyer in 
the abc miniseries baby m 
he had also starred in the abc comedy series the slap maxwell 
story which was canceled due to low ratings and a disagreement 
between coleman and producercreator jay tarses over how the show 
should go slap maxwell a somewhat disagreeable sports writer was 
a nicer version of buffalo bill an earlier series for nbc 
i think where we went awry with slap maxwell was that i 
thought hed be different says coleman i thought hed be 
honest creative a legitimate grownup professional as opposed to 
buffalo bill but in the quest for comedy we had a tendency to be 
like buffalo bill bill was a child a selfserving disloyal cad 
it was fun to play that it was funnier theres no question 
i would have enjoyed slap more if it had been funnier but 
im proud of it it was not a lot of fun but thats not always the 
case with things youre proud of

hello my name is geoff and i have aids 
hi im tony and i have aids 
the introductions mark the beginning of an uplifting and 
unnerving theater experience called aids alive a revue 
performed by men branded these days by three letters each is a pwa 
person with aids or aidsrelated complex 
they are all members of the pwa theater workshop and aids 
alive is their story theyve told it in high schools 
universities theaters social centers nightclubs hospitals just 
about anywhere people will listen 
there have been plays about aids before primarily as is and 
the normal heart both of which had successful runs in new york 
and in regional theaters but in aids alive the performers 
arent just acting they celebrate their own lives while facing 
death 
the workshop was born in 1987 the inspiration of an actor named 
nick pippin and a producer named sylvia stein 
i was diagnosed a long time ago ages ago recalls the boyish 
34yearold pippin who has had aids since 1985 back then we just 
left our jobs and sat around waiting to die but i knew that if i 
didnt start doing something i was going to die 
he helped create the workshop and set in motion plans for aids 
alive a series of loosely constructed vignettes that tell how 
people with aids do more than just survive 
the show grew out of taped interviews conducted with pwas the 
conversations were fashioned into nearly an hours worth of theater 
by playwright lanie robertson bestknown as the author of the 
billie holiday musical lady day at emersons bar and grill 
there are short sketches and monologues actors dont necessarily 
tell their own stories although all the incidents in aids alive 
are true 
some of the material is devastating the stories are of the 
separation of father and son driven apart by the disease or of 
sick workers fired by their employers 
but much of it is humorous in a black catch22 sort of way a 
mother tells her son she will be serving thanksgiving dinner on 
paper plates one man is harassed by a creditor who when told the 
customer has aids snarls so youre going to take the easy way 
out 
humor was a very important thing for all of us says geoff 
edholm a workshop member we all have had very bizarre 
experiences in the hospital with procedures and treatments 
the actors now numbering about a dozen are all volunteers 
usually there are five men in each performance 
most of us found out about the group by wordofmouth says 
edholm one of the few workshop members who also is a professional 
actor tom lutz joined the group after his mother met pippins 
mother at a support group meeting 
i had no theater experience at all and volunteered with the 
idea of doing stage managing or being wardrobe mistress lutz 
laughs 
audience reaction changes during the course of an evening 
beginning with silence then smiles laughter even a few tears and 
then cheers 
in the very beginning they dont know they can laugh edholm 
says aids is not supposed to be funny but in a few minutes they 
get the idea that were having fun and were laughing 
for most of the company appearing in aids alive is their 
only steady job and they dont get paid just a 50amonth 
stipend from the workshop many had to leave their fulltime jobs 
because they were too ill to work or because they couldnt qualify 
for medicaid if they made too much money 
and our medications are very expensive says workshop member 
nico angelo most of us are averaging some 3000 a month in 
bills 
aids alive originally was written for nine performers but 
the roles were reduced to five 
wed like to increase that to six or seven permanent roles with 
two or three understudies says carter inskeep who directed the 
show we are trying to find people to be backups swing people to 
learn several different roles in case someone gets sick 
its still very difficult to get people involved pippin 
says theres that element of disclosure about aids its still a 
big issue for some people 
one of the newer members of the troupe is buddy smith who joined 
the show when another performer got sick smith was given a new role 
with new lines and wasnt simply an understudy for the absent actor 
its a living theater piece pippin says it will never 
remain the same as people are added or leave the group the show 
changes 
now pippin and inskeep would like to expand the circle of 
performers adding women and drug users who have contracted aids 
but it has been hard to recruit members outside the gay community 
those in the troupe say their hard work and difficult decision to 
go public with their disease has been worth it 
i can only guess how awful things would have been for me 
without this show says tony torres so many things that happen 
to each one of us individually now can happen to somebody else 
tomorrow i have learned so much about what will happen to me later 
on so that it will easier for me to cope with it when it does 
happen 
the show gets me through he adds before we opened i was 
supposed to be in the hospital but i said no ive got a show to 
do

chinas decadeold economic revolution has 
brought sharp changes in peoples ambitions lifestyles and social 
mores 
whether in rapidly modernizing coastal cities such as ningbo with 
its hotels discos and highrise apartments or in nearby towns 
where peasants still thresh grain by hand chinese are saying the 
changes in their lives go far deeper than mere gains in income 
the surge in economic activity has brought new opportunities new 
risks and new rivalries as some people get rich faster than others 
one who epitomizes the new chinese dream of success is xu kaya 
a former peasant and assembly line worker he presides over one 
of the largest private companies in cixi a rural town outside 
ningbo his television parts factory will turn out 3 million yuan 
804000 worth of goods this year and he is a partner in a new 
chemical fibre factory being built 
he has a toshiba color television set a nissan sedan and a maid 
ten years ago xu was planting rice on a commune his dreams of 
studying medicine thwarted by the shutdown of universities by mao 
tsetungs 196676 leftist cultural revolution 
i learned to overcome difficulties and developed a strong 
desire to get ahead he said 
now 33 he spends 12 to 13 hours a days at his factory he has no 
time to think about joining the communist party once necessary for 
success in china 
i rely on my own ability he said 
nor does he fear political change 
if they call me a capitalist theyd have to call 70 percent of 
the population capitalists 
jiang yuenan a young cixi government worker agreed local 
farmers he said are always on the lookout for a profitable venture 
and most have more than one source of income 
some rent trucks to haul their produce 55 miles to ningbo a city 
of 1 million people for the best prices or to act as middlemen in 
business deals or buy up raw materials in one town to sell for 
profit in another 
such activities were politically suspect 10 years ago but they 
are now part of daily life in rural china 
city dwellers are not far behind 
zhang hangtie a barber is one of 60000 ningbo residents who 
have opened private businesses in the past decade and he revels in 
it both for the profits and the independence 
i am my own boss he said as he blowdried a customers hair 
in his tiny shop in the front room of a traditional twostory wood 
row house i wanted to get rich and now i can 
but not all chinese are able to that income differentials have 
widened sharply creating new social tensions rooted in jealousy 
a beijing newspaper reported the case of a woman factory worker 
who beat up a private tradesman on the street because she was 
angered by his flamboyant lifestyle private factory owners in 
several cities have been attacked and even killed by workers who 
accused them of exploitation for giving themselves higher salaries 
the world economic herald of teeming shanghai which is 125 miles 
north of ningbo said recently that many peoples expectations have 
far exceeded what is possible and the general sense of 
frustration is threatening to snowball 
some older chinese say the new opportunities came too late for 
them while they and others are reluctant to plunge into market 
competition and risk losing the guarantees of a staterun economy 
lifetime employment free medical care and subsidized food and 
housing 
yu jin a 26yearold cityemployed translator said hed thought 
about setting up a private translation service for foreign visitors 
to ningbo but feared giving up his secure government job 
one large group left behind in the reforms are intellectuals who 
survived decades of political suspicion in the mao years and now 
find themselves surpassed in income by zhang the barber and factory 
workers 
chen lianjun the 41yearold vice principal of the ningbo high 
school said she earns 180 yuan 48 a month including subsidies 
for food and books zhang earns 800 yuan 214 a month it seems 
unfair she said 
money isnt important said her husband wang wenhe also 41 
years old what counts are traditional values such as family and 
friends 
the young peoples thinking isnt like ours his wife said 
they dont like to suffer they want higher salaries and when 
they have vacations they want to travel its a new trend

beatrice arthur is pleased to play an 
oldfashioned love story with richard kiley although her view of it 
is anything but sentimental 
its like a geriatric doris day and rock hudson romance she 
says of the abc movie first love 
she plays a widow who a suitable time after the death of her 
husband pulls out some yellowing letters shes saved for years and 
gets in touch with her high school sweetheart to her astonishment 
their old romance is rekindled 
its a very sweet love story said arthur we dont get 
into any of the problems of the world people say oh its never 
been done before older people having a romance 
actually it has been done before katharine hepburn made several 
romantic movies at an age when most actresses are playing mothers or 
grandmothers 
over the weekend i was watching some doris day and rock hudson 
movie arthur said i said thats what we did 
the movie will air this sunday on abc besides arthur and kiley 
it stars joan van ark and anne francis it was filmed here and in 
new york 
when they first sent me the script for the movie i said its 
too simple she recalled its too simplistic gil cates said 
thats its charm no one has acne no one sweats he called it a 
fable its a fairy tale it was such a pleasure to do 
people keep telling me theyre surprised to see me do this kind 
of a role i guess its because i wasnt the stern maude or dorothy 
its refreshing to read a script like this so much of what you see 
is junk 
arthur who describes herself as one of the few actresses who 
doesnt dye her gray hair stars as dorothy in the nbc comedy hit 
golden girls she previously starred in maude 
at the time first love airs she will have just returned from 
london where she and golden girls costars betty white rue 
mcclanahan and estelle getty were invited to put on a special show 
for a royal command performance 
arthur was a tony awardwinning broadway star occasional feature 
film performer and a regular hand in george gobel and sid caesar tv 
variety shows before norman lear brought her west to star as 
maude in 1972 
people always judge you by what you did last she said 
dudley moore said to me i didnt know you sang he didnt know 
me when i was in the musical theater on broadway in drama school i 
did classical roles but it was hard to do classical roles on 
broadway 
i got a job singing in a nightclub i took myself very 
seriously everyone was trying to sound like lena horne julius monk 
was running the nightclub and he said youre so tall and 
imposing no ones going to take you seriously if you sing that your 
mans left you and youre going to throw yourself into the river 
she never did comedy until three penny opera 
i was hired as a singer she said the audience laughed at 
one song i was emoting and i couldnt believe it was funny then i 
started to relax and after that comedy came easy for me

the good mother 
 
female film stars in midcareer usually turn away from romantic 
roles to portray mothers a good example is joan crawford in her 
academy awardwinning mildred pierce the lone exception is 
katharine hepburn its hard to imagine her mothering a gaggle of 
squalling kids 
diane keaton began her transition as the career woman who 
inherited an infant in the successful baby boom now she turns 
dramatic in the good mother as a divorced mother caught in a 
custody battle with her former husband 
based on the bestselling novel by sue miller and written by 
michael bortman the film describes the life and background of the 
single mother who lives on returns from a humdrum laboratory job 
and the grudging child support payments of her ex played by james 
naughton flashbacks disclose the reason for her repressed 
sexuality her family had been dominated by an unfeeling 
dictatorial father ralph bellamy 
keaton meets liam neeson an attractive freeliving artist who 
releases her inhibitions with unbridled sex the idyll is destroyed 
when naughton appears to claim his 6yearold daughter in the 
custody suit he accuses the couple of having intercourse in the same 
bed where the girl was sleeping 
also because keaton sought sexual openness for her daughter 
neeson allowed the girl to satisfy her curiosity by touching his 
penis when she saw him stepping out of the shower this incident is 
not portrayed in the film 
keaton is represented in court by jason robards who warns that 
her case is perilous the trial is heartwrenching and the result 
should not be disclosed in a review 
leonard nimoy directed the good mother in an astounding 
change of pace from his last three men and a baby there is no 
humor in the new film and some patrons may be turned off by its 
seriousness 
the filmmakers deserve credit for attempting a drama of complex 
social issues the role of the single mother the question of how 
far sexual frankness should go but the issues become clouded and 
the outcome lacks the emotional impact of kramer vs kramer 
keaton is adept at portraying the mothers anguish employing few 
of her nervous mannerisms the irish actor liam neeson demonstrates 
his star potential in an ambiguous role and teresa wright offers 
welcome humanity as keatons mother 
arnold glimcher produced the touchstone film which is rated r 
because of language sex scenes and adult subject matter running 
time 103 minutes

childs play 
 
weaving children into tales of terror and the supernatural 
usually elevates the scare factor a decimal or two would we have 
been as horrified if linda had been a 30yearold instead of a 
school girl in the exorcist and damien in the omen sends 
more shivers up spines as a little boy than he does as a grownup 
in childs play a 6yearold takes on an evil doll 
andy barclay is a lonely lad until chucky comes into his life 
chucky is all the rage hes a good guy doll and every little boy 
has one chucky is just as cute as a button with his shock of red 
hair coveralls sneakers and wide innocent smile 
chucky also is a malevolent mound of plastic whose soul is pure 
evil 
it is the soul of a sadistic murderer who learns enough of a 
voodoo ritual to zap out of his body as it lay dying in a toy store 
and into the dolls so he can live forever and settle a few scores 
childs play is more than just an odyssey of revenge it is a 
chiller that will make you think twice about cuddling those ugly 
little cabbage patch kids or visiting barbies townhouse 
tom holland fright night who also wrote the screenplay 
with don mancini and john lafia plunges into the story with a 
fastbreak shootout in chicago between the psychotic charles lee ray 
brad dourif and police detective mike norris chris sarandon 
follows him into a toy store and slaughters ray with a hail of 
bullets ray though has one more trump card up his bloodied sleeve 
cut to the barclay home andy alex vincent is making breakfast 
and a major mess for his mom while he watches a good guys 
commercial on television its his way of buttering her up so he can 
get a doll for his birthday but mom a struggling clerk in a 
department store just cant afford it later that day her friend 
maggie takes her to a street peddler whos selling one for a 
fraction of the actual price it is of course the doll ray 
clutched as he died 
like most children in horror movies andy perceives evil long 
before the grownups do and knows that his life must depend on his 
own wits 
holland slowly develops the horror and first unleashes it when 
maggie dinah manoff babysits for andy after ordering andy to bed 
and turning off the late night news shes surprised to suddenly 
hear the tv and see chucky sitting in a chair before the set 
its not quite the heartstopper the next few scenes turn out to 
be with her back to the hall maggie hears tiny footsteps rushing 
by she thinks its andy silly woman and like all babysitters in 
these flicks shes the first to go chucky hammers in her head and 
she crashes through the sixthfloor window to the street below 
andy tells his mother karen catherine hicks that chucky told 
him maggie deserved to die she makes chucky talk but he only says 
the programmed words the manufacturer put in then karen discovers 
the batteries still in the dolls packing case she sneaks a look at 
chuckys empty battery case and with a turn almost as frightening 
as blairs head swirl in the exorcist chucky snarls at karen 
with a demonic sneer and tells her exactly what he thinks of her 
the terrors afoot climaxing in a scene that makes the cuisinart 
bit in the gremlins look like a picnic with mary poppins 
holland reteams with sarandon who starred as the vampire in 
night fright sarandons socalled tough urban accent is forced 
and a distraction from the action alex vincent is adorable in his 
film debut with his deep voice but the real star is chucky whos 
far more interesting than his human counterparts kevin yagher 
designed and supervised the operation of the killer doll 
childs play will not go down in horror movie history but it 
certainly has its moments

shakedown mca home entertainment vhsbeta 8995 rated r 
 
trashing new york citys sleazy 42nd street strip in a stupid 
chase scene is the emotional center of shakedown a violent 
improbable crime thriller that lasted five minutes in theaters and 
went immediately to videocassette 
it stars peter weller and sam elliott two talented and 
disciplined actors who must be thoroughly embarrassed by their 
involvement in this witless film but struggle vainly to breathe 
some humanity into twodimensional roles 
the name of the screenwriterdirector is being withheld to 
protect his career well all right its james glickenhaus thats 
glickenhaus 
this ugly little movie plays like a sadistic looney tune with 
35 crazy chase scenes a halfdozen explosions psychotic 
cartoonish behavior by practically everyone pointless vulgarity and 
mayhem 
elliott is the cop pal of weller a lawyer about to marry and 
work for his fiancees daddy on wall street his last case as a 
public defender is a selfdefense plea for a crack dealer whos 
killed a crooked cop in a drug deal 
of course the lawyers old flame is prosecuting the case and 
they hop into bed without a thought for the personal or legal ethics 
of the situation as the crooked cops close in on our heros there 
is much bashing and chasing and shooting and blowing up of things 
if thats what youre looking for this movie has it

the moderns nelson entertainment vhsbeta 8998 rated r 
 
why would a woman take a bath lathered in tiers of pearls its 
certainly not the best way to get the neck clean 
probably because linda fiorentino already had read this silly 
script and expected to be surprised by a nude keith carradine who 
moments before was downstairs trying to sell a painting to her 
artcollector husband bertram stone isnt it every womans fantasy 
to make love on the bathroom floor wearing pearls and patches of 
soap bubbles 
carradines character is called nick hart giving us hart vs 
stone so dont ask who will end up with lovely bathingbeauty 
rachel 
the raging husband john lone is abusive to rachel kicks hart 
in the face in a boxing ring after challenging him to a duel and 
burns modiglianis in the fireplace after first of course cutting 
one of the models breasts from the canvas because a critic said its 
nipple looked like a wart 
why does rachel stay with stone money hart a starving painter 
lives in a garret and even forges masters to survive he couldnt 
possibly buy the pouting languid rachel enough pearls in which to 
bathe 
besides this is bohemian paris of the 1920s and writerdirector 
alan rudolph presents these characters on the cutting edge of a new 
artistic era as singledimensional saps and lunatics 
he and cowriter jon bradshaw may have meant well but the 
archness and selfconscious pretension with which they translate 
avantgarde to the screen sets ones teeth on edge its difficult 
to decide if theyre insulting their audience or displaying their 
own intellectual shallowness probably both the constant lapsing 
into french with sporadic subtitles is difficult to deal with 
especially on the small screen the literary references are obscure 
enough that if you dont know them you wont know what youre not 
missing but when you do catch one its generally embarrassingly 
geewhiz 
the moderns is a nowin endeavor theres no enlightenment 
nor any loving treatment of artistic eccentrics 
minor characters including several drawn from real life float 
through as proof that this was paris and that it was bizarre 
gertrude stein and alice b toklas are spotted at their salon 
ernest hemingway is stupidly drunk in every bar 
genevieve bujold and geraldine chaplin give credibility to 
peripheral but stock roles wallace shawn plays oiseau a gossip 
columnist who dresses up like a dumpy middleaged woman so he can go 
unobserved to his own funeral where a graveside priest eulogizes 
him as having converted gossip into poetry 
oiseau gets off most of the goofier lines including telling hart 
at the railroad station i just ran into maurice ravel in the 
mens room but he didnt recognize me who would in those high 
heels and cloche hat 
oiseau sashays past kevin j oconnor playing the besotted 
hemingway who is mumbling lines that conclude with paris is a 
portable banquet 
you should work on that quips oiseau with the hindsight we 
all have that it utimately will read moveable feast 
as he and hart head back to the united states oiseau says hes 
glad to be leaving paris because the imitators are imitiating the 
imitators hollywood will be like a breath of fresh air

messiah is the most malleable of masterpieces and each 
season seems to bring a new interpretation 
this years version conducted by trevor pinnock comes from the 
ancient intsruments crowd it is completely different from last 
years messiah a jubilant rendition with a massive choir and 
roaring pipe organ conducted by andrew davis 
both are outstanding additions to a field already crowded with 
commendable recordings of george frideric handels most famous music 
pinnock approaches messiah more as a meditation than as a 
celebration the many virtues of this recording reach a peak of 
sublimity in he shall feed his flock sung by anne sofie von 
otter and arleen auger at six minutes this version is a full 
minute longer than in most recordings a daring choice that could 
fall absolutely flat unless done with the greatest taste and 
refinement 
the chorus and orchestra are superb and pinnocks version should 
have broad appeal far beyond earlymusic enthusiasts 
davis recording released a year ago cheerfully swam against 
the baroque tide with a big orchestra a huge chorus and a pipe 
organ thrown in for good measure this is messiah as the 
victorians loved it the sort of choral extravaganza that has only 
recently been overthrown by the authentic approach 
davis appears to have settled every interpretive choice in favor 
of the option that will make the listeners socks roll up and down 
with excitement kathleen battle for instance embellishes 
rejoice rejoice greatly with dozens of thrilling notes from the 
top of her range the pipe organ joining the frenzy in the 
hallelujah chorus is like heaping whipped cream on mince pie 
sinfully rich 
sir georg soltis version recorded in 1984 is also big but not 
invariably loud he used just 40 instruments from the chicago 
symphony plus a chorus of 100 kiri te kanawa who doesnt attempt 
some of battles vocal fireworks but has the richer riper voice is 
an asset of this version 
solti appears determined to put his distinctive mark on 
messiah notably by forcing the chorus to hush in some odd 
places in for unto us a child is born for instance why make a 
sharp decrescendo on prince of peace 
christopher hogwood went further out on the earlymusic limb with 
his messiah recorded in 1980 the brightness of the strings 
plus the sharpedged sound of the boy trebles of the christ church 
cathedral choir from oxford may grate on some listeners 
the hogwood version may have the strongest cast of soloists 
including sopranos judith nelson and emma kirkby and bass david 
thomas however thomas decision to sing incorrupteeble 
instead of the normal pronunciation of incorruptible in a 
trumpet shall sound is a minor annoyance 
the hogwood version is also available as a videotape recorded 
at several locations in westminster abbey 
john eliot gardiners messiah in 1982 is similar to 
pinnocks version in spirit and instrumentation gardiner is 
reticicent even in the hallelujah chorus which pinnock takes 
with customary gusto 
the early music style of messiah is now more than 20 years 
old dating to 1966 in this country with robert shaws rca recording 
with chorus and orchestra of about 30 each tha 1966 version a 
breaktrhough in its time stands up very well today 
indeed it sounds very much like shaws 1984 recording for telarc 
with the atlanta symphony orchstra and chamber chorus for this 
version shaw used 29 instrumentalists but doubled the chorus to 60 
such are the developments in performance in the past 20 years that 
the shaw version now sounds resolutely middleoftheroad 
a note on price pinnock davis shaw and solti fit messiah 
into two compact discs while gardiner and hogwood take three the 
third disc adds at least 14 to the purchase price

how does a young actor deal with suddenly 
being named an international star and the sexiest man alive 
you deal with it by a trick of the mind said mel gibson 
you figure is it worrying me that much does anybody else give a 
damn as much as i do so you decide not to its easy 
the gibson method appears to be working he seems totally 
unchanged from the time he first arrived here seven years ago after 
appearing as mad max in the australian movie the road warrior 
he still displays a hint of shyness contrasting with the 
selfassured roles he has played on the screen 
the actor was here for a publicity binge for his latest warner 
bros film tequila sunrise costarring kurt russell michelle 
pfeiffer and raul julia gibsons last role cast him as a los 
angeles cop in lethal weapon the new movie puts him back in los 
angeles but on the other side of the law 
things dont quite match up and thats what appealed to me 
about the script said gibson heres a man who has a very 
illicit lifestyle and has had an unsavory career yet he always 
tells the truth and deals honorably with people that makes an 
interesting combination 
the script doesnt deal with good and bad but shades of gray 
inbetween hes retired from drugdealing but nobody wants him 
to retire 
in tequila sunrise gibson is at odds with his high school 
buddy russell who is a narcotics cop pfeiffer is the beauty 
caught between them the writer is robert towne best known for 
writing chinatown he also directed tequila 
the script just lobbed into my mailbox one day said gibson 
it was one of those scripts that you just kept turning the pages 
you didnt know why it demanded a second read i liked it 
towne knows the meaning of the word economy he can write 
scenes that say a lot but dont have any words in the script 
theres a book of matches and an ash tray that say a lot no words 
needed 
gibson sounds totally american in the movie however in 
conversation the australian creeps in thats only natural for a 
fellow who spent his first 12 years in peekskill and mount vernon 
ny and the rest of his boyhood in sydney his mother was 
australian his father an american who decided to emigrate with his 
10 children so the older sons would not be drafted during the 
vietnam war 
taunted because of his yankee accent gibsons ruggedness allowed 
him to integrate he was going to be a chef or a journalist until 
his sister submitted him for a drama institute at the university of 
new south wales he appeared in stage plays and a cheapie flick 
summer city that attracted the eye of director george miller 
the result was the starmaking road warrior 
gibson filmed two sequels and also costarred in the acclaimed 
world war i film gallipoli and peter weirs the year of 
living dangerously his americanmade movies have been less 
successful the bounty the river mrs soffel only 
lethal weapon has lighted up the box office 
he still makes his home in australia and his wife robyn and 
their four young children usually travel with him 
i think travel is good for young kids he said its a good 
education for them as good as theyll get sitting in one place 
theyre still little aussies but i think they benefit from being 
exposed to different cultural elements attitudes and expressions 
they still speak australian though they get into a southern 
california twang when theyre here but i beat it out of them 
why not live here where the work is rather than australia 
well i dont have to live here australia is where i want to 
live its where the family is comfortable and thats where im 
comfortable he said 
gibson was part of the australian film boom about which he 
observed 
i think its tapered a bit they dont seem to have the same 
flowering industry they had in the late 70s and the beginning of 
this decade im sure theres a potential there theyve just 
started up a new film bank that has been around for a while but 
unfortunately it didnt have any money maybe when it gets cashed up 
they can make some good product

indiana jones and his swashbuckling treasure 
hunts would have been at home in egypt in the early 1800s when a 
mix of travelers and adventurers became by chance the worlds 
first egyptologists 
the calling still retained a lot of harrison fords movie 
character in 1922 when howard carter an eccentric briton dug into 
the most famous tomb of all the goldpacked burial place of pharaoh 
tutankhamon 
but as egyptology prepares to enter the 21st century the country 
that gave the science its name is asking modern lovers of its 
ancient past to give up the shovel and trowel dont dig and 
destroy egyptian antiquities officials are saying but restore and 
rebuild 
our grandfathers the ancient egyptians were reaching for 
eternity the acting chairman of the egyptian antiquities 
organization ma nureldin told the fifth annual international 
congress of egyptology its our task to let them remain eternal 
its time we looked on the ancient egyptians as subjects not just 
objects 
to thousands of years of wayfarers egypts monuments have seemed 
immortal a rich and glorious past paraded in stone monoliths and on 
tomb walls evidence is growing however that the immortality was 
fleeting time is running out 
new artifacts keep coming up at new digs but where are we 
going said egyptology professor faiza haikal we must leave the 
artifacts safely buried in the ground and restore and preserve 
what has been unearthed 
the once slow process of deterioration is accelerating we have 
the usual problems of environment and a rising water table but now 
the monuments face the spread of settlements with sewage and other 
risks 
most scholars are aware of and strongly support the changing 
face of egyptology its shift from seeking treasure to seeking 
knowledge many of todays egyptologists spend their days before 
delicately painted walls or engraved columns copying pictures and 
writings that are disappearing at a frightening rate 
others dig but in remote sites or at the edges of villages whose 
high birth rates demand the use of all available land whether or 
not history lies beneath it 
unlike the tomb of the boy pharoah tutankhamun discovered almost 
in tact and containing hordes of treasure beyond belief many sites 
in egypt contain only fragments only pottery pieces rich enough 
for the scholar but perhaps not substantial enough to raise funds 
for the ever increasing price of mounting expeditions 
hundreds of subjects tantalize modern egyptologists ranging from 
pyramid research and the sphinx to the secret language of the 
baboons egypt in the old testament magic in ancient egypt adverbs 
and adverb clauses the position of tutankhamuns feathered corselet 
against iconographical sources the role of the handicapped people 
in ancient egypt the transition from tribe to state and some 
aspects of the use of honey in ancient egypt 
the profession has come a long way from the image of the solitary 
egyptologist trotting over desert sands on his faithful donkey 
windblasted and poor trying to fight off eternitystarved mummies 
and antiquities smugglers with baskets of tana leaves 
gamal mokhtar director for the international effort to save the 
monuments of nubia during the 1960s has witnessed many of the 
changes including the passing of egypts heritage from foreign to 
local hands and items of national heritage required to be kept in 
egypt 
egyptology as a science began after different evils he said 
you had monumental neglect of the monuments from the days of the 
pharoahs then you had christians and the monuments on religious 
grounds 
then you had napoleon bonaparte bringing with him in his 
attempt to conquer egypt hundreds of artists and scientists who 
awakened the eyes of the world to the glories that still could be 
found in egypt 
hundreds came either to study or steal he said then in 1799 
the rosetta stone with its ancient greek and egyptian inscriptions 
was found providing a key to deciphering the hidden meaning of 
ancient egyptian writing hieroglyphics 
mokhtar has also witnessed high technology replacing hands in an 
attempt to locate hidden artifacts satellite photos provide what 
years of walking might never show in some large sites instruments 
replace the questioning mind showing just the spot where buried 
history can be found though seldom indicating exactly what lies 
below 
but for most egyptologists dirtunderthe fingernails is still 
where its at 
you know what things are by touching them said archaeologist 
and egyptologist michael jones you wont know what glass is 
except when you feel it though high technology has its place 
for the past five years jones and his wife egyptologist angelea 
milward have searched for clues to one of the most important 
religious relics in ancient egypt the apis bull on a site 
surrounded by a village some 45 minutes south of cairo 
though they were not searching for treasure and have found 
nothing of great value they are content that they have added facts 
missing from the pages of ancient egypt 
up until the 19th century much of ancient egypt was frozen in 
time jones said because there was wealth still buried in 
egypt people came looking for goodies and found them its a great 
tragedy because lay people nowadays are mesmerized knocked over 
backwards by tutankhamun and the famous statues 
for todays egyptologist working in the field the goal is to 
band together the facts in order to reveal a three dimensional side 
to what has been found 
but its difficult jones said because many of the 
artifacts have been taken from their home we have parts of 
monuments other parts remaining in museums and elsewhere out of 
egypt physical remains are often seen in isolation 
imagine someone 3000 years from now trying to recreate our 
world 
jones said there are few shortcuts in his profession he walks 
and walks his site then walks it again trying to turn back the 
clock 
you get to know your site the way you know your house he 
said 
whats happening in egyptology is the ancient egyptians are no 
longer the curiosities they once were you can meet them via 
archaeology and not in the fancified terms egyptologists used in the 
old days 
you try to understand them in their own environment youre not 
just digging up artifacts youre digging up people

bangle susanna hoffs mom invoked the dreaded 
mword when her daughter recently played her groups latest 
album everything for her 
she thought it as more sophisticated and mature than the 
bands first two records hoffs said 
maturity may be a dirty word for many rockers and hoffs quickly 
disavowed her mothers language but its an apt description for 
both the records sound and the approach the bangles took in 
recording their first album in almost three years 
after two lps and seemingly endless rounds of touring the 
bangles say they finally feel comfortable with their craft 
were learning to trust ourselves more to be more emotional in 
our performance said bass player michael steele i dont really 
know if you can call it maturity its more of an artistic growth 
the four women of the bangles who pay homage to classic bands of 
the 1960s with their sunny melodies and intricate harmonies became 
stars with such hits as walk like an egyptian and the prince 
tune manic monday from the 1986 lp different light 
the bangles are thankful for their success but said they needed 
to take greater control over their music 
producer david kahne whose relationship with the band was stormy 
at best was replaced by davitt sigerson hoffs steele and sisters 
vicki and debbi peterson who once readily accepted contributions 
from outside songwriters each wrote or cowrote all of the new 
albums 13 songs 
when all four members of a band write songs they notice when 
their biggest hits are written by someone else walk like an 
egyptian was written by liam sternberg if she knew what she 
wants is a jules shear song and the bangles hit the top 10 with a 
cover of paul simons hazy shade of winter 
it was a reaction to the success of different light that made 
us determined to write as many songs as we could come up with 
strong stuff that we could feel was emotionally attached to us 
steele said we had a strange slight feeling of distance from 
different light 
the flip side to trusting your own instincts of course is 
getting burned if the public rejects you some critics have grumbled 
that everything sounds overproduced and the songs dont sparkle 
but the publics responding to the first single a hoffs rocker 
called in your room which is moving swiftly up the charts 
the bangles say they liked the songs they wrote for this album so 
much they couldnt bear to throw any away hoffs said it costs the 
band money to pack the record with 13 songs instead of the 
traditional 10 
the thought of not having those extra three tracks on the 
record just to save money makes no sense to me hoffs said id 
rather put out a record that we truly love 
thats why we got into it in the first place steele said 
were really oriented toward the music 
i got into it because of the fashion hoffs said lampooning 
her colleagues cliche 
i do it for the boys steele shot back 
they may joke about it but the bangles say theyre tired of 
defending themselves against people who denigrate their musical 
ability because theyre women 
the bangles knew sigerson whos produced rickie lee jones and 
david amp david through mutual friends 
we liked davitt immediately hoffs said hes been a 
songwriter and hes from that orientation we felt more comfortable 
with someone we could talk to about our songs 
those songs are generally the typical pop music fare of love won 
and lost with a few twists and turns in glitter years steele 
reminisces about the mid70s california rock scene and laments some 
of its drug casualties in the ballad eternal flame hoffs said 
she used roy orbison and patsy cline as role models 
we just sort of let each song lead us down whatever path it 
would lead us like putting on a blindfold and just going hoff 
said theres no formula i wish sometimes there was everytime i 
write something i rewrite it a billion times 
hoffs said the bangles feel grateful to get their songs on the 
radio since the singles charts are dominated by young heavy metal 
bands and dance music 
we grew up hearing the byrds and beatles jimi hendrix and the 
doors on the radio steele said radio to us has never been a 
plastic sellout 
the bangles will spend much of 1989 touring to support a record 
they say even moms and dads can love they know because theyve 
asked theirs 
i played it for my dad steele said he said this is a 
much more professionalsounding record

leon uris has based much of his work on 
historical events in mitla pass the history is his own 
i was looking for a legacy to leave my new family and my 
grandchildren said uris the 64yearold author of such best 
sellers as exodus and qb vii 
mitla pass doubleday 1995 which closely follows the 
lives of uris and his family begins in israel in 1956 during the 
time of the suez canal crisis and centers on the experiences of the 
authors alter ego gideon zadok a writer covering the incident 
the novel then traces zadoks ancestry back to the 1880s allowing 
various relatives to tell their stories 
uris lives in aspen colo with his third wife jill and hopes 
the book will bring him closer to their two children 
i wanted to leave them with a story of what their old man did 
and let them know he was not infallible you spend the second 
half of your life getting over your first half he said 
i want them to learn that their daddy gets frightened that he 
makes mistakes i wanted to humanize the relationship very early 
uris quickly points to his own experience in mitla pass the 
writer had difficulties with both parents 
those relationships took me 60 years to get some understanding 
their relationship with me that hurt me a great deal brought me a 
great deal of pain as a child what i long for is a better 
relationship with my own children 
like zadok uris was born in baltimore and spent several years 
growing up in norfolk va his father wolf william was a paper 
hanger and storekeeper uris remembered him as an unhappy man 
i think his personality was formed by the harsh realities of 
being a jew in czarist russia he said he was basically a 
failure he went from failure to failure i think failure formed his 
character made him bitter 
i think i can say without hesitation that from earliest memory 
i was determined not to be a failure 
uris credits his mother anna with teaching him an appreciation 
of the arts but says they did not get along 
her life was such that there was a heavy distrust of men in 
large part because of a very cruel father we were essentially 
disinterested in each other she was inside of her own head there 
somewhere 
uris struggled to establish his own independence and world world 
ii provided the perfect opportunity 
all societies that i know of are shaped by macho the need of a 
man to be macho said uris who served as a marine theres no 
better proving ground than a war the war came along at a time when 
i needed to go war my time had run out at being at home the war 
worked into my life 
after the war he began submitting articles to magazines and 
finally had a piece the all american razzmatazz published in 
the january 1951 issue of esquire 
his first novel battle cry a story about the marine corps 
was released in 1953 and made into a film two years later he came 
out with the angry hills a spy novel and in 1956 traveled to 
israel to begin research on exodus his most famous work the 
novel which depicted the history of european jewry from the turn of 
the century to the establishment of israel was released in 1958 and 
sold millions of copies 
exodus has been the bible of the jewish dissident movement in 
russia uris said its referred to as the book 
uris has also written about the warsaw ghetto resistance in 
mila 18 postworld war ii germany in armageddon and the 
cuban missile crisis in topaz for trinity the story of 
three irish families from the mid19th century to the easter rising 
of 1916 uris was given the irish institutes john f kennedy award 
in 1976 
but now the author wants to deal with more personal matters 
my motivation is to be on a oneandone basis with my readers 
to say look im old enough and wise enough to work in this area 
of human relationships this is what the worlds all about other 
people he said 
uris said researching mitla pass made him see himself in an 
entirely different way i used to think of myself as a very sad 
little jewish boy isolated in a southern town undersized 
asthmatic 
when i read all my correspondence again i realized i was a 
hustler he said i was tough i used everything to my 
advantage i could be very ruthless i hurt a lot of people on the 
way up 
now he said smiling im mellowed out 
to research mitla pass uris pored through 100000 pieces of 
correspondence a process that was physically and emotionally 
exhausting 
it was painful i would get to my office at noon and be dead 
asleep on my couch at 2 i was so depressed this book drained me 
yet once he began writing mitla pass the words came easily 
so much was stored up for so long that i almost set the 
typewriter on automatic uris said its a wild structure but 
its the way i wrote the first time around 
his books are usually enormous in scope covering extensive 
periods of time and requiring painstaking research he has been 
criticized for an overblown writing style and for making his 
characters onedimensional 
but readers have been unable to resist his epic tales 
i have a good relationship with my readers uris said if 
you havent anything to say you sit down and shut up i feel i have 
something to say that has value

cindy walker the queen of country 
music songwriters has spent about half a century writing 
recognizable songs that have been recorded by such performers as 
elvis presley and bing crosby 
the veteran composer who lives in mexia texas has written more 
than 450 songs that have been recorded she was a finalist this year 
for induction into the country music hall of fame 
the best tunes she said in a telephone interview are songs 
with a face 
you recognize them you know them its like a person they 
have a face thats outstanding other songs dont have a face you 
just hear them thats all the really good ones are few and far 
between 
two of her best known songs are you dont know me and dream 
baby 
you dont know me has been recorded by more than 75 singers 
including presley ray charles eddy arnold jerry vale and mickey 
gilley walker wrote the song in the mid1950s after arnold 
suggested the title although he had no music or lyrics to go with 
it 
i was in nashville for a music convention and he said ive 
got a title for you he said youve got to promise me to write it 
i was flippant about it the title because it didnt strike me at 
the time she said 
its about someone you think you know but you dont i came on 
home and two months later i was sitting in my chair in my studio 
and that song just started singing itself i was just carried away 
with it 
it took me three weeks to finish then i called eddy and sang 
it over the phone to him he had forgotten about it but he recorded 
it three weeks later 
her song dream baby was written in the mid 1960s and was a 
hit by roy orbison and later glen campbell among others 
its been recorded by lots of people she said i hate to 
name names because i leave someone out 
some of her other songs include in the misty moonlight 
take me in your arms and hold me china doll and tunes with 
a western flavor such as blue canadian rockies my rancho rio 
grande lone star trail and youre from texas 
for the king of western swing music bob wills she wrote 
bubbles in my beer cherokee maiden and dusty skies 
her first big break though came in 1942 when she accompanied 
her father a cotton buyer on a trip to hollywood they drove past 
the crosby building and she decided to try to make an appointment 
with bing crosby 
i went into the office and asked for mr crosby she 
recalled the secretary said larry or which one i didnt know 
there was but one so i asked for the first one said named it was 
larry he listened and i sang him the song he said bing had been 
looking for a western song he said meet me here tomorrow and 
well let him hear it i did 
as a result lone star trail was recorded by bing crosby and 
became her first song recorded by someone else 
it started me off she said 
later she signed her own recording contract with decca records 
for five years she was a performer and songwriter and appeared in a 
few movies but eventually decided to concentrate on composing 
ive always been a songwriter she said everything was an 
offshoot from my writing 
her procedure has been to think of a title and then go from there 
the title tells the story if you can get a real good title 
youve got something i always write from the title ive never 
written a song without the title 
melodies flow from the lyrics she said 
the words and music come together it just sort of comes to 
you the songs just sing themselves to me they kind of write 
themselves i just stand back and listen 
walker who gives her age as old enough to know better and 
young enough not to care is still writing her song sugar 
moon has recently been recorded by country stars willie nelson 
janie frickie and kd lang 
i write all the time its all ive ever done she said

why use a book to teach children about the life 
cycle of the butterfly when they can witness metamorphosis 
one is an aesthetic hairraising experience that is just 
absolutely dramatic beyond belief the other all it is is just 
reading another set of symbols said francis m pottenger iii 
director of science projects for the curriculum research and 
development group at the university of hawaii 
substituting words for natures wonders unfortunately is what 
most of science has been over the years said pottenger you 
destroy science that way you literally destroy science by putting 
it into that form 
pottenger 60 a former high school science teacher has 
developed a teaching program that replaces books with real world 
lessons developmental approaches in science and health integrates 
science health and technology with subjects such as literature and 
social studies 
dash is the elementary equivalent to his foundational approaches 
in science teaching a middle school program used by more than 1200 
districts nationwide 
he had started fast in 1966 with money from the university of 
hawaii and the state to take advantage of hawaiis natural 
museum environment it was introduced in hawaii in 1970 and spread 
to the mainland in 1976 being tailored to reflect each districts 
needs and natural surroundings 
we wanted to look at the real world in which the child lived 
rather than the textbook world pottenger said 
in dash instead of lecturing on the importance of sanitation 
for example teachers are encouraged to whip up some germy goo 
out of cocoa and cooking oil that children can dip their fingers 
into while listening to a poem or two 
there once was a terrible germ who was long and looked like a 
worm his favorite trick was to get people sick so theyd lie on 
their back and squirm 
such strategies work wonders said ann baldwin taylor director 
of the childrens school at carnegie mellon university a campus 
laboratory school for research in child development 
if language arts and math and science and younameit are all 
together all of a sudden the kids click click click she 
said snapping her fingers oh i get it i understand and i can 
use it here here here and here 
kindergarten teacher gloria cannon whose laboratory school is 
affiliated with the state university of new york at buffalo is just 
as enthusiastic about what she calls dashs whole world and 
capturingthemoment approach it allows for the individual 
its not this is the right answer or the wrong answer there are 
many right answers for the same thing and many ways to solve one 
particular problem cannon said 
the trick is getting students to see how science touches their 
lives 
once the child understands and can use the material to 
understand their world around them theyre hooked for life ms 
taylor said its when the child doesnt understand that you 
lose them they just turn it off 
dash was incorporated this fall into kindergarten and firstgrade 
curriculums at 10 laboratory schools which are the same as any 
other school except for affiliation with universities course 
materials are expected to be ready for grades two through six in 
1991 it eventually will be offered like fast to public schools 
willing to buy the material and have their teachers trained by a 
special team of instructors 
the major problem has been that elementary teachers generally 
have been frightened by science because they are fearful theyre 
going to make a mistake pottenger said its much easier to 
return to the textbook which gives all the proper answers 
with dash he said teachers look not so much at textbook 
answers but real phenomenon the phenomenon tell you whether or not 
you have actually a proper interpretation

the 8monthold wasnt fooled when the 
stopwatch that had looked so interesting was covered with a cloth 
he yanked the cloth away 
but research under way around the country suggests he might not 
have been so savvy if he hadnt yet begun to crawl 
parents know that children experience all kinds of new things 
once they begin to crawl the taste of the cats food the allure of 
their sisters room 
but psychologists say crawling also seems to trigger a variety of 
developmental milestones babies reach between the ages of six and 
nine months they learn that toys still exist even when hidden 
heights can be dangerous and objects exist that have nothing to do 
with themselves 
psychologists have attributed such advances to maturation of the 
nervous system but the new research is finding that developmental 
changes dont occur before babies are mobile even if crawling is 
delayed several months 
its nothing short of a psychological revolution said 
rosanne kermoian assistant professor of psychology at reed college 
were finding that not only are the changes very dramatic theyre 
also very broad 
we think its not crawling itself but the experiences that 
are associated with crawling they have to pay attention to where 
they are located in space so when they go room to room they dont 
get lost 
the research has implications for babies delayed in crawling by 
handicaps or injuries kermoian said they dont display the 
developmental changes until they begin to crawl even if that occurs 
several months later than average 
infants who arent yet crawling but get around in a walker show 
more of the developmental advances than those who arent mobile at 
all and those who never crawl but go directly to walking display 
the changes when they begin to walk 
there are certain very specific areas where they are 
developmentally delayed she said if we can show where the 
better we will be able to develop appropriate therapeutic 
intervention 
the research shows that crawling also seems to trigger babies 
understanding that they arent the center of the universe she said 
what we find is that as children gain experience crawling they 
understand better what the mother is communicating about other 
things that are going on in the world thats a huge change if a 
mother points the child looks to the event rather than looking 
at the mothers finger or her face 
kermoian has a wall full of stuffed animals to test whether 
babies follow their parents gazes or pointing fingers to the toys 
or whether they will look only at their parents this also 
translates into watching their parents reactions to new people 
before responding to them 
theyre more likely to use the mother to decide what is an 
appropriate response she said at this age that behavior 
isnt perfect but were beginning to see it in babies that are 
beginning to locomote 
mobility also seems to teach babies wariness of heights and 
relationships between objects kermoian said 
collaborating in the study are robert telzrow of the university 
of washington joseph campos of the university of illinois and 
bennett bertenthal of the university of virginia

george hitchings knew right 
away that gertrude elion was special 
we had maybe four or five interviews for this job as an 
assistant in the biochemistry department hitchings recalled 
but after i talked to trudy i told the research director this 
is the one were looking for 
elion 70 also clearly remembers that meeting 
george didnt ask me any questions i had three other job 
offers and they had all asked what the last book was that i had 
read and that sort of thing george never did he just started 
talking about what they were doing he was so excited about it that 
i thought this is the place i want to work 
that 1944 job interview launched a lifelong collaboration 
developing medicines for leukemia malaria gout herpes and kidney 
transplant rejection a collaboration that led to a share of this 
years nobel prize for medicine 
when we started it was all trial and error hitchings said 
youd develop a compound and take some kind of target usually a 
mouse plug it in and see what it did or didnt do over the last 
40 years there has been more shifting to our system 
hitchings and elions rational approach involves probing the 
chemistry behind a disease and then developing chemical compounds to 
fight it 
elion said she and hitchings had been successful partners for 44 
years because they just kept working there was no time for 
anything else 
and neither of them was concerned about who got the credit 
as the scope of our work grew and i took on assistants of my 
own we would spend a lot of time talking through a problem she 
said by the end of our discussions wed usually come up with an 
approach but neither one of us would remember who had originally 
come up with the approach there never was any of this oh that 
was my idea between us 
elion never married and hitchings a widower since 1985 are 
officially retired from burroughs wellcome but they both report 
every day when theyre not on the road lecturing people around 
here just laugh when i say im retired elion said i do like to 
stay busy 
whats the use of retiring if you dont have anything to 
contribute any more people will tell you but as long as you can 
make a contribution you should science is a continuum if the 
older ones dont pass along their knowledge to the younger ones it 
comes to a dead stop

advances in computer imaging 
techniques and biomedical research will significantly expand the use 
of custommade joint and bone implants in the coming years 
specialists say 
the technology and research is moving at a far greater pace 
than we expected said orthopedic surgeon dr david stulberg one 
of several hundred doctors reseachers and other specialists at the 
first international symposium on custommade prostheses here last 
month 
we have learned that a great deal is being done in europe that 
we can profit from said stulberg of northwestern university in 
chicago 
he said he was impressed by a method developed by west berlin 
researchers to reduce the distortion in test images of implanted 
metal joints allowing doctors to better judge the success of the 
operation 
custommade joint replacements are a relatively new development 
in orthopedic surgery and their use is not yet widespread stulberg 
said the use of custommade joint replacements is growing by 
about 100 percent a year their use will spread as orthopedic 
surgeons learn more about them 
followup studies of patients who have received custommade 
joints indicate they perform better than traditional off the shelf 
prostheses he said 
most replacement hip knee ankle elbow shoulder and finger 
joints are made in a small range of sizes designed to fit 
averagesized patients however such devices dont fit all patients 
and certain medical conditions require the use of a custommade 
prostheses 
with the use of sophisticated computer and design technology the 
devices can be constructed to give a near perfect fit said 
clyde pratt president of techmedica a camarillo calif company 
that makes replacement joints 
we think this is the method of the future pratt said adding 
that the costs of custommade devices should go down as research 
costs decline customfitted joints now can cost up to twice as much 
as noncustom replacements

40 years there has been more shifting to our system 
hitchings and elions rational approach to pharmacology 
involves probing the chemistry behind a disease and then developing 
chemical compounds to fight it 
hitchings had been working on nucleic acids at burroughs wellcome 
corp for two years as the companys only biochemist when he hired 
elion 
she had a masters degree in chemistry from new york university 
at the time and went parttime for two or three years but my 
professor told me if i wanted a phd i would have to go fulltime 
i told him i couldnt do that because i liked my job too much 
hitchings however had no reservations about her abilities 
thats the great thing about industry he said pointing to 
other scientists at burroughs wellcome who do not have doctorates 
i think that is maybe more important in academia than it is here 
besides she could have had a doctorate at any time there was 
never any question about that elion later was awarded honorary 
doctorates making her in her words an honest woman 
elion wanted a career in research but ended up teaching high 
school among other jobs after earning a chemistry degree from hunter 
college world war ii helped her get into the field she wanted 
at the time women really werent expected to go into those 
kinds of jobs she said but the war had taken all the men so 
that gave me my opportunity 
hitchings too had wandered through other jobs at harvard and 
western reserve universities before getting the work he wanted in 
research i got my doctoral degree at harvard at the bottom of 
the depression there simply were no jobs really so i kind of 
pieced together a living until burroughs wellcome came along in the 
back of my mind i knew what i wanted to do 
elion said she and hitchings had been successful partners for 44 
years because they just kept working there was no time for 
anything else 
and neither of them was concerned about who got the credit 
as the scope of our work grew and i took on assistants of my

said by the end of our discussions wed usually come up with an

elion never married and hitchings a widower since 1985 are 
officially retired from burroughs wellcome but they both report 
every day when theyre not on the road lecturing people around 
here just laugh when i say im retired elion said i do like to 
stay busy 
hitchings also has stayed busy with charity my life now is 
about onethird philanthropy and twothirds science he said 
in 1983 he founded the greater triangle community foundation a 
confederation of charities that make grants to area nonprofit 
agencies his 130000 share of the nobel prize will go to the 
george and beverly hitchings endowment established by friends and 
relatives for the foundation in 1985 to mark his 80th birthday 
hitchings met his wife when he moved from his home state of 
washington to study for his doctorate at harvard he took a room in 
the home of a methodist minister and one of the ministers 
daughters beverly caught his eye 
within a few weeks we were committed for life hitchings 
said she was my greatest encouragement and biggest fan 
she also kept a close eye on him when he became too involved with 
research sometimes taking their two children to the lab to drag him 
out to dinner 
i remember one morning i got up and made a sandwich stuck it 
in my pocket and headed down to the lab i figured it must be some 
kind of holiday because there wasnt anyone around but me 
i worked all day ate my sandwich at lunch and when i got 
home beverly said george do you realize you just spent new 
years day at the lab i really hadnt thought of it 
elion created an extended family of young scientists and serves 
as a doting aunt to her nieces and nephews and their children 
my brother had the foresight to marry and have four children 
she said of her brother herbert a physicist who lives in 
california i was fairly onesided spending most of my time 
working 
shes always been aunt trudy to my family too hitchings 
said 
an opera buff she makes frequent trips to new york her 
hometown she also is an avid world traveler one of my friends 
said it would make a shorter list if i just put down the places i 
havent been she said 
elion said she had no regrets that her work had kept her from a 
normal family life i might have if what i was doing was not 
so much fun my mother used to ask me the same thing id bring work 
home on the weekend and shed always say does your boss know 
youre bringing work home every weekend

from the start barb goldmans recipe for 
scallops didnt have a chance 
out they came steaming hot and fresh from one of the 10 test 
kitchens for better homes and gardens magazine served in tiny 
portions for a group of food editors gathered in a taste test 
i think its pretty watery and the sauce doesnt stick to the 
pasta said ms goldman a senior associate food editor using 
outlines from other recipes she had assembled a group of recipes to 
appear in better homes next spring but first they had to pass the 
magazines test kitchen test 
everyone at the table agreed about the consistency so the 
question became whether to reduce the amount of sauce or keep the 
volume and make it thicker in its second test it was decided the 
recipe will include two teaspoons of cornstarch which helps 
coagulate sauces 
someone else said the dish didnt have much sass so a bit of 
lemon pepper was added shredded carrots will be substituted for red 
peppers next time 
and so it went for the other recipes as well each was tested for 
taste appearance nutritional value and ease of preparation and 
each was sent packing with a list of changes the adjusted recipes 
will be prepared and tested again to be published only after the 
testers are satisfied 
uncounted magazines send out recipes and many have their own test 
kitchens but better homes circulation about 8 million says it has 
the largest test operation 
some 11200 recipe tests are done each year and each is tested 
at least twice the second time with changes ordered by the food 
testers almost all of the ingredients are readily available 
national brands 
our recipes are very doable for a wide variety of cooks from 
the beginner to the accomplished cook says nancy byal executive 
food editor for better homes when we print a recipe we guarantee 
that it will not only work but it will taste good 
people do have limited time and if they prepare one of our 
recipes they know they wont have a failure says sharon 
stilwell director of the test kitchens 
if we tell them it takes 20 minutes to do then it will take 20 
minutes she says unless the phone rings or something 
to make sure the recipes are doable the test kitchens are set 
up to resemble the ones in average homes with normalsized ranges 
and other appliances the cooks are home economists skilled in 
different types of food preparation but theyre also attuned to the 
abilities of their readers 
we have to make it foolproof so it works every time says ms 
byal the cooks at home she says have neither the time nor the 
temperament to experiment with complex recipes that need tinkering 
she says the business of publishing recipes has come a long way 
since the first one by better homes went out in 1922 six years 
before the test kitchens were established that early recipe told 
cooks to mix berries put them in a shell and heat the combination 
until it became a pie 
there was nothing on adding sugar or even on how long to cook 
it says ms byal explaining that the turnofthecentury cook 
had enough knowledge to fill in the blanks 
cooks today have less time to prepare meals and they demand 
recipes of greater variety and nutritional value she says 
ms stilwell says the tests aim for unbiased results they wont 
rule out green peppers just because one tester doesnt like them 
for example and the milder foods will get their tests ahead of 
dishes that might dominate the palate such as sweet or spicy hot 
items 
the testers say regional tastes are not a factor although the 
testers are midwestern most have broad food experience 
you name it theyve seen it says ms goldman of the food 
editors these are very sophisticated food people 
special testers are assembled for special tastes however we 
know who the fire mouths are around here and who are the baby 
mouths says ms stilwell the fire mouths would be assembled to 
test chili recipes to judge recipes aimed at children the editors 
assembled a batch of children to do the testing 
on rare occasions says ms byal a recipe appearing in better 
homes doesnt meet the magazines standards 
but mostly the testers said the problem with recipes that dont 
work is that the cooks dont follow directions 
the editors told stories of cooks who tried to take a little 
sugar out of the jelly recipe to make it lowcalorie ending up with 
sauce that never coagulated another got unusual results by trying 
to substitute diet margarine 
to me its kind of a challenge a mystery to find out what 
went wrong says ms byal

one sunday evening in alaska upscale 
anchorage restaurateur jens hansen proudly served rare saddle of 
chamois to the venerable gourmet society confrerie de la chaine des 
rotiseurs 
for that gastronomical victory and the finding and delivery of 
the rare antelope meat on short notice hansen had to thank the 
suburban san francisco storefront night bird game amp poultry co 
which can supply shoulder of black bear with the ease of a 
supermarket selling a chuck roast 
night bird is a standout but not alone among the nations 10 
billion gourmet specialty businesses that provide exotic food and 
drink for an american public increasingly on the lookout for 
trappings of the good life 
it was amazing said hansen both of the juicy roasts and 
night bird founder gerald e prolmans ability to find a 50pound 
cache of the rare meat in new zealand the gustatory brotherhood 
raved about it said hansen 
for prolman americans who look for quality in what they eat must 
include such unlikely critters as rattlesnake bear alligator 
buffalo and beaver and such toothsome fungi as shiitakes morels 
and chanterelles 
night bird supplies some of the bestknown restaurants in america 
with meat raised for the table for prolman a topclass 
chefturnedsupplier his business in san bruno just south of san 
francisco is an ongoing effort to convince americans that game is 
not an exotic category it is essential on a wellbalanced classical 
menu 
food specialists looking for simple answers regularly sneer that 
this country has no cuisine of its own barring fried chicken hot 
dogs chili and the like but these doomsayers are wrong says a man 
in the know 
i think america is defining a cuisine at last says narsai 
david a chef author talk show host and restaurateur 
in general the incredible amount and variety of fresh foods 
available in all parts of the united states comprise this nations 
culinary philosophy thats unlike france or italy for example 
where theres a set style for the preparation of food said david 
another gourmet success story is the yearold san franciscobased 
heritage kitchen specialty foods which annually produces 3 million 
effie marie rumsoaked cakes dripping in butter and calories 
from bloomingdales in new york to marshall fields in chicago and 
macys nationwide the outrageous twopound desserts sell for 
1750 a copy to make sure every possible american gets properly 
hooked heritage kitchen gives away samples of its golden vanilla 
spiced apple walnut lemon poppyseed and chocolate fudge to 180000 
people a year 
burberrys the british firm best known for its clothing exports 
this fall introduced a collection of fine english foods to specialty 
food stores and departments throughout the united states 
the product lineup both individual items and gift packs 
includes british teas biscuits shortcakes preserves marmalades

hospital food long considered in the mediocre 
genre that includes airline and school cafeteria fare is having a 
coming out party 
make that going out as in catering 
although still uncommon hospitals are catering weddings picnics 
and graduation parties a trend could develop as more hospital 
kitchens get into the act 
people are going to want to be sick to come to bicounty 
says wally wozniak assistant director of food and services of 
bicounty hospital in the detroit suburb of warren 
the menu at bicounty stays away from the traditional fried 
chicken and roast beef 
we serve different types of chicken such as champagne chicken 
or chicken cacciatore you can have quiche everyday if you want 
wozniak says 
you can also choose buttered egg noodles with parsley instead of 
mostaccioli pasta 
five seattlearea hospitals offer espresso and cappuccino on 
site a bloomington ind hospital has done so well with its bakery 
that restaurants purchase cookies and cakes from them 
hospitals in california oregon and illinois plan similar 
operations says jan shulman of the american hospital association in 
chicago 
apparently even the experts are finding hospital food to their 
liking 
northern dutchess hospital in rhinebeck ny catered a staff 
picnic for the culinary institute of america among the countrys 
most prestigious schools for chefs shulman says 
just as in a restaurant a hostess at chicagos northwestern 
memorial hospital visits all patients after their meals are served 
to ensure the food is satisfactory and the patient received 
everything that was ordered 
being rather new success depends mainly on word of mouth that 
is spreading quickly 
we have been doing this for over a year and have been pretty 
successful most of our business comes from referrals from past 
users weve done weddings showers graduation and office 
parties says wozniak who has a degree in hotel and restaurant 
management 
elaine havern had her wedding catered by the hospital 
the food was excellent people were asking where it had come 
from says havern whose previous caterer canceled seven weeks 
before the wedding 
there was nothing traditional about the menu she says we 
had beef tenderloin and chicken almondine it was more gourmet 
and the competition for the new business is keen shulman says 
hospitals are trying to create an environment where someone can 
choose one hospital over another she says they want to make 
the experience a pleasant one

an alaska beverage producer hoping for 
spirited competition with the soviets has begun bottling vodka made 
with glacier water 
mark wilson president of alaska mountaintop spirits co said 
the attakiska vodka that his firm began bottling in november will be 
sold intially in alaska and in eastern states with sales later 
expected to reach other parts of the united states plus some pacific 
rim nations 
wilson said he expects an immediate monthly demand for 2000 to 
3000 cases of the new vodka three percent of total sales are 
targeted for alaska he said 
while people are on the whole drinking less they are more 
discriminating in what they are drinking wilson said todays 
consumer is more sophisticated and is willing to spend the few extra 
dollars it takes to buy the best vodka available 
he also said he is relying on the alaska mystique to draw people 
to the product for a firsttime sip 
the mystique and character of alaska will be key to breaching 
the stronghold of the established market leaders wilson said 
the production process is described as one that takes the soviet 
method a step further through use of the pure and distinctive 
glacier waters available in alaska and through a special finishing 
process 
wilson said he has been working with a stamford conn marketing 
firm to launch the vodka his other products include alaska bottled 
water and bagged beverage ice chipped from alaska glaciers 
he said the anchorage vodka plant is a 500000 highspeed 
facility built to produce more than 5 million bottles of vodka 
annually he is offering two sizes with suggested retail prices of 
12 and 16 the bottles bear a label with an eagle and a star and 
carry a pewtercolored seal stamped with the words made in 
alaskaattakiska 
wilson said that by years end he expects to operate with two 
shifts involving a total of 21 full and parttime employees 
the vodka market is huge he said and the percentage of us 
demand met with imported versions of the drink has been increasing 
in recent years 
educated as a zoologist wilson 40 said he got into the 
beverage business after he and a partner mick mckay started a 
business in the field of water treatment 
with much of that enterprise related to the oil industry 
activity for the men dwindled as the oil boom flattened wilson 
said he and mckay had been developing a consumer division in their 
firm wetco inc and those operations carried them through the bad 
times in the petroleum industry he said

neil leclerc clearly is one guy you wouldnt want 
to mess with on the wrestling mat or in the kitchen 
at 24 leclerc has a solid hold on two divergent careers in 
fact when theyre in season many of the wrestlers who train under 
leclerc try to think about anything but food making weight is all 
that matters and the delicacies that come out of leclercs kitchen 
wouldnt help that cause 
they have joked about it leclerc says of the wrestlers he 
coached at troy high school last season they would make comments 
like are you going to make us something to eat after practice 
coach 
as a macho sport wrestling seems to have little in common with 
catering 
but leclerc points to the precision of preparing a special food 
dish and the technique needed to successfully perform a difficult 
wrestling move 
leclercs business called charmont is busier than ever these 
days with wrestling season coming the gas on the stove will be 
turned down as the heat on the mat is turned up 
leclerc is in his first season as head coach at southfield high 
school where the wrestling program has been lackluster in recent 
years 
when athletic director art carinci heard leclerc was a caterer 
he was pleased 
my reaction was that sounds great he could cater our sports 
banquet carinci says 
but carinci says leclerc was hired for his wrestling not his 
culinary credentials after the job was posted among teachers and 
staff carinci interviewed and hired leclerc whose catering 
business is in nearby royal oak mich 
leclerc has been wrestling since kindergarten his kitchen career 
began at 13 when he weighed dough at a pizza parlor owned by a 
family friend then came the sauce later he experimented with 
homemade soups at the maple house restaurant 
leclerc has worked in other restaurants and in 1987 he received 
an associate degree in culinary arts 
it was realizing that i had a talent early leclerc says 
there were certain things i could do that other people in the 
restaurant who were much older and more experienced couldnt do 
while he has plenty of wedding and church business right now 
leclerc is probably two years away from opening his own kitchen 
when that happens he has a new name in mind what dreams are made 
of 
leclerc says he sees his kitchen vocation as helping his coaching 
job 
maybe if i did do the sports banquet and the basketball coach 
liked the food hed give up the gym one or two days a week so the 
wrestling team could use it he says 
leclerc says he knows of no colleagues who cook at all let alone 
to make a living the federal government doesnt either 
we keep track of people who have two jobs but we kind of keep a 
little more in the mainstream says kathryn hoyle a spokeswoman 
for the us bureau of labor statistics

with more than 25000 restaurants within its 
borders new york city might well be considered the culinary 
crossroads of the world 
diners can choose from what the new york convention and visitors 
bureau describes as a cornucopia of international cuisines 
including brazilian cajun chinese french german greek indian 
italian japanese mexican russian spanish thai or vietnamese 
specialties 
but at rockefeller center in the very heart of manhattan 
patrons also might encounter such attractions as breakfast at the 
ok corral lunch selections from the firefighters cookbook 
or a dinner menu built around recipes borrowed from the tasty meals 
served to ringling brothers and barnum amp bailey circus performers 
such offbeat items are most often seen on the menus of the 
american festival cafe one of three restaurants wrapped around the 
famed iceskating rink which becomes an open air garden cafe during 
the warm weather season 
the other two eateries are the elegant sea grill which 
specializes in seafood and savories a casual restaurant geared to 
speedy service and takeout delectables the emphasis at all three is 
on allamerican dining the wine list is strictly domestic and the 
beer choices feature regional american brews 
customers at the american festival when the ok corral 
breakfast was offered in 1986 found such imaginative menu offerings 
as apples baked in bourbon eggs scrambled with frizzled beef jerky 
oatmeal flapjacks with molassesstewed prunes and judge roy beans 
beans 
ruth epstein who has helped plan and promote such 
offthebeatentrack themes since the restaurant opened four years 
ago explains how beans usually were prepared in the judges wild 
west days 
by the time the pale pink beans called arizona strawberries had 
cooked all night in their covering of bourbon onions molasses 
salt pork and spices the bourbons alcohol had entirely evaporated 
leaving behind only the mellow smoky flavor of kentuckys pride as a 
reminder of the previous evenings carouse 
according to miss epstein public relations consultant for 
restaurant associates which operates the three eateries adopting 
new themes and changing menus several times a year is not a simple 
task especially when the restaurant serves about 450000 meals 
annually matching the combined total of 450000 meals served at the 
other two restaurants 
its not the easiest thing in the world to do with a 
restaurant because change as it is for people is difficult for 
restaurants you have to extend yourself to change rather than keep 
on doing the same thing she explains 
changing a menu requires an extraordinary pulling together of a 
very large team everybody has to cooperate when you have a 
changewhen i have an idea sometimes even supplying recipes for 
them the chef is always there because the cooking people are 
involved from the beginning 
theres also the purchasing and marketing departments and the 
liquor buyers and so on then when the new menu is set and tested 
and ready to be printed on paper it involves everybody in the 
restaurant who serves it 
there are meetings by our management staff to teach people who 
serve it what it is how it looks how it tastes how its served 
when firehouse cooking was the theme early last year the 
program was billed as a tribute to americas firehouse chefs all of 
the recipes were created by firefighters and most were taken from 
john sinenos bestselling the firefighters cookbook 
during the testing of the chefs cooking of recipes being 
considered for the menu the firefighters tasting panel discovered 
something new miss epstein recalls 
as she explained in the american festival newsletter 
they pointed out that there must be some mistake in the 
manicotti delicious as it was and please pass some more theirs 
had never had a sauce like that it took our forensic team some time 
to determine that two recipes had inadvertently been combined and 
that danny princes manicotti had been topped with a sauce based on 
his artichoke pie thus are great dishes born 
it was named manicotti with accidental sauce and was the 
first dish to earn a place on the firehouse cooking menu 
the circus theme featured a menu recalling the days when ringling 
brothers and company played under canvas and traveled on a train a 
hundred cars long carrying some 1400 people lions tigers and 
elephants 
the fun menu the cooking of the circus stars was printed in 
red white and blue and borrowed the traditional hyperbole of circus 
promotions it declared the offerings as the most gorgeous and 
princely spectacle of monumental magnificence ever beforked

a lucky 1750 lottery 
winners delight each christmas to the toasts and tastes of the 
annual bracebridge dinner at yosemite national park complete with 
snow if youre even luckier 
the toasts are echoed by the andrea fulton chorale and the 
bracebridge cast from the san francisco area some of them having 
been involved with the dinner for more than 30 years the tastes are 
those of a sumptuous sevencourse dinner in the highceilinged 
logbeamed ahwahnee hotel 
five seatings of 350 revelers each are held yearly two on dec 
22 one on christmas eve and two on christmas day the fourhour 
pageant is set amidst squire bracebridges yorkshire christmas

lord of misrule and in 1929 assumed the role of director four 
years after his death adams spirit still pervades the perioddress 
gathering ironically with a ban on cameras 
once a guest has beaten the greater than 101 odds of being 
chosen in the 100 dinner lottery he or she is advised by letter to 
keep in line with longstanding tradition we insist that all 
bracebridge dinner guests refrain from bringing cameras into the 
dinner room bill wymore general manager of the ahwahnee says 
this policy was established at the request of ansel adams to 
preserve the atmosphere of bracebridge hall 
each course begins with a whimsical prelude when the boars head 
and the baron of the beef are presented to a lavishly dressed squire 
bracebridge played by a stout local actor the baron is knighted 
sir loin the diners seated at large round tables get more into 
the spirit of the evening as the courses progress at the base of an 
altarlike head table the squire and his cast of characters 
including the jester and a dancing bear lead the revelry and are 
presented each course for approval with song 
the dinner billed as semiformal to formal grows more 
effervescent as it progresses from peacock pie crepe of goose with 
juniperberry sauce to boars head roast sirloin of beef to plum 
pudding with hard sauce

supermarket produce counters are taking on a 
special look these days with bean sprouts bok choy guava and 
other exotic items catching the eye of food shoppers says an 
agriculture department economist 
specialty fruit and vegetable displays form a fundamental part 
of the new upscale image of many produce sections says catherine 
greene of the departments economic research service 
rising demand for specialty produce is in line with a general 
increase in fruit and vegetable consumption she says on the 
average americans consumed 427 pounds of fruits and vegetables last 
year up 12 percent since 1972 that is a farm weight equivalent 
before trimming processing and afterharvest losses she says 
greene writing in the agencys national food review said there 
are a number of reasons 
americans have become more health conscious eating lots of 
fruits and vegetables as part of a wellbalanced diet she said 
consequently we want a huge selection of produce 
further americans travel more frequently than they used to and 
many want foreign foods when they return home 
unusual fruits and vegetables are appearing on restaurant 
menus greene said also influencing our diets are recent 
immigrants from the caribbean central america and southeast asia 
who have brought their native foods with them 
a survey conducted for a trade journal the packer showed the 
most frequently tried specialty fresh vegetables were alfalfa and 
bean sprouts followed by snow peas pearl onions parsnips leeks 
baby vegetables chinese cabbage and shallots 
moreover about a third of those surveyed also had seen or heard 
of less widely known specialty vegetables such as belgian endive 
bok choy celeriac daikon kohlrabi parsley root and jerusalem 
artichoke 
the most frequently tried specialty fresh fruits in order were 
pomegranates persimmons kumquats quince and guavas 
additionally at least a third of those surveyed had seen or 
heard of breadfuit passion fruit plantains prickly pear and red 
bananas but some fruits were nearly unkown asian pears

getting over the river and through the woods to 
the family thanksgiving feast via ohare international airport 
always a challenge may be even tougher this year because of new 
federal flight limits 
and things dont look much better for christmas say travel 
agents airline and aviation officials 
were routinely advising our customers and clients of the 
lets say congestion problems at major airports particularly 
ohare said david powell american express travel service vice 
president 
the new federal aviation administration limits on the number of 
flights allowed to arrive at ohare in a given hour are likely to 
aggravate the problem at the nations busiest airport 
following a startling 150 percent increase in the number of 
errors by air traffic controllers at ohare this year the faa in 
october ordered the airport to cut the number of arrivals from 96 
per hour to 80 per hour between peaktravel times of 445 pm and 
915 pm 
while the cutbacks called a flow control program were 
designed to make skies safer airlines acknowledge they also have 
increased tardiness in a system in which delays never were uncommon 
we have seen a definite impact from the flow control program 
said spokesman tom stack of american airlines the secondlargest 
carrier at ohare 
to give some example in october of 1987 at ohare we were 
above 95 percent in our arrivals within 15 minutes that dropped to 
about 75 percent in october of this year 
airlines also no longer have a reserve of planes to help 
accommodate heavy holiday traffic said united airlines spokesman 
joe hopkins 
while the number of flights over the holiday wont be up much 
about 2300 total arrivals and departures per day the number of 
people in the skies will be as airlines see their planes filled to 
capacity 
stack anticipates that sometime over the fourday thanksgiving 
weekend american will top its previous oneday record of more than 
30000 passengers flown out of ohare 
passengers ought to look forward to having some delays both 
in the air and on the ground he said adding that sunday may be 
worst of all people can choose a variety of days to begin 
vacation but pretty much they wind up returning on that sunday 
assuming clear skies the airlines said travelers should find the 
delays manageable but if the weather declines to cooperate 
everything is up for grabs 
sixty percent of your delays are related to weather said faa 
spokesman mort edelstein in chicago 
the new faa limitations were imposed after the number of 
controller errors reached 30 far exceeding the 12 reported at 
ohare in all of 1987 four of the errors occurred over a period of 
a week edelstein said 
even with the new limits theres no perfect flow control 
edelstein said some hours well take 82 arrivals per hour we 
are liberal with the 80 an hour when it has to be 
some feel the cutbacks dont go far enough 
the airlines schedule so many fights at certain times in and 
out that the airport cant handle them said david shuler a 
controller at ohare and a representative of the national air 
traffic control association theres only so many taxiways the 
aircraft can be on 
shuler said the longterm solution is 30 more controllers at 
ohare 
the shortterm answer for travelers 
avoid key peak times and dont put off travel plans till the 
last minute said powell of american express

severe economic problems 
aggravated by the costs of apartheid are causing a spread of hunger 
disease and unemployment in south africa a prominent research 
organization reports 
the south african institute of race relations an independent 
group with a reputation for impartial research said in its annual 
survey on sunday that the effects of economic decline pervade the 
picture of south african society 
housing experts estimate that 7 million of the nations 26 
million blacks live in shacks the report said 
it quoted the national tuberculosis association as reporting that 
the disease although preventable was killing 10 people a day 
the institute cited a university study forecasting that south 
africa could have a surplus of 9 million unskilled workers without 
jobs by the year 2000 unless the economy is revitalized 
unemployment estimates among blacks range from 20 percent to 50 
percent though reliable figures are not available 
economic problems continue to be exacerbated by expenditure on 
segregated structures and by the governments failure to meet black 
political demands the report said 
it referred to a recent speech by president pw botha in which 
he said the governments plans to eliminate inequalities in social 
services were being disrupted by foreign sanctions and embargoes in 
protest of apartheid under which the black majority has no voice in 
national affairs 
botha said the campaign of economic war being waged against 
us could deprive the government of 400 million for social 
programs over the next five years and delay their implementation by 
10 to 15 years 
the race relations institute cited estimates that the government 
wasted 400 million each year operating racially segregated health 
services 
government health officials reported widespread malnutrition 
problems and operation hunger a private group said it was feeding 
12 million south africans a day according to the institutes 
report 
the report said economic problems had sidetracked a longstanding 
government promise to equalize perpupil spending at black and white 
schools this initiative has been stalled because the countrys 
annual economic growth rate is now 25 percent instead of the 
projected 41 percent rate on which the plan was based the report 
said 
of government spending on education 41 percent went to white 
schools although only 11 percent of the students were white the 
report said it said the government acknowledged that white school 
facilities were underutilized but was reluctant to let them be used 
to alleviate serious overcrowding in black schools 
the government says it is committed to tax reform deregulation 
privatization and social improvements for blacks but it is not 
willing to remove the budgetary duplication created by segregated 
schools and hospitals and by the countrys 13 separate 
administrations divided into white mixedrace asian and 10 black 
homelands 
south africans also are feeling the harsh effects of economic 
measures taken by the government to counter the 133 percent annual 
inflation 
the measures include higher tariffs for imported luxury goods 
in addition the country faces a foreign debt that is expected to 
reach almost 12 billion in 199091 and is equivalent to about half 
its export earnings 
in another development sunday newspapers reported that the three

the older television grows the more juvenile it 
becomes 
delirious in a factbased fever tv sets are boiling over with 
playground pranks and true detective docudramas from geraldo 
riveras scuffle with wannabe nazis to the slowmo misdeeds on 
americas most wanted television has rarely been so revolting 
and so riveting at the same time 
the new splurge of reality programming has critics shaking their 
heads and viewers crowding living room sofas and as long as the 
ratings soar a whole lot more truthisstrangerthanfiction series 
will be hurtling your way 
which is why reality champion fox broadcasting co is riding high 
i do think were on to something said barry diller foxs 
chairman and chief executive officer the reporters is not a 
carbon copy of anything else and i think americas most 
wanted is an honestly moving show 
in fact these shows owe a lot to previous programs the 
reporters can be seen as merely 60 minutes on a caffeine jag 
the crime shows as simply borrowing from the headlines more directly 
than did hill street blues or st elsewhere 
imitators are lining up nbc has added unsolved mysteries to 
its schedule cbs started high risk and abc has resurrected 
thats incredible and added the trilogy of scandals 
crimes of the century and trackdown 
meanwhile television syndicators are pounding the pavement for 
on trial group one medical tabloid exclusive 
crimewatch tonight crime diaries reward and inside 
edition 
the popularity springs from a cast of characters more varied and 
bizarre than any sitcom 
in one corner are the hyperactive talkshow hosts rivera with 
his broken nose and the clusterbomb of phil donahue oprah winfrey 
and sally jessy raphael with all of their needling queries these 
four ask the questions we only dream about posing 
the other corner is filled with the marginally less egotistical 
journalists who would recreate the john kennedy assassination if 
there were a rating point in it 
led by maury povich on foxs syndicated a current affair and 
its rape and murder replay show americas most wanted the key 
here is to sit the audience down next to the corpse smack in the 
middle of the crime scene 
wherever reality programs fail in subtlety and substance they 
click in thrills and ratings costing a fraction of traditional 
comedies and dramas these unpredictable programs have in some 
instances doubled foxs audience share 15 percent of the nations 
sets tune in americas most wanted 
overall the audience is clearly substantial rivera nose broken 
but selfimportance intact is soaring from publicity generated from 
his talkshow brawl and his nbc hit devil worship exposing 
satans underground 
rivera the carnival barker of television journalism even went 
so far as to slap a promotional teaser on the slugfest edition of 
geraldo parents be advised that the language and violence 
contained makes this show inappropriate for small children in 
other words kids watch this 
why are audiences lapping it up 
american television viewers are tired of watching the most 
inoffensive programming said kevin wendle executive vice 
president of foxs entertainment division they have said we 
dont want another network give us something different and were 
pulling out all the stops 
and how mixing sometimes sensational celebrity gossip and lurid 
crime stories with firstperson journalism the reporters 
doesnt just penetrate the fourth wall it runs through it into 
your home 
future fox shows may be even more personal among ideas in the 
hopper for foxs third night of programming planned for mondays 
sometime next year is cops a graphic documentary series about 
a group of florida police officers making arrests and handling dead 
bodies 
another fox program in development will try to build on detective 
magazines with private eyes talking up their most interesting cases 
with the help of video recreations 
they fox have shown that theres an insatiable thirst for 
real life among the television viewing audience said rivera 
they are filling a void that the networks are leaving i think 
that americas most wanted has really hit a nerve its populist 
tv at its most pragmatic 
so much flotsam clogs the reality genre that some players are now 
trying to rise above it all 
nick clooney host of the courtroom highlight show on trial 
recently sent reporters a letter saying by some unimaginable 
stretch of probabilities a few writers equate such programs as 
geraldo and morton downey jr with on trial nothing could be 
further from the truth the letter was mailed one day after an 
on trial publicist asked that the show be included in any 
upcoming stories on tabloid television 
as with most anything else too much of a good thing can be 
risky if the realitybased programming crumples overnight so too 
might fox 
while its great now well be careful diller said if 
were not very careful about the diet well make terrible 
mistakes

saudi arabia is seeking more 
involvement in refining and marketing oil products as a buffer 
against swings in crude oil prices according to oil minister hisham 
nazer 
in an interview on staterun television nazer said the saudi oil 
industry wants to compete in united states european and japanese 
markets through joint ventures with foreign oil concerns 
analysts have said other opec countries also are looking for 
similar downstream ventures to help offset the 
countercyclicality of production and refining falling crude prices 
have been a boon to many us refiners while hurting production 
operations 
the saudi arabian national oil company which runs the kingdoms 
oil industry recently launched a joint venture with texaco inc to 
refine and market petroleum in the united states 
the american market is big and there is still more to it while 
there is the very big market in japan and europe and far east and 
we as processors of oil must storm these markets and guarantee 
marketing outlets for saudi crude oil nazer said in the 
interview broadcast sunday 
nazer also mentioned plans for similar deals in european and 
japanese markets noting that prices of refined products remain 
steady despite fluctuating crude prices 
in case the price of crude oil drops the income would be 
compensated somewhat through preserving the price levels of refined 
products he said 
declining oil prices since 1982 have meant six straight years of 
budget deficits in saudi arabia the biggest producer among the 13 
organization of petroleum exporting countries saudi arabia has the 
worlds largest oil reserves 
the current world oil glut has forced prices down to about 13 a 
barrel well below the opec benchmark price of 18 
nazer said the kingdoms oil development strategy would be 
lacking if it did not comprise all stages of the industry starting 
from the wellhead and ending with the gasoline station 
the texaco deal gave the kingdom a 50 percent stake in three 
texaco refineries and nearly 12000 service stations in the united 
states it was the first major saudi attempt to guarantee outlets 
for its crude oil 
nazer said in the television interview that the deal guaranteed 
sales of 600000 barrels per day saudi arabias current opec 
production quota is 434 million barrels per day 
revamping the saudi oil industry also includes measures to 
improve profits at the staterun refining and marketing company 
petrofin nazer said petrofin controls all but one of the kingdoms 
six oil refineries operates three lubricants plants and distributes 
and exports refined products 
petrofin also controls exploration and development of nonoil 
mineral resources such as bauxite the raw material for aluminum 
and gold 
the aim is to convert all of petrofins tasks to profit centers 
that bring additional revenue to the state and then to reduce the 
expenditure costs in petromin nazer said he said savings of 500 
million riyals 133 million already have been made

winstonsalem nc ap despite a third straight year of 
drought officials say the burley tobacco going to market today will 
be larger and higher in quality than last years crop 
the market opens this week in north carolina and seven other 
states and marketing officials are cautiously predicting that 
farmers will have a better selling season this year than last year 
i think the price average will be up but that will mainly be 
because of the higher quality said joey coleman who operates the 
two tobacco warehouses in boone with his father 
last year north carolina burley prices averaged 15087 per 
hundred pounds down from the previous seasons average of 15601 
this seasons federal price support average will be 150 a 
pound up by slightly more than 1 cent by grades the support will 
range from 98 cents to 163 the same as last season 
its looking a lot better than it did in july before the rains 
came said ed french of the federalstate market news service in 
lexington ky 
a larger crop is expected this year because of more planted 
acreage and slightly higher yields he said 
the nov 1 crop survey estimates the crop at 5389 million pounds 
for the eightstate burley belt up from last years 4866 million 
pounds yields are projected at 2043 pounds an acre up from 1943 
pounds last year 
north carolinas burley crop is expected to total 153 million 
pounds up from 141 million last year yields are projected at 
1800 pounds an acre slightly more than last years 1785 pounds 
kentucky produces more than half the total crop burley tobacco 
is also grown in virginia tennessee west virginia indiana ohio 
and missouri 
french said it would be difficult to estimate whether demand for 
the burley crop would be as strong as for this years fluecured 
tobacco crop 
everyone seems to be optimistic he said but he added such 
optimism can fade quickly if farmers are disappointed with prices on 
opening day 
mary jo hicks who is operating both tobacco warehouses in west 
jefferson this season said she is encouraged by the favorable 
comments from government graders and a couple of buyers who watched 
farmers bring in tobacco last week 
they are looking at it as a very desirable crop she said 
in north carolina sales will open today at markets in west 
jefferson and asheville with the boone market beginning sales

a lawyers association has asked colorado insurance 
commissioner john kezer to put a stop to an aetna life amp casulty 
advertising campaign on lawsuit abuse contending that it misleads 
the public 
the colorado trial lawyers association a trade group for lawyers 
who handle personal injury lawsuits contends that many of the 
problems mentioned in aetnas ads were resolved through the states 
1986 tort reform law which sets limits on damages in personal 
injury lawsuits 
kezer said he is still weighing the issue of misrepresentation 
versus aetnas first amendment right to speak out on issues its 
not just black and white he said 
aetnas campaign ongoing in denver st louis rochester ny 
and new orleans highlights what the connecticutbased company 
claims is a growing abuse of the nations court system by people 
trying to make money via lawsuits 
the ads complain that abusive lawsuits are costing insurance 
companies too much money and that the public is paying for it 
through higher insurance rates they ask concerned parties to call a 
tollfree number 
lance sears president of the lawyers association said the 1986 
colorado law made important changes aimed at ending frivolous suits 
and other abuses in the states civil justice system 
bob caruthers aetnas director of corporate communications said 
the company wants to make people as aware of lawsuit abuse as they 
are of littering and drunken driving 
he said the ad campaign is different from the sort of campaign 
waged in 1986 when the states tort reform was passed at that time 
he said aetna was trying to reach business leaders and elected 
officials 
now he said the company is taking its case to the people 
in some cases tort reform and other civil statutes are being 
challenged which is one reason for the campaign he said 
the company is planning to expand the 800000 test market to a 
nationwide newspaperandradio advertising campaign

the number of working oil and gas rigs jumped by 
26 this week to 923 rebounding from a sharp plunge in the previous 
week industry watcher baker hughes inc reported 
the increase continues to reflect an unstable trend in the rig 
count which last week dropped by 45 to total 897 
a year ago the count was 1152 baker hughes said monday 
the count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activity 
and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of 
last friday not the number of rigs actively producing oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the number of working rigs since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 per 
42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in the 
rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes began 
compiling figures 
the lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on may 2 
among major oil producing states louisiana posted the biggest 
gain with 16 additional rigs followed by oklahoma 10 north 
dakota two and california colorado and ohio one each 
michigan had the biggest decline with 3 fewer rigs followed by 
kansas new mexico pennsylvania and wyoming with two each texas 
was unchanged for the week

the nations economy will grow for the 
seventh straight year in 1989 despite a federal budget deficit that 
will swell to 170 billion according to a bank of america study 
released on monday 
the banks 1989 us economic outlook said there will be no 
recession even though economic growth will slow to 27 percent from 
1988s 38 percent 
the annual growth rate however masks weaknesses in the 
economy which will become evident in the last half of 1989 said 
john wilson the banks chief economist 
after a strong growth rate in the first quarter the result of 
bouncing back from the 1988 drought economic growth will slow to 
under 2 percent for the remainder of the year the study said 
the most serious economic policy challenge that the bush 
administration will face is the federal budget deficit even though 
both the politicians and the general public are suffering from 
battle fatigue on this issue said wilson 
inflation will increase to 49 percent from 41 percent in 1988 
while the unemployment rate will be around 55 percent next year 
wage gains are expected to increase an average of 43 percent 
compared to 33 percent the forecast said as a result consumer 
prices will be 07 of a percentage point higher in 1989 due to wage 
pressures

presidentelect george bush insisted today that 
im not going to change my view on how to keep the deficit down 
despite a congressional report saying his proposed flexible 
freeze on spending wont solve the problem of the federal 
governments burgeoning red ink 
im under no illusions about the simplicity of all of this im 
determined to get that budget deficit down but i cant get 
discouraged every time somebody comes out with yet another report 
bush said at a news conference announcing three personnel 
appointments including that of richard darman a former white house 
aide and deputy treasury secretary as budget director 
a report over the weekend by the general accounting office the 
investigative arm of congress concluded that a spending freeze 
alone would not fix the deficit which stood at 150 billion in the 
budget year that ended sept 30 
the report said that tax increases and cuts in defense and social 
security must be considered to slash the budget deficit and for the 
new administration to have any flexibility to pursue its own 
policy agenda and for the economy to regain its vigor 
specifically the report said the united states cannot 
freeze our way out of the problem during his presidential 
campaign bush repeateldy rejected higher taxes and advocted a 
flexible freeze on spending 
rep bill gray dpa chairman of the house budget committee 
said earlier today on cbs this morning that bush will probably 
have to reassess his economic assumptions once he gets into office 
and will submit his own budget which will reflect the new 
realities 
bush said today he would indeed sit down with my budget 
director and go into exactly where we stand on all these numbers 
but he added i dont think theres been any dramatic change in 
the figures weve been dealing with the gao seems to come out with 
reports periodically but i will be persuaded much more by what my 
budget director tells me is the reality than by their reports 
im open minded in terms of hearing from all these people 
but im not going to change my view as to how we get this deficit 
down bush said i spelled out a program that was endorsed 
by the american people i dont remember any republicans or 
democrats running on a pleaseraisemytaxes program he said 
gray who is leaving the budget committee chairmanship in the new 
congress said the democratic leadership will support bush if he 
comes up with a plan to meet his stated priorities of reducing the 
deficit without new taxes while preserving national defense and 
important programs like social security education clean air and 
the antidrug effrt 
the question is making sure we have the right numbers and the 
right kind of assumptions gray said

negotiations between the chicago suntimes and its 
unionized editorial employees resumed this morning hours before a 
threatened walkout by the writers editors photographers and 
support staff 
a strike deadline of 230 pm cst today was set by the 
negotiating committee of chicago newspaper guild local 71 though 
the deadline could be changed said daniel lehman the newspapers 
religion writer and a union spokesman 
talks resumed at 9 am said suntimes spokesman michael soll 
but he added that at this time it looks like 230 would be as 
far as we can go 
soll said newspaper negotiators were willing to meet around the 
clock and that he hoped the talks would be fruitful 
there appears to be much less anguish and much more hope 
among negotiators on both sides he said salary remained the main 
sticking point 
the suntimes negotiators have not yet made their final 
offer soll said adding he expected that offer to be made at 
todays meeting 
union leaders met late sunday night and agreed to accept the 
company proposal for a bargaining session today 
well keep negotiating until we have a settlement or until we 
hit the strike deadline and then were out of there said shane 
gericke a copy editor and member of the negotiating committee for 
the union which represents 250 reporters editors photographers 
and support staff 
we decided to give it every shot he said 
a strike by suntimes editorial workers would be the first in the 
newspapers 40year history 
soll said management did not want a strike but is fully 
prepared to produce a paper using company executives nonunion 
editors and outside writers 
he said the newspaper would continue putting out its three daily 
editions 
union members have been working without a contract since june 1 
as the strike deadline approached guild unit chairman thomas 
gibbons said the union would walk out if the company continued to 
refuse to offer a pay raise 
the guild has been seeking a 195 percent pay raise over three 
years while managements latest proposal was for a 3 percent salary 
cut for 18 months followed by a restoration of current pay levels 
for the remainder of the threeyear pact gibbons said 
weve got to have pay raises in the contract for this to be 
settled he said 
in addition gibbons said differences remained over management 
proposals to cut night differential for workers by 40 percent and 
exempt eight senior editorial staffers from union jurisdiction 
soll said the paper is healthy financially but must control 
its costs to remain competitive with the larger chicago tribune 
which has an estimated circulation of 765000 daily and 1117 
million sunday 
the suntimes whose circulation is estimated at 605000 daily 
and 614000 on sunday was purchased from australian media baron 
rupert murdoch for 145 million in june 1986 by a group of investors 
led by the new york investment firm adler amp shaykin

more than a dozen years after communist 
victories in indochina thailand is hoping to turn its adversaries 
next door into trading partners and battlefields into lucrative 
marketplaces 
calling for increased commerce with vietnam laos and cambodia 
thai businessmen see potential in markets shunned by their hardline 
government 
as vietnam liberalizes its underdeveloped economy thai 
businessmen and some legislators worry that if they act too slowly 
others will corner a market thailand is in a favorable geographic 
position to penetrate 
japan and singapore already ply those markets each drawing about 
300 million a year in a low profile but brisk trade among other 
competitors in the region are hong kong taiwan and france 
prime minister chatichai choonhavan himself a businessman 
started talking about improving general relations with indochina as 
well as exploring economic opportunities shortly after taking office 
last august battlefields into marketplaces has become one of 
the slogans of the new government 
thai businessmen are angling for fishing licenses in rich 
vietnamese waters and sending agricultural experts to laos to 
supervise an experimental farm while importing timber from that 
country 
laotians shop at a thairun department store in the heart of the 
capital of vientiane and a thai company recently entered into the 
first major joint venture investment project in laos the 
construction of a garment factory 
but officially thailand has thus far had no 
governmenttogovernment economic transactions with vietnam since 
hanois troops invaded neighboring cambodia and thai policy has 
been one of putting pressure on hanoi in all fields 
the thai government also offers no help to private entrepreneurs 
doing business with indochina but generally turns a blind eye to 
the vast black market trade across its borders with cambodia and 
laos as well as burma 
we have lost time and lost out to countries that actively 
traded with indochina regardless of their governments strong 
opposition to vietnamese troops in cambodia said wongse 
polnikorn a onetime deputy foreign minister and currently chairman 
of a thai company that will import timber from laos and set up a 
cash crop farm in vientiane 
chatichai decreed that the number of goods officially banned for 
export to laos be halved to 30 in advance of his recent visit to 
laos the first by a thai prime minister since 1979 government 
spokesman suvit yodmani said 
since the 1975 communist victory periodic skirmishes as well 
as two major confrontations have erupted along the thailaotian 
border similar clashes have occurred between thais and vietnamese 
along the thaicambodian frontier 
last year twoway trade between laos and thailand topped 48 
million although the black market or unofficial trade is known 
to be far higher twoway trade with vietnam rose to 75 million 
last year from 48 million in 1986 while thai exports to cambodia 
were 400000 in 1986 
suvit said chatichais moves toward vietnam were a trial 
balloon to induce hanoi to focus on improving its economy rather 
than making war 
but some in thailand which has traditionally been suspicious of 
hanois longterm intentions in the region view a prosperous 
vietnam as potentially dangerous and expansionist 
if we can make vietnam prosperous ourselves prosperous thats 
great but what is there to guarantee that vietnam wont move into 
thailands northeast suvit said in an interview once its 
prosperous then it can afford to keep troops in cambodia 
surin pitsuwan a respected member of parliament said thailand 
should at first proceed cautiously in trade with laos a country 
with which it shares ethnic and cultural bonds and which poses no 
major security threat he also suggested more economic dealings with 
burma with which official twoway trade totaled 544 million in 
1987 
there are a lot of trade opportunities and untapped resources 
next door surin said if we dont hurry now the degree of 
their dependence on us will be reduced 
although thailand will be hard pressed to compete with japanese 
technology and funding involved in major projects businessmen say 
the thais could carve out a profitable indochina niche in areas like 
fishing forestry and smallerscale construction 
thailand with its economy booming and consumer spending on an 
upward curve could also serve as a market for indochinese goods 
while war and mismanagement have eroded the economic infrastructure 
in indochina the three countries possess large untapped natural 
resources and an abundance of cheap labor 
we must go and explore ways we can do more and benefit from one 
another said kangwan tantiponganant a businessmen involved in 
laos 
given the political sensitivities other thai businessmen prefer 
to make lowkeyed trips to hanoi and vientiane emphasizing that 
their interests are in longterm business planning

need a cheap ticket to rio 
are you willing to dress well for the trip shun alcohol on the 
flight and do a little light delivery work 
if so you may be ready for a fastpaced career as an overseas 
air courier 
for up to 70 percent off the cost of a regular airline ticket 
couriers shuttle business documents and small parcels from the 
united states to foreign lands and back its all perfectly legal 
for example flying to rio de janiero on a commercial flight from 
boston costs over 1000 depending on the season but now voyager 
a new york air courier booking agent had an election day flight for 
150 roundtrip from new york the roundtrip cost of a shuttle 
flight to new york from boston would add 198 
being a courier is very simple said air courier guru kenneth 
clarke who has taken about 20 international flights as a courier 
and writes a monthly newsletter on the subject you dont have to 
do anything you just have to be there 
clarke 36 an australian who has lived in new york city for 13 
years said he was working as a ground courier four years ago when 
somebody told me it was possible to fly back on the concorde for 
250 bucks two weeks later i was in london and i did it 
about 20 courier companies most based in new york and los 
angeles are battling in what has developed in the last five years 
into a highly competitive business 
when this industry started if you could offer threeday service 
companies just about knelt down and kissed your feet said toni 
carpenter overseas director of ibc pacific a los angeles 
courier company next year im expecting them to demand yesterday 
service 
couriering began in the mid1970s but the need for speedy 
international business deliveries to new york london hong kong 
milan or paris didnt surge until the beginning of this decade many 
companies in the past either hired private couriers or sent their 
own employees more expensive and timeconsuming than using 
civilian couriers who pay to fly rather than getting paid 
getting things on someones desk by 10 oclock tomorrow morning 
became very important in business said michelle rosen of now 
voyager in new york if you ship something by freight it can take 
as long as 72 hours to clear customs and is consigned to a freight 
terminal 
banks stock brokerage houses insurance companies film studios 
all use air couriers regularly typically shipping bundles of 
documents and bulky materials under a signed contract couriers 
arent responsible for the contents of their packages and typically 
dont even touch them 
couriers normally pay a fee to a service now voyager charges 
45 and then say when and where they want to travel booking up to 
three months in advance for regular scheduled departures and return 
trips on commercial airlines 
payment is the bargain ticket usually 30 percent to 70 percent 
off regular fares 
couriers travel to the airport with the courier company which 
checks the baggage and hands over the baggage claim receipts and on 
international flights a manifest listing contents 
the courier meets another agent at the destination and either 
hands over the receipts or brings the material packed in canvas 
bags bearing the courier company logo through customs and is free 
to go until the return also usually a courier trip 
so whats the catch 
couriers are permitted only a carryon bag drinking alcohol is 
not permitted on board and couriers have to dress well and they 
have to be flexible in terms of booking most couriers are 
freelance whatevers selfemployed retired teachers or 
students but its not impossible to schedule vacations around 
courier flights 
some companies are wholesalers meaning they ship freight on 
contract from other couriers usually to points not served by those 
couriers for instance federal express may hire another courier to 
get a package to an overseas point 
most courier trips made by civilians are international some 85 
percent on now voyager because major domestic courier companies 
provide their own overnight service within the united states 
clarkes october newsletter listed about 100 available flights 
from new york chicago los angeles san francisco and miami 
including a 499 roundtrip ticke to hong kong and 75 roundtrip to 
bermuda roundtrip european destinations come as cheap as 150 to 
amsterdam 
clarke started an air courier company that folded and now 
lectures on being a courier at adult education schools like 
bostons learning adventure which offers classes on cooking 
hanggliding and how to find a lover 
for all adventurous readers now voyager has just introduced 
guatemala as a destination clarke writes in his typewritten 
travel secrets in which he lists available courier flights by 
company and even proffers vacation tips 
at 250 roundtrip its a bargain and seven days is enough 
time to take a side trip to the spectacular mayan ruins at tikal

down and 461 unchanged

but analysts said many investors remained skeptical that the 
dollar would be able to continue strengthening on its own indeed 
it fell today against leading foreign currencies

rjr nabisco incs stock surged in heavy trading 
today after directors extended the recordsized auction for the 
company and disclosed they had received one tentative offer possibly 
more than 26 billion 
the staggering takeover maneuvers for the foodandtobacco giant 
grew even more complex sunday when a special committee of directors 
evaluating offers said it was postponing the deadline for bidders 
until nov 29 
the committee also disclosed that the bids received as of the 
first deadline last friday not only topped all previous bids which 
were in the unprecedented 90ashare or 20 billion range but that 
all were worth at least 94 a share or about 213 billion the 
committee said one group had estimated its offer as possibly worth 
up to 118 a share or 266 billion 
it further stated all previous bidders could resubmit offers 
strongly suggesting the committee wasnt satisfied with proposals 
received so far the committee also told its own advisers to 
consider other types of restructuring 
while no assurance can be given that any transaction will 
occur the special committee expressed its belief that that process 
which it is overseeing will benefit all shareholders stated 
charles hugel rjr nabiscos chairman and the head of the 
fivemember special committee 
rjrs stock jumped 237 to 8637 on the new york stock 
exchange where it was the most heavily traded stock of the morning 
with more than 144 million shares changing owners 
jostling for approval now are these proposals 
a 100ashare cash and securities offer valued at about 225 
billion from a group led by rjr nabisco senior management and the 
investment firms shearson lehman hutton inc and salomon brothers 
inc that group which last month touched off the buyout battle with 
a proposed takeover previously offered 92 a share or about 207 
billion for rjrs 2253 million common shares outstanding 
a 94ashare cash and securities offer with an indicated value 
of about 212 billion by a group led by buyout specialist kohlberg 
kravis roberts amp co which previously offered 90 a share or about 
203 billion 
a preliminary cash and securities proposal to sell rjrs food 
businesses and later acquire its tobacco business separately from a 
group led by the investment firm first boston corp and a 
partnership that includes chicagos pritzker family and denver 
billionaire philip anschutz first boston indicated it valued the 
total consideration at from 105 to 118 a share 
all three proposals would include a minority equity stake in the 
postbuyout company for current rjr shareholders 
due to the varying potential values and nature of the 
consideration offered in the two bids and the proposal and the 
varying terms conditions and contingencies associated with each 
the special committee determined not to make any recommendation at 
this time hugel stated 
atlantabased rjr makes hundreds of consumer items ranging from 
jose cuervo tequila and salem cigarettes to life savers candy and 
milk bone dog snacks 
any of the latest proposals easily would be the biggest us 
merger ever topping the record 134 billion acquisition of gulf 
oil corp by what is now chevron corp in 1984 
it was not immediately clear whether the bidders were ready to 
escalate the already tense takeover fight 
kohlberg kravis stated its group must carefully consider our 
alternatives in light of new information we will be receiving before 
reaching any judgment on what further steps if any we might take 
f ross johnson rjrs chief executive and the leader of the 
management group said he believed his group had submitted a 
winning bid but gave no indication whether its proposal was 
subject to revision 
there was no comment from the first bostonled group 
the management group offered 100 a share in cash for for 175 
million of the companys 2253 million outstanding common shares 
the group said it would acquire the remaining shares for 56 cash 
plus securities and common stock in the surviving company that it 
said would bring the total consideration to 100 a share the common 
stock would equal about 15 percent of the surviving companys 
outstanding shares 
the new kohlberg kravis proposal would pay 94 cash a share for 
about 178 million rjr nabisco shares the remaining stock would be 
exchanged for preferred stock and securities the firm valued at 94 
a share including convertible debentures that assuming full 
conversion into stock would amount to about 25 percent of the 
postbuyout companys outstanding shares 
the kohlberg and management groups offers are for a leveraged 
buyout in which most of the money for the purchase of rjr nabisco 
would be borrowed and later repaid with the comapnys cash flow or 
the sale of its assets 
the first boston groups preliminary proposal includes the 
installment sale by dec 31 of rjrs food businesses which 
accounted for about 60 percent of net sales last year or 158 
billion followed by the acquisition next year of the tobacco 
operations 
the plan anticipates a purchase of the rjr tobacco business for 
1575 billion plus the stock warrants and the sale of the food 
businesses for a 13 billion installment note plus the right to 80 
percent of the total net proceeds from the sale of food businesses 
that exceeded the amount of the note 
proceeds from the sale of the food operations which analysts 
have estimated could total 125 billion to 155 billion would go 
to shareholders first boston indicated the total consideration 
could range from 98 to 110 cash a share plus securities and stock 
warrants firm valued at from 7 to 8 a share the warrants would 
entitle rjr shareholders to acquire up to 20 percent of the tobacco 
business

sundstrand corp has warned its 
shareholders to brace for almost 40 million more in fines on top 
of 127 million the company is already paying for defrauding the 
government on military contracts 
the government is continuing to pursue claims of approximately 
392 million of misallocated costs plus interest sundstrand said 
in a recent thirdquarter report to shareholders 
the rockfordbased company is awaiting determination letters 
on other government contract disputes besides those related to the 
392 million the company said those letters are the governments 
formal notification that the contractor owes it money 
us attorney anton valukas said today that the additional fines 
mentioned in sundstrands thirdquarter report apparently involve 
civil issues that were not resolved by settlement of criminal 
charges and that we did not believe at the time warranted criminal 
prosecution 
valukas said the government and the company were negotiating a 
settlement of those issues he would not comment further 
the 392 million is nearly twice the 20 million sundstrand has 
left in its special account to resolve disputes involving military 
and other government contracts 
company spokesman claude vernam said friday he knows of no plans 
to put more money into the fund 
however investment analysts said the company probably would have 
to take an additional charge on earnings if sundstrand has to repay 
the entire amount 
it sure seems like it said mitch quain an analyst with 
wertheim schroder in new york 
steve colbert an analyst with prudentialbache research said 
they have on the table less than 20 million the government wants 
40 million plus theres no telling right now what its going to 
be 
sundstrand has pleaded guilty in rockford to four counts of 
criminal fraud it also pleaded guilty in seattle to mischarging on 
government contracts the company was fined 115 million for the 
illinois crimes and 123 million for activities of its sundstrand 
data control operation in seattle 
the fines were the largest ever paid for government contract 
fraud 
a federal grand jury is continuing to look into possible criminal 
charges against company employees

considering how tight your local banker seems to 
be when you approach him for a loan there is a bit of a mystery why 
so many billions of dollars in loans have gone astray 
a few items underscore the mystery of how so many experts in 
finance could have made so many financial blunders on large loans 
while riding herd on tiny ones 
consider these developments in the banking arena 
some of the countrys most prestigious banks are in the process 
of writing down hundreds of millions of dollars in loans to less 
developed nations that may never be repaid 
some banks already have collapsed during 1987 more than 200 
insured banks were closed or kept open only with emergency aid at a 
cost to the federal desposit insurance corp of about 21 billion 
that figure may not depict the true situation at the end of 1987 
close to 1600 insured banks were on the problem list nearly four 
times the number at the end of 1982 when the economy was emerging 
into a long expansion 
the world bank recently won congressional approval of a 14 
billion authorization the better to make loans to less developed 
nations that are unable to handle their existing loans to commercial 
banks 
the cost of restructuring the savings and loan industrys 
finances ruined by bad loans could eventually cost taxpayers 
between 20 billion and 100 billion since the taxpayers are the 
insurers of such loans 
the presidents commission on privatization reported earlier 
this year that the delinquency rate on federal loans was 8 percent 
or three times that on private loans it said the delinquency 
amounts to 24 billion 
in just one area the guaranteed student loan program the 
commission estimated that defaults will reach about 12 billion by 
1990 there is broad agreement that federal lending agencies have 
been ineffective as loan managers the panel said 
it could have been said also about private sector lenders 
the status of loans public and private strains credibility 
and things are not improving the latest craze is for lenders to 
toss billions of dollars at corporate raiders of some of americas 
biggest companies 
is the new debt secure have the loan officers scrutinized the 
applicants are they exercizing their obligations to protect the 
depositors whose money it is if they lose the money will it be 
necessary for uncle sam to rescue them 
somehow critics are saying a sense of responsibility and 
accountability seems to have been lost too often they say the 
costs of the bad loans are borne by the public in taxes rather 
than by the culprits in their wallets 
why this should be so is debatable but federal insurance 
programs may have something to do with it the ability to juggle the 
books that is maintain as an asset a loan everyone knows will not 
be collected may be another reason 
but no answer whatever is likely to satisfy the small borrower 
with an unblemished credit record who has to mortgage the house in 
order to get a loan to repair the roof to him and others the 
mystery cannot be penetrated

the european economic communitys competition 
commissioner said monday it was essential that the 12 eec states 
forge a joint merger control policy 
national laws are simply not adequate to deal with crossborder 
mergers in particular those which may have an effect upon the 
community as a whole commissioner peter sutherland said in a 
speech 
last week eec states agreed to empower the eec commission to 
consider corporate mergers in advance and maybe block them 
but the commission is seeking the power to rule on mergers 
exceeding a billion european currency units which are worth about 
119 billion in annual revenue britain france and west germany 
want that limit raised 
urging speedy adoption of a merger control policy sutherland 
said differing national rules on mergers which may lead to 
conflicting decisions 
this is a severe handicap for the companies concerned who are 
entitled to expect greater legal certainty and more rapid 
procedures he said 
he said companies increasingly view the eec countries as their 
home market it is now widely acknowledged that if the economic 
objectives underpinning the single market strategy are to be 
achieved a streamlined community merger control mechanism must be 
available 
sutherland spoke at a conference organized by the london daily 
financial times on eecs plans to knock down trade barriers among 
its member nations by dec 31 1992 
he said while the eec members adopted a modest airline 
deregulation plan in 1987 we have to go further he said the 
commission has begun drafting proposals for a second stage of 
liberalization 
these will deal with ending curbs on capacity and prices and 
freeing air carriers of the system of slot allocation at airports 
that now favors major airlines at the expense of smaller 
competitors sutherland said 
he said the commission also planned to tackle air transportation 
agreements between eec nations and other countries 
there is now a good case for the negotiation of air service 
agreements between the community and other nations the present 
network of bilateral agreements has resulted in an unduly rigid 
international air transport system he said

in some areas of the country the people who 
process your federal tax return are paid less than those who make 
your hamburgers congressional auditors said monday 
the problem of low salaries was one of several cited by the 
general accounting office in a report on how the irs might improve 
the taxcollection process the report was one of a series by gao 
an arm of congress on major problems to be faced by the new 
president and new congress 
if these issues are not addressed gao boss charles a 
bowsher wrote the irs commissioner can expect 1 serious 
problems in processing tax returns 2 a decline in taxpayer 
confidence in the tax system and 3 a significant loss in tax 
revenues that could help reduce the deficit 
the most pressing irs need is modernization of the taxprocessing 
system gao said noting the agency already has approved a basic 
plan that will cost several billion dollars and is expected to take 
10 years to complete 
irs cannot afford to wait until the mid1990s for a solution to 
an impending computer capacity problem gao said if it does 
the processing problems encountered in 1985 in processing tax 
returns and issuing refunds could reoccur 
most recommendations in the report had been made previously by 
the gao they include 
creating an agencywide plan aimed at improving irs employees 
ability to work effectively in an increasingly automated 
environment low pay is a major problem 
in some geographic areas returns processing staff in the 
service centers are paid less than employees of local fastfood 
restaurants the report said irs faces the same dilemma in 
trying to recruit revenue agents 
it said that while the irs cannot match the big salaries offered 
by some private employers irs could improve its competitive 
position through more modern and sophisticated recruiting 
better employee training a 1987 survey found that 57 percent of 
irs employees believed their training was inadequate half of a 
sample of letters sent to taxpayers were incorrect or unclear and 
irs workers gave the wrong answer 36 percent of the time to 
telephone callers who asked for advice earlier this year 
the irs must pay more attention to the problem of tax 
delinquencies that now total 56 billion the agency estimates that 
33 billion of that is collectible little has been done to 
determine why tax delinquencies occur gao said 
cutting the growing tax gap taxes owed but not paid must be 
a top priority the 1988 gap was estimated at 871 billion the 
figure is projected to hit 114 billion by 1992 gao called for more

soybean futures prices rebounded monday in 
afternoon trading to close sharply higher on the chicago board of 
trade 
corn finished mostly higher while wheat prices fell 
the turnaround in soybean prices followed steep daily declines in 
that market in six of the seven previous trading sessions mondays 
rally was due largely to profittaking by speculators who had sold 
contracts in earlier sessions in hopes of buying them back at lower 
prices analysts said 
the markets were oversold overdone overdue for a rally and it 
finally came today in all the pits except wheat said victor 
lespinasse a trader with dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
the soybean market led the rally but wheat did not participate 
because of disappointment over the failure so far of us and soviet 
negotiators to work out a new longterm grain sales agreement he 
said 
at the close wheat was cent to 3 cents lower with the contract 
for delivery in december at 408 a bushel corn was 1 cents lower 
to 3 cents higher with december at 261 a bushel oats were 2 
cents to 5 cents higher with december at 206 a bushel soybeans 
were cent to 15 cents higher with january at 746 a bushel

opec ministers quickly adjourned their 
formal talks monday and resumed private negotiations aimed at 
resolving a dispute between iran and iraq that is holding up a new 
production agreement 
the ministers met for about 90 minutes before putting off their 
formal talks until wednesday 
president rilwanu lukman opened the winter meeting of the 
13nation organization of petroleum exporting countries by appealing 
for compromise he said cartel members must reach a new accord 
limiting their oil production or risk a serious erosion of crude 
prices 
it may be necessary to take one step back now from our 
deepseated principles and beliefs in order to take two steps 
forward at a later date he said 
he said the cartels problems are formidable and yet they are 
not insuperable 
crude oil prices edged higher on the new york mercantile exchange 
in light trading as the market awaited definitive news on the 
progress of the talks contracts for january delivery of west texas 
intermediate the benchmark us crude rose 7 cents from fridays 
close to settle at 1298 cents per 42gallon barrel 
lukman said they had not yet discussed the crucial questions of 
oil production output quotas for member countries and pricing 
a few hours after the meeting the ministers resumed some of the 
private discussions they have been holding since late last week to 
try to resolve the issues separating iran and iraq 
the main obstacle has been iraqs insistence on a production 
ceiling equal to iran 
iranian oil minister gholamreza aghazadeh met with his algerian 
counterpart sadek boussena who appears to have become an emissary 
between iran and persian gulf countries 
after the meeting aghazadeh told reporters it was still too 
early to tell whether an agreement would be reached or not 
consultations he said will continue tuesday 
if we should see some proposal that is good we accept he 
said 
the ministers want to work out a new arrangement giving each 
country a production quota they want to include iraq in the system 
iraq refused to join in the current accord arranged in 1986 
i would be happier if i was inside the agreement said iraqi 
oil minister issam abdul raheem alchalabi 
aghazadeh again said he would oppose quota parity with iraq the 
two countries have had different ceilings for some time he said 
saudia arabia and kuwait have said they will not join a new quota 
system unless all 13 members belong 
the ministers want to use the new accord to cap their runaway 
production and lift weak prices opec maintains a benchmark price of 
18 a barrel but prices have been well under that 
lukman told the ministers as we are all aware prices have 
been hovering 5 to 6 per barrel below our targeted levels for 
several months now 
if we do not reach such an accord he said then i am 
afraid we may see a further serious erosion of these price levels 
to our mutual detriment 
aghazadeh said he has offered to meet with iraq saudi arabia 
kuwait and the united arab emirates to work out the quota dispute 
we can sit down to solve the problem and have a discussion 
about any matter he said i am very flexible 
he also said iran wants opec to give it a higher ceiling in any 
new agreement iran needs more revenues from its oil to help rebuild 
after the 8year war with iraq 
he said iran will be able within a year to boost its production 
of oil to more than 4 million barrels a day the country he said 
is currently pumping more than 3 million barrels a day and will 
boost that to about 33 million in a few months 
under the current production agreement iran has a ceiling of 24 
million barrels a day iraq although it refused to join the current 
accord has an allotment of 15 million barrels a day 
analysts estimate that iraq has been producing at least 26 
million barrels a day an amount that could soar to 37 million 
barrels in mid1989 with completion of a new pipeline through saudi 
arabia to the red sea 
opecs current output accord sets total production at about 15 
million barrels a day for 12 countries 
total cartel production in october was estimated by the 
international energy agency at nearly 211 million barrels the 
highest monthly level in more than five years 
aghazadeh has proposed that iraq be given export parity with 
iran that would allow iran to have a higher overall ceiling to 
account for its larger internal oil demand which it estimates at 1 
million barrels a day 
a possibility for resolving the dispute analysts suggested 
would be to give iraq a lower quota on paper but the difference in 
the ceilings would be made up by letting iraq keep a portion of the 
oil produced in an area called the neutral zone which is shared by 
saudi arabia and kuwait 
the discussions began thursday evening when the two opec 
committees price evolution and longterm strategy held formal 
talks 
countries belonging to those panels are indonesia saudi arabia 
iran iraq nigeria indonesia kuwait and venezuela 
other members are ecuador gabon libya qatar and the united 
arab emirates

the federal probe of a pennystock brokerage firms 
records continued monday as government spokesmen declined comment on 
what the investigation was seeking 
im afraid no one can make any comment said assistant us 
attorney howard zlotnick in las vegas nev where the current probe 
of denverbased blinder robinson amp co originated 
however steven b theyes blinder robinsons senior vice 
president on monday said the search warrant was directed at records 
of 53 investors none of whom are present or former officers 
directors stockbrokers or agents of blinder robinson and 16 
publicly traded issues none of which were underwritten by blinder 
robinson 
its their privilege to claim anything they want was 
zlotniks reply 
earlier blinder robinson lawyers said documents which agents 
for the internal revenue service and us treasury were looking for 
had been given to the securities and exchange commission months ago 
we are conducting business theyes said monday he noted 
however that business is being conducted at about 40 percent of 
normal strength in view of an agreement reached before a us 
district court judge in denver between the company and agents 
continuing their probe within the firms offices 
theyes said he had about 60 staffers working monday compared with 
a normal force of about 150 
theyes said he hoped the search of files would wind up monday 
night he said 24 treasury agents launched the probe with a federal 
search warrant saturday morning and that by midday monday the 
agents had confined their efforts to records in storage rooms 
the brokerage firm has 66 offices in 37 states nationwide and 
posted 1987 revenue of about 130 million it specializes in penny 
stocks which are cheap highrisk securities not usually traded on 
major stock exchanges 
blinder robinson has been the subject of earlier federal 
investigations involving allegations of fraud markups and 
misrepresentation 
last year the securities and exchange commission launched a 
probe of blinder robinson alleging that customers had been 
defrauded 
the sec also had two other actions pending against the company 
which was the nations largest pennystock broker those allegations 
accused the company of bookkeeping violations 
the national association of securities dealers levied penalties 
of 250000 against the company in 1987 for charging excessive 
markups in the price of shares for one of its issues 
the company was suspended from doing business for five days and 
six executives were suspended from the brokerage business for 90 
days

drexel burnham lambert inc requested a new 
hearing monday in its attempt to oust the judge presiding over the 
federal civilfraud case facing the wall street investment firm 
in a 15page petition to the 2nd us circuit court of appeals 
attorneys for drexel and other defendants asked a threejudge panel 
that had rejected their earlier request to rehear the matter refer 
it to the entire 12judge appellate bench or allow a separate 
hearing before another lower court judge 
last week the threejudge panel ruled 21 that drexels effort 
to disqualify us district judge milton pollack from the case on 
grounds of conflict of interest was unwarranted 
the defendants had argued that pollacks wife moselle stands to 
gain at least 30 million from the sale of her stock in palais royal 
inc a houstonbased retailer going private in a transaction drexel 
is helping finance 
drexels lawyers said the indirect relationship between drexel 
and pollacks family created the appearance of bias and required 
pollack to disqualify himself 
pollack an 82yearold jurist known for tough rulings in 
whitecollar fraud cases has denounced drexels maneuvering to oust 
him as a nonsensical ploy he has said his wifes business affairs 
have nothing to do with drexel 
some lawyers familiar with the drexel case have said they 
believed the defense maneuvering is part of a broader strategy to 
get a more lenient judge 
it was unclear how the 2nd circuit would respond to drexels 
request for a rehearing on pollack such requests are seldom granted 
drexel is facing numerous civil charges leveled by the securities 
and exchange commission in september that the firm conspired with 
nowimprisoned speculator ivan boesky to trade on inside 
information manipulate stock and commit other frauds the firm has 
denied the accusations 
in addition a federal grand jury has been considering whether to 
indict drexel and some key employees on criminal charges there has 
been persistent speculation that the charges could be announced soon

cocoa futures prices surged monday on new yorks coffee sugar amp 
cocoa exchange on fresh rumors that the ivory coast and france had 
reached an agreement to withhold large amounts of ivorian cocoa from 
the world market 
on other exchanges preciousmetals futures fell again grains 
and soybeans were mostly higher livestock and meat were mostly 
lower oil futures were mixed and stockindex futures advanced 
official word of a longanticipated ivorian cocoa withholding 
scheme appeared imminent monday afternoon after a senior delegate to 
the international cocoa organization icco reportedly said parties 
had agreed on the framework for the deal 
cocoa settled 30 to 48 higher with the contract for delivery in 
december at 1425 a metric ton 
but cocoa market analyst arthur stevenson of prudentialbache 
securities inc cautioned that rumors of an ivorianfranco 
withholding scheme had been running rampant in the market and that 
nothing had been formally announced 
thats been the situation that weve heard every day now for 
two weeks yet nothing changes stevenson said apparently 
something is in the works but i can only tell you it has not been 
confirmed by the french government 
under terms of a deal reported by knightridder financial news 
200000 metric tons of ivorian cocoa would be stored in europe 
100000 metric tons would be sold to the soviet union and 100000 
metric tons would be sold to the parisbased trade house sucre et 
denrees for gradual release onto the market 
the total of 400000 metric tons would represent more than half 
of the cocoa crop currently being harvested in the ivory coast the 
worlds largest cocoa producer 
the ivorians have been demanding exceptionally high premiums for 
their cocoa for more than a year in an attempt to bolster sagging 
prices worldwide a problem caused by several years of surplus cocoa 
production 
unable to sell much cocoa at its high asking price the former 
french colony ran out of storage space for this years crop and 
appealed to the french government for assistance in withholding 
cocoa from the market 
silver futures prices tumbled for the fifth straight day on new 
yorks commodity exchange reflecting slack investor demand and 
ample supplies 
the contract for december delivery fell to 598 a troy ounce 
during the session but bounced back to settle 55 cents below 
fridays close at 6025 the lowest comex silver price since march 
26 1987 
other silver contracts lost as much as 69 cents on the day 
i would say the next stop or point of firm support is 
somewhere between 550 and 560 said peter cardillo 
commodities trading adviser for josephthal amp co a new york 
brokerage firm 
gold settled 160 to 190 lower with december at 41650 a troy 
ounce 
soybean futures prices rebounded in afternoon trading to end 
sharply higher on the chicago board of trade corn finished mostly 
higher while wheat prices fell 
the turnaround in soybean prices followed steep daily declines in 
that market during six of the past seven trading sessions mondays 
rally was due largely to profittaking by speculators who had sold 
contracts in earlier sessions in hopes of buying them back at lower 
prices analysts said 
wheat settled cent to 2 cents lower with december at 408 a 
bushel corn was 1 cents lower to 2 cents higher with december at 
261 a bushel oats were 2 cents to 5 cents higher with december 
at 206 a bushel soybeans were 1 cent to 15 cents higher with 
january at 746 a bushel

1 record was 3122 million pounds in 1971 analysts said

the secondlargest monthly porkbelly stocks figure for any month on

the continued aggressive storage of pork bellies which are 
sliced to make bacon means prices eventually will collapse said

textile maker pepperell had asked the 11th us circuit court of 
appeals to stay a us district court ruling allowing the takeover 
bid and to grant an injunction postponing the bid while the lower 
court ruling was appealed 
a threejudge panel denied both motions but granted a pepperell 
motion for an expedited appeal 
pepperell had argued that an injunction would be only temporary 
and could not harm farley but that denial of one could cause serious 
harm to pepperell 
farley announced in may that it would try to buy pepperell 
farley owns about 98 percent of the companys stock it has offered 
around 157 billion or 48 a share for outstanding shares and 
associated rights of pepperell stock in an offer originally 
scheduled to expire at midnight monday 
we are pleased by the courts decision to deny pepperells 
application for a stay and also by its decision to expedite the 
hearing said william farley chief executive officer 
farley also said hes extending the offer to wednesday nov 30 
to expire at midnight new york time 
farley has secured financing but says three conditions must be 
met before it will complete the tender offer 
one is that pepperell remove the hurdle caused by its poison 
pill shareholders rights plan which allows shareholders not 
involved in a takeover attempt to buy additional pepperell shares in 
case of a buyout attempt this makes a buyout more expensive 
us district judge ernest tidwell invalidated two key aspects of 
the pill last week the rest remains in place where pepperell 
officials say they intend to keep it 
farley also wants georgias antitakeover statute ruled 
unconstitutional and insists that at least twothirds of pepperells 
shareholders tender their shares 
tidwell has taken the antitakeover statute under advisement but 
has not said when he might rule 
financing is the only thing farley has in the bag said josie 
esquivel an analyst for shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
even if shareholders tender 70 percent of their stock farley 
still has to meet the other two conditions 
farley manufactures fruit of the loom underwear pepperell 
products include gold toe socks

ltv corp reported on monday a thirdquarter net 
loss of 124 billion which company officials attributed largely to 
chapter 11related special charges 
a change in accounting principles for postemployment medical and 
life insurance benefits also had a negative impact on results 
officials of the diversified company said 
the loss compares with a net profit of 1097 million or 91 
cents a share in the third quarter of 1987 
ltv officials said the special charges and the accounting change 
are important elements in moving the company toward its chapter 11 
reorganization 
because ltv is in chapter 11 we believe it is appropriate for 
the company to record all its liabilities including the liability 
for these postemployment benefits so that they may be 
appropriately dealt with in the reorganization process said 
raymond hay ltvs chairman and chief executive officer 
angela tese a bankruptcy specialist for cole amp deitz in new 
york said mondays announcement of a negative net worth was not a 
good signal for the company 
theyll have to prove to the bankruptcy court that the plan 
is feasible tese said they are going to have to be able to 
demonstrate to the court that they are healthy enough and that they 
wont have to reorganize again sometime soon 
the thirdquarter special charges total 134 billion ost of 
which is noncash they include 
950 million for chapter 11 creditors claims 
350 million for a reduction of assets and other anticipated 
costs in the divesture of ltv steel cos bar business as well as 
additional costs incurred in the rationalization of other steel 
facilities 
41 million for the writeoff of goodwill recorded in connection 
with the companys 1983 acquisition of sierra research corp 
without the two elements ltv said its net income would have been 
1322 million for the third quarter and 4537 million for the 
first nine months of the year that would have compared with 1097 
million and 3620 million for the respective periods in 1987 
the change in accounting principle alters the method of 
accounting for postemployment medical and life insurance benefits 
and resulted in a onetime noncash charge of 226 billion 
recorded as of last jan 1 
the accounting method adopted by ltv recognizes the 
postemployment medical and life insurance benefits earned by all of 
the companys retirees and active employees hay said 
previously these costs were recognized only as they were paid 
the change in accounting principle reduced operating income by 
321 million for the third quarter and 982 million for the 
ninemonth period 
for the first nine months ltv reported a net loss of 325 
billion which company officials also attributed to the special 
charges and accounting change that compared with a net profit of 
3620 million or 307 a share in the same ninemonth period of 
1987

humorist art buchwald filed a 5 million 
lawsuit against paramount pictures on monday accusing the studio of 
stealing his idea for the movie coming to america one of last 
summers biggest hits 
its not only the biggest hit of the year it will probably be 
the biggest hit of the decade said buchwalds attorney pierce 
odonnell 
coming to america greeted with mixed reviews collected hugh 
box office receipts last summer trailing disneys hit who framed 
roger rabbit which has collected more than 147 million the 
trade newspaper daily variety said coming to america has grossed 
more than 120 million 
odonnell said buchwald is entitled to his promised share of an 
anticipated 250 million in profits for a story strikingly 
similar to the movie script 
he sold the idea to paramount odonnell said he told them 
you can change it fold spindle or mutilate it but you have to 
pay me 
the lawsuit filed in los angeles superior court is the second 
action disputing the origin of the hit movie which starred comedian 
eddie murphy 
eddie murphy wrote the story 100 percent said murphys 
manager bob wachs there are many suits on coming to america 
mr buchwald is one of the last to file he said 
we dont comment on matters of this kind said deborah rosen 
senior vice president of corporate communications for paramount 
murphy who is not named in buchwalds suit has said he came up 
with the original idea for coming to america the tale of an 
african prince who comes to new york works in a fast food 
restaurant and takes a wife 
buchwalds script called king for a day tells of a king 
from an oilrich country who comes to washington loses his power in 
a coup while hes absent winds up living in a ghetto where he works 
for a caterer and pursues a woman who works for the state department 
the coming to america story is similar but the action occurs 
in new york and murphys love interest is the daughter of the man 
who owns the fast food chain where he works 
buchwald said his story presented in an eightpage treatment 
was optioned by paramount in 1983 
but paramount officially dropped the project in january 1985 and 
buchwald subsequently sold the idea to warner bros which dropped 
it when word surfaced that paramount had a similar movie in 
production odonnell said the attorney said buchwald had an iron 
clad contract with paramount which called for him to receive a 
flat fee plus percentages of net profits when king for a day was 
produced 
the columnist said he has written about 10 hollywood screen 
treatments in the past and ive always gotten paid he said none 
of those ideas ever became a movie 
with more income expected from home video sales and foreign 
markets odonnell said the movie is expected to gross 250 million 
murphys manager said the actor came up with the idea said 
odonnell the problem is that murphy and his manager both read 
mr buchwalds story 
odonnell said he can prove that they read it based on his 
twomonth investigation of the case 
the lawsuit alleges breach of contract rather than copyright 
infringement a second plaintiff producer alain bernheim also is 
suing saying he had a contract to produce buchwalds script 
bernheim has produced such movies as racing with the moon and 
yes giorgio odonnell said 
the lawsuit seeks 5 million in compensatory damages and 
unspecified punitive damages 
odonnell said buchwald is not suing murphy because he was not a 
party to the paramount agreement 
another lawsuit pending in federal court also claims the original 
idea for coming to america was purloined 
shelby m gregory 38 of hollywood has filed a 10 million 
copyright lawsuit in los angeles federal court naming murphy two 
writers and paramount studios

hospital corporation of americas board 
of directors on monday approved a 36 billion leveraged buyout plan 
led by senior management just over a month after rejecting the 
offer 
the board of the nations largest health care concern announced 
late monday it had agreed to the 51 a share cash and securities 
offer by tf investments inc a company formed by hca management and 
headed by hca chairman and chief executive officer thomas f frist 
jr 
the groups offer includes 43 in cash and 8 in securities for 
each of hcas 714 million common shares outstanding 
hca stock closed up 62 cents at 4662 a share monday on the 
new york stock exchange 
the offer still must be approved by hca stockholders in a 
february meeting company officials stated in a news release no 
date was given for the meeting 
frist could be immediately reached for comment 
a special committee of outside directors had rejected the frist 
groups initial offer of 47 a share and rejected the 51 a share 
proposal on oct 17 the committee at that time indicated it would 
accept bids from other parties through nov 18 although a number of 
industry analysts expressed skepticism the company would get a 
higher offer 
the boards approval was based in part upon the recommendation 
of a special committee of board comprised of nine outside directors 
and the opinion of morgan stanley that as of nov 21 1988 the 
consideration to be paid in the merger is fair to hca shareholders 
from a financial point of view according to boards monday 
release 
hca spokesman john van mol said he did not know whether any other 
offers were made by the nov 18 deadline 
hca which owns or operates nearly 400 hospitals worldwide set 
up the special committee to consider buyout offers after the initial 
proposal in midseptember 
the company sold 104 of its less profitable hospitals just over a 
year ago to a new employeeowned company healthtrust inc in a 
spinoff that netted hca almost 16 billion

a federal judge will hear motions next month 
stemming from three jurors claims that they were intimidated into 
voting for an 815 million judgment against the maker of the copper 
7 intrauterine device monsanto co said monday 
monsanto whose gd searle amp co subsidiary manufactured the 
copper 7 on monday released a letter that the jurors sent to us 
district judge robert renner who presided over the trial 
the jury on sept 9 awarded the damages to esther kociemba who 
claimed the birth control device had left her infertile 
the three jurors whose names were withheld at their request 
also indicated they did not believe the plaintiff proved her claim 
that the device caused her injuries 
the judgment represented the first jury award of punitive damages 
against searle in a copper 7 case the pharmaceutical company has 
won 15 of 19 copper 7 damage cases that have gone before a jury 
monsanto spokesman mark l schannon said searle attorneys would 
introduce motions to vacate the award 
renner will hear the motions dec 1 in us district court at st 
paul minn schannon said renner can let the verdict stand reduce 
the award or order a new trial schannon said 
the letter from the three jurors claimed that continual verbal 
harassment and intimidation by the jury foreman during 
deliberations prevented them from expressing their opinion about the 
trial evidence 
our failure to understand the purpose andor power of the jury 
foreman facilitated our inability to express individual opinions 
the letter read 
the three jurors also stated that a desire to inform the court of 
a 44 split among jury was prevented by a convenient 
interpretation of the jury and judges instructions 
any opinions which conflicted with the foremans plaintiffs 
views were met with disdain and contempt and resulted in additional 
verbal andor physical harassment the letter said when the 
obvious difference of opinion became apparent discussions and 
negotiations ceased 
while believing that searle may have been negligent in 
advertising we individually assessed that esther kociemba never 
proved that the cu7 caused her injuries the letter read 
summarily we individually and collectively feel ashamed and 
embarrassed to be associated with a verdict against our true 
opinions the three wrote 
richard s duesenberg monsantos general counsel said the 
jurors wrote the letter on their own initiative and neither monsanto 
nor searle saw the letter until it was received by renner 
this is an important letter for our shareholders for two 
reasons first the plaintiffs attorneys failed to convince the 
full jury that the cu7 cause the plaintiffs injuries and second 
this case should not be viewed as a watershed duesenberg said 
in minnesota mrs kociembas attorney issued a statement 
labeling the letter legally irrelevant and accusing searle lawyers 
of having met with the three jurors 
this is simploy a desperate and futile attempt by searle and 
monsanto to achieve a result they couldnt achieve in court 
stated lawyer michael ciresi this is nothing more than 
postverdict jury tampering
