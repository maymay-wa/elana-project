president bush eased economic sanctions 
against china on tuesday as secretary of state james a baker iii 
expressed regrets he may have misled americans about highlevel 
us contacts with beijing 
the white house announced that bush had approved the export of 
three communications satellites to be launched by china and had 
ended a prohibition on the exportimport bank providing help to 
companies doing business in china 
the presidents actions came as baker said through a spokeswoman 
he regretted that in a recent television interview he may have 
misled the public about the two trips to china by highlevel us 
officials 
whether the administration was misleading the public prompted 
close questioning of white house spokesman marlin fitzwater who 
mounted a vigorous defense of president bushs secret contact with 
the chinese leadership 
the furor erupted after it was learned monday that national 
security adviser brent scowcroft and deputy secretary of state 
lawrence eagleburger had visited beijing in secret in july in 
addition to their previously disclosed trip earlier this month 
bush notified congress that he was exempting the three 
communications satellites which are being built or renovated by 
the hughes aircraft co from economic sanctions imposed on china 
after last junes crackdown in tiananmen square hughes is selling 
the satellites to firms in australia and hong kong for launch on a 
chinese rocket 
the sale of these satellites represents approximately 300 
million worth of business for us firms said a statement by 
fitzwater 
the statement said the move was consistent with the 
presidents expressed determination in imposing sanctions last 
june to maintain commercial relations with china 
the july trip came at a time when the administration said 
highlevel visits to beijing were banned because of the violent 
suppression of prodemocracy demonstrations in june 
baker appearing on abctv dec 10 called the december trip by 
scowcroft and eagleburger the first time weve had highlevel 
us officials go to the peoples republic of china baker noted 
he himself had publicly met high chinese officials in other 
countries 
asked about the apparent discrepancy spokeswoman margaret d 
tutwiler said tuesday that baker felt obligated to protect the 
secrecy of a mission that the president wished to have classified 
he regrets that me may have misled some 
she added he felt that by acknowledging his own direct 
involvement it was sufficient to make the point that this december 
trip was not the first case of highlevel contact 
before that statement she had said baker did not feel he had 
lied 
on the satellites the white house statement said approval of 
these licences is in keeping with the presidents policy not to 
disrupt normal commercial relations with china 
sen albert gore dtenn called bushs approval a true 
outrage and another effort to curry favor with the hardliners 
in beijing and an insult to the memory of those who died for 
democracy in tiananmen square 
gore sponsored the legislation that forbids the launch of 
usmanufacturered satellites chinese rockets unless the president 
declares it to be in the us national interest as bush has done 
before the satellite announcement rep stephen solarz dny 
said bushs sending of highlevel emissaries to china after the 
violent chinese crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators makes 
the president look like a wimp in beijing and a hypocrite in 
washington his comments were in a statement issued while he was 
traveling in nepal 
facing criticism from members of congress that the 
administration has been too friendly with china in the aftermath of 
the june crackdown the white house issued a separate twopage 
justification of the satellite action 
after launch they will be controlled for civil use the 
white house statement said it is in the national interest of the 
united states to approve export licernses for the three satellites 
currently being prepared for launch in china 
two of the satellites are being built by hughes aircraft co for 
aussat an australian company the other one is being refurbished 
by hughes for asiasat based in hong kong 
the white house also cited national interest in waiving 
restrictions on the exportimport banks financing of us business 
activities within china 
the bank is a government agency which helps provide a range of 
assistance to us companies including lowinterest loans to help 
them set up overseas operations 
the white house said the waiver preserves a level playing 
field for us business additional business activity with china 
will be considered on a casebycase basis as part of a continuing 
review process 
fitzwater under close questioning by reporters declared bush 
had not misled americans as critics contended 
it is not misleading to not tell you about everything hes 
doing fitzwater said 
at the state departments daily briefing tutwiler was asked 
whether she felt the american public had been misled on us policy 
toward china 
i certainly dont think that ive lied she said i know 
marlin doesnt think that hes lied secretary of state james a 
baker doesnt think hes lied and the president doesnt think hes 
lied 
fitzwater said he could not comment on whether there had been 
other trips to china that still remained secret 
but he said there have been trips you dont know about there 
will be more 
fitzwater said bush dispatched scowcroft and eagleburger in july 
to make sure that chinas hardline leaders knew the seriousness of 
us anger over the crushing of the prodemocracy demonstrations 
he said it was important to keep the trip secret so the chinese 
knew that denunciations of the crackdown were more than public 
posturing 
denying that the administration had violated its own ban on 
exchanges with china fitzwater said there never was any intention 
to cut off all highlevel contact he said there was a distinction 
between highlevel exchanges and highlevel contacts

a lawyer was killed when a mail bomb 
exploded in his office monday and federal agents said there were 
strong similarities to the mail bomb found at an atlanta 
courthouse and the mail bomb killing death of a federal judge in 
alabama 
robert robinson a city alderman and civil rights activist died 
of his wounds at 825 pm while undergoing surgery at memorial 
medical center about 3 hours after the 5 pm bomb blast said 
hospital spokesman michael rowan 
he lost his right arm his left hand and some upper body 
tissue and suffered severe damage to his legs fellow alderman 
floyd adams said earlier 
robinson was not able to communicate with doctors when he was 
brought in to the hospital after the blast around 5 pm said 
jeryl davis another hospital spokesman 
a mail bomb killed 11th us circuit of appeals judge robert 
vance in mountain brook ala on saturday earlier monday a bomb 
mailed to the 11th circuit in atlanta was discovered and removed 
safely 
at a news conference late monday fbi special agent bob deloach 
said it was definitely a possibility that white supremacists 
sent the bomb that killed robinson 
deloach and special agent william hinshaw said the fbi is 
warning lawyers judges and naacp activists in georgia and alabama 
to beware of strange packages 
hinshaw also said the fbi has warned the naacp that the attacks 
apparently are related to the aug 22 1989 teargas bomb mailed 
to naacps atlanta offices in which eight people including a 
4month old child were injured 
postal inspector john paul confirmed that the postal service is 
investigating the robinson slaying as well as vances because 
robinson was killed by a bomb that was in a package mailed to his 
office 
police told the mayors office that robinson had received a 
package similar to whats been happening in atlanta and 
birmingham said clerk of council dyanne reese 
the preliminary investigation indicates strong similarities to 
the other explosive devices fbi agent tom moore said in 
birmingham ala where authorities were investigating vances 
assassination 
the explosive and incendiary device experts from the fbi and 
postal authorities who were in birmingham yesterday and in atlanta 
today are being flown into savannah moore said 
robinson represented the national association for the 
advancement of colored people in a longrunning desegregation case 
against the savannah school system said state rep jim pannell of 
savannah 
pannell who attended the university of georgia law school with 
robinson said robinson was one of the first black students to 
attend savannah high school in the 1960s 
he said robinson handled many criminal defense and personal 
injury cases but he said he could not recall any which would have 
supplied a motive for the bombing

postponed twice earlier this month by weather and technical 
problems 
the titan 3 is to boost into orbit communications satellites for 
a japanese company and the british ministry of defense

heeding the warnings of two senators the us 
customs service says it wont buy a third hightech radar plane 
until the two existing problemplagued aircraft can locate and 
track airborne drug smugglers 
in a letter released monday the customs service acknowledged 
however that the computerized radar systems in the p3 airborne 
early warning aircraft wont be fixed until june half a year 
after the most recent estimate 
the planes are the governments frontline response to 
intercepting drug flights which carried an estimated 51 percent of 
the cocaine seized during 1988 to the united states 
the associated press reported in november that the radar systems 
experienced problems since the moment the first plane arrived in 
june 1988 at the customs service surveillance support center in 
corpus christi texas 
dennis deconcini dariz and pete domenici rnm wrote to 
the agency nov 12 saying a third plane should not be ordered 
until the two aircraft currently being operated meet the 
overall aircraft performance standards originally intended 
deconcini is chairman and domenici the ranking minority member 
of the senate appropriations subcommittee that controls the customs 
service budget the planes are made by lockheed aeronautical 
systems co which predicted in november the problems should be 
corrected around the end of this year 
the firstoftheirkind planes were designed to find and track 
smuggler aircraft and guide government interceptors chasing the 
drug pilots but internal agency documents revealed that computer 
failures severely hampered this mission however the planes have 
continued flying while the customs service attempted to fix the 
problems 
in response to the senators william rosenblatt the customs 
service assistant commissioner for enforcement wrote we will 
not enter into a contractual agreement for the third aircraft until 
such time as we are entirely satisfied that the originally 
intended performance standards are met and until the senators 
give their approval 
rosenblatts letter was written last week and released to the ap 
monday by deconcini the senator a strong advocate of the 
airplanes said in a statement that hes satisfied the customs 
service has responded in a responsible manner and has 
established a schedule to rectify the deficiencies 
i am satisfied he said that the agency is insuring the 
viability of the air interdiction program while insisting that the 
contractor live up to the terms of the contract 
the first p3 aew cost 27 million and the second was bought for 
306 million if the third plane is ordered it would be expected 
in 1992 
everyone was being a little optimistic in estimates that the 
problems would be fixed by the end of this year agency spokesman 
dick weart said monday extensive testing by lockheed will take 
longer than anticipated he said 
rosenblatt said the agency is withholding 15 million from 
lockheed until the detection system is fixed and until the company 
also replaces the cockpit windshields a separate problem that has 
hampered pilot visibility 
rosenblatt said lockheed is attempting to fix 
the tracker which automatically provides computer displays 
on a targets course speed and altitude radar operators have 
complained the readings are so inaccurate that they cant 
effectively guide customs service interceptors to a smuggler 
aircraft some crewmen said they worried they could direct their 
interceptors into a collision with a smuggler aircraft 
the system used by the p3 aew planes to interrogate the 
transponder signals of other aircraft to determine their 
identification and location the p3 interrogation signal is so 
powerful that planes that may be 300 miles away appear on computer 
screens as nearby targets 
the special windshields built to prevent magnetic interference 
from the radar the windshields originally installed have 
interfered with pilot visibility

the delay of columbias satellite 
rescue mission until after the holidays sets up 10 space shuttle 
flights in 1990 nasas heaviest schedule ever 
columbia is essentially ready to fly so if we get it off 
early next year we dont believe there will be any added pressure 
on the rest of the schedule kennedy space center director 
forrest s mccartney said monday after the postponement was 
announced 
the launch had been scheduled for thursday but was put off until 
jan 8 to allow more time to correct launch pad problems and to let 
most of the centers 16000 workers go home for the holidays 
the most shuttle flights conducted in one year was nine in 
1985 before the 1986 challenger explosion that grounded the 
program for 32 months 
two missions were flown in 1988 there were five this year as 
the national aeronautics and space administration has been 
gradually building toward 12 a year by 1992 
shuttle managers decided to postpone columbias liftoff after 
assessing progress on lagging work at renovated pad 39a which has 
not been used since before the challenger accident a series of pad 
problems mainly with the fueling systems caused two previous 
short postponements of the mission which is to deploy one 
satellite and retrieve another that is falling to earth 
the team worked very hard to get columbia off before 
christmas but the added work of going off a refurbished launch pad 
and a new mobile launch platform really slowed us down said 
william b lenoir nasas associate administrator for space flight 
the long delay also will enable the agency to essentially shut 
down the center as it usually does the last week of each year to 
allow employees to take longplanned vacations and to permit an 
annual electrical power shutdown so that aging computer and other 
systems and components can be overhauled 
a launch attempt next week would have cost nasa considerable 
overtime pay and would have pushed off the power shutdown to 1990 
possibly disrupting work on other shuttle flights 
the launch crews have worked hard this year and they have 
earned a christmas vacation mccartney said 
astronaut dan brandenstein who will command columbia said he 
and his crew were disappointed about the delay but we are happy 
to know we will be spending christmas with our loved ones 
well get a good running start at launch after the holidays and we 
cant think of a better way to start a promising new decade 
the five astronauts are to spend 10 days in space they will 
release a navy communications satellite and then track down and 
recover the science satellite a 21400pound laboratory that has 
orbited the globe nearly six years 
columbias launch is not as urgent as it once was a few months 
ago it was believed that the science satellite the astronauts will 
retrieve the long duration exposure facility would fall back to 
earth in january that estimate later was revised to midfebruary 
and just last week to midmarch

women in the work force and the popularity of 
microwave ovens are pressuring the food industry to convert farm 
products not just to food but to readymade meals says an 
agriculture publication 
retailers distributors and processors are the first to be 
buffeted by changes in consumer demands says the article in 
choices written by benjamin senauer university of minnesota 
professor of agriculture and applied economics 
but in many cases these consumerdriven changes work their way 
through the food system back to the farmer 
senauer points out that consumers got so hot for oat products 
which are supposed to reduce cholesterol that farmers couldnt 
keep up leading food processors to turn to imports 
women in the labor force jumped from 35 percent in 1960 to 55 
percent in 1987 says the author for married women 3544 years 
old it doubled from 36 percent to 72 percent during the same 
period 
some 75 percent of american households own microwave ovens and 
over 60 percent of all the workers in the united states have access 
to a microwave on the job he said 
these statistics have contributed to a new category of eater 
that one food company calls the chase and grabbits also known 
as yuppies considered 26 percent of the market 
other categories into which the pillsbury co according to 
senauer put consumers and the share of the market they hold are 
functional feeders 18 percent older couple with husband in 
bluecollar job interested in traditional meals in convenient ways 
down home stokers 21 percent lower income traditional 
regional or ethnic eaters 
careful cooks 20 percent better educated older frequently 
retired higher income want a healthy nutritious diet with 
emphasis on enjoyment 
happy cookers 15 percent a couple in which one or both enjoy 
cooking or baking want basic ingredients and will pay for quality 
the happy cookers and chase and grabbits are the growing 
segments of the market says senauer 
another food trend that affects farmers more directly is the 
movement away from products sprayed with chemicals toward 
organically grown fruits and vegetables 
senauer cites a 1989 survey by the food marketing institute that 
said 82 percent of the consumers who responded rated pesticides and 
herbicide residues as a serious health hazard 
however 81 percent said they were completely confident or 
mostly confident that the food in grocery stores is safe 
senauer said that to avoid consumer panic that can hurt farmers 
and foodrelated businesses the government and food industry 
both need to be sensitive to the publics need for adequate and 
accurate information about the safety of food and thereby actively 
work to maintain consumer confidence in the food system 
besides worrying about chemicals consumers are more concerned 
than ever about the nutritional value of their food 
the average american consumes 37 percent of his or her 
calories in the form of fat down from 40 percent in 1977 said 
senauer 
this shows up on the farm in decreased demand for products high 
in saturated fat such as animal shortening butter and whole milk 
more cuts can be expected if americans ever get to the 
recommended 30 percent fat content in their daily diet said 
senauer

cattle being fed for the slaughter market as 
of dec 1 in the seven major beef states totaled 813 million head 
up 2 percent from a year ago but 3 percent below the level of two 
years ago says the agriculture department 
marketings of fed cattle in november totaled 150 million 
head fractionally below a year ago but 1 percent below two years 
ago according to the report monday 
the placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last 
month was reported at 199 million head up 18 percent from a year 
ago and 22 percent more than two years ago 
this was the largest november placement total since 1977 and 
the result of cattle moving into feedlots rather than going onto 
wheat pastures 
state feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven 
states which account for about threefourths of the nations beef 
the first number is the number of cattle in thousands as of dec 
1 and the second number is the percentage of a year earlier

the government had clear evidence shortly 
after the first nuclear bombs were built in the 1940s that weapons 
workers were being exposed to potentially dangerous amounts of 
radiation according to a congressional report 
despite this information including some not previously made 
public officials overseeing the bomb factories recommended not 
informing workers of the possible health risks they faced at the 
secretly operated facilities the report said 
the us nuclear weapons program was exposing large numbers of 
workers to potentially dangerous health risks but did nothing to 
warn them said sen john glenn dohio in releasing the report 
on monday 
the report was prepared by the majority staff of the senate 
governmental affairs committee which glenn chairs the panel is 
investigating the health research programs of the energy 
department which owns the 17 major facilities that design and make 
nuclear arms 
more than 600000 people have worked at the weapons plants over 
the past 45 years 
the report focused mainly on the period 194754 when the atomic 
energy commission the predecessor to the energy department was 
rapidly expanding nuclear arms production amid deep suspicions 
about soviet and other foreign development of the bomb 
records of an october 1948 meeting of an aec advisory committee 
indicated that enough was known then about releases of radiation at 
the hanford plutonium plant near richland wash to raise concern 
about workers health yet it was decided at the meeting not to 
recommend closing hanford temporarily while action was taken to 
stop the release of plutonium particles into the air 
despite the concerns about health dangers a counterbalancing 
concern was the perceived need fueled by cold war fears to 
continue plutonium production because of the relatively small size 
of the us nuclear arsenal in 1948 the report said 
the report quoted a committee report from the october 1948 
meeting as saying there is no scientific evidence that it is an 
unwarranted hazard to continue the present process for six weeks 
during which steps will be taken vigorously to control the 
hazard the control measures apparently were not fully successful 
in december 1948 the manager of the federal oak ridge weapons 
plant in tennessee recommended to the aecs advisory committee that 
workers who quit the weapons program be told if they had exceeded 
radiation exposure limits the report said the manager also 
recommended providing medical aid if a former worker developed a 
radiationrelated illness 
the advisory panel rejected the recommendations the report 
said instead it recommended to the aec that a terminating 
employee should be advised at the exit interview as to the care 
that the aec utilizes in protecting each employee 
the documents uncovered by the glenn committee indicated that a 
major concern at the hanford facility was the release of huge 
numbers of plutonium particles the problem dating at least to 
1947 was traced to corroded fanduct work in the stacks of two 
plutonium chemical separations plants 
a march 1948 report by dr herbert m parker director of the 
hanford health instruments department of general electric co 
which ran the facility for the government said an average of about 
74 billion particles were being released from the two plants each 
month 
parker wrote that the critical hazard is to the inhalation and 
lung retention of particles which he said can produce 
radiation damage at the time it was estimated that a worker 
could be inhaling about 16 radioactive particles per month 
this suggests that over a oneyear period a worker could have 
inhaled an amount of plutonium that is more than twice the current 
official lifetime lung burden allowed for energy department 
workers the glenn report said

monday 
i have allowed the families to meet with the plo and to some 
family members even to travel to tunisia rabin said 
to get information family members may hold meetings without

no positive results 
rabin said another israeli soldier samir assad who disappeared 
in 1982 in lebanon was kidnapped and apparently killed

offered to exchange assads body for 50 captive guerrillas israel 
has turned down the offer 
two other israeli soldiers yosef fink and rachamim alsheikh 
were kidnapped in southern lebanon in february 1986 
rabin spoke a day after the wife of an israeli airman captured 
three years ago in lebanon said israeli authorities told her that 
her husband ron arad was still alive and being held by iranians 
the statement over israeli radio stations was intended to be a 
public message to the iranians who have control over those who 
are holding ron arad said defense ministry adviser on prisoners 
of war uri slonim 
arad a navigator was shot down with an f4 phantom fighter jet 
during an israeli bombing mission in southern lebanon on oct 16 
1986 the planes pilot was rescued by israeli troops

white students are more likely than black 
students to use all kinds of drugs from liquor to cocaine and 
hallucinogens according to a nationwide survey of drug use by 
sixth to 12th grade students 
for all too long this problem has been portrayed as a black 
problem and i think the end result has been that there are some 
people who have not really cared a lot about it because of that 
said judge reggie walton associate director of the office of 
national drug control policy 
this is an american problem not just a black problem and all 
of us have to get on with the business of dealing with this 
problem because i believe that if we do that that we can in 
fact prevail walton said 
the figures from the parents resource institute for drug 
education inc were released monday 
fifteen percent of the 58898 black students surveyed nationwide 
said cocaine was very easy to get compared with 8 percent of 
the 296180 white students surveyed according to the pride results 
however totals for cocaine use and for use of liquor 
marijuana hallucinogens and stimulants as well in junior high 
schools senior high schools and the senior year of high school 
showed that across the board a higher percentage of white students 
than black students were using drugs 
it goes against conventional wisdom particularly television 
has portrayed the problem of drug abuse in the united states as a 
black inner city problem said doug hall vice president of 
pride 
the focus on innercity drug use by blacks feeds the 
increasing expressions of racism that surface daily in our 
country pride cofounder marsha keith schuchard said at a news 
conference monday 
atlantabased pride surveyed the students at 958 schools in 38 
states during the 198889 school year including students in 
innercity areas in atlanta chicago dallas houston new york and 
washington dc hall said 
of the 40000 high school seniors surveyed only 4 percent of 
the black students said they had used cocaine at least once in the 
previous year while 7 percent of the white students said they had 
done so 
meanwhile 11 percent of black male seniors and 12 percent of 
white male seniors said they used marijuana very frequently 
meaning at least once a week fourteen percent of black male 
seniors and 17 percent of white male seniors said they used liquor 
very frequently 
the students surveyed filled out anonymous questionnaires that 
were spot checked internally with somewhat duplicated questions to 
determine the truthfulness of responses there also were occasional 
retests of groups of students hall said there was no overall 
margin of error because the results were based on actual responses 
and the survey was not a scientific random poll 
the surveys findings for overall drug use by seniors in high 
school totals for senior high school students including 12th 
graders and junior high school students were 
cocaine 7 percent of white seniors 4 percent of black 
seniors 5 percent of white high school students 3 percent of 
black high school students 2 percent of white junior high 
students 1 percent of black junior high students 
liquor 65 percent of white seniors 37 percent of black

national educational organizations are lining 
up behind broadcaster ted turner in a campaign to put his 
commercialfree news into high school classrooms instead of 
commercially sponsored channel one 
associations representing administrators principals teachers 
parents and school board members appeared at a news conference 
monday with turner to promote use of cnn newsroom the daily 
15minute program produced by turner broadcasting system of atlanta 
spokesmen for several groups coupled their endorsement with 
charges that channel one a daily 12minute program produced by 
whittle communications of knoxville tenn amounts to commercial 
exploitation of students 
jeremiah floyd associate executive director of the national 
school boards association although reaffirming his groups 
previous support for the turner show did not criticize channel one 
it is a local proposition and if thats the only game in town 
and the local people decide they want to go with that game then 
thats their prerogative floyd said 
channel one also was criticized for offering to install 
television sets video recorders and satellite dishes at 
participating schools 
exploitation of a captive audience in the classroom using the 
classroom and the curriculum as a marketplace for products rather 
than a marketplace for ideas and selling or trading students in a 
classroom for a satellite dish or a television monitor are 
outrageous breaches of ethical practice said gary marx 
associate executive director of the american association of school 
administrators 
a spokesman for whittle communications david gerard 
interviewed by telephone at his office in nashville tenn 
defended the use of commercial sponsors 
we are not introducing advertising to schools gerard said 
arguing that newspapers and magazines with advertising have long 
been used as teaching tools 
he said the company will have sold about 200 million worth of 
advertising on channel one by the end of the year whittle tested 
its program in six schools for seven weeks last spring and plans to 
begin national broadcasting in march 
scott thompson executive director of the national association 
of secondary school principals said the organization has written 
to all of the companies that advertise on channel one explaining 
his groups objections 
i am delighted that a number of these companies for their own 
reasons have decided not to continue sponsoring channel one 
thompson said 
he said no company had written back to say that it planned to 
continue its sponsorship although he understood that the mampm mars 
candy company one of the sponsors during the spring test intended 
to do so 
contacted at the companys headquarters in hackensack nj 
hans fiuczynski director of external relations for mampm mars said 
the company received such a letter from the association during the 
spring test of channel one 
he said mampm mars replied that it was aware that the program was 
controversial but understood that it had been approved by local 
school boards in the test communities as to whether the candy 
company would be a sponsor of the national news program fiuczynski 
said it was against the companys policy to disclose future 
marketing plans 
turner president of turner broadcasting said cnn newsroom had 
an enrollment of 1000 schools when it was launched in august and 
now has 5000 he said he expects to reach 10000 by the start of 
the next school year in september 
whittle communications said in november that it had 1050 
schools lined up the company has said it hopes to expand this to 
8000 schools by the end of 1990 
with turner at the news conference were thompson marx floyd 
and keith geiger president of the national education association 
and tari marshall director of public relations for the national 
parentteacher association

if your child tells you santa promised 
something outrageous i know the reason santa doesnt always hear 
so well 
i should know i was santa for a few hours anyway 
did she tell you what she wants for christmas the mother 
asked hurrying over after her youngest and shyest child had her 
turn with st nick 
i didnt understand her santa replied 
oh well she wont tell us and we had hoped the mother 
trailed away smiling and accompanied by a laugh that wasnt a 
hohoho 
to help me catch the childrens words i kept a small tape 
recorder at my side playing back the tape the only speaker always 
clear was the one on the mall intercom will the owner of the 
blue ford parked 
the little blond girl spoke softly and santa couldnt make out 
her name asked what she wanted for christmas she said a 
ball or was it a doll 
sunday was santas busiest day of the week at the southridge 
mall tracey bruner rayhons the malls marketing director agreed 
to let me sit in for the regular santa to hear childrens dreams 
ms rayhons had one condition dont promise them anything we 
had one santa last year we never did find out which one it was 
who promised the kids anything they wanted boy did we have some 
parents angry she said 
when i tried on a santa suit i found my doctor hadnt lied no 
padding was needed mike wiley one of four santas working at 
southridge had some pointers before i left for santas seat 
the children will be well behaved he said 
ive had a couple who like to pull the beard but i dont 
think any of us have been wet on yet i think weve all been real 
lucky 
he said children are a lot more mellow this year they dont 
ask for a whole lot what theyre asking for is for one gift 
thats expensive like a nintendo bicycle vcr television like 
theyre asking for one thing and thats all 
in my hour and a half as santa i found he was right 
but i also found out more 
most children were eager to sit on santas knee the only 
beardpullers were a couple of toddlers looking for something to 
hang on to 
some young ones liked the idea of seeing santa from a distance 
up close was a different matter it was just hang on to mommy and 
maybe next year 
there were times when managements advice came in handy 
with don on my left knee asking for a real puppy and sister 
misty on my right knee asking for a bicycle and a real kitty 
cat it may have been best not to promise anything 
when a petite brunette named allison sat on my knee her father 
piped in she hasnt been cleaning her room like she should 
she confirmed that but promised i will when i get home 
not only that but she said she would keep her room clean until 
christmas and even after christmas all she wants is a dolly that 
cries 
and there was elizabeth who also asked for a doll that cries 
and a puppy she also gave something back 
want to hear a secret she suddenly asked looking at santa 
she whispered in santas ear i love you santa claus 
ohhh santa claus loves you too

the venerable corcoran gallery of art is 
looking for a new director to succeed christina orrcahall the 
victim of harsh criticism for canceling an exhibit last summer that 
contained sexually explicit photographs 
after less than two years on the job ms orrcahall resigned 
monday in the hope that my decision will help to eliminate or 
abate those extraneous and disruptive difficulties that have 
plagued the corcoran for the past six months 
the corcoran board of trustees agreed overwhelmingly to accept 
her resignation effective feb 1 gallery president freeborn g 
jewett jr praised her professional skill courage and loyalty 
and said she had always acted in the utmost good faith 
jewett said he would appoint a search committee within a week to 
nominate a successor to ms orrcahall who plunged the 
120yearold corcoran into a maelstrom last june when she canceled 
an exhibition of works by the late photographer robert mapplethorpe 
two weeks before the show was scheduled to open july 1 
ms orrcahall said she was trying to avoid embroiling the 
corcoran the oldest art gallery in washington and the third oldest 
private museum in the country in an impending congressional battle 
over grantmaking policies of the national endowment for the arts 
sen jesse helms rnc and other conservative members of 
congress bitterly attacked the endowment an independent federal 
agency for underwriting the national tour of the mapplethorpe 
show which contained homoerotic and sadomasochistic images and 
pictures of nude children 
the exhibit organized by the institute of contemporary arts in 
philadelphia had appeared in philadelphia and chicago without 
incident after the corcorans cancellation it was shown before 
large crowds at the washington project for the arts another local 
private gallery 
ms orrcahalls cancellation which the corcoran board approved 
on two occasions was severely criticized by the artistic 
community artists protesting that the corcoran was stifling 
freedom of expression withdrew plans for two exhibitions of 
contemporary art at the corcoran and threatened the opening of a 
third show 
artist lowell nesbitt withdrew a 15 million bequest to the 
corcoran from his will and said he would give the money instead to 
the phillips collection another private washington art gallery 
plummeting staff morale worsened when jane livingston the 
corcorans chief curator resigned she had arranged for the 
mapplethorpe show to appear at the gallery a representative of the 
staff asked ms orrcahall to resign at one point but she refused 
in her resignation letter to the corcoran trustees ms 
orrcahall former chief curator of the oakland museum in 
california said it was time for the corcoran to look to the future 
and to make every effort to assure that it is not consumed by the 
kind of contention that distracts the institution from achieving 
its goals 
jewett said in a statement that the mapplethorpe controversy 
has interfered with the corcorans capacity to address its full 
energies and attention to the curatorial and educational tasks of 
the museum and the school that are the institutions fundamental 
responsibilities 
the board appointed a special committee in september to study 
ways to repair the damage one member board chairman david lloyd 
kreeger told reporters that panel was divided over whether ms 
orrcahall should stay or leave the corcoran 
the panel he said left the decision up to the full board 
which he said also was divided the dispute was resolved last 
weekend when the director indicated her intention to quit she 
delivered her resignation letter to jewett shortly before the board 
met at midday monday 
kreeger said the board was not concerned about the mapplethorpe 
cancellation which ms orrcahall had admitted was a mistake but 
was upset by the continued barrage of criticism that had 
tarnished the corcorans reputation 
expressing hope that ms orrcahalls resignation will lay the 
controversy to rest kreeger vowed that there is going to be a 
resurgent and a new and dynamic corcoran

a texas nuclear weapons assembly plant where 
radioactive gas was accidentally released last spring was 
unprepared for such an emergency an energy department advisory 
committee says 
it is still unclear that effective control of the situation by 
an adequately prepared response team ever took place john f 
ahearne chairman of the advisory committee on nuclear facility 
safety said in a letter about the pantex plant in amarillo texas 
the letter to energy secretary james d watkins released 
monday also raised questions about safety and environmental 
practices at pantex the nations only final assembly plant for 
nuclear bombs and missile warheads 
the committee said the response to the may release of tritium a 
radioactive gas was of variable quality 
radiation specialists and technicians responded properly to 
minimize workers exposure at the plant the report said 
missing was recognition that this unlikely event could take 
place and thus adequate procedures instrumentation and training 
were lacking the letter said 
although a quick and effective evacuation was conducted 
thereafter events are marked by confusion misread instruments 
and uncertain actions there appeared to be no plan to handle what 
surely must be an anticipated accident the report said 
pantex spokesman tom walton said the plant has begun correcting 
problems or will be addressing those in the very near future 
some safety violations were corrected on the spot 
the report said cleaning up the facility after the accident was 
estimated to cost 1 million and the psychological trauma on the 
individuals exposed 
exposure to workers however was below federal guidelines 
limiting radiation exposure and offsite exposure was trivial 
the letter said the committee found a lack of belief that 
pantex can have radiological accidents in spite of the recent 
tritium accident 
a tiger team of government and outside experts also recently 
inspected the plant and found pantex would be unable to respond 
effectively to emergencies involving releases of radioactive 
material 
watkins said those findings indicate workers lack adequate 
protection from emergency and routine exposure to radioactive 
releases and that the situation must be corrected immediately 
the advisory committee which spent two days in amarillo last 
month found an apparent lack of sophistication and depth 
regarding environmental problems at pantex 
monitoring of possible ground water contamination with wells at 
pantex also has been less than systematic the letter said 
this issue has just not received a great deal of attention 
this is particularly unfortunate since ground water contamination 
if found would be a threat to the sole source of drinking water 
for the area the letter said

in the past 20 years italys roman catholic church 
has lost battles on divorce and abortion now it is facing a 
challenge to its affluence as well as its influence 
starting jan 1 the italian government will no longer provide a 
guaranteed stipend to the church ending a system that has been in 
place in one form or another for 300 years 
instead the government will create a special pool made up of 
8 percent of tax revenues or about 650 million 
when filling out their tax returns in may citizens can check 
whether they want the money to go to the catholic church other 
churches or to the government for its social and cultural programs 
we are moving toward selfsufficiency for the church said 
monsignor tino marchi president of the italian bishops 
conferences institute for the maintenance of clergy the 
faithful were used to thinking that priests could be helped by 
offerings but that the state would take care of them 
the development is the latest result of the revised concordat 
or churchstate agreement that took effect in 1985 the accord 
abolished catholicism as the state religion and reduced the 
emphasis on religious instruction in public schools 
the church hierarchy says its glad at the cut off in government 
funding which sometimes made servants of the lord feel more like 
civil servants but it is concerned about how the church will fare 
relying on its often wayward flock 
its a new thing said archbishop camillo ruini 
secretarygeneral of the italian bishops conference nine 
italians out of 10 dont know about it its a long road 
more than 90 percent of italians are catholics but religious 
practice has plunged in recent years as italy has become more 
wealthy and secular only about 25 percent of italians regularly 
attend mass and the church was rebuffed in its efforts to ban 
divorce and abortion in public referendums in 1974 and 1981 
still catholic leaders say the church remains important for 
italians and is respected for its extensive socialservice network 
that aids the handicapped the elderly recovering drug addicts and 
youth 
although many people dont go to church they approve of the 
responsibilities of the church and understand that it must be kept 
up ruini said in an interview 
but the leadership is taking no chances to promote the new 
system catholic authorities have distributed more than 10 million 
flyers in churches and hung up hundreds of posters 
catholic leaders have appealed to accountants to advise their 
clients of taxfree deductions to the church and a special insert 
about the new system was published in italys top business 
newspaper il sole24 ore 
but there is reason for concern 
the church estimates it will need about 280 million a year to 
take care of the 40000 italian priests it hopes most of the money 
will come from offerings to a central fund which are 
taxdeductible up to 1500 starting with returns for 1989 
however the fund will probably raise less than 8 million in 
its first year 
the tax pool pie will be split according to the proportion of 
checkoffs each group gets the catholic church hopes to use its 
share for social services and maintainence of churches in addition 
to paying priests 
italys small jewish community which has been selffinanced 
chose not to receive money from the tax pool and is counting on 
contributions 
marchi admits not all priests are happy about the new system 
like all changes especially for those people of a certain 
age it can cause difficulty unease he said 
priest salaries in the past year which were mostly paid out of 
government funds ranged from 680 to 1240 a month depending on 
expenses responsibility and age 
church officials say contributions have been steadily increasing 
and they are counting on their information campaign but they say 
it is not easy to change a mentality that has existed for centuries 
convincing people to give is especially difficult in southern 
italy where the church used to enjoy a wealth of possessions and 
priests generally lived much better than their parishioners who 
were mostly poor 
people have never been responsible for taking care of their 
own parish said the rev giovanni borrelli who is in charge of 
promoting the new finance system in the naples area 
until the end of the last century if one was doing well or 
had a wellpaying job people would say they had a priest in the 
house it was a way of saying they had a significant source of 
income 
the church in overwhelmingly catholic spain was shocked this 
year to find that only 35 percent of taxpayers had chosen to check 
off the catholic church to receive a tax fund like the one to be 
set up in italy 
italian officials say they expect to do better they point out 
that 96 percent of italian parents made the choice to keep their 
children in religion classes in public schools 
i am not living this in a state of anxiety ruini said in 
italy the church is seen well

a senator on the presidential commission 
investigating air terrorism is accusing federal aviation 
administration officials of covering up knowledge of terrorism 
warnings posted only for government employees 
sen alfonse damato rny lashed out the faa during a 
commission hearing monday saying theyve flunked in protecting 
air passengers 
at the second hearing of the presidents commission on aviation 
security and terrorism damato produced a cable showing the faa 
knew of warnings issued to us embassy employees in moscow prior 
to the dec 21 1988 bombing of pan am flight 103 over lockerbie 
scotland which killed 270 people 
state department and faa officials say posting of the terrorist 
alert in moscow on dec 13 was an error which went against a policy 
of not warning government officials without issuing general public 
warnings of a terrorist threat 
damato one of seven members of the commission looking into the 
flight 103 bombing and air terrorism issues praised embassy 
officials in moscow for posting the warning 
thank god the ambassador published it because he saved some 
lives damato said 
faa security director raymond salazar said it has never been 
shown that any embassy personnel canceled reservations on flight 
103 because of the warning 
you either are incredibly incompetent or you covered up 
damato told salazar who said he could not recall seeing the dec 
13 message from moscow until a copy was sent two months after the 
dec 21 bombing 
the cable acknowledged receipt of an faa advisory of a threat 
against pan am flights between frankfurt and new york which us 
officials later said proved to be a hoax even though the threat fit 
details of the pan am bombing flight 103 began with a different 
plane in frankfurt and was en route from london to new york when it 
blew up 
since a number of people from this post will be flying out of 
frankfurt in the next two weeks the cable said post plans to 
issue an internal administrative notice warning employees of the 
threat no recommendation will be made as to course of action to 
be followed by travelers 
monte belger faa associate administrator said the agency did 
nothing to stop the embassy from warning government employees even 
though such a selective warning is against government policy 
belger told the commission that in retrospect he wishes that 
someone in the faa had focused on the message and called the state 
department to stop the posting of the warning but we didnt 
faa senior intelligence analyst claude manno who acknowledged 
receiving the original message on dec 13 said he probably 
shredded it 
damato said studies by the general accounting office indicate 
that the faa and the present system have flunked when it comes to 
providing basic security systems that anyone can have confidence 
in 
transportation secretary samuel skinner in an interview on 
cable news network denied the assertion saying the faa has 
done a very good job in implementing a number of programs in the 
last year to enhance our protection 
skinner noted a program to install sophisticated bomb detection 
equipment at key airports fines against airlines for security 
lapses and new faa personnel added to foreign posts 
damato said problems with the faa suggest there may be a 
conflict between its role of promoting aviation and that of 
ensuring passenger safety 
the gao report said steppedup security measurers since the 
disaster may be ineffective at highrisk foreign airports due to a 
lack of training standards 
earlier reports found problems with passenger screening airport 
security controls and security inspections

the bush administrations tentative plan to 
seek new excise taxes on some recreational gear and vehicles can be 
defended as a user fee not a new tax because the money would be 
earmarked for a specific purpose sources say 
the revenue from such a tax would be used to pay for 
conservation initiatives administration sources said monday night 
president bush on monday told a group of reporters he expects 
his 1991 budget proposal will let him keep his no new taxes 
pledge for a second year 
sources who sought anonymity told the associated press that some 
officials opposed the idea of a recreational excise tax as a 
violation of the presidents pledge of no new taxes one 
source however argued that these are true user fees 
several sources said the tax could qualify as a user fee because 
it is dedicated to a specific purpose 
quoting an office of management and budget memorandum the 
washington post reported today the tax would range from 1 percent 
to 25 percent on recreational and offroad vehicles camping 
equipment and pleasure boats and would raise 275 million a year 
among the programs to receive funds from the initiative would be 
new purchases of land for national parks and other protected areas 
and for the planting of trees the newspaper said 
one nongovernment source said he expected excise taxes to form 
only part of a shopping list of financing for environmental 
measures from which congress could pick and choose 
that source derek a crandall president of the american 
recreation coalition said weve been assured that any new taxes 
would be proposed only in conjunction with the recreation 
community and in a cooperative venture and that had not been 
done 
an existing excise tax of 10 percent on the import or wholesale 
price of fishing tackle and pleasure boat fuel with revenues going 
to state fish and game departments has worked very well 
crandall said 
weve suggested this model might work in certain other 
cases he said 
sport firearms currently carry an 11 percent excise tax 
the last such tax on vehicles however expired in 1971 a 7 
percent levy on both cars and light trucks 
steven goldstein spokesman for the interior department whose 
national park and fish and wildlife services would spend much of 
the money said monday night we are still working with omb to 
develop our budget for the 1991 fiscal year and it would be 
inappropriate for the department to comment before the president 
submits his budget on jan 22

the key index on the tokyo stock exchange fell 
today after a week of consecutive gains while the dollar inched 
down against the japanese yen 
the dollar ended trading at 14380 yen down 042 yen from 
mondays close of 14422 yen it opened at 14355 yen and ranged 
between 14315 yen and 14397 yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues shed 14708 
points or 038 percent ending at 3848910 it had gained 31514 
points to a recordhigh close of 3858618 the previous day 
dealers attributed the fall in the nikkei to the markets 
speculation that japans central bank may raise its official 
discount rate this week partly to shore up the value of the yen 
against the dollar 
since the market already is reacting to the reports impact of 
the reaction would be minimal if and when the central bank actually 
announces the hike said masahiro umemori an analyst with nomura 
securities co 
we consider todays 14943point decline as small considering 
the negative impact of the rumor he said 
the yomiuri shinbun and the asahi shinbun japans two largest 
newspapers reported that the bank of japan will hike its official 
discount rate by 05 percentage point to 425 percent 
but finance minister ryutaro hashimoto said he had no plans to 
discuss a rate increase with the bank of japan officials today or 
tomorrow at least 
the official discount rate is the rate the central bank charges 
on its loans to commercial banks and often influences other 
interest rates higher interest rates discourage stock investors 
but it makes a countrys currency more attractive to currency 
investors 
a trader with a major japanese commercial bank anonymously said 
the yen is likely to soar against the dollar if the bank of japan 
raise the discount rate

don and kathy blackburn began taking in sick 
and abandoned children while serving as missionaries in haiti and 
came to love them so much theyve brought all 28 home to adopt 
it turned into a family and snowballed blackburn said as 
the couple arrived to a rousing welcome monday night at 
indianapolis international airport the blackburns and their 
children ages 3 to 14 headed for a church camp where theyll 
stay in a dormitory until they find a home 
the arrival of the christian evangelical missionaries and the 
children culminated two years of efforts by christian groups in 
this country to bring the family to the blackburns home state 
the blackburns fled haiti for the neighboring dominican republic 
in 1987 during the turbulence that followed the 1986 ouster of 
dictator jean claude duvalier this month they won special holiday 
parole status from the immigration and naturalization service to 
bring the children to the united states 
this is one of the most fantastic things that ever happened 
a tearful mrs blackburn said at the airport where she and her 
husband were greeted by friends and relatives who hadnt seen them 
since they left for haiti 13 years ago 
dressed in sweaters and brightly colored sneakers the children 
lugged handmade cloth bags containing a change of clothing their 
only other possessions were two dogs and two cats that also made 
the trip 
the children who glimpsed snow for the first time during a 
stop in chicago chased each other through the terminal ate candy 
and examined the equipment of television news crews 
we thought we could sneak through without any notice mrs 
blackburn 42 said we didnt think anybody would care if we had 
28 kids we take it for granted 
the group left by bus for the campground in the town of letts 
30 miles southeast of indianapolis where they will live in a 
dormitory with nine bedrooms and eight bathrooms mrs blackburns 
sister marianne lortz will help care for the brood 
the children were granted humanitarian parole by ins 
commissioner gene mcnary in miami because they were ineligible for 
entry under any other category under immigration law the 
commissioner may allow an otherwise inadmissible alien to enter the 
country temporarily for humanitarian reasons or when such entry is 
considered in the national interest 
after granting parole the ins worked with the state department 
to speed paperwork so the family could be home together by 
christmas mcnary said 
the blackburns with their two sons started a ministry in the 
small mountain village of maissade in 1976 after they had lived 
there about 18 months they began caring for sick or abandoned 
children who were brought to their home 
all but two of the children came to the blackburns as babies 
including the youngest who was just 6 hours old all speak english 
the couple brought the children to this country seeking a more 
stable environment and because they believe it will be easier to 
adopt them here adoption efforts were blocked in haiti and the 
dominican republic because the childrens biological parents are 
dead unknown or untraceable 
the blackburns whose own children are in their 20s and living 
on their own are supported in the venture by churches and 
organizations that have sponsored them for 14 years 
we feel like the lord was guiding and working to bring us 
here said mrs blackburn 
eventually the family will find somewhere other than the church 
camp to live or build a home large enough to accommodate the family 
well homeschool them for now said blackburn 45 
everything is so new to them 
asked how she and her husband managed to keep track of 28 
children mrs blackburn said jesus christ there is no other 
secret jesus has always taken care of us 
planning however is important in managing such a large group 
you just organize a little bit more you dont go off and 
leave them for two or three hours she said nobody babysits 
for crowds like that

police union leaders expressed skepticism and a 
waitandsee stand over the appointment of houston police chief lee 
brown as the citys new police commissioner 
midtown south is bigger than the whole town of houston our 
problems are 20 times bigger lets see what he can do said lt 
james gebhardt head of the lieutenants benevolent association a 
union that represents 1100 lieutenants 
brown 52 has headed a 4000officer department in houston 
since 1982 and gebhardt questioned whether he is prepared to run 
the 26000officer force the nations largest 
the challenges are there its whether he can handle a 
department this big gebhardt said 
mayorelect david dinkins selected brown on monday over four 
other finalists including the current commissioner richard condon 
we need the best police commissioner we could find dinkins 
told reporters of all of the finalists he seemed to be the 
absolute best in the country 
brown will take over jan 22 in a city wracked with drugrelated 
crime the murder rate is at a record level with crack the prime 
cause 
the thing that will hit him immediately is the drugcrime 
problem said thomas reppetto head of the independent watchdog 
citizens crime commission and a member of the search committee that 
interviewed brown 
brown who called his appointment a onceinalifetime 
opportunity has served as public safety chief in houston 
atlanta and portland ore 
small potatoes some said 
atlanta and houston are different from new york city i think 
hes going to find that out very quickly i think hes got a tough 
row to hoe said michael vecchione a former department attorney 
who now sits on the civilian complaint review board 
hes an outoftowner so hell have to learn the city 
system said sgt joe toal head of the sergeants benevolent 
association of 3000 sergeants i guess were in for a lot of 
changes 
brown is the first commissioner from out of town since howard 
leary of philadelphia served from 19661970 vecchione said his 
outsider status wasnt an asset 
police officers do not take well to outsiders its not going 
to be easy for him vecchione said 
why did they have to go outside does this mean that there is 
nobody in the nypd who is qualified asked the rev lawrence 
lucas a black activist who is pastor of the roman catholic church 
of the resurrection in harlem 
condon predicted that browns biggest challenge is definitely 
the budget and the fact that we have a tremendous problem with 
narcotics 
the preliminary estimate is that we are not going to be adding 
to the police department if anything were going to be losing 
police officers i think thats a terrible problem condon said 
vecchione also said brown will have a difficult time figuring 
out new yorks police department it will take time until he 
knows where all the bodies are buried he said

a 1976 regulation barring people from passing 
out leaflets near the white house has been declared 
unconstitutional by a federal judge who says such a ban violates 
the first amendment and has no conceivable governmental 
interest 
us district court judge john pratt ruled monday in the case of 
carol ann fennelly charged with illegally distributing pamphlets 
in june on a street between the white house and treasury department 
the material urged passersby to write members of congress in 
favor of housing for the homeless 
regulations approved in 1970 were part of an effort to protect 
white house security by restrictions on demonstrations the 
provision at issue in fennellys case was added in 1976 to preserve 
an atmosphere of calm and tranquility at memorials and buildings 
associated with past presidents 
pratt noted that fennelly would violate the regulation by 
passing out a leaflet but could convey the same identical 
message by word of mouth without fear of arrest

the tokyo stock exchanges key index ended seven 
days of gains and the dollar edged down against the japanese yen 
today as markets were stirred by rumors of an impending discount 
rate increase 
the dollar ended trading at 14380 yen down 042 yen from 
mondays 14422yen close it opened at 14355 yen and ranged 
between 14315 and 14397 yen 
trading was hectic because of the rumor said minori 
takeuchi a trader with chemical bank in tokyo 
in spot active trading in which an estimated 108 billion 
traded hands japanese investors sold the dollar and the west 
german mark to buy the yen during morning trading in the afternoon 
they bought the currencies back after finance minister ryutaro 
hashimoto denied the reports of an interest rate increase 
hashimoto said the current japanese economic situation did not 
require another discount rate hike because of stable prices but 
that exchange rate levels required watching 
the bank of japan has raised its discount rate twice this year 
to the current 375 percent 
following hashimotos remarks bank of japan official tatsuya 
tamura said in a statement that government interest rate policy was 
a blank slate 
the yomiuri shimbun and the asahi shimbun japans two largest 
newspapers reported today that the bank of japan would hike its 
official discount rate by 05 percentage points to 425 percent by 
this weekend 
ms takeuchi said the governments denial made the market 
players shift their attention from domestic to us monetary 
policy because the market now expects the hike will be postponed 
at least until after february when japanese national elections 
are expected 
the official discount rate is the rate the central bank charges 
on its loans to commercial banks which often influences other 
interest rates higher interest rates make a countrys currency 
more attractive to currency investors but discourages stock 
investors 
on the tokyo stock exchange the 225issue nikkei stock average 
lost 14708 points or 038 percent closing at 3848910 it had 
gained 31514 points to a recordhigh close of 3858618 on monday 
dealers attributed the loss to the discount rate rumors 
until the bank actually raises the rate the market will move 
nervously every time somebody spreads the rumor in the market 
said kazuyuki suzuki a daiwa securities dealer 
since the market already has begun reacting to the rumors the 
impact will be minimal if and when the central bank actually 
announces a hike said masahiro umemori an analyst with nomura 
securities 
we consider todays decline small considering the negative 
impact of the rumor he said 
volume on the markets first section was an estimated 900 
million shares up from mondays 850 million shares

an obstetrician was convicted of 
seconddegree murder for the deaths of eight infants during bungled 
highrisk deliveries he performed in his office rather than in 
hospitals 
jurors deliberated 19 days before returning the verdict against 
dr milos klvana 47 who prosecutors accused of continuing his 
practice even though he knew he wasnt qualified to handle risky 
births 
klvana was convicted monday of nine counts of seconddegree 
murder and of 43 other felonies including insurance fraud grand 
theft perjury conspiracy and practicing medicine without a 
license 
klvana a resident of suburban santa clarita could be sentenced 
to 15 years to life in prison on the seconddegree murder charges 
sentencing was set for jan 12 
midway through the return of the verdicts in superior court 
klvana jumped to his feet and told judge judith chirlin i want 
to be excused 
he was allowed to leave the courtroom but returned after all 
the verdicts were read he asked the judge for a new trial and said 
he would represent himself 
prosecutors said klvana bungled deliveries in his valencia and 
temple city medical offices between 1982 and 1986 causing one 
stillbirth and the deaths of eight infants shortly after birth 
klvana who was convicted in 1978 on 26 counts of illegally 
prescribing drugs was arrested in october 1986 following a 
twoyear investigation of the childbirth deaths 
prosecutors said the czechoslovakianborn physician lacked the 
training to deliver the babies but knew enough to realize the 
mothers should have been taken to the hospital 
there was no question that the man knew what he was doing was 
dangerous deputy district attorney brian r kelberg said he 
did it for reasons that were selfish rather than in the best 
interest of his patients hes not just incompetent but he knows 
hes incompetent 
among the women whose babies died the prosecution said were an 
insulin dependent diabetic and two women who had rh factor blood 
types making their pregnancies risky even in hospitals 
klvana contended he was singled out because of his unorthodox 
birthing practices including outofhospital deliveries and the use 
of a laborinducing drug that prosecutors said should only be 
administered in hospitals 
the prosecutor never contended that klvana intended to kill the 
babies but he argued that the doctor knew that deaths or 
stillbirths could result from his recommendations against 
hospitalizing the mothers 
klvanas attorneys conceded that he was negligent but argued 
there was no basis for a murder conviction saying the doctor did 
not understand his own incompetence 
early in the trial klvanas codefendant dolores doyle 36 an 
unlicensed midwife unexpectedly pleaded guilty to involuntary 
manslaughter and insurance fraud in a plea bargain she was 
released on probation having already served two years in prison 
klvana has spent all but three months in jail since his 1986 
arrest his 200000 bail was revoked when it was learned he had 
applied for a new certification to prescribe drugs and was 
dispensing oral contraceptives

an expert on the mediterranean fruit fly has 
developed a poison bait for the cropdestroying pest that he says 
might enable california to end aerial spraying in a few years 
roy t cunningham a us department of agriculture entomologist 
based in hilo said monday he plans to begin tests early next year 
on a compound thats a mix of a new longlasting chemical 
attractant and pesticide it is designed to be sprayed on trees and 
utility poles 
the bait called ceralure is mixed with malathion the same 
pesticide california authorities have in recent weeks been spraying 
from helicopters over wide stretches of the los angeles suburbs to 
control a medfly outbreak 
though scientists insist the pesticide is safe in the minute 
quantities used spraying is the focus of emotional debate in 
california where the flies threaten a 16 billion farm industry 
residents and some environmental groups oppose each new round of 
spraying as unsafe while farmers and government agriculture 
experts insist its necessary and harmless 
california officials have spent 10 million battling 13 
outbreaks this year a 198082 infestation cost california 
taxpayers 100 million for eradication and cost growers about 100 
million in lost sales 
the medfly one of the most damaging fruit flies attacks more 
than 250 fruits and vegetables most of the damage is done when 
females deposit their eggs in crops making them unmarketable 
medflies get into california as eggs or larvae in fruit and 
produce usually illegally imported or mailed from hawaii or 
central america 
the ceralure gel is a much simpler and a much less costly 
system than we presently have said cunningham who chairs a 
committee that advises california officials on fighting medfly 
outbreaks 
it could eventually replace aerial spraying but it will take 
two to three years of testing to determine if the substance is an 
effective and safe option cunningham said 
californias department of food and agriculture has agreed to 
help fund the study of ceralures effectiveness providing 83600 
during the next three years said isi a siddiqui the agencys 
assistant director 
blobs of the ceralure gel shot from trucks onto trees and 
utility poles would attract male medflies whihch would be killed 
by the pesticide cunningham said 
the key to the new system is that ceralure appears to stay 
effective for two weeks if that proves the case it may be 
costeffective to use the substance to fight fly outbreaks in 
california reapplying the ceralure every two weeks cunningham 
said 
the gel technique has already been used in california to fight 
the medflys cousin the oriental fruit fly 
cunningham said researchers dont understand how ceralure 
attracts the male medflies

the city that draws its name and history 
from the westernmost locks of the erie canal plans a party tonight 
for a public works project the replacement of the lock gates that 
were installed 72 years ago 
lockport residents plan to celebrate with light and song even 
though the days have long since passed when lockports locks were 
the citys lifeblood 
its probably the most significant thing to happen to the 
community certainly the most significant investment in the 
canal said mary brennantaylor chairwoman of the canal 
spotlight committee 
the locks she said bring tourists and give the community a 
sense of identity 
lockports two locks carry the canal up over the niagara 
escarpment on the final leg of its route from albany to buffalo 
the town was founded four years after the canal opened in 1825 and 
grew to become a city in 1865 
there were hotels stores bars businesses along the canal 
there were grocery stores right down the lock said assistant 
city historian howard colbey mills used the spillway of the 
locks for power 
john bloom a 73yearold resident who worked on canal boats in 
the 1930s and 1940s said his barges used to stop for groceries in 
lockport make deliveries to businesses along the canal and haul in 
building stone from nearby quarries 
there was one barge right after another 24 hours a day 
he said 
the present gates were installed in 1917 when the entire canal 
was rebuilt and widened but the canals usefulness as a shipping 
route ended when the st lawrence seaway opened in the 1950s and 
many of the flour paper and textile mills along the canal went out 
of business lockports major employer today is the harrison 
radiator division of general motors 
the canal is now used mainly by pleasure boats but interest in 
the locks has been rising in the past few years on summer days 
lock workers say the walls and bridges overlooking the lock are 
frequently jammed with sightseers 
the attention paid to the 23 million lock replacement has 
nevertheless surprised many of those working on the project 
the local paper comes out every day and takes pictures said 
earl kostuk job superintendent for scc contracting of niagara 
falls which is performing the work under state supervision 
the plans for tonights celebration call for 300 residents 
holding red glowsticks to line the walls of the lock singing 
christmas carols and the traditional erie canal folk song low 
bridge everybody down as all of lockports churches peal their 
bells in unison mrs brennantaylor said 
downtown stores will stay open late like they did when the 
canal was an important shipping artery 
further festivities are planned for may when the project is 
finished and the canal opens again for navigation 
bloom who tells fourthgraders about life on the barges as part 
of the local history curriculum said he was pleased by the plans 
i think its wonderful they need it he said they should 
never close the canal down

columnist art buchwald testified in his 
breachofcontract lawsuit that he based the script idea for the 
smash movie coming to america on a real african king who drove 
a studebaker 
but entertainer arsenio hall told the court he and comedian 
eddie murphy brainstormed the 1988 movie 
buchwald was to return to the stand today after beginning his 
testimony monday in his 5 million lawsuit against paramount 
pictures which optioned the columnists screenplay king for a 
day in 1984 
buchwald told superior court judge harvey schneider that he 
wrote his script idea originally titled its a crude crude 
world based on a data bank of experiences he keeps in his 
head 
the king he said may have been based on a watusi king he 
interviewed in africa in the 1950s he was a real king and he 
drove a studebaker he recalled 
soon after he wrote the script idea buchwald said producer and 
coplaintiff alain bernheim sold the option to paramount and the 
writer received 17500 less 10 per cent to my agent 
the pulitzer prizewinning columnist and author said 
negotiations began for louis malle to direct and then he heard 
that murphy would star i was delighted he said 
buchwald contends that paramount reneged on the production deal 
and used his idea for the film that amassed 300 million in box 
office earnings 
hall the latenight tv talkshow host who costarred in 
coming to america said he never saw a script idea entitled 
king for a day 
both stories tell the tale of an african prince who comes to the 
united states falls in love and takes home a bride 
i think a lot of stories have been written about african 
princes hall told reporters outside court im offended 
because eddie is a very bright man im a bright guy why do we 
have to seek a stolen concept its insulting 
buchwald 64 said he was sorry hall felt insulted 
i like arsenio hes a nice fellow he said this is 
between paramount and me 
paramount chairman frank mancuso described murphys rich 
contract with the studio which gives him 8 million a picture plus 
15 per cent of gross profits and he indicated murphy wants more 
like a good baseball player were always negotiating with 
him mancuso said hes a very important star 
hall said he and murphy set out in 1987 to create the first 
black fairy tale he said they were intent on improving the image 
of blacks as well as murphys own screen image 
there had never been a black fairy tale hall said we 
wanted to create like a fairy tale beautiful like the prince 
got the girl we wanted a fairy tale everyone could relate to 
hall said he and murphy wanted to shape the screenplay 
themselves because otherwise it would just be another black 
story written by white people

redoubt volcanos frequent eruptions 
pumped tons of steam and ash into the air covering parts of 
southcentral alaska with a fine layer of gray grit and stranding 
holiday mail and travelers 
variable winds spread ash clouds east north and south but 
anchorage with almost half the states population was spared the 
fallout the heaviest ash concentrations were seen over the kenai 
peninsula and prince william sound 
ash clouds were seen rising to 31000 feet from redoubts 
10197foot summit 
the volcano is still very active said steve brantley a 
geologist with the alaska volcano observatory on monday we are 
continuing to observe a high level of earthquake activity on the 
mountain 
the swirling clouds of ash delayed or detoured air traffic in 
and out of anchorage stacking up thousands of travelers and tons 
of mail 
the anchorage international airport was open monday but service 
was irregular with some airlines grounding aircraft and others 
offering limited service some domestic airlines canceled flights 
and international carriers routed their aircraft around anchorage 
at the seattletacoma international airport hundreds of people 
trying to get to alaska were stranded 
i guess my wife and i will be sleeping at the airport said 
anchorage resident john stout 67 on monday the couple has been 
stuck in seattle since saturday they learned monday that delta air 
lines would no longer pay for their hotel room 
we cant go on indefinitely supplying people all over the 
country with hotels and meals delta spokesman ron tansey said 
were fairly optimistic we can get these people home 
nancy schmitt a spokeswoman for the us postal service said 
the ash clouds were playing havoc with us this is the 
largest backup weve ever had 
about 22000 pounds of mail was stacked in anchorage on monday 
for shipment out of alaska another 130000 pounds waited in 
seattle for shipment to alaska she said 
the postal service depends on commercial jets to move the mail 
but has resorted to chartering propeller aircraft she said 
the mails moving but slowly she said 
the alaska railroad added a train between anchorage and 
fairbanks for travelers said spokeswoman vivian hamilton 
while some were trying to get on planes a group of korean air 
line passengers refused to reboard their flight monday saying they 
were concerned whether it was safe to fly 
flight 25 was en route from new york to seoul on saturday when 
it landed in anchorage the flight was delayed and passengers were 
taken to hotels 
then all these rumors started about the safety of the plane 
the volcanic ash said christine lee a korean national with a 
home in the united states its hard to tell whats really true 
redoubt rumbled awake thursday after two decades of slumber it 
has sent ash and steam skyward intermittently since it is located 
in a sparsely populated area 115 miles southwest of anchorage in 
the lake clark national park and preserve 
last friday dust from redoubt shut down all four engines of a 
klm royal dutch airlines 747 causing the plane to plunge from 
25000 feet to 12000 feet in 12 minutes before the crew could 
restart the clogged engines

what you do and the second is to just do good work regardless of 
the size of the audience

when new york investors quietly bought most of 
the pike place market in the early 1980s the deal was seen as a 
boon for the popular complex that many call the soul of seattle 
the sale provided 3 million to finish more than a decade of 
renovation repair and refurbishing and was central to the 
renaissance of the surrounding area that went from down and out to 
up and in 
but the manhattanbased urban groups recent demands for a 
better return on their investment have upset market managers and 
sparked concern from residents that the nature of their cherished 
institution would change 
the partially openair market which opened in 1907 as a way for 
farmers to sell directly to consumers sits on a bluff overlooking 
puget sound its a chaotic mix fishmongers hawk salmon 
craftspeople display handknit sweaters parents drop off their 
children at a daycare center and tourists are everywhere 
about 15 million visitors go to the market each year 
urban group vice presidents arthur b malman and martin major 
say they dont want to change the markets special character to get 
a better profit but others say profits may only come with major 
change 
malman said a 10 percent return on investment would be about 
right for recent years he said investors have gotten just 3000 
urban group manages historic properties around the nation from 
the initial 3 million payment malman said investors have gained 
10 million in tax writeoffs but he added we dont keep score 
with tax benefits we keep score with profits 
he has accused the markets landlord and manager pike place 
market preservation and development authority of inefficiency and 
of saddling the 30 ownerinvestors with costs they should not have 
to bear 
the dispute over operating costs goes to arbitration this week 
each side has named a property management expert to review figures 
and legal documents if the experts fail to reach agreement they 
are to name a third to resolve the issue both sides hope for a 
settlement within the next few weeks 
the fight already is costly so far urban group has spent about 
200000 for an audit by arthur anderson amp co of the management 
the authority has spent about the same in legal fees 
merchants feel caught in the middle of the battle many fear big 
rent increases which may force some to move or close their doors 
while a few have joined urban in criticizing market management 
i think theres a pretty good consensus in favor of the 
authority said paul dunn executive director of the pike place 
market merchants association 
the issue drew about 250 people last week to an emotional market 
community meeting that lasted more than three hours several 
suggested buying back the market a prospect rejected by malman and 
major 
market businesses 114 farmers 230 artists and craftspeople 
and 225 commercial tenants including a daycare center parrot 
store winery legal and dental offices and the citys lone kosher 
cafe have gross annual receipts of about 50 million said 
michael carroll director of the market authority 
he said operating profits are unlikely because of his agencys 
mission providing social services such as a clinic for seniors 
serving as an incubator of small business and giving food and 
farmers top priority and restrictions such as a historic review 
commissions veto power over many tenants 
carroll also said the push for profits is the biggest threat to 
the market since voters defeated a plan in 1971 that would have 
razed most of the buildings for a hotel and convention center 
urban group meanwhile is trying to assure merchants and 
residents that their demand for more profits wont force a major 
turnover in tenants 
i think its unrealistic to assume that the merchants could 
pay much higher rents malman said 
i like the tenants who are now in the market major said 
i dont want to change that mix in any way

subway gunman bernhard goetz reportedly is being 
treated for cancer 
goetz who became a symbol of crime fears in the city when he 
shot four unarmed youths he said were threatening him on a subway 
train revealed in court papers monday he underwent major 
surgery last month 
the surgery and subsequent radiation treatments were for 
testicular cancer sources familiar with the case told the new york 
daily news and the new york post one testicle was removed the 
newspapers reported today 
goetzs attorney barry slotnick refused to give details of his 
clients illness 
obviously you can assume that he is not well slotnick 
said but added that goetz was in good spirits after the operation 
he is a very strong individual who has gone through a lot in 
the past five years and will not allow his present unfortunate 
physical condition to get him down the attorney said 
the shootings dec 22 1984 ignited controversy over racial 
tension and the rights of crime victims to defend themselves 
goetz who is white claimed the four black youths were trying 
to rob him the youths said they were panhandling 
goetz 41 served eight months in prison for a weapons 
conviction stemming from the shootings he was acquitted of 
attempted murder and assault 
darrell cabey who is paralyzed from the waist down from the 
shooting is suing goetz for 50 million 
the documents revealing goetzs surgery were filed in court in 
the bronx to explain why he failed to appear for a deposition dec 
1 with cabeys attorneys 
william kunstler one of cabeys attorneys said the news goetz 
had cancer didnt make him feel sympathy 
it possibly makes me believe in god kunstler said

a chicago suburb has agreed to pay 650000 to 
the former owner of an apartment complex who contended he was 
forced out of business for renting to too many blacks 
george cadar of chicago charged in a lawsuit that the us 
department of housing and urban development had foreclosed on his 
complex in 1985 after earl bell then president of the village of 
university park wrote letters saying the unit was poorly managed 
and rife with gang activity 
witnesses during the federal trial said cadar had been singled 
out because bell believed he rented to too many blacks and because 
cadar was bells political rival 
testimony showed that no gang member had ever been arrested on 
the apartment grounds and that the complex was wellmaintained 
said matthew piers cadars attorney 
the jury friday decided that cadars civil rights had been 
violated and that bell had caused hud to foreclose on the 437unit 
complex and it awarded cadar 13 million 
but under a settlement reached before the verdict was announced 
he agreed to accept no more than 650000 if the village promised 
not to appeal 
bell president of the village of 6300 from 1983 to 1985 said 
monday that hud was justified in taking over the complex in 1985 
because it was 10 million in debt

john paul stevens the justice in a bow tie 
marches to his own drummer and appears not to care whether anyone 
follows 
isolation often is the price he pays for intellectual 
creativity a supreme court leadership role that he has shunned 
willingly since joining the court 14 years ago today 
for all his years on the nations highest court lawyers legal 
scholars and court watchers have used the same words to describe 
stevens maverick wild card even intellectual gadfly 
they also have used words such as brilliance and 
integrity 
he hasnt been a highimpact player said lawrence marshall 
a northwestern university law professor and former stevens law 
clerk 
that which makes a leader on the court is not necessarily 
intellectual acumen or integrity but an ability to engage in 
politics with a small p a willingness to compromise and build a 
consensus marshall said justice stevens has always considered 
his role to be judicial not political 
james simon dean of the new york law school called stevens 
the most independently minded and intellectually creative member 
of the court and a man of great integrity 
the benefit is that he always offers a fresh perspective 
simon said but a downside perhaps is that he doesnt have much 
of a following 
while the courts eight other members may disagree over how to 
decide an issue it is not rare for stevens to file a concurring or 
dissenting opinion that says another issue is whats really at the 
heart of the matter 
in the ascent of pragmatism a new book on the court during 
retired chief justice warren e burgers 17year tenure new york 
university law school professor bernard schwartz makes the same 
point 
the book calls stevens a loner who makes little effort to 
win over other members of the court 
a pleasant unassuming man with an affinity for wearing bow 
ties stevens will turn 70 in april he has found comfort in his 
work and in the relative anonymity it provides he refused to be 
interviewed for this article but answered several questions 
submitted in writing 
he said he enjoys a regular game of bridge hes a life master 
and early morning tennis matches and has not yet closed out his 
avocation of flying as a licensed private pilot 
stevens high court tenure began dec 19 1975 after his 
nomination by president gerald r ford breezed through senate 
confirmation he already had distinguished himself as a judge of 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals in chicago after being 
appointed to that job by president richard m nixon in 1970 
when in 1978 the supreme court ruled that the federal 
communications commission could ban the broadcast of indecent 
words even if they are not legally obscene stevens wrote for the 
court 
we simply hold that when the commission finds that a pig has 
entered the parlor the exercise of its regulatory power does not 
depend on proof the pig is obscene 
through the 1980s stevens served as something of a 
selfappointed inhouse critic 
his opinions occasionally chastised the court for deciding 
certain cases more broadly than necessary what he has called an 
indefensible brand of judicial activism 
judges who have confidence in their own ability to fashion 
public policy are less hesitant to change the law than those of us 
who are inclined to give wide latitude to the views of the voters 
representatives on nonconstitutional matters stevens wrote in 
dissenting from a securities law decision last may 
dissenting from a 1984 decision that reinstated a criminal 
conviction stevens said the court must be ever mindful of its 
primary role as the protector of the citizen and not the warden or 
the prosecution 
he said the court was spending too much time secondguessing 
state court rulings that resulted in victories for individual 
defendants 
in most criminal law disputes and in other highprofile issues 
abortion civil rights and churchstate relations stevens can be 
found voting with the courts liberal wing 
but when president reagans nomination of robert h bork to the 
court was foundering in 1987 stevens took the unusual and 
unexpected step of speaking out in favor of bork 
surely he knew that once on the court bork would not vote his 
way in most cases law professor marshall said but justice 
stevens in his own apolitical way saw no reason to keep bork off 
the court 
similarly he repeatedly is the voice of conscience on how the 
court wields its power marshall said that flows from a strong 
belief in the integrity of the court

lithuanian communists today opened a 
congress aimed at breaking off from the soviet communist party and 
declaring themselves an independent organization that will compete 
in a multiparty system 
earlier this month lithuania become the first soviet republic 
to delete from its constitution the article enshrining the leading 
role of the communist party 
lithuanian party leader algirdas brazauskas opened todays 
meeting of more than 1000 delegates declaring that only by 
joint efforrts can we justify the peoples trust 
outside several hundred lithuanians gathered on the steps of 
the opera and ballet theater where the congress was being held 
they carried red green and yellow lithuanian flags and banners 
backing the partys proposed split 
a small group of demonstrators marched down gediminas avenue 
the main street to protest against even a reformed communist 
party one sign proclaimed stop communism in lithuania with 
the word communism painted red to simulate dripping blood 
the congress is to last most of the week and observers expect a 
vote on the partys status to take place wednesday or thursday 
one lithuanian observer romas gudaitis wrote in todays 
edition of the youth newspaper komsomolskaya pravda that 
lithuania right now is like a volcano 
he said the political tension has reached its culmination 
a draft declaration on the lithuanian communist partys status 
proclaims it to be part of the world communist movement but says 
nothing about its relationship with the soviet communist party 
lithuanian communist party leaders on dec 7 led the republics 
parliament in striking article 6 of the lithuanian constitution 
which had declared the communist party to be the leading force 
in lithuanian society 
parliament directed that legislation be prepared to allow for 
the registration of other political parties a move toward 
developing in lithuania what lawmakers in moscow have refused to 
allow countrywide 
the lithuanian communist leaders say they need to reform the 
party and break its formal monopoly on power if they are to have 
any chance of success in local elections which are scheduled for 
feb 24 
the lithuanian communist party has lost 10000 members or about 
5 percent of its membership this year according to party 
statistics 
soviet communist politburo member vadim a medvedev was sent to 
vilnius three weeks ago with a message from president mikhail s 
gorbachev urging the lithuanian communists not to break from the 
soviet party 
it must not be allowed it is inadmissable now to follow the 
path of splitting communists on the basis of national or social 
background gorbachev who is also communist party leader said 
in the message delivered by medvedev 
lithuanian communist leaders were summoned to moscow in 
midnovember for a meeting with soviet partys ruling politburo on 
the question of splitting from the soviet communist party

a judge has dismissed charges against 
a 75yearold antitax crusader accused of plotting earlier this 
year to kill thenmayor henry cisneros ruling the defendant had 
been entrapped 
parker abell 75 had been charged with solicitation of capital 
murder accused of offering a district attorneys investigator 
5000 in may for cisneros slaying cisneros did not seek 
reelection and left office in june 
defense attorney steve hilbig argued that it was investigator 
john veltkamp not abell who was doing the persuading during their 
videotaped meeting in may and district judge mike machado agreed 
monday that abell was entrapped 
its an early christmas present for mr abell said hilbig 
a former assistant us attorney seeking the republican nomination 
for district attorney 
thats what they should have done abell told his lawyer and 
the judge 
assistant district attorney julian lopez said the law on 
entrapment is broad and that there was room for other 
interpretations but he doubted prosecutors would pursue the case 
against the cancerstricken abell a retired railroad employee from 
natalia 
i imagine that would be a factor in whether we appeal lopez 
said hes old hes very sick 
abell who officials said had not paid taxes for 10 years is a 
onetime libertarian candidate for congress 
hilbig said he believes the investigation of abell was initiated 
by the internal revenue service in 1988 after abell called into a 
radio talk show to complain about rising taxes 
according to testimony the irs paid an informant 1000 in 
advance to develop information on abell

gunfire was reported early today in the 
streets of a western romanian city where witnesses say security 
forces have shot and killed dozens of people in antigovernment 
rioting that began over the weekend 
unconfirmed reports have put the death toll at up to 400 and one 
witness was quoted as saying he saw helicopters fire on crowds in 
the city of timisoara 
romania has virtually sealed its borders in an apparent attempt 
to prevent details from emerging of the unrest which a hungarian 
newspaper said had spread to two other transylvanian cities arad 
and brasov 
the unrest is the most serious since november 1987 in the 
country whose leaders have refused to stray from orthodox communism 
statecontrolled romanian media have made no mention of the 
unrest and western reporters have been prevented from entering the 
country most reports have come from travelers leaving romania or 
from news agencies able to reach residents by telephone 
in timisoara beginning on saturday thousands of people have 
violently vented rage at hardline president nicolae ceausescu for 
his intolerance and the hardships he has forced romanians to endure 
greek dental students who had been attending school in the 
city said late monday after crossing into yugoslavia that they had 
seen soldiers shoot indiscriminately at protesters killing 
dozens 
the students said they heard protesters shout freedom 
down with ceausescu and bread 
a western resident of timisoara who crossed into yugoslavia told 
the associated press that the extent of the weekend violence was 
horrifying and that he saw several corpses on the streets 
tiananmen is nothing compared to timisoara he said 
speaking on condition he not be further identified at least 500 
people were killed in june when chinese troops crushed the 
prodemocracy movement in beijing 
budapest radio said a caller from timisoara 30 miles from the 
hungarian and yugoslav borders this morning reported renewed 
gunfire but that the phone then went dead 
the radio quoted a hungarian who said he had several physician 
relatives working in timisoara hospitals he said he talked to them 
by telephone and estimated from their reports that between 300 and 
400 people were killed in the city by troops with 250 bodies taken 
to one hospital 
about 20 percent of the dead and wounded were ethnic hungarians 
others ethnic romanians he told the radio 
that would substantiate other accounts trickling out of the 
country that the protest grew from a few hundred ethnic hungarians 
defending a local pastor into a massive demonstration against 
ceausescus harsh policies 
romanias crackdown drew protest from other countries including 
hungary which has long been at odds with bucharest over the 
treatment of the 17 million ethnic hungarian minority in romania 
most of whom live in transylvania 
a yugoslav who said he traveled to timisoara saturday night was 
quoted as telling the belgrade daily politika that crowds in the 
city were fired on from helicopters 
i was stopped at approach to timisoara by soldiers holding 
guns at pointblank range but they let me through radoslav 
dencic was quoted by the daily as saying 
the same night bursts of automatic weapon fire could be 
heard he said crowds were even shot at from helicopters 
a yugoslav trucker frank zemberi said he passed through 
timisoara early tuesday and saw two large fires raging in distant 
parts of town 
countless tanks were parked on the outskirts of timisoara 
zemberi said but the city itself appeared calm with five armored 
vehicles parked in the center and a number of police vans cruising 
the streets 
a yugoslav traveler said monday he saw two people killed in 
timisoara traffic into romania was virtually halted on the 
yugoslav hungarian and bulgarian borders and austrians and west 
germans were informed that with few exceptions they were not 
allowed to enter 
the yugoslav news agency tanjug said monda that security forces 
had taken full control in timisoara romanias fourthlargest city 
with 350000 residents 
hungarys radio kossuth quoted an unnamed resident of the city 
as saying things were calm during the day but at night its like 
during the war 
all main intersections have roadblocks everybody is stopped 
and checked and people are not allowed to leave town except in 
extreme cases the radio quoted the resident as saying 
the hungarian daily magyar hirlap today quoted unidentified 
truck drivers as saying arad some 60 miles north of timisoara 
is ringed with tanks and traffic is detoured it asserted 
without any specifics that there were also clashes in arad and 
brasov 
col janos pal of the hungarian border guards was quoted as 
saying crowds in curtic between arad and timisoara broke into 
local communist party headquarters on sunday and burned documents 
in a broadcast monday on west germanys radio bremen william 
toetoek an ethnic german writer from romania quoted witnesses in 
timisoara as saying between 300 and 400 demonstrators were killed 
in the unrest 
the bloody clashes were a sign of contempt for ceausescu who 
has ruled romania since 1965 stifling dissent with a vast secret 
police force and stubbornly resisting reform 
while other east bloc countries end or relax oneparty communist 
rule ceausescus government has maintained strict control of 
society and the economy and continues to harass and jail its 
critics 
ceausescus crash industrialization programs and drive to repay 
the countrys entire 11 billion foreign debt have caused 
widespread shortages and rationing of basic foods 
the unrest was the most serious since a protest march by 10000 
workers in brasov in november 1987 ceausescu did not comment on it 
and on monday traveled to iran for a state visit his his wife 
elena the second most powerful person in the country stayed 
behind 
the unrest apparently began after hundreds of members of the 
countrys ethnic hungarian minority formed a human chain friday 
to prevent the attempted eviction of the rev laszlo toekes who 
has championed their rights said mihnea berindei vice chairman of 
the parisbased romanian league for human rights 
the protestant clergyman harassed for months by authorities for 
defending ethnic hungarians against alleged official 
discrimination took refuge with his wife in his church on nov 2 
after masked assailants tried to attack him berindei said he said 
toekes whereabouts were not known monday evening

prime minister mudar badran told the new 
parliament today his government will lift martial law which for 22 
years has banned large public meetings and allowed authorities to 
restrict freedom of speech 
badran seeking a vote of confidence from the newly elected 
legislature added that until martial law is formally revoked most 
of its provisions will be frozen effective immediately 
he also vowed his administration will crack down on corruption 
by public officials and criticized former governments for deficit 
spending that swelled jordans 83 billion foreign debt 
under martial law which king hussein imposed after the 1967 
arabisraeli war authorities also can close newspapers at any 
time effectively inhibiting free criticism of officials it also 
provides for special courts 
most candidates in last months general elections called for the 
lifting of martial law and many demanded the legalization of 
political parties which currently are banned 
badran said a constitutional court will be formed to secure 
citizens rights as stipulated by the constitution 
he lifted legal immunity from government officials and said he 
would put forward legislation requiring an officeholder to present 
a comprehensive and documented report of all his possessions 
the announcement of such a financial disclosure requirement was 
aimed at ensuring the integrity of public officials 
the government of prime minister zeid rifai which resigned 
earlier this year after bloody rioting was widely accused of 
corruption 
the largest bloc in the new lower house is made up of islamic 
fundamentalists or their sympathizers 
i announce in this parliament that martial law is now 
considered frozen until such laws are constitutionally 
abolished in the near future badran told the lower house of 
parliament 
it was the latest in a series of moves towards democracy and 
liberalization announced by the king and by badrans government 
which was formed dec 6 
the lower house has to approve all laws and has the power to 
throw out prime ministers and their cabinets still king hussein 
can block any laws in the royally appointed senate or through a 
veto and he has frequently used the power to dissolve parliament 
and rule by decree 
last month hussein promised a gradual reduction in the 
activities of the martial law courts and said their 
responsibilities would be transfered to civil courts 
on dec 10 badran announced his government would return 
confiscated passports and promised further amnesties for political 
prisoners after 48 were released by the previous government 
he told parliament then that he ordered authorities to give all 
jordanian citizens freedom of movement and the right to work in 
accordance with the kings instructions 
badran said he did not know how many passports had been 
confiscated but security sources said the number was more than 
8700 many of those whose passports were confiscated had said 
security officials intervened to bar them from jobs 
the november elections were the first nationwide poll since 1967 
when israel captured the west bank from jordan hussein last year 
renounced jordans claim to the west bank in favor of the palestine 
liberation organization 
the fundamentalist moslem brotherhood movement captured the most 
seats in the lower house of parliament 25 out of a total of 80 
but badran earlier this month formed a government without the 
movement that advocates stricter islamic laws 
by law the new 23member cabinet has to appear before lower 
house for a vote of confidence within 30 days if approved by a 
simple majority of 41 votes the government will be installed if 
not king hussein will have to name a new prime minister

the communist premier today urged 
the communistdominated parliament to elect opposition leader 
vaclav havel for president by the end of the year 
it is the governments opinion that there is no alternative 
than to elect vaclav havel as president premier marian calfa 
told deputies in the federal assembly they applauded the 
recommendation 
thousands of students gathered early today around the statue of 
st wenceslas with banners balloons and red white and blue 
czechoslovak flags for prohavel demonstrations some students who 
arrived early on trains and buses from throughout the country 
passed the time before the demonstrations by christmas shopping 
along wenceslas square 
calfas recommendation and its reception by the deputies 
appeared to signal the final victory of the peaceful revolution 
which in one month has swept away 41 years of communist domination 
of czechoslovakias government 
the prodemocracy opposition has negotiated a new noncommunist 
government that includes two former dissidents ousted hardline 
communist president gustav husak and introduced reforms in every 
political social and religious sphere 
support has been snowballing for havel who would be the first 
noncommunist to hold the office in 41 years husak resigned dec 
10 
havels only rivals are former communist premier ladislav adamec 
and alexander dubcek who led the reforms of the prague spring 
in 1968 and was removed by the kremlin dubcek who enjoys 
tremendous support in his native slovakia has been waffling on 
whether he is in the race 
cestmir cisar the students candidate for president in 1968 and 
an unofficial contender in the current race withdrew monday night 
and threw his support behind havel 
czechoslovakias constitution requires parliament to elect a new 
president within two weeks of a vacancy occurring but communist 
and opposition leaders agreed to introduce a resolution to extend 
the deadline 
the twopoint agenda approved at the start of todays meeting 
would give them until late january to choose a president it was 
unclear when a vote on the extension would be taken 
calfa said a president should be chosen before the year ends in 
12 days 
the government is making efforts to solve the political and 
constitutional crisis calfa said we want to ask the federal 
assembly to contribute to this effort by electing the president by 
the end of this year 
josef bartoncik head of the lower house of the bicameral 
parliament and leader of the peoples party said his party would 
support havel and would recommend that parliament recovene dec 28 
or dec 29 to elect the president 
the socialist party one of four small parties in the 
communistdominated parliament also endorsed havel 
deputies also were considering the governments reform program 
which outlines political and economic changes repudiates the 
repression that followed the 1968 antireform crackdown and 
supports a democratic socialism 
meanwhile opposition leaders said reports of a planned military 
coup were spread to cause uncertainty opposition member sasha 
vondra was quoted as saying in the svobodne slovo daily that the 
rumor of an impending coup is purposefully propagated 
disinformation and rumor 
representatives from the civic forum met monday with defense 
minister miroslav vacek who assured them the army supported 
democratic reform he said 
col stanislav pohoral a defense ministry spokesman condemned 
the circulation of leaflets mainly in brno which say a 
military coup is being planned calling it totally 
irresponsible 
the army leadership distances itself from these actions and 
rejects the accusations he said

wood floors burned a converted 126yearold mill complex today in 
the biggest blaze in providence history officials said three 
firefighters suffered minor injuries

parliament put the government through its first 
noconfidence vote today over an economic reform plan that retains 
heavy central planning but premier nikolai i ryzhkov and his 
ministers easily survived 
in the dramatic confrontation the normally sophisticated 
ryzhkovs voice cracked with emotion as he pleaded for support 
progressives have criticized his economic package as inadequate to 
the task of ending a grave economic crisis 
they say it doesnt go far enough to overhaul a plodding 
bureaucractic system and encourage greater productivity and 
efficiency by embracing free market mechanisms 
the congress should not avoid making an evaluation it must 
express its firm position either to support the governments 
proposals of course considering the remarks made here or some 
other formulation ryzhkov told the 2250 members of the congress 
of peoples deputies the soviet parliament 
after his appeal the noconfidence motion was rejected by tally 
of 1685 to 199 with 99 abstentions the ruling communists hold 87 
percent of the chambers seats 
yuri andreev a parliamentarian from moscow proposed the 
noconfidence vote after a heated debate in which progressives 
attacked the government plan as inadequate to the task of effective 
reform 
ryzhkovs plan shifts traditional central planning from an 
emphasis on heavy industry to consumer goods it speaks of 
developing a market but says little about concrete measures for 
freeing products from the iron control of ministries for free sale 
on the market 
andreev urged parliament to express its lack of confidence in 
the government by asking it to draft a new economic reform plan and 
to fire the officials who drafted the original version 
just before the vote ryzhkov took the floor and in an emotional 
statement with a cracking voice rejected a proposal that the plan 
merely be taken into consideration and asked for a straight yes or 
no vote 
president mikhail s gorbachev who was presiding over the 
session agreed that parliament should take a firm decision but 
he added that congressional committees would consider changes in 
the plan suggested by the deputies 
its a political question will we support this government 
that which it introduced or will we keep the government in such a 
state all the time that it cannot start its work gorbachev asked 
the vote on approving the economic plan was 1532 to 419 with 
44 abstensions ryzhkov stood and clasped his hands in an 
expression of victory as deputies applauded approval of the plan 
in sundays sovietskaya rossiya newspaper ryzhkov implied he 
would resign if the deputies did not accept his economic proposal 
asked what would happen if the program did not pass ryzhkov 
said then other people will work it out then it will not be 
ryzhkov going to the rostrum but somebody else 
i am responsible for my program i believe in it and i will 
never deny anything that is signed by me if i ever feel fear then 
there is no place for me in the government 
in other action the leadership failed to muster the required 
majority to alter the constitution to allow the communist party and 
other officially approved organizations to continue to fill a third 
of the congress seats themselves the current constitution 
guarantees a third of the seats to those groups

winston lord a career diplomat who served as 
president reagans ambassador to china today denounced president 
bushs decision to send emissaries to beijing as a severely 
misguided step that will make the united states appear weak to 
chinas leaders 
one does not shore up the longterm foundations for 
sinoamerican relations by appearing weak to chinas leaders and 
callous to the chinese and american people lord said in a signed 
column in todays washington post 
one does not earn respect abroad by reversing field within 
months and practicing double standards he said 
lords piece was written before the white houses disclosure on 
monday that brent scowcroft bushs national security adviser and 
lawrence eagleburger the deputy secretary of state secretly 
visited beijing on bushs orders in july 
scowcroft and eagleburger also visited china earlier this month 
the white house announced that visit after they arrived in beijing 
lord served in beijing as us ambassador from 1985 to 1989 he 
was a special assistant to henry kissinger when kissinger first 
visited china in 1971 and served as a special assistant to the 
president for national security affairs in the nixon white house 
bush has come under criticism from democrats and republicans 
alike for the scowcroft mission which was undertaken despite the 
presidents pledge to break off highlevel contacts until chinas 
leaders acted to repair the damage done in the tiananmen square 
massacre of prodemocracy demonstrators last june 
in an interview monday bush said any suggestion that his 
actions amounted to condoning the repression in china was not a 
good rap and its not true 
lord said in seeking improved ties with china the administration 
forfeited the right to censure it on moral grounds but even on 
its own terms the scowcroft mission was severely misguided he 
said arguing it undermined chinas closet modererates 
far from strengthening their hand the admninistration has 
robbed them of the argument that chinese repression and xenophobia 
entail costs he wrote japan europe and others will feel free 
to follow the scowcroft trail 
the former ambassador said that while censure might not 
influence chinas hardline leaders international acquiescence 
in the tiananmen shootings surely reinforces their view that 
crushing their populace elicits only fleeting outcries no lasting 
repercussions 
lord was especially critical of scowcrofts toast during the 
dec 8 visit he said scowcroft lined up the administration with 
the beijing regime against the chinese and american people when 
he said in both our societies there are voices of those who seek 
to redirect or frustrate our cooperation we both must take bold 
measures to overcome these negative forces 
lord contrasted those words with what secretary of state james 
baker said two days later in berlin true stability requires 
governments with legitimacy governments that are based on the 
consent of the governed

judges were told to bring all packages to the attention of the 
marshals so they can be screened and xrayed before opening said 
william dempsey a spokesman for the marshals service in washington 
the advisory also applies to packages bearing familiar names 
because return addresses can be forged or faked dempsey said

offices along a section of a firstfloor corridor when a suspicious 
package addressed to attorney general dick thornburgh turned up in 
the basement mailroom officials said

courthouses across the country another package bomb turned up at

in miami chief deputy us marshal james tassone said packages 
and mail entering the federal courthouses in that city as well as 
in fort lauderdale and west palm beach were being xrayed 
extra inspections of people entering the courthouses also were 
being conducted by guards he said some courthouse employees were 
asked to empty their pockets as they passed through metal detectors 
officials in other courthouses reported that security was 
already tight and didnt need to be upgraded 
but deputy marshal jeff whitney in evansville ind said judges 
were instructed not to open any uninspected packages 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said president bush 
discussed the vance assassination with attorney general dick 
thornburgh who reported that investigators have not reached any 
conclusions about the case 
we just dont have any answers yet as to who might have done 
it to him fitzwater said

mile from panamanian defense forces headquarters 
tensions already were high over saturdays fatal shooting of 
marine 1st lt robert paz 25 of dallas and the reported beating 
of a navy couple who us officials say witnessed the shooting 
the governmentowned newspaper critica today called the two 
incidents epileptic arrogance by the united states and lashed 
out at the cynicism to blame the defense forces for the criminal 
actions of saturday when four us soldiers fired on civilians and 
defenseless women 
us forces stayed on maximum alert but took no public action 
other than to patrol their bases in battle gear traffic and 
business in panama city was normal today 
since noriega was indicted on cocaine trafficking charges in 
florida in february 1988 the united states has tried through 
economic diplomatic and political pressure to drive him from power 
the panamanian leader claims the us drug charges which he 
denies are part of a plot by washington to renege on the 1977 
panama canal treaties which cede control of the waterway at the 
end of the century 
panama says paz and three others with him saturday ran a 
checkpoint and wounded a panamanian soldier and two civilians the 
southern command said they were fleeing a crowd of panamanian 
soldiers and people in civilian clothes when the panamanians opened 
fire

of action is being ruled out as a response 
we are trying to be rational in our response we are going to 
take a calculated plan of action the us government does not 
respond without thinking results through 
he spoke on the condition of anonymity 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the noriega 
governments recent declaration of a state of war with the 
united states may have been a license for harassment and threats 
and in this case murder

said the two military forces were communicating by messenger about 
the incidents a us military source said there had been no 
negotiations

south had demanded an explanation of the american officers death 
and threatened to invade panama 
a southern command spokesman declined to comment on castrejons 
version 
panamas defense forces sent us military officials a letter 
that did not explain the shooting but demanded that us forces 
exercise maximum prudence to avoid unfortunate incidents 
castrejon also denied that the us navy couple was mistreated 
but confirmed they were arrested 
at no time any of our defense forces threaten intimidate or 
much less torture any citizen much less if he is a foreigner or an 
american he said

government leaders and newspapers 
throughout europe displaying rare unison across eastwest borders 
today denounced the romanian government for its bloody repression 
of weekend protests 
scores perhaps hundreds of people were reported killed when 
romanian security forces crushed antigovernment demonstrations on 
saturday and sunday according to unconfirmed reports gunfire was 
said to have also been heard today in timisoara 30 miles from the 
yugoslav border 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze at a session with 
some 200 members of the european parliament in brussels said that 
if reports of bloodshed are true i can only express my very 
profound regret 
we are categorically opposed to the use of force 
shevardnadze said 
there was no comment in beijing where the chinese government 
crushed a peaceful prodemocracy movement with tanks on june 45 
in its first protest to another soviet bloc country the 
bulgarian government today expressed serious concern to the 
romanian embassy in sofia over the unilateral closure of the border 
romania closed its borders to all visitors allowing in only 
diplomats and others with official papers 
foreign ministers of the 12 european community nations denounced 
the violence to suppress the demonstrations several governments 
summoned romanian diplomats to protest 
in brussels the 12 foreign ministers said in a statement the 
regime of president nicolae ceausescu was turning its back on all 
the commitments concerning human rights to which it has 
subscribed 
in poland both parliament and nobel prize winner lech walesa 
unanimously denounced the human rights abuses and demanded romania 
stop the violence 
the british government summoned romanian ambassador stan soare 
to protest in the strongest possible terms about the violent 
crackdown 
a spokesman said soare responded to the british protest by 
resorting to the tired old formula of alleging interference in 
romanias internal affairs 
we urgently called upon the romanian government to end 
policies of repression and allow their citizens to exercise their 
fundamental human rights the foreign office said 
in neighboring hungary feelings ran high because as many as 17 
million ethnic hungarians live in transylvania in the western part 
of romania 
anachronistic regimes opposed to progress cannot remain in 
place if europe is to be united liberal hungarian premier miklos 
nemeth said 
history has already witnessed the reign of regimes not so 
long ago that showed off their strength with tanks before being 
overthrown by the rage of the people the hungarian socialist 
party newspaper nepszabadsag said

an obstetrician convicted of infanticide 
after witnesses said he let an aborted fetus die was placed on 
three years probation today and ordered to perform 300 hours of 
community service 
dr joseph melnick 66 was found guilty in a nonjury trial in 
june the first criminal prosecution under pennsylvanias 1974 
abortion law which requires doctors to do what they can if they 
remove a living fetus 
common pleas judge lynn abraham heeded melnicks plea for 
leniency calling what he did a criminal mistake for which 
neither jail nor a heavy fine was appropriate she also said she 
had no intention of making an example of him 
the mistake the judge said was that the doctor performed an 
abortion on a teenager in her eighth month of pregnancy the 
doctor said he had been told she was in her fourth or fifth month 
state law prohibits most abortions after six months but melnick 
was not charged with performing an illegal abortion 
i am very sorry that this unfortunate incident occurred 
melnick told the judge please do not judge me by this one 
incident alone 
the judge ordered melnick perform his community service in 
medical facilities he could have received 3 to 7 years in prison 
assistant district attorney david webb had asked for a jail term 
and a fin 
witnesses including nurses at west park hospital where the 
1984 abortion on a 13yearold was performed had said that the 
fetus survived about 90 minutes and moved and gasped but that 
melnick ordered that no care be given melnick contended the 
3pound 9ounce girl was stillborn 
the doctor is still practicing state licensing authorities are 
expected to take up the case 
defense attorney richard sprague said he would appeal on grounds 
the verdict was not justified by the evidence 
melnick originally was charged with murder but the charge was 
dismissed on grounds of insufficient evidence and the abortion law 
was invoked

the berlin wall will be opened 
before christmas at the brandenburg gate the towering monument 
viewed by many as a symbol of german unity east german premier 
hans modrow said today 
the announcement followed a meeting between modrow and west 
german chancellor helmut kohl during which the two leaders 
discussed the thorny issue of how to bring the longdivided nations 
closer together 
since the berlin wall started crumbling early last month 
germans in both east and west have demanded an opening at the gate 
to demonstrate the new era of improved relations between the 
countries 
modrow told reporters the new opening for pedestrians will be 
created before monday and the date for visafree travel by west 
germans and west berliners to east germany will be moved up from 
jan 1 to dec 24 in time for christmas and new year 
elsewhere in eastern europe today 
former czechoslovak dissident vaclav havel received an 
endorsement for president from the communist premier marian calfa 
hungarian radio reported that gunfire rang out early today in 
the streets of the romanian city of timisoara where bloody clashes 
between security forces and antigovernment protesters reportedly 
left dozens dead last weekend 
yugoslavias premier suffered a blow after the nations largest 
republic serbia flatly rejected his key reform program that would 
introduce market mechanisms into the ailing economy 
the summit highlighted the debate raging over german 
reunification which kohl supports and modrow opposes 
chants of helmut helmut and germany united 
fatherland rose from the crowd of at least 5000 that lined the 
streets as kohls motorcade of black mercedes limousines carried 
him to the meeting at the hotel bellevue 
workers in hard hats left work to catch a glimpse of the 
chancellor and west german flags and banners calling for german 
unity formed a sea of red black and gold 
but there were signs of opposition to kohls proreunification 
stance 
a fourth reich is that why you stayed behind said one 
poster on a fence in the city center it referred to those east 
germans who have declined to emigrate to wealthy west germany 
choosing instead to stay behind and help rebuild their troubled 
socialist state 
with the ruins of warravaged buildings visible in the distance 
modrow told reporters his first talks with kohl marked a new 
beginning in relations between the countries kohl accepted an 
offer to start negotiations on a treaty to improve relations and 
negotiations will start immediately modrow said 
kohl told reporters he hopes such a treaty can be signed by late 
spring 
he later walked through a crowd of several thousand people 
several signs called for german reunification with one saying 
helmut and hans make us into one germany 
at an outdoor rally kohl drew wild cheers when he referred to 
the crowd as compatriots and said we will not abandon you 
the emotions are nice but we have to see what the reality 
is he said on west germanys zdf television 
kohl said he and modrow would meet again at the end of january 
or the beginning of february 
he said the two sides got closer on some issues citing the 
east german push for a more formal relationship between the two 
states 
the summit was held in dresden because west germany refuses to 
acknowledge east berlin as the capital of a separate and sovereign 
east german state 
east germany has been seeking a treaty community 
establishing fuller ties between east and west germany rather than 
working to join them 
kohl has proposed a 10point plan aimed at eventual german 
reunification 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze today reiterated 
soviet concerns about reunification during a speech to members of 
the european parliament in belgium saying there are two good 
reasons to oppose it 
we the soviet union paid the price of 20 million lives for 
the existing european stability he said of world war ii 
furthermore can the german people themselves forget the national 
tragedy brought onto them by hitlerism 
kohl has made clear that his conservativeled government seeks 
eventual reunification of the two german states that have been 
divided since 1945 
but modrow and many other east germans active in the 
increasingly fragmented political arena have said joining the two 
states would be destabilizing for europe and would result in a 
sellout of east german land and industry 
reunification has become a major topic of public debate and a 
political football in both germanies ever since a massive popular 
uprising forced east germany to open its borders nov 9 and led to 
a crumbling of communist control 
east germanys first free elections are now set for may 6 
chants of germany united fatherland occasionally disrupted 
a candlelight vigil in leipzig on monday night the silent march 
was called by church and reform leaders in memory of the victims of 
stalinism 
the words germany united fatherland were originally part of 
the east german national anthem but have been excised since the 
early 1970s when communist officials dropped reunification as a 
goal

soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze made an unprecedented visit to nato headquarters today 
and said the warsaw pact and nato must remain in place despite 
sharply reduced eastwest tensions 
later he reiterated soviet concerns about german reunification 
and warned western nations not to pressure the german states to 
come together 
we do believe the warsaw treaty and nato at this crucial stage 
in european development are able to play a very important 
stabilizing role to become a stabilizing factor in europe 
shevardnadze told reporters after meeting nato secretarygeneral 
manfred woerner 
woerner said shevardnadze mentioned the very essential role of 
the americans here in europe and that the soviet envoy expressed 
interest in setting up formal links between the two military 
alliances 
woerner said he told shevardnadze the warsaw pact would have to 
make further changes before such a move could be considered 
it was the first time such a high soviet official has been to 
nato headquarters his visit came a day after the western alliance 
issued a report saying the soviet union appears to be cutting 
defense spending 
both officials said they agreed that an accord could be wrapped 
up next year on reducing conventional weapons in europe 
they also agreed a superpower agreement could be worked out next 
year on reducing longrange nuclear weapons 
my impression is that the cold war is indeed over 
shevardnadze said later during a speech to members of the european 
parliament 
during the speech he welcomed the fact that western leaders 
have endorsed reunification if favored by both east and west 
germany but added any appeals or advice to exercise 
selfdetermination or prescriptions as to how and when to change 
the system of government are not only inappropriate but may 
raise doubts about the authenticity of the eventual allegedly free 
choice 
shevardnadze said there are two good reasons to oppose 
reunification 
we the soviet union paid the price of 20 million lives for 
the existing european stability he said of world war ii 
furthermore can the german people themselves forget the 
national tragedy brought onto them by hitlerism 
separately us gen john galvin natos military commander in 
europe called events in eastern europe an enormous transition 
that is fraught with potential dangers of instability and 
uncertainty 
in the face of this a unified nato can be very helpful and 
it appears the soviets recognize this as well galvin said in a 
statement 
shevardnadzes visit to nato was viewed as carrying great 
symbolic importance at a time of a rapidly changing eastwest 
climate 
on monday nato released a study that said the soviet union 
appears to have begun cutting its defense expenditures including 
in the critical area of conventional forces 
the analysis offers new evidence that the kremlin is trying to 
pare down its massive military industry 
a year ago soviet president mikhail s gorbachev went before 
the united nations and promised to unilaterally cut soviet forces 
by 500000 troops and reduce conventional arms substantially 
a month later he called for a 142 percent cut in military 
spending and a 195 percent reduction in military production 
a number of major procurement programs particularly in the 
land armaments area are being scaled back the nato report says 
it adds however that it is too early to tell whether all of 
gorbachevs promises will be carried out 
to the european parliament shevardnadze outlined at length his 
concerns about german reunification 
where are the political legal and material guarantees that 
german unity would not eventually create a threat to the national 
security of other states and to peace in europe he asked 
will such a hypothetical germany be ready to accept the 
existing borders in europe and renounce any territorial claims as 
we know the government of the federal republic of germany has 
avoided answering that question 
europe he said must have two sovereign german states a 
retreat from that is fraught with destabilization in europe 
shevardnadze later flew to london for talks with prime minister 
margaret thatcher he made no statement upon arriving at the 
airport

the driver accused in a collision that 
killed 27 people on a church bus gulped down a vodka drink shortly 
before the crash a witness testified 
kelly osborne testifying for the prosecution monday blew 
away defense attorneys argument that larry mahoney was tricked 
into getting drunk said special prosecutor paul richwalsky 
mahoney just picked up the cup and he just drank it 
straight down osborne testified he coughed a couple of times 
i figured it was just because he had drank it so quick 
later monday william boehly a statistician for the national 
highway traffic safety administration said there was never a 
comparable disaster with a school bus and that no child had died 
from a fire aboard a school bus since 1975 
rebuttal testimony continued today with an auto safety 
consultant for the defense disputing the prosecutions contention 
that the bus was safe 
byron bloch of potomac md testified that school buses were 
safe only from boehlys narrow statistical perspective it 
would be erroneous to conclude that his data rubberstamp the 
accident bus as a safe bus said bloch 
mahoney 36 is accused of causing the nations worst 
drunkendriving accident on may 14 1988 when he drove his pickup 
truck on the wrong side of interstate 71 five miles south of 
carrollton striking the bus 
the case was expected to go to the jury on wednesday 
mahoney a factory worker is charged with 27 counts of murder 
for the 24 children and three adults 12 counts of firstdegree 
assault representing the most severely injured survivors 42 
counts of wanton endangerment for other survivors and motorists who 
dodged his pickup on the wrong side of the divided highway and one 
count of drunken driving 
the bus a 1977 model built by ford motor co and shellerglobe 
corp was owned by the radcliff first assembly of god church in 
hardin county 100 miles southwest the victims had been on a 
church outing to an amusement park near cincinnati 
prosecution testimony monday began with osborne who said 
mahoney had asked him for the mixed drink of vodka and sprite 
that he downed at the home of jay gibson osbornes neighbor 
hildebrand and other defense attorneys disparaged osbornes 
testimony pointing out that he failed to mention vodka he only 
talked of mahoney drinking beer in at least three interviews with 
investigators on both sides 
autopsies showed the 27 died of smoke inhalation 
eugene sober a fire safety engineer for the national 
aeronautics and space administration testified for the defense 
last week that many of the victims could have survived if the bus 
seats had been fire resistant 
but hugh t spencer a university of louisville chemical 
engineering professor and accident consultant said the victims 
were doomed from the instant that fuel from the ruptured gas tank 
ignited 
it was over at that point he said

the navys top admiral has told commanders 
they must do better to improve the services safety record 
following evaluation of the unprecedented twoday freeze on routine 
operations last month navy sources said today 
adm carlisle a h trost chief of naval operations faulted 
commanders for exercising poor supervision during the navys many 
dangerous operations saying the level of effective supervision on 
the scene was often inadequate when accidents occurred 
trost offered the critique in a letter monday that summed up his 
findings in light of the midnovember safety standdown he had 
ordered after a string of serious accidents killed 10 sailors 
the associated press obtained the contents of trosts letter 
from navy sources 
the admiral told commanders that he found the standdown was 
executed professionally at all levels and that there was no single 
thread that tied the string of accidents together

must do better

china on tuesday criticized demands for greater 
democracy in hong kong as an attempt to bring the chinese 
government to its knees and limit its sovereignty after britain 
returns the colony in 1997 
it also said it was up to britain to come back to the correct 
road of friendly cooperation chinas relations with britain as 
with most western countries have deteriorated following the 
chinese army attack on prodemocracy protesters in june 
the comments came in a lengthy essay excerpted in the official 
peoples daily and other newspapers to be published in full in the 
weekly beijing review magazine the essay marked the fifth 
anniversary of the signing of the sinobritish joint declaration in 
which britain agreed to return hong kong and china agreed to let it 
remain capitalist for at least 50 years 
the essay said that although hong kong will retain a high 
degree of autonomy after 1997 its relationship to beijing will 
be that of a local government to a sovereign central state 
some people in an attempt to pit democracy against 
communism suggest that the democratic process be accelerated in 
developing hong kongs democratic system the essay said 
they stress that this is the desire of the hong kong people in 
an attempt to create a de facto situation to bring the chinese 
government to its knees these people are actually seeking under 
the pretext of democracy to establish a power pattern in hong kong 
after 1997 that will harm chinas sovereignty it said 
this we resolutely oppose 
some hong kong residents fearful of chinese rule have pressed 
the colonial government to introduce more democratic rule in the 
hope that china would find it hard to undo such reforms after 1997 
the hong kong government has agreed to allow elections in 1991 to 
fill 10 of the 56 seats in the colonys legislative council which 
is appointed by the government and local interest groups 
there also have been calls for at least 40 percent of hong 
kongs post1997 legislature to be popularly elected but the hong 
kongchinese committee drafting the colonys post1997 basic law 
recently agreed that only 30 percent of the delegates should be 
chosen by elections 
china has reiterated that it will not allow hong kong to become 
a base for antigovernment and anticommunist activity and has 
moved to include in the basic law provisions against subversive 
activity 
the essay said hong kong residents will be allowed after 1997 to 
raise opinions about chinas state affairs but only through legal 
channels 
if unsuitable means are adopted to express ones own 
viewpoints things might go contrary to their wishes and damage 
might be brought upon the friendly relationship between the 
mainland and hong kong it warned all political activity will 
have to respect the mainlands socialist system it said 
the mainlands constitution allows no political activity 
independent of the communist party 
a committee of 33 mainland delegates and 23 hong kong delegates 
is working on the final draft of hong kongs post1997 basic law 
it is to be submitted to chinas legislature in the spring for 
approval

traditional english versions of the bible say 
jesus was born in a stable because there was no room in the inn 
but a new look at the old words suggests there probably wasnt even 
an inn at bethlehem 
biblical scholar jim fleming said joseph and mary more likely 
couldnt get the guest room at a family compound crowded with 
other relatives home for a romanmandated census and sought 
privacy in a nearby stable 
the stable he adds probably was not a cozy wooden structure 
but a shepherds cave cut into limestone 
and the manger or feeding trough was not hewn from wood but 
built of stone he says 
fleming said at newsconference sponsored by israels tourism 
ministry that he is not challenging doctrine but interpretation 
the message is to try to help christians to understand the 
simplicity of christs birth he said 
fleming director of the biblical resources study center near 
bethlehem believes the traditional image of the first christmas 
stems from inaccurate translation of early greek versions of the 
new testament 
these greek texts of the nativity in luke use the word 
katalymati 
inn he says may be traditional but it is a bad 
translation the word normally is translated as guest chamber 
so what nearly 2000 years ago was a guest chamber and why 
wasnt it available to mary and joseph 
most houses from the time of jesus were many roomed 
apartment compounds for multiple families fleming said in 
such clusters one room was reserved for relatives or friends of 
any of the families living in the compound 
fleming notes that joseph and mary like thousands of other 
families were required to return to their home town for a census 
if the katalymati the guest chamber was already taken they 
would go elsewhere seeking privacy for the birth he said 
and what better place he said than a stable cut into 
limestone such stablecaves still dot the surrounding landscape 
animals were kept in caves because they maintained a constant

glasnost has come to the home of 
amerika a 1986 television miniseries that depicted fictitious 
life in the united states after a soviet takeover 
techumseh high school and elementary students recently began 
receiving responses to letters they wrote in august to students in 
ryazan 150 miles southwest of moscow 
teachers are hoping the letters educate their students about the 
vastness of the world and about the society and politics of the 
soviet union which had taken over tecumseh during the filming 
of the miniseries in this southeastern nebraska town of 1900 
i hope they get a better understanding of the world that 
its a much bigger place than just tecumseh and that people around 
the world do similar things said janene bartels a firstgrade 
teacher who helped initiate the project 
high school english teacher sheryl allen said world politics 
seemed too distant for most of todays students 
theyre more concerned with what theyre doing this weekend or 
what theyre doing after the basketball game allen said im 
hoping this might personalize it for them so that theyll turn on 
the news at night 
students in allens senior english classes received individual 
responses while students in bartels firstgrade class received 
one letter for the entire class complete with photos of the class 
and ryazan 
the letters already have dispelled some stereotypes 
jamie carson a 17yearold senior said she perceived the 
soviet union as cold gray and very strict but discovered that 
teen interests in music clothes and sports were very similar 
soviet students mentioned billy joel and michael jackson as rock 
music idols and talked of brands of clothing available in america 
mark sherman a 17yearold senior said he was amazed that his 
pen pal a 16yearold aspiring actress was so stylishly dressed 
and that her photograph had appeared in a national magazine 
i had the impression there were people walking around the 
streets with guns sherman said he and the other senior english 
students said they hoped they could dispell some myths about 
americans too 
the letter exchange was intitiated by col barney oldfield a 
johnson county native who is now a beverly hills calif author 
publicist and consultant on soviet affairs to the litton corp the 
wife of oldfields russian interpreter galina korzhikova is an 
english teacher in ryazan 
bartels said she hoped the student letter exchange would pay 
dividends in promoting better ussoviet relations 
maybe by the time they grow up communications with russia 
will be very open she said but for now its a start

the white house today defended president 
bushs secret dealings with china insisting he has been forthright 
with the american people but saying he feels free to send 
emissaries on unpublicized missions 
the statement from white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
came amid criticism from a congressional leader that bush misled 
the american people by sending highlevel officials to beijing 
barely a month after the bloody crackdown on prodemocracy 
demonstrators 
the secret mission in july kept hidden from the public and 
congress until monday was carried out by national security adviser 
brent scowcroft and deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger 
the two officials visited beijing on bushs orders even as the 
united states was saying that highlevel us exchanges had been 
cut in protest of the crushing of the prodemocracy movement 
weve been forthright fitzwater said today the 
forthrightness is in saying we are going to have these kinds of 
contacts 
we have and will have such trips and they will be secret 
and it is not misleading to tell you about everything hes doing 
the presidents up there in the oval office doing things all day 
long that you dont know and wont know about and thats not 
misleading the spokesman said 
he refused to say whether there have been any other highlevel 
contacts with china that have been kept secret 
speaking generally about bushs foreign policy fitzwater said 
there have been trips you dont know about and there will be 
more 
it was scowcroft and eagleburger who also quietly traveled to 
china this month expressing hopes to bring new impetus and 
vigor in sinoamerican relations 
in beijing today chinas foreign ministry issued a statement 
saying the government had received scowcroft last july at the 
unites states request 
such highlevel contacts between china and the united states 
are useful and conducive to enhancing the mutual understanding 
the statement from beijing said 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said in a 
statement he was astonished to learn of the july meeting 
saying the trips to beijing make a mockery of our profession of 
concern for human rights and the stated ideals of our democratic 
system of government 
mitchell called on the bush administration to disclose all us 
contacts with the chinese government 
however fitzwater said monday that he could not rule out the 
possibility that scowcroft and eagleburger or other top officials 
had made other stillsecret trips to china 
the dec 8 visit was announced after the two officials arrived 
in beijing the july visit was acknowledged only after it was 
reported by the cable news network and the white house refused to 
provide any details even the date of the trip 
rep sam gejdenson dconn chairman of a house foreign affairs 
subcommittee on trade said bush misled the american people and 
the congress 
how does the white house square that earlier trip with their 
statements at the time that highlevel contacts with the chinese 
were cut off gejdenson said the sad reality is that the 
president confuses his personal relationship with the chinese 
leaders with what is good national policy 
fitzwater said bush felt it was essential to hold quiet 
diplomatic discussions with china outside the public glare 
regarding its crackdown 
the president has had years of experience with china and he 
knows that facetoface declarations are important to them and 
felt it was important that they knew privately and from someone on 
his immediate staff just how strongly the united states felt about 
this fitzwater said 
a white house statement said the july mission was undertaken to 
underscore us shock and concern about the violence in tiananmen 
square and to impress upon the chinese government the seriousness 
with which this incident was viewed in the united states 
even before the july trip to beijing was disclosed bush was 
defending his china policies insisting that the united states 
should not isolate a country with a population of more than a 
billion people 
bush refused to say whether chinas hardline leaders offered any 
concessions in exchange for his gesture of taking the first step to 
repair relations 
im not going to discuss what i did or didnt get the 
president said 
you see i still believe that sometimes to affect change you 
talk in confidence to people bush said who has been accused by 
democrats of kowtowing to china 
and i notice now bush said that some of the critics who 
were so opposed and using this fantastically diabolically 
antime language they come up now in saying well if you get a 
b and c then it will be all right or then well understand let 
them just stay tuned 
bush also said he does not know when chinese dissident fang 
lizhi will be able to leave the us embassy in beijing where he 
has taken refuge since the crackdown quoting scowcroft fitzwater 
denied there were any negotiations with china about an acceptable 
country where fang might go

state officials will review the prison 
work release system in bradenton after an escapee was arrested on 
rape charges in the second such incident in six weeks 
one rape suspect was on work release the other was assigned to 
the minimumsecurity work release center but was not authorized to 
work outside the facility chief rod groom administrator of the 
center said today 
david tune head of the states work release system and a team 
of corrections officials will review the backgrounds of all inmates 
in the bradenton center to ensure they qualify for work release 
the bradenton herald reported today 
officials said some changes in the system are likely after the 
latest escape the fourth in six weeks 
the inquiry follows an attack sunday morning on a bradenton 
woman sheriffs deputies charged gilbert diamond 30 of tarpon 
springs with breaking into her home and attacking her at knifepoint 
diamond who was convicted of burglary and aggravated assault 
had left his workrelease job as a dishwasher at an allnight 
restaurant early and did not return to the center 
work release is a kind of correctional halfway house convicts 
are allowed to finish their sentences while holding jobs outside 
jail the only time they are permitted to be away from the center 
is during working hours 
the program is open to almost all inmates with less than two 
years left to serve only sex offenders and kidnappers are 
automatically excluded 
kidnappers were also excluded earlier this month after a man 
convicted of that offense craig allan mrozowski 30 escaped from 
the bradenton center where he worked as a cook and trusty and was 
later accused of raping an oneco woman 
corrections department spokesman bob macmaster said the first 
thing the inspection team will look at is whether to let inmates 
work latenight shifts skeleton staffs make it difficult for 
employers to keep tabs on them and darkness makes it hard to track 
down escapees officials said 
the exclusion of all violent felons from the program would have 
a substantial impact but officials did not know how many of the 
3020 work release prisoners statewide would be returned to jail 
only four or five of the 101 inmates at the bradenton center 
work nights said the facilitys administrator rod groom

an official opposition to the communist party 
walesa whose solidarity trade union overwhelmed polands 
communist party in free elections and formed the first 
noncommunist government in eastern europe said sakharovs death 
was a huge loss for the reforms for perestroika in the soviet 
bloc 
his mind his thoughts were needed by the soviet people very 
much in these difficult times walesa said in the soviet union

walesa and sakharov who both won nobel peace prizes fought for 
human rights and peaceful reform at the cost of their personal 
freedom

soviet union walesa looked at a soviet reporter and said you do

political reforms he said a strong will and strong nerves are 
needed to choose the right path to overcome all the difficulties

two years after the wampanoag indians won a battle 
to gain official recognition as a tribe they are willing to pit 
themselves against a major telephone company to get into the 
cellular phone business 
the tribe is after a federal communications commission license 
estimated to be worth millions of dollars that was to be awarded by 
lottery wednesday 
the wampanoags formed a company to operate a cellular telephone 
system on cape cod and its surrounding islands off the 
massachusetts coast within a year after they won a promise of land 
for a reservation on one of the islands marthas vineyard 
revenues from the company would help them build their community 
the say 
all they need now is the license but nynex corp says the tribe 
isnt providing telephone service so is not eligible to compete in 
the lottery against the already established company the wampanoags 
say federal law favors indian economic development 
the fcc lottery pits indian cellular telephone co against nynex 
mobile communications a subsidiary of nynex corp which provides 
phone service throughout new york and new england 
the issue is complicated by the fact that two licenses will be 
awarded 
one license will go to a wire line applicant defined as a 
company that provides phone service to the area the other will go 
to a nonwire line applicant which can be a company or 
individual with demonstrated financial ability to run the system 
the fcc has hundreds of nonwire line applicants but only three 
on the other side the wampanoags nynex mobile and elizabeth 
islands telephone co which serves a small number of phones on 
naushon island 
nynex and elizabeth islands struck a deal before the lottery 
peter harrigan general manager of nynex mobile refused to 
disclose the details except to say we have two of the three 
chips 
if the third chip belonging to the wampanoags is picked 
harrigan said his company will appeal the case to the fcc 
we dont believe indian cellular is a qualified applicant 
he said there is a rule that you have to be providing telephone 
service 
but tom tureen a lawyer for the tribe said while indian 
cellular does not currently provide phone service it should 
nonetheless be considered a phone company under fcc rules 
federal laws must be interpreted to take the special status of 
tribes into consideration he said federal indian policy 
favors indian economic development and self determination 
myron peck deputy chief of mobile services for the fcc said he 
could not discuss whether the agencys rules would be bent for the 
wampanoags 
if they happen to win depending on the issues that are 
raised we will look at it then he said 
peck said the fcc has not yet been forced to decide such an 
issue a similar case occurred in arizona where the gila river 
indians won a lottery but they reached a settlement recently with 
a subsidiary of us west communications before the case reached 
the commission 
tureen said he could not predict whether the wampanoags would 
settle the case if they are contested we will vigorously pursue 
our application he said weve had tough battles before 
the wampanoags gained federal recognition as a tribe in 1987 
culminating a legal battle begun in 1974 when the wampanoags filed 
a lawsuit to recover aboriginal lands 
about 280 wampanoag indians live on marthas vineyard and the 
tribe is renting office space in the town of gay head about 250 
acres of land have been put into federal trust once the land 
acquisition is finished the tribe will have a reservation where 
the indians can build homes 
forrest cuch a tribal planner said if the wampanoags get the 
license the revenue could help with housing offices and community 
buildings 
that would really get us off the ground he said

the bush administration today condemned the 
brutal use of police force in romania and said the united 
states was consulting with allies about the possibility of sending 
independent observers to see what was happening 
the repressive measures undertaken by the romanian government 
are totally unjustified and stand in stark contrast to the positive 
changes taking place elsewhere in eastern europe said white 
house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
the united states condemns the brutal use of police force by 
the romanian government fitzwater said 
romania has virtually sealed off its borders but witnesses say 
security forces have shot and killed dozens of people in 
antigovernment rioting that began over the weekend 
unconfirmed reports have put the death toll at up to 400 and one 
witness was quoted as saying he saw helicopters fire on crowds in 
the city of timisoara 
the demonstrations in timisoara and elsewhere were a result of 
the systematic denial of human rights to the people of romania 
particularly to members of the hungarian minority fitzwater said 
he said the united states was calling on the government to 
cease this brutal repression open its borders and respect the 
human rights commitments of the helsinki final act 
moreover he said the united states was urging romania to allow 
international observers to visit timisoara and other cities where 
violence has been reported on that point fitzwater said the 
united states was consulting with allies in hopes of getting an 
independent verfication of what was transpiring 
fitzwater said there is a provision under the 35nation 
conference on security and cooperation in europe that allows member 
countries to verify independently events in other participating 
states both romania and the united states are members of the 
conference

premier marian calfa said tuesday 
all domestic operations of the dreaded secret police have been 
halted 
it is one of our priorities to adjust the work of the interior 
ministry to the new social conditions and turn this ministry into a 
component of state administration based on democratic principles 
calfa told parliament outlining his domestic and foreign policies 
i can tell you that as of today the operations of the police 
force in the field of internal intelligence have been stopped 
calfa said 
in 41 years of communist rule secret police agents were 
involved in continuous surveillance operations against citizens and 
were responsible for the interrogation and harassment of dissidents 
and independent thinkers 
opposition leader vaclav havel once a dissident playwright and 
now the leading contender for president has spoken about the 
constant threat of a house search that every visitor to his home 
was photographed and every conversation bugged by the communist 
regime 
havels house in downtown prague was continuously monitored from 
a nearby tower and cameras were installed by the secret police in 
other streets where dissidents lived 
police have been the target of public anger since they broke up 
a peaceful student rally nov 17 igniting the prodemocracy 
revolution that ended communist domination 
the police action in the streets of prague has shaken the 
faith of citizens in the police force the government is taking 
steps to prevent the abuse of security forces against the people of 
this country calfa said 
a parliamentary commission is investigating the crackdown 
the new government the countrys first noncommunistdominated 
cabinet in 41 years does not include an interior minister 
responsible for all branches of the police including the secret 
force instead those functions have been assumed by a threeman 
committee consisting of calfa and two deputy premiers 
despite the move to control the secret police opposition 
members and students fearing a coverup of past misdeeds have been 
patrolling police offices and police archives to prevent the 
destruction of incriminating documents 
activists in brno reported last week that police documents were 
being burned including documents from the 1950s and others bearing 
the names of wellknown dissidents

most mass slayings of jews took place in the baltic republic more 
than 200000 jews are believed to have been murdered by the nazis 
in lithuania 
lithuania was a center of jewish culture in eastern europe in 
the 18th and 19th centuries and a nesting ground for the zionist 
ideology that led to the creation of israel the jewish community 
there numbered 15 million at the turn of the century and only 
26000 after world war ii 
kuniuchovsky a survivor of the jewish ghetto in the city of 
kovno took the testimony from refugees after the war on behalf of 
historical commissions set up by the allies in displaced persons 
camps in west germany zuroff said 
his records are valuable because they provide rare accounts from 
the few jews who survived the mass slayings that took place in 
isolated towns and villages zuroff said in an interview 
he said the 1300 names were gathered from 1683 pages of 
testimony that kuniuchovsky took from survivors in 171 towns and 
villages 
hundreds of the suspects were known to be alive zuroff added 
he declined to give names of the suspects suggesting this could 
harm efforts to seek them out for prosecution 
the majority were previously unknown to us he said noting 
the earlier testimony was sketchy about slayings in many isolated 
areas because survivors were few and investigators were unable to 
find them in later years 
zuroff said the wiesenthal center is tracking the suspects 
through its four branches in the united states one in toronto and 
other agencies the center is named for founder simon wiesenthal 
80 an austrianborn concentration camp survivor who has devoted 
much of his life to hunting down nazi war criminals and documenting 
the holocaust 
in addition to new suspects names kuniuchovskys file also 
contains surprising information about the numbers of lithuanians 
involved in the killings zuroff said 
it is shocking to see such a big role was played by the 
intelligentsia zuroff added were talking about school 
teachers educated people who belonged to vigilante groups or 
helped local police carry out killings 
zuroff also said he hoped legislation adopted in the past two 
years in canada and australia allowing prosecution of crimes 
committed overseas would make it easier to hunt and prosecute the 
lithuanian suspects

a former justice department investigator said 
today victor stello jr nominated by president bush to head the 
nations nuclear arms production lied to him during a probe of the 
three mile island nuclear accident 
julian greenspun also told the senate armed services committee 
that stello had been a total bully when he worked at the 
nuclear regulatory commission 
greenspun said stello as the chief of staff at the nrc lied 
to me during greenspuns investigation of the 1979 three mile 
island nuclear reactor accident in pennsylvania 
the former investigator said stello had told him the power 
plants owner was not required to keep records of tests conducted 
on cooling pipes greenspun said he later learned the records were 
in fact required and were central to the justice department 
investigation 
stello was scheduled to appear later in the day to respond to 
the allegations by greenspun and other witnesses called by the 
committee 
a number of things occurred that gave me great pause as a 
prosecutor and as civil servant in terms of his candor and his 
being a total bully at the nrc for people who had differences of 
opinion greenspun told the committee 
one of stellos supporters on the committee sen john warner 
rva asked greenspun if he knew of any instances in which stello 
had broken the law 
greenspun responded thats sort of like a politician saying 
i ought to be elected because i havent been indicted yet 
greenspun did not charge that stello had broken any laws in his 
dealings with the investigator 
stello was apperaing before the panel for the second time in 
little more than a month in his effort to become assistant energy 
secretary for defense programs the chief manager of the nations 
nuclear weapons program 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a committee vote on the nomination is not expected before 
congress reconvenes jan 23 
energy secretary james d watkins made a highly unusual personal 
plea to the committee last month to confirm stello saying the 
department urgently needed him in the post in order to carry out 
major safety improvements at the arms plants many of the 
facilities are closed down for safety and technical reasons 
the committee on nov 17 deferred a decision on stello saying 
it wanted to hear from additional witnesses including officials 
who worked with him during his 26 years at the nuclear regulatory 
commission which governs civilian uses of nuclear power 
former nrc chairmen john ahearne and joseph hendrie were to be 
among those testifying today ahearne has said he believes stello 
is fully qualified for the weapons job 
in a related development watkins told the house and senate 
armed services committees in letters sent last friday that he 
decided at stellos recommendation to put off a decision on when 
to restart the savannah river nuclear production reactors until a 
study of environmental impacts is completed 
it was not clear whether the decision could mean a delay in 
resuming savannah river production of tritium a manmade gas 
needed to make nuclear warheads copies of watkins letter were 
made public monday by a member of the house panel 
stello was nominated for the energy department job in july he 
then began working as an adviser to watkins on the savannah river 
restart project pending a senate decision on his nomination last 
month watkins decided to give stello a secondlevel appointment in 
the weapons office which does not require senate confirmation 
three democratic members of the committee sens john glenn of 
ohio timothy wirth of colorado and edward kennedy of massachusetts 
have led the fight against stello they contend he is illsuited 
to improve safety conditions at the plants 
most members of the committee have not publicly said whether 
they will vote for stello 
while serving as the chief staff official at the nrc stello was 
accused of altering agency regulations at the request of utilities 
that operate nuclear rectors and authorizing cash payments to an 
informant as part of a vendetta within the nrc 
at his first confirmation hearing in november stello strongly 
defended his professional record and said he was being unfairly 
attacked by antinuclear forces and political opponents of 
controversial decisions he made at the nrc 
in a development that could stiffen resistance to stellos 
nomination an outside investigator concluded in a report made 
public dec 9 that the cash payments to an informant were made 
because of personal conflicts within the nrc that contradicts 
stellos assertion that the payments were made in order to obtain 
information about wrongdoing that could affect safety at a nuclear 
power plant

president bush worked tuesday toward a final 
version of a 1991 budget plan that sources said would include a 
record 124 trillion in spending meanwhile he signed a 
deficitfighting bill trimming the budget for this year 
despite bushs no new taxes vows the new federal budget 
also is likely to propose a series of new excise taxes including a 
fee on the sale of certain recreational equipment and vehicles 
said officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater confirmed that the office 
of management and budget was weighing such a levy among other 
user fees however fitzwater added the budget is not final 
and the decisions have not been made in the final sense 
administration sources said the white house had tentatively 
decided to propose new excise taxes on such recreational gear and 
vehicles as camping equipment and offroad vehicles to pay for 
conservation measures 
other sources said bush has tentatively decided against a new 
excise tax on the sale of boats and recreational vehicles even 
though an earlier budgetoffice draft contained such fees 
bush plans to resolve all outstanding issues on the new budget 
before he leaves town friday for a tenday christmas vacation the 
1991 budget for the fiscal year that begins next oct 1 goes to 
congress on jan 22 
bushs signature on the 147 billion budget reconciliation bill 
closes the book on the 1990 budget with total spending put at 
just under 12 trillion and lifts an order that had imposed 
162 billion in mandatory cuts last october 
the acrosstheboard cuts imposed would have disrupted some 
important federal activities had they remained in effect all 
year bush said in signing the measure 
bush praised congress for making the new cuts in a manner 
consistent with my pledge not to raise new taxes 
in congress debate on the deficitreduction package broke down 
into partisan wrangling as the white house sought unsuccessfully to 
use the measure as a vehicle for its bid for a lower capital gains 
tax 
to accomplish the needed savings the bill retains 46 billion 
of the acrosstheboard cuts and enacts 6 billion in new taxes and 
fees mostly on corporations 
it makes up the rest by trimming medicare payments to doctors 
and hospitals cutting some farm programs stretching out payments 
in some federal retirement programs and speeding up collections on 
payroll and gasoline taxes 
as for the fiscal 1991 budget while officials will not discuss 
it publicly an outline is slowly taking shape that sources say 
will include 
military spending of 292 billion just 1 billion over the 
current level reduced world tensions are responsible for some of 
the defense slowdown expected to be the smallest percentage 
increase in a decade 
no major new initiatives but modest increases in some 
programs including the environment education aids research and 
anticrime and drug efforts generally reflecting many of bushs 
firstyear initiatives 
the abolition of some minor programs but nothing like the 
proposed wholesale agency terminations unsuccessfully proposed by 
former president reagan cuts in medicare funds and the proposed 
sale of some federal assets 
a renewal of bushs campaign for a lower capital gains tax a 
cut the administration sees as a big revenueraiser 
a revival in slightly different form of bushs 1988 campaign 
proposal under which americans could save up to 5000 a year in 
special taxfree family savings accounts for funds deposited 10 
or more years 
an overhaul and consolidation of the governments credit 
programs seeking to save tax dollars by streamlining bookkeeping 
on a wide range of government loans 
the administration must come up with some 40 billion in deficit 
savings in a mix of spending cuts and revenue increases to get the 
budget deficit down on paper at least to the 64 billion 
deficit target in the grammrudman budget balancing law for fiscal 
1991 
the target for fiscal 1989 was 100 billion 
the budgetwriting chore is being made easier this year by 
bushs decision to keep the increase in defense spending down and 
by a still healthy economy now in its eighth year of recovery with 
inflation holding steady at a moderate 4 percent to 5 percent

prince charles on tuesday lamented the 
calamitous decline in literacy in britain and the degeneration 
of the english language into a dismal wasteland of banality 
cliche and casual obscenity 
in june the heir to the british throne had complained english 
was taught so bloody badly that he had to correct all the 
letters written by his staff before they were sent out 
his criticism tuesday was more elegantly phrased but equally 
biting in singling out the teaching profession for discarding the 
idea that english is a precious legacy to be handled with care 
we have seen the abandonment of learning the rules of grammar 
and the parts of speech as boring and irrelevant he said 
past attacks by the 41yearold prince on the state of language 
modern buildings inner cities and urban sprawl have made him 
respected and feared 
in the packed london church of st james garlickhythe he 
presented prizes to children for their memorized recitations from 
the book of common prayer attributed to archbishop of canterbury 
thomas cranmer to mark the 500th anniversary of his birth 
he then deplored the ending in schools of learning poetry by 
heart and the idea of english as something really to be learned by 
effort and application 
the prince also denounced what he called banal modern 
versions of cranmers prayer book and the 17th century king james 
bible the originals were commanding and poetic he said 
poetry was for everybody but banality is for nobody it might 
be accessible for all but so is a desert he said 
is it entirely an accident that the defacing of cranmers 
prayer book has coincided with a calamitous decline in literacy and 
the quality of english he asked 
he said britain had produced the worlds most successful 
language which had been the medium for some of the greatest 
literature yet a great many people today look in dismay at what 
is happening to that language in the very place where it evolved 
looking at the way english is used in our popular newspapers 
our radio and television programs even in our schools and our 
theaters they wonder what it is about our country and our society 
that our language has become so impoverished so sloppy and so 
limited that we have arrived at such a dismal wasteland of 
banality cliche and casual obscenity the prince said 
he said his stand for englands heritage had led to accusations 
of nostalgia for an irrelevant past 
the fear of being considered oldfashioned seems to be so 
allpowerful that the more eternal values and principles which run 
like a thread through the whole tapestry of human existence are 
abandoned under the false assumption that they restrict progress 
he said 
the prince had his audience laughing when he declared 
well im not afraid of being considered oldfashioned which 
is why i am standing here wearing a doublebreasted suit and 
turnups pantcuffs to my trousers ready to declaim the fact 
that i believe the prayer book is a glorious part of every english 
speakers heritage and as such ought to be a grade one listed 
edifice the english phrase for a stateprotected building 
after the speech doug mcavoy general secretary of the national 
union of teachers said teachers of english had not given up 
standards but they had an exhausting task in state schools 
the rt rev john taylor church of england bishop of st 
albans said cranmers language was magnificent and beautiful but 
the churchs new liturgy enabled modern congregations to use a 
language reflecting their hopes and prayers 
a governmentappointed committee reported last year that 
although english is the first language of 320 million people around 
the world and spoken daily by about 1 billion people the teaching 
of english had been neglected in its country of origin the 
committee recommended that every school employ a teacher whose sole 
job is to ensure the language is used properly

the ruling party and main opposition 
merged tuesday with their first national congress charged with 
framing a new constitution 
since independence a decade ago president robert mugabes 
dominant zimbabwe african national union patriotic front has been 
avowedly marxistleninist former zimbabwe african peoples union 
opposition leader joshua nkomo was more centrist 
about 4200 delegates from the two parties gathered for the 
fourday congress that will decide which ideological path to tread 
in the light of changes in eastern europe long mugabes role model 
conferees also will be asked to rule whether the new alliance 
should continue to pursue mugabes dream of creating a oneparty 
state in one of africas few westernstyle democracies 
the congress effectively formalizes a decision by zimbabwes two 
main political figures two years ago to unite their parties ending 
decades of interparty feuding 
the alliance also seeks to bury 200 years of tribal hostilities 
between the majority shona tribe which largely backs mugabe and 
the ndebele people who traditionally support nkomo 
the birth of the reconstituted zanu arms mugabe with the support 
of all but two lawmakers in the 100seat national assembly and the 
40member rubberstamp senate 
the ruling party can pass laws and rewrite sections of the 
britishdrafted constitution a document signed by all parties at 
londons lancaster house 10 years ago thursday 
those constitutional talks ended nine decades of white minority 
rule halted a sevenyear war waged by guerrillas loyal to nkomo 
and mugabe and transformed the british colony of rhodesia into 
blackgoverned zimbabwe at independence april 18 1980 
the constitution guaranteed zimbabwe would be a multiparty 
democracy for the first 10 years of independence 
after the 10th anniversary mugabe can constitutionally ban 
opposition and establish a singleparty state with twothirds of 
the votes in parliament 
but in recent months as prodemocratic movements have swept 
eastern europe mugabe has come under mounting pressure to renounce 
what he calls his marxistleninist policies and to abandon the aim 
of killing the multiparty system 
opening the congress mugabe indicated his stand was flexible 
while we must be clear as to the ideological direction we take 
namely marxistleninist socialist principles we must also take 
full cognisance of the environment and the concrete realities in 
which we seek to achieve social transformation he said 
the congress which ends friday is being attended also by 
presidents quett masire of botswana and kenneth kaunda of zambia as 
well as observers from 20 countries including cuba north korea and 
nicaragua

in a reluctant break with president bush 
winston lord americas ambassador to china until last april 
denounced the administrations secret diplomatic missions to 
beijing tuesday as steps that will undercut chinas moderates 
he said the united states was signaling the world that the 
blood around tiananmen square has truly been scrubbed away 
the united states would not have reversed course so swiftly if 
the killings of prodemocracy demonstrators had occurred in eastern 
europe lord said contending that the pilgrimage to china this 
month by presidential aide brent scowcroft displayed cultural if 
not racial bias 
in a telephone interview from new york where he is now a writer 
and lecturer lord said he had supported bushs posttiananmen 
square policy of seeking to preserve a valued relationship with 
china but the scowcroft trip pushed me over the edge 
he made his public break with bushs policy in a signed article 
in the washington post written he said before mondays 
revelation that scowcroft had also led a mission to beijing last 
july barely a month after the violent crackdown 
i served briefly in china under president bush and i have 
great respect for him and his knowledge of china lord said i 
would have preferred not to have disagreed but i felt this trip 
was such a mistake that i had no choice 
i felt i could speak with some credibility as one who had 
worked on the china issue for 20 years who had met chairman mao 
tsetung five times spent hundreds of hours with chou enlai 
has known deng xiaping for 15 years and made 11 trips to china 
before becoming ambassador lord said he served as us envoy to 
beijing for 3 years 
one does not shore up the longterm foundations for 
sinoamerican relations by appearing weak to chinas leaders and 
callous to the chinese and american people he wrote 
one does not earn respect abroad by reversing field within 
months and practicing double standards he added one cannot 
maintain a balanced approach at home by submerging our values and 
disdaining congressional and public opinion 
if scowcroft expressed outrage during that first visit as the 
white house says then the chinese ignored it lord said 
on monday bush said any suggestion that his actions amounted to 
condoning the repression in china was not a good rap and its 
not true the scowcroft missions have been condemned by democrats 
as kowtowing to chinas hardliners few republicans have 
defended it 
lord argued that the approach undermined chinas closet 
moderates 
far from strengthening their hand the administration has 
robbed them of the argument that chinese repression and xenophobia 
entail costs he wrote japan europe and others will feel free 
to follow the scowcroft trail 
lord said that while censure from bush might not influence 
chinas leaders acquiescence surely reinforces their view that 
crushing their populace elicits only fleeting outcries no lasting 
repercussions 
lord was especially critical of the toast offered by scowcroft 
during the dec 8 visit he said whatever business washington most 
conduct with beijing should be done in workmanlike fashion not 
with fawning emissaries 
in the toast he said scowcroft lined up the administration 
with the beijing regime against the chinese and american people 
when he said in both our societies there are voices of those who 
seek to redirect or frustrate our cooperation we both must take 
bold measures to overcome these negative forces 
lord contrasted those words with what secretary of state james 
baker said two days later in berlin true stability requires 
governments with legitimacy governments that are based on the 
consent of the governed 
by condoning the violent suppression of popular nonviolent 
demonstrations lord said the scowcroft mission sends precisely 
the wrong signals to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
to be sure the administration would react strongly over a 
sustained period to any massacre of innocents in europe and 
gorbachev probably knows this lord wrote that is precisely 
the point what we have here is not just a double standard but 
cultural if not racial bias however unintentional and 
unconscious 
are we to believe that chinese are not like europeans that 
they never had freedom and cannot afford it now because china would 
be ungovernable and stability is crucial to economic reform

i cried said ming ling peng 17 its the ticket to 
college for most of us 
stuyvesant is nationally known for academic excellence each 
year its students reach the semifinals or better of the talent 
search which began in 1942 
we take extra courses at columbia and nyu miss peng said 
of new york university i know someone who did a physics paper he 
had been working on since eighth grade 
eileen finkelstein whose son stevens project was late said he 
was devastated at being disqualified 
why should their blood sweat and tears go down the drain 
mrs finkelstein asked these kids are the creme de la creme of 
the new york system these are 90 kids who had no control over what 
was done to them certainly rules can be changed a little bit 
were talking about childrens destinies

stubborn price increases for services kept 
consumer inflation at 04 percent last month despite a drop in 
gasoline costs the government said tuesday in a report economists 
said could discourage the federal reserve board from cutting 
interest rates 
the gain in the labor departments consumer price index 
bolstered by a 06 percent advance in the service sector showed 
that inflation is persisting despite sluggishness in housing and 
manufacturing analysts said 
novembers seasonally adjusted increase which translated into 
an annual inflation rate of 49 percent followed a brisk 05 
percent rise in october and relatively modest hikes from june 
through september 
through the first 11 months of this year consumer prices have 
risen at an annual rate of 46 percent up only slightly from the 
44 percent price gains in both 1988 and 1987 
theres no evidence that inflation is accelerating but 
theres a lot of evidence that says inflation is pretty stubborn at 
current levels said economist robert brusca of nikko 
international securities co inc 
last months price spurt slightly higher than many analysts had 
been expecting contributed to more skittishness on wall street 
where the dow jones industrial stock average fell in early trading 
before recovering later in the day 
before tuesdays report many traders had been hoping that 
federal reserve policymakers finishing a twoday closeddoor 
meeting tuesday would push interest rates down another notch 
before christmas the fed had brought rates down 025 percentage 
point in early november 
that hope had been strengthened friday when the labor 
department said wholesale prices fell 01 percent in november the 
third decline in five months but the prospects of further fed 
action were dampened by the consumer price report 
the fed could still move brusca said however i think 
theyre going to sit on the sidelines a while longer 
he and other analysts noted that the wholesale price index does 
not measure the cost of services which are being pushed up by wage 
increases resulting from a tight labor market services make up 
about 55 percent of the consumer index 
weve scarcely made any inroads on services inflation said 
economist robert g dederick of northern trust co in chicago 
the fed has a classic problem its really hard to break 
inflation down in the absence of a fullfledged recession 
the labor departments calculation of overall service costs rose 
48 percent in the six months ended in november only marginally 
better than the 51 percent gain posted in the preceding six months 
the department said in a separate report that americans average 
weekly earnings after adjusting for inflation fell 07 percent 
last month following a 06 percent rise in october the department 
attributed the decline to drops in average earnings per hour and 
average hours worked per week in addition to consumer price hikes 
in another report showing sluggishness the commerce department 
said housing starts fell 47 percent in november following a 13 
percent jump a month earlier 
leading the november advance in consumer costs was a 06 percent 
boost in food prices the steepest since may dairy products jumped 
17 percent their third consecutive sharp increase the price of 
fruits and vegetables soared 18 percent the second big gain in a 
row 
economist donald ratajczak of georgia state university said the 
rise in fruit and vegetable prices was probably temporary but 
cautioned that the dairy increase accounting for about a fourth of 
the overall food increase could persist into next year 
we slaughtered a lot of cows during the drought last year 
and it takes a while to get new cows he said 
gasoline prices fell 21 percent in november following a 09 
percent rise in october however other forms of energy were more 
expensive the index for natural gas and electricity rose 15 
percent while fuel oil edged up 02 percent following a big 25 
percent gain a month earlier overall energy prices fell 01 
percent last month 
if colderthanaverage winter weather continues energy prices 
could rise over the coming months ratajczak warned the price of 
crude oil this week topped 22 a barrel for the first time since 
april 
in other details 
the cost of medical care which has been increasing at an 85 
percent rate over the last year was up 08 percent in november in 
line with previous increases 
clothing costs edged up 01 percent in november following two 
months of steep increases that coincided with the introduction of 
fall lines 
newcar prices rose 08 percent tobacco was down 01 percent 
and entertainment costs climbed 02 percent 
before taking into account normal seasonal changes the consumer 
price index stood at 1259 in november that meant that a 
hypothetical selection of goods and services costing 100 in the 
198284 base period would have cost 12590 last month up from 
12030 a year ago

the navys top admiral criticizing lax safety

the level of effective supervision on the scene was often 
inadequate when accidents occurred adm carlisle ah trost said 
in a letter sent monday to all navy commanders 
taking safety for granted is never acceptable trost wrote 
safety springs from a command attitude and set of priorities that 
require an everyday buildingblock approach and selfdiscipline 
trosts findings stem from his evaluation of the navys 
unprecedented twoday freeze or standdown on routine operations 
last month 
trost and navy secretary h lawrence garrett iii ordered the 
pause in operations in midnovember after 10 accidents at sea and 
in the air within three weeks killed 10 navy personnel and injured 
at least 71 
under the standdown order all navy units worldwide halted 
normal routine and concentrated on safety inspections reviews and 
lectures 
afterward commanders relayed their findings to trost 
pentagon spokesman pete williams releasing a statement about 
the navys study said defense secretary dick cheney was confident 
the service would address the problems 
im sure theyll take steps to correct it williams said 
trost referred to complacency in his letter and faulted 
commanders for exercising poor supervision during the navys many 
dangerous operations he told commanders there was no single 
element to link the accidents which ranged from men washed 
overboard to plane crashes to ship fires to the accidental bombing 
of a cruiser 
trost complained that sailors had not been properly taught to do 
their jobs that supervisors lacked safety training and established 
safety procedures were not adequately followed he said those were 
all areas where improvements were needed 
the bottom line is that safety of our personnel is a 
fundamental obligation and responsibility of leadership trost 
told his commanders one life lost is an unacceptable price we 
simply must do better 
during the safety review naval commanders found problems with 
proper planning of their operations a lack of qualified senior 
leaders during operations proper 24houraday supervision and 
compressed atsea schedules that precluded proper training for 
junior personnel the pentagon statement said 
attention should be paid to the constant review of all safety 
procedures the proper use of safety publications so sailors dont 
have to constantly relearn safety procedures and the use of 
established inspections to reveal improper stowage of dangerous 
materials the statement said 
the standdown revealed that there should be increased emphasis 
on safety during all training courses improvement in the quality 
of instructors at navy schools and better use of such safety 
instruction techniques as training videotapes 
there have been 75 major accidents and 104 fatalities this year 
however that includes the 47 sailors killed in the april 19 gun 
turret explosion aboard the battleship uss iowa 
according to navy figures 1988 was the safest year on record 
with 63 fatalities in comparison there were 118 major accidents 
reported with 64 fatalities in 1984

in an age of teenage mutant ninja turtles and 
nintendo two women who started a toy company in their basement 
have created a growing business that relies on an endless source of 
entertainment a childs imagination 
phyllis brody and evelyn greenwald owners of creative art 
activities inc banked on childrens curiosity and ingenuity when 
they founded creativity for kids in 1979 
so many of the other toys are entertaining you with our 
toys rather than a child being passive they participate said 
mrs brody 53 a former social worker people go into one of the 
toy supermarkets and buy what the kids says they want from 
television ads rather than buying something that is more in line 
with the kids interests 
the idea has paid off the business has moved into a cleveland 
warehouse as sales have increased 30 to 40 percent each of the last 
five years the two cleveland heights owners say it is accurate to 
estimate that sales exceeded 2 million in 1989 though they 
decline to give specific sales figures 
the companys 40 kits contain materials to transform old boxes 
into cars or dollhouses safety pins and sequins into bracelets and 
cardboard tubes and clothespins into dolls puppets and monsters 
harry guckert publisher of playthings the new yorkbased trade 
magazine founded in 1903 for the toy industry said creativity for 
kids has carved out a special niche in the toy market 
creativity for kids is excellent guckert said we call 
them specialty retailers the two gals have researched the market 
and their company is strong there are a lot of companies in this 
differentiated market that are not 
the companys products have won seven parents choice awards a 
toy industry award for excellence 
many of the kits are just a collection of household items the 
kind of stuff parents used to assemble for play on a rainy day 
feathers glue colored paper corks paint fabric wood and yarn 
said ms greenwald 49 a lawyer she said the kits satisfy the 
needs of working parents who dont have the time to round up craft 
items but still want to offer children creative opportunities 
ten employees work at company headquarters mailing orders to 
about 1000 small toy shops nationwide that feature educational and 
specialty products 
the employees order hundreds of pounds of feathers millions of 
wiggly eyes pine cones and an array of other items the suppliers 
ship the items to a sheltered workshop program where handicapped 
workers assemble the toy kits 
aimed at children 4 and older the kits range in price from 3 
for a party favors kit to 25 for a precut doll bed the product 
line is inexpensive in an industry with annual sales of 12 billion 
the kits are a combination of facts playing and learning 
they make up their own rules no one tells them how to do it 
ms brody said 
for 795 the lets pretend travel kit includes maps 
passports postcards and tickets the lets pretend restaurant 
offers dinnerware menus placemats order pads and other items 
needed for a restaurant 
other kits include the ingredients to make a personalized 
tshirt hat or masks or items to operate a hotel or supermarket

david register rose with the sun 
tuesday and by 7 am his pickup was gleaming under a cloudless 
sky neighbor allan edwards was already spraying fertilizer and 
water on new sod patches and palm trees 
man id usually be sleeping now register 19 said as he 
hosed suds from the trucks hood 
by the dawns early light residents of southern florida 
sprinkled their lawns and scrubbed their cars under mandatory 
wateruse restrictions that limit such activities to earlymorning 
hours on certain days 
its a little inconvenience sure said edwards but the 
alternative no water is a lot worse 
the restrictions drafted in response to the regions worst 
drought in 27 years took effect monday and limit home car washing 
and lawn watering to 4 am to 8 am for the more than 4 million 
people from jupiter to key west 
residents of evennumbered addresses were allowed the wateruse 
privilege tuesday oddnumbered homes can open the tap early 
wednesday 
police and water management officials say no 25 violation fines 
were issued monday but no records were kept for firsttime 
warnings 
people have generally responded very quickly and im 
impressed with that said bruce adams water shortage coordinator 
for the south florida water management district 
in miami metrodade police detective donald blocker said 
officers will not actively seek out violators but will investigate 
complaints 
we dont have a special task force or anything he said 
well be looking into reports on a lowpriority basis 
water managers are seeking a 15 percent reduction in the nearly 
745 million gallons of water used each day in palm beach broward 
dade and monroe counties later this week officials will determine 
if the cutbacks are successful 
for the time being water officials are busy answering 
questions nearly 900 calls an hour were registered monday at the 
water management districts west palm beach office 
as of tuesday the national weather service in miami reported 
4231 inches of rain this year more than 144 inches below normal 
that compared to 4223 inches in 1962 and 4178 inches in 1961 
according to weather service records 
some sections of floridas southeast coast are 33 inches below 
normal rainfall amounts and most are off by at least 15 inches 
in addition much of the region has had record high temperatures 
in the mid to upper 80s since monday 
mandatory water restrictions have been in effect since february 
in the 16county southwest florida water management district which

an amtrak train carrying at least 144 
passengers plowed into a tractortrailer in dense fog derailed and 
exploded today killing three people and critically injuring 17 
authorities reported 
the engineer and fireman of the locomotive were killed when the 
engine careened off the tracks overturned and exploded the 
california highway patrol said the chp said the driver of the 
truck was also killed 
chp spokesman bob whitmire said 54 passengers were injured he 
said 23 seriously injured people were taken by ambulance to 
hospitals and 31 others were taken by bus to hospitals for 
examination and treatment of minor injuries 
they still are fighting the fire in the engine said ron 
baldwin of the san joaquin office of emergency services they had 
a large fire in the engine itself and were trying to get people 
out of the train in case there is an explosion 
one problem is we have heavy fog and were not able to air 
transport victims and its making it a little more complex 
amtrak spokesman arthur lloyd said the train was going about 70 
mph when it hit the truck which apparently had ignored the 
lights and went right in front of the train the train was en 
route from oakland to bakersfield 
our information is that the road crossing is protected by 
gates bells and flashing lights amtrak spokeswoman sue martin 
said at railroad heaquarters in washington we do not know why 
the truck was on the tracks we know the accident occurred id one car was 
on its side 
it was unknown whether tule fog an extremely dense wintertime 
fog that has made san joaquin valley roads dangerous in recent days 
was a factor visibility was zero at the time of the accident 
the national weather service said 
dense fog caused a 69vehicle pileup near tracy west of stockton 
monday morning and a series of accidents involved 55 vehicles 
farther south in merced county

a national research council report said 
tuesday that cancer risks from low level xray and gamma ray 
radiation are three to four times greater than earlier believed a 
finding that may lead to new standards for workers in nuclear 
industries 
however arthur c upton chairman of the nrc committee that 
made the study said the average citizen should not view this as 
a source of great concern 
upton said he expects that agencies worldwide that set industry 
radiation exposure standards will reassess the risks as a result of 
the nrc study although he said the committee did not recommend 
changes he did say i personally expect that there will be 
changes 
the committee reassessed the health effects of lowlevel 
radiation using new data developed from studies of survivors from 
the world war ii atomic bombings in japan from other irridated 
populations such as workers in atomic industries and from 
animals studies 
experts on the committee also revised previous mathematical 
methods of estimating risks from lowlevel radiation 
using the new information and methods the committee concluded 
that the risk for solid tumor cancer is three times greater than an 
earlier nrc estimate and the risk for leukemia is four times 
greater 
the committee also found a much greater danger for mental 
retardation among unborn babies exposed to lowlevel radiation in 
the eighth to 15th weeks after conception 
the committee found that women are slightly more likely than men 
to develop cancer from low levels of radiation and that in some 
types of cancer children are more susceptible to radiations 
effects than are adults 
upton who is chairman of the department of environmental 
medicine at new york university medical center said the study 
merely endorses earlier reports that we really dont know that 
there is a safe level of radiation exposure 
he emphasized that the findings should not prevent patients from 
receiving appropriate diagnostic xrays or treatments because the 
added risk from such medical radiation is very slight 
a chest xray might increase an individuals risk by 1 in a 
million he said its essentially negligible but its not 
negligible to public health authorities who analyze risks for the 
population as a whole 
unneccessary xrays however said upton should be avoided 
seymour jablon a national cancer institute scientist who was on 
the nrc committee said the bottom line is that you ought to 
avoid radiation whenever you can but there are certain benefits 
such as medical xrays that outweigh the risk 
many of the studys conclusions are based partly on the medical 
history of 76000 survivors of the 1945 atomic bombings in japan a 
factor that powerfully influenced the new cancer risk estimates 
previously the committee said neutron radiation was 
erroneously considered to have a major influence on the health of 
the abomb survivors removing neutrons from the equation it said 
means that the survivors are experiencing higher rates of cancer 
from lower radiation doses 
this is interpreted by the committee to mean that there is an 
increased risk of cancer and other health problems from lowlevel 
radiation 
dose and duration of exposure generally determine health 
effects the committee said 
in the united states for instance natural background radiation 
gives an exposure of 01 to 03 rems a year rem stands for rad 
equivalent in man and is a unit of measure used to describe a 
biological effect from a level of radiation exposure 
a routine chest xray gives an added exposure of 006 rem 
occupational standards limit nuclear workers to an annual exposure 
of no more than 5 rem 
the committee estimated that a single burst of 10 rem radiation 
exposure will result in 790 excess cancer and leukemia deaths per 
100000 people for this same exposure a 1980 national research 
council report estimated cancer deaths per 100000 people at 80 to 
230 
for a lifetime radiation exposure of 01 rem a year the new 
study estimated 520 male cancer deaths per 100000 men and 600 
deaths per 100000 women the 1980 report estimated cancer deaths 
at 25 to 119 for this rate of exposure 
the nrc which organized the committee study is the research 
arm of the national academy of sciences a congressionally 
chartered private organization that conducts research at the 
request of the government

premier nikolai i ryzhkov defeated the soviet 
congress first try at a noconfidence vote tuesday and won 
overwhelming approval for an economic revival plan based on 
traditional socialist methods of state planning 
critics say ryzhkovs plan continues the same bureaucratic 
meddling in the economy that after more than 70 years of soviet 
rule has led to widespread shortages of consumer goods the 
rationing of items ranging from meat to matches and a multibillion 
ruble state deficit 
in a dramatic kremlin showdown president mikhail s gorbachev 
interceded from the dais on behalf of his fellow politburo member 
asking for a clear pledge of support from the 2250member congress 
of peoples deputies or parliament that is the centerpiece of his 
political reforms 
its a political question will we support this government and 
what it has introduced or will we keep the government in such a 
state all the time that it cannot begin its work gorbachev 
demanded of the congress meeting in the kremlin palace of 
congresses 
ryzhkov 60 and his ministers have been a lightning rod for 
parliamentary and popular discontent since the congress and its 
smaller working legislature the supreme soviet began functioning 
this summer 
progressives say the plan presented by ryzhkov to the congress 
dec 13 is a triumph for bureaucrats and conservatives since it 
rejects more radical proposals by the premiers top economist 
leonid abalkin for selling off moneylosing state enterprises and 
urgent measures to free some prices from state controls 
although the kremlin allows its east european allies virtual 
free rein in reforming their economies ryzhkovs plan shows its 
deepseated reluctance to abandon government levers controlling its 
own economy that date to the reign of dictator josef stalin and 
earlier 
instead ryzhkovs proposals shift central planning from its 
traditional emphasis on heavy industry to consumer goods as a way 
of filling chronically empty store shelves 
yuri andreev a moscow engineer called on the congress to 
express its lack of confidence in ryzhkovs government by asking it 
to draft a new economic reform plan and to fire the officials who 
drafted the orginal version 
the normally cool and composed ryzhkov his voice cracking with 
emotion pleaded with the deputies for clearcut support the 
congress should not avoid making an evaluation he said it 
must express its firm position either to support the governments 
proposals or some other formulation 
after his appeal the noconfidence measure was voted down 1685 
to 199 with 99 abstentions a separate vote on the economic plan 
which includes emergency measures as well as guidelines for the 
199195 13th fiveyear plan was approved 1532 to 419 with 44 
deputies abstaining 
ryzhkov stood and clasped his hands in victory as members of the 
congress applauded he had hinted in a newspaper interview printed 
sunday that he would leave office if the plan were not approved 
abalkin was quoted by the official tass news agency as saying 
all members of the council of ministers that ryzhkov heads were 
ready to resign immediately if the proposal failed to win the 
congress backing 
though andreevs proposal was defeated it was the latest sign 
of feistiness by lawmakers in the gorbachev age and a stark 
contrast with the unanimous approval once given every proposal the 
kremlin leadership put to a vote 
in its afternoon session the congress showed its combativeness 
again by not giving the leadership the needed majority for a 
proposed constitutional amendment that would have continued special 
parliamentary representation for gorbachevs communist party and 
other officially sanctioned organizations 
socalled social organizations are now empowered to elect 
750 congress members with the other twothirds of the deputies 
chosen in competitive elections nationwide the organizations 
special representation has provoked discontent among deputies who 
have to go in front of voters 
the editorial commission of the congress headed by party 
ideologue vadim a medvedev proposed amending the constitution to 
say that special representatives may be elected by social 
organizations replacing the automatic guarantee of 750 congress 
seats 
that language was considered too tepid by deputies who want the 
special provision eliminated the proposed amendment received only 
1078 yes votes more than 400 short of the twothirds majority 
required for such a measure of the other deputies 810 voted 
against and 44 abstained 
at gorbachevs urging the congress also passed a decree 
instructing the supreme soviet to pass a raft of laws by february 
that are considered crucial to the kremlin leaders plans for 
economic reform 
progressives originally wanted the laws on property land 
leasing and other matters debated at the congress yuri boldyrev of 
leningrad said gorbachevs move was a tactical victory for 
reformers since conservatives in the congress could have stymied 
action on the laws but he said the decree sets a dangerous 
precedent by allowing the supreme soviet to do work that should 
be done by the congress

katie cooper a single parent on 
welfare says she had hit rock bottom a year ago before a state 
program that tied welfare benefits to her sons school attendance 
changed her life 
learnfare introduced in march 1988 aims to keep teenagers 
from welfare families in school by threatening to cut the familys 
welfare benefits when a child is truant 
the program has its critics but ms cooper isnt one of them 
her 17yearold son travis was on drugs last year and had 
missed so many days of school that the familys aid to families 
with dependent children was about to be cut 
things looked so bleak ms cooper said i thought how 
the hell was i gonna pay the bills 
afdc benefits in wisconsin range from 249 to 983 a month 
depending on the familys size learnfare cuts those benefits by 
20 to 192 a month for each month a familys child or children 
fail to regularly attend school food stamps and other public 
assistance programs are not affected 
the threat of losing part of their benefits forced ms cooper 
and her son to change their ways 
travis a senior has improved his grades from fs to cs and 
will graduate in may 
although learnfare didnt make travis love school it kept him 
there ms cooper said thats whats important 
and ms cooper who battled drug addiction and an abusive 
marriage before setting out on her own 11 years ago has attended a 
twoyear college while working part time as a waitress and will 
receive a degree in marketing this month 
about 2200 of the estimated 30000 teenagers whose families 
receive afdc have been penalized each month 
critics claim the threat of losing benefits gives troublesome 
teenagers a tool by which to hold their parents hostage 
it forces families and children to lie to commit fraud for 
the money they need to live on it keeps people in that vicious 
circle said geneva johnson president of family service america 
a milwaukeebased social service organization 
supporters however argue education is the first step to 
breaking the cycle of welfare dependency and that learnfare is a 
strong tool to encourage students to get an education 
patricia goodrich secretary of the state department of health 
and social services which oversees learnfare said the program has 
brought to the attention of afdc recipients that education is 
important 
the state has applied to the us department of health and human 
services to expand the program to include children in elementary 
school 
dorthea harrington a program manager for the federal agencys 
regional office in chicago said no decision has been made on the 
application and that the government has not yet evaluated learnfare 
nancy campbell a branch chief for health and human services in 
washington said no other state has asked permission to implement 
learnfare although some have expressed an interest 
she said ohio has enacted a program somewhat similar to 
learnfare but that program uses incentive payments rather than 
benefit cuts to encourage welfare recipients to stay in school 
in wisconsin schools are given lists of children whose families 
receive afdc and they notify mrs goodrichs agency when one of 
those students has three or more unexcused absences in a month 
the agency warns the family benefits will be cut for the next 
month and the deduction is made if the family does not appeal 
families may appeal on the grounds that there were extenuating 
circumstances for the absences that the cuts will cause undue 
hardship on the family or that attendance records were incorrect 
legal action of wisconsin inc of milwaukee a legal advocacy 
group recently filed suit challenging learnfares 
constitutionality it has handled appeals for about 200 to 250 
families and won about 75 percent of the cases 
patricia delessio an attorney for the group said one criticism 
of the program is that the welfare cuts do nothing to meet the 
needs of troubled students who miss school 
school officials dont sit down with the teenagers and find 
out what the problem is and try to provide services to meet their 
needs she said 
mrs goodrich said efforts to investigate the reasons for 
truancy are part of the proposal to expand learnfare 
theres a concern that theres a real reason for the majority 
of these youngsters missing school she said

prince charles used shakespeares hamlet to 
illustrate the decline of the english language into what he called 
impoverished sloppy banalities and cliches 
the prince said english had been the medium for some of the 
greatest literature in the world including that of william 
shakespeare whom he called probably the greatest playwright that 
ever lived 
but the state of modern english led the prince to wonder how 
shakespeares hamlet would have delivered his famous to be or 
not to be soliloquy in todays language 
this is what hamlet says in act iii scene 1 of the play 
hamlet prince of denmark 
to be or not to be that is the question 
whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer 
the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune 
or to take arms against a sea of troubles 
and by opposing end them to die to sleep 
no more and by a sleep to say we end 
the heartache and the thousand natural shocks 
that flesh is heir to tis a consummation 
devoutly to be wishd to die to sleep 
to sleep perchance to dream ay theres the rub 
for in that sleep of death what dreams may come 
when we have shuffled off this mortal coil 
must give us pause 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
here is prince charles version of how the soliloquy would be 
written in todays english 
well frankly the problem as i see it 
at this moment in time is whether i 
should just lie down under all this hassle 
and let them walk all over me 
or whether i should just say ok 
i get the message and do myself in 
i mean lets face it im in a nowin 
situation and quite honestly 
im so stuffed up to here with the whole 
stupid mess that i can tell you ive just 
got a good mind to take the quick way out 
thats the bottom line the only problem is 
what happens if i find that when ive bumped 
myself off theres some kind of a you know 
all that mystical stuff about when you die 
you might find youre still know what i mean

they spent months and years toiling in 
laboratories and stuffy libraries but when it came time to get 
their projects to the nations top science fair 90 high school 
students were a day late 
under contest rules the science papers absolutely positively 
had to be in washington dc by midnight friday but because of 
a federal express error the papers from 90 students at new yorks 
stuyvesant high school arrived monday 
the students were disqualified from the westinghouse science 
talent search until westinghouse executives in pittsburgh 
intervened 
it just wasnt fair so were going to admit them said 
charles carroll a westinghouse spokesman we asked ourselves 
whats the right thing to do disqualification seemed like an 
unfair penalty 
were elated said stuyvesant assistant principal harold 
lehrman after i got the call the news spread through the school 
like wildfire everyone was cheering 
that included leland gershell who spent the last 18 months 
designing and performing an experiment that linked the fluoride 
content of dental patients saliva with their susceptibility to 
cavities 
for a while gershell was afraid his work he pored over dozens 
of scholarly journals and collected and analyzed dozens of vials of 
patients drool had been in vain 
a stuyvesant teacher sent two boxes to the westinghouse 
competition in washington last thursday one box containing about 
70 papers arrived the next day just before the deadline but the 
second box mailed at the same time and same place arrived three 
days later to be rejected and sent back to new york 
federal express admitted it misrouted the box and sent 
westinghouse an affidavit to that effect but carol luszcz program 
director said that made no difference 
competition applications warn that a postmark of dec 15 will 
not suffice and packages sent via a guaranteed delivery service 
will be refused if they arrive after the deadline there also is 
an underlined warning late entries will be disqualified without 
exception and a recommendation that applicants allow for the 
holiday mail crush 
ever year we get papers late but we just cant take them 
whether its the applicants fault or the mails fault or gods 
fault ms luszcz said before she was overruled by the 
westinghouse educational foundation which pays for the competition 
one year she said about 30 applicants were rejected even 
though their applications were delayed by a blizzard in the midwest 
carroll speaking by telephone from pittsburgh said that what 
set stuyvesant apart was what he termed the twin boxes they 
were sent out together so it was decided to treat them as one 
ms luszcz said the deadline was important because competition 
judges begin reading the papers in washington almost immediately 
after the deadline and that equity required that similar papers be 
read by the same judges 
carroll said the judges would be reconvened to consider the 90 
stuyvesant papers 
the westinghouse competition is the ultimate high school science 
fair the ranks of winners include five nobel laureates eight 
macarthur fellows and two winners of the field medal the top prize 
in mathematics 
of the 1900 scholarships awarded since 1942 new york city 
students have won roughly a quarter stuyvesant students are

the government and international monetary 
fund on tuesday finished drafting a letter of intent on an economic 
adjustment plan leading to 700 million in standby loans to poland 
a finance ministry official said 
the letter should be signed after it is reviewed by senior 
government officials said deputy finance minister janusz sawicki 
dismissing suggestions that a delay had arisen 
there are no disappointments i can say it is going on 
schedule sawicki said of course you could always wish for 
miracles 
an imf mission headed by european department head massimo russo 
left poland on tuesday after completing the agreement that requires 
poland to embark on tough economic reforms to get the imf credits 
there was no reason to initial the letter right away said 
sawicki who took part in the negotiations on the polish side 
asked whether the imf aid will arrive in time to assist poland 
as it undertakes economic reform scheduled to begin jan 1 sawicki 
said several western countries probably would offer a bridge loan 
in the interim before the first imf installment arrives 
he said he also hoped a 1 billion stabilization loan being 
prepared by western countries to back the polish currency would be 
ready early next year 
every hour is now being counted he said 
the letter of intent is to be reviewed by senior members of the 
solidarityled government of prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
before its signing sawicki said after it is signed it is to be 
sent to imf managing director michel camdessus and the imf board of 
executive directors in washington 
deputy prime minister leszek balcerowicz and polish national 
bank president wladyslaw baka will sign the letter for the polish 
side the state pap news agency reported 
the agreement which mazowieckis government has been 
negotiating since it took office in september is tied to the 
sweeping economic reform program that the governent introduced in 
parliament sunday 
it calls for strict measures to balance the budget decontrol 
prices limit wages break monopolies introduce partial 
convertibility of the zloty and privatize state industries 
the agreement will certify to western leaders that poland is 
making serious efforts to put its economy in order and is expected 
to result immediately in 300 million in world bank loans and about 
3 billion in other western aid 
the holders of polands 40 billion western debt also are 
expected to agree to rescheduling part of that debt 
the progress in talks with the imf came on the third day of a 
parliament debate concerning the radical economic reform program 
balcerowicz submitted sunday 
for the second straight day the debate was dominated by 
deputies from rural areas complaining the budget does not do enough 
to help farmers obtain agricultural inputs such as farm machinery 
pesticides and fertilizers and that the government should set 
minimum prices for farm produce 
agriculture minister czeslaw janicki said he sympathized with 
many of the complaints about lack of government funds for 
agriculture but he said that the states finances would not allow 
anymore at present 
it is impossible to do everything overnight he said 
as the sejm or lower house of parliament debated throughout 
the day a 43member extraordinary commission set up to review the 
governments economic package was meeting behind closed doors 
deputies said the commission would be doing much of the real 
work on analyzing the package which would then be put to a vote of 
the full sejm sometime after christmas

promised during the campaign said luis inacio lula da silva 
he will govern in favor of big business the armed forces and the 
international monetary fund da silva said his workers party and 
other leftwing parties that backed him will form a shadow 
government to prevent collor de mello from commiting abuses 
collor de mello has refused to make a victory speech until the 
winner is officially announced by the superior electoral court 
that is expected wednesday 
with 939 percent of the vote counted official returns showed 
collor de mello with 32884545 votes or 437 percent and da 
silva with 29975927 votes or 389 percent 
officials said the remaining ballots were blank or improperly 
filled out and considered null 
the presidentelect is anxious to speak to the nation but he 
will only do so when the elecotral court confirms his victory 
said claudio humberto rosa e silva collor de mellos press 
spokesman 
leaders of collor de mellos 10monthold national 
reconstruction party met with outgoing president jose sarneys 
economic ministers and began negotiating alliances with political 
leaders 
the rightist party with less than 3 percent of seats in 
congress lacks legislative weight needed to take emergency 
measures to revive the economy brazils annual inflation rate is 
1500 percent and its 110 billion foreign debt is the biggest in 
the third world 
we are going to form a government of national unity excluding

communication with the liberal wing of the roman catholic church 
unions and leftist parties that backed da silva 
workers party officials appeared to reject any offer of 
conciliation 
mr collor de mello has a program and suporters that conflict 
with our program and with the way of handling politics in brazil 
said party president luiz gushiken theres no sense in us 
joining a collor government 
meanwhile sarney said he would step down from office early if 
congress votes to shorten his fiveyear mandate 
if the congress wishes i wont be an obstacle said sarney 
a civilian who took office in 1985 in an electoral college vote 
coordinated by the countrys top generals 
the presidentelect is scheduled to succeed sarney for a 
fiveyear term march 15 1990 but pressure is mounting for sarney 
to resign early on sunday two cabinet ministers said the new 
president should take office soon to adopt economic measures 
the election sunday marked the return of democratic rights after 
a rightwing miltiary regime ruled from 1964 to 1985 
the 82 millionmember electorate also passed judgment on two 
decades of rapid but unequal growth which led to the economic 
problems 
collor de mello and da silva were the top votegetters in a 
field of 21 candidates in firstround balloting nov 15 neither 
obtained a majority needed to win and the two went to a runoff 
election

foreign debt land and urban reforms and redistribution of wealth

the energy department gave the new operator of 
the savannah river nuclear weapons plant 39 million in award fees 
despite serious safety lapses such as workers found sleeping on 
duty the agency said tuesday 
the award for westinghouse savannah river cos first six months 
at the site near aiken sc amounted to 525 percent of the 
maximum possible award under terms of its contract the department 
said in a letter to westinghouse last wednesday 
the contract provides for incentive payments or award fees if 
the contractor meets criteria set by the department 
westinghouse took over for ei du pont de nemours amp co in 
april amid concern that du pont had allowed safety standards to 
fall dangerously low du pont had run the plant since it was built 
in the early 1950s 
in the letter pw kaspar manager of the departments savannah 
river operations office told westinghouse savannah river president 
james moore that while the company had made some important 
improvements its overall approach to instilling greater discipline 
in plant operations was too narrow and not yet effective 
kaspar said the departments award fee board which evaluated 
westinghouses performance from april 1 through sept 30 had 
assigned a rating of 82 points out of a possible 100 kaspar 
personally knocked one point off the rating resulting in an award 
total of 39 million out of a maximum possible 75 million 
the reason for this reduction was my assessment that progress 
made to date on improving conduct of operations is inadequate and 
not sufficiently reflected in the boards evaluation kaspar 
wrote 
while training programs appear to be sound there is 
insufficient onshift coaching rigorous enforcement of details and 
followup of anomalies throughout the site he added 
among the anomalies cited by kaspar was employees found sleeping 
on the job 
kaspars letter provided no details but plant spokesman dean 
hoffman said tuesday that two employees in separate incidents had 
been found asleep when they were supposed to have been monitoring 
the testing of cooling pipes at the l reactor one of three 
reactors at savannah river that make a gas needed for nuclear 
warheads 
all three reactors have been shut down for more than a year for 
safety improvements 
hoffman said unspecified disciplinary action was taken 
against the employees several months ago although they were not 
fired 
kaspar attributed the sleeping incidents to excessive overtime 
required by westinghouse 
another problem noted by kaspar was the intentional disablement 
of alarms by westinghouse employees 
hoffman said two employees recently were fired for tampering 
with alarms in two areas of the plant including the p reactor the 
alarms were installed to detect excessive amounts of radiation 
hoffman called the sleeping and alarm tampering isolated 
incidents and said the company had made important strides toward 
reaching energy department standards for operating the plant he 
added that the company would not be satisfied with its overall 
performance until it reached the departments highest standards 
hoffman noted that the department had given westinghouse an 
excellent rating for establishing and operating an integrated 
design engineering and construction organization ratings in other 
areas were either good or marginal

the coast guards failure to require life 
rafts and signal beacons on small commercial passenger boats 
contributed to the loss of life in the sinking of a vessel off the 
oregon coast the national transportation safety board concluded 
tuesday 
it was the first time the board has cited what it considers a 
laxity in coast guard regulations as a contributory cause to an 
accident it investigated 
the board on a 30 vote with one member absent placed primary 
blame for the accident on the vessels captain who was not 
identified 
the board also blamed the coast guard for failing in its 
inspections to confirm whether hatchcovers on the 46foot cougar 
were watertight before the sept 15 1988 sinking which led to 
the deaths of the boats captain a deckhand and two passengers 
one died 15 minutes before a helicopter rescued a ships mate 
and the boats four remaining passengers who had floated in the 
cold water 35 miles west of depoe bay for 18 hours investigators 
said 
the board said the cougars captain had failed to ensure that 
hatchcovers were watertight that the bilge pump was operating 
properly and that rubber flaps designed to let water flow off the 
deck were correctly installed 
the flaps were on the wrong side preventing water from flowing 
off the deck investigators said the ship sank in moderately heavy 
seas while returning from a fishing trip after its crew and 
passengers tried for 90 minutes to bail out the ship with buckets 
the board estimates that more than 4700 commercial vessels 
capable of carrying 300000 passengers fall under the same 
regulations as the cougar 
the board for years has recommended that the coast guard require 
all commercial boats to carry lifeboats that will keep all 
passengers and crew out of the water if the ship sinks and that 
emergency positonindicating radio beacons or epribs be carried 
on all vessels so they can be quickly located by searchers 
in the last five years the board has investigated five 
passenger vessel accidents including two collisions one fire one 
capsizing and one grounding in each case coast guard survival 
craft requirements were found inadequate but there has been no 
change 
the board recommended that the coast guard require that within 
five years all floation devices and buoyant apparatus be replaced 
by lifeboats life rafts or inflatable devices that can keep people 
out of the water 
the problem is that floatation devices require that passengers 
remain in the water where they can suffer from a rapid loss of 
body heat or hypothermia 
the board also advised the coast guard to improve its testing 
rules and procedures and to require all passenger vessel operators 
to file sailing plans before they set out

the united states on tuesday condemned the 
violent suppression of political dissent in romania saying the 
bush administration is reviewing its already limited relationship 
with the hardline east bloc country 
we call upon the romanian government to cease these outrageous 
policies and allow its citizens freely to exercise their 
fundamental human rights state department spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler said reading an official statement denouncing the 
brutal use of security forces against the people of timisoara 
the extent of the weekend violence in timisoara a city 500 
miles west of bucharest was difficult to determine because the 
government was apparently suppressing news of the events she said 
two us embassy officials have been sent from bucharest to try 
to get firsthand information she said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater also harshly criticized 
the romanian government 
the demonstrations in timisoara and elsewhere were a result of 
the systematic denial of human rights to the people of romania 
particularly to members of the hungarian minority fitzwater said 
tuesday 
the repressive measures undertaken by the romanian government 
are totally unjustified and stand in stark contrast to the positive 
changes taking place elsewhere in eastern europe he said 
ms tutwiler said us ambassador alan green will await the 
report from the embassy officials and the return of leader nicolae 
ceaucescu from an official trip to iran before deciding whether to 
file an official diplomatic protest 
the demonstrations were an obvious manifestation of broad 
popular discontent with the policies of the romanian government and 
a clear expression of the romanian peoples desire to join their 
neighbors in embracing democratic reform and economic freedom 
the state department statement said 
it is sadly regrettable that romania remains the only warsaw 
pact country to reject all political and economic reforms as 
well as the only signatory to the helsinki human rights accord to 
refuse to acknowledge the commitments it made under that agreement 
ms tutwiler said 
she said international borders and the bucharest airport have 
been closed to foreign visitors and all international telephone 
lines into romania were getting busy signals 
the few us citizens in timisoara known to the embassy are 
safe she said 
the united states ms tutwiler said is coordinating its 
response to the romanian crackdown with nato and european economic 
community allies 
i can tell you we are currently reassessing our bilateral 
relationship including economic scientific and other areas to 
determine if there are other actions which can be meaningfully 
taken she said 
us trade with romania has declined by half since 1988 when it 
renounced mostfavorednation status to get out from under us 
freedomofemigration requirements the status imposes the only 
trade remaining is about 300 million annually primarily imports 
of romanian refined petroleum products 
our relations have deteriorated seriously since then ms 
tutwiler said

lithuanias communist party leader 
tuesday urged a united political front with other parties to press 
for sovereignty and protect the baltic republic from kremlin 
pressure 
algirdas brazauskas in an address to more than 1000 delegates 
at the opening session of the lithuanian communist party congress 
avoided calling for an immediate direct break with the soviet 
communist party or for lithuanian indepenence but he left open 
both possibilities 
lithuania he said saw itself as part a union of soviet 
republics undergoing a radical transformation under president 
mikhail s gorbachevs reforms that will allow us to build a 
soviet union from which we can secede if we wanted to 
gorbachev has spoken out against plans to split the lithuanian 
party from the national communist party and to restore the 
independent lithuanian state that existed between the world wars 
but the lithuanians have continued to press for more autonomy and 
an initial step dec 7 removed constitutional language that made 
the communist party the leading force in society 
the national congress of peoples deputies last week refused to 
discuss such a move but communist parties in eastern europe 
already have given up that special status as change sweeps the 
region 
brazauskas told the delegates in a nearly 1hour speech only 
with an independent communist party is it possible to compete 
normally and on an equal footing with oher political forces 
political power is achieved only through democratic 
elections he added 
romas gudaitis a lithuanian writer said separation was 
justified because the soviet commuinist party is still mired in 
stalinism 
brazauskas said the lithuanian party freed from its 
subordination to moscow was prepared to cooperate with the 
powerful political movement sajudis and other parties in a united 
front to govern the republic of 37 million people 
practically all parties in lithuania today proclaim the same 
or practically the same goals he said 
those newly formed parties include the social democrats and a 
party advocating outright independence from the soviet union 
a united front if it became truly united and consolidated 
lithuania would be a good counterbalance to any attempts from 
outside to restrict our achievments he said in an obvious 
reference to fears that moscow might try to limit lithuanias drive 
for sovereignty 
progressive communist leaders in lithuania and the other baltic 
republics of latvia and estonia are already closely identified 
with sajudis and other peoples fronts organizations but 
brazauskas proposal was to extend and formalize that relationship 
apparently to make the communist party a coalition partner 
arvydas juozaitis a member of the sajudis governing council 
told reporters that sajudis was not interested in a united front 
im not sure they are absolutely acceptable to us under this 
name he said 
the communist party regardless of what decision it makes at 
this weeks congress is nearly dead he said they are reburying 
a dead body in another grave from a soviet grave to a national 
grave he said 
juozaitis added however that it was very possible the 
lithuanian communist party would soon change its name 
lithuanian leaders have said they needed to compete in feb 24 
local elections and that requires them to develop a program 
independent of moscow 
many local communist leaders in march were beaten badly in 
elections to the national congress of peoples deputies because 
they were too closely identified with decades of moscows 
heavyhanded policies 
although the partys proposed rules do not mention any firm 
relationship with the soviet party brazauskas vowed their would be 
no immediate break with it 
the declaration and legitimization of the statutes of the 
independent lithuanian communist party does not mean breaking off 
the relationship with the soviet communist but reshaping it and 
making a transition from subordination to partnership the 
party said in a draft document 
outside hundreds of people gathered on the steps of the opera 
and ballet theater where the congress was being held they carried 
red green and yellow lithuanian flags and banners backing the 
partys proposed independence from moscow 
a small group of demonstrators marched down gediminas avenue 
the main street to protest even a reformed communist party one 
sign proclaimed stop communism in lithuania with the word 
communism painted red to simulate dripping blood 
the congress is to last most of the week and observers expect a 
vote on the partys status to take place wednesday or thursday 
juozaitis said he thought latvia estonia georgia and armenia 
soon might follow the lead of the lithuanian party in separating 
from the national organization strengthening lithuanias hand in 
dealing with gorbachev

the nations dominant longdistance telephone 
company the american telephone amp telegraph co announced tuesday 
that it will cut basic daytime interstate rates an average of 13 
percent jan 1 evening rates will drop an average of 20 percent 
atampt spokesman herb linnen said the reductions were necessary 
under changes earlier this year in the federal communications 
commissions regulation of longdistance charges 
the fcc now imposes caps on atampts longdistance rates based on 
the companys longdistance expenses as opposed to a preset rate 
of return 
atampt said the lowered rates reflect reduced expenses mainly 
from reduced fees that atampt will pay in 1990 to local telephone 
companies for access to local exchanges 
john hauser a spokesman for atampts principal competitor mci 
communications corp said mci would also pass on savings in local 
telephone company access charges we will remain competitive with 
them he said 
hausers counterpart at us sprint robin pence said we are 
reviewing the filing and we intend to remain competitive 
atampt says it has about 70 percent of the longdistance market 
as measured by interstate and intrastate revenues mci is no 2 
with more than 10 percent us sprint claims 7 to 8 percent 
in filing notice with the fcc of its intent to lower rates atampt 
estimated that the reductions would save customers 300 million a 
year on interstate and international longdistance services used 
primarily by residential and small business customers 
a 10minute atampt call during daytime hours on a weekday to 
anywhere in the united states will cost 250 or less an average 
decrease of 13 percent 
linnen said a 10minute daytime call from washington to new 
york which now costs 230 would decline to 220 a drop of 43 
percent an evening call from washington to san francisco los 
angeles or dallas which now costs 167 for 10 minutes would drop 
53 percent to 158 many of the reductions would be less for 
other calls 
the mondayfriday day calling period is 8 am to 5 pm 
local time the evening period is 5 pm to 11 pm sunday 
through friday 
the night calling period for which rates will not change 
is from 11 pm to 8 am sunday through friday weekend 
calling rates identical to the night rates and also unaffected 
are in effect all day saturday and until 5 pm sunday 
international calls from the 48 contiguous states to 25 of the

a police bomb squad today disarmed a parcel 
bomb found at the jacksonville fla office of the naacp the 
latest discovery in a rash of mail bombings in the south that have 
claimed two lives authorities said 
it was designed to kill the individual that opened this 
package or anyone else standing in the area said jacksonville 
sheriff jim mcmillan 
the building was evacuated and the bomb which arrived in the 
mail monday but was left unopened was disarmed by disconnecting 
the battery from the explosive officials said 
it had a great similarity in the packaging to the other 
bombs said willi ellison of the us bureau of alcohol tobacco 
and firearms it was addressed to no one specifically but to the 
legal staff of the naacp 
the bomb was to be taken to an fbi laboratory in washington and 
compared with the other devices he said 
fbi director william sessions said in washington that 
investigators were looking into race as a possible motive noting 
that the incidents involved federal judges who have heard cases 
involving racial matters the naacp and a black civil rights 
activist 
under questioning sessions told a justice department news 
conference that more than one person might be involved in the 
bombings which have killed a federal judge and a civil rights 
lawyer 
the parcel bomb that killed the lawyer in savannah had been 
packed with nails suggesting another link to the bomb that killed 
the judge and another bomb authorities said 
in alabama police xrayed a package left on the doorstep of a 
birmingham city councilman who was friends with the slain judge 
but concluded it was probably an innocent mailing this is one of 
many screening processes well probably be going through because of 
the situation said fbi agent allen whitaker 
the fbi meanwhile warned judges lawyers and naacp activists 
to beware of strange packages saying white supremacists might be 
behind the attacks 
robert robinson a 42yearold black lawyer and city alderman 
was fatally injured in his law office monday night hours after 
police removed an explosive device delivered to the 11th us 
circuit court of appeals in atlanta and two days after a mail bomb 
killed 11th circuit judge robert s vance 
theres a strong similarity in the three explosive devices 
and it appears there is a relationship fbi agent tom moore said 
in birmingham ala 
officials said the bomb that killed vance on saturday hurled 
nails when it exploded the atlanta constitution today quoted 
unidentified authorities as saying the atlanta bomb contained nails 
as well and savannah mayor john rousakis said today we believed 
nails were part of this bomb also and that has been confirmed 
robinson represented the naacp in a longrunning desegregation 
lawsuit involving savannah schools and the 11th circuit which 
handles appeals for georgia alabama and florida had recently 
ruled in that case 
federal marshals said the nine judges in the 11th circuit were 
being given roundtheclock protection 
in washington a government source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the bomb that killed vance bore the return address 
of a second judge who regularly sent vance packages the second 
judge lewis f morgan also of the 11th circuit is not a suspect 
in the case but the discovery means the killer knew a great deal 
about vances personal habits and friendships the source added 
fbi agent bob deloach said monday that authorities were 
following several leads but that it was possible white supremacists 
sent the bomb that killed robinson 
ive been here three years and cant recall white 
supremacists but who knows what goes on in peoples minds and why 
theyd start now deloach asked were definitely looking into 
that but everything else too 
former alabama ku klux klan leader don black who now lives in 
south florida said there are disgruntled members of the white 
supremacist movement who believe the legal system works against the 
white majority 
they believe the only solution is direct attacks illegal 
acts on the system black said when that first bombing 
happened saturday it occurred to me it might not be colombian drug 
smugglers 
deloach and fbi agent william henshaw said the fbi was warning 
lawyers judges and activists with the national association for the 
advancement of colored people to look over their mail carefully 
henshaw said the naacp southeast regional headquarters in 
atlanta also had been warned because the bombs appeared to be 
related to a aug 22 1989 teargas mail bomb that exploded at the 
atlanta office injuring eight people that case is still being 
investigated 
earl shinhoster the naacp regional director said he had talked 
with the fbi and needless to say it was a wideranging 
discussion 
shinhoster also said he hadnt ruled out the possibility that 
white supremacists were responsible for the bombings especially 
now since various groups are much more zealous in their 
particular ideological pursuits 
morris dees head of the southern poverty law center said the 
fbi had warned him to take precautions 
the fbi contacted me as a routine matter because they 
suspect it was a possibility that white supremacists were involved 
in the bombings he said and as a precautionary measure 
because of my past involvement wanted to warn me

plan which was put into place voluntarily by the school system 
last fall 
vance 58 was not on the threejudge panel that ruled in the 
case but did serve on a panel that had cleared the way for 
prosecution of a case against the ku klux klan

ruling that had thrown out evidence critical to the prosecution of 
10 klansmen in a bloody may 1979 confrontation with black civil 
rights marchers in decatur ala that wounded four people 
authorities said the atlanta bomb was in a mailed package 
addressed to the 11th circuit courthouse but not to a specific 
individual unlike the bomb that killed vance employees were 
evacuated from the fivestory downtown building monday morning 
police safely disarmed the bomb

leaders of east and west were united 
tuesday in denouncing romanias stalinist regime for the bloody 
repression of protesters 
some reports said hundreds of people were killed when romanian 
security forces opened fire over the weekend on demonstrators 
protesting the harsh rule of president nicolae ceausescu the last 
autocrat in the soviet bloc 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze of the soviet union said 
that if the reports of bloodshed were true i can only express 
my very profound regret we are categorically opposed to the use of 
force 
shevardnadze was at a meeting of about 200 members of the 
european parliament in brussels 
there was no comment in beijing where the chinese government 
crushed a peaceful prodemocracy movement with tanks on june 45 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the repressive measures undertaken by the romanian government are 
totally unjustified and stand in stark contrast to the positive 
changes taking place elsewhere in eastern europe 
a minister in the british foreign office william waldegrave 
warned romanian officials of what may lie ahead 
those in the security services those working for the state 
should recognize that a day of reckoning will come for them as it 
has come for the east germans and others he said the right 
thing for them to do is to represent the true will of the 
romanian people and put an end to this regime 
stan soare the romanian ambassador was summoned to receive a 
protest expressed in the strongest possible terms a british 
government spokesman said and responded by resorting to the 
tired old formula of alleging interference in romanias internal 
affairs 
in its first protest to another member of the soviet bloc 
bulgaria expressed serious concern to the romanian embassy in 
sofia over the closing of the frontier 
romania closed its borders monday allowing passage only to 
diplomats and other officials 
foreign ministers of the 12 european community nations denounced 
the violence and several governments lodged official protests with 
romanian diplomats 
a statement by the 12 foreign ministers issued in brussels said 
ceausescus regime was turning its back on all the commitments 
concerning human rights to which it has subscribed in the 1975 
helsinki agreements on human rights 
ceausescu is capable only of repressing by force the 
legitimate aspirations of the romanian people to freedom they 
said 
thousands of exiled romanians were said to be planning a rally 
thursday in london 
in prague the czechoslovak foreign ministry said we 
resolutely protest the use of army and police against 
demonstrators 
vaclav havel the opposition leader and presidential candidate 
said to reporters when and if we have greater influence on 
czechoslovakias foreign policy well be able to do more for 
romanians and hungarians in romania who are being killed by this 
terrible draculalike person 
a statement from civic forum havels opposition group said 
czechoslovkia was learning with horror of the brutal 
intervention and was deeply shaken 
polands parliament passed a resolution saying romanian 
authorities used force with exceptional brutality even children 
were the targets of shooting 
austrias foreign ministry said its protest of catastrophic 
human rights practice in romania was rejected by the romanian 
charge daffaires marian radu who also was unwilling to give 
expedient information verbally on the situation in romania 
in neighboring hungary feelings ran high because up to 17 
million ethnic hungarians live in transylvania the area of western 
romania where the violence occurred 
premier miklos nemeth said anachronistic regimes opposed to 
progress cannot remain in place if europe is to be united 
nepszabadsag the official party of the socialist formerly 
communist party said history has already witnessed the reign 
of regimes not so long ago that showed off their strength with 
tanks before being overthrown by the rage of the people

ukrainian catholic church officials said tuesday 
that at least 100 russian orthodox priests and 200 parishes in the 
ukraine have registered as catholics since the ukrainian government 
first recognized the church dec 1 
the ukrainian church officials based in rome said the orthodox 
parishes that shifted to catholicism are near lvov in the western 
ukraine the officials said figures for the rest of the ukraine are 
not yet available 
according to western estimates there are 4 to 6 million 
catholics in the ukraine soviet leader josef stalin suppressed 
their church in 1946 forcing them to convert to russian orthodox 
or to practice their religion clandestinely 
however on dec 1 ukrainian authorities announced they would 
allow catholic congregations to register like other groups 
romebased cardinal myroslav lubachivsky called it a first step 
toward complete legalization 
the russian orthodox have opposed legalization of the ukrainian 
catholic church as they stand to lose hundreds of churches and 
thousands of followers they gained after the 1946 repression 
the decision to allow catholic congregations to register was 
announced as pope john paul ii held talks with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev at the vatican where the pope appealed to 
gorbachev to assure full religious freedom for catholics in the 
soviet union

cuts in us military spending in response to 
a waning soviet threat will create economic problems in 
defenseoriented regions but a group of economists said tuesday 
that federal subsidies arent the answer 
major federal spending to support particular regions is 
counterproductive to the economy donald h straszheim chief 
economist at merrill lynch capital markets told congress joint 
economic committee 
regional interests overwhelming the national interest is part 
of the problem not part of the solution he said 
defense secretary dick cheney is considering cuts in the armed 
forces and cancellation or lengthening weapons programs as part of 
an effort to reduce the defense budget 
last month cheney directed the services to come up with between 
140 billion and 180 billion in cuts from the fiscal 1992 to 1994 
military budgets 
straszheim and two other economists testifying before the 
committee which is examining the economic adjustment after the 
cold war said cuts in military spending will affect defense 
contractors nationwide however they said financial assistance 
from washington and a national job retraining program should not be 
options 
pressed by rep james scheuer dny straszheim said that 
although the approach was a cold hard position of doing 
nothing he would not suggest a wideranging program to help 
areas that might be financially strapped 
a few years ago texas was devastated when oil prices went up 
and then down thats life straszheim said 
scheuer whose district includes parts of new york city and long 
island wondered about grumman corp the long island manufacturer 
of the navys f14d tomcat jet fighter 
cheney in the fiscal 1990 defense budget proposed canceling 
the program congress agreed to continue it for one more year but 
forced grumman to sign an agreement that included a termination 
clause 
grumman sits over that long island economy like a 600pound 
canary scheuer said what do we do about the 10000 employees 
at risk what do we do about the long island economy do we have a 
retraining program 
other hard hit areas that rely heavily on defense business 
include san antonio san diego and the tidewater region of virginia 
charles l schultze director of the economic studies program at 
the brookings institution said the adjustment from cuts in defense 
would be no different from changes that occur every year across the 
nation in other businesses 
this isnt a big deal schultze said

a federal judge tuesday placed strict limits 
on the prosecutions use of oliver l north as a witness in the 
irancontra trial of former national security adviser john 
poindexter 
us district court judge harold greene said prosecutors may 
only elicit evidence from north based on statements he made 
before july 15 1987 the day poindexter began testifying on 
capitol hill before a national television audience 
the restriction means the government is unable to use most of 
the testimony north gave at his own trial last april during which 
he frequently mentioned poindexter his former white house boss 
however prosecutors will be allowed to elicit evidence from 
north based on his testimony to congress which he gave prior to 
poindexters testimony said the judge the government also will be 
permitted to delve into subjects to which poindexter did not 
testify 
poindexters trial is scheduled to begin jan 22 on charges of 
conspiracy two counts of obstructing congress and two counts of 
making false statements 
at a pretrial hearing last week north repeatedly said he was 
unable to separate in his mind his own experiences in the 
irancontra affair from what he learned by watching and reading 
poindexters testimony 
the judge was openly skeptical of norths contention but said 
he would accept the assertion in order to protect poindexters 
rights 
the court takes norths alleged inability to differentiate 
with a grain of salt said greene it seems unlikely that a 
witness who was a major and active participant in the events 
themselves would be unable to distinguish between the version of 
events described in anothers testimony 
the courts obligations however require it to err on the 
side of protecting poindexters constitutional right not to be 
convicted with the use of his own testimony said the judge 
greene denied poindexters motion to dismiss the indictment on 
grounds that it had been tainted by his congressional testimony 
which he gave under a guarantee that it would not be used against 
him in court 
the court is confident that the governments trial witnesses 
will testify from knowledge that is independent of the information 
elicited from poindexter at the congressional hearings said the 
judge 
greene also allowed irancontra prosecutors dan webb and howard 
pearl to remain in the case rejecting assertions by poindexter 
that they had been tainted by exposure to his congressional 
testimony greene said neither prosecutor has any recollection of 
the contents of poindexters testimony and therefore could make no 
use of it 
a 1972 supreme court ruling says the prosecution must derive all 
its evidence in a case from sources wholly independent of testimony 
a defendant gave under a grant of immunity 
greenes ruling means north will be limited in his testimony 
about a presidential finding which poindexter tore up on nov 21 
1986 the december 1985 finding retroactively legalized a november 
1985 shipment of hawk missiles to iran 
north testified at his trial that he watched poindexter tear up 
the finding which relates to four of the five criminal charges 
against the exnational security adviser but north testified last 
week that he was certain it was the finding that was destroyed only 
because poindexter admitted it in his immunized testimony on 
national tv 
i think that north has snaked his way around that and wont 
have to testify at the trial about poindexter tearing up the 
finding said john nields former chief counsel to the house 
majority staff in the congressional irancontra hearings 
nields said that since north did not tell the congressional 
committees that he saw poindexter destroy the finding he wont 
be able to testify to it at the trial and i dont think the 
government has any other proof of it 
the prosecution says the finding which poindexter destroyed is 
the most critical document in proving the falsity of another 
document a chronology which is an essential part of the 
governments case against poindexter 
poindexter is accused of telling congress the same day he 
destroyed the finding that no one in the us government knew until 
1986 that the november 1985 shipment to iran contained hawk 
missiles

the democratic party announced plans tuesday 
to target statehouse elections in 18 states next year in the hope 
of controlling state legislatures when congressional districts are 
redrawn for the 1990s 
the democrats hope to raise 3 million to help candidates for 
the legislatures in those states next year said tim dickson who 
heads the partys project 500 program 
the programs aim is to expand democratic control of state 
legislatures before they begin congressional and state legislative 
reapportionment in 1992 
democrats are particularly concerned with states likely to gain 
or lose congressional districts as a result of population shifts 
that will come to light in the 1990 census they are also focusing 
on states where the majoritys grip in the state legislature is 
tenuous 
we believe fair lines will be drawn but we prefer to be the 
ones drawing them dickson told a news conference since 1980 
individual elections have been battles but control of 
redistricting is the war 
the targeted states are arizona california colorado 
connecticut florida illinois indiana iowa michigan new 
jersey new york ohio oregon pennsylvania texas virginia 
washington and wisconsin 
democrats now control 36 state houses and 32 state senates 
while republicans control 12 houses and 17 senates they share 
power in indianas house nebraska has a nonpartisan bicameral 
legislature 
dickson said that the 3 million would be more than three times 
what the national party spent toward state legislative races in 
1988 and that his group has raised 650000 toward the goal 
the party will give money to democratic legislative campaign 
organizations in each of the states which will decide how to 
divide it among individual candidates some of the money may go to 
gubernatorial candidates although the party has another fund for 
those campaigns 
of the targeted states five are exected to gain congressional 
seats because of population shifts one or two seats in arizona 
five or six seats in california three or four seats in florida and 
texas and one seat in virginia 
six other states are expected to lose seats due to 
reapportionment with new york projected to lose three seats and 
ohio and pennsylvania each expected to lose two and possibly three 
illinois is projected to lose two seats according to the 
democrats iowa one seat and wisconsin perhaps one 
the republican national committee also has a program to target 
state legislative races and governors races leslie goodman a 
spokeswoman for the republicans said the party would not reveal 
its spending plans or list its targeted states 
it makes no sense to lay out a political game plan she said 
but goodman said the republicans will be focusing on states 
where redistricting will mean a gain or loss of congressional 
seats and what she said were 14 states where republicans are 
within striking distance of winning control of at least one 
legislative chamber now held by the democrats 
ultimately we have to do better in redistricting than we did 
in 81 she said we consistently get gerrymandered out of our 
fair share were never going to have a shot if we dont get 
the lines drawn fairly and properly

the state department said on tuesday that 
israel made a major oil deal with iran as part of a reported effort 
to win the release of three israeli soldiers being held in lebanon 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said israel informed 
the united states of the oil deal a month ago she declined to say 
whether the united states approved of the deal 
foreign countries do not seek us approval for oil purchases 
from a third country she added 
the united states has no diplomatic relations with iran and is 
worried about the possibility of iranianbacked terrorist incidents 
against american targets in europe or africa during the holiday 
season 
iran is one of six countries which according to the state 
department supports international terrorism 
nbc news disclosed the oil transaction monday night saying that 
israel paid iran 36 million and that one purpose was to encourage 
iran to use its influence to help free three israeli soldiers being 
held in lebanon 
the united states is backing the deal in hopes that it could 
lead to the release of american hostages held in lebanon nbc said 
ms tutwiler said the united states does not make deals for the 
release of us hostages but she refused to offer an opinion as to 
whether there is any objection to israel carrying out negotiations 
on behalf of the hostages 
in addition to winning the radical moslem countrys help in 
seeking the release of israelis the oil purchases and a potential 
spare parts deal are intended to bolster irans position against a 
common enemy iraq nbc said 
irans islamic fundamentalist leaders are generally hostile to 
israel but the countrys struggling economy is sorely in need of 
foreign currency 
spokesmen for israels energy foreign and defense ministries on 
tuesday refused to comment on the report the defense ministry also 
refused to allow reporters to talk to uri lubrani mentioned in the 
nbc report as the man who dealt with the iranians in switzerland 
lubrani is responsible for israels lebanon policy and served as 
ambassador to iran before the revolution that swept ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini to power 
joseph alpher of the tel aviv universitys jaffee center for 
strategic studies executive editor of the centers annual middle 
east military balance said israel had other considerations that 
could justify ties with iran apart from seeking the release of its 
prisoners 
iraq is getting stronger every day by acquiring chemical and 
nonconventional arms that threaten us alpher said on israel 
television there is a reason to see to it that iran can continue 
confronting and diversing the iraqi forces 
beyond that iran has oil iran has jews and all these are 
good reasons for renewal of connections with iran without any 
relation to the governing regime he said

nicolae ceausescu of romania visiting 
iran while his security forces suppress protesters at home laid a 
wreath tuesday at the tomb of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and spoke 
of peace in the persian gulf 
the romanian president said iraqis should withdraw from iranian 
territory so the rival neighbors can sign a peace treaty 
irans official islamic republic news agency quoted ceausescu as 
saying an iraqi withdrawal is the starting point for 
implementation of un security council resolution 598 and we are 
trying our best in the security council to enforce this 
resolution 
while ceausescu was in tehran reports from romania indicated 
security forces may have killed hundreds of people during weekend 
demonstrations against ceausescu who runs the last stalinist 
regime in the soviet bloc 
romania has virtually sealed its borders and official media have 
not reported the unrest 
a unmediated truce ended an 8yearold war between iran and 
iraq in august 1988 but peace talks have not resolved their 
differences 
iran insists the iraqis withdraw from territory occupied in the 
last weeks of the war iraq wants a border that gives it full 
control of the shattalarab waterway its sole outlet to the 
persian gulf 
tehran radio said ceausescu met separately with vice president 
roghani zanjani and foreign minister ali akbar velayati on tuesday 
the second day of a threeday official visit 
he and zanjani discussed an agreement under which iran will 
export about 1 billion cubic meters of natural gas and 1 million 
barrels of oil a year to romania 
romania is irans secondlargest trading partner in eastern 
europe the estimated volume this year is about 18 billion 
according to the radio ceausescu expressed readiness to 
cooperate with iran in numerous fields stressing cooperation 
in mining

the beheshte zahra cemetery outside tehran the revolutionary 
patriarch died june 3

people who track hate groups said tuesday that 
white supremacists are logical suspects in the mailbomb killings 
of a federal judge in alabama and a lawyer in georgia 
racist mentalities fit the bill in both motive and mode they 
are angry over recent defeats in court cases and they have a 
historical bent for bombings according to two hate group watchers 
theres no reason to disbelieve they would be connected to 
these incidents they have planned to kill federal judges before 
and there have been similar incidents with bombs said danny 
levitan executive director of the center for democratic renewal in 
atlanta 
on saturday a mail bomb killed 11th us circuit court of 
appeals judge robert s vance who wrested control of the alabama 
democratic party from white supremacists during the 1960s at his 
home in a birmingham ala suburb on monday another mail bomb 
killed savannah ga alderman robert robinson an attorney who was 
working on a longrunning school desegregation case 
a fourth bomb was found tuesday at the jacksonville fla 
office of the national association for the advancement of colored 
people the office was evacuated and the bomb which arrived in the 
mail monday but was left unopened was disarmed officials said 
fbi director william sessions told a washington news conference 
tuesday that the pattern didnt fit white supremacist groups but 
said they werent being ruled out the fbi has warned civil rights 
activists as well as lawyers and judges to beware of strange 
packages because of the possibility white supremacists mailed the 
savannah bomb 
the bombs that killed vance and robinson were pipe bombs 
containing nails authorities said 
racist groups typically use that sort of bomb said leonard 
zeskind research director for the center for democratic renewal 
the klan and nazi groups are more likely to use pipe or powder 
bombs he said plastic explosives is drug stuff 
recent court losses have hurt racist groups in the pocketbook 
and in efforts to recruit more members giving them a potential 
motive for retaliation said pat carter of klanwatch 
some of these groups are perturbed that they are losing their 
assets she said it has made their membership very bitter 
in 1987 a us district court jury awarded 7 million to the 
mother of a mobile ala teenager murdered in 1981 by two ku klux 
klansmen last year a us district court jury in atlanta awarded 
950400 in damages to two civil rights leaders because of violence 
surrounding the first of two civil rights marches in forsyth 
county ga in 1987 
white supremacist groups have enjoyed renewed popularity in the 
south over the past decade incidents of racial hatred surged from 
eight in 1978 to 276 in 1986 the last year for which figures were 
available according to statistics compiled by the us justice 
departments community relations service 
the center for democratic renewal formerly the antiklan 
network found 3000 racial incidents reported between 1980 and 
1986 including about 500 in 1986 alone levitan said 
we view the level of hate crimes as having reached epidemic 
proportions he said skinheads and youth are at the cutting 
edge 
skinheads favor extremely short haircuts many but not all 
also embrace white supremacist ideology 
klanwatch a unit of the southern poverty law center in 
montgomery ala has identified at least 11 active hate groups in 
georgia and alabama including two skinhead groups in alabama and 
one in georgia

shooting and fires were reported tuesday 
in western romania where witnesses say security forces may have 
killed hundreds of people who protested the harsh communist regime 
of president nicolae ceausescu 
greek students who crossed into yugoslavia from the romanian 
city of timisoara site of the greatest unrest over the weekend 
said shots were fired indiscriminately killing dozens 
they said many children were killed or wounded because people 
used them as shields assuming security forces would hold their 
fire 
a romanian doctor who arrived in austria spoke of protesters 
stoning armored vehicles he said one vehicle drove into the crowd 
crushing a woman and rows of people were mowed down by gunfire 
ceausescu was on the second day of a threeday official visit to 
iran he has run romania for 24 years and the tide of reform 
sweeping out the old guard elsewhere has made him the 
longestserving communist ruler 
late tuesday the yugoslav state news agency tanjug in what it 
called an eyewitness account said there were unconfirmed reports of 
up to 2000 dead most previous accounts from a variety of sources 
leaving romania estimated 300 to 400 dead 
some travelers say that in timisoara police are brutally 
fighting demonstrators mostly young people unconfirmed reports 
speak of large numbers of victims as many as 2000 people men 
women and children tanjug said without identifying its sources 
it added witnesses claim that police are taking the arrested 
demonstrators to the central timisoara square where they beat them 
and stab them with bayonets before shoving them into lorries 
trucks and driving them away no one knows where 
the news agency said the clashes in timisoara a translyvanian 
city were continuing and that late tuesday the government in 
belgrade called on romania to immediately put an end to violence 
and prevent further bloodshed 
the roman catholic news agency kathpress in vienna said a doctor 
told them by telephone from timisoara 30 miles from the yugoslav 
and hungarian borders that hundreds were wounded and deaths could 
surpass 400 
none of the accounts could be confirmed because journalists and 
nearly all other foreigners were barred in an effort to stop word 
of the unrest from spreading repeated attempts to telephone 
bucharest from vienna and budapest on tuesday were unsuccessful 
tanjug reported from bucharest capital of romania that 
students there had declared solidarity with the protesters in 
timisoara and in response police guards were posted in 
dormitories 
the soviet news agency tass said an unusual tension is 
noticeable in bucharest the guarding of government agencies 
plants and factories has been strengthened on the streets 
soldiers armed with automatic weapons and members of the patriotic 
peoples front militia are patrolling buses are parked with 
soliders and policemen 
in washington the bush administration condemned the brutal 
use of police force and said the united states was consulting 
with allies about the possibility of sending independent observers 
to romania 
accounts trickling out suggested ceausescu the last stalinist 
ruler in the soviet bloc sanctioned unprecedented force to crush 
the protest 
tass said soviet authorities had been told no soviet tourists 
could be accepted due to adverse weather conditions the absence 
of snow needed for winter tourism and a great demand for hotel 
space from students on holidays 
romanians have been comparatively quiet for years largely out 
of fear but have been made restive by austerity policies that 
subjected the nation of 23 million to widespread rationing and 
other hardships 
timisoara a city of 350000 people is a major point of contact 
with other countries foreign traders travel there regularly to 
sell goods that are scarce in romania 
official romanian media made no mention of disturbances but the 
communist party daily scinteia said in a commentary the spirit as 
well as the letter of the law must be applied in every field and 
every circumstance 
a western resident of timisoara traveled to yugoslavia on 
tuesday and said the violence was horrifying 
he reported seeing several corpses in the streets and said parts 
of the downtown area including local communist party headquarters 
were badly damaged 
hungarian radio quoted a hungarian who said several of his 
relatives were physicians working in timisoara hospitals he said 
he estimated from their telephone reports that 300 to 400 people 
were killed in the city and 250 bodies were taken to one hospital 
alone 
about 20 percent of the dead and wounded were ethnic hungarians 
he said 
that would substantiate other accounts that the protest began 
with a few hundred ethnic hungarians defending a local pastor 
friday and grew into a demonstration against ceausescu on sunday 
it was the largest antigovernment protest since a march by 10000 
workers in brasov in november 1987 
a romanian doctor arrived at graz from timisoara on monday 
evening told the austria press agency thousands of people chanting 
down with ceausescu we are hungry and we want 
freedom movedtoward the center of the city at about 2 pm 
sunday stoning armored vehicles 
he said one armored vehicle drove into the crowd like crazy 
i saw a woman of about 40 driven over and crushed but the 
protesters did not disperse 
security forces opened fire without warning about 7 pm and 
the first three rows just collapsed dead or wounded he was 
quoted as saying 
there was panic some people wanted to go back the crowd was 
pushing forward people were stopping private cars and loading dead 
or wounded into the trunks 
magyar hirlap a hungarian daily said violence had spread to 
arad and brasov two other cities in transylvania but gave no 
specifics 
it quoted col janos pal of the hungarian border police as 
saying crowds in curtici between arad and timisoara broke into 
the local communist party headquarters sunday and burned documents 
romania and hungary have a longstanding dispute about alleged 
harassment of the 17 million ethnic hungarians in romania most of 
whom live in transylvania that region along with moldavia in the 
north has been the center of what little protest has occurred 
frank zemberi a yugoslav trucker bound from cluj romania to 
london said he passed through timisoara early tuesday and saw two 
large fires raging in distant parts of town 
countless tanks were parked on the outskirts of timisoara 
he said but the city appeared calm he reported seeing five 
armored vehicles parked in the downtown area and police vans 
cruising the streets 
hungarian radio said a caller from timisoara reported gunfire in 
the streets tuesday then the telephone went dead 
radio kossuth which said it got a call through briefly to 
timisoara on tuesday morning quoted a resident it did not name as 
saying things were calm during the day but at night its like 
during the war 
all main intersections have roadblocks everybody is 
checked and people are not allowed to leave town except in extreme 
cases the radio quoted the resident as saying

jack scherbak said he always figured if you 
built a better roach killer the world would beat a path to your 
door 
he claims he has they havent 
a selfproclaimed jackofalltrades he admits to only a slight 
frustration in his latest attempt to crack the corporate 
marketplace with a new idea 
some people have money and no ideas other people have ideas 
and no money he said in an interview im in the latter 
category 
scherbak 49 who also works as a carpenter and plays classical 
guitar at nightclubs and restaurants majored in physics and math 
for one year at the university of nebraskalincoln but literature 
finally won out over math 
science has always been restricted he said last week in 
a sense its just like the guitar you have to practice to be able 
to express your emotion 
inspired by beat poet jack kerouac scherbak left college and 
hit the road he joined the army and was a medic in texas then 
took art and sculpture classes in new york city 
several years ago he submitted a plan to the nebraska energy 
office to fill discarded aluminum cans with popped pocorn and build 
insulating panels walls roofs even a whole house he said 
they said it was a novel idea but no loan company would give 
a person a loan to build with something so unconventional he 
said 
earlier this year scherbak confronted a real and present 
problem roaches under the kitchen sink 
commercial roach traps didnt work he said sprays were toxic 
and he didnt want to endanger his familys health 
so he began mixing common household ingredients until he found 
a nontoxic combination that worked he wont say whats in it 
because its not patented yet 
he put it in a spray can labeled zez the worlds first 
nontoxic roach spray 
he carries the can along with a plastic gallon jug full of live 
roaches and a large metal kettle for demonstrations 
after dumping four roaches into the kettle he sprayed them with 
zez as they died he sprayed the product into his eyes and mouth 
the roaches are dead but im ok he said 
hes not bashful in attempts to market the stuff 
last month he wrote to the entertainment director of the 
tonight show saying hed like to meet nebraska native johnny 
carson and demonstrate his product on the television show 
theres still no word from hollywood but at least we dont 
have roaches under our sink anymore he said

testimony ended tuesday in larry 
mahoneys trial on 27 murder charges and lawyers said the nations 
worst drunkendriving case might go to the jury wednesday 
still to come were closing arguments and the judges 
instructions to the carroll circuit court jury 
mahoney 36 allegedly was drunk and driving on the wrong side 
of interstate 71 when his pickup rammed the front of a church bus 
on may 14 1988 fire erupted from the bus ruptured fuel tank and 
24 children and three adults died one adult and 39 children 
escaped 
in addition to the murder charges mahoney also is charged with 
12 counts of firstdegree assault 42 of wanton endangerment and 
one of drunken driving 
the defense has claimed that mahoney did not intentionally get 
drunk and that the former school bus a 1977 model manufactured by 
ford motor co and shellerglobe corp was unsafe 
autopsies showed the fire not the crash killed the victims 
mahoneys lawyers pressed the bussafety issue tuesday 
rebutting a prosecution witness testimony that school buses are 
safer than other passenger vehicles 
the prosecution testimony from analyst william boehly of the 
national highway traffic safety administration was based on the 
accident rate per miles traveled by school buses 
but byron bloch an autosafety design consultant from potomac 
md testified for the defense that buses were safe only from 
boehlys narrow statistical perspective 
it would be erroneous to conclude that his data rubberstamp 
the accident bus as a safe bus bloch said 
the final witness was donald wright a local musician whose 
testimony was intended to discredit kelly osborne the man who 
defense lawyers say tricked mahoney into drinking vodka the night 
of the bus crash 
osborne testified monday that he mixed a vodka and sprite for 
mahoney but only at mahoneys request osborne denied he ever 
spiked anyones drink 
wright testified that jake lansdale a 79yearold fiddler with 
whom he plays was incapacitated for nearly three hours after 
drinking from a cup osborne handed him during a performance in 
august lansdale usually drank nothing when they played 
occasionally drank a beer but had never been seen drinking liquor 
wright said 
but wright could not swear that osborne put anything in 
lansdales cup and said he did not know what made lansdale 
collapse 
judge charles satterwhite said lansdale had been subpoenaed to 
testify but was excused because of illness 
special prosecutor paul richwalsky wrapped up his case monday 
with rebuttal witnesses and declined to call further witnesses 
tuesday 
attorneys said jurors would have two alternatives to the 27 
murder charges seconddegree manslaughter punishable by five to 
10 years in prison and reckless homicide punishable by one to 
five years in each case a fine of up to 10000 can be imposed

youve heard of the stealth bomber and the 
stealth fighter undetectable airplanes the pentagon has now 
created the stealth memo it cant be detected either 
pentagon spokesman pete williams queried tuesday about the 
results of his monthslong attempts to obtain more information 
about the stealth f117a fighter for reporters acknowledged that 
several memos on the subject have been lost 
even in the pentagon amazingly as it seems memos get lost 
and deep sixed and vanish into thin air stealth memos yes this 
is a stealth memo program that were testing williams quipped 
when asked about his efforts 
in fact a memorandum to the secretary of the air force was 
written on this issue sent to the air force and it vanished 
the air forces own radar couldnt detect it williams joked 
the f117a is the air forces most secret operational aircraft 
based at tonopah test range airfield in nevada the jets have been 
carefully screened from public view 
but in recent months more and more have been observed in flight 
and pictures of the black deltawinged craft have appeared in 
magazines and technical journals 
the jet which was first test flown in 1978 uses the socalled 
stealth technology to provide it with low radar reflectivity 
like its newer betterknown cousin the b2 bomber 
the spokesman said the memo first sent to air force secretary 
donald rice about providing the press with more information was 
subsequently found and revived and sent to another office and 
it vanished into thin air again 
williams stated that he was certain the air force had not deep 
sixed the memo or allowed it to be lost arguing that the 
service wanted to make more information about the socalled 
black program known 
black programs are the most secret in the pentagon with 
little information released about them 
one defense department source who spoke on condition he not be 
identified by name said air force officials would like to release 
some information about the f117a program to show that its was 
wellrun in contrast to difficulties that arose over the costly 
b2 bomber another classified plane that now is estimated to cost 
530 million apiece 
the spokesman said the lost memo was recreated in my office 
and sent to rice again and that he has approved it 
so there will be some effort to share more information about 
the program with you williams pledged 
the spokesman contended that the troubles arose because of the 
highly secret nature of the fighter program and officials wanted to 
be as forthcoming as we can without jeoapardizing the very 
classified nature of the program we dont do this a lot we 
dont embark very much on a public affairs campaign about black 
programs 
so were in kind of a new area here and we are trying to make 
an effort

soviet and japanese officials failed to reach an 
accord to formally settle world war ii in their latest round of 
talks with progress stymied by a territorial dispute dating back to 
1945 officials said tuesday 
soviet deputy foreign minister igor rogachev suggested that 
tokyo and moscow exchange drafts of a peace treaty to formally 
settle world war ii but japanese officials showed little 
enthusiasm insisting progress must first be made toward resolving 
the dispute over the kuril islands 
the dispute over the group of small islands north of hokkaido 
japans northernmost main island has been the most difficult 
obstacle to concluding the treaty 
japan has demanded that the islands held by the soviets since 
the closing days of the war in 1945 be returned it has said no 
peace treaty can be worked out until the issue is resolved 
the soviets have called on japan to renounce its claim and 
recognize postwar realities 
the time has come to exchange drafts of the treaty a treaty 
that will be the conclusive settlement to world war ii rogachev 
said at a news conference after meeting with japanese foreign 
minister taro nakayama 
their overall position hasnt changed foreign ministry 
spokesman taizo watanabe said he added that tokyo saw the offer as 
a soviet attempt to prompt procedures in their direction 
both sides agreed in december to form a workinglevel group to 
discuss the treaty and rogachev led the soviet delegation at the 
groups fourth round of talks monday 
rogachev acknowledged that the nearly seven hours of 
negotiations monday broke down because of the territorial issue 
the veteran soviet diplomat in tokyo on the final leg of a 
fivenation tour of asia said moscow is taking into consideration 
recent statements by japanese leaders indicating a desire for 
improved relations 
during a visit to tokyo last month alexander yakovlev a 
politburo member and close adviser to soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev hinted at a third route to a solution raising hopes 
here 
rogachev however offered no such route saying only that 
though the soviet claim to the islands hasnt changed relations 
continue to improve bit by bit and within a certain framework 
he said that along with defining japansoviet borders the 
treaty should reflect an agreement to cooperate in the economic 
development of the soviet far east and pacific coast areas 
rogachev said the next round of talks will be held early next 
year japanese officials hope to hold talks before soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze visits in march 
rogachev said he and nakayama also discussed gorbachevs 
scheduled visit to japan in 1991 a first for a soviet president

legislators on tuesday endorsed prime minister 
margaret thatchers controversial policy of forcibly repatriating 
vietnamese from hong kong and the government indicated it will 
resume the deportations which had been suspended 
the 309219 vote in the house of commons followed an acrimonious 
threehour debate 
paddy ashdown leader of the centrist social and liberal 
democratic party said repatriating the boat people against their 
will shames our government shames the prime minister and 
ultimately shames our nation 
the first deportations of 51 vietnamese on dec 12 provoked an 
international outcry the us administration called it 
unacceptable 
the conservative government suspended the repatriations to allow 
for the parliamentary debate 
it was a decision that gave pleasure to none and i 
acknowledge has caused anxiety to many foreign office minister 
francis maude told the commons tuesday night 
but he said the burden of 57000 boat people now lingering in 
hong kong detention camps and the prospect of thousands more 
arriving when the sailing season begins in the spring had become 
intolerable 
all but 13000 of the boat people have been classified as 
economic migrants not political refugees fleeing persecution 
for those of us who do have those responsibilities they 
cannot be dodged they cannot be shirked and we wont shirk them 
maude declared indicating the repatriations will resume he gave 
no date 
of course the united states has been critical there are 
historical reasons for this but they have had no realistic 
alternative to propound maude added 
the government meanwhile could face another storm of criticism 
after an announcement due wednesday on the number of hong kong 
chinese who will be given residence rights in britain after china 
takes over the colony in 1997 
leaks from government officials put the total at about 225000 
of the 325 million hong kong chinese who now hold british 
passports without residence rights 
the british move is intended to cover about 50000 key 
government employees entrepreneurs and their families needed to 
maintain the british administration and the territorys capitalist 
system 
dozens of british legislators have threatened to vote down new 
legislation to alter current hong kong passports 
the rebellion is led by rightwingers opposed to immigration 
from britains largely african asian and caribbean former colonies 
the government argues that with the insurance policy of british 
residence such people will stay for now and not join the estimated 
1000 skilled residents leaving hong kong each week for australia 
canada or the united states 
we most certainly have a duty to those crown servants in hong 
kong who have enabled us and will enable us to carry out british 
administration right up to 1997 mrs thatcher told a questioner 
in the commons 
china has pledged to allow capitalism and a great degree of 
autonomy in hong kong for 50 years

britain said tuesday it would deport two iranian 
students their lawyer said they said were suspected of plotting to 
kill salman rushdie author of the satanic verses 
two other iranians arrested the same day were freed one a 
40yearold man who has four children and suffers from multiple 
sclerosis said he was accused in hours of police questioning of 
being a terrorist 
the four were arrested friday at their homes in manchester under 
the prevention of terrorism act which gives police the right to 
hold them for seven days without charges 
the home office said in a statement tuesday night that 
engineering students karen abrinia 32 and mehrdad kokabi 33 
would be sent to iran as soon as possible it said they were 
being deported for reasons of national security but did not 
elaborate 
another student hussein gharibi and javad mousavi 40 the 
disabled father of four were freed gharibis age was not 
available 
attorney zahir aziz who represents the four iranians said 
monday the police have told me very little but the men are 
under the impression they have been arrested because they are 
suspected of being a hit squad to kill salman rushdie 
the indianborn british novelist was condemned to death feb 14 
by the late iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini who accused 
him of blaspheming islam in his novel he has been in hiding since 
under police protection 
britain and iran have taken tentative steps toward renewing 
diplomatic relations severed over the rushdie affair but the 
latest arrests jeopardize that process 
mousavi said after his release tuesday night that accused him of 
masterminding a plot to kill rushdie 
i dont know how to make bombs he said in the living room 
of his manchester home his wheelchair nearby they accused me of 
plotting to kill salman rushdie but i told them i was innocent 
i am against terrorism mousavi said i am in favor of 
salman rushdie being punished but not by me he should be punished 
by islamic law and islamic courts 
he said police questioned him three hours a day for five days 
a police lady was very nice he sad but then a 
superintendent was very bad he told me you are a terrorist i 
said how could i be a terrorist i am a disabled man they said i 
could be a mastermind telling the others how to make bombs 
irans official islamic republic news agency on monday quoted 
the newspaper kayhan on monday as saying the arrests followed 
antirushdie demonstrations by moslems at more than 1000 mosques 
in britain 
tehran radio said parliament speaker mahdi karrubi read a letter 
tuesday from several members urging the foreign ministry to take 
appropriate steps to protect the four iranians 
it quoted the letter as saying the iranians were arrested 
because the glory and size of the demonstrations had angered 
british authorities 
if england does not change its hostile stance against islam 
and does not apologize to moslems the wave of these demonstrations 
in england will surely increase the radio quoted karrubi as 
saying 
patrick stephenson registrar at the university of manchester 
institute of science and technology said kokabi and abrinia were 
engineering students who had completed their course work for 
doctorates and were writing dissertations it was not known where 
gharibi studies

soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze on tuesday symbolically ended 40 years of eastwest 
hostility and suspicion by paying a visit to nato headquarters 
he said the north atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw 
pact should stay in place to help ensure stability at a time of 
tumultuous change on the european continent 
shevardnadze later went before the european parliament the 
legislative arm of the european community and strongly cautioned 
against quick efforts to unite the two germanys leaders of the 
12nation trading bloc recently gave their strong backing to 
eventual reunification 
the soviet official noted east germany was an ally in the warsaw 
pact and said 
it is necessary to proceed on the basis of the postwar 
realities namely the existence of two sovereign german states 
a retreat from that is fraught with destabilization in europe 
later shevardnadze flew to london where he got a strong 
endorsement from prime minister margaret thatcher for keeping nato 
and the warsaw pact in place 
neither mrs thatcher and shevardnadze would give details of 
their 2hour discussion but shevardnadze said that on a number 
of very important world issues both global issues and regional 
issues we have a very good measure of agreement 
shevardnadzes unprecedented visit to nato headquarters on the 
outskirts of brussels was a dramatic sign of the reduced military 
tensions between western nations and their potential adversaries in 
the east bloc nato was formed in 1949 to guard against the 
security threat posed by the soviet union 
after meeting with nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner 
shevardnadze joked that his visit had been likened to traveling to 
a volcanos crater but he said he found a very friendly 
atmosphere so this was not a terrible thing 
shevardnadze who also met the ambassadors of the 16 nato 
nations stressed the need for continuing the two alliances 
we do believe the warsaw treaty and nato at this crucial stage 
in european development are able to play a very important 
stabilizing role he told reporters 
woerner a former german defense minister said shevardnadze 
mentioned in their private talks the very essential role of the 
americans here in europe 
the officials said they agreed an eastwest accord on slashing 
conventional or nonnuclear weapons in europe could be wrapped up 
next year they said the united states and the soviet union also 
should reach agreement in 1990 on a new treaty cutting longrange 
nuclear weapons 
woerner said shevardnadze suggested formal contacts be set up 
between the two military alliances but the nato chief said he 
reminded shevardnadze that nato unlike the warsaw pact was a 
voluntary association of democratically elected governments 
william h taft iv the american ambassador to nato said the 
warsaw pact needs to do some more changing before its a proper 
partner in dialogue with nato 
no surprises were reported 
it was an important event but the importance was really a 
symbolic one rather than substantive said gordon smith canadas 
envoy to nato 
added taft it was more of a getacquainted session 
in his speech to the european parliament shevardnadze welcomed 
us secretary of state james a baker iiis recent call for nato 
to adopt a more political role in an era of reduced tensions he 
said the warsaw pact also must change with political aspects 
prevailing over its military substance 
but the focus of his remarks was on the subject of german unity 
which has gained increasing attention with the opening of borders 
between the two countries 
shevardnadze the question of borders in europe was settled 
permanently but the germanys retained the right to 
selfdetermination 
he said there should be due regard for the special position of 
the two german states and their responsibility to assure all 
nations of europe and the world that a threat of war will never 
again come from the german soil 
he said a number of questions remained unanswered 
where are the guarantees that german unity would not 
eventually create a threat to the national security of other states 
and to peace in europe he asked 
he wondered where a united germany would fit into 
militarypolitical structures one cannot seriously expect the 
status of east germany to change radically while the status of 
west germany would remain the same he said 
surely the peoples of the soviet union are entitled to know 
what any changes in central europe would mean for their future and 
their security he said we paid the price of 20 million lives 
for the existing european stability 
furthermore can the german people themselves forget the 
national tragedy brought onto them by hitlerism he said

president bush told mikhail s gorbachev at 
the malta summit that using force to block nonviolent independence 
movements in the three baltic republics would damage ussoviet 
relations a senior administration source said tuesday 
i think the soviet leadership understands our position on this 
very clearly said the us official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
meanwhile an emigre baltic diplomat who was briefed by us 
officials on the discussion said he was told that gorbachev 
responded that violence would not be used under his reform 
however gorbachev made no specific promises on the baltics whose 
independence he has opposed the diplomat said 
secretary of state james a baker iii received similar 
assurances from his soviet counterpart in september the 
conversation at malta was significant because the independence 
movements are gaining strength 
the united states never recognized the soviet annexation of 
lithuania latvia and estonia after world war ii 
under gorbachevs reforms those three republics with a 
combined population of 7 million have been striving for 
independence gorbachev has said that postwar soviet borders 
cannot be changed 
bushs conversation with gorbachev was not disclosed in the days 
immediately after the dec 23 summit but representatives of the 
three emigre baltic governments were briefed monday by assistant 
secretary of state raymond seitz 
by warning gorbachev against the use of force bush assisted the 
baltic independence movements said stasys lozoraitis charge 
daffaires at the washington legation of the lithuania the exile 
governments of the three republics have maintained legations in 
washington since they lost their independence 
if they do not use violence we can slowly and carefully do 
what we need to do lozoraitis said 
leaders of the lithuanian popular front sajudis are predicting a 
victory in february elections to the republican parliament and plan 
to use their majority to secede from the soviet union a step that 
is legal under the soviet constitution 
the administration source said that bush and the secretary of 
state have made clear our legal position that we do not recognize 
the incorporation and that their status ought to be a matter of 
selfdetermination we have no particular view as to the outcome 
a key point of the us position said the source was that the 
process should be peaceful the exchange on the issue at malta 
the source said wasnt really a dialogue it was a presenting of 
views

kgb chief vladimir a kryuchkov said tuesday it 
was an injustice to exile andrei d sakharov to gorky for 
nearly seven years a period of physical hardship and kgb 
harassment for the late human rights activist 
in a wideranging news conference with a group of female 
journalists the kgb head also predicted soviets will be less 
fearful of his agency after new laws are passed defining its 
actions in investigations including the use of informers and 
wiretaps 
i think criminals should be scared of the kgb but innocent 
people shouldnt he said but he acknowledged there is 
reason for ordinary citizens to be scared after years of 
repression of supposed internal enemies 
i think that when we pass a law on the kgb it will do a lot 
to calm the situation kryuchkov said 
sakharov winner of the 1975 nobel peace prize for his protests 
of human rights violations in the soviet union was buried monday 
with the pomp and respect due a national hero three years after he 
was released from his exile of january 1980december 1986 
president mikhail s gorbachev and half the politburo attended a 
memorial service kruchkov was not among them 
many mourners blamed the kgb for sakharovs poor health 
sakharov 68 had been drugged and forcefed during a hunger strike 
while in gorky and a doctor warned him we wont let you die 
but we will make you an invalid 
kryuchkov on tuesday said our activities should be aimed at 
defending human rights of the treatment given sakharov he said 
it was an injustice 
still the amiable kgb chiefs line was not quite consistent in 
written answers to questions he said we have tightened 
requirements for observation of laws and alternative 
applications of laws have been eliminated 
yet in verbal responses he exonerated previous kgb 
administrations and much of his current staff the law was 
imperfect but people were abiding by it he said 
security forces he said in another statement fought not 
against differentmindedness but against specific illegal acts 
thousands of soviets were imprisoned for their political beliefs 
under a law banning illdefined antisoviet activities the law 
was rescinded last spring 
the threehour meeting with kryuchkov was the latest sign of the 
kgbs greater attention to its image both at home and aboard he 
met the journalists at kgb headquarters in downtown moscow a site 
that still strikes fear into many soviets kgb stands for 
committee for state security 
kryuchkov a member of the communist partys ruling politburo 
also gave a clear indication that the leadership is leaning toward 
acceptance of sakharovs last call a demand for removal from the 
constitution of article 6 which guarantees the partys monopoly on 
power 
there is nothing eternal under the sun he said im 
talking about politics the leadership is not going to hold onto 
article 6 
if our congress decides to abolish or leave out this article 
there will be no tragedy he said 
the congress of peoples deputies heeded arguments from 
gorbachev and voted 1139 to 839 last week against placing the 
issue on the agenda of its current session only months ago 
sakharov was one of the few soviets who dared mention the question 
publicly but as one country after another in eastern europe 
abolished similar provisions under pressure of massive 
demonstrations and strikes gorbachevs position has softened 
the lithuanian parliament voted two weeks ago to eliminate a 
similar article from its constitution and substitute a multiparty 
system 
the kgb chief noted the constitution now treats the communist 
party as the leading organization though it may not be true 
he predicted the party would have to fight for its position in the 
future 
later he added we are analyzing what is going on in eastern 
europe we are trying to learn from these mistakes and from these 
events

prime minister herbert blaize who 
hailed the 1983 usled invasion of grenada as a rescue 
mission that restored democracy and who won the election that 
followed died tuesday after a long illness he was 71 
sir paul scoon the british governorgeneral named deputy prime 
minister ben jones to succeed blaize until general elections are 
held 
scoon appealed for calm and asked the nation to lend the new 
prime minister their support he noted that elections for a new 
government will be held shortly but set no date 
grenada the most southerly of the windward islands in the 
caribbean was due to hold general elections by march 1990 but the 
vote could be advanced 
blaize suffered for years from prostate cancer and crippling 
arthritis he died at his official mount royal residence scoon 
announced no cause of death was stated 
blaize walked with the aid of a cane and received regular cancer 
treatment at walter reed hospital in washington he had become 
increasingly frail and was unable to raise his voice above a 
whisper at a political luncheon this month 
he was elected prime minister on dec 3 1984 in the first 
election after us troops supported by a small caribbean force 
invaded grenada on oct 2428 1983 and ousted a marxist military 
junta that had seized power and assassinated prime minister maurice 
bishop 
the invasion was widely criticized abroad as a breach of 
grenadas sovereignty but blaize said it saved grenada from a 
brutal clique that placed the 100000 residents under a 24hour 
curfew 
it was god who sent the americans and caribbean forces to 
deliver them grenadians he said in an interview with the 
associated press in october 1988 
scoon queen elizabeth iis representative in the former british 
colony called the main opposition members of parliament in for 
talks tuesday on forming a successor government 
blaize had clung to power despite failing health political 
bickering that cost him the party leadership and a growing public 
clamor over what many called his authoritarian style of leadership 
herbert augustus blaize born on feb 26 1918 the son of a 
laborer on the grenadian offshore island of carriacou became 
leader of the grenada national party in 1959 and headed the 
government from 1962 to 1967 
grenada became independent from britain in 1974 
after the 1983 invasion a coalition of centrist parties was 
cobbled together under the banner of the new national party to 
prevent a possible election victory by sir eric gairy a populist 
who was ousted as prime minister in a 1979 leftist coup 
gairys former administration had been riven by charges of 
corruption and repression 
blaize a reagan administration favorite was chosen to head the 
coalition because of his previous government experience 
his popularity declined with the governments inability to 
improve the economy and put a dent in grenadas 20percent 
unemployment rate 
since the invasion the united states has pumped more than 100 
million into grenada but a widely expected foreign investment boom 
never materialized and us aid dropped off 
blaize is survived by his wife venetia and their three sons 
and three daughters 
a memorial service will be held friday at st georges anglican 
church with funeral and burial sunday in carriacou

an amtrak train smashed into a 
tractortrailer in dense fog and derailed tuesday killing three 
people and injuring 54 others authorities reported 
the engineer and fireman of the locomotive were killed when the 
engine careened off the tracks overturned and exploded the 
california highway patrol said the patrol said the driver of the 
truck which was loaded with chocolate syrup also was killed 
i was collecting tickets and then all hell broke loose said 
conductor gary burke i wound up flying into the next car 
it was like a nightmare said passenger phyllis ferguson of 
stockton i was sitting there reading the paper and then crash 
fire i was thrown to the floor seats crumpled ahead and behind 
me everybody was screaming and yelling 
several passengers said the train and ground were so covered 
with chocolate from the truck that they slipped when they tried to 
leave the train 
the train traveling southbound from oakland to bakersfield on 
amtraks san joaquin route was carrying at least 141 passengers 
patrol spokesman bob whitmire said 54 passengers were injured 
he said 23 seriously injured people were taken by ambulances to 
area hospitals and 31 with less serious injuries were taken by bus 
he said 87 uninjured passengers were taken to the riverbank 
amtrak station about 20 miles south of the crash site 
amtrak spokesman arthur lloyd said the train was going about 70 
mph when it hit the truck evidently the vehicle ignored lights 
and went right in front of the train lloyd said 
the patrol however said the cause of the crash was not 
immediately known whitmire said a motorist behind the truck 
reported not seeing warning lights 
the patrol said the locomotive pulling five passenger cars 
derailed after striking the truck about five miles southeast of 
stockton the train left stockton at 929 am 
the amtrak locomotive overturned and burst into flames which 
took crews 90 minutes to extinguish the truck was demolished 
broken into hundreds of pieces while its load of chocolate syrup 
coated two of the five passengers cars of the train 
the first passenger car came to rest crosswise across the tracks 
with one side torn open and the second car overturned the final 
three also derailed but remained upright 
claire austin a spokeswoman for the federal railroad 
administration in washington dc said the train was traveling 
within the speed limit 
on that stretch of track the speed limit is 79 mph she 
said when asked whether the train should have slowed because of 
the thick fog she said that there were no clamps on speed on 
that track because of weather conditions 
it was uncertain whether dense fog that has made san joaquin 
valley roads dangerous in recent days played a factor in the 
accident 
the national weather service reported there had been zero 
visibility almost constantly since monday night in the northern san 
joaquin valley dense fog caused a 69vehicle pileup near tracy 
west of stockton monday morning and a series of accidents 
involved 55 vehicles farther south in merced county

scientists have gotten their first good 
look at redoubt volcano and say most of its steam and volcanic ash 
seems to be erupting from a single small vent about twothirds of 
the way up the mountain 
the abrasive airborne ash which could clog aircraft engines 
delayed or detoured air traffic in and out of anchorage stacking 
up thousands of travelers and tons of mail among the stranded 
travelers were 70 korean air lines passengers who have refused 
since saturday to get on a plane 
anchorage international airport was open tuesday but service 
was irregular with some airlines grounding aircraft and others 
offering limited service some domestic airlines canceled flights 
and international carriers routed their aircraft around anchorage 
hunreds of stranded passengers were camping out in airports in 
anchorage and seattle and the backlog began to affect airports as 
far away as salt lake city 
the sky cleared enough monday to allow airborne scientists to 
get close to the 10197foot mountain for the first time since it 
began erupting thursday 
the alaska volcano observatory a joint center for state and 
federal scientists reported that the hot gritty material was 
coming from a vent less than 600 feet in diameter between the 
8000 and 8500foot level of the mountain 
no lava was observed in the vent or elsewhere in the volcanos 
crater scientists reported 
while the mountain continued to blow spectacular plumes up to 
30000 feet scientists said most of the material was steam they 
said volcanic ash blanketed the volcanos southeast flank 
they also observed a curtain of steam rising from a glacier on 
the north side of the volcano they said the steam appeared to be 
the result of water flowing from the vent down the glacier and into 
the drift river 
water from melting snow and ice is contained in the normal 
channel of the river which flooded extensively when the volcano 
last erupted more than two decades ago 
while emissions from the mountain appeared to contain less ash 
than before the federal aviation administration continued to warn 
pilots of the hazards of additional volcanic activity because of 
the abrasive ash a notice advised that suitable alternative 
airports may not be available should aircraft be forced to divert 
from anchorage 
about 70 korean air lines passengers remained in anchorage on 
tuesday because of flight safety said lee steiner kals customer 
relations manager in los angeles 
flight 25 with 240 passengers was en route from new york to 
seoul on saturday when it landed in anchorage the flight was 
delayed and passengers were taken to hotels 
then rumors started about the danger of flying near the ash 
clouds and about half the passengers refused to reboard their plane 
all but the 70 staybehinds got on a kal flight early tuesday 
steiner said he said the airline was paying their bills 
steiner said those staying in anchorage would be put aboard the 
next available flight to korea but we dont know when that will 
be at this point he said it depends on the climatic 
conditions 
last friday volcanic ash from redoubt shut down all four 
engines of a klm royal dutch airlines 747 causing the plane to 
glide from 25000 feet to 12000 feet in 12 minutes before the crew 
could restart the clogged engines 
anchorage with almost half the states population has escaped 
most of the ash settling to the ground in a fine gray layer the 
heaviest ash concentrations were reported over the kenai peninsula 
and prince william sound 
redoubt is located in a sparsely populated area 115 miles 
southwest of anchorage in the lake clark national park and preserve 
no injuries have been reported in the eruptions but one family 
was removed sunday from a lodge in the shadow of the volcano they 
were in no immediate danger another couple remains at a lodge 
north of the peak

mostly jews during world war ii 
the ontario supreme court ordered michael pawlowski who has 
lived in canada for 38 years to put up his modest brick bungalow

1942 in the byelorussian republic of the soviet union 400 jews in 
the small village of snov 10 more who escaped the first killings 
and 80 poles in the same region 
no mention was made in the charges as to whether pawlowski was

us ambassador thomas pickering hailed 
the 44th general assembly tuesday as one of the most 
constructive realistic sessions in recent memory for its 
approach to human rights disarmament and other issues 
pickering in a reception for reporters praised the 159member 
assembly for stepping away from governments which have come to 
power without the support of the people respect for human rights 
and a willingness to come to grips with such worldwide concerns as 
drugs human rights terrorism and the environment 
he noted the assembly which opened in september had embraced a 
consensus position on many issues echoing the cooperative approach 
to the west initiated by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
those who defended authoritarian regimes or clung to failed 
political and economic ways were clearly out of step at this 
session he said referring to cuba panama and nicaragua 
the 44th general assembly set the scene for a concrete 
chemical arms control initiative by president bush and a positive 
response from soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
pickering said 
during his speech to the assembly in september bush proposed 
deep cuts in the us and soviet poison gas stockpiles 
shevardnadze endorsed that idea but counterproposed ending 
production of chemical weapons as well us and soviet negotiators 
are now reconciling the two approaches 
the general debate set the tone with speeches which stressed 
optimism and pragmatism downplayed confrontation and welcomed 
improved eastwest relations and the uns renewed activism in 
helping to resolve regional conflicts pickering said 
this session had its down sides as well he noted 
unbalanced resolutions on the middle east central america and 
southern africa continue to be pursued here he said 
last week vice president dan quayle visited the united nations 
and said the assembly should repeal its 1975 zionism is racism 
resolution 
soviet deputy foreign minister vladimir petrovsky said later in 
the week that his country did not favor a repeal saying it would 
provoke a confrontation 
pickering said the united states would push for repeal only when 
sensed it would win on the issue saying a defeat would have the 
effect of giving renewed emphasis to the original resolution 
among the areas of agreement cited by pickering were consensus 
resolutions to ban driftnet fishing on the high seas calling for a 
free and sovereign afghanistan opposing terrorism denouncing 
apartheid and calling for a nonracial democratic society in south 
africa 
pickering praised the record number of votes in favor of a 
comprehensive political settlement to the cambodian conflict and 
record number of votes against the annual arab attempt to eject 
israel from the assembly 
namibias free and fair elections were a highlight of the year 
he said as were resolutions criticizing human rights violations in 
iran afghanistan el salvador and chile 
pickering criticized the palestine liberation organizations 
attempt to upgrade its status from an organization to a nonvoting 
member nation saying america preferred that this issue had never 
been raised 
action on that move was deferred until at least next year after 
the united states threatened to cut off its 216 million annual 
dues payment 
on friday the assembly concludes its annual fall session

president bush met with defense secretary 
richard cheney and attorney general dick thornburgh on tuesday to 
weigh a wider role for the military in the war on drugs 
administration officials said 
the subject of the oval office session was a recent justice 
department legal opinion suggesting the us military could legally 
arrest drug offenders overseas 
bush advocated use of the military for raids on strongholds of 
drug kingpins during last years presidential campaign he hinted 
at a military role in his sept 6 antidrug speech to the nation 
but at the times aides said he did not envision an overseas mission 
however presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said tuesdays 
session was to sort all this out including possible use of the 
military to interdict drug traffickers in the source countries 
bush has expressed recent frustration with the increase of 
drugrelated violence in colombia and with his inability to 
influence events in panama panamanian strongman manuel antonio 
noriega is under indictment in florida on drug trafficking charges 
at tuesdays white house session cheney presented a preliminary 
report on the role of the military in the antidrug effort to bush 
said white house spokeswoman alixe glen a final strategy will be 
forthcoming she said 
white house officials over the weekend acknowledged receiving 
the justice department opinion and said it was being studied 
the legal opinion said that the 1878 law which prohibits the 
military from funtioning as a police agency on us soil has no 
bearing overseas 
the report was written by assistant attorney general william p 
barr head of the justice departments office of legal counsel in 
november at the behest of the white house its existence was 
disclosed last week 
at the pentagon tuesday spokesman pete williams said the legal

a man accused of killing a police 
officer surrendered tuesday after holding a family hostage and 
telling a television station he shot the officer in the head 
because he was calling me a worm 
police arrested phillip cole 29 after cole tossed out his gun 
raised his hands and walked out of a rural lester prairie farmhouse 
around 515 am said hutchinson police sgt scott schwartz 
during the standoff cole spoke on the telephone with wccotv in 
minneapolis telling the station that he shot police officer 
michael hogan 
he was calling me a worm he was calling me a punk he said he 
was going to take me in i shot him in the head cole told the 
station 
it was the stupidest thing i did in my life because its 
costing me my life cole said 
cole who is charged with seconddegree murder in the death last 
friday was taken under heavy security to mcleod county jail in 
glencoe schwartz said 
seconddegree murder and theft charges also were filed tuesday 
against two women and a man arrested friday in hutchinson a town 
of about 10000 people 60 miles west of minneapolis in connection 
with hogans death 
the three others whom authorities allege were part of a 
shoplifting ring with cole were each held in lieu of 125000 
bail mcleod county attorney michael junge said 
junge said murder charges were filed because they should have 
and could have foreseen that based on mr coles violent nature 
and the fact that he carried a weapon their shoplifting could 
easily escalate to a shooting 
he said more than 1000 in merchandise was recovered from the 
van the three were in when they were arrested 
police would not say what charges were being considered 
hogan a 16year police veteran was shot to death in a private 
room at the jc penney store in hutchinson while he was 
interviewing cole as part of a shoplifting investigation 
the funeral for the 43yearold officer was held in hutchinson 
on tuesday about 600 people attended at least half of them law 
enforcement officials from around minnesota 
after hogan was shot cole allegedly escaped by commandeering a 
car to the twin cities authorities said on sunday and monday 
police surrounded three different minneapolis homes believing cole 
was hiding in each but they failed to find him 
as police surrounded the third home late monday night cole was 
able to get away and take a car driven by a woman who also became a 
hostage authorities said 
officers began chasing cole after an officer tried to pull his 
car over for a minor traffic violation in minnetonka said mcleod 
county sheriff duane kopesky 
coles car rolled over and cole who has a long record of 
violence and imprisonment ran from the accident to a farmhouse 
forcing a woman to go with him authorities said 
he then took alan and sandy otto and their 2yearold daughter 
hostage in their home kopesky said 
during the fivehour standoff kopesky said coles mother 
grace and one of his sisters were brought to the scene to talk to 
him by telephone the strategy helped convince cole to give up 
kopesky said 
steve geiger a police psychologist who assisted in the 
negotiations said there were extreme threats to the hostages in 
the house and it was very clear that cole wavered between homicidal 
and suicidal moments 
wccotv reported that during the standoff cole said he wanted to 
say goodbye to his mother and sister and commit suicide 
all i wanted was to talk to my family you know my family 
members and say goodbye to my friends and i was gonna let these 
people walk out the door and i was gonna take my own life cole 
told the station 
i just want to tell them that hey i love ya ya know and 
im sorry that this had to happen im sorry it came down to 
this he said 
the ottos did not immediately return a telephone call tuesday 
cole also told wccotv that a police officer helped him avoid 
capture by warning him of searches but police sgt phil vantassel 
said coles claim was ludicrous 
i believe its a little outlandish said minneapolis police 
chief john laux but on the other hand i am having my internal 
affairs commander review the tape and well look into it i 
havent drawn any conclusions so early

communist premier marian calfa 
endorsed opposition leader vaclav havel for president tuesday 
signaling a major victory for the peaceful prodemocracy revolution 
led by the playwrightactivist 
parliamentary leaders met after a session of the 
communistdominated federal assembly and agreed to reconvene it on 
dec 29 to elect a new president the meeting will be held at 
hradcany castle the presidential residence 
parliament late tuesday also unanimously approved a new 
government program outlining broad political and economic reforms 
including proposals to guarantee freedom of assembly and 
association and freedom of religion 
the program also calls for movement from a staterun economy 
toward a free market system but no further details were immediately 
available 
josef bartoncik head of the lower house and leader of the 
peoples party said his party would support havel and that the 
election would be in the interest of all citizens of our country 
the socialists like the peoples party one of four small 
parties in parliament also announced tuesday it would support 
havel 
in a speech to the communistdominated parliament calfa urged 
the deputies to elect a new president by the end of the year 
it is the governments opinion that there is no alternative 
than to elect vaclav havel as president calfa said 
he said the presidency should be filled at once in the 
interest of stability 
the presidency in czechoslovakia is a largely ceremonial post 
but it has great symbolic importance because of the respect the 
countrys first president tomas masaryk enjoyed in the 
independent czechoslovakia he founded in 1918 
calfa said the new president should serve only until june or 
july when czechoslovakia is to hold its first free elections in 43 
years 
havel whose works were banned when the uprising against rigid 
communist rule began a month ago has said he would serve as 
president only on an interim basis until a replacement was chosen 
by a democratically elected parliament 
havel was in prison as recently as may when he completed a 
fourmonth sentence on protestrelated charges 
jockeying over the presidency has dominated politics for nearly 
two weeks after a series of stunning opposition triumphs forced 
the communists to relinquish their monopoly on power and name the 
first government since 1948 not dominated by the party 
calfas endorsement of havel was an unprecedented show of 
support his government has been reported trying to overcome 
resistance among communist deputies to havels candidacy 
czechoslovakia has not had a president since dec 10 when 
gustav husak a member of the old guard resigned after swearing in 
the new government 
husaks resignation followed a series of leadership changes that 
removed hardline leaders associated with the crackdown after the 
warsaw pact invasion that ended the prague spring reforms of 
1968 led by alexander dubcek 
dubcek later dismissed as party chief and assigned to an 
obscure forestry job in bratislava also has been mentioned as a 
potential presidential candidate 
the communist party has been in disarray since a brutal police 
crackdown on student protesters nov 17 started the anticommunist 
revolution 
a twoday special party congress opens wednesday in prague and 
is expected to recommend more personnel and policy changes

the brandenburg gate a towering 
monument to unity that became a symbol of discord will reopen by 
christmas after being closed by the berlin wall for a generation 
the government said tuesday 
state television reported the date after premier hans modrow and 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany held a summit and said the 
gate would be opened on christmas eve but its editors late tuesday 
said the announcer had misread his text and that the date for 
reopening was by christmas day 
modrow kohl and the mayors of east and west berlin will preside 
sunday the television report said 
on tuesday west berlin police began setting up crowdcontrol 
barriers in front of the wall at the gate which is in east berlin 
at their summit modrow and kohl agreed to negotiate closer ties 
between the two germanys created at the end of world war ii the 
berlin wall was built in 1961 
modrow said that visafree travel between east and west germany 
will begin christmas eve and his government will free all political 
prisoners 
in a joint statement the german leaders said a 
goodneighborly relationship between the two states is of great 
importance for stability in europe and represents a contribution to 
the new european architecture 
at a news conference after their meeting modrow would not be 
specific about the brandenburg gate pedestrian crossing but kohl 
said we will all be able to take a walk across to the 
brandenburg gate before christmas 
the brandenburg gate was built 200 years ago and opened the road 
to the region of brandenburg in prussia but its six battlescarred 
sandstone columns became a symbol of division after the wall was 
built in 1961 the gate the size of a fivestory building 
remained on the eastern side 
in 1963 communist soldiers dropped huge red drapes over the 
gate to prevent president john f kennedy from looking into east 
berlin when he visited west berlin 
with the political upheaval that has ended communist domination 
in east germany and opened the countrys oncelocked borders the 
gate is viewed by millions as the symbol of german unity 
the issue of how to bring the nations closer dominated the first 
meeting of kohl and modrow and the public reaction highlighted the 
debate raging over possible reunification after more than four 
decades 
workers in hard hats left their jobs and joined thousands of 
others to catch a glimpse of kohl as he rode to the meeting in his 
motorcade of black mercedes limousines 
helmut helmut and germany united fatherland they 
shouted 
but posters in the city center read kohl go home 
a fourth reich is that why you stayed behind said one 
referring to east germans who have declined to emigrate to wealthy 
west germany choosing instead to stay behind and help rebuild 
their troubled socialist state 
east german tv reported 5000 people demonstrated against 
reunification in east berlin shouting nazis out 
modrow opposes reunification and soviet foreign minister eduard 
a shevadrdnadze reiterated the kremlins opposition to 
reunification during a speech tuesday to the european parliament 
it is necessary to proceed on the basis of the postwar 
realities namely the existence of two sovereign german states 
a retreat from that is fraught with destabilization in 
europe he said 
elsewhere in eastern europe 
shooting and fires were reported in western romania where 
there were reports that security forces have killed hundreds of 
people who protested the harsh communist regime of president 
nicolae ceausescu 
former czechoslovak dissident vaclav havel received an 
endorsement for the presidency from the communist premier marian 
calfa who urged that he be elected before the end of the year 
the soviet parliament pushed through an economic reform plan 
that retains heavy central planning in a noconfidence vote that 
premier nikolai i ryzhkov and his ministers easily survived 
lithuanias communist party leader urged a united political 
front with other parties to press for sovereignty and protect the 
baltic republic from kremlin pressure algirdis brazauskas avoided 
calling for an immediate direct break with the soviet communist 
party or for lithuanian indepenence but he left open both 
possibilities 
the german summit began with the signing of an economic 
cooperation agreement and pacts to boost cultural and travel ties 
a significant development is the planned treaty to improve 
cooperation and relations negotiations will start immediately 
modrow said with kohl saying he hoped the treaty could be signed 
by spring 
the leaders planned a second summit in late january or early 
february 
perhaps the most striking aspect of the summit was the welcome 
kohl received 
later at an evening rally a crowd of 20000 burst into rounds 
of wild cheers and applause as the west german leader addressed 
them as his countrymen and promised not to abandon them 
god bless our german fatherland he said 
some however carried signs supporting east german sovereignty 
kohl spoke near the ruins of the frauenkirche church of our 
lady destroyed during world war ii there kohl laid a bouquet in 
memory of war victims before addressing the flagwaving crowd 
unity unity unity they shouted as he began to speak 
kohl promised west german aid for the economic recovery 
assuring the crowd we will not desert our countrymen 
but mindful of warnings from east german leaders the 
superpowers and european neighbors that a reunited germany could 
threaten peace kohl promised east germans we will respect what 
you decide for the future 
the last such summit was sept 78 1987 in bonn when kohl met 
honecker the last time a west german chancellor visited east 
germany was in december 1981 when helmut schmidt met with honecker 
in werbellinsee

federal investigators are concentrating on a 
possible racial motivation in the two fatal mailbombings in the 
south over the past four days the justice department said thursday 
fbi director william sessions indicated that no suspect had been 
identified in the bombings as far as i know theres been no 
claimant of responsibility at all sessions said at a news 
conference at the justice department 
he said however that in the back of all of our minds is 
the possibility that the bombs were the result of racial feelings 
over desegregation cases 
mail bombs killed 11th circuit judge robert s vance at his home 
near birmingham ala on saturday and savannah ga alderman 
robert e robinson on monday in addition authorities removed 
bombs from a courthouse in atlanta on monday and from the naacp 
headquarters in jacksonville fla on tuesday 
vance recently wrote an opinion in a school desegregation case 
that was a victory for the jacksonville naacp 
attorney general dick thornburgh called the incidents an 
affront to our nations commitment to the rule of law 
he said in a statement that the investigation is currently 
concentrating on a possible racial motivation to the incidents 
which have occurred in the past four days 
thornburgh said he had contacted civil rights leaders to 
assure them that we are fully committed to the vigorous 
investigations of these crimes and the apprehension of the person 
or persons who perpetuated them 
he stressed however that no firm conclusion about 
motivation has been reached and sessions said i would not rule 
out drugs as potentially being involved but that is not a 
conclusion that can be reached at this time 
sessions said the bureau was studying vances court docket to 
determine if he participated in any cases that might have produced 
racial anger 
in september vance wrote the courts unanimous opinion that 
ordered the jacksonville fla schools to continue busing to 
achieve racial integration 
the case was won by the jacksonville naacp which had appealed a 
lower courts ruling that busing could stop 
an anonymous letter was sent from atlanta to a jackson miss 
television station in august declaring war on the 11th circuit the 
station wapttv reported tuesday night 
we turned it right over to the fbi said reporter deanna lee 
in a telephone interview lee said the letter bore an aug 21 
postmark the day before that a teargas cannister exploded at the 
naacp headquarters in atlanta injuring eight people 
fbi spokesman charles steinmetz confirmed that the fbi had 
opened an investigation into the letter soon after the television 
station had passed it along 
sessions said the fbi did not detect any similarity between the 
recent bomb incidents and activities of known white supremacist 
groups but it is something you cannot rule out 
we would hope the patterns of these types of groups when 
studied carefully and compared will yield fruit sessions said 
sessions ticked off a handful of federal agencies at work on the 
cases and offered blunt advice for anyone involved in the criminal 
justice system who receives a suspicious package dont try to 
open it 
i see no reason to panic but i see every reason to be 
cautious he said 
sessions brushed aside questions on the specifics of the case 
refusing to say whether the bombs were the work of experts whether 
the bomb to vance bore a postmark of newnan ga and what 
similarities if any existed among the bombs 
asked about the complexity of the bombs sessions indicated that 
they were not necessarily the work of explosive experts i would 
not comment about the specific devices themselves but laymen have 
been knwon to devise those kinds of instruments sessions said 
as for a positive racial motivation sessions said when the 
naacp headquarters receives a suspicious package an alderman is 
killed you have to have that in the back of your mind 
asked about a suspect the fbi director said 
i would not refer to any suspect at all if i had one at this 
stage 
but he did say he thought it was quite possible there is more 
than one person behind the crimes 
sessions said every available investigative resource is being 
utilized to lead authorities to the perpetrator or perpetrators 
of these horrible crimes 
in the meantime he said the us marshals service could keep 
judges safe and he appealed to all to exercise extreme care in 
opening suspicious packages to the point of advising them to call 
the return addressee to make sure a parcel was safe 
earlier tuesday authorities said the bombs that killed vance 
and robinson were both packed with nails suggesting links to the 
device sent to the atlanta courthouse 
theres a strong similarity in the three explosive devices 
and it appears there is a relationship fbi agent tom moore said 
in birmingham 
a government source in washington said the package containing 
the bomb that killed vance bore the return address of a another 
11th circuit judge lewis f morgan 
morgan who had previously sent packages to vance is not a 
suspect but the evidence suggests that the killer was famliar with 
the two judges friendship said the source who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
the bomb contained nails and injured the judges wife 
in savannah mayor john rousakis said authorities confirmed that 
nails also had been packed in the bomb that killed robinson who 
had represented the naacp in a longrunning desegregation lawsuit 
involving savannah schools 
the 11th circuit which considers federal cases from georgia 
florida and alabama had last month upheld the savannah school 
boards decision to change its desegregation plan 
the naacp had objected to the changes that were also approved by 
a federal district judge vance did not participate in that case 
according to julius chambers director of the naacp legal and 
educational defense fund inc 
the nine judges on the 11th circuit were under roundtheclock 
guard federal marshals said the bomb removed without incident 
from the courts atlanta headquarters on monday was addressed to 
the clerk of court 11th circuit government sources said

yasser arafat chairman of the palestine 
liberation organization came to jordan tuesday for talks on the 
proposal by us secretary of state james a baker iii for direct 
palestinianisraeli negotiations 
his twoday visit coincided with prime minister mudar badrans 
announcement that jordan was lifting martial law imposed 22 years 
ago after israel captured the west bank from jordan in the 1967 war 
i will brief king hussein on all that concerns our central 
issue the palestinian issue and developments on the 
palestinian arab and international arenas because we are in one 
trench arafat told reporters 
our relationship with jordan is beyond the level of 
coordination we are one family and it gives me pleasure to 
come to jordan at anytime 
badran and other cabinet members met arafat at the airport and 
all drove to the guest palace where hussein was expected to join 
them for talks 
arafat adviser bassam abu sharif told the associated press the 
talks will focus on concentrated efforts to open a 
palestinianisraeli dialogue in cairo and deal with israeli 
deviousness which tries to dampen and control all efforts for a 
peaceful political solution to the palestinian problem 
baker proposed in october that the meetings between palestinian 
and israeli delegations focus on israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamirs election plan for the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the election is part of a wider plan for a limited selfrule for 
17 million palestinians living under occupation the palestinians 
have been waging a bloody insurrection in the occupied lands since 
dec 8 1987 
the plo says it must name the palestinian delegation and the 
agenda must be open to all topics 
israel regards the plo as a terrorist organization and rejects 
any direct or indirect plo involvement 
badran affirmed jordans support for the palestinians saying 
we in jordan are all palestinians when it comes to the 
palestinian issue 
we support all the efforts of the plo because they work for 
the benefit of the palestinian cause 
in july 1988 hussein renounced sovereignty over the west bank 
turning over reponsibility to the plo 
more than half of jordans population of 3 million is of 
palestinian origin and badran is known for close ties with the plo 
in tunis the tunisian capital where the plo is headquartered 
the organization published a statement at the end of a threeday 
leadership meeting which said the united states unlimited 
support for the israeli leadership is hampering the peace process 
in the middle east region 
but it said it was ready to open a dialogue with the israelis on 
the basis of principles laid down in baghdad in october at the last 
meeting of the plo central council the plos right to pick 
members of the palestinian delegation and following the cairo talks 
with an international conference on peace in the middle east with 
the participation of egypt and sweden 
the lifting of martial law was the latest in a series of moves 
by prime minister badran and hussein aimed at liberalizing 
jordanian society 
badran also promised to crack down on corruption among public 
officials and criticized former governments for deficit spending 
that swelled jordans 83 billion foreign debt 
the newly elected 80member legislature adjourned after hearing 
the policy statement and a vote of confidence was set for dec 30 
badrans 23member cabinet which he formed dec 6 needs 41 
votes to be installed otherwise hussein will have to appoint a 
new prime minister 
most candidates in last months general elections had called for 
the lifting of martial law under which authorities can close 
newspapers at any time effectively inhibiting free criticism of 
officials 
martial law also banned large public meetings provided for 
special courts and allowed authorities to interfere in private 
business dealings and control bank transactions

president bushs nominee to head nuclear 
weapons production said tuesday that delays in a senate 
confirmation vote are undermining national security by prolonging a 
leadership vacuum in the arms program 
it is our country that is suffering as a result of senate 
inaction victor stello jr told the armed services committee at 
the close of a fivehour hearing it was the second time in five 
weeks that stello had testified to the panel 
the defense nuclear facilities are in a state of disarray 
stello said alluding to a series of safety and management crises 
at the weapons production plants that have forced many of the key 
facilities to close in recent years 
bush submitted stellos nomination to the senate on july 24 but 
the first confirmation hearing was not held midnovember when 
energy secretary james d watkins personally pleaded with the 
committee to approve the nomination quickly watkins said he needed 
stello to improve safety conditions at the arms plants 
the department has been without a confirmed head of weapons 
production for more than a year 
the committee tuesday heard sharply conflicting testimony about 
stellos qualifications for the job and about controversial actions 
he took during his more than two decades as a staff official of the 
nuclear regulatory commission which establishes and enforces rules 
on the commercial use of nuclear power 
sen james exon dneb acting chairman of the committee said 
the panel probably would meet in closed session shortly after 
congress reconvenes in january to decide when to vote on 
recommending either confirmation or rejection of the nominee 
fewer than half of the 20member committee attended tuesdays 
hearing most panel members have not said publicly whether they 
will vote for stello although at least three democratic members 
timothy wirth of colorado john glenn of ohio and edward kennedy of 
massachusetts are strongly opposed and all nine republican 
members are expected to support the nomination 
of the five former members of the nuclear regulatory commission 
who testified three strongly endorsed stellos nomination and two 
raised serious doubts about his suitability 
john ahearne who was a commission member from 197883 said the 
energy department needs somebody who is tough enough to force a 
turnaround in the management of the nuclear weapons facilities and 
that stello would fit the bill 
vic stello is the first name that would come to my mind as a 
good candidate for the job of assistant energy secretary for 
defense programs ahearne said 
peter bradford a commission member from 197782 said he was 
troubled by several allegations that have been made against stello 
since the time bradford left the agency including a charge that 
stello authorized an unusual cash payment to an informant in order 
to pursue a personal vendetta within the commission 
bradford said this and other allegations must be credibly 
disposed of by the senate before any confirmation vote is taken 
sen albert gore jr dtenn questioned a panel of former nrc 
investigators about stellos role in the investigations of the 1979 
three mile island nuclear power plant accident in pennsylvania the 
worst nuclear accident in us history 
john sinclair a former nrc investigator and now a member of the 
commerce department inspector generals office said under 
questioning from gore that stello had misled justice department 
investigators about the existence of cooling pipe test records held 
by the utility that operated the three mile island reactors 
that makes me think mr stello was more interested in making 
sure the company wasnt subject to any punishment than in 
protecting the public safety gore said im deeply troubled by 
this testimony 
sinclair and two other former nrc investigators jim mccarten 
and david gamble plus julian greenspun a former justice 
department investigator said in response to a question from exon 
that they would not recommend stellos confirmation 
in seeking to defend his actions following the three mile island 
accident stello tried to read from an fbi report but exon stopped 
him saying the reports contents could not be made public until 
the fbi agreed exon said the panel would seek to get that approval

the specialists at the north 
american aerospace defense command here who constantly scan the 
skies for enemy activity will take on additional duties here sunday 
night to watch for an old friend 
the radar satellites and spaceage sensors of norad will be 
watching for the unarmed subsonic sleigh of santa claus 
the procedure is laid down by tradition said air force maj 
dick adam of norad public affairs weve been doing it for so 
long its standard operating procedure for us by now 
norads tradition of tracking the jolly holiday visitor began in 
december 1955 early in the cold war as it monitored the dew 
distant early warning line of radars set up in greenland and 
canada 
when col harry shoup answered the hotline in the combat 
operations center one evening before christmas a small voice 
asked is this one of santas helpers 
shoup found that a newspaper advertisement had misprinted a 
telephone number for children to call santa printing the defense 
commands unlisted hotline number instead 
more calls poured in and soon the center was awash in christmas 
spirit 
an airman on duty soon drew santa with his sleigh and reindeer 
over north america on a glass plotting board used for 
displaying air traffic and another called the news media to report 
an object had lifted off from the north pole and was headed toward 
north america 
the airman reported jet fighters were being scrambled to 
intercept it and they later reported it was santa claus 
every christmas eve since then norad has found and escorted 
santa claus over north america

nicotine the drug inhaled by cigarette smokers 
can help reduce the symptoms of alzheimers disease psychologists 
reported tuesday 
giving nicotine resulted in the patients becoming more alert 
responding more vigorously and doing better on a variety of mental 
tests reading university psychology professor david warburton 
told the london conference of the british psychological society 
research carried out at london universitys institute of 
psychiatry by warburtons colleagues dr barbara sahakian and 
gemma jones matched 39 alzheimers patients with a healthy group 
of elderly people of the same age and intellectual ability 
compared with the effects of a placebo nicotine helped the 
patients suffering from premature senile dementia symptoms 
associated with alzheimers to be more alert the psychologists 
said however they said nicotine did not improve their memories 
alzheimers is a progressive disease characterized by 
degeneration of the brain cells 
warburton said he would not prescribe cigarettes to his patients 
my colleagues and i have never at any time recommended 
patients smoke cigarettes the psychologist said we were 
experimenting with safe ways of giving nicotine for example 
through a specially impregnated patch on the skin 
warburtons report was one of 150 papers presented at the 
twoday conference held at london universitys institute of

roger amp me a documentary about the 
devastating effects of general motors corp layoffs in flint 
preached to the converted tuesday at its premiere in this 
neighboring community 
spotlights jabbed snowfilled clouds outside the 14screen 
showcase cinemas in burton where all 14 screens showed the film 
produced directed by and starring journalist michael moore 
moore gave away many of the 4500 premiere tickets at united 
auto workers union local 599 where more than 10 percent of its 
15000 members are laid off from gm jobs 
there were boos and hisses when gm chairman roger smith appeared 
on the screen and cheers for uaw president owen bieber 
michael moore did this town a favor he gave us a voice in 
this world phil higgins 33 a chevrolet division metal 
fabricator from flint said as the crowd filed out 
he hit it right on the head said steve cockran 35 laid 
off after 13 years in quality control and production at gm 
the critically acclaimed film portrays moores fruitless efforts 
to interview smith about the elimination of 30000 gm jobs in flint 
and the resulting evictions and abandonment of entire neighborhoods 
in the city 
gm and city officials have countered that flint still has 45000 
gm employees the largest number anywhere 
moore said he hoped the film would stir political activism 
against sweeping job cuts by a company like gm which reported 5 
billion in profits in 1988 
how bout not closing down 10 factories and making only 3 
billion he said cant they be satisfied with that 
moore arrived at the premiere wearing a tweed jacket openneck 
shirt blue jeans and sneakers and apologizing about his limousine 
they made me ride in it he said as he entered the theater 
complex to address the cheering crowd 
we wanted to make this film so we can show people whats 
happening here moore said so not only flint but the rest of 
america would be concerned about the growing gap between rich and 
poor these days

a us soldier used an unauthorized weapon 
when he shot a panamanian police officer monday the pentagons 
spokesman said tuesday calling the incident very regrettable 
but saying it had to be considered in the context of a 
deteriorating situation 
what you have is a very difficult atmosphere in panama right 
now its very tense spokesman pete williams told reporters 
he said people there are afraid for their lives amid the tension 
that has followed two shooting incidents in recent days 
in panama according to nbc news c141 transports landed at 
howard air base at 10minute intervals throughout the afternoon 
these planes are the kind used to carry paratroopers in what the 
army said was a readiness exercise for elements of the 82 airborne 
division at fort bragg nc though it could not be determined 
whether the planes in fact came from fort bragg 
a reporter driving through the base tuesday evening saw at least 
10 large transport planes of an undetermined type an unusually 
large number and six to eight helicopters instead of the usual 
three or four 
at the pentagon williams said that although the army lieutenant 
was in an authorized area at the time of the shooting he was in 
civilian clothes and was carrying a sidearm 
asked if the officer had been authorized to do so williams 
answered i dont believe he was authorized to have a weapon 
the spokesman said the officer was still being questioned about 
the incident and he added you have to go back to the climate in 
which it happened 
the lieutenant says the panamanian reached for a weapon the 
spokesman said 
at the time us forces were on alert following the fatal 
saturday shooting of marine 1st lt robert paz 25 of dallas and 
the reported beating of a navy couple who us officials say 
witnessed the shooting 
president bush has refused to rule out military action against 
the government of gen manuel antonio noriega in response to the 
saturday shooting 
williams who said the army lieutenant was still in panama 
blamed the incident in part on noriegas friday declaration of a 
state of war with the united states 
people fear for their lives in panama right now williams 
said 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said 
noriegas irresponsible declaration of a state of war last week was 
followed only hours later by indiscriminate and unprovoked 
violence against americans clearly increases tensions in panama 
we find the unwarranted use of violence against americans by 
the noriega regime unacceptable she said 
williams said that us forces in panama are evervigilant 
they are acutely aware of the events that are taking place around 
them 
he said us officials are proceeding with caution as the go 
about their duties but he added we remain concerned about the 
situation in panama it appears to be deteriorating 
when asked about reports of preparations among the 18th airborne 
corps the spokesman said the unit periodically conducts 
emergency readiness deployment exercises to evaluate the readiness 
of its units currently elements of the 18th airborne corps 
are conducting emergency deployment readiness exercises 
on capitol hill sen richard lugar rind called on bush to 
issue an ultimatum to noriega telling him that continued 
antiamerican agitation will not be tolerated 
noriega appears to be testing the parameters of american 
tolerance said lugar a senior republican member of the senate 
foreign relations committee we need to avoid the appearance of 
acquiescence that might embolden noriega and lead to future 
american and panamanian casualties 
there are measured options military and otherwise that would 
inconvenience noriega and they ought to be considered promptly in 
the wake of unacceptable activities of the panamanian defense 
forces lugar said 
sen christopher dodd dconn the chairman of the senate 
foreign relations subcommittee on western hemisphere affairs said 
on nbctv that bush was correct in avoiding talking about a 
possible military response to noriega 
i think the presidents handling that question appropriately 
to not say exactly what youre going to do is probably the 
right thing to do dodd said 
the senator said that if the lives of us citizens in panama 
are jeopardized or if the canal were threatened those two 
situations would be two at least broad areas that would 
warrant at least further consideration of direct military 
intervention

parliament on tuesday approved the 
governments strict austerity program for next year but wrangled 
over budget cuts demanded by western creditors and has yet to adopt 
a budget 
negotiations with the international monetary fund for 
hardcurrency loans hinge on adoption of the budget the loans are 
needed to help transform the economy to work on market forces 
ernoe kemenes head of the national planning office told the 
hushed house that if it does not accept the austerity plan within 
months hungary would be unable to finance the economy and living 
standards would inevitably drop 
the budget deficit is likely to reach 800 million this year 
the imf wants that cut to 156 million in 1990 as a precondition to 
further loans 
a crucial 1 billion world bank loan hinges on the imf 
agreement as does a 114 billion loan from the european community 
kemenes said interest payments next year on the 20 billion 
foreign debt would amount to 15 billion payment on principal 
would stand at 19 billion 
kemenes said in his initial report on the government program 
that it foresaw cutting subsidies to lossmaking companies from 
109 billion to 308 million 
this would mean bankruptcy proceedings would be initiated 
against 50 firms premier miklos nemeth has said that could send 
the number of unemployed to about 100000 
the program also foresees hungary cutting back its trade with 
member countries of the sovietled comecon trading bloc kemenes 
said this would mean a cut of 20 percent in exports to these 
countries which in turn is likely to contribute to unemployment 
he said agreement also was with the imf on devaluing the forint 
finance minister laszlo bekesi said last week that if parliament 
rejects the budget the government would have no option but to 
resign 
a big item of controversy is the proposal to cut housing 
subsidies which now make up about 16 percent of the budget 
the plan envisages raising rents by 50 percent as of january and 
levying hefty taxes on those who enjoy low interest rates on 
homepurchase loans 
more than 20 deputies took the floor in the housing debate and 
all of them rejected the government proposal according to the 
official mti news agency 
the deputies argued that it was unfair to place such a burden on 
the population and could lead to serious political consequences an 
apparent reference to possible strikes and demonstrations 
the house adjourned debate tuesday and planned to vote 
separately on the housing issue wednesday before debating the 
budget 
this session of parliament is also to discuss the date for next 
years free elections the first multiparty elections in more than 
40 years

police on tuesday disarmed a parcel bomb at the naacp office in 
jacksonville fla the fourth in a series of mail bombs that 
killed an alderman in savannah ga and a federal judge in alabama 
us attorney general dick thornburgh said in washington that 
investigators were concentrating on a possible racial 
motivation for the rash of mail bombs that began saturday fbi 
director william sessions said an organized group might be involved 
savannah officials and the fbi confirmed that the parcel bomb 
that killed alderman robert robinson on monday was similar to those 
that killed 11th us circuit court of appeals judge robert s 
vance on saturday and forced the evacuation monday of the 
courthouse in atlanta that includes the 11th circuit 
an fbi agent said the alabama and georga bombs all had different 
postmarks phony return addresses and too many postage stamps 
elsewhere tuesday an anonymous caller threatened to kill a 
federal judge in alabama a package delivered to a birmingham 
ala city councilman who was a friend of vance was found to be 
harmless 
the national association for the advancement of colored people 
instructed its 1800 branch offices and seven regional offices to 
tighten security because the bombs might be racially motivated 
executive director benjamin hooks said from the organizations 
headquarters in baltimore 
the discovery of the parcel bomb at the naacps jacksonville 
office prompted police to evacuate and cordon off the building 
the bomb was disarmed inside the building with a device that 
disconnected the battery from the explosive officials said 
it was designed to kill the individual that opened this 
package or anyone else standing in the area said jacksonville 
sheriff jim mcmillan 
it had a great similarity in the packaging to the other 
bombs said willi ellison of the us bureau of alcohol tobacco 
and firearms it was addressed to no one specifically but to the 
legal staff of the naacp 
the bomb was to be taken to an fbi laboratory in washington and 
compared with the other devices ellison said 
the package arrived at the naacp office monday but had been 
left unopened a series of bomb threats and scares hit federal 
buildings around florida but no other explosive devices were found 
thornburgh said in a statement that he had contacted civil 
rights leaders to assure them that we are fully committed to the 
vigorous investigations of these crimes and the apprehension of the 
person or persons who committed them 
the fbi and thornburgh warned civil rights leaders judges and 
attorneys that the bombings may be racist attacks but the attorney 
general stressed there was no firm conclusion on motivation 
a pattern of racist attacks has to be one of the factors in 
the back of all our minds sessions told a justice department 
news conference he said the incidents have involved federal 
judges who have heard cases involving racial matters the naacp 
and a black civil rights activist 
sessions said it was quite possible more than one person was 
involved and that the bombs might be the work of an organized 
group he noted that the incidents had occurred in three states in 
the 11th circuit 
sessions said no one had claimed responsibility for the bombs 
robinson a civil rights activist and lawyer was fatally 
wounded by a mail bomb in his law office monday hours after the 
courthouse evacuation in atlanta 
although he was black a law colleague said there was little 
reason to figure him as a target of extremist bombers 
funeral services for vance will be held wednesday us supreme 
court justice anthony m kennedy who oversees the 11th circuit is 
expected to attend along with sessions and the attorney general 
fbi agent tom moore in birmingham said there were strong 
similarities between the three bombs 
fbi agent allen whitaker in birmingham said the georgia and 
alabama bombs came in similar packages but were mailed from 
different places 
there was not a common postmark whitaker said all had 
return addresses of different legitimate persons who had no 
connection with the packages 
he said the packages bore an excessive number of postage stamps 
apparently to protect the senders from a facetoface meeting 
with postal employees 
authorities in alabama said the bomb that killed vance sprayed 
nails and the atlanta constitution reported tuesday that the 
atlanta bomb also contained nails 
we believed nails were part of this bomb also and that has 
been confirmed said savannah mayor john rousakis he said he 
learned from the fbi that the savannah bomb bore a georgia return 
address presumed to be fake 
wapttv in jackson miss reported tuesday that it received an 
anonymous letter in august declaring war on the 11th circuit the 
letter was postmarked aug 21 one day a mail bomb teargas attack 
on the naacps atlanta offices 
we turned it right over to the fbi reporter deanna lee said 
in a telephone interview fbi spokesman charles steinmetz an 
investigation into the letter began soon after the television 
station had passed it along 
joseph lowery president of the southern christian leadership 
conference in atlanta said he received a call from thornburgh 
expressing concern over the possible racial motive in the bombings

he said they were very concerned about it there are reasons 
to believe that at least part of the motivation was racial 
lowery said were very concerned and i was pleased that he 
called 
fbi agent william hinshaw in atlanta said the naacps southeast 
regional headquarters in atlanta has been warned that the bombs 
appeared to be related to a aug 22 teargas mail bomb that 
exploded there injuring eight people 
in montgomery ala us marshal jim hudson said a federal 
judge received a telephone death threat early tuesday he would not 
identify the judge 
police in birmingham rushed tuesday to investigate a package 
mailed to councilman david herring a longtime friend of vance it 
turned out to be a delivery from an atlanta business 
meanwhile a government source in washington said the bomb that 
killed vance bore the return address of lewis f morgan a senior 
11th circuit judge in georgia morgan is not a suspect the source 
said but the discovery means the killer knew a great deal about 
vances personal habits and friendships 
links between vance and robinson are not readily apparent other 
than their moderatetoprogressive politics vance who was white 
became known as a racially progressive alabama democratic leader 
before being elevated to the federal bench while robinson was 
known as a moderate reasonable attorney and politician in 
savannah 
one of robinsons biggest cases as a lawyer did go before the 
appeals court he helped represent a black group fighting 
desegregation plans by the savannahchatham county schools which 
were approved by the 11th circuit court this fall 
but vance was not among the three 11th circuit judges ruling on 
the case 
it was a case that we lost it wasnt like robinson could 
have been accused of doing anything to upset the community said 
lowell johnston the lead attorney from the naacp legal defense 
fund who worked the case with robinson 
earlier this year the jacksonville naacp won from the 11th 
circuit a unanimous decision reinstating school busing in 
jacksonville overruling a lower court judge who had declared the 
school system was integrated vance wrote the opinion in that case 
vance 58 ruled in at least one other major racerelated case 
the 11th circuit in 1985 overturned a lower courts ruling and 
cleared the way for prosecution of 10 ku klux klansmen for a bloody 
may 1979 confrontation with black civil rights marchers in decatur 
ala after the ruling all 10 defendants pleaded guilty or were 
convicted 
the 11th circuit based in atlanta handles federal appeals from 
alabama georgia and florida authorities said the atlanta bomb was 
in a mailed package addressed to the 11th circuit court not to a 
particular individual

the government had clear evidence shortly 
after the first nuclear bombs were built in the 1940s that weapons 
workers were being exposed to potentially dangerous amounts of 
radiation according to a congressional report 
despite this information including some not previously made 
public officials overseeing the bomb factories recommended not 
informing workers of the possible health risks they faced at the 
secretly operated facilities the report said 
the us nuclear weapons program was exposing large numbers of 
workers to potentially dangerous health risks but did nothing to 
warn them said sen john glenn dohio in releasing the report 
on monday 
the report was prepared by the majority staff of the senate 
governmental affairs committee which glenn chairs the panel is

and abandoned children while serving as missionaries in haiti and 
came to love them so much theyve brought all 28 home to adopt 
it turned into a family and snowballed blackburn said as 
the couple arrived to a rousing welcome monday night at 
indianapolis international airport the blackburns and their 
children ages 3 to 14 headed for a church camp where theyll 
stay in a dormitory until they find a home 
the arrival of the christian evangelical missionaries and the 
children culminated two years of efforts by christian groups in 
this country to bring the family to the blackburns home state

jeff sagansky a senior program executive at nbc 
when it was rising from third to first in prime time ratings 
doesnt consider a similar rise impossible for cbs third for the 
last two seasons 
i think that cbs has got the same challenge that nbc faced 
in the early 80s says sagansky named as cbs entertainment 
president this week and now facing the considerable task of helping 
it escape the nielsen cellar 
i know having done that that it is doable he says a 
lot of people say oh its impossible but i know thats not the 
case 
at 37 picked from his wellpaid post as president of tristar 
pictures sagansky was nbcs vice president for series in 198385 
and helped develop cheers the toprated the cosby show and 
miami vice 
in succeeding kim lemasters who resigned as cbs chief 
programmer nov 30 after two years he now faces ratings combat 
with his former nbc boss brandon tartikoff who still is nbc 
entertainment president with abc with the upstart fox network and 
with the evergrowing cable monster 
with independent stations and videocassette players also 
battling for viewers attention sagansky has his work cut out as 
he notes theres a lot more competition now than when nbc made 
a comeback 
his philosophy for dealing with it all 
i think its a case of really targeting your development for 
specific time slots and having a sense of showmanship of putting 
shows on that intrigue viewers that make a splash that capture 
their attention 
the hardest thing to do now is to sort of cut through all the 
media clutter with a new show 
saganskys first task will be to consider a midseason schedule 
see which new series might replace fading ones and generally ready 
cbs for the february ratings sweeps 
thats one of four key periods of intense audience measurements 
each year in all tv markets local stations use the results to set 
advertising rates 
after sweeps preparations sagansky starts inspecting series 
pilots and other programs preparing for his first fall campaign 
he also has the weakrated the pat sajak show in late night to 
worry about 
despite the task facing sagansky his boss cbs broadcast group 
president howard stringer is optimistic were feeling fairly 
strong now he said but he wont forecast whether sagansky can 
help cbs avoid a third season as third in prime time ratings 
i dont want to put labels on it he said i dont want to 
put pressure on jeff the fact is that we preach patience more than 
we practice it 
the tv division of columbia pictures columbia owns tristar 
makes network programming including cbs designing women and 
the famous teddy z but stringer said no concessions or deals 
for future series were made for sagansky to be let out of his 
tristar contract which had a year to run 
in the course of negotiations with columbia he said all 
those who were new to columbia began to find out how much 
business were doing and the more they found that out the less 
difficult it became 
stringer called the talks an amicable series of discussions 
we were in a hurry but they didnt have to be 
sagansky cheerfully admits that many of his hollywood friends 
thought he had taken leave of his senses when he agreed to become 
the third cbs entertainment president in as many years 
but it was certainly the biggest challenge that id ever been 
offered and i didnt want to run away from it he said by phone 
from his cbs office in los angeles all my friends in the movie 
business said dont leave and all my friends in the television 
business said this is exactly the job you should be doing so it 
was sort of split 
but yes a lot of people thought i was nuts to do it

from the bluecollar housing projects 
of cockney east london to the gardens of the gentry grown men scan 
the skies for hours most weekends waiting for their pigeons to 
race home 
they rhapsodize about pigeon racing the sport known as the 
fancy and now one of britains more popular pastimes 
all you see is a pinprick in the sky said maj edward 
camilleri they fly toward you and you hope its yours then they 
fold their wings they drop out of the sky they literally do they 
come straight down like bullets 
says bernie bennett who has 60 pigeons unless youre a 
pigeon fancier you just find it very hard to understand to see a 
person out in the garden like me yesterday bucketing down with 
rain looking for pigeons to come from 100 miles 
with pigeons i find one thing and one thing only youre the 
jury youre the prosecution you are the judge all that happens 
down in your backyard is down to you 
camilleri a retired soldier who runs the royal pigeon racing 
association estimates britain has more than 200000 pigeon 
breeders and racers among its 56 million people 
nearly 2 million pigeons many with meticulously documented 
pedigrees dating back several avian generations are registered 
with camilleris association alone 
the sport has an honorable history the ancient egyptians kept 
pigeons hannibal took them over the alps they served in both 
world wars carrying messages for the allied intelligence forces in 
europe thirtyone pigeons were awarded the dickens medal the 
animal victoria cross in world war ii 
in britain pigeons were traditionally associated with 
beerdrinking clothcapped men but it has moved upmarket in 
recent years attracting lawyers actors and titans of industry at 
the top end of the scale queen elizabeth ii maintains a pigeon 
loft 
britains largest pigeon breeder louella pigeon world is a 
hightech enterprise that paid a world record 77000 pounds 
120120 in 1988 for the racing pigeon emerald ii 
that pound for pound makes it more valuable than the derby 
winner camilleri said referring to britains most prestigious 
horse race 
emerald ii is moved from one secret location to another because 
with the large sums sometimes at stake in bets and prize money 
sabotage and pigeonnapping are not unheard of 
however high prices dont always guarantee success camilleri 
said and a good racing pigeon can start as low as 20 pounds 32 
stockmanship comes into it knowing and understanding 
pigeons he explained they all have their individual 
characters and what youve got to do is understand their character 
well enough and encourage them to come home quicker than the next 
pigeon 
no one knows exactly how pigeons they find their way home after 
being released sometimes hundreds of miles away 
the sun is definitely one factor and magnetic field is 
definitely a second camilleri said research in europe indicates 
the sense of smell also may help 
theres also a very basic urge 
most pigeons in britain are kept on the widowhood system as 
soon as a hen and cock produce a pair of young or squeakers 
theyre separated only the males are raced and the only time they 
get to see their hens is when they return to the loft at the end of 
a race 
each fanciers loft is registered and the distance between it 
and any of the 200 official british liberation sites measured 
to the nearest yard 
pigeons are bundled into baskets sometimes the night before a 
race and taken to the liberation site in airconditioned trucks 
each wears a rubber band about the size of a wedding ring on its 
leg with the details of where it came from 
the pigeons are all released at the same time they ascend 
rapidly quickly become oriented and head for home 
when they land the fancier removes the rubber band and puts it 
in a timeclock that is sealed and taken to the local racing club 
the flight distance is divided by the time it took to determine who 
won the race 
what is it about pigeons that engenders such passion and loyalty 
the fascination about it you get a few pigeons you start 
winning races and from then on its a lot like horse racing only 
cheaper camilleri said 
you can pit your wits against nature

edward viii gave up his throne to marry wallis 
simpson 53 years ago but the romantic windsor legend has come 
alive again at their mansion in the bois de boulogne 
in early december the wroughtiron gates of the final and 
favorite residence of the duke and duchess of windsor were thrown 
open for a high tea given by mohammed al fayed the egyptian tycoon 
who paid more than 8 million to renovate the mansion 
the owner of the hotel ritz in paris and the harrods department 
store in london al fayed plans to keep the mansion open for 
friends and approved groups of visitors 
theirs was the love story of the century al fayed said of 
the windsors he undertook renovation with the blessing of mayor 
jacques chirac and the city of paris which is still the official 
owner of the villa 
al fayed said he had been shocked to see the dilapidated 
condition of the villa when he visited after the duchesss death in 
1986 with moldy walls and tags on the furniture and art objects 
destined for the auction block 
it was a sight i know would have appalled the duke and 
duchess he said having seen the villa in its heyday at a dinner 
party given by the duchess the american socialite divorcee whom 
the duke had married in defiance of the royal family 
so al fayed took things in hand supervised by an angloamerican 
team of decorators the leaky roof was repaired the interior was 
given a coat of paint tapestries and woodwork were restored 
personal valuables were left in place including framed intimate 
letters and photographs and silver and crystal on the diningroom 
table as if the windsors were expecting guests countless porcelain 
pug dogs around the house commemorate the windsors family pets who 
always were given pride of place 
i feel on top of the world said sydney johnson 69 the 
dukes personal valet for more than 30 years who is now 
occasionally in attendance dressed splendidly in gold and red 
livery as he was in the old days 
i cried all through the party mr al fayed gave three years 
ago to celebrate his lease on the house said johnson a bahamian 
who was hired during world ii when the duke was the governor of the 
bahamas the restoration is so authentic i expect to see the 
duchess stepping down the staircase asking how do i look 
also on hand are the windsors chauffeur of 20 years gregoire 
martin and his wife maria martin said he had hidden 5000 
personal photographs in a bathroom to keep them from prying eyes 
during the duchesss 14year widowhood following the dukes death 
in 1972 
the house looks as if the windsors just stepped out for a stroll 
in the bois books are at the bedsides brushes and combs are in 
the bathrooms and some of the duchesss lingerie are tidily wrapped 
in tissue in her dressing room 
the dukes bed has its original velvet cover with his prince of 
wales insignia and motto honi soit qui mal y pense which 
translates roughly as shame on him who thinks evil of it 
by his bedside sprawls a touching little chimneysweep rag doll 
cherished by the duke given to him by his mother queen mary who 
publicly disowned him after his indiscreet marriage 
the duchesss bedroom is a symphony of wallis blue and cream 
moire silk with attractive imitation louis xv and xvi furnishings 
and a priceless venetian l8th century marquetry chest visitors 
also see a raft of stuffed pug dog dolls and framed needlepoint 
works by the duke who loved needlepoint almost as much as golf 
commemorated in souvenir golf balls all over the place 
the duchesss bathroom is an artwork in itself decorated by 
dimitri bouchene a russian artist who designed stage sets for 
diaghilev and pavlova 
under a napoleonicstyle striped silk tent ceiling the bathroom 
walls are covered with bouchenes floral and animal murals with a 
group of his christmas cards framed in glass lining the doors like 
a gallery exhibition 
one of the villas first visitors was the britishborn actress 
joan collins who asked al fayed if he planned to use the house for 
his own parties 
i will indeed he said adding that he plans to keep the 
mansion staffed and open to small group visits by special request 
in 1991 he said he will send an exhibition of mementoes to 
london and other british cities as well as to new york and to the 
duchesss birthplace baltimore

although they happen simultaneously and go by the same name 
there are two types of chirstmas celebrations taking place these 
days the religious and the secular they mingle and also compete 
some people maintain the secular aspects have overshadowed the 
original religious purpose to the point of threatening to displace 
it thus undermining the sometimes complementary values of both 
were in danger of losing christmas says the rev john f 
macarthur jr pastor of grace community church in sun valley 
calif 
it may now be the biggest and most popular of all holidays 
but christmas is in jeopardy just the same a subtle but sure 
erosion is eating away the seasons true significance 
its significance is gods incarnation in the birth of jesus 
god with us mcarthur writes in a book of that title published 
by zondervan he says the essential is being obscured 
efforts both to secularize and to mythologize the christmas 
story are robbing it of basic meaning reducing it to little 
more than an elaborate fable he says 
most people dont know which details are biblical and which 
are fabricated he writes with facts lost in the mythology 
that has overgrown the account 
the story of jesus birth is no allegory but is rather an event 
in which god has given the greatest christmas gift of all time 
his identification with humanity mcarthur says 
he says secularizing influences also have eroded the real point 
of the celebration making it the ultimate holiday for committed 
hedonists with spiritual values smothered in crass 
consumerism 
drunken parties selfindulgence madcap spending and obscene 
gluttony all characterize the way much of the world celebrates 
christmas he says calling for reemphasis on worship and real 
joy and gladness 
he says some secular traditions the decorations family 
visits gettogethers with friends the exchange of gifts add 
to the joy of the season and theyre all legitimate including 
santa and his reindeer 
but he says the real underpinning of the holiday is crumbling 
under the secularizing tide and urges commitment to revitalizing 
that basic purpose 
the rev james m wall editor of the weekly christian century 
says the two christmases travel on parallel tracks but they 
offer dramatically different perspectives 
he points out the secular christmas draws on religious 
imagery to evoke emotions regarding giftgiving and selflessness 
and memories of home and the joy of receiving gifts 
but it never acknowledges a basic contradiction in its 
approach no gift ever delivers what we long for wall says 
what we long for is a connection to the eternal something no 
train set or bicycle can provide 
we encounter this disappointment as children but we continue 
to long for fulfillment when we hear the promises of the season 
when it is all over if we have been locked into the mindset of 
secular christmas we are left with the postchristmas depression 
in that sense wall writes editorially christmas can carry 
seeds of its own destruction put too much reliance on finding 
happiness in the event itself and you are doomed to disappointment 
the celebration of a religious event for secular purposes is 
bound to leave the human spirit unsatisfied 
neverthless he says society works energetically to uphold the 
secular christmas and crowd out the religious version 
the word that god became human is so absurd to the secular 
mindset that it must be greeted with an allout defense of the 
secular version of goodness and truth he says 
in responding to the ultimate mystery of gods revelation in 
history either we accept the gift and stand in awe that such a 
thing is possible or we vigorously deny even the possibility that 
ultimacy could embrace us in such a fashion wall adds 
if one is to insist that all truth is confined to the rational 
mode as the modern western mindset demands then the christmas 
event must either be viewed as a quaint fable or translated into a 
secular celebration 
but once the religious dimension fades the grounds for goodness 
are gone wall says and as a dostoevsky character warns 
everything is permitted or to paraphrase the cynical ebenezer 
scrooge 
christmas without a transcendent god is humbug

the 24hour church of elvis is here 
sharing space with the worlds cheapest psychic and a machine 
dispensing an eclectic collection of tacky prizes at a quarter a 
pop 
put a quarter in the slot and a computergenerated voice greets 
you 
hello welcome to wheres the art the worlds first 24hour 
coinoperated art gallery what would you like 
art 
stuffed into three storefront windows in downtown portland 
wheres the art is a repository of spinning talking and singing 
artifacts from american pop culture glitter garland and 
fluorescent colors abound 
there are the elvis presley shrine and the amazing new 
seethrough prizeomatic dispenser dispensing little gag prizes 
of obscure value 
i like to kind of shock people a little bit says 
ownerinventor stephanie pierce 
that helps explain why her certificate of admission to the new 
york bar hangs above her toilet 
pierce graduated from georgetown university law center in 1980 
and worked as a corporate lawyer for american telephone amp telegraph 
co in new york for three years 
people think they can dismiss me as a lunatic a member of the 
farout fringe but then they are really so impressed by the fact 
that i went to law school pierce says 
working on legal accounting issues just wasnt for her 
after she handed in her letter of resignation she says her 
boss george finkelstein said stephanie ill see you on 
the sidewalk begging for quarters good luck 
finkelstein was on target pierce often drums up business on the 
sidewalk outside her store she cajoles people who look but dont 
drop quarters in the slots 
when the quarter plinks into one of the coin slots the computer 
talks 
you can choose psychic counseling from dr justin d 
nikovtime sacraments in the church of elvis fun with the kid 
window or a parody of the game show lets make a deal 
all sorts of people come by this sidewalk arcade college 
students tourists street people businessmen on lunch breaks 
some just look others stop and put in quarters they all laugh 
thats one of the things i like the best making people 
laugh she says 
talk about participatory art the gallery marries couples in 
the church of elvis replete with plastic rings and elvis singing 
love me tender it conducts questionandanswer sessions with 
the psychic counselor and pushes people to dance with the 
stars right there on the pavement 
doing a pastlife regression the computer psychic might say 
you were a fish you were a bird you were shirley maclaine you 
were shirley maclaine you were shirley maclaine you were shirley 
maclaine 
after answering all the questions by pushing colored buttons 
the patient receives a prize perhaps a 3d psychic calendar 
or the handy horoscope which might include a prediction of an 
impending restaurant deal with reggie jackson pierce makes most of 
the prizes herself 
living in one window are a male mannequin with a 
paintbynumbers picture of a raccoon and a female mannequin 
wearing a sign that says dont hate me because im beautiful 
attached to her bizarre helmet is a vacuum hose that runs up from a 
contraption called the bowling channel brain stimulator 
this is art pierce says not whats found in traditional 
galleries thats why i call it wheres the art its not a 
question its a demand she says 
pierce 38 now revels in her place outside the art 
establishment but she did apply three times to cooper union for 
the advancement of science and art in new york the art samples she 
submitted included sketches of a dreaminator a machine that 
would allow people to record their dreams and play them back 
pierce was rejected but she says thats all right because not 
going to art school kept her on her own track 
i used to hide my strangeness all the time pierce says 
it was really a struggle i was trying so hard to be normal now 
i feel like im myself 
pierce traded in her business suits for leopardprint pants 
shorts tiedye shirts and wild hair 
she is host of a public access cable television show also named 
wheres the art the program which she calls a showandtell 
for artists and musicians is open to anyone and just about 
anything 
she has been making unusual pieces since childhood she and her 
brother and sister made little machines including one that was 
an early version of her current prize dispenser 
pierce says she made 42000 a year as a lawyer and piled up 
the tips as a waitress now she struggles to keep her store afloat 
her financial situation has improved dramatically since she began 
selling wheres the art tshirts until then she was five 
months behind on the rent 
business may improve further when pierce expands to mailorder 
delivery of the tshirts and possibly some of the prizes 
she says she makes about 600 a month in quarters she has to 
put up with frequent leaks in her store and duns for her 
delinquent student loan payments 
pierce works 12 to 15 hours a day but it doesnt feel like 
work she says im my own boss i dont make much money but it 
doesnt matter its a lifestyle

the wind blew and the earth shook and the wall came down 
there it is 1989 in review a year of disasters that rivaled 
old testament plagues of triumphs that challenged credulity a 
year that led people again and again to the same words i never 
thought id see the day 
for a while it seemed that this would be the year of the oil 
spill then the year of the hurricane then the year of the 
earthquake 
but the last turbulent year of the decade will be remembered 
finally as the year the iron curtain lifted 
twentysix years earlier john f kennedy had stood before the 
berlin wall and said of free citizens everywhere let them come 
to berlin in 1989 they came and from the least imaginable 
direction they came from the east 
what joy a west berliner exclaimed and people from east 
and west berlin danced and laughed and hugged atop a wall that no 
longer divided them 
we live in exciting times president bush observed the 
rapidity of change is mindboggling 
indeed it was 
in poland the solidarity trade union was illegal at the 
beginning of the year it had ousted the communist government by 
the end then came hungary east germany czechoslovakia one by 
one eastern europes ruling communist parties followed polands 
lead and agreed to step aside and allow democratic multiparty 
elections 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev had loosed the shackles 
that once bound eastern europe and after a seasick summit with 
bush in the tempestuous mediterranean he declared that the cold 
war was over 
images of eastern europes peaceful revolution will stick in the 
memory for a long time but so will a sadder picture a lone man 
standing before a phalanx of tanks near beijings tiananmen square 
it had been a hopeful spring in the square where tens of 
thousands of students demonstrated daily to demand democratic 
change military officers at first balked at suppressing the 
protesters 100 officers signed a statement saying the army will 
never shoot the people but on june 3 the army began shooting 
the people 
the death toll may never be known estimates ranged from 300 to 
3000 among the victims the hope for democratic change 
on a smaller scale too it was a year of tumultuous transition 
the tv lights went out for televangelist jim bakker who got a 
45year prison term for conspiracy and fraud 
zsa zsa gabor finally starred in a film that everyone remembers 
her trial on copslapping charges she played beverly hills 
official court jester and was rewarded with a conviction and jail 
term 
leona helmsley was the queen of a hotel empire but she was 
mocked and reviled outside her kingdom and was sentenced to four 
years in prison for tax evasion 
pete rose became as closely linked with betting as batting and 
agreed to a lifetime suspension from the game to which hed devoted 
his life 
john tower president bushs choice as secretary of defense 
lost the nomination and a sizable chunk of his reputation when he 
was pilloried as a liquortippling party animal 
house speaker jim wright resigned in a furor over outside 
income tom foley took his place 
time merged with warner sony merged with columbia mike tyson 
split with robin givens 
the years obituaries noted the passing of both famous and 
infamous 
irving berlin and bette davis lucille ball robert penn warren 
salvador dali vladimir horowitz herbert von karajan laurence 
olivier mel blanc 
ferdinand marcos ayatollah khomeini emperor hirohito abbie 
hoffman rep claude pepper 
sugar ray robinson a bartlett giamatti secretariat 
mass murderer ted bundy was put to death other killers died at 
their own hands they included patrick purdy who killed five 
schoolchildren in stockton calif joseph wesbecker who killed 
eight people in a printing plant in louisville ky and marc 
lepine who systematically gunned down 14 women engineering 
students in montreal 
ramon salcido allegedly killed his wife two daughters and four 
other people near santa rosa calif before fleeing to mexico he 
was captured five days later and awaits trial in california 
more than 20000 americans died of aids scientists continued 
searching for a vaccine and a cure and the government tried to 
find new ways to make experimental drugs available more quickly 
people worried about homelessness and hunger abortion and child 
care flagburning and the greenhouse effect 
the mosthonored movie of the year rain man suggested 
that the me decade ethic might be softening it was the story 
of a fasttalking wheelerdealer from southern california who found 
some measure of humanity in caring for his autistic brother 
then again the grammy award for best song went to bobby 
mcferrins dont worry be happy 
historically speaking the year began on a chilly cloudy day in 
january when george bush took the oath of office as the 41st 
president of the united states 
a new breeze is blowing he declared in his inaugural 
address and a nation refreshed by freedom stands ready to push 
on there is new ground to be broken and new action to be taken 
if presidencies are defined by symbols and styles bush set out 
to cast his as open informal active sort of an aerobic teddy 
roosevelt he opened the white house to the public the day after 
his inauguration he met with the press far more frequently than 
did president reagan and he seemed at times to be cultivating an 
image as the triathlete president jogging golfing fishing 
speedboating playing tennis tossing horseshoes tussling with 
grandchildren

some day some year congress may get serious 
about trimming the sprawling network of offices maintained by the 
agriculture department that reaches into virtually all of the 
nations 3150 counties 
various administrations and usda analysts have been saying for 
44 years that a remodeling is long overdue the general accounting 
office says its time for another try 
most senior usda officials we spoke with and many studies 
over time recognize the need to streamline usda particularly its 
field structure says the gao the investigative arm of congress 
but the gao which is still studying how to make the department 
leaner and more effective says grassroots ties with congress and 
specific usda agencies have kept the department from adjusting to 
changes in the real world 
the structure of usda is formidable there are 36 agencies in 
the department that carry out policies and programs in 1988 for 
example usda spent more than 44 billion and employed more than 
110000 fulltime people in more than 15000 places around the 
world in addition finances funds more than 17000 county office 
employees 
despite dramatic changes in the agribusiness sector usdas 
basic organizational structure has changed ittle the gao said in 
a recent interim report to agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
its agencies are tradition bound and highly resistant to change 
the department still maintains a multibilliondollar 
1930sdesigned field delivery structure although todays farmers 
are far fewer in number and operate in a global agribusiness 
environment it said 
a final report by gao is in the works and will include specific 
recommendations for improving operations 
but inefficiencies of usdas huge administrative apparatus are 
hardly news each year congress has the opportunity in the 
appropriations process to review costs and how they are handled 
each year congress hears grumbles from one group or another about 
usda bumbling in the administration of various programs 
additionally as congress is doing now it can modify or design 
new programs during the development of farm legislation the 1985 
law for example expires next year and lawmakers are trying to put 
together a new package 
what it boils down to in many cases is the fear of many rural 
communities usually county seats that they may lose their usda 
offices sometimes the biggest job source in town 
most of usdas farm service agencies were established during 
the 1930s in response to the great depression the gao report 
said in that era communication and transportation systems 
limited the geographic boundaries covered by any single field 
office 
because of these and other reasons usda established a highly 
decentralized field office system to serve the large number of 
small widely dispersed family owned farms from 1932 to 1948 
usda employment grew from 22000 to 79000 
the gao review included a look at a number of department 
agencies including the agricultural stabilization and conservation 
service ascs farmers home administration fmha soil 
conservation service scs and extension service es 
according to the review the ascs and scs maintain offices in 
about 85 percent of the nations 3150 counties the fmha has 
offices in more than 60 percent and the es has them in nearly all 
of the counties 
in all the four agencies operate approximately 10600 county 
offices additionally the federal crop insurance corp operates 
through a network of government office and private insurance agents 
who are often located close to or with one or more of existing 
usda field offices the report said 
although gao found many senior department officials agreeing on 
the need for streamlining the delivery system for farm programs 
most thought it too difficult politically 
for example two officials who believed the current structure 
was costly and ineffective and needed to be changed also believed 
such change would be politically unpalatable and too disruptive 
the report said 
as early as 1945 proposals were made to streamline usdas field 
structure the gao said and there have been eight major studies 
the past 20 years 
of the various kinds of streamlining gao found collocation 
of offices under one roof which leaves the structure generally 
intact to be the most successful 
collocating offices often reduces program delivery costs 
through sharing equipment technical expertise and tasks the 
report said program recipients also benefit by being able to 
transact all their usda business in one location 
in a 1985 study the department found that ascs scs fmha and 
es were totally collocated in 1982 in 476 counties not counting 
es the agencies were collocated in 1438 counties 
however the report stated that from 1982 to 1985 collocated 
offices were separating more frequently than offices were 
collocating and that collocation did not necessarily lead to 
increased cooperation among the agencies the gao said 
moreover it said usda no longer tracks collocations in the 
detail needed for management to determine the extent to which 
counties are collocated

guinness peat aviation the irelandbased aircraft leasing firm 
will own 30 percent while the west german airline lufthansa and 
the swiss airline swissair will own 35 percent each of shannon 
aerospace ltd the company formed to construct operate and own

construction of the 300000 square foot aircraft overhaul and 
maintenance center will begin this spring at the airport on 
irelands west coast the companies said monday 
the new company will start operations in late 1992 with an 
initial work force of 350 which the partners said should rise to 
1000 by the mid1990s 
the facility will have two maintenance bays one for boeing 
b737s and the other for mcdonnell douglas md80s there will be an 
aircraft painting hangar to accommodate the largest planes

marriott corp says it will restructure its 
business to focus on its profitable hotel and service segments and 
jettison its weaker fastfood and family restaurant divisions 
the nations largest hotel company also said monday it would 
reorganize its corporate staff and lay off an asyet undetermined 
number of workers marriott said the restructuring would result in 
as much as 325 million in pretax charges against its 
fourthquarter earnings 
the company also announced the planned repurchase of 10 million 
of its shares 
mondays announcement marked the third time this year that a 
major hotel company said it would pare its businesses to a core 
group ramada inc and holiday corp have already begun their 
restructuring plans 
marriott chairman jw marriott jr said his companys 
restaurants could not keep pace with the growth rate of its hotels 
and contract services divisions he said he hoped overall profits 
would grow 15 percent to 20 percent as a result of the 
restructuring 
we couldnt do both marriott said at a news conference at 
his companys marquis hotel here we decided to concentrate on 
hotels and contract services 
opportunities for restaurant growth have been limited by 
increasing competition from pizza and other fastfood chains and by 
a growing tendency for americans to eat at home marriott said 
marriott said the company based in washington dc would 
retain its restaurants at airports and on turnpikes those 
operations would be combined with marriotts contract services 
division which supplies hotel management and food services to 
institutions and companies 
marriott also said his company would continue to expand its 
retirement community division it currently has 12 communities and 
hopes to have 150 within five years he said 
theyre getting rid of some of their worst businesses said 
daniel lee an analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc these are 
slowgrowing capital using businesses which had held back the 
corporate growth rate 
despite praise for the moves by some analysts marriott stock 
slipped in new york stock exchange trading falling 1 a share to 
close at 3362 
the company also announced it had completed the sale of its 
airline catering division to the units senior managers for 570 
million that sale was expected to yield more than 200 million 
after taxes which would partially offset the costs of the 
restructuring jw marriott said 
marriott said it would sell its 358 companyoperated roy rogers 
fastfood restaurants in the middle atlantic states in the first 
quarter of 1990 those stores were expected to register about 400 
million in sales this year 
marriott also said it intends to sell the 434 units operated by 
its family restaurants division including 235 bobs big boy 79 
wags 31 bickfords 57 howard johnsons and 32 allies 
restaurants in total these restaurants had 1989 anticipated sales 
of about 440 million 
the sale of allies represented a defeat for marriott lee said 
the company had hoped to convert many of its other family 
restaurants to allies but was forced to abandon the idea 
unlike ramada and holiday marriott does not plan major hotel 
divestitures ramada sold its hotels and restaurants to concentrate 
on its gambling operations and holiday has sold its wellknown 
holiday inn hotels and focused on its casinos and newer hotel 
chains 
the hotel companies said they wanted to channel their resources 
into their most profitable or expandable businesses 
james murren an analyst with cj lawrencemorgan grenfell 
said the slowing economy is one factor behind the restructurings 
that squeezes all competitors and forces them to review their 
business portfolio he said 
in addition the hotel firms have broadened and diversified 
away from core businesses and found those talents were not 
necessarily transferable murren said 
sarah sheckler an analyst with duff amp phelps in chicago said 
of marriott at least 50 percent of their profits come from 
lodging and theyre focusing on their higher growth businesses 
marriott said the stock buyback would be accomplished as soon as 
possible the company said it has repurchased 32 million shares or 
24 percent of its common stock over the past three years leaving 
104 million outstanding 
marriott has projected 1990 sales of 75 billion in its third 
quarter the company reported earnings of 63 million up 9 percent 
from a year earlier on revenue of 193 billion 
besides its flagship marriott hotels the company also owns or 
operates courtyard residence inn and fairfield inn hotels its 
food service operations include host howard johnson and hot 
shoppes outlets

securities and exchange commission chairman 
richard c breeden says hed like to see federal futures law 
repealed or modified to prevent interagency squabbles over new 
financial products 
breeden used a news conference monday on cooperation agreements 
with french and dutch securities regulators to repeat his complaint 
about jurisdictional disputes with the rival commodity futures 
trading commission 
such disputes were keeping new hybrid financial products 
in the courthouse instead of in the marketplace while foreign 
exchanges were trading in similar products said breeden 
he suggested repealing or amending the commodity exchange act 
which governs the futures industry to let the markets decide 
where the products will be most actively traded 
breeden also announced he is creating an office of international 
affairs to coordinate enforcement cooperation with foreign stock 
regulators 
the new international affairs office will be headed by michael 
d mann now an associate director for international affairs in the 
secs enforcement division 
breeden said the new office which will be responsible for 
negotiating formal cooperation agreements known as memoranda of 
understanding underlines the very high priority the commission 
places on international cooperation 
while the sec is concerned a great deal about maintaining 
regulatory cooperation said breeden we at the commission are 
also very concerned about competitive issues 
hybrid products are securities with elements of commodity 
futures or futures with elements of a security earlier this year 
a federal appeals court in chicago ruled the sec overstepped its 
authority when it approved trading in a type of hybrid instrument 
known as an index participation or ip 
ips which have been likened to baskets of stocks may not be 
traded in us markets until the dispute which is still in the 
courts is resolved 
breeden first spoke out against the jurisdictional disputes to 
securities lawyers last month in washington 
such litigation delays are a direct threat to american 
competitiveness in the financial trading markets breeden said 
monday our foreign competitors have not imposed this type of 
restriction on themselves 
he cited a recent story in the financial times of london that a 
consortium of european business people planned to offer a stock 
basket product similar to the one blocked in the united states 
breeden said that early next year we hope to work together 
with the cftc and discuss with congress ways of moving this 
unneccessary barrier to our competitiveness 
david gary a cftc spokesman said monday we will be meeting 
and have been meeting with fellow regulators particularly the sec 
we feel there are a number of questions that relate to the 
financial services industry we are more than willing to sit down 
and discuss them but we want to see them answered with the big 
picture in mind futures are not isolated by themselves 
last week breeden signed cooperation agreements with dutch and 
french securities regulators that will allow the exchange of 
information to help stamp out insider trading and other market 
abuses 
breeden said monday he would travel to japan in midjanuary as 
part of an ongoing series of visits both countries have exchanged 
since signing a limited cooperation agreement in 1986 
breeden who was sworn into office in october said he expected 
the talks would cover enforcement topics as well as capital rules 
disclosure and other matters 
on another matter breeden declined to discuss when he would 
name a director to head the secs enforcement division

a trade group representing savings and loan 
holding companies is complaining about new rules that prohibit sampls 
from releasing mailing lists of their customers names without 
permission from their customers 
the rules imposed by the office of thrift supervision provide 
that a name and address may be given out only if the customer is 
first notified and does not object within 15 days after two years 
the customer must be asked to renew the permission 
the prohibition took effect friday 
the association of thrift holding companies in a suit filed in 
us district court seeking to overturn the regulations complained 
that the rules make it difficult for thrift parent companies such 
as insurance companies and banks to crossmarket their products to 
the thrifts customers 
banks do not operate under similar restrictions and imposing the 
limits on sampls likely will hurt the governments efforts to dispose 
of failed thrifts the trade group said financial institutions 
earn money by selling their mailing lists to others 
however thrift office director m danny wall said in a 
statement the regulation strikes a reasonable balance between 
customers expectations of privacy and legitimate business 
interests of thrift institutions 
he acknowledged that in most states the rules will now be 
tougher for sampls than for banks but said we think thats a 
positive step and gives the public an incentive to place their 
business with thrifts 
the regulation has exemptions allowing customer information to 
be disclosed to regulatory officials law enforcement officials and 
creditreporting agencies

a panel of experts called in by a research 
organization to make recommendations on us trade policy failed to 
reach a consensus and instead was forced to issue two separate 
reports mirroring the deep divisions in the current debate over 
trade issues 
officials of the twentieth century fund said monday it was the 
first time that a panel of experts convened by the nonprofit 
research organization had failed to reach enough agreement to issue 
a single report 
instead the panel split 75 with seven experts advocating free 
trade and five other panel members supporting what some have called 
a managed trade approach to the nations huge trade deficits 
the depth of feeling on both sides emerged during a sometimes 
heated news conference the panel held to unveil their separate 
reports 
those arguing for free trade asserted that the trade policies 
established by the general agreement on tariffs and trade the 
genevabased organization which governs world trade should not be 
tampered with because they had served the global economy well for 
almost four decades 
we are the worlds leading exponent of the freemarket system 
whose triumph we are now celebrating said herbert stein former 
chairman of the council of economic advisers in the nixon 
administration we should not retreat into fearful isolationism 
the minority group on the panel argued that the huge trade 
deficits during the 1980s and the united states new status as the 
worlds largest debtor country showed that more must be done to 
attack the huge trade imbalances 
clyde prestowitz a former commerce department trade official in 
the reagan administration argued that freetrade advocates were 
ignoring the fact that trade to a large extent was being managed at 
the present time he said much of the japanese success stemmed from 
that governments active involvement in assisting emerging 
technologies 
traditional freetraders argue that it is not important 
whether your industry makes computer chips or wood chips but we 
believe that the composition of industry in a country is 
important said prestowitz now a senior associate at the 
carnegie endowment 
advocates of a more aggressive trade policy argued that the 
united states should establish a goal of erasing the countrys 
annual trade deficit by 1993 the broadest measure of trade the 
current account was last in surplus in 1981 the deficits have 
been stuck above 100 billion for the past five years 
stein said efforts to protect certain us industries against 
trade competition would end up costing consumers who must pay 
higher prices for products he said proposals for the government to 
pursue an industrial policy by picking winners and losers in 
emerging technologies was also illconceived 
the notion of turning the united states economy over to a 
government agency is ludicrous he said 
the members of the task force who signed the freetrade report 
were stein anne krueger economics professor at duke university 
lawrence j brainard senior vice president at bankers trust co 
harry l freeman executive vice president american express co 
paul krugman economics professor at the massachusetts institute of 
technology robert z lawrence senior fellow at the brookings 
institution and gary hufbauer professor at georgetown university 
joining with prestowitz in the opposing report were patrick d 
choate vice president for policy analysis at trw inc robert 
kuttner economics editor at the new republic howard d samuel 
with the industrial union department at the aflcio and alan

the european community angered by us 
efforts to circumvent a ban on hormonetreated beef has asked the 
united states to slash retaliatory duties imposed in the trade 
dispute an official said 
the official said monday that the 12nation trading bloc wants 
the tariffs reduced because of legislation requiring us 
commissaries in europe to buy their beef from american not 
european producers commissaries are stores for us military and 
other personnel 
the official who demanded anonymity said the purchases plus 
transportation costs were expected to amount to about 55 million 
which he described as an extra penalty applied by the americans 
in the dispute 
the united states slapped duties of about 100 million on a 
variety of european products to retaliate for the ban on imports of 
meat from cattle treated with growth hormones some of the duties 
have been eased slightly since the prohibition went into effect 
last jan 1 
frans andriessen the ecs top trading official and ray 
macsharry its agriculture chief requested the tariffs be lifted 
in a dec 1 letter to us agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
and us trade representative carla hills no response has yet been 
received 
foreign ministers of the 12 community nations discussed the 
dispute at a meeting monday and asked to be kept informed of the 
american reaction the official said 
the banned meat affects only a tiny part of the 166 billion in 
1988 trade between the trading partners 
the community official also said the trading bloc was 
considering accepting the conclusions but not critical findings of 
an international trade panel that ruled in favor of the united 
states in a dispute over soybean subsidies 
the official said the community would be willing to do so 
provided that the united states refrained from imposing unilateral 
trade measures violating international trade rules 
last week a panel of the 97nation general agreement on tariffs 
and trade found that community subsidies to processors and 
producers of soybeans hurt trade details of the soybean decision 
have not been released 
us soybean producers complained in december 1987 that 
community subsidies had cut into american exports to europe the 
american soybean association argued that the payments encouraged 
farmers to grow oilseeds which then reduced the demand for 
american imports 
the community argued the erosion of the european market was 
largely due to increases in cheaper imports from brazil and 
argentina

eastern airlines has revived a plan to shrink 
its operations by about a third telling creditors it expects to 
sell its valuable latin american routes 
at a meeting with major creditors monday in new york eastern 
officials also projected a net loss of 250 million for the fourth 
quarter they presented creditors with a revised business plan that 
takes into account the sale of the latin american routes 
the plan reverts to an april proposal for restructuring eastern 
at about twothirds its prestrike size with the latin american 
routes the airline would have remained at 80 percent to 90 percent 
of its original size 
the sale of the routes is being negotiated but no deal has been 
struck with the potential buyer rival american airlines 
we are in intense negotiations with eastern but a deal has not 
yet been completed said al becker a spokesman for american at 
its headquarters in fort worth texas he refused to elaborate 
according to a report monday in the wall street journal eastern 
tentatively agreed over the weekend to sell the latin american 
routes and other assets to american for 450 million to 500 
million 
eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak declined to comment on the 
journal report eastern has not named american the nations 
largest carrier as the interested party 
the new york times reported today that eastern agreed to sell 
the routes to american for almost 350 million 
in another sign of its ambition to expand american announced 
separately monday an agreement to buy from trans world airlines its 
chicagotolondon route and four gates at chicagos ohare 
international airport for 195 million 
miamibased eastern has been working on a reorganization plan 
since filing for bankruptcy court protection march 9 five days 
after being crippled by a strike sales of other assets totaling 
about 688 million already have been approved by us bankruptcy 
judge burton r lifland 
negotiations with american which has coveted the latin american 
routes for its expansion plans stalled in august eastern 
initiated new talks about two months ago amid concerns about cash 
shortfalls in its rebuilding plan 
eastern has delayed presenting a new reorganization plan to 
creditors while the negotiations have continued the airline hopes 
to emerge from chapter 11 early next year 
if eastern can sell the routes it puts the reorganization 
plan back on schedule said kevin murphy an airline analyst at 
morgan stanley amp co 
the officials also told creditors that eastern will be an 
airline in transition between january and june of next year in 
addition to selling the latin american routes they said eastern 
will continue to build up atlanta as its hub and dehub miami 
to reduce caribbean operations and to retire its 14 lockheed 
l1011s 
eastern expects to post a fourthquarter net loss of 250 
million widened from a loss of 1852 million in the third 
quarter said the officials led by president phil bakes next 
year the carrier expects to turn a modest net profit in the 
second half and a net loss for 1990 of 90 million 
the improvement in the second half will result from refocusing 
on the atlanta hub reducing expenses and expanding revenue the 
officials said 
the sale of the latin american routes was envisioned in 
easterns original business plan presented to creditors last april 
the idea was scrapped in a later plan after talks with american 
stalled 
the journal report monday citing unidentified sources said 
american would get easterns south american and caribbean routes 
plus gates and landing sites at various airports american also 
would obtain some other assets of easterns parent texas air corp 
including continental airlines miamilondon route the report said 
the journal reported that the weekend agreement came about after 
continental agreed to settle a longstanding lawsuit against amr 
corp americans parent that suit sought as much as 1 billion in 
damages and alleged that americans computer reservations system 
gave american an unfair advantage 
the times citing an unidentified source said continental would 
agree not to bring another suit over its contention that americans 
reservation system which is used by travel agents favors american 
flights over those of other carriers 
the sale of international routes must receive government 
approval as well as that of the bankruptcy court 
also at the meeting monday the officials told creditors that 
eastern will ask lifland for an extension of the dec 29 deadline 
for submitting its revised reorganization plan the judge already 
has given the airline several such extensions

a light sentence of three years probation for 
admitted stock manipulator salim b sandy lewis is another sign 
that on wall street it pays to settle 
lewis pleaded guilty to three counts of securities violations 
rather than face trial and was sentenced monday to work in a new 
york drug rehabilitation clinic and pay a 250000 fine rather than 
go to prison 
some securities law experts said the term appeared fair for 
lewis crime jacking up the price of firemans fund corp stock 
in may 1986 but raised the question of whether whitecollar 
felons were being treated too leniently 
in her sentencing speech us district judge mary johnson lowe 
told lewis that your skills should not be wasted in warehousing 
you she also said his admission of guilt was a mitigating factor 
where you run into problems is the kid who sells a little 
marijuana or cocaine and gets three years said alan bromberg a 
securities law professor at southern methodist university im 
not sure hes doing any more social harm its just that hes not 
capable of doing as much social good 
lewis was ordered to work 40 hours a week for one year at daytop 
village a manhattanbased drug rehabilitation clinic he must work 
20 hours a week at the clinic in the second and third years of his 
probation lewis will work at daytop as an executive consultant 
the idea to work there was his 
boyd l jefferies the former los angeles stockbroker who 
identified lewis as part of a plea deal in which he cooperated with 
the government in july was sentenced to five years probation and 
community service and fined 250000 
two other figures in the wall street scandals still await 
sentencing after pleading guilty to securities crimes former 
takeover strategist martin siegel and former stock arbitrager 
robert freeman 
observers said the lewis case could bear on sentencing gaf corp 
vice chairman james t sherwin who was convicted last week of 
stock manipulation in a case also before lowe sherwin has done 
extensive work for a refugee relocation agency as lewis had worked 
with drugaddiction agencies and the poor 
lewis 50 a prominent wall street veteran had faced up to 15 
years in prison and a 750000 fine his firm sb lewis amp co 
was fined 400000 for violating federal securities laws 
the stock manipulation raised the value of firemans fund stock 
immediately before a longtime lewis client american express co 
sold a large amount of shares in a new public offering 
american express which invested 4 million to help lewis start 
his brokerage in 1980 was never charged and there is no proof 
that it or lewis profited from the manipulation but under federal 
securities laws profit isnt necessary to commit a crime 
lewis maintained he was not motivated by greed but by a desire 
to punish rival speculators attempting to bid down the price of 
firemans fund in anticipation of the new stock offering the 
government disagreed 
lewis attempts to portray himself as a misguided watchdog of 
the markets are simply not supported by the facts which show 
instead a straightforward market manipulation designed to assist a 
close business associate american express prosecutors said in 
court papers 
columbia university securities law professor john c coffee jr 
said lewis contention that no one was harmed in the manipulation 
was misplaced 
people were buying these securities as a price that was 
inflated and artificial he said 
prosecutors alleged that at lewis request jefferies bought 
more than 400000 shares of firemans fund on may 8 1986 
successfully driving its price up 12 cents to 38 a share 
a day later american express announced it would sell 8 million 
shares of its 41 percentowned firemans fund at 4150 a share a 
new stock offering that had been widely expected 
prosecutors said american express made 88 million from the sale 
but they never offered evidence that any of that profit was tainted 
by what lewis did

trans world airlines inc pilots are calling a 
planned 195 million sale of assets to american airlines the first 
step in a liquidation 
twa chairman carl icahn warned that other asset sales are 
possible after mondays announcement that the airline had agreed to 
sell to american its chicagolondon route a maintenance hangar and 
four gates at ohare international airport 
icahn in a letter to twa employees said the deal was designed 
to help restore twa to profitability and give the company extra 
cash in case of a protracted slump 
leaders of the twa branch of the air line pilots association 
blasted the deal saying it would further alter the balance of 
power in the industry kent scott chairman of the unions 
executive council in st louis twas hub city said the pilots 
would try to block the deal which requires government approval 
there is no possible way that twa can get stronger if it gets 
smaller scott said we think that this is just a first step in 
a controlled liquidation of twa 
in our view this is not just an isolated sale of a route that 
doesnt fit into the twa route system as carl icahn would like to 
portray it he said 
analyst paul turk who follows the industry for avmark inc 
agreed with the pilots 
any diminution of twas overseas operation is probably not a 
good sign not for the longterm health of the airline turk 
said 
a spokeswoman for the independent federation of flight 
attendants said her union also opposed the sale 
we would be very disappointed to lose the routes said joan 
wages a legislative representative in washington dc im sure 
that the department of transportation will look very closely at 
this 
icahn who has been rumored to be seeking buyers for the 
airline did not identify which assets may be sold twa spokesman 
don morrison declined to elaborate 
it is clear that twa can no longer afford to make investment 
decisions based on traditional thinking icahn said there are 
unprofitable assets at twa which have been untouched purely because 
of tradition these assets if sold could put us on the road to 
profitability 
icahn saying only three or four major airlines will exist by 
the mid1990s said he would use twas cash to expand 
internationally including applying for permission to fly to tokyo 
from st louis 
but he said twa was not having financial difficulty 
twa currently has over 700 million in cash and i hope within 
the next several months to have well over 1 billion icahn 
wrote saying twas investments added 500 million to the airlines 
books in realized and unrealized gains 
this cash reserve will help protect twa from the economic 
downturn that i have been predicting and that is already occurring 
in our industry icahn said 
icahn a billionaire corporate investor was twas white 
knight in 1986 buying the airline in a 440 million deal to 
thwart an attempted takeover by frank lorenzos texas air corp 
twa based in mt kisco ny is the nations eighthlargest 
carrier 
the sale gives american the no 1 carrier a second london 
route the airline a unit of amr corp has flown to london from 
dallasfort worth international airport since 1982 
the deal leaves twa with three gates in chicago morrison said 
the transaction is dependent upon twa losing enough money this year 
to negate clauses in its agreements with its pilots union 
david berkley a spokesman for the pilots said the intent of 
the agreements were to give icahn a chance to sell assets only as a 
lastditch effort to save the company 
what we didnt foresee was the methodology icahn used to take 
the company private berkley said privatization is directly 
responsible for the losses in the air he put so much debt on twa 
and extracted so much cash that it negatively affected operations 
while american was buying the twa holdings an expected 
announcement on a multimilliondollar expansion into latin america 
did not materialize published reports said american would by 
eastern airlines caribbean routes monday but no deal was 
announced 
during the past year american has worked on expanding its 
international business adding european and pacific rim flights

yearend holidays will be longer than usual for 
107700 autoworkers as manufacturers try to bring production in 
line with slowing demand 
that news came monday as ford motor co joined chrysler corp in 
a new round of buyer incentives and federal reserve board member 
martha seger warned that the auto and housing industry slumps could 
push the us economy into recession 
a check with the big three automakers monday found that most 
layoffs at 35 of the 54 assembly plants belonging to general motors 
corp ford and chrysler will be during the first two weeks of next 
month 
auto plants will be shut down next week for the usual christmas 
holiday but that will being extended at many of the plants 
gm said it was suspending production at 22 of its 30 car and 
truck assembly plants next month each for at least two weeks 
affecting about 75000 workers ford said it was closing 11 of its 
16 assembly plants for a week or two apiece affecting about 25400 
workers 
chrysler previously announced that two of its eight plants would 
be idled for twoweek periods in january involving 7300 workers 
that could change later in the week when the companys january 
production figures firm up spokesman doug nicoll said 
while some of the moves by the big three had been reported 
earlier the latest announcements gave a clearer indication of the 
size of the cutbacks 
its obviously symptomatic of current demand in the industry 
which is very low said auto analyst douglas laughlin of bear 
stearns amp co in new york 
while gm ford and chrysler carve deeply into their january 
production the five japanesebased automakers assembling vehicles 
in the united states plan normal production next month 
in fact honda motor co ltd said monday it was beginning 
production at its second car plant in the united states 
laughlin and other auto analysts have predicted for months that 
production levels in the first quarter of 1990 would be sharply 
curtailed during the second half of 1989 automakers continued 
ambitious production schedules despite waning demand 
inventories rose and companies started and stopped incentives to 
shrink the backlog as the 1990 model year officially started oct 
1 inventories began to shrink lately they have been swelling 
again 
wards automotive reports a weekly newsletter of the auto 
industry reported earlier this month that as of nov 30 dealers 
had an 88 sellingday supply of new cars on hand 
in other words if the current selling pace continued and no 
more cars were received from factories the supply wouldnt dry up 
for nearly three months 
recent 10day sales reports from dealers have found cars and 
trucks made by the big three selling at a pace far slower than 
during the corresponding periods a year ago early december car 
sales by dealers for the big three for instance were 297 percent 
lower than they were during the same time last year 
sales of trucks which have gained popularity in recent years 
were running 156 percent behind last years pace during the early 
december period 
if sales dont recover in the next month its going to be a 
much larger problem said analyst scott merlis of morgan stanley 
amp co of new york 
seger in mondays edition of the trade journal automotove news 
said the slumping auto and housing industries made a recession in 
the overall economy a real threat 
i think were very vulnerable and very much at risk seger 
said i have a growth forecast for next year that is just barely 
anything just enough so you can write it in black ink 
merlis said he expects the federal reserve board to take action 
soon to stimulate the economy because of the drop in car and truck 
sales during the fourth quarter 
the fed has got to come to the rescue of the auto industry 
he said 
meanwhile ford said monday it was offering up to 1000 on all 
1989 and 1990 aerostar minivans matching incentives announced last 
week by chrysler 
on friday chrysler for the first time began offering rebates on 
its popular minivans the dodge caravan plymouth voyager and 
chrysler town and country general motors corp hasnt said whether 
it will offer similar incentives for its minivans

the bush administration is telling regulators 
to begin selling real estate and other assets from failed savings 
and loans even before the government officially closes the 
institutions 
regulators should immediately begin shrinking such 
institutions balance sheets in a coordinated and orderly manner 
instructs a document obtained monday by the associated press 
the administration in a 91page strategic plan also is telling 
regulators to discourage influencepeddling by keeping a public log 
of all attempts by senior public officials or their staffs to 
influence their decisions 
the plan scheduled for release by the end of the year was 
prepared by the resolution trust corp oversight board an 
administration panel headed by treasury secretary nicholas f 
brady the board sets policy for the resolution trust corp a new 
entity run by the federal deposit insurance corp an independent 
regulatory agency 
under pressure from critics to increase the pace of its savings 
and loan bailout the administration plan outlines its approach to 
the huge task of selling more than 300 billion in sampl assets 
as of dec 8 the rtc had control of 280 failed sampls having 
disposed of 33 since its creation aug 9 it expects to get 
jurisdiction of at least another 220 insolvent thrifts in the next 
2 years 
most of the 33 sampl resolutions so far have involved transferring 
the deposits of the failed institution to a healthy bank or sampl 
leaving the government with the thrifts bad loans and repossessed 
real estate 
critics say unless the rtc starts selling sampl assets soon the 
properties will deteriorate driving up the taxpayer cost of the 
bailout 
earlier this month the shadow financial regulatory committee a 
group of university professors and other private analysts warned 
that if the rtc continued on its present course it could soon 
exhaust its available cash 
the oversight board is directing the rtc to develop a national 
program to sell sampl assets even before the institutions are closed 
or sold to new investors as part of that it suggested packaging 
and selling mortgage loans owned by the thrifts 
the plan also 
gives the rtc a june 30 deadline to finish reviewing the 
bailout deals put together by its predecessor the federal savings 
and loan insurance corp 
tells the agency to provide financing of real estate assets 
sparingly and only when necessary the financing should be 
considered a concession and be reflected in a higher purchase price 
for the property it said without such financing in effect a 
government loan some analysts contend the agency wont be able to 
sell many properties 
says failed sampls deteriorating at the fastest rate should be 
closed first but says the agency shouldnt waste time developing a 
precise priority schedule 
allows the rtc to sell a minorityowned thrift to another 
minority institution without opening the sale to nonminority 
bidders it permits the agency to finance the sale at market 
rates for as long as nine months in most cases the rtc is 
forbidden from keeping an interest in institutions it sells for 
longer than six months 
orders the agency to make public all documents spelling out the 
terms of bailout deals including the estimated cost to the 
government and the economic assumptions underlying the estimate 
despite its length the plan leaves a number of important issues 
unresolved for example it tells the rtc to develop a 
mechanism to raise additional funds to finance sampl bailouts until 
it can sell thrift assets however it gives the agency no guidance 
on the politically charged question of whether the additional funds 
should be added to the federal budget deficit 
it also gives the rtc wide latitude in deciding how to sell 
insolvent sampls including selling the whole institution with good 
and bad assets selling only the good assets and marketing the bad 
assets separately keeping all the assets for later sale and 
dismantling the thrift and selling it branch by branch

residents of the nations midsection may be 
cursing the frigid weather but some travel agents are praying for 
more to boost business during the peak christmas and new years 
season 
snow and cold is a godsend to travel agents said cliff 
stern president of windy city travel inc in chicago the phones 
ring off the hook 
airlines are helping the spurofthemoment travelers by lifting 
advancepurchase requirements on discount tickets 
but some industry observers said monday the breaks from airlines 
are a sign of a weak holiday travel season 
anytime you get a real sharp cold snap it often triggers 
vacation destination ticket sales said stephen dexter an 
airline industry analyst with kemper financial services inc in 
chicago 
what makes it abnormal this time around is the cold snap is 
happening during a holiday season and the tickets are still 
available that should not happen dexter said 
typically people who decide suddenly that they are going to 
escape the cold have to pay a pretty steep price there are still 
bargains out there for the lastminute guy 
strong bookings for january through march indicate people are 
postponing discretionary travel said susan storb general manager 
of the vacation division for rosenbluth travel agency inc in 
philadelphia 
i just think its just not as strong as its been over the 
past few years she said of the holiday season 
a number of airlines under pressure to increase fares because 
of recent cost increases said earlier this month that they were 
raising the prices on their popular deeply discounted fares 
commonly known as maxsavers 
but many airlines also announced they would waive the 14day 
advancepurchase requirement between dec 20 and jan 5 subject to 
seat availability 
there are restrictions no refunds are allowed and passengers 
must buy tickets within 24 hours of making a reservation and must 
stay over a saturday night 
but stern and dexter said airlines are adding discounted seats 
that can be purchased on short notice and are close to the cost of 
the maxsavers 
the record low temperatures are encouraging a trend toward 
shorter less planned vacations said greg declemente vice 
president for leisure travel at thomas cook travel in new york 
people are saying hey its 7 degrees in chicago lets get 
out of here for a few days declemente said 
temperatures monday morning were below zero in the upper plains 
in the teens in the rockies and in the 20s along the texas 
panhandle 
record low temperatures ranging from minus 3 degrees to minus 
10 degrees were recorded over the weekend in cleveland columbus 
ohio elkins wva paducah ky and indianapolis ind 
lastminute customers want to go anywhere thats warm and they 
dont seem to care where stern said 
theyll even settle for the sixties in florida as opposed to 
zero here 
in los angeles where people dont have to flee the balmy 
weather the travel business is holding its own for the holiday 
period said susan kaplan president of the southern california 
chapter of the american society of travel agents 
a general feeling that the economy is on a normal course may 
be contributing to a slight increase in travel bookings ms kaplan 
said 
things are not as rosy for some hotels in california 
fred gholi manager of the sunset plaza hotel in los angeles 
said he doesnt expect to be more than 70 percent full during the 
holidays 
compared with last year its terrible he said

manville corp says it will accelerate payment 
of a 50 million note to the asbestos victims trust fund created 
by its bankruptcy reorganization according to the manville 
personal injury settlement trust 
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission on 
monday the trust said it had been exploring ways to improve 
liquidity after a plan for manville to repurchase 500 million of 
its preferred stock fell through earlier this month 
one of those alternatives is an offer by manville to 
accelerate the payment of its 50 million trust note the sec 
filing said 
the note was to be repaid in two equal payments on sept 15 1990 
and the same date a year later 
the trust and manville have agreed in principle that manville 
will pay the 50 million principal amount of the note together with 
accumulated interest of approximately 8 million to the trust on or 
about dec 28 1989 the threepage filing with the sec said 
spokespersons for both denverbased manville and the washington 
dcbased trust confirmed that an agreement in principle had been 
reached 
manville and the trust anticipate that discussions will 
continue from time to time regarding mutually acceptable methods 
for improving the trusts financial flexibility and enhancing value 
for all shareholders the sec filing said 
in october manville a forest products and construction 
materials concern offered to purchase about 500 million of its 
preferred stock from the trust at market prices on dec 7 
however both the trust and manville announced that plan had been 
withdrawn because of a failure to agree on details of the agreement 
both manville and the trust said they anticipated future 
discussions regarding mutually acceptable methods for improving 
the trusts financial flexibility and enhancing value for all 
shareholders 
the trust was created as part of manvilles bankruptcy 
reorganization in the late 1980s after a wave of health claims over 
asbestosrelated diseases forced the company to seek protection 
from creditors under chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law 
the trust was created on nov 28 1988 the same day manville 
emerged from reorganization proceedings 
since then the trust has settled more than 15000 personal 
injury cases paying out more than 600 million to injured victims 
the trust owns 50 percent 24 million shares of manvilles new 
common stock as well as convertible preferred stock and a 18 
billion bond 
beginning in 1992 the trust will receive 20 percent of 
manvilles net profits under the terms of the agreement that 
created the trust

sears roebuck and co and cheryl tiegs are 
parting ways after 10 years but analysts say the split should 
cause no pain to the worlds largest retailer 
chicagobased sears also says it has loosened its marketing ties 
to walt disney co 
it has always been a mystery to me why retailers have been 
under the illusion that puting a celebritys name on a line 
enhances its value said analyst edward weller of montgomery 
securities inc in san francisco 
i think image over the course of years has become less 
important than substance he said 
thats exactly what sears is hoping as it continues its 
transformation from oldline retailer into a nationwide chain of 
stores featuring superstorelike power centers and everyday low 
pricing 
dropping the cheryl tiegs line of womens sportswear a private 
label carried by sears since 1980 reflects a commitment by the 
retailer to offer more namebrand goods said sears spokeswoman 
mary jean houde 
recent trends in womens apparel have indicated a preference 
for nationalbrand merchandise and less demand for celebrity 
lines she said monday 
ms houde said the decision to discontinue the relationship with 
ms tiegs was by mutual agreement 
in an interview with crains chicago business a local business 
weekly ms tiegs said sears was no longer interested in promoting 
the cheryl tiegs line 
when we started the program there was a lot of advertising 
enthusiasm and backing she said now theres no advertising 
support for female apparel its gotten lost in the shuffle 
but analyst walter loeb said sears was better off without ms 
tiegs 
i think she was a person for the 80s said loeb of morgan 
stanley amp co in new york sears is moving with the times 
sears also has apparel marketing agreements with actress 
stephanie powers tennis player yvonne goolagong and golfer arnold 
palmer 
the company announced earlier this year it was phasing out its 
mens dresswear department which includes a line of johnny 
carsonlabel clothes 
ms houde said sears affiliation with palmer and ms powers 
would continue at least until their contracts expire she said she 
did not know the status of sears affiliation with ms goolagong 
ms houde also said sears and disney had modified a 10year 
marketing agreement signed with much fanfare in 1987 the new pact 
sharply curtails sears rights to market disneycharacter products 
under the old agreement sears would have obtained exclusive 
rights to develop products using characters from rereleased and 
new disney animated films the deal also called for sears to 
sponsor a major attraction at the new mgmdisney theme park in 
orlando fla 
under the revised deal which was struck last february sears 
has rights to sell new disney merchandise on a casebycase basis 
and maintains exclusive rights until 1991 of about 250 characters 
from classic disney films and to certain disneythemed products 
sears has developed 
disney spokesman tom deegan said monday the old agreement was 
confining especially since disney has been rapidly expanding 
its own retail outlets in the past year 
deegan said there will be 41 disney stores carrying only 
disneycharacter merchandise by the end of this year with 100 
planned by 1992 
last march sears began a changeover to everyday low pricing a 
retailing strategy that includes more brand names lower prices and 
fewer temporary pricecutting sales 
the move was designed to fight discount chains and specialty 
superstores which have been steadily eroding sears market share 
but after an initial surge sears samestore sales growth has 
been sluggish

here is a list of car and truck final assembly plants that will 
stop production temporarily in january 
the location of the plant is followed by the approximate number 
of hourly employees and length of shutdown as provided monday by

inland steel industries inc has announced plans 
to sell a 13 percent stake to nippon steel corp of japan for 185 
million 
the proposed transaction was announced after the close of 
trading monday on the new york stock exchange and involves the sale 
of 185000 shares of a newly issued preferred stock for 1000 a 
share 
chicagobased inland will spend proceeds from the sale to buy 
back its common stock on the open market within a year said 
company spokesman sam saran 
inland also agreed to place a mutually acceptable designee of 
nippon steel on its board of directors nippon agreed it would not 
acquire additional inland shares for 10 years without inlands 
approval 
nippon paid 15 million for 1 percent of inlands common stock 
earlier this year and the new transaction would raise nippons 
stake to 14 percent 
the transaction will strengthen the companys longterm 
competitive position in the steel industry through an expanded 
strategic partnership with nippon steel inland chairman frank 
luerssen said in a statement 
in addition it will provide significant benefits to 
stockholders he said 
saran called the development another strategic move involving 
the close collaborative relationship between our two companies 
he said the announcement was not an antitakeover defense 
in a statement from tokyo nippon steel president hiroshi saito 
said with the growth of global manufacturing enterprises strong 
international relationships are increasingly important to assure 
our steel customers needs in north america 
in 1986 the two firms agreed to build a 400 million continuous 
coldrolling mill in new carlisle ind the mill which uses 
nippons technology for manufacturing sheet steel for the 
automotive industry is to begin operation next year

the electric cords that dangle from the 
fronts of cars on the northern plains are an oddity to strangers 
but a lifeline to residents 
the cords run to engine heaters that help cars start on brutally 
cold mornings folks on the plains have been known to call the 
devices inventor andrew freeman a saint 
i had a guy come up to me in a store the other day and thank 
me for inventing the heater the 80yearold freeman said monday 
he said he never would have gotten his car started that day 
without it i get a kick out of things like that 
strangers to the region point to the heater cords showing 
through the grillwork and ask whether they belong to electric cars 
but mark ewens a national weather service forecaster in fargo 
said the heaters have become necessary equipment in north dakota 
and other midwestern states 
we all have them we all use them ewens said when the 
air temperature is 33 degrees below zero when you get off work at 7 
am theres no way youd get the car started if you didnt have 
it plugged in 
freeman a north dakota native who lives in grand forks created 
his first heater out of necessity he got a patent on the device in 
1947 
tired of being unable to start his car in the winter he devised 
a heater that consisted of a brass cylinder about the size of a 
finger it contained a heating element attached to the end of a 
bolt 
the bolt replaced one of the headbolts in the engine and the 
cylinder with the heating element extended into the engine water 
jacket a cord attached to the top of the bolt plugged into an 
electrical outlet 
as cars changed freeman invented two other heaters a frost 
plug heater that attached to the side of the engine and an external 
tank heater 
drivers who want to make certain their cars start simply can go 
to a service station and have an engine heater installed for 
roughly 50 its cord is plugged into an outlet at night and the 
car is warm and ready to go in the morning 
freemans invention should get plenty of use in the coming days 
the temperature is not expected to climb above zero for the rest of 
the week 
ewens said decembers cold weather is not that unusual 
i think people have really poor meterological memories he 
said monday weve just had a few years of really mild winters 
now were back to normal 
and despite the cold freeman gets a warm twinge of pride when 
he sees all those cars with heater cords 
you walk around town and you see a lot of cars with plugs 
hanging out of them and you realize youre the guy who got that 
started

after rising 13 percent a month earlier the government reported 
today

at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 136 million units last 
month down from a revised 143 million units in october 
the october increase was the largest since december 1986 starts 
had fallen 49 percent in september 
the report was fresh evidence of the sluggishness in the housing 
industry construction has been one of the economic sectors slowed 
by high interest rates resulting from the federal reserves grip on 
credit as it strives to curtail inflation 
in addition to its effect on construction jobs and the building 
materials industries the housing industry has an impact on other 
related industries such as home appliances and furnishings 
interest rates ranged from 982 percent to 974 percent in 
november according to surveys by the federal home loan mortgage 
corp total housing starts during the first 11 months of the year 
were down 65 percent from the same period of 1988

percent to an annual rate of 102 million units singlefamily 
starts had risen 55 percent in october

units after rising 148 percent in october starts in the west also 
fell down 53 percent to 375000 units 
starts increased 37 percent to 305000 units in the midwest and

nissan motor co expects exports to rise 02 
percent next year but overseas production to increase by 7 percent 
officials of japans second biggest automaker said tuesday 
exports are expected to reach 107 million vehicles with 
overseas production totaling 683000 vehicles nissan managing 
director kiyofumi morimoto told a news conference 
domestic production is likely to rise 3 percent to 244 million 
vehicles while domestic sales will increase 4 percent to 137 
million morimoto said 
he said nissans increased output will not contribute to trade 
friction with the united states or other trading partners because 
there will be a gradual shift to production overseas at the expense 
of domestic production 
by 1992 he said nissan expects overseas production to rise to 
1 million cars and trucks and domestic production to stand at some 
25 million vehicles including 1 million exports making half of 
all nissans sold overseas manufactured in japan 
projected domestic sales by 1992 of 15 million vehicles are in 
line with nissans effort to capture 30 percent of japans domestic 
market morimoto said 
currently nissans market share is 238 percent but the 
automaker hopes to gain 1 percentage point a year for the next 
several years he said 
nissan also will consolidate its operations in north america 
from next year under a new umbrella company morimoto said 
nissan north america inc will oversee research and development 
sales finance and other operations in the us market and 
coordinate the activities of nissans 10 us subsidiaries 
the establishment of nna in the united states will give nissan 
a tripolar corporate management structure with integrated 
operations headquarters in japan north america and europe 
nissan president yutaka kume said in a statement we decided to 
establish nna in order to promote the growth of our us operations 
as truly american firms 
the authority to make decisions will be gradually transferred 
from tokyo to this company morimoto said they will have more 
and more responsibility for making decisions for our business 
activities in the united states such as model lineups and 
marketing 
capitalized at 2 million and based in los angeles nissan north 
america will be established jan 1 with 30 staff members and grow 
to some 100 in a few years morimoto said 
the firms president will be yoshikazu hanawa currently a 
nissan managing director and chairman of nissan motor corp usa 
morimoto said 
the automaker considered naming an american to head its us 
operations but decided on hanawa because the main job is 
coordinating nissan subsidiaries the central player is obviously 
going to be nissan tokyo morimoto said one who is most versed 
in this is a japanese who is the best choice for this company 
he said he expected an american would eventually take over the 
job although he did not say when

consumer prices rose a moderate 04 percent in 
november as higher food and heating costs more than offset cheaper 
gasoline the government said today 
the seasonally adjusted increase in the labor departments 
consumer price index which translated into an annual inflation 
rate of 49 percent followed a brisk 05 percent rise in october 
and relatively modest hikes from june through september 
the price spurt was slightly higher than many analysts had been 
expecting the government blamed the rise on a jump in natural gas 
and electricity costs and an increase in prices at supermarket 
checkout counters for beef eggs fresh vegetables and dairy 
products 
through the first 11 months of this year consumer prices have 
risen at an annual rate of 46 percent up only slightly from the 
44 percent price gains in both 1988 and 1987 
however the yeartodate figure masks a rollercoaster ride 
that saw prices rising at a 67 percent annual rate for the first 
five months of the year moderating through the summer and then 
returning to about average for the past two months 
the november inflation number a notch above the 03 percent 
rise anticipated by many analysts dampened hopes in financial 
markets that the federal reserve board would lower interest rates 
this week the dow jones average of 30 industrials slipped 150 to 
269603 in the first half hour of trading 
meanwhile the labor department said in a separate report that 
americans average weekly earnings after adjusting for inflation 
fell 07 percent last month following a 06 percent rise in october 
in another economic report the commerce department said housing 
starts fell 47 percent in november reversing a 13 percent jump a 
month earlier new homes and apartments were built at a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 136 million units last month down from a 
revised 143 million units in october 
leading the november advance in consumer inflation was a 06 
percent boost in food prices the steepest since may dairy 
products jumped 17 percent the third consecutive sharp increase 
the price of fruits and vegetables soared 18 percent the second 
big gain in a row 
economists are attributing the dairy price hikes to last years 
drought which caused many farmers to slaughter milk cows 
gasoline prices fell 21 percent in november following a 09 
percent rise in october however other forms of energy were more 
expensive the index for natural gas and electricity rose 15 
percent while fuel oil edged up 02 percent following a big 25 
percent gain a month earlier 
overall energy prices fell 01 percent last month prices 
excluding the volatile food and energy sectors a measure 
considered a better gauge of underlying inflationary pressures 
were up 04 percent following a 05 percent gain in october 
the cost of medical care which has been increasing at an 85 
percent rate over the past year was up 08 percent in november in 
line with previous increases 
clothing costs edged up 01 percent in november following two 
months of steep increases that coincided with the introduction of 
fall lines 
in other areas newcar prices rose 08 percent tobacco was 
down 01 percent and entertainment costs climbed 02 percent 
before taking into account normal seasonal changes the consumer 
price index stood at 1259 in november that meant that a 
hypothetical selection of goods and services costing 100 in the 
198284 base period would have cost 12590 last month up from 
12030 a year ago 
the bush administration is predicting an improvement in consumer 
inflation next year to the 41 percent range not far below the 
projections of most economists 
however private analysts generally dont share the 
administrations optimistic belief that inflation will continue to 
decline in 1991 and beyond they predict the federal reserve board 
which influences economic growth by its control of interest rates 
and the money supply wont engineer the sustained period of 
sluggishness necessary to flatten wage increases 
analysts attribute the most recent spate of dampened price 
activity in part to the central banks yearlong campaign ended 
last spring of pushing interest rates higher since then the fed 
has sought to avoid a recession by allowing rates to decline 
we dont think the fed really has the strength of will to 
reach its zero inflation goal said cynthia latta an economist 
with drimcgraw hill a lexington mass forecasting firm 
the 54 percent unemployment rate in november she said matched 
the rate at the start of the year and was not appreciably above the 
15year low of 5 percent reached in march 
services are 55 percent of the consumer index and i 
dont think theres been very much easing in the labor market 
she said the pressure is still toward larger wage increases 
last week the labor department said its index for wholesale 
prices which does not include services declined by 01 percent in 
november

united technologies corp vying for more 
than 100 million in jetengine orders from thailands national 
airline has donated 500000 to a charity run by the thai royal 
family a newspaper reported today 
utc officials called the donation to typhoon victims 
humanitarian and said they often give money to victims of natural 
disasters but some industry experts said the contribution appeared 
to be an attempt to curry favor with a potentially big customer 
the hartford courant reported in a copyright story 
they didnt give that out of the goodness of their heart 
said retired navy rear adm gene r larocque director of the 
center for defense information a washington watchdog group 
thai officials in washington said utcs contribution to the 
typhoon relief fund was the largest they were aware of 
the contribution was given to thailands ambassador to the 
united states during a private ceremony dec 5 at his washington 
residence us and thai government officials and an aide to utc 
consultant alexander m haig jr confirmed monday 
haig former us secretary of state and a former utc president 
approved utcs contribution to victims of typhoon gay in his role 
as head of the corporations pacific advisory committee 
the typhoon ravaged southern thailand in november killing 
nearly 500 people and leaving thousands homeless 
sales to thailand of utc products ranging from pratt amp whitney 
engines and sikorsky helicopters to otis elevators have grown 
sevenfold in the past five years to 691 million in 1988 
last summer thai airways international canceled a 65 million 
engine supplier fairfieldbased general electric co and switched 
the order to pratt amp whitney the order was for engines on three 
airbus a300 widebodied jets 
pratt and ge are now competing for as much as 120 million in 
thai airways engine orders expected to be announced early next 
year those engines would power at least six a300s and one boeing 
747 being added to the airlines fleet 
utc spokesman dan harrison said monday there were no conditions 
attached to his companys donation 
thailand is an important country to us harrison said but 
the contribution was made for humanitarian reasons 
harrision said utc officials felt the amount of money was 
appropriate given the magnitude of the typhoon he said the 
giant aerospace and industrial concern also contributed to relief 
efforts for victims of hurricane hugo and the earthquakes in san 
francisco and armenia but he said he didnt know how much it gave 
the us goverment donated 75000 to the typhoon victims the 
thai embassy said ge did not contribute spokesman dwight weber 
said 
utc wanted to keep its donation quiet and didnt want any 
publicity said promjit boonlang an information officer at the 
thai embassy 
franklin j parisi utc vice president for communications said 
the corporation makes donations all the time that we dont 
announce 
larocque said the contribution while legal has an 
unpleasant malodorus smell to it 
industry analysts said utcs contribution reflects its 
recognition of the way business is done in many foreign countries 
business is done any way you can do it in asia any way you 
can get it done said mark a bobbi an analyst with forecast 
international in newtown conn

the nations car market is so suffused with 
lookalike brands and models that competition increasingly will be 
forced into pricing says a professor who has studied the market 
for three decades 
he forecasts competitive pricing over the next few years like 
weve never seen before with potentially severe damage to 
products lines and even to entire manufacturing operations 
therell be a shakeout says professor eugene jennings of 
michigan state university an adviser to top corporate executives 
and an observer of the automotive industry whose opinions are 
widely sought 
we go into the 1990s with homogenization of design and style 
clear across the board said jennings who earlier attributed 
some of general motors lost market share to a lack of 
distinctiveness among its own brands 
now he says sameness pervades the whole industry to such an 
extent that product differences are even too subtle for 
advertising being observable only after salesmen call attention to 
them in the showroom 
but getting buyers into the showrooms particularly for cars 
with little curb appeal is more difficult than ever jennings 
says especially after two years in which sales were kept strong by 
drawing from future markets 
he says it is unlikely that any one manufacturer intended it 
this way but that they reacted in similar conservative ways to a 
fear of overcapacity in the industry rather than risk losing share 
through unacceptable innovations 
the consequences were too great if they guessed wrong said 
jennings in an interview new concepts would have presented too 
much risk and yet he suggested it might take the assumption of 
such risk to make a breakthrough 
the rare market situation already is reflected in advertising 
where he says more and more money is spent simply to break 
through the clutter and confusion and images and themes 
substitute for product distinctiveness 
its almost as if automobiles have become a commodity said 
jennings a business professor and author of many books about the 
inner workings of corporations 
the pricing problem could hardly be more serious he says 
observing that prices are following the same conservative trend 
a bit above or below the category average and be prepared to 
make a deal 
while the sameness syndrome exists he says it will be 
difficult for many car lines to sustain premium prices since 
customers can easily switch to the same car made by a different 
manufacturer 
planning and development also are affected by the syndrome big 
spending in this area always has been risky if necessary since a 
new concept or radical style change might not be accepted 
the failure of fords edsel is a monument to that risk and more 
recently says jennings photographs of general motors saturn car 
a costly effort to rethink the entire production process were 
greeted by yawns 
in the current market where sales already have been 
borrowed from model years to come and with large overcapacity 
in manufacturing operations the risk is magnified no one can 
afford to have an edsel says jennings 
while assumption of that risk might eventually be the only way 
to dissolve the stalemate jennings feels for the time being 
companies most likely will fight their battle on the pricing front 
prices will not hold at premium levels he states

wealthy property developer donald trump bought the shuttle service 
from miamibased eastern for 365 million in early june

association one of three unions that struck eastern last march 
forcing it to seek bankruptcy court reorganization the eastern 
pilots and flight attendants halted their strikes shortly before

with just a few days left before christmas at 
least one toy manufacturers thoughts have turned from sales to 
safety 
peter reynolds president of milwaukee toymaker brio usa is 
taking advantage of the season to amplify his call for stronger 
regulation in the 125 billionayear toy industry 
reynolds whose company is best known for its wooden train sets 
wants the consumer product safety commission to shift from 
voluntary to mandatory safety standards 
the toy industry as a whole has a pretty good record 
reynolds said in an interview but obviously one death or one 
injury is too many to me the big problem with safety is that the 
law does not require any manufacturer to test any toy 
he said the commissions voluntary standards allow too many 
hazards to slip through its safety net 
but others in the industry including several charged with the 
duty of ensuring toy safety say reynolds concerns are overblown 
david miller president of toy manufacturers of america said 
the voluntary standards the industry uses are some of the most 
comprehensive in the world 
were usually complaining that were overregulated and that 
they mettle too much in how we do our business miller said 
in 1988 the commission logged 142000 toyrelated injuries for 
children of all ages between january 1988 and september 1989 it 
received reports of 34 toyrelated deaths spokeswoman anne pavlich 
said 
most large manufacturers including brio whose parent company 
is based in sweden already test their toys for safety the vast 
majority of injuries and deaths are caused by the toys of smaller 
companies and imports reynolds claimed 
the major manufacturers would probably question my sanity in 
doing this he said what im doing is im voicing an opinion 
and hopefully someone will hear it 
ms pavlich said the commission receives complaints both for too 
much interference and not enough regulation 
were damned if we do damned if we dont she said there 
are people telling us that they want us to do more and others 
telling us that were doing too much 
the commissions activities include monitoring injuries and 
deaths through reports from hospital emergency rooms and other 
sources recalling hazardous toys through reports from its 
investigators consumers and the manufacturers themselves and 
working with the us customs service to prevent imports of illegal 
toys she said 
the commission and millers association work together with the 
philadelphiabased american society for testing and materials to 
develop the voluntary safety standards for toys 
astm is a 90yearold organization with 32000 members who 
represent manufacturers consumers and other interests said 
patricia downey public relations manager the members make up 135 
committees that develop standards she said 
the important thing about our standards is that theyre not 
mandatory ms downey said the main premise is that there be a 
balance between the producer and the user 
the commission is represented on the consumer products committee 
to make sure the testing standards for toys meet the consumers 
needs ms pavlich said 
if the commission were to decide that the requirements were 
insufficient it could establish mandatory requirements she said 
miller said his association which represents manufacturers 
accounting for 90 percent of us toy sales works with the society 
and regularly reviews testing requirements 
miller said those voluntary requirements and the commissions 
other efforts are enough to keep the market safe 
i find it amusing to be defending them but the people who are 
picking on them know very little about toy safety miller said 
toy experts also agree that much of toy safety depends on 
parents who must buy the right toys for their children and make 
sure theyre used properly 
reynolds said parents often ignore age labels and by doing that 
put their children in danger 
if it says for 3 years old and up and you give it to a 
10monthold it could be potentially dangerous he said

american numbers crunchers are the latest 
capitalists to exploit the budding ussoviet business romance 
ernst amp young a leading us accounting and professional 
services company said tuesday it had signed an agreement with 
vneshconsult the soviet management consulting firm creating what 
was described as the first westernsoviet accounting company based 
in moscow 
the american partners will provide training in their worldwide 
audit methodology for vneshaudits soviet personnel ernst amp young 
said in a news release 
there is no public accounting profession in the soviet union 
since there has been until recently no need for one said james 
searing ernst amp youngs director for international business 
services 
concepts such as the western understanding of profit 
measurement and the differences between external and internal 
auditing and reporting are new for them searing said setting 
up business there requires far more than just adapting one 
countrys accounting standards to anothers 
ray groves cochief executive of ernst amp young said the firms 
entry into the soviet market is both a tangible symbol of the new 
cooperation and a highly practical advance movement for american 
commerce 
a number of highly visible american companies have been signing 
business deals and exploring opportunities in the soviet union 
because of the liberalization encouraged by president mikhail 
gorbachev who is trying to revitalize his nations stagnant 
economy and reduce the states role 
us ventures now range from importing soviet watches to 
building the worlds largest mcdonalds restaurant in moscow 
ernst amp young one of the largest accounting firms in the world 
was established by the merger of arthur young and ernst amp whinney 
earlier this year the company has offices in more than 100 
countries

it wasnt quite lindbergh but a texas university 
professor earned his footnote in aviation history tuesday when he 
completed the first transatlantic flight in an ethanolfueled 
airplane 
max shauck a mathematics instructor at baylor university in 
waco texas landed at the small toussuslenoble airport southwest 
of paris after a onehour flight from tours 
he set out with italian copilot grazia zanin from waco on sept 
15 in a light experimental aircraft that carried them through often 
rough weather to canada the azores portugal spain and finally 
france 
we feel we have proved that ethanol is a very reliable fuel 
shauck said you cant get across the atlantic on an unreliable 
fuel 
proving the merits of the relatively cheap nonpolluting 
ethanol compared to standard fuel drove shauck make the journey 
which he funded himself at more cost than i care to think about 
ethanol is essentially an alcohol fuel made from vegetable 
matter usually corn in the united states and sugar beets in 
europe shauck who also does air pollution research at baylor 
says ethanol retails for about 120 per gallon in the united 
states compared to 180 for highoctane aviation fuel 
it produces more power it burns cooler and theres a lot less 
pollution he said but we had to go out of our way sometimes 
to find it 
indeed shauck and zanins flight log includes a hodgepodge of 
small stopovers in north america chosen chiefly because ethanol 
could be delivered there 
these included paducah ky newark ohio hazelton pa and 
suffolk ny the plane also stopped at shaucks hometown of 
mansfield ohio 
in canada they stopped at moncton and st pierreetmiquelon 
before lifting off from st johns newfoundland on oct 20 for 
flores in the azore islands a 2000mile crossing made terrifying 
by rain and thunderstorms 
its a long way over a lot of water when youre flying a 
little plane looking for little islands he said we didnt 
have sophisticated navigation equipment 
they waited in the azores for nearly three weeks for a shipment 
of ethanol to arrive before flying to lisbon nov 10 shauck 54 
and ms zanin 33 made stops in bilbao spain and bordeaux 
rochetsuryon and tours in france 
technically they became the first people to cross the atlantic 
in an ethanolfueled plane the minute they touched down in 
portugal but the original plan they filed with american 
authorities was from suffolk county ny airport to paris 
the fiberglass aircraft a sort of flying wing built by the 
velocity corp of sebastian fla featured elevators normally 
found on the tail at the front of the airplane and a propellor 
mounted on the back 
the whole contraption weighs about 2100 pounds and can reach a 
top speed of 200 mph 
shauck resists comparison with american aviator charles 
lindbergh first man to cross the atlantic in a flight from new 
york to le bourget airport in paris on may 31 1927 
he is a hero shauck said everything now is different 
than it was in his day i avoided going to le bourget because i 
didnt want to be compared to him 
shauck said he would take a commercial flight back to texas but 
that the aircraft will make one more trip to ms zanins 
hometown trieste

miller brewing co will add a new medium this 
week to its effort to teach consumers to drink responsibly when the 
beermaker begins a 2 million television advertising campaign for 
the holidays 
the company has used the slogan think when you drink as a 
tag line in its print advertisements and in taverns and liquor 
stores but this years campaign will be the first time miller has 
used the slogan in a television campaign spokeswoman elizabeth 
conlisk said 
we looked for a long time for the right tone and the right 
message ms conlisk said when we did it we wanted to do it 
right 
the television commercials were to start thursday and run 
through dec 31 and will have a warm and cozy feeling to them 
ms conlisk said 
rather than focusing on the problems irresponsible drinking can 
cause the commercials feature traditional american taverns 
taverns are places where people have gone for years to have 
and beer and be with their friends ms conlisk said these 
commercials make people feel good about that 
the commercials include the message 
the next time its miller time for you wed like to ask you 
to do one very simple thing be responsible think when you drink 
milwaukeebased miller the no 2 us brewer has sponsored 
educational programs since 1984 based on what ms conlisk called 
the companys belief that education is the way to reduce alcohol 
abuse 
in the past miller has been criticized by antidrinking 
activists who claim the brewer has taken an inconsistent and 
irresponsible approach toward selling its product 
in march for example miller was rebuked for running 
advertisements in college newspapers advertising supplements 
intending to capitalize on the rollicking atmosphere of spring 
vacation miller later withdrew and apologized for the ads which 
featured tips for men on how to scam babes at the beach 
in june thenus surgeon general c everett koop issued a set 
of proposals that would ban alcohol advertisements on college 
campuses and outlaw ads using celebrities who appeal to youths 
beer industry officials complained koops effort amounted to an 
antialcohol campaign they said while koops proposal went too 
far the industry as a whole was moving toward empashizing more 
responsible drinking in an effort to discourage drunken driving 
on new years eve miller and its distributors will sponsor free 
bus and taxi rides and designateddriver programs in many us 
cities to promote responsible drinking and safe driving ms 
conlisk said 
this is really a concerted effort nationwide to reinforce the 
moderation theme she said 
anheuserbusch of st louis millers top competitor will use 
the budweiser clydesdales in the brewers longrunning know when

mobil oil corp is trying to keep under 
wraps court documents that a former executive wants to use as proof 
to show the oil giant fired him for refusing to conspire in a 
coverup of environmental problems 
mobil argues that most of the documents are irrelevant to valcar 
bowman jrs case and says it is happy to release portions 
mostly sentences and paragraphs of the papers that it considers 
central to his claims 
the nations secondlargest oil company behind exxon corp 
denying it has anything to hide also argues that the reports are 
selfcriticisms encouraged by environmental regulators and that 
revealing them would discourage industry attempts to be candid 
about environmental conditions 
us district judge harold a ackerman scheduled a hearing for 4 
pm wednesday to decide whether the documents should be kept 
secret 
on dec 11 ackerman dealt the company a setback in the case 
ruling that enough evidence existed for a trial to take place on 
bowmans claims 
bowman says he was wrongfully fired in april 1986 from his job 
as manager for environmental affairs at mobil chemical cos 
princeton nj office 
he lost his job bowman says because he refused to sanitize 
environmental assessment reports about conditions at plants in the 
chemical division the changes were suggested by company lawyers 
bowman was told to submit the reports to company lawyers after 
he refused to cooperate with what he charged was an attempt to foil 
investigators from examining environmental records at mobils 
bakersfield calif chemical plant 
the company ordered him to remove records following a raid at a 
torrance calif plant bowman alleged 
mobil denies wrongdoing calling bowmans claims a 
gardenvariety wrongful firing lawsuit the company said it had 
a right to terminate bowman and did so as part of an economic 
cutback mobil also denies seeking to mask environmental problems 
and accused bowman of releasing secret company documents to 
competitors 
mobil also says changes in the environmental reports were minor 
matters of wording and typographical errors 
the focus of wednesdays hearing is expected to be 20 or so 
assessment reports some filed by each side 
they are the heart of the case said bowmans attorney 
stephen b wiley the reports are all directly relevant to the 
proceeding and should be available to the public he said its 
a public proceeding 
wiley said mobil was seeking to exclude the public from 
wednesdays hearing but mobil attorney richard reibstein denied 
that 
the reason were protecting the privacy of these reports is so 
we can continue to do them said mobil chemicals general 
counsel ron neill the whole objective here is in the public 
interest if companies felt their selfcriticisms could ever be 
splashed across newspapers they would be discouraged from making 
such evaluations he said

struggling us automakers are likely to announce 
more assembly plant layoffs in coming days adding to the 107000 
workers who will be idled in january and causing a domino effect in 
the industrys supply chain 
sources at chrysler corp and general motors corp speaking on 
condition of anonymity said tuesday that more temporary assembly 
plant shutdowns probably will be announced later this week ford 
motor co said monday that 11 of its 16 assembly plants would be 
down for at least a week each next month 
the layoffs coupled with slumping sales and scant prospects of 
quick relief mean theres a recession in the auto industry some 
analysts have said 
in all the big three say 35 of their 54 us assembly plants 
will halt production for at least a week each in january affecting 
more than 107000 employees that comes amid predictions of 
continued weak sales in early 1990 
maybe there really is a recession if youre talking about gm 
ford and chrysler said analyst kathleen heaney of nikko 
securities co international inc of new york 
however she said the whole industry is suffering a less severe 
sales slump than the big three japanese cars whether made in the 
united states in transplants or in japan are enjoying healthy 
sales she said 
but the recent sales slump and impending layoffs among the big 
three automakers which make nearly twothirds of the cars and 
trucks sold in the united states paint a darker picture 
theres no question that the fourthquarter experience has 
been one of doom and gloom said analyst scott merlis of morgan 
stanley amp co of new york he like others expected the big 
threes slumping sales to continue into the first half of the year 
ford vice chairman harold poling said tuesday that if the 
federal reserve board takes steps to stimulate the economy as many 
economists believe it will fords plant shutdowns could be held to 
the 11 announced monday 
i would think that the actions we have taken will get our 
inventories in line said poling who will become ford chairman 
in march when donald petersen retires and if we see some action 
on the part of the fed to reduce interest rates then i think that 
those actions might be enough 
in the event that we dont see the actions taken then it 
may not its just very difficult to predict that 
its also difficult to predict the domino effect of closing an 
assembly plant mainly because of the adoption of the 
justintime manufacturing system in this strategy parts 
arriving at an assembly spend little if any time in a warehouse 
going instead directly from the truck or train to the assembly line 
the system cuts costs and lets manufacturers keep tighter 
controls on quality by spotting a problem in a component before 
taking delivery of a large number of them 
assembly plants which can employ 1500 to 4000 people apiece 
receive components from a variety of suppliers some owned by the 
manufacturers and others that are independent 
those suppliers may have different policies about their own 
production schedules when an assembly plant stops making vehicles 
if the supplier is an outside company it may have other 
customers for its products or an inhouse retail system which 
maintains a market for its products even when the assembly plant 
closes 
for instance if a manufacturer announces that a car plant will 
be shut down for a week a steelmaker works right up to the time 
that the assembly plant stops 
the steel company then has several options which ranging from 
building its own inventory to selling to other customers to halting 
production and laying off workers 
this makes it difficult to estimate how many layoffs in the 
supply industry may stem directly from assembly plant closings 
sheldon wesson a spokesman for the american iron and steel 
institute in washington said automakers are steel companies 
biggest customers 
what tends to happen here in the relationship between steel 
and automotive he said is as soon as the automotive industry 
sneezes steel reaches for a handkerchief

the dollar finished slightly higher tuesday 
against most major currencies but slipped against the japanese yen 
in quiet global foreign exchange dealings 
gold prices were narrowly mixed republic national bank of new 
york quoted a bid for gold as of 4 pm est of 41175 a troy 
ounce down 1 from mondays late bid earlier gold gained on new 
yorks commodity exchange and in europe 
currency analysts said the pace of trading has slowed in recent 
days as the yearend holidays approach and traders try to protect 
whatever gains they may have made for the year 
we are in a holiday trading period and a lot of bank traders 
are not as active as they had been said james merrill senior 
international economist for the financial services company 
mccarthy crisanti amp maffei 
he said the currency markets appeared to be largely unaffected 
by new government reports of a decline in housing starts and a 
slightly biggerthanexpected rise in consumer prices last month 
the 47 percent decline in housing starts indicated some 
sluggishness in the economy weakness that many analysts feel the 
federal reserve will eventually respond to by lowering interest 
rates 
but the 04 percent rise in consumer prices was slightly 
stronger than analysts had expected and could delay the feds 
credit relaxation 
dollar traders were also wary about making big commitments until 
they get some indication from the twoday meeting of federal 
reserve policymakers on what course they have charted for monetary 
policy over the next few weeks 
if the fed moves to lower interest rates the dollar could be 
hurt since falling interest rates cut the returns foreigners get on 
dollardenominated investments 
the dollars decline against the yen was attributed to 
speculation that the bank of japan may soon raise its key lending 
rate japanese authorities denied the rumors of an imminent rate 
hike but speculation persisted that an increase would eventually 
be necessary to shore up the yen 
in tokyo the dollar fell 042 japanese yen to close at 14380 
yen later in london the dollar was quoted at 14380 yen the 
dollar fell to 14365 yen in new york from 143725 yen late monday

michael r quinlan president and chief executive 
of mcdonalds corp will succeed fred l turner as chairman of the 
worlds largest restaurant chain on march 31 the company announced 
tuesday 
quinlan 45 said in an interview that he wants to put the 
golden arches in china and that mcdonalds customers will likely 
see more dinnertype entrees added to the menu in coming years 
the challenge to mcdonalds is to be more things to more 
people the same philosophy weve been following for many years 
now quinlan said 
turner 56 will become senior chairman and continue as chairman 
of the boards executive committee mcdonalds said in a statement 
the post of senior chairman was previously held by company 
founder ray kroc from 1977 when turner succeeded kroc as chairman 
until krocs death in 1984 
quinlan joined mcdonalds in 1963 as a parttime mailroom 
employee he served as a mcdonalds restaurant manager field 
service manager district and regional manager before being named a 
vice president in 1974 
he rose quickly through the executive ranks and was named in 
1980 to the newly created position of president of mcdonalds 
usa in charge of domestic operations quinlan was named 
president and chief operating officer of the corporation in 1982 
and became chief executive officer in 1987 
quinlan will continue as ceo after assuming the chairmanship but 
the position of corporate president will be eliminated 
industry analysts said quinlan has been largely in charge of 
operations since the mid80s while turner has been more involved in 
strategic decisions 
among quinlans goals are further expansion of mcdonalds into 
eastern europe the company has restaurants in yugoslavia and 
hungary and plans to open one in moscow on jan 31 
the company also hopes to put a restaurant in beijing quinlan 
said 
weve made some preliminary inquiries were studying the 
infrastructure and were searching for a partner over there he 
said were bullish on it 
the fastfood giant based in the chicago suburb of oak brook 
has 11000 restaurants in more than 50 countries international 
business accounts for about 30 percent of mcdonalds earnings 
which totaled 646 million last year 
analysts see foreign expansion and successful implementation of 
an eatin dinner menu as two keys to continued growth at 
mcdonalds since the markets for fastfood breakfast lunch and 
takeout food are crowded with competitors 
mcdonalds has been testmarketing pizza and fried chicken and 
the company reportedly is considering low lighting music and 
plattertype dinners for suppertime customers 
quinlan will head a relatively youthful senior management team 
which also includes ed rensi 45 president of mcdonalds usa 
and jim cantalupo 46 president of the companys international 
operations

orange juice futures prices up sharply tuesday while harsh winter 
weather in the north spurred the heatingoil market to greater

cents higher on the new york cotton exchange with the contract for 
delivery in january at 13245 a pound orange juice futures 
normally are limited to daily moves of 5 cents but the limit on the 
january contract has been lifted pending the contracts upcoming 
expiration 
the runup reflected predictions for freezing temperatures 
saturday and sunday night in the florida citrus region the result 
of an intensifying cold air mass that shattered records in the 
northern plains on tuesday and was working its way east and south 
the severity and timing of the cold wave are reminiscent of a 
deep freeze that badly damaged the flordia orange crop six years 
ago said celeste georkakis an analyst in new york with cargill 
investor services inc 
nevertheless she said being that weather forecasters have 
been predicting freezes all along the growers will be better 
prepared than in 1983 when the freeze came on christmas eve 
a hard freeze forecast for the citrus country last week failed 
to materialize freezing temperatures touched only the northernmost 
edge of the citrus groves 
heatingoil for nearterm delivery rose on the new york 
mercantile exchange for the third straight day and the 14th time in 
the last 15 sessions still supported by strong weatherdriven 
demand for increasingly tight supplies 
crudeoil futures finished mixed after a day of erratic price 
swings linked to the expiration of the january contract which went 
off the board 11 cents higher at 2233 a barrel gasoline and 
deferred deliveries of heating oil finished lower 
an american petroleum institute report released after the close 
showed a 17millionbarrel reduction in us stocks of petroleum 
distillates last week while inventories of crude oil rose 41 
million barrels and gasoline stocks rose by 36 million barrels 
west texas intermediate crude oil futures settled 15 cents lower 
to 11 cents higher with february at 2128 a barrel heating oil

of trade on indications that china had bid for 410000 metric tons 
of us wheat at subsidized prices corn closed mixed and soybean

employees have been living with uncertainty at 
trans world ailines inc ever since carl icahn bought the carrier 
in 1986 but now they believe the handwriting on the wall is 
becoming clearer 
twa which began the decade as one of the nations largest 
airlines is in serious danger of disappearing in the early 1990s 
industry analysts and workers say 
the airline is saddled with 27 billion in debt its 218 
airplanes are among the oldest used by major carriers and pilots 
mechanics and flight attendants are frustrated and disillusioned 
about their future 
on monday twa announced plans to sell its chicagotolondon 
route and four gates and a dormant maintenance facility at 
chicagos ohare airport to american airlines for 195 million a 
move that shocked and angered workers 
the sale is subject to regulatory approval 
its very difficult to see how selling a route to a competitor 
can be beneficial said herb johnson president of the machinists 
unions local 1650 in kansas city selling the london route just 
doesnt compute 
johnson who heads the airlines largest union local said 
workers cant help but wonder if theyre going to have a carrier to 
work for in 1990 and its particularly upsetting to see the route 
go to a fierce rival like american 
american is a tough competitor everyone knows that once they 
get in your markets theyll blow your doors off johnson said 
market share is everything in this business and when you start 
reducing that youre in trouble 
icahn said the proposed sale will help restore profitability at 
twa which has already lost 117 million for the first nine months 
of 1989 and is expected to lose between 230 million to 300 
million for the year 
twa is headquartered in mt kisco ny but has one of its 
largest hub operations in st louis 
icahn who took the company private last year said the company 
will need the money from the sale to make it through a slump in 
business thats already under way and to survive an industry 
consolidation in the mid90s 
there is a time to invest and a time to be cautious and now 
is the time to be cautious icahn told employees in threepage 
letter on the state of twa 
but no one at twa or in the airline industry seems to believe 
that caution is what prompted the sale to american 
some analysts believe icahn is trying to raise more money to buy 
additional stock in usx corp a company hes been rumored to be 
interested in buying for years 
in fact on tuesday icahn received permission from the federal 
trade commission to acquire a bigger stake at least 25 percent 
of usx a pittsburghbased steel and energy company 
icahn currently owns 34 million or 136 percent of usxs 
outstanding common shares 
theres also speculation that icahn has found an airline that 
wants to buy twa and icahn is now trying to streamline the airline 
to help avoid any antitrust violations 
this sale could be consistent with a lot of different theories 
about whats goig to happen to twa said paul turk an analyst 
with avmark inc an aviation consulting firm based in arlington 
va 
kent scott chairman of the twa unit of the air line pilots 
association said he believes mondays proposed sale is the 
beginning of the complete liquidation of the airline 
i think hes testing the water of opposition in the regulatory 
agencies and if he gets this one through he can use it as a 
precedent when he proposes others said scott who is based in 
st louis 
the next routes for sale may be the coasttocoast flights new 
york to los angeles and san francisco scott said meanwhile 
scott said he expects the three boeing 747 airliners used by twa to 
fly from chicago to london to be up for sale once the american deal 
goes through 
the pilots union will encourage federal regulators to quash the 
deal scott said 
whatever the reason for mondays proposed sale analysts agree 
with icahn that the airline industry has been struggling recently 
with higher costs and slackening demand for air travel 
twa hasnt been performing well and the whole industry hasnt 
been doing too well either said mark daugherty a stock analyst 
at dean witter reynolds in new york this mondays sale 
surgically removes a route that wasnt that important but its 
hard to say what it means

campeau corp struggling under a 
multibilliondollar debt says it hopes to reassure lenders who 
finance shipments to its department stores that the companys 
longterm fiscal health is sound 
we respect the obligations of those with whom we do business 
to make financial decisions that they deem to be in their own best 
interests we remain hopeful that we will be able to resolve this 
situation favorably well in advance of spring merchandise 
deliveries carol sanger campeaus vice president of corporate 
communications in cincinnati 
federated department stores inc and allied stores corp owned 
by the torontobased campeau revealed last week that they are 
trying to restructure 7 billion in debt and may need to seek us 
bankruptcy court protection from creditors while reorganizing their 
finances campeau corp assumed more than 8 billion in debt when 
it bought cincinnatibased federated in may 1988 
officials of cit groupfactoring the new york retail lending 
company and subsidiary of manufacturers hanover corp expressed 
concern about the retailers statements that they could run out of 
cash by the end of january endangering payments due suppliers in 
february and beyond 
until the people who sit in the ivory tower in toronto make 
some decisions and let people know whats going on we are 
reserving a decision about future shipments francis x basile 
president and chief executive said monday hopefully they will 
do something positive to allow us to continue to support their 
companies 
last week heller financial a major lender in chicago cut off 
credit on shipments to campeau stores after the retailers 
disclosure last wednesday 
the moves could halt early delivery of spring merchandise to 
federated and allied store divisions including the 
cincinnatibased lazarus burdines of miami and bloomingdales of 
new york it is not known how many clients represented by heller 
and cit still plan to ship spring merchandise to the stores 
cit and heller are factoring companies those that extend 
credit to retailers and collect suppliers bills from retailers 
and have significant influence in the apparel industry factoring 
companies buy manufacturers products and assume the risks that 
those bills will be paid by retailers 
without credit from a factoring company suppliers assume full 
risk for payment on their shipments 
federated and allied told the securities and exchange commission 
that store revenues and loans will give them enough cash until 
midmarch but money could run out by late january if suppliers 
demand quicker payment on bills and lenders cut off money 
officials said 
january 10 is the magical date basile said payments for 
merchandise shipments are made on the 10th day of a month 
basile said campeaus disclosure leads him to conclude the 
company can meet payments due jan 10 but that payments due feb 
10 could be in danger if the company runs out of cash

the cold spell that put parts of the country in 
a deep freeze continued to make heating oil a hot commodity 
tuesday but traders said the frenzied price rally has slowed as 
many dealers decided to cash in on the recent runup 
clearly it ran up just a little too far and a little too 
fast said john hill a vice president for merrill lynch energy 
futures some of the buying we saw was panic buying 
yes its cold and theres some tightness in supply but 
were not running out of heating oil 
on the new york mercantile exchange the january contract for 
no 2 home heating oil rose 035 cent to 7501 cents a gallon 
after soaring more than 7 cents in the last two trading sessions 
traders said profittaking kept the price from rising even 
higher and the feeling that the current cold temperatures and 
inclement weather wont last too much longer helped push down the 
prices of contracts for february march and april 
still the current wholesale price is now at the highest level 
since the winter of 198586 according to hill 
meanwhile the january contract for west texas intermediate the 
leading grade of us crude oil was up 11 cents to settle at 
2233 per 42gallon barrel 
the contract had jumped 112 on monday to an eightmonth high 
but traders attributed that sharp increase largely to the fact that 
the contract was set to expire on tuesday 
january unleaded gasoline lost 058 cent to close at 5393 cents 
a gallon after gaining 171 cents on monday 
some traders attributed that drop to internal market influences

bolstered by easterns cutbacks in miami where it is the no 1 
carrier 
in its presentation to creditors in new york on monday eastern 
disclosed the planned dehubbing of miami because it has been 
a source of heavy losses creditors were told easterns planned 
sale of latin american routes to american would enable eastern to 
refocus on atlanta as the airlines major hub 
the sale of the routes and certain other assets to american for 
471 million was confirmed late tuesday in an announcement from 
american 
easterns revised business plan is quite similar to its 
original rebuilding plan devised last april as the carrier tried 
to recover from a crippling strike eastern in august decided to 
keep its latin routes but recently resumed negotiations with 
american because of concerns about a cash shortfall 
company spokesman robin matell declined to elaborate on the 
future of the miami and atlanta operations 
eastern officials in the past said there were no plans to move 
easterns corporate headquarters from miami to atlanta but 
wouldnt speculate on whether that was a possibility later 
eastern has 260 departures from atlanta where it is second to 
delta airlines it had 285 departures from atlanta before the 
strike eastern spokespeople said no projections were available 
tuesday on the total flights planned for atlanta 
before the march 4 strike eastern operated about 10 percent of 
its daily schedule of 1040 flights out of miami eastern officials 
had said recently that sale of the latin routes could leave as few 
as 24 miami departures daily 
eastern building back while in chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization is back to 76 daily departures from miami 
peter reavely chief of aviation development at miami 
international airport said he expects new yorkbased pan am to 
become the airports major carrier between miami and the northeast 
and texasbased american would dominate between miami and sun belt 
destinations 
the effect is positive for us pan am spokeswoman pamela 
hanlon said of easterns plans one of the primary reasons for 
building up miami was to fill the void left by easterns diminished 
operations what they are saying regarding the dehubbing 
supports the decision we made earlier 
pan am has boosted its daily miami departures to 70 from 48 one 
year ago 
american has 36 departures from miami is expanding its american 
eagle commuter service there and has made miami the headquarters 
for its new floridacaribbeanlatin services division 
we see miami as a very important part of the american system 
particularly feeding traffic from the caribbean american 
spokesman ed stewart said

american airlines inc which became the no 1 
domestic carrier this year is taking advantage of sales by 
competitors and expected industry weakness next year to push its 
international expansion and become more than an american airline 
the moves are necessary analysts say if american is to become 
a player internationally it currently has 5 percent of the 
european market 
fast and furious dealmaking could also have the pleasant side 
effect of making parent amr corp less attractive to a corporate 
raider by decreasing cash and depressing earnings 
we have developed at american airlines a very wideranging 
growth plan that we have been pursuing for five years that is long 
range in nature and will carry us into the next century said 
company spokesman al becker 
one piece of it is international expansion that includes 
europe the pacific rim and eventually latin america american 
also has talked to aeroflot about gaining entrance to the soviet 
union becker said 
these are good longterm moves and if they affect earnings in 
the short term they can deal with that said analyst mark 
daugherty at dean witter reynolds in new york 
american based in fort worth took the latin american plunge in 
one move tuesday saying it would pay eastern airlines 471 million 
for its 20 central and south american routes plus the rights to 
some other european cities and some domestic facilities 
just monday american announced a 195 million deal with trans 
world airlines inc for its chicagolondon route plus four gates 
and a maintenance hangar at chicago ohare international airport 
also a bankruptcy court judge approved americans 400000 purchase 
of braniff landing rights at chicago and new york 
by the middle of next year american will have about 165 flights 
weekly to 18 european cities six years ago it flew to none 
american has been expanding vigorously this year spending 
billions on new airplanes to fly its newly acquired or 
soughtafter routes beginning work on a 400 million maintenance 
facility to service the jets expanding its operations at domestic 
hubs and fighting off billionaire donald trump aided in large 
degree by the collapse of another airline buyout 
this year alone american has begun service to stockholm 
sweden lyon france brussels belgium hamburg dusseldorf and 
stuttgart west germany and zurich switzerland in addition next 
year american will add service to barcelona spain helsinki 
finland warsaw poland and glasgow scotland 
in the pacific american next year will begin flying to sydney 
australia and auckland new zealand also independent of any deal 
with eastern american has announced increased service to 
monterrey cancun and cozumel mexico 
the airline also is trying to add a second tokyo flight and is 
investigating flights to seoul korea taipei taiwan hong kong 
singapore and manila 
additionally american is considering expanding service in 
canada which it does not consider among its international 
destinations 
the growth has been financed through record profits although 
chairman robert crandall has warned the performance wont continue 
this quarter or next year 
but the company has plenty of cash and an appetite for spending 
theres a good deal of expansion we still want to do in 
europe becker said our basic feeling is that some of the 
opportunities that are out there may not be as readily available in 
1992 when many interior european trade barriers fall 
part of our strategy is to build as much of our route system 
before 1992 as we can he said because of fears outsiders will 
have difficulty competing in a unified european market 
american had no international service in 1982 after jettisoning 
unprofitable pacific service in the mid70s an old subsidiary 
american overseas airways was sold to pan american in the early 
50s 
american is not endangering its financial health through the 
expansion the analysts said 
theyre not going out and buying assets willy nilly said 
edward starkman at painewebber its one of the bestrun 
companies in this industry 
but analyst helane becker of shearson lehman hutton sounded a 
warning note 
i really think that you dont necessarily want to take 500 
million or 200 million cash and give it to a competitor that would 
be out of business in a year she said referring to eastern and 
twa you sort of have to wonder if they could buy these assets 
out of bankruptcy at a cheaper price than theyre doing today

boeing co faced a new labor threat tuesday from 
the engineers and scientists who play a crucial role in designing 
its planes less than a month after a crippling machinists strike 
ended at the aerospace giant 
in ballots counted monday night those members of the seattle 
professional engineering employees association voted 69 percent to 
reject a threeyear contract offer from the worlds largest 
commercial airline builder 
although members also voted by 52 percent not to authorize their 
negotiators to call a strike the union said it might be well into 
1990 before the contract talks resume 
our executive director has been in touch with the director of 
labor relations at boeing and weve made known our availability at 
any time said dan mahoney union general counsel 
however it appears the rejection was quite a surprise to 
company negotiators and they werent prepared for it so they have 
to assemble their negotiating team 
company negotiators apparently had made commitments to other 
activities and face a logistical problem in getting them all back 
together mahoney said 
right now if i had to guess it would be after the first of 
the year before negotiations will resume mahoney said 
boeing officials were meeting to discuss the situation but 
there was no indication when talks might resume company spokesman 
paul binder said 
the engineering unions other unit which represents boeing 
technical and support workers ratified a separate threeyear pact 
by nearly 2 to 1 both contracts expired dec 1 
the offer rejected by engineers who now make an average of 
nearly 40000 a year included a 3 percent wage increase a 
productivity bonus of 10 percent of gross pay in the first year and 
no further general increases 
technicians with average pay of about 28000 accepted wage 
increases of up to 3 percent and bonuses of up to 10 percent 
mahoney said the union was sending a survey to its engineer 
members so when we do go to the table well know what to ask 
for 
he added however that the engineers feel the money offer 
undervalued their services i do believe they company negotiators 
will have to offer more money 
members of the international association of machinists and 
aerospace workers voted nov 18 to end a 48day strike and accept a 
threeyear pact

american airlines announced its anticipated deal 
with eastern airlines tuesday saying it would buy latin american 
routes and certain other assets from easterns parent company for 
471 million 
the deal with texas air corp in one stroke makes american a 
major international carrier giving it 20 destinations in 15 
central and south american countries 
in addition to the latin american routes american also gets a 
miamitolondon route from easterns sister carrier continental 
airlines and easterns routes to toronto from miami and tampa 
fla and its unused route authority from miami to madrid spain 
plus american gets continental and eastern slots at john f 
kennedy international airport in new york and eastern slots at new 
yorks laguardia airport miami international airport washington 
national airport ohare international airport in chicago and san 
juan puerto rico 
american and continental also agreed to a gate exchange at 
dallasfort worth international airport 
the deal had been rumored to be imminent for more than a week as 
eastern seeks cash to help it emerge from bankruptcy protection 
the bankruptcy court and government regulators have to approve the 
sale which is a key part of easterns reorganization plan 
separately eastern said it will sell the 14 lockheed l1011 
aircraft currently used to serve the latin american routes 
american which has spent billions of dollars on new jets recently 
said it wasnt interested in the l1011s they range in age from 
125 years to 17 years 
besides the routes and landing slots texas air agreed to drop a 
1 billion lawsuit against sabre american parent amr corps 
computer reservations systems texas air subsidiary continental 
airlines claimed sabre which is used by travel agents to book 
passengers and is the largest such us system unfairly favored 
american flights 
although deal between american and eastern had been expected 
negotiations broke down in august apparently over the disposition 
of the lawsuit 
analyst helane becker at shearson lehman hutton inc said 
american would have a leg up on european carriers trying to serve 
the growing latin american market because american could route 
flights from europe through its miami hub cutting three hours off 
the trip 
this transaction will allow our company to continue building 
our international network and it will make the us a strong 
competitor in central and south america by linking that region to 
americans extensive route system chairman robert l crandall 
said in a press release 
american called a news conference for miami wednesday morning to 
discuss the deal which it said will create about 2000 airport and 
reservation jobs in that city during the next five years 
texas air said eastern would realize 349 million from the sale 
while continental 1025 million and system one texas airs 
reservation system 195 million for the telecommunications 
equipment needed to service the routes 
the sale of these assets will enable eastern airlines to 
continue on its course of successfully rebuilding as a smaller and 
stronger airline from the future with its operation at its atlanta 
hub texas air said in a prepared statement 
eastern and continental will continue to operate the routes 
until american is ready to take them over texas air said

the battle over pennzoil cos purchase of 
21 billion worth of chevron corp stock moved into murky legal 
waters tuesday with a pennzoil lawyer asking a federal judge to 
lift restrictions on suing the rival oil giant but denying any 
intention to sue 
people have a right to be in court stephen bomse a lawyer 
for houstonbased pennzoil said at a hearing on chevrons request 
for a longlasting order protecting it from suits by pennzoil 
without court permission he said the order would tie our hands 
while bomse insisted pennzoil had no plans to sue chevron over 
its antitakeover maneuvers chevron lawyer william edlund said 
pennzoil has a history of hostile nonpassive investments and 
added chevron suspects the motives of pennzoil 
us district judge thelton henderson said he would rule within 
a few days and meanwhile left another judges order in place that 
requires pennzoil to obtain the courts permission before suing san 
franciscobased chevron in any court over issues related to the 
case 
chevron the nations fourthlargest oil company sued pennzoil 
the 14thlargest on dec 7 after learning that pennzoil bought 88 
percent of chevrons common stock 
pennzoil said it was making a longterm investment for tax 
purposes to shelter the bulk of a 3 billion settlement it 
received from texaco and had no intention of acquiring control 
chevron challenged those statements citing pennzoils past 
attempts at oil company acquisitions and accused pennzoil of 
concealing its purpose of a takeover or forced restructuring in 
violation of federal securities law 
the suit seeks to force pennzoil to sell the stock and prohibit 
more purchases without court approval 
at the same time chevron beefed up its defenses against 
takeovers giving its directors a veto over purchases of stock 
purchases of more than 10 percent and arranging a 5 billion line 
of credit five groups of stockholders none affiliated with 
pennzoil have sued chevron management over those moves 
pennzoil says the suit is based on unfounded speculation and has 
moved to dismiss the case henderson who will hear that motion 
friday has already ruled that the allegations in the suit are 
serious enough to give chevron access to pennzoil documents and 
executives orders chevron says pennzoil has largely resisted so 
far 
when it filed the suit chevron obtained a temporary restraining 
order from chief us district judge william ingram prohibiting any 
related suits by pennzoil without approval of the local court 
chevron sought an injunction tuesday that would leave the 
prohibition in place until the court disposed of the case 
chevron believes that pennzoil will be litigating edlund 
chevrons lawyer told henderson saying such suits were common in 
takeover attempts 
he said extending the restrictions would avoid multiple suits 
and should not harm pennzoil if it is telling the truth about its 
intentions 
but bomse said chevron had failed to show any threat of harm 
that would entitle it to an injunction 
you cant grant an injunction based on speculation merely 
because chevron may believe that pennzoil is going to commence 
litigation pennzoils lawyer said

the 19 european community and seven 
european free trade association nations agreed tuesday to begin 
talks early next year on closer economic cooperation aimed at 
forging a socalled european economic space 
the idea is to allow free movement of trade capital people and 
services between the two trade blocs said officials at a meeting 
here of the ec and efta foreign ministers 
the 12 ec nations are to remove their internal borders by late 
1992 this project has sparked fears among the seven efta nations 
that the single market will occur at the expense of trade with them 
jon baldvin hannibalsson the foreign minister of iceland which 
currently holds the efta presidency said he was immensely 
satisfied with the outcome of tuesdays meeting 
he said the efta nations austria iceland finland norway 
sweden switzerland and liechtenstein hoped the talks could start 
in early 1990 and be concluded by the end of the year 
but ec external relations commissioner frans andriessen was more 
cautious saying the talks must end before dec 31 1992 the date 
by which the ec is to complete its singlemarket project 
the ecs twoway trade with efta 217 billion is only slightly 
less than its combined twoway trade with the united states and 
japan which amounts to 230 billion 
andriessen said the ministers singled out problems to be solved 
in the negotiations for closer economic ties between efta and the 
ec the most important is the institutional aspect of the new 
ecefta relationship 
he said each side should respect the autonomy of its own 
decisionmaking and that this was not negotiable for the ec at 
best he said he could see a kind of osmosis between the two 
blocs decisionmaking institutions 
hannibalsson said each bloc would continue to monitor compliance 
with its own laws after the two sides have expanded their economic 
cooperation creating what officials term a european economic 
space 
the foreign ministers also agreed to widen cooperation among the 
19 nations in such areas as research and development the 
environment education working conditions and social welfare 
consumer protection programs for small and mediumsized 
enterprises and tourism 
some cooperation in these areas has already begun the 1990 
european year of tourism for example is a joint ecefta effort 
separately the ec and efta nations signed an agreement under 
which they will exchange information on compulsory technical 
regulations this accord takes effect july 1 1990 and is designed 
to prevent obstacles to trade arising from differences in national 
technical standards 
the ministers also signed an agreement to allow universities and 
industries in efta and ec nations to develop partnerships exchange 
students and staff and take part in joint training projects this 
agreement comes into force jan 1

the european community will unveil on 
wednesday a proposal to reduce but not eliminate farm subsidies 
over a period of five years 
the plan officials said tuesday represents the ec position in 
crucial talks to reform agricultural trade in the current round of 
talks within the general agreement on tariffs and trade the 
genevabased world trade body 
the ec position was approved late monday at a meeting of the 12 
ec foreign ministers it contrasts with that of the united states 
which wants to eventually eliminate all farm subsidies 
with this proposal the ec is taking the initiative in the farm 
negotiations an ec commission source said 
in it the ec maintains its opposition to a longterm 
elimination of subsidies calling instead for a progressive 
reduction in support over five years with a review of the 
situation at the end of that period 
under a us plan presented to gatt existing agricultural 
subsidies would be converted into more visible tariffs that 
gradually would be reduced 
the ec came slightly closer to the us proposal by recommending 
a partial conversion of the trade curbs into fixed tariffs but it 
has said cuts in some price supports should be rebalanced by 
raising others 
the us opposes this arguing it cannot accept any increases in 
trade barriers 
a controversial element of the ec proposal is the suggestion 
that countries receive a credit for subsidy cuts made since 
1986 when the current uruguay round of gatt talks began 
the ec says it has built up large credits through changes it has 
made in its farm support program over the last three years 
the ec seeks a global approach with all tradedistorting 
subsidies from export refunds to price guarantees covered in 
the negotiations it wants an international agreement on a common 
measure of support that would be the basis for subsidy cuts by all 
gatt parties 
for its part the united states has been looking for commitments 
on individual support measures
