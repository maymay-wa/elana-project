democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis hopes his flagging campaign gets a boost from his 
appearance on nightline tonight that goes beyond the television 
programs viewers 
dukakis trailing republican george bush in the polls with just 
two weeks until election day seems to have everything to gain from 
his appearance on the 90minute edition of the abc news program 
the interview by host ted koppel will be conducted facetoface 
a format the massachusetts governor insisted on 
for the governor its more natural than staring into a camera 
lens dukakis spokeswoman elizabeth bartle said 
although koppel has interviewed some subjects in person before 
his guests are usually in a separate studio listening to the host 
through an earphone and at times viewing koppel on a monitor 
dukakis campaign officials say this session will be conducted 
with the two men sitting side by side in an 11th floor suite in the 
hyatt regency tech center in denver where the candidate will have 
been campaigning 
the governor agreed earlier this month to appear on 
nightline after abc invited dukakis and bush to appear together 
on the program bush turned the offer down saying that two debates 
between the two candidates were sufficient and that he would be 
too busy campaigning 
the nightline interview comes during a spurt of dukakis 
television appearances in recent days he appeared on abcs good 
morning america and cbss this morning last friday was on 
cnns larry king live monday night with his wife kitty in an 
interview taped sunday and mrs dukakis appeared sunday on cbss 
face the nation 
its an opportunity for the governor to speak directly to as 
many american citizens as he can reach ms bartle said 
dukakis and his aides are banking on the candidate handling 
himself well with koppel one of televisions most respected 
interviewers and on news of his performance reaching more than the 
late night shows 7 million viewers 
hell get an opportunity to dominate the network news not only 
tuesday night but wednesday when he should be able to control the 
sound bites said michael j robinson an associate professor of 
government at georgetown university who has studied the 
relationships between the press and politicians 
with the live interview being broadcast at 1130 pm edt a 
large portion of the viewers staying up to watch will be 
politically active or involved people and very few of them will be 
those undecided voters dukakis needs to win over robinson said 
yet even among the politically involved there will be a value to 
dukakis appearance 
hell persuade people who follow him that its not over 
robinson said hell make an impassioned appeal to his own 
supporters to really work the next two weeks 
penn kimball professor emeritus in journalism at columbia 
universitys graduate school of journalism agrees with robinsons 
evaluation 
kimball said nightline is a fantastic wordofmouth 
program that people seem to talk about the next day 
its the bounce off the program that counts kimball said 
its what the media says happened in the koppel interview that 
will be in all the papers and the evening programs those bounces 
are the ones that will reach the broader audience 
bush campaign spokesman mark goodin said there was no chance 
that the vice president would change his mind and appear on the 
program 
weve done nightline already he said 
bush appeared on the program on a live hookup from houston 
after he won the gop presidential nomination when dukakis agreed 
to appear on the show shortly afterward he sought a facetoface 
interview but was turned down the programs producers felt it 
would be fairer to conduct the questioning the same way bush had 
done it said nightline spokeswoman laura wessner 
the networks invitations to appear on tonights show made it 
clear that the format for the interview was negotiable wessner 
said

altering images is the tack both slade 
gorton and mike lowry are following in their quest for the us 
senate with the former republican senator hoping to revive his 
political career and the democratic congressman looking to move up 
to a sixyear job 
lowry a fiveterm representative has calmed his bombastic 
rhetoric and trademark armflailing shaven his yasser arafatstyle 
beard pressed his usually rumpled suits and sworn off beer for the 
campaign 
gorton has been apologetic about his failure to listen and a 
number of his earlier senate votes and is warming an icy detached 
image that he blames in large part for his loss to democrat brock 
adams two years ago 
that defeat also stems from gortons infamous vote swap in may 
1986 the white house agreed to nominate liberal democrat william 
l dwyer a gorton recommendation to the federal bench only 
after gorton then a freshman senator agreed to provide the last 
vote needed to confirm conservative lawyer daniel manion as a 
federal appeals judge 
for all the style changes the liberal democrat and 
moderatetoconservative republican remain neckandneck in 
washingtons first senate race in 44 years without an incumbent 
republican sen dan evans surprised the political establishment 
when he decided to step down after serving the remaining five years 
of the late sen henry m scoop jacksons term 
polls conducted earlier this month found gorton holding a slight 
lead over lowry but based on the margin of error in the surveys 
the contest is a dead heat 
yet on issues ranging from defense and taxation to the war on 
drugs and abortion the candidates remain far apart 
lowry wants to cut military spending especially on defense 
systems such as star wars and the mx missile and use the money for 
education health transportation public works and housing 
gorton a former air force officer insists the nation is more 
secure because of the military buildup over the last eight years 
and warns that we shouldnt abandon any deterrent system before 
gaining concessions in arms talks with the soviets 
gorton favors construction of a navy homeport for the us 
nimitz carrier task force at everett on puget sound lowry calls it 
an environmentally hazardous home pork 
when the house passed a controversial antidrug law to impose 
the death penalty on drug murderers and slap heavy fines on users 
lowry was one of only 30 votes against it he opposed a number of 
the bills provisos as unconstitutional 
gorton cited lowrys vote as another sign he is out of step with 
the state of washington where drugs and gangs emigrating north 
from california have become more common 
gorton says no to federal tax hikes lowry has not ruled them 
out 
the senate hopefuls both are fighting to be seen as the 
candidate of the broad middle of the electorate particularly the 
reagan democrats and independents who will swing the election 
lowry says his progressive brand of politics fits 
democraticleaning washington gorton says his own more 
conservative approach is in the mainstream and that lowry is a 
liberal maverick whos out of step 
this diversity has failed to move either candidate into a clear 
lead with the nov 8 election looming 
mike lowry is a tough competitor no question about that 
concedes gorton he has done a good job of moderating his image 
from the way he presents himself in congress to the middle of the 
road out here 
i am an awful lot closer to the views of the vast majority of 
people i am in fact both in philosophy and in voting record a 
moderate conservative that is what the vast majority of the people 
feel comfortable with mike is a dedicated and articulate liberal 
in congress 
lowry disagrees with gortons assessment of the voters if not 
lowrys record 
we have an excellent chance of winning because the people of 
the state of washington agree with us on the issues he said 
when you compare slades record in six years in the senate and my 
10 in the house the choice is clear

the club of rome best known for its first report 
warning of the dangers unlimited growth pose to the planet is 
bringing together thinkers and world leaders this week to celebrate 
its 20th anniversary 
and in addition to fostering discussion on what it calls a new 
global society the club plans internal changes that will for the 
first time seek to turn its ideas into action 
club members come from 51 countries rich and poor capitalist 
socialist and communist 
i think we are at a turning point in the life of the club 
after 20 years secretarygeneral bertrand schneider said in an 
interview in his paris office 
the club of rome which despite its name has been based in 
paris since 1984 was founded by italian industrialist aurelio 
peccei and scottish scientist alexander king in 1968 as a sort of 
floating international think tank 
the club committed itself to approaching issues from a global 
perspective with a sense that problems like pollution 
overpopulation hunger or the impact of developing technologies are 
interdependent 
governments and international organizations are stuck in the 
daytoday management of problems they usually have no time for 
longterm thinking we have a special mission we have no 
responsibility to anybody except ourselves schneider said 
at this weeks conference such international figures as prince 
sadruddin aga khan former president belisario betancur of 
colombia crown prince hassan of jordan and international monetary 
fund director michel camdessus are meeting to discuss reasons to 
live and to hope in a new global society 
a highlight will be a session friday night at the sorbonne 
intended to be an exchange between the clubs luminaries and youth 
of the world 
in a world that has become so young we need their help to 
understand the world schneider said its important for us 
and for them to exchange our experiences 
the clubs first report limits to growth was the spark for 
a worldwide reassessment of the environmental economic and social 
dangers of untrammeled expansion 
published as a book the report has sold 10 million copies in 27 
languages 
it provoked a very passionate debate all around the world and 
its not finished schneider said the idea of zero growth has 
been falsely attributed to the club of rome some industrialists 
did not like the idea at all of course 
the clubs commitment to act as well as talk is about to have 
its first major test in a development project scheduled to start 
next year in eight countries of the droughtprone sahel in africa 
the project will coordinate un forces local government and 
aid organizations to promote development and reclaim land from the 
spreading desert 
schneider said the club is to be the catalyst rather than 
the planner or organizer of the project 
the peaceful un force is to assure logistics of stopping the 
desertification and starting development building camps and 
greenhouses digging wells planting trees ensuring communications 
and transport he said 
it is intended to last at least five years but the hope is to 
make rapid progress in order that the population can see the 
immediate improvement in their daily lives 
in its private sessions this week the club intends to overhaul 
its organization establishing a collective presidency increasing 
its visibility and setting up a budget for the first time 
we started by saying that we were a nonorganization now we 
all accept the fact that we are a small modest organization but 
an organization schneider said 
we think that in a world which is very often blocked by 
ideologies bureaucracies and economic shortterm interests we 
offer the flexibility the informality and the possibility for very 
quick decision and intervention which may be useful for the whole 
world community

sen dan quayle is accusing the democrats 
of trying to polarize the electorate and predicts that presidential 
nominee michael dukakis will grasp at any straw in the final 
two weeks of the campaign 
we cant take anything for ganted the vice presidential 
nominee said in exhorting a louisville riverboat audience to work 
hard for the gop ticket headed by quayles running mate george 
bush 
later at a rally in lexington quayle outlasted a sizable group 
of produkakis demonstrators who disrupted his indoor rally with 
repeated chanting 
what they dont want to hear is the truth an unruffled 
quayle said as the demonstrators waved dukakis signs and placards 
linking bush to panamanian ruler manuel antonio noriega 
quayle was campaigning today in lexington before traveling to 
stone mountain and augusta ga and later florida both southern 
states are considered likely wins for bush but quayle is making 
the trip to help gop candidates in particular senate contender 
connie mack iii of florida 
on monday at the riverboat fundraising event on the ohio 
river quayle talked about the intensity and negativism heading 
into the home stretch of the campaign 
boy is it getting nasty out there theyll grasp at any 
straw theyre going to try and polarize the american electorate 
theyll say anything that comes to their mind whether its true or 
not he said 
later quayles rowdy indoor rally was disrupted by a loud group 
of dukakis supporters chanting no more lies and 
bushnoriega 
quayle interrupted his remarks to respond to the protesters 
gesturing in their direction he said if i had to support 
michael dukakis id yell too i would shout and scream and yell 
because he aint gonna make it 
the demonstrators however continued chanting nearly drowning 
out the candidate in the outer corridor of rupp arena 
but quayle prevailed proceeding to attack dukakis to the 
delight of the bushquayle supporters who burst into chants of 
good night mike 
earlier monday quayle branded it a diversionary tactic for 
former democratic candidate jesse jackson and quayles vice 
presidential opponent sen lloyd bentsen of texas to accuse the 
bush campaign of racists appeals 
its totally absurd i think it shows just how desperate they 
really are to start fanning the fires of racism in this country 
quayle told reporters aboard his campaign plane en route to 
missouri 
jackson alleged the bush campaign was sending a racial signal by 
hammering dukakis over the case of convicted murderer willie 
horton jr horton a black man on a weekend furlough from a 
massachusetts prison brutalized a maryland couple 
in missouri quayle used a stop at east central college in union 
to toss a baseball around and take a shot at dukakis 
reporters noted after quayle hit a couple of grounders that 
dukakis also likes to play baseball now and then on the campaign 
trail and asked quayle how he thought he would do against the 
massachusetts governor 
quayle laughed and said i never served with michael dukakis 
and i dont know him but hes no baseball player 
the remark was a paraphrase of a bentsen putdown of quayle when 
the republican compared himself with president john kennedy during 
the vice presidential debate

tens of thousands of european homes 
have high radon levels but officials say many people question the 
danger in spite of research linking the colorless odorless gas to 
fatal lung cancer 
some researchers feel the continent may be years behind the 
united states in developing programs to meet the threat 
we were two years behind the united states in recognizing the 
problem and it will take another two to three years to catch up 
said bernd franke of the west german institute for energy and 
environmental research in heidelberg 
a traditional popular belief that the gas has curative powers 
compounds the problem a few radon spas still operate in austria 
and hungary and people still descend into deep caves in hopes the 
gas will help cure rheumatism and other ailments 
radon is a radioactive gas produced in the decay of uranium of 
which at least trace amounts are present in all soil and rock 
it tends to concentrate on the lower floors of buildings and 
kills by leaving its a residue in the lungs that irradiates the 
tissues for a lifetime smoking substantially increases the danger 
from radon according to health officials 
us health officials say radon exposure is second only to 
smoking as a cause of lung cancer and up to 20000 americans die of 
its effects each year legislation pending in congress would 
require inspections of public schools and set a longterm goal of 
making air equally low in radon indoors and outdoors 
american officials have declared 4 picocuries of radon per liter 
of air 150 becquerel per cubic meter to be the level at which 
homeowners should take preventive action that is the equivalent of 
smoking 10 cigarettes a day or having 200300 chest xrays a year 
west germany recently set radon action limits at 250 becquerel 
per cubic meter the equivalent of 66 picocuries the limit for 
new houses in sweden is 75 becquerel or 2 picocuries 
extensive testing and research programs are under way in 
britain west germany sweden norway and switzerland 
its going to take a long time to pin down the houses at 
risk said matthew gaines of the national radiological protection 
board in britain well be testing until the end of the century 
recent european studies have found 
more than 20000 british homes have high radon levels and 
800900 people die annually as a result of exposure to it the 
radiological protection board is testing a sample 17000 homes 
most of them in devon and cornwall where the problem is most 
serious 
in sweden about 40000 homes have unsafe levels of radon and 
roughly 60000 houses are tested each year more than 700 deaths a 
year are attributed to the gas and officials say the rate could 
reach 1100 in the early 1990s 
up to 190000 homes in west germany have radon levels above 
government safety standards and about 2000 radonrelated deaths 
occur annually initial tests show the highest levels in the south 
and southwest 
homes in volcanic areas of the upper lazio region north of 
rome had italys highest radon concentrations 
most homes in denmark holland belgium spain and greece 
showed little radon risk to residents 
french officials have said radon is not a serious health risk in 
that country and some have discounted publicity about the gas in 
the united states and elsewhere 
its a question thats been a bit blown up in the media 
said jeanpierre moroni of the government radiation control agency 
theres a very simple measure open a window when you get up 
its a matter of good sense it amounts to not living all closed 
up 
french environmental activists disagree 
to say there is no problem in france is a mistake said 
corinne castanier who speaks for the independent regional 
commission for information on radioactivity 
she said her group established after the chernobyl nuclear 
accident in 1986 has found high levels in some homes in the 
mountainous massif central region 
officials in britain and west germany say they have trouble 
convincing residents of the danger 
i think a lot of the reaction is a bit skeptical said 
albert weeks chief building control inspector for the kerrier 
district council in cornwall southwest england 
its almost a nonbelief they dont really think its that 
bad they say weve been living with it for x number of years and 
it doesnt seem to affect us weeks said 
sweden where 10 percent of the land area contains highrisk 
levels of radon has led the way in testing and helping homeowners 
reduce their risk of radon exposure 
a new law provides financial help for homeowners who make 
radonreducing improvements the government also has begun a study 
of 4500 people to gain more information on the relationship 
between radon and lung cancer

west european bankers are 
offering the soviets huge amounts of credit to use in modernizing 
their consumer economy but japans relations with moscow are cool 
and its bankers are holding back 
state department sources in washington emphasize that the deals 
do not involve direct loans but lines of credit which become 
loans only as the available credit is used 
they said the credit lines appear designed to finance specific 
trade arrangements and cannot be classed as untied loans 
money to be spent however the borrower chooses 
the unites states does not oppose lending at market rates for 
nonstrategic purposes but is against government subsidies of 
loans the sources said on condition of anonymity 
peter pietsch a finance and trade expert with west germanys 
commerzbank told the associated press credit not only from west 
germany but from all of western europe will be increasing and 
expanding in coming years 
this has to do with the soviet unions goal of opening up 
politically and economically which also includes an increase in 
trade activities said pietsch whose institution is the 
thirdlargest private bank in the country 
the soviets can only accomplish more activity in trade if they 
have enough loans from western countries by helping the soviet 
union modernize now we can create the climate and conditions for 
an even larger trade market in the future 
commerzbank is part of a consortium of west german banks led 
by deutsche bank the countrys largest that arranged a credit of 
16 billion 
it was established to finance west german exports to the soviet 
union particularly in the food leather textile and clothing 
industries 
officials signed the agreement oct 17 a week before chancellor 
helmut kohl began a visit to moscow that is expected to produce 
major benefits for west german businesses eager to expand trade 
other bankers in western europe are either following the german 
lead or preparing to do so 
on oct 14 italy set up an export credit worth 775 million it 
said was intended to help the soviets modernize with the money to 
be used only to buy machinery in italy for the production of 
consumer goods a group of banks led by the stateowned 
mediocredito centrale organized the deal 
london bankers involved in trade talks between britain and the 
soviet union confirmed thursday they were willing to provide a 
credit of 174 billion 
sir michael palliser deputy chairman of midland bank plc told 
a news conference the banks had agreed on a package of proposals 
and a representative of the group would make a formal proposal next 
week in moscow 
bankers said 85 percent of the credit line would be backed by 
the british governments export credits guarantee department 
other banks involved are the londonbased moscow narodny bank 
ltd barclays lloyds bank national westminster bank of 
scotland and morgan grenfell group 
alan clarke and konstantin katushev the british and soviet 
trade ministers also announced an agreement thursday for 
manufacturing of light commercial vehicles in the soviet union 
worth up to 297 million and a small joint venture in photocopying 
katushev said the british credit line and those from west 
germany and italy would be used primarily to modernize light 
industry 
we have enterprises with equipment that doesnt meet modern 
requirements and we have enterprises that dont have enough 
capacity he said 
in france the respected newspaper le monde reported last week 
that a french consortium was proposing a credit to the soviet union 
worth about 2 billion it said the group of banks was led by 
credit lyonnais frances secondlargest 
francois riche spokesman for credit lyonnais would not comment 
on the le monde report but confirmed that jeanyves haberer the 
bank president would travel to the soviet union on nov 10 
riche said credit lyonnais has had frequent dealings with the 
soviets over many years 
japanese bankers are taking a much more cautious approach an 
analyst with the longterm credit bank in tokyo said similar large 
credits from his and other private japanese institutions are 
unlikely mainly because of cool sovietjapanese relations 
resulting from a territorial dispute 
the government attitude toward the soviets is not really 
clear so it is rather difficult for commercial banks to get 
together and form a loan credit as they are currently doing in 
europe he said on condition of anonymity 
an analyst with the industrial bank of japan added that 
consortiums are not necessary in his country because japanese banks 
nearly alway negotiate individually the soviet union has not 
asked us for the loan credit he said 
japan and the kremlin still have not signed a world war ii peace 
treaty and japan demands the return of islands off hokkaido taken 
by the soviets

jesse jackson supporters who felt overlooked 
by michael dukakis have gained strategic positions in the 
democratic presidential campaign although jacksons former manager 
said it may be too little too late 
the kind of campaign we have going on in michigan the kind of 
campaign we have going on in ohio is the kind of campaign we 
should have had going on since labor day said former jackson 
campaign manager gerald austin 
in michigan where dukakis lost to jackson in a caucus landslide 
in march joel ferguson had been complaining that once the 
massachusetts governor secured the democratic presidential 
nomination he sent in a bunch of outoftowners to run his general 
election campaign 
ferguson who had managed jacksons campaign in the state said 
a month ago that jackson people virtually were being ignored and 
that it could cost dukakis the election in michigan 
this week as dukakis barnstormed the state to revive his 
sagging candidacy ferguson was flying on the candidates plane 
with him 
they listened to him and i think you have a better campaign 
in michigan because joel is involved austin said in a telephone 
interview 
in the first weeks after the democratic national convention last 
july the dukakis campaign did hire former jackson supporters but 
few had meaningful positions austin said 
but ron brown who was jacksons convention manager and now is 
an unpaid senior political adviser to the dukakis campaign said he 
was unaware of anyone being brought into the dukakis campaign 
strictly for appearances sake 
brown said the dukakis campaign started bringing in jackson 
people right after the national convention although he 
acknowledged the process was slow at the campaigns boston 
headquarters and spotty in the state organizations 
im not saying it was a perfectly smooth transition in every 
state brown said it wasnt 
black voters did not appear to have been impressed by those 
early efforts a gallup poll of 643 black voters taken in august 
for the joint center for political studies found that 42 percent 
thought jackson had been mistreated at the national convention and 
a third of that group said they were less likely to vote because of 
it 
nationwide the dukakis campaign began moving former jackson 
operatives into responsible jobs in late september and early 
october austin said 
it could be too little too late austin said i hope not 
brown himself was brought into the dukakis campaign in an 
official capacity three weeks ago his volunteer status is by his 
own choice he said 
austin said things began changing in september after the return 
of john sasso who resigned from the dukakis campaign last year 
following his admission of torpedoing sen joseph bidens candidacy 
for the democratic presidential nomination one of sassos first 
actions after rejoining the campaign was to meet with jackson 
i think now jackson speaks to dukakis two or three times a 
week austin said i think he talks to sasso even more 
jackson also is traveling around the country to rally support 
for the democratic ticket and has made radio commercials urging 
people to vote 
dukakis attended a sunday breakfast in boston with jackson and 
eight other black political leaders who pledged to support the 
massachusetts governors campaign in the remaining two weeks before 
election 
in mississippi and louisiana among the dozen states and 
territories jackson won during the primaries the dukakis campaign 
had little choice but to include jackson supporters because they 
control the state party 
in alabama another jackson state the problem hasnt been 
getting dukakis to pay attention to the jackson people but getting 
him to pay attention to alabama said state sen michael figures a 
jackson campaign leader in the state dukakis has been there only 
once and vice presidential running mate lloyd bentsen has not 
campaigned there at all 
similar disappointment was expressed by former jackson delegates 
in new jersey which has 16 electoral votes 
he goes to union but not newark said newark mayor sharpe 
james he goes to a college campus but not camden or trenton

many rural communities searching for economic 
revival hope to attract hightech industry but an agriculture 
department researcher says they should think twice before investing 
much time or money in the effort 
a new factory to design or build gadgets for space robots might 
seem the opportunity of the century with hundreds of new jobs and 
a fat monthly payroll 
but james p miller of the departments economic research 
service says that dream is hard to make come true 
in some cases he says computer and other hightech companies 
do locate research and development operations in the countryside 
but usually this is done only when local resources such as 
research facilities match their needs 
more often rural communities wind up with the most routine 
assembly tasks of the hightech companies because of the 
lowerskilled work involved and lower wages miller says 
consequently local development leaders shouldnt be overly 
optimistic 
hightech firms may not be as footloose as many have been led 
to believe particularly when they are in their most innovative 
state of development miller writes in a forthcoming issue of 
farmline magazine 
but communities keep trying and he says it is easy to see why 
they do jobs and incomes have been lost in agriculture mining 
forestry and lowwage lowtechnology manufacturing 
some planners believe that rural areas should attempt to 
encourage investment in the fastgrowing hightechnology industries 
because these industries are clean and are perceived to pay high 
wages miller said 
the hightech industries most often include communications 
electronics defense systems computers and software some of the 
sophisticated products are guided missile components and 
engineering and medical instruments 
miller said states and local communities are committing an 
increasing share of their scarce economic development resources to 
hightech development programs one recent report he said cited 
38 such programs in 22 states 
but so far miller said studies show that the clear tendency is 
for new hightech facilities to locate in urban areas 
computer manufacturing and software industries showed the 
strongest tendencies among highlevel rampd industries to concentrate 
in metro areas he said new computer manufacturing 
establishments tended to locate in urban areas primarily in the 
northeast and west but they were poorly represented in rural areas 
of every part of the country except new england where many rural 
areas are highly integrated with urban areas 
on the other hand rural areas can attract lowtech industries 
involved in noninnovative routine production activities miller 
said and there are always exceptions in which rural areas appeal 
to certain kinds of hightech companies sometimes because those 
operations are unwelcome in big cities 
rural areas in most parts of the country tend to have a 
comparative advantage in the production of chemical products and 
to a lesser extent petroleum refining ordnance radio and tv 
manufacturing and the assembly of electrical apparatus he said 
it is also clear that hightech companies dont usually move 
themselves lock stock and barrel into the countryside 
locally owned independent firms account for only about 11 
percent of all jobs created by new hightech firms in rural 
america miller said corporate affiliates are the dominant 
form of new hightech business activity in rural areas comprising 
nearly 90 percent of the jobs in such industries 
miller said hightech firms particularly those in innovative 
and development phases are attracted to cities by the availability 
of professional and skilled workers investment capital and close 
contact with customers suppliers and other hightech companies 
in contrast hightech facilities that are located in rural 
areas are likely to be affiliates of urbanbased corporations that 
have opened remote assembly plants in order to avoid high costs of 
labor land and other production items 
large corporations based in cities tend to expand research 
facilities in good times and reduce or eliminate them in bad times 
with those located farthest from urban centers being most likely to 
experience large changes in employment miller said

president reagans drive to remake the 
judiciary in his own conservative image moved fitfully through the 
100th congress but at sessions end his nominees filled more than 
half the federal court seats in america 
reagan lost the bruising battle to send robert h bork to the 
supreme court after senators rejected the nominees rigid 
ideological views especially his opinion that the constitution 
does not explicitly grant a right of privacy 
but reagan later won 970 confirmation for lowkey justice 
anthony m kennedy who may well rule as conservatively as bork 
and while senate republicans accused democrats of stalling 
reagan judicial nominees the president saw the 100th congress 
confirm 91 of 110 selections to us courts 
the 19 nominees not confirmed compared to 17 in the presidential 
year of 1980 when democrats controlled the senate and the white 
house and 16 in the presidential year of 1984 when republicans 
controlled the senate and the white house 
the president has had a longstanding goal of replacing liberal 
judges with conservatives his nominees now constitute 384 of the 
nations 752 federal judges on fulltime status 
to the chairman of the senate judiciary committee the 100th 
congress set new standards for close scrutiny of judicial nominees 
sen joseph r biden jr ddel said his panel sent future 
presidents the message that senators have the right to go beyond 
traditional questions about a supreme court nominees character 
the senate made clear in the bork nomination he said that it 
can consider whether a nominees views are philosophically 
appropriate for the times 
bork was defeated by the senate 5842 in october 1987 after 
furious campaigns by his supporters and opponents the battle was 
fought out on television in committee hearings paid commercials 
and floor sessions 
but democrats and republicans liberals and conservatives now 
agree that the reagan nominees who were confirmed by the senate are 
having a significant impact on the court system 
its very difficult for minorities or women to win affirmative 
action cases when reagan appointees control the court as they do in 
many circuits now said law professor herman schwartz of american 
university referring to the us courts of appeals 
in the district of columbia circuit a lot of environmental 
cases are being thrown out on grounds of standing 
schwartz a former democratic staffer on the senate judiciary 
committee predicted that until the supreme court rules on major 
abortion cases reagan appellate court nominees will generally 
uphold many of the obstacles state and local governments throw 
up to make abortions more difficult 
schwartz noted that two reagan nominees on the district of 
columbia circuit constituted the majority on an appellate panel 
that ruled the independent counsel law violated the constitution 
the reagan administrations position 
the supreme court reversed them 71 thus upholding the law that 
allows a courtappointed counsel to investigate and prosecute top 
government officials justice kennedy did not participate 
patrick mcguigan a conservative and senior scholar at the free 
congress center for law and democracy said the picture you get 
of reagans 50 percent is that half are principled conservatives 
and the remaining range from soso to outright turkeys 
mcguigan who believes judges should honor the constitution 
and legislative intent not the liberal agenda said that 
onequarter of the federal judiciary is now strict construction 
conservatives opposed in every fiber of their being to judicial 
lawmaking 
mcguigan said another quarter to a third of the judiciary is 
generally conservative but can be swayed by clever lawyering 
the remainder are committed judicial activists a number of 
them very capable highly intelligent and assertive he said 
nan aron cochair of the alliance for justice an organization 
of public interest legal groups credits the democraticled 
judiciary committee with exercising more scrutiny than when the 
panel was under gop control 
she said the long committee debate over bork set in motion a 
much larger public debate over the role of the courts 
in many peoples minds it established thresholds for 
standards below which nominees wouldnt be confirmed nominees were 
judged not only on their quality and integrity but their judicial 
philosophy and what they think the role of the courts are she 
said 
since reagan transformed the bench in an unprecedented 
fashion the committee will be very sensitive toward confirming 
people with clearly defined political views or ideological views

war and famine have turned sudan africas 
largest nation into a vast morgue besides the dead there are the 
uprooted seeking food where there is none here is a report on the 
situation 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
hyenas crept into the town at night 
dragged away emaciated corpses and devoured them in the bush the 
starving residents who remained alive were too weak to bury the 
dead 
about 3000 people have died of starvation since july at the 
town called abyei in southwestern sudan an area of despair 
afflicted by civil war and famine 
abyeis dead are among at least 250000 people who foreign 
relief officials say have died this year of starvation or 
inadequate medical care prime minister sadek elmahdi claims the 
estimate is 20 times the actual figure 
abyei was unknown to the world until the united states announced 
a 1 million program this month to fly 90 tons of grain over a 
10day period to the town 500 miles southwest of khartoum 
drought and five years of civil war have made famine endemic to 
three sudanese provinces south of abyei 
us officials decided on the relief program because of reports 
of mass starvation in the town which had been overrun by thousands 
driven from their homes by the war 
the un childrens fund joined in with special highprotein 
food for children unicef officials say the relief programs saved 
5000 children from certain death 
videotape brought from the town last week showed children with 
heads too large for their shrunken bodies many had the sunken eyes 
and dull orange hair of extreme malnutrition 
cole dodge a unicef representative told reporters after 
returning from abyei even an intensive care unit in new york 
would find it hard to save these kids some are so far gone 
western and sudanese relief officials said 2 million southerners 
have been turned into refugees by fighting between government 
soldiers and the rebel sudan peoples liberation army they say 
about 13 million of those were forced from their homes this year 
some set out on foot for northern sudan others for ethiopia to 
the east many died on the way those who made it to other parts of 
sudan found little food 
relief workers who flew to abyei with the airlift gave this 
description 
grass and shrubs cover the narrow airstrip because of the 
heaviest summer rains since 1946 which turned abyei into a virtual 
island and trapped 3000040000 people with only enough food for 
15000 
most were old men women and children because strong men were 
fighting in the civil war 
refugees arrived in abyei with accounts of trudging through 
swampland for weeks eating leaves and being attacked by rebel 
bands who took what little food and clothing the victims had 
some western relief workers say the rebels are trying to make 
people move north creating problems for the government in 
khartoum the rebels seek greater autonomy from the 
moslemdominated north for southern sudan most of whose people are 
christian or animist 
the first uschartered planes arrived oct 13 in abyei which 
consists of 1215 permanent structures and thousands of huts built 
of sticks and grass 
feeblelooking men came to the twinengine cessna in ragged 
shorts and tattered remnants of flowing robes 
relief officials say the 90 tons of supplies and the unicef food 
for children should last until the rainy season ends in about two 
weeks and trucks can reach abyei again but they fear about 50000 
more refugees also may arrive then 
families get weekly allotments of grain the red crescent the 
moslem equivalent of the red cross handles distribution 
videotapes from abyei show children aged 410 crowding the 
unicef feeding quarters with bowls to receive a porridgelike food 
called unimix from huge containers 
the children are fed three times a day they sit in the dusty 
walledin yard under shades of grass and bamboo some smiling and 
chatting others slowly eating from wooden or plastic bowls 
scraping up every remaining bit with their fingers 
unicef officials believe many children died on the way to abyei 
or before the food came they said the number of adults at abyei 
should have many more children than the 5000 in the town 
people are just completely emaciated it was a situation of 
absolute destitution dodge said 
unicef officials say the summer estimate of 80 deaths a day in 
abyei was reduced to 10 daily this month they say the rate appears 
even lower in the latter part of october 
no clear picture is available of the situation in the wartorn 
regions of bahr elghazal equatoria and upper nile 
relief officials and reporters cannot get into many parts of the 
war zone where the rebels control about 90 percent of the 
countryside

engineers in the star wars program say 
progress in miniaturized electronics is central to the pentagons 
recent estimate that the first phase of an antimissile defense 
system would cost 69 billion rather than a previously forecast 
115 billion 
to illustrate the point john p peller of rockwell 
international removes his tie clip and shows visitors that it is 
actually an accelerometer a measuring and computing device 
that 20 years ago would have filled a small room 
we feel that we will have achieved success when we can bring 
all the hardware in the program in our tie tacks said peller a 
rockwell vice president in charge of the companys program to 
develop spacebased weapons designed to smash enemy missiles 
dozens of engineers and scientists involved in star wars 
formally known as the strategic defense initiative made similar 
points showing off tiny devices that are a fraction of cost size 
and weight of earlier generations of technology 
mass producing them in the quantities needed for star wars would 
drastically cut costs the same way it has cut the prices of 
consumer electronic devices such as computers and stereo systems 
among the cost and size reductions cited by peller were an 
inertial measurement unit down from 40 pounds and 70000 to six 
ounces and 8000 and a rocket thruster down from 19 pounds and 
150000 in the 1960s to onetenth of a pound and 20000 today 
reduced weight means that a system is easier and cheaper to 
launch and keep in orbit 
and in an era of tight budgets a 69 billion program may be 
easier to sell than one costing twice that 
but the drop in the estimated price has not calmed capitol hill 
fears that star wars will not work 
rep john m spratt dsc of the house armed services 
committee said he was unsure that costs can be cut by half 
without eroding performance 
this system might actually be more fragile than the earlier 
costlier system spratt said during an oct 6 hearing at which sdi 
officials explained the change 
furthermore deployment of spacebased defenses would break the 
1972 antiballistic missile treaty and unless it is part of a 
detailed arms control framework would unleash a new round in the 
arms race as the superpowers hurried to deploy defensive as well as 
offensive weapons 
reagan administration officials say sdi research funded at 41 
billion for fiscal 1989 will allow a decision in the mid1990s on 
whether to develop an antimissile defense with deployment in the 
late 1990s or early 21st century 
kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev has acknowledged that the 
soviets are working on a parallel program pentagon analysts say 
that the soviets are spending billion of rubles annually on 
antimissile defenses and are ahead in such areas as laser 
development 
after president reagan launched sdi in march 1983 public debate 
centered on whether exotic defenses such as lasers could form a 
defensive umbrella to protect the continental united states from 
soviet missiles 
the 69 billion system outlined by scientists and engineers is 
considerably less ambitious and has the goal of knocking down 
about 30 percent of the soviets more than 10000 warheads denying 
them the certainty of being able to destroy the us nuclear 
arsenal in a bolt from the blue attack 
scientists and engineers at the national weapons laboratories 
rockwell and other defense contractors are hard at work developing 
a twotier system which would include one layer of antimissile 
missiles based on the ground and another parked aboard satellites 
in low orbit less than 180 miles high 
edward teller the atomic physicist credited with planting the 
seed of sdi in reagans mind was initially skeptical of the 
socalled kinetic kill vehicles which destroy warheads by 
running into them he had originally called for a spacebased 
defense using more exotic technology in particular the xray 
laser powered by nuclear weapons exploded in space 
but now teller is leaning toward a kinetic or collision system 
which would rely neither on nuclear weapons nor on nuclear reactors 
in space 
progress in miniaturization in the development of good 
sensors and in the realm of advanced computation this made it 
possible to make the kinetic energy component small and less 
expensive said teller 80 known as the father of the hydrogen 
bomb 
the pentagons current plans for a phase one deployment teller 
said in an interview would be an important gateway to a more 
complete and advanced system later 
the first elements of the system to go into orbit will be about 
10 boost surveillance and tracking systems bsts air force 
satellites costing about 400 million apiece starting in the 
mid1990s these satellites are expected to perform a variety of 
reconnaissance and communications missions not immediately linked 
to star wars said mel r brashears head of the bsts program at 
the lockheed missiles and space company in sunnyvale calif 
if congress and the administration agree to deploy an 
antimissile system more bsts satellites can be added to give 
early warning of soviet rocket launches said brashears 
the current pentagon vision of an antimissile defense involves 
two more satellite complexes the space surveillance and tracking 
system ssts orbiting several thousand miles above the earth 
would relay more detailed information on enemy boosters to another 
lower complex 147 satellites each weighing about 6600 pounds and 
carrying about 10 spacebased interceptors 
the ssts would send the spaceinterceptor platform what we 
call a wakeup call said peller of rockwell 
under the new lower cost plan the weapons platforms would 
surrender much of their tracking capability to the ssts satellites 
and to the interceptors themselves 
but that worries some critics who note that because there are 
fewer ssts they will make an easier target for soviet weapons 
in addition to the spacebased interceptors and sensors the 
united states would also build an undisclosed number of facilities 
to launch groundbased antimissile missiles these would hit 
warheads above 300000 feet in altitude as the bombs begin their 
final descent 
lockheed officials hope to fly a prototype in 1990 and to drop 
the cost for each of the estimated 3000 missiles to 1 million a 
copy down from the current projected cost of 10 million apiece 
said rex hahn an engineer at the corporations sprawling facility 
in sunnyvale

irans efforts to restore normal 
relations with the rest of the world have gathered momentum in 
recent weeks but there appears no attempt to achieve a 
rapprochement with the united states 
france and canada have restored relations with the tehran 
government and there are moves to restore links with the countries 
of western europe eastern europe and the persian gulf that 
includes saudi arabia irans main rival in the moslem world 
there is no reason for us to quarrel with the countries in the 
south of the persian gulf parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani 
declared recently 
saudi arabia whose population is predominantly sunni moslem 
severed relations with iran dominated by the rival shiite sect 
last april citing terorrism and subversion 
to restore ties with the united states the great satan 
would climax irans widening links with the outside world but it 
remains a distant prospect 
the united states severed relations nine years ago when the us 
embassy in tehran was stormed and diplomats held hostage for 444 
days 
we can see no reason to reserve a special place for the united 
states mohammad javad larijani deputy foreign minister for us 
and european affairs said in a recent interview with tehrans 
resaalat daily 
we have done without it for the last 10 years and can do 
without it for another 100 years 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini stressed earlier this month that as 
long as he lives there will be no deviation from the ideals of the 
islamic revolution including dealings with the criminal soviets 
and worlddevouring america 
nonetheless in recent months tehran has restored relations 
with france after a years rift and with canada which closed its 
tehran embassy in 1980 after its diplomats sheltered several 
americans and smuggled them to safety 
the iranians are discussing normalizing relations with britain 
frozen a year ago have opened an embassy in new zealand are 
upgrading relations with the dutch italians and west germans and 
seeking to improve ties with the east bloc 
the iranians are also normalizing relations with kuwait that 
were all but severed during the 8yearold war with iraq when the 
northern gulf state was a target for iranian missiles and saboteurs 
rafsanjani the most powerful figure in iran after khomeini is 
the main architect of irans new foreign policy 
khomeini clearly had given rafsanjanis foreign policy his 
blessing but the quickening pace of the speakers bridgebuilding 
has alarmed tehrans radicals khomeinis strictures earlier this 
month appeared to be a caution to rafsanjani to tread warily 
irans isolation because of the islamic revolutions fierce 
antiwestern ideology and support for terrorism by fundamentalist 
shiite moslems cost it dearly during the gulf war 
rafsanjani aided by foreign minister ali akbar velayati began 
opening doors two years ago 
but his efforts gathered momentum after the tehran government 
at his urging unconditionally accepted a united nationssponsored 
ceasefire july 18 following a string of military defeats by iraq 
the ceasefire which took effect aug 20 triggered an intense 
debate in tehran over how to tackle the massive task of postwar 
reconstruction and how far iran should go in opening its doors to 
foreign capital to pay for it 
president ali khamanei declared last month we have bitter 
experience of foreign investment in our country but this will not 
be an obstacle to countries wanting to have healthy trade and 
economic relations with us 
he and rafsanjani have stressed that irans revolutionary ideals 
must not be jeopardized by opening up to foreign imports and 
companies to revive the warbattered economy 
but they recognize that irans 50 million people are weary of 
wartime austerity and that tehran needs foreign money to rebuild 
its economy and create jobs 
hardline radicals such as prime minister hussein musavi and 
interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi insist on limited foreign 
intervention and tight state control of the economy 
a completely opendoor policy is out of the question musavi 
said in an interview with the londonbased middle east economic 
digest his first with a western publication 
rafsanjani has not changed the direction of irans foreign 
policy because he has any great love for the west but economic 
political and military imperatives apparently convinced him that 
the revolutions longterm prospects of survival lay in ending the 
war and reaching out to the world 
musavi tried to resign in august claiming among other things 
that rafsanjani and others did not consult him on foreign policy 
khomeini ordered him to stop rocking the boat 
us officials have said washington is prepared to discuss 
restoring relations with tehran once it stops supporting terrorism 
and the nine american hostages in lebanon are freed 
but rafsanjani must move cautiously because of widespread 
hostility toward the united states fueled by its naval 
intervention in the persian gulf and the shooting down of an 
iranian airliner in july killing all 290 people aboard 
larijani said in the resaalat interview if the americans 
change their hostile policies and opt for mutual respect and 
nonintervention in iranian affairs our relations with the united 
states will be like those with any other country

a storm that threatened to grow 
into a hurricane for the second time skirted central americas 
pacific coast sunday and el salvador declared a state of emergency 
hurricane joan which was renamed tropical storm miriam on 
sunday when it weakened after sweeping across nicaragua from the 
atlantic to the pacific killed more than 100 people over the past 
week as it churned along the caribbean coast 
it thrashed nicaragua on saturday and sunday killing at least 
50 people and leaving some 300000 homeless 
the storms 125 mph winds weakened to tropicalstorm strength 
along the way but when it reached the warm waters of the pacific 
it began to strengthen again and move up the coast to honduras and 
el salvador 
forecasters gave it a new name miriam from the 1988 list for 
pacific storms and said it could become the first atlantic 
hurricane to gain the same status in the pacific 
at 11 pm edt miriam was about 50 miles southsoutheast of san 
salvador with maximum sustained winds of about 55 mph according 
to the national hurricane center in coral gables fla the storm 
was moving in a westnorthwestly direction at almost 10 mph 
it almost looks like a hurricane now said forecaster randy 
lascody as soon as it got over the water offshore it started to 
strengthen again 
in el salvador the government declared a nationwide state of 
emergency and evacuations were ordered in floodprone areas of the 
southeast 
honduras may be getting some of the fringe effects it 
eventually will get up to guatemala maybe southern mexico said 
lascody 
that would mean miriamjoan would create havoc in every country 
in central america except belize early last week it also caused 
deaths and destruction in colombia and venezuela 
lascody said he believed that only three atlantic storms in the 
past 100 years made it to tropical storm status in the pacific and 
none made it to hurricane strength 
hurricane joan left a tremendous trail of destruction through 
nicaragua costa rica panama colombia and venezuela 
heavy rain continued to fall in western nicaragua and 
northwestern costa rica while rain began falling in southwestern 
honduras and southeastern el salvador 
roads were closed crops damaged and communications cut 
throughout the area especially in nicaragua 
in costa rica authorities said 1500 homes were destroyed six 
hospitals and health centers severely damaged and 55000 people 
were evacuated schools and universities were to remain closed 
monday 
panamanian officials said 2000 people were left homeless and 
the panamerican highway remained closed in panama for a third day 
because of mudslides 
the panamanian government loaned two helicopters to costa rica 
to help rescue flood victims

to hear george bush tell it democrat michael 
dukakis is against every new weapons system since the 
slingshot from the dukakis perspective bush was winking and 
nodding while panamas manuel antonio noriega went wild dealing 
drugs 
both assertions are part of campaign 88 and neither bears much 
relation to provable fact 
but they typify a campaign in which befuddled voters are 
bombarded with negative campaign information and are faced with a 
nearly impossible task of sorting out fact from distortion 
halftruth and flatout fiction 
i dont recall an election where the ads have been as negative 
as this year said political analyst william schneider of the 
american enterprise institute in washington if things arent 
going too badly and the election looks like its going to be 
close theyve got to have something to talk about so they talk 
about each other 
most recently dukakis was angrily displaying campaign 
literature mailed out by the state republican party in illinois 
which he called political garbage the brochure alleged that 
dukakis let murderers rapists and child molesters free on 
weekend passes and suggested that in dukakis home state of 
massachusetts illinois mass murderer john wayne gacy now on death 
row would be allowed to go free 
the bush campaign disavowed any connection with the fliers 
which cite the case of murderer willie horton who escaped while on 
a weekend furlough from massachusetts prison then raped a maryland 
woman and slashed her boyfriend 
dukakis aides said gacy would have been ineligible for release 
under terms of the furlough program which has since been amended 
schneider said the candidates are careful about outright 
lying but that in an era of complex issues the advertisements 
and campaign slogans become more and more simpleminded 
for instance dukakis ads claim bush personally cast the 
tiebreaking vote to cut social security benefits 
but in reality that 1985 vote by bush as vice president was not 
to cut social security but to temporarily freeze social security 
costofliving increases as part of a broad budget resolution 
dukakis as a member of the national governors conference had 
voted in favor of the same thing as part of a package of economic 
recommendations but dukakis said he had first fought 
unsuccessfully to exempt social security from the federal budget 
freeze 
the democrats also like to zing bush on drugs by linking him to 
panamas noriega who is currently under indictment on federal drug 
charges 
a dukakis ad states that bush was made responsible for 
stopping drug traffic from coming into this country a reference 
to bushs chairmanship of the south florida drug interdiction task 
force 
what happened the ad goes on cocaine traffic up 300 
percent more drugs in our classrooms and panamanian drug lord 
noriega kept on the government payroll 
there has been no proof that bush knew about noriegas drug 
connections before the justice department indicted him and bush 
has denied any such knowledge he counters allegations that the cia 
under the reaganbush administration kept noriega on the cia 
payroll by stating it was that same administration which indicted 
the panamanian 
dukakis is particularly miffed about bushs claim that he 
opposes new weapons systems in his strategy to portray his 
democratic rival as soft on defense bush often says on the stump 
that dukakis has opposed every weapons system since the slingshot 
and did not support president reagans invasion of grenada or his 
air attack on libya 
dukakis says he did not oppose the libya and grenada actions 
furthermore he says he supports various new military technology 
including the stealth bomber and the trident 2 seabased missile 
as well as development of a new advanced tactical fighter and 
nuclear attack submarines 
bush also has assailed dukakis for his states program to 
furlough prisoners bush neglects to note that the furlough system 
was installed by a republican governor who preceded dukakis 
dukakis responds by stating that other states and the federal 
government also have furlough programs under which criminals have 
escaped and committed further violent crimes including california 
under the governorship of ronald reagan

president pw bothas 
national party on a 40year winning streak is on the defensive 
against a farright onslaught heading into nationwide local 
elections wednesday 
conservative party leaders are confident of extensive gains as 
they promote plans to roll back modest racial reforms of recent 
years their vision of the future would subject blacks to curfews 
increased evictions even segregated elevators 
blacks as well as whites are eligible to vote for segregated 
municipal councils but ideology is not a significant factor in the 
black elections the issue is how many people heed the governments 
exhortations to vote despite calls for a boycott by antiapartheid 
activists 
even if the government announces a moderately high black 
turnout in the range of 30 or 40 percent the impact on national 
politics is likely to be minimal no blacks identified with major 
antiapartheid groups are seeking office many areas have no 
contested races and millions of black adults barred from 
national politics are not registered to vote 
under apartheid the black majority has no voice in national 
affairs while the white minority controls the economy and 
maintains separate schools and districts 
the white elections could have a profound effect on the 
countrys future a strong showing by the conservatives who won 
26 percent of the vote in a white general election last year 
could put them in a position to take power in the next 
parliamentary election expected by early 1990 
the conservatives approach election day in a supremely 
confident mood wrote richard humphries a political analyst at 
johannesburgs university of the witwatersrand party spokesmen 
refer to the elections as a practice run for gaining power 
the conservatives strongholds are in the farming towns and 
bluecollar urban areas of transvaal the most populous of the four 
provinces 
the conservatives are given an outside chance of seizing power 
in pretoria the administrative capital where defeat would be a 
major psychological blow to the nationalists 
the conservatives want to toughen enforcement of residential 
segregation and restore influx control which restricted blacks 
presence in urban areas 
they are campaigning on these issues even though they could not 
implement the changes unless they ended the national partys 
40year hold on national power however municipal councils have 
the power to segregate parks public buildings and transportation 
facilities 
an estimated 7 million of south africas 26 million blacks are 
shackdwelling squatters but the conservative party says they will 
have to be removed from the vicinity of white cities 
we are adamant that we wont allow squatters of any race 
said willie snyman an election coordinator for the conservatives 
they will have to go back to their place of origin 
conservative candidates propose a curfew that would bar blacks 
from streets in white communities after dark unless they had 
permits for night jobs they also want to segregate beaches some 
of which have been opened to all races 
a strong conservative party showing could give it veto power 
over the regional services councils set up over the past two years 
by the government to redistribute tax revenue to black townships 
you can vote for the conservative party if you do not care a 
damn about the black masses if you dont care a damn about what 
the rest of the world thinks said the citizen a progovernment 
paper in a recent editorial you vote for the national party if 
you believe that it is the vehicle for reform even if it is moving 
somewhat sluggishly at present 
many antiapartheid activists believe the nationalists differ 
from the conservatives only in a superficial willingness to appear 
moderate but there is sentiment in the black community that a 
racist crackdown by a conservative government could be the catalyst 
for a successful black revolt 
both the conservative and national parties are dominated by 
afrikaners the mainly dutchdescended ethnic group that makes up 
60 percent of the 5million white population

two mexican police officers were arrested after 
they offered to ship 110 pounds of heroin worth up to 50 million 
to the united states each month a drug enforcement 
administration spokesman said sunday 
these two defendants were using their positions in the 
acapulco region of mexico to safely transport the heroin to the 
united states said dea spokesman robert strang 
the heroin would have been manufactured in mexico and sent to

president miguel de la madrids radical 
streamlining of the mexican economy has suffered many blows in the 
final months of his term but a us offer of a 35 billion loan 
may create some breathing room 
without bragging i can declare that there is no other country 
in the world that has accomplished a rationalization of its 
productive apparatus as rapidly as we mexicans have said de la 
madrid who will step down on dec 1 in favor of his elected 
successor carlos salinas de gortari 
the president is optimistic that his efforts to reduce his 
countrys dependence on petroleum exports will boost mexico out of 
its recession which was compounded by the drop in the price of 
oil mexicos leading export the price of isthmus a major export 
grade of oil is about 1180 per barrel down from 1350 in 
august and 1481 in december 
export growth outside the oil sector the president argues is 
the key to mexicos future de la madrid has in the past few years 
gradually dismantled 40 years worth of protectionist trade 
barriers and forced domestic industry to try to become 
internationally competitive 
foreign revenues will enable mexico to service its 104 billion 
debt and enable it to resume economic growth and development 
de la madrids strategy has been rewarded with its first 
successes 
nonpetroleum export earnings through august 94 billion were 
double those brought in by oil and helped cushion the impact of 
depressed petroleum revenues manufacturing exports increased at a 
20 percent annual rate the first six months of the year and are 
continuing to grow 
but de la madrids program also has been battered this year 
the plunge in oil prices cost the country 2 billion to 2 
billion in lost incom 
cancun one of mexicos prime resorts was devastated by 
hurricane gilbert in september 
the summer drought intensified mexicos dependence on us 
agricultural products and jacked up its food import bill to 16 
billion 
mexicos trade surplus shrank to 1986 levels and most analysts 
say mexico was running a deficit last month the trade surplus 
through august was 25 billion down from 6 billion in the same 
period in 1987 according to government figures 
foreign creditors have balked at mexicos proposals to ease the 
estimated 12 billion it must pay this year to service the foreign 
debt 
nevertheless the healthier export sector was cause for 
celebration and the united states mexicos biggest trading 
partner seemed to agree 
on oct 17 the northern neighbor announced a 35 billion loan 
that will be granted only if mexico secures longterm loans 
promised by the world bank and other financial institutions 
the government was criticized for its willingness to increase 
mexicos foreign debt by accepting the us loan at time when the 
economy is in a recession partly induced by the government to ease 
inflationary pressures 
under a socalled economic solidarity pact with labor and 
business the president in february froze the minimum wage prices 
for goods and services and the pesodollar currency exchange rate 
officially the pact is working inflation dropped from a record 
1592 percent in 1987 to below 1 percent for the month of september 
but the recession also has cost the government dearly by forcing 
it to increase subsidies to stateowned firms whose incomes are 
frozen further subsidies have been used to support the peso freeze 
on currency markets and placate investor fears of a devaluation 
foreign exchange reserves which stood at 16 billion in april 
dropped to 12 billion in september analysts said another massive 
run on dollars occurred on oct 14 two days before presidentelect 
salinas announced he would maintain the peso freeze a month into 
his term 
cuts in government spending of 250 million announced this month 
had little impact on the whopping budget deficit which is more 
than 10 percent of mexicos gross domestic product and was 
aggravated by the fall in oil revenue in addition tax cuts and 
price freezes under the pact have aggravated the deficit 
why make the us loan now because the government is in a 
trap said jonathan heath director of the macro asesoria 
economic forecasting company they cant cut the deficit under 
the antiinflation program and they cant solve inflation without 
cutting the deficit 
on dec 1 salinas will inherit the reins of the reforms he 
designed as de la madrids budget minister 
the presidentelect faces substantial political fallout from his 
disputed election in july which opponenents claim was not honestly 
conducted 
and he has staked his claim to the presidency on a pledge to 
resume economic growth even if he must try to force concessions 
from mexicos creditors 
it is a pledge he cannot afford to ignore mexican workers have 
shouldered the brunt of austerity programs for six years and their 
wages buy no more today than they did in 1964 
theyve done everything their creditors have asked theyve 
done everything the imf has asked and theyre still in trouble 
heath said

although the 100th congress was one of the 
most productive congressional sessions in years it also left 
behind a lengthy list of unfinished business ranging from cleaning 
up the nations air to raising the minimum wage 
much remains to be tackled senate majority leader robert 
byrd dwva told his colleagues near the end of the session 
the 101st congress has some formidable challenges to address 
house republican leader bob michel rill agreed i think it 
was quite successful overall but there were also some things we 
didnt get that we would have liked 
many of the unresolved issues involve domestic policy fights 
such as the minimum wage familyrelated legislation and cleaning 
up the nations air 
the minimum wage has been 335 per hour since 1981 but 
democrats pushed in recent months for an increase a drive they 
hoped to turn into political gains during the election campaign 
the democrats who control congress succeeded in bringing to the 
senate floor a bill that would have raised the minimum wage to 
455 per hour over a threeyear period but republicans said they 
would filibuster unless the judiciary committee voted to approve 25 
of president reagans judicial appointments 
the senate tried to cut off debate but that move only picked up 
56 votes four short of the 60 needed that moved minimum wage 
legislation to the back burner 
a look at some of the other unfinished items

clean air the senate considered a bill which would have tried 
to control acid rain by restricting smokestack emissions along 
with tightening autoemission standards and restricting the burning 
of toxic chemicals but there was strong opposition in both the 
house and senate particularly from legislators representing states 
producing lowsulfur coal such as those in the rocky mountain area 
child care the senate health and labor committee voted 
approval in july of a bill providing 25 billion for child care 
with 75 percent of that amount ticketed for low and 
moderateincome families but opposition by a variety of groups 
including the national education association and the national 
parent teachers association stalled floor action they were 
opposed because some of the money would go to childcare centers 
sponsored by religious institutions 
parental leave democrats backed a proposal to require 
employers of 50 or more persons to give up to 10 weeks of unpaid 
parental and medical leave senate republicans attached an 
amendment making child pornography a federal crime and democrats 
tried to strip that provision out of the bill but failed 
impeachment the house voted 4133 on aug 3 to impeach us 
district court judge alcee l hastings of florida for high crimes 
and misdemeanors alleging perjury and conspiracy to receive a 
bribe the senate later decided to postpone the impeachment trial 
until 1989 
the house also delayed impeachment proceedings against us 
district judge walter l nixon jr of mississippi nixon is 
serving a fiveyear prison term for perjury 
south africa sanctions on aug 11 the house voted 244132 
approval of a bill to prohibit almost all trade with whiteruled 
south africa it would have also barred south african imports the 
senate foreign relations committee approved similar legislation 
but filibuster threats blocked any floor action 
airline consumer protection the house approved a bill 
requiring airlines to disclose information on flight delays and 
compensation for workers hurt by mergers the senate passed a 
similar bill but a housesenate conference committee called to 
resolve differences broke down in fighting over provisions for the 
random testing of transportation industry employees 
campaign finance reform senate democrats backed a bill capping 
the amount senators could receive from political action committees 
republicans filibustered and there were eight unsuccessful votes 
attempting to halt the filibuster during one procedural fight over 
the filibuster arrest warrants were issued for missing senators 
and sen robert packwood rore was brought forcibly to the 
senate floor 
nuclear treaties still awaiting action are a pair of treaties 
negotiated between the soviet union and united states more than a 
decade ago they would restrict nuclear explosions to no more than 
150 kilotons president reagan had promised to push for 
ratification if an improved method could be found to verify the 
pacts

its really the first time a major project of this sort has 
asked the question ahead of time what can we do to reduce our 
pest control problem and minimize the impact said william 
jackson head of the fourmember team 
usually you have rats in the mayors office or some such 
political crisis instead of looking at the problem longrange 
the artery the citys major highway through downtown is 
scheduled for reconstruction underground a third tunnel under 
boston harbor leading to logan international airport also is 
planned 
rat poisons not the solution to everyones problems 
jackson said the recommendations have to be tailored to the

a company is harvesting a steady yearround 
crop of spinach from seeds germinated in tiny polyester blankets 
unaffected by the vagaries of the weather and nourished without 
soil or sunshine 
this spinach feeds on a stream of liquid nutrients and grows 
during the night under the light of 1000watt bulbs the 
manufacturer says its method works better than mother nature 
it is a quality product and it commands a quality price but 
it has no competition after youve tasted it said kevin wallick 
plant scientist for the manufacturer phytofarms of america 
rain or shine the companys 50000squarefoot production 
center turns out a weekly crop of 10000 pounds of spinach along 
with smaller quantities of lettuce basil dill and the expensive 
and nuttyflavored arugula 
these products of hydroponics agriculture without soil are 
shipped to gourmet restaurants and supermarkets from washington 
state to new york and from texas to canada 
the produce is more tender than the fieldgrown variety wallick 
said its also clean and safe because it has never been in soil or 
sprayed with pesticides he added theres a dependable harvest 
every weekday of the year 
as a result customers pay five times the price of conventional 
greens for the companys crops wallick said 
a fourounce bag of the companys kitchen harvest spinach its 
main product retails for 198 one illinois grocery store was 
offering gardenvariety spinach for 89 cents a pound 
general mills built phytofarms plant in 1978 for about 10 
million noel davis a pioneer in the design of agricultural growth 
chambers directed the project and then bought the business in 1982 
company officials believe the concept will attract growing 
interest from consumers worried about pesticide residue and regions 
where the weather is adverse for conventional agriculture 
inquiries have come from canada japan and the soviet union the 
officials say 
officials say the plant produces 100 times the volume of lettuce 
per acre as conventional agriculture and nearly six times as much 
produce per acre as a greenhouse 
the lights come on at 10 pm each night at the center 
the plants dont grow according to their own physiology they 
grow in response to utility rates which go down at night and go 
out of sight during the day said davis 
the center located 60 miles west of chicago has 15 growth 
chambers each covered on all sides by shiny silver shades 
seeds are nestled in soft blankets that absorb water and placed 
in small plastic cubes about an inch square after the seeds 
germinate the cubes are placed over an opening in a conduit that 
carries liquid nutrients to the plants roots 
each patented light bulb is surrounded by a waterfilled globe 
that captures the heat and keeps the crops from getting scorched 
in winter the captured heat is redistributed to warm the building 
greatly lowering energy costs 
the 18footlong aluminum conduits that hold the plants lie 
across a long table in each chamber and rotate slowly and 
automatically from the front of the chamber after planting to the 
back for harvest it takes just 28 days for each conduit to pass 
down the roughly 150foot chamber and bring its crop to harvest 
the crop comes to the workers rather than having the workers 
crawling on their hands and knees to get to the crop said 
wallick

michael dukakis and george bush both oppose 
oil import fees to help the depressed us oil industry one of the 
few areas of energy policy on which the presidential candidates 
agree 
in interviews last week dukakis adviser jack riggs and bush 
adviser william martin said the next president will have to make 
tradeoffs between energy and the environment 
there is almost always going to be a conflict between some of 
our energy policies and some of our environmental policies said 
riggs majority staff director of the energy and power subcommittee 
of the house energy and commerce committee 
martin a former deputy energy secretary said were going to 
find instances where energy security objectives and environmental 
objectives are going to go head to head against each other 
they were interviewed for a radio program energy update 
whose tapes are produced by americans for energy independence a 
study organization supported by unions companies and others 
interested in a strong domestic energy supply the tapes will be 
broadcast in the two weeks before the election 
there are both differences and similarities between the 
candidates 
some differences 
bush favors exploration of the arctic national wildlife refuge 
in alaska a good drilling prospect dukakis opposes it 
dukakis would keep motor vehicle mileage standards but opposes 
standards that directly cause a major penalty to the us 
economy bush would drop the standards 
some similarities 
both candidates favor tax incentives to encourage domestic oil 
production and oppose new tariffs sometimes called import fees 
both oppose other energy taxes such as higher gasoline taxes 
or a levy on the carbon content of fuels at the moment dukakis 
would consider them if new revenue were needed but would resist 
taxes that would hurt one segment of the industry more than another 
both expect and favor major growth in natural gas as an energy 
source 
some shadings 
bush believes in nuclear power but recognizes it does have a 
problem of public confidence and safety dukakis believes we 
cannot even begin to consider promoting nuclear power as part of 
our energy mix without a new generation of safer reactors a 
solution to the waste disposal problem and stronger safety 
oversight 
opposition from dukakis has helped prevent the startup of a 
nuclear plant in new hampshire just over the state line 
dukakis believes the nation needs a core supply of domestic 
oil production currently about 82 million barrels a day or 9 
percent below the decades peak year of 1985 some 300000 jobs 
have been lost since then 
i have not seen anything from gov dukakis that would try to 
put that in barrels per day or a percentage of our energy needs 
riggs said 
dukakis opposes a higher tariff because it is a tremendously 
inefficient way to raise revenue and a tremendously inefficient way 
to help energy industries riggs said it would help domestic 
energy industries by putting huge burdens on farmers and business 
and consumers 
martin was principal author of a departmental report last year 
concluding a major oil tariff would cost the economy almost three 
times as many jobs as it would restore to the domestic oil industry 
while some energy objectives might be realized through taxes 
in the case of a gasoline tax you might conserve more in the case 
of an import fee we might produce more the fact is there is a 
penalty on the economy as a whole martin said 
martin said tax incentives favored by bush could increase 
production by 600000 barrels a day and cost 600 million in annual 
tax revenue

the us indictment of ferdinand 
marcos spares the philippines from risking political instability by 
charging the former president with crimes and allowing him to 
return for the trial 
on friday a federal grand jury in new york indicted marcos and 
his wife imelda on racketeering charges for allegedly looting more 
than 100 million from their homeland to buy real estate and other 
properties in new york 
it was the first time marcos had been charged with any crime 
despite widespread allegations of corruption during his 20year 
administration 
philippine authorities conceded that prospects for retrieving 
the billions of dollars marcos allegedly embezzled were bleak 
unless the ousted president were formally charged with crimes 
but the philippine constitution bans trials in absentia and 
marcos made it clear he would demand to return from exile in hawaii 
and conduct his own defense 
the philippine military warned civilian authorities that marcos 
thousands of diehard followers would use the return of their 
former leader to stage demonstrations and other destabilization 
acts 
marcos supporters are blamed for some of the six major coup 
attempts against president corazon aquino several alleged 
ringleaders including former brig gen jose maria zumel and 
former lt col reynaldo cabauatan remain at large 
filipino officials also said they would face a monumental task 
in preventing marcos enemies from assassinating him that would 
have raised the horrific specter of a repeat of the aug 21 1983 
slaying of mrs aquinos husband benigno aquino jr who was 
killed while under military guard just as he returned from the 
united states to challenge marcos rule 
following fridays indictment ramon diaz former chairman of 
the presidential commission on good government said the american 
legal moves will save the philippines a lot of trouble and 
achieve what we wanted to do retrieve marcos alleged stolen 
riches 
us officials have said any funds proven embezzled would be 
returned to the rightful owner presumably the philippine 
government 
the dilemma posed by the need to maintain stability and the 
desire the retrieve marcos alleged illgotten wealth has 
dogged the aquino administration since it took office feb 25 1986 
after a popular uprising toppled marcos 
in june swiss authorities made clear they would not lift 
banking secrecy laws covering marcos alleged secret accounts in 
switzerland in the absence of a criminal case 
for years the philippine government struggled to find a 
solution to the dilemma 
in 1987 solicitorgeneral francisco chavez proposed the 
government ask the united states to allow the philippine 
anticorruption court to try marcos in hawaii where he fled after 
the 1986 uprising 
us officials successfully lobbied strongly against the plan 
american sources speaking on condition of anonymity said they 
urged filipino authorities not to make a formal request because it 
would surely be rejected to the embarrassment of both governments 
officials also considered holding the trial at a remote resort 
on the bataan peninsula which could be sealed off 
but that scheme too was scrapped because it would surely have 
raised charges by marcos supporters that the government was 
conducting the same secret trial for which the former president 
was condemned 
mrs aquino has said repeatedly that her government will 
eventually file charges against marcos the government has filed 39 
civil suits against marcos to recover 16 billion in damages but 
no trial dates have been set 
diaz told the associated press that in june military chief of 
staff gen renato de villa recommended no charges be filed until at 
least the first three months of 1989 to avoid risking political 
instability by a marcos return

gov roy romer on sunday denied a 
department of energy request to expand lowlevel radioactive waste 
storage at the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant 
romer made his decision as a railcar loaded with rocky flats 
wastes and turned back from a temporary storage site in idaho on 
order of idaho gov cecil d andrus was returning to the nuclear 
weapons plant 16 miles northwest of denver 
andrus has banned furthur shipments of such wastes to the 
storage site in his state 
i met with doe and they said would you expand the 
authorization to store at rocky flats and my answer was no 
romer said thats about as clear as you can get 
i also asked them not to unload that car but to leave it 
loaded and to leave it on the track so we can work to find another 
destination for it he said 
i said you an keep the authorization for storage you now 
have but i will not enlarge the storage 
an interim agreement allows storage of about 1600 cubic yards 
of material at rocky flats rocky flats has about 650 yards of 
lowlevel waste leaving about 950 cubic yards to go romer said 
the energy department had planned to transfer the waste from 
idaho to new mexico when the waste isolation pilot plant a 
permanent nuclear waste site near carlsbad nm opens that site 
was to have been in operation this month but the date has been 
pushed back at least until early next year 
romer said he did not want to authorize an increase in nuclear 
waste storage because he did not want colorado to be the escape

the air forces b1 bombers are grounded with 
maintenance problems far more than the aging planes they are 
supposed to replace says a congressional study 
the general accounting office study said the time that b1s 
werent available at dyess air force base in texas due to 
maintenance problems ranged from 47 percent to 66 percent 
for systems that have been flying longer such as the fb111 and 
the b52 the air force expects that the total of not mission 
capable rates wont exceed 25 percent of the available hours 
the air force responded to the figures by saying it wont have 
enough experience with the b1 until 1994 to consider the plane 
mature as the fb111 and b52 are now considered 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee disagreed when the gao suggested standards by which 
to judge the reasonableness of breakdowns they were told the plane 
isnt mature yet but its maturity is being pushed back further by 
breakdowns he said 
the gao study released sunday concludes that the b1b has 
not been mission capable because of maintenance a significant 
percentage of the time 
in air force parlance mission capable means the ability to 
carry out an assigned job in the case of the b1 which includes 
the first four prototype b1as which are no longer flying and the 
next generation of 100 b1bs that would mean a nuclear strike on 
the soviet union 
the air force says the b1b has been ready to go to war for 
two years but when it comes to pinning the service down on some of 
the planes problems the answer is the plane is still just a 
kid said aspin one of the planes chief critics 
in response capt jay defrank a spokesman for the air force 
said this weapon system is not fully mature so it is not valid 
to compare it to those that are he added that all but a few of 
the b1bs could be launched if a wartime crisis were to occur 
defrank also said the service wanted to fly the plane more but 
had been restricted by the democraticcontrolled congress 
in fiscal year 1988 congress specifically cut the b1 flying 
hours by 30 percent defrank said the air force flew all 
19000 flying hours allotted and could have flown more if they had 
been available 
the b1 program killed by president carter 11 years ago after 
the first four planes were built was resurrected in 1981 by 
president reagan who said 100 of the swingwing planes were needed 
as replacement for the aging b52s in americas fleet of atomic 
bombers reagan pledged that all 100 planes would be purchased by 
1988 at a cost of 26 billion 
the 100th plane was delivered last spring but aspin and other 
critics have pointed out what they say are serious flaws in the 
planes electronic countermeasure system the complex mix of 
computers and other weapons designed to outwit soviet defenses 
the air force defends the plane as the worlds most 
sophisticated atomic bomber and says the countermeasure problem can 
be fixed 
part of the planes problem according to the gao is that the 
maintenance system depends in part on an onboard diagnostic 
system that has not worked as designed that has delayed air force 
plans to have service personnel take over some maintenance jobs 
from private contractors 
the air force is also working on a better groundbased system to 
figure out b1 problems but that program wont be ready until at 
least next year the gao said

perhaps no politician has more riding on michael 
dukakis white house hopes than evelyn murphy 
the massachusetts lieutenant governor would take over the corner 
office here if dukakis moves to the oval office in washington 
murphys political career has been inextricably linked to the 
fortunes of dukakis beginning as a volunteer cutting newspaper 
clippings for his first gubernatorial campaign 
after weathering and riding that association for 14 years the 
48yearold lieutenant governor now says she would enjoy taking 
over if dukakis wins the white house in november 
sure she said you dont sit here twice around as a 
cabinet secretary and as a lieutenant governor and you dont run 
for the lieutenant governors office unless you look at it and 
think some day that it will be possible to get there 
for murphy who has always pointed to her business academic and 
later governmental credentials for her next job there appears to 
be a persistent problem with the way her motives intentions or 
actions have been interpreted in massachusetts charged political 
atmosphere particularly in relation to dukakis 
talking to reporters in july in atlanta when dukakis claimed the 
democratic partys presidential nomination she mentioned she was 
leaving the convention one day early the day dukakis gave his 
acceptance speech to pick up the pieces back in massachusetts 
it wasnt offhanded she said later of the remark but it 
got sort of stretched out to a kind of inference about the budget 
and an uncertain revenue situation she could inherit from dukakis 
murphy had virtually no political experience before business 
acquaintance howard smith later to become economic affairs 
secretary in dukakis first administration asked her to help out 
with dukakis first gubernatorial campaign 
it was literally no more than cutting newspaper articles 
she recalled but it got her recognized and remembered after 
dukakis won in 1974 
murphy helping dukakis fulfill a campaign promise of bringing 
women into his new administration joined his cabinet as 
environmental affairs secretary even though she thought her 
qualifications were better suited for secretary of economic affairs 
murphy holds a doctorate in economics from duke university and 
founded her own consulting firm specializing in education health 
care and municipal development 
but when dukakis was turned out of office by edward king in 
1978 murphy was out of a job too she became a visiting lecturer 
on environmental issues at the kennedy institute of politics at 
harvard university a consultant to polaroid corp and the founder 
of a nonprofit corporation involved in hazardous waste issues 
then in 1982 she made her first run for lieutenant governor 
she won the state democratic convention endorsement but lost the 
primary to john kerry political detractors would later criticize 
her for remaining neutral in the dukakisking rematch that year 
but when dukakis won back the governors office he didnt hesitate 
to bring her back into his administration this time as economic 
affairs secretary 
murphy quit the cabinet in late 1985 to run again for lieutenant 
governor this time she won the election but along the way 
suffered what she considers her most painful political defeat 
narrowly losing the democratic convention endorsement to former 
state sen gerard damico 
various factors have been given for the loss organized labor 
worked against her damico was helped by his former senate 
colleagues murphys initial campaign tactic emphasizing history 
that she was bidding to become the first woman to hold statewide 
office in massachusetts over her personal qualifications was 
illconceived 
but the final straw for many dukakis supporters may have been a 
boston herald column the day before the convention under a 
headline of question of loyalty the column quoted unnamed 
members of former gov kings transition team as saying she asked 
king if she could participate in his administration after king 
defeated dukakis in 1978 
murphy said the allegation which continues to haunt her is 
one thats always made me furious because its basically wrong 
murphy is unmarried lives in brookline like dukakis and is 
known for the long hours she gives to her work 
as a kid i was very shy growing up said murphy i got 
through that by achieving

the buckley family a leading voice of 
conservatives nationwide has moved beyond rhetoric in its 
longstanding feud with fellow connecticut republican lowell p 
weicker jr 
the buckleys who drew a few laughs at the republican national 
convention this summer in new orleans when they announced their 
endorsement of democrat joseph lieberman in the race for weickers 
senate seat have launched a political action committee and raised 
nearly 4000 to help lieberman federal records show 
a report filed last week with the federal election commission by 
buckpac the newly created fundraising arm of buckleys for 
lieberman reported 373750 in campaign contributions 
priscilla l buckley of sharon conn the committee treasurer 
and sister of national review editor william f buckley jr and 
former sen james buckley said 1000 has gone to lieberman and 
another 200 was split up among four republican congressional 
candidates in connecticut 
the family plans on spending the remaining 2500 on local 
newspaper ads attacking weicker she said 
buckley said the family did not solicit contributions but said 
small donations were received from people around the country who 
have been offended by lowell weicker 
she said contributions have slowed to a trickle adding that the 
family expected to receive about 1000 and were rather 
astonished to get three times that amount 
the feud between weicker a leader of the liberal wing of the 
party and the buckleys who represent the conservative branch of 
the gop began long before the 1988 senate race 
the buckleys accuse weicker of being a farout liberal who 
should not be a republican 
weicker counters that the buckleys represent an 
ultraconservative extremism that is dangerous to the gop 
the conservatives of that ilk dont want a republican party 
with a broad base weicker said in an interview earlier this 
month they want a narrow party such as their conservative party 
they obviously look at lowell weicker as frustrating that end 
and believe me they get out there and do their hatchet job as best 
they can because they dont care about the republican party 
weicker said they care about their ultraconservative 
principles be damned with the party 
weicker points to the 1970 senate race in new york in which 
james buckley defeated the republican nominee in a threeway race 
with 39 percent buckley lost a reelection bid in 1976 to democrat 
daniel patrick moynihan and four years later lost a senate bid in 
connecticut against democrat christopher j dodd 
in 1985 weicker and dodd opposed his nomination as a federal 
appeals court judge but buckley won senate confirmation 
weicker has often been the subject of criticism in william 
buckleys national review 
lieberman spokesman marla romash said anybody who knows joe 
lieberman realizes that the buckleys specifically william 
buckley raised money for the democrat not because he likes joe 
lieberman but because he hates lowell weicker 
priscilla buckley in a telephone interview friday said rep 
john g rowland rconn one of the four gop congressional 
candidates to receive 50 each from buckpac returned his 
contribution 
rowland whom many expected to challenge weicker in a primary 
but decided against it returned the money because he didnt feel 
he should take it from a fund that was against a republican she 
acknowledged

the death of a black teenager on a staten 
island street has forced residents of a workingclass neighborhood 
in new yorks whitest borough to proclaim they are not racists 
when derrick antonio tyus 17 was killed by a car shortly after 
a racial encounter with whites new yorkers recalled their most 
infamous racial incident of recent years the death of a black man 
who was run over as he fled a gang of whites in howard beach a 
neighborhood in the borough of queens 
police indicated tyus death oct 7 was not directly caused by a 
racist incident according to staten islands borough president 
who said the investigation found that tyus was hit by a car 20 
minutes after the exchange of racial slurs when he accidentally 
jumped in the street while horsing around with friends 
that explanation has not satisfied everyone state sen david a 
paterson has called for a special prosecutor to investigate 
at the urging of paterson and other civil rights leaders us 
attorney andrew maloney agreed last week to conduct a preliminary 
investigation into the death the fbi will gather information to 
determine whether a grand jury investigation into possible civil 
rights violations is warranted 
meanwhile residents and political leaders rushed to defend 
staten island and the neighborhood of rosebank from comparisons to 
howard beach 
we are not unique from any other community throughout this 
country said staten island borough president ralph lamberti 
do we have racial problems the answer is yes 
but that should not characterize our borough as a racist 
borough he said 
the blacks involved in the incident come from the park hill 
housing projects a nondescript row of brick buildings about a mile 
from rosebank and its narrow streets of neat houses 
tyus and nine other youths were walking past jjs bar and grill 
when a smaller group of young whites came outside and the two 
groups exchanged racial slurs police said 
the blacks told police that several white men got into two cars 
and followed them for several blocks at one point a white man 
allegedly jumped out of a car and pushed an 11yearold black to 
the ground they then fled in their cars 
police reportedly said some of those who were with tyus have 
changed their accounts several times 
there were some verbal slurs that were made lamberti said 
after a closeddoor briefing from police but there was no 
incident at least supported by the police department 
investigation where youngsters were chased through the streets 
because of fear of physical harm and ran into an oncoming car that 
is not the case here 
to make the parallel to the howard beach case is totally 
unfair to this community he said 
even so racial incidents are not new to staten island which 
has the smallest minority population among the citys five 
boroughs of an estimated 420000 residents about 52000 are 
members of minority groups most of them living on the islands 
north shore near the terminal for the staten island ferry 
last summer a black man on his way home from work was chased by 
a group of batwielding whites but escaped serious injury when 
several whites from a pizzeria came to his aid 
several years ago a black youth was beaten to death with a bat 
at a playground by a group of white youths because he was dating a 
white girl and a white was fatally stabbed for no apparent reason 
by blacks at a playground behind a black church 
but some leaders said rosebank is less racially polarized than 
many staten island neighborhoods 
i keep hearing that rosebank is a racist community to that i 
say nonsense said the rev john servodidio of st josephs 
church whose parish is a block from where tyus was killed 
after the accident people from the community rushed outside 
and placed a coat beneath the dying boys head and covered him 
until the ambulance came he said people in the crowd also 
suggested the quickest way to get to a hospital he said 
does that sound like a racist community 
servodidio believes something positive can come out of the 
incident 
its an opportunity for us to teach he said which he 
boldly did from the pulpit last week when he told his congregation 
he knew who the hypocrites and racists were among them and he 
would pray for their conversion 
the people i was referring to their heads went down the 
priest said

mario tapia an associated press photographer 
was in the nicaraguan town of bluefields when hurricane joan hit on 
saturday this is his story 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
you closed your eyes and then you 
opened them again and the city was gone 
bluefields had been observing its 85th birthday and despite the 
hurricane warnings the bars in this caribbean coastal city were 
still full friday afternoon 
few believed how bad it would be even after president daniel 
ortega flew in and toured all the neighborhoods telling people to 
leave 
in the evening the clouds got very thick but the air was still 
and the bay was calm 
the wind came up around 9 pm then came the rain people began 
to leave the low ground near the bay and take refuge in the hotel 
caribe a solid concrete building where i was staying with several 
other journalists and a very good cook 
we had him make us a big meal of lobster and shrimp because we 
thought we might not get much to eat for awhile someone asked for 
wine but there wasnt any 
as the wind rose we didnt want to open the doors of the hotel 
because the wind was so strong we had trouble closing them again 
we took paintings off the walls tore them apart and nailed the 
wood from the frames over the windows 
the refugees stayed calm except for a few children who were 
frightened by the sound of debris hitting the walls and the 
deafening whistle of the wind 
we peered out small windows and keyholes we saw whole zinc 
roofs being tossed off houses and sent clattering down the street 
trees were being ripped apart electric wires were falling 
a cuban weather technician told me that at 3 am saturday at 
the height of the storm the wind gusts hit 145 mph 
after dawn the storm began to ease people began to emerge and 
look around every street was filled with debris every building 
was damaged only a few still had their roofs there were all kinds 
of small dead animals around parrots bats huge rats dogs 
people were just dazed running around going nowhere 
authorities told us there were just 21 dead in the area i couldnt 
believe anybody had survived its a city of 38000 i dont know 
where everybody was hiding 
there were people who had been cut had taken blows one 
17yearold boy had a deep head wound at an openair hospital 
cuban doctors were stitching people up without anesthetic 
the moravian church was crushed it looked like a giant had put 
his foot on it at the market near the docks there were boats 
inside the houses a statue in the city park was decapitated 
the city may have been saved from hurricane joan by its bay 
which protected it from the huge waves and tremendous storm surge 
that is usually the most serious killer in hurricanes 
people shared their food they were very generous there was a 
short period of plenty because all the refrigerators had lost 
power so they wanted to eat right away 
i saw some men carrying a cows hindquarters through the 
streets other people ate downed coconuts in a wrecked seminary a 
man guarded his flock of wet chickens 
people began to make juryrigged roofs out of pieces of zinc in 
the center of town where most stores are owned by chinese 
immigrants the merchants were trying to shelter their remaining 
goods 
prison inmates may have suffered least because the jail was 
solid but then they were taken out with soldiers guarding them 
to work on clearing the road to the airport 
there was no way to get out of town theres no road west 
through the jungle and the airport was closed the only 
communication was by government radio 
the airport finally opened after noon sunday after we took off 
to fly to managua the pilot gave us an aerial tour not one tree 
in bluefields had any leaves the palm trees looked like spikes 
in the park that had been so gay during the anniversary 
celebration the trees looked like skeletons the city practically 
died on its 85th birthday 
then we flew over the port of el bluff on the other side of the 
bay it had been flattened it looked like a bulldozer had scraped 
the earth 
i lived through the earthquake that killed 10000 people in 
managua in 1972 it was deadly but it left houses still standing 
and the leaves on the trees but in bluefields nothing was left 
neither the leaves nor the houses 
how do i feel good because im alive

an insider trading scandal is revealing plenty of 
intrigue top politicians aides buy stock a hidden camera 
captures an apparent attempt to bribe a lawmaker and a key man 
says he would rather die than talk 
the politically sensitive recruit scandal is named after the 
recruit co a highflying conglomerate whose offices in tokyos 
glittering ginza district were raided wednesday 
the raid filmed for television as prosecutors carted away about 
1500 boxes of confiscated documents was followed by the first 
arrest since the scandal went national in july 
hiroshi matsubara 47 a former top aide to the head of 
recruitcosmos co a realestate subsidiary was charged thursday 
with offering a bribe to yonosuke narazaki member of parliament 
for the opposition united socialist democratic party narazaki is a 
persistent driver of parliaments probe of the scandal 
with that arrest the probe is moving on two fronts with 
investigations by prosecutors and the diet japans parliament 
backed by aggressive reporting from some news media 
at long last the scandal has come under criminal 
investigation at least in part the asahi shimbun which made 
the first revelations of the scandals political bearing in june 
said in an editorial 
but the liberalleaning newspaper while praising the display of 
independence by the tokyo district prosecutors office expressed 
worry that the criminal investigation could give some diet 
members a perfect excuse for calling for a slowdown in the diet 
probe 
the alleged bribe was a flagrant example of the socalled 
money politics that underlie the recruit scandal with 
reverberations to the top of japanese politics and in the stock 
market as well 
a camera hidden by nippon television network with narazakis 
permission showed matsubara asking the opposition parliamentarian 
to help save the recruit company and offering an envelope full of 
cash saying we intend to support you for the rest of your 
political career 
narazaki said matsubara who resigned his recruit position as 
soon as the video was shown on national television sept 6 visited 
him three times offering 38000 
matsubaras former boss hiromasa ezoe has been hospitalized 
reportedly suffering from depression but on oct 12 several 
members of the diet questioned him about recruits having sold 
shares in recruitcosmos at bargain prices to top political aides 
before the company went public in 1986 
the shares leaped in value when open trading began yielding fat 
profits and it is widely assumed the money went to finance 
political activities of the governing liberal democratic party 
the lawmakers quoted ezoe who founded the parent company 
recruit as having told them he was sorry for having caused trouble 
to people whose names had been revealed as having benefited 
i cannot bear to see any more people resign or be 
inconvenienced i would rather kill myself than disclose their 
names ezoe was quoted as saying from his hospital bed 
nonetheless the plots next unfolding revealed the biggest name 
so far on the list of recruitcosmos beneficiaries that of 
finance minister kiichi miyazawa previously it was said an aide to 
miyazawa bought recruitcosmos shares 
the finance minister also deputy premier denied purchasing the 
shares himself and apologized for being lax in supervising an aide 
who he said let a third party use miyazawas name to buy the shares 
still to be heard from are all the political aides who are said 
to have actually held and sold the recruitcosmos shares 
until friday news reports said 76 people received shares but 
the asahi shimbun quoted informed sources as saying ezoe sold 
shares to 140 people 
no authoritative complete list has been made public yet but the 
politicians who have confirmed their aides held shares include 
prime minister noboru takeshita former prime minister yasuhiro 
nakasone and former foreign minister shintaro abe now secretary 
general of the ruling liberal democrats 
all have denied personal wrongdoing the transactions were not 
illegal but the scandal called sharp attention to political ethics 
and intimate links between business and politics 
the opposition and ruling parties all need money to run election 
campaigns constituency affairs and parliamentary activities and 
big business has always been a major source of cash in japans 
rapidly expanding economy new companies like recruitcosmos have 
become a source of political money through the device of selling 
shares at bargain prices before they go public 
but never before has the practice made so many headlines or 
administered such a jolt 
the opposition japan socialist party demanded miyazawas 
resignation but the finance minister has refused takeshita who 
needs miyazawa to quarterback a taxreform package through the 
diet has said miyazawa bears an ethical responsibility but 
resignation was not called for

nearly 500 years after copernicus postulated that 
earth revolves around the sun millions of americans think 
otherwise suggests a poll that found vast numbers of the nations 
adults scientifically illiterate 
many americans also mistakenly believe that laser beams are 
focused sound waves and that atoms are smaller than electrons said 
jon miller director of the public opinion laboratory at northern 
illinois university who conducted a nationwide survey for the 
national science foundation 
in a july telephone survey 2041 adults 18 or older were asked 
about 75 questions on basic science miller said the survey had a 
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points 
asked whether the earth goes around the sun or the sun around 
the earth 21 percent replied incorrectly seven percent said they 
didnt know 
in the early 16th century the polish astronomer nicholas 
copernicus laid the foundation for modern astronomy with his 
heliocentric theory of planetary motion in which the planets 
revolved around a motionless sun 
fortyfive percent correctly said it takes a year for the earth 
to orbit the sun but 17 percent said one day 2 percent said one 
month and 9 percent didnt know 
the results show that on very basic ideas vast numbers of 
americans are scientifically illiterate miller said sunday 
its a fairly dire situation 
the results of the survey havent been fully tabulated yet but 
it appears that 93 percent to 95 percent would have to be 
considered scientifically illiterate lacking fundamental knowledge 
of scientific vocabulary methodology and an understanding of 
sciences impact on the world said miller the groups 1985 survey 
found a 95 percent illiteracy rate 
the results indicate many americans have little idea of what 
presidential candidates are talking about when they list key issues 
such as the strategic defense initiative acid rain the greenhouse 
effect and the space race he said 
leon lederman who last week was named cowinner of the 1988 
nobel prize for physics and is director of the fermi national 
accelerator laboratory in batavia called the latest findings 
pretty devastating 
how you can preserve democracy when the world is increasingly 
more complex scientifically and technologically and people are 
increasingly more ignorant of the issues he asked 
on other questions the survey found that 43 percent said 
correctly that electrons which are components of atoms are 
smaller than atoms 20 percent thought they were larger and 37 
percent had no idea 
asked if lasers an essential component of the proposed star 
wars defense system work by focusing sound waves 36 percent 
correctly answered the statement was false twentynine percent 
thought it was true and 35 percent didnt know lasers work by 
focusing light waves in fact the name stands for light 
amplification by stimulated emission of radiation 
most of those surveyed 76 percent answered correctly that 
light travels faster than sound nineteen percent mistakenly 
thought sound moves faster 
miller said some of the responses indicate the lack of 
scientific knowledge could present some practical problems 
for example 63 percent said incorrectly that antibiotics kill 
viruses as well as bacteria 
so if a doctor tells a patient he has a virus and the patient 
has an antibiotic around the house hes liable to take it said 
miller antibiotics dont kill viruses 
miller said the great majority of high school graduates have not 
had a days instruction in algebra physics or chemistry 
its important to turn that around he said

plans for a 50 millionamonth heroin pipeline 
from mexico were foiled with the arrest of two mexican police 
commanders who officials say boasted they could close airports in 
their home state to help the smuggling 
pedro guillen 39 and margaritan villagrana 42 commanders 
from the state of guerrero which includes acapulco were to be 
arraigned today authorities said they were arrested late saturday 
in a hotel following a fourmonth investigation said robert 
strang a spokesman for the us drug enforcement adminstration 
they had the arrogance to travel to the united states to 
peddle their goods said robert m stutman special agent in 
charge of the dea in new york 
whenever you have police officials involved in the trafficking 
of major amounts of drugs it is truly the worst betrayal of the 
public trust to have foreign police officers come to the united 
states to traffic in drugs is even worse 
the suspects agreed to supply 50 kilograms or 110 pounds of 
heroin manufactured in mexico each month strang said sunday a 
kilogram of heroin has a street value of up to 1 million 
mexican heroin is not something we normally have available to 
us here in new york because virtually all the heroin smuggled 
into the city comes from asia said strang 
these two defendants were using their positions in the 
acapulco region of mexico to safely transport the heroin to the 
united states strang said 
us agents posing as drug traffickers spoke with the men in 
mexico by telephone and the pair flew here friday to complete the 
deal strang said 
after dining with the mexicans on saturday night two undercover 
agents went to the mens hotel and gave them 15000 as partial 
payment he said 
a surveillance team then moved in and made the arrests strang 
said 
the two were charged with conspiracy to distribute heroin a 
felony that carries a penalty of 25 years to life in prison he 
said 
the mexican officers bragged to the undercover agents in 
taperecorded conversations that they could close down airports in 
their home region if a plane from new york flew in to pick up the 
heroin strang said 
the reagan administration has charged that drug enforcement 
agencies in mexico are filled with corruption earlier this year 
nine people including three mexican police officials were 
indicted in los angeles in connection with the torture and murder 
of us dea agent enrique camarena in mexico three including a 
former homicide investigator in guadalajara mexico have been 
convicted

in a preelection faceoff foreign minister 
shimon peres claimed progress in his peace efforts but prime 
minister yitzhak shamir accused his rival of seeking arab support 
sundays 30minute prerecorded debate on national television 
gave the public its only chance to see the two party leaders go at 
each other facetoface before the nov 1 parliamentary elections 
peres head of the leftist labor party seemed to benefit from 
the endorsement of his approach to peace talks by jordans king 
hussein 
it put shamir leader of the rightwing likud bloc on the 
defensive and provided the missing ingredient to peres peace 
proposals a possible partner 
shamir dressed in a black suit and blackdotted lavender tie 
claimed peres was out of bounds in arranging for hussein to endorse 
labors peace strategy in a us television interview last week 
i must say that to involve an arab ruler in israels election 
campaign is crass interference it is unprecedented said shamir 
the people have to reject this unequivocally 
peres also dressed in a dark suit and speaking directly to the 
camera responded is it a sin or an accomplishment to enlist an 
arab country in the cause of peace i wish we could enlist all 
countries in the cause of peace said peres 
peres his voice often turning angry vowed to get out of this 
terrible circle of war and to enter into negotiations to begin 
negotiations immediately after elections 
shamir also pledged to seek talks with the arabs but was 
critical of king hussein alluding to the jordanian leaders 
meeting over the weekend with palestine liberation organization 
chairman yasser arafat 
hussein supports arafat and the plo today he said is 
this an opportunity is this the way to peace just the oppposite 
hussein arafat and president hosni mubarak of egypt met in the 
jordanian port of aqaba on saturday and reportedly tried to work 
out common ground for an international peace conference 
shamir speaking confidently with thrusting gestures suggested 
he would take a realistic if more difficult road to negotiations 
with the arabs 
he pledged not to surrender to the arabs but seek peace 
based on autonomy for the 15 million palestinians in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip even though this has been 
rejected by the arabs he called for the resumption of autonomy 
talks with egypt which cairo broke off in 1981 after failing to 
win palestinian support 
peres called for an international conference to talk peace but 
shamir said the arabs would talk directly to israel without foreign 
interference if there was no other option 
there will be no international conference and they the 
arabs will therefore have no alternative but to enter direct 
negotiations shamir said 
peres sought to portray shamir as unbending and intransigent 
blocking all moves towards peace during the four years of the 
national unity government which united the two major political 
blocs after the stalemated 1984 elections 
mr shamir is a consistent individual in my opinion 
occasionally stubborn said peres who then seemed to suggest 
that shamirs inflexibility stemmed from his advanced age 73 
peres noted that he was 65 
peace talks dominated the opening half of the debate but 
economic and social issues also played a major role on these 
peres appeared more evasive and shamir promised to lower taxes a 
move opposed by labor 
aides for both sides claimed victory but neither expected it to 
have a dramatic impact on the undecided voters whom analysts say 
account for about 8 percent of the 29 million eligible voters 
one reason is that after four years of public bickering over the 
peace issue israeli voters are wellversed in the approaches of 
the two leaders

the dollar inched up against the japanese yen today 
while share prices on the tokyo stock exchange dipped slightly 
after opening at 12617 yen its lowest level since june 21 the 
dollar rose apparently because dealers were concerned the bank of 
japan might intervene to prop up the dollar 
the currency peaked 12675 yen shortly before closing at 12660 
yen up 020 yen from fridays close of 12640 yen 
exchange dealers attributed the low opening rate to the markets 
skepticism over the ability of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries to reach agreement on production quotas among 
members of the oil cartel 
but the general perception of the market was the bank of japan 
will likely intervene if the dollar declined to the 125yen 
level said a currency dealer in tokyo speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
on the tokyo stock exchange the nikkei stock average of 225 
selected issues which gained 32 points last week lost 5703 
points or 021 percent from saturdays close it ended the day at 
2728154 
stock dealers said the initial fall in the dollar today hurt 
share prices 
when there is a wild fluctuation in the foreign exchange 
rates investors are not enthused about participating in the stock 
market said a dealer at a major securities firm in tokyo also 
speaking anonymously 
exportoriented shares including electronic and automobile 
issues lost ground 
dealers added that emperor hirohitos continuing illness was 
also having a negative impact on the stock market 
volume traded on the first section of the exchange where most 
major stocks are listed was a thin 600 million shares

saturdays blaze at the shanghai gaoqiao oil chemistry corps 
refinery occurred when liquefied gas leaked after a worker 
opened a water drain valve the citys liberation daily newspaper 
said in its sunday editions 
the englishlanguage china daily said the fire was the worst in 
chinas largest city since the communists came to power in 1949 
shanghai police say they did not know kind of gas caught fire 
and called it only liquified gas but editors at the china 
daily said when queried that they believed it to be liquified 
natural gas 
a guard reported the leak about midnight friday but nobody paid 
attention the reports said an hour later the gas was ignited by 
sparks from a nearby construction workers shed touching off a 
fire that quickly spread back to the refinery they said

hospitals three of the remaining survivors were in critical 
condition and doctors expected the death toll to rise china daily 
said 
the newspaper identified one of the injured as the refinery 
janitor whose attempt to report the fire failed because the 
telephone was not working 
an official in shanghai reached by telephone today said there 
was no change in the number of casualties

a social worker who is a choctaw 
indian has fought for four years to protect eight weedy acres he 
believes are a desecrated indian burial ground 
you want to cry you just want to cry mel fletcher said 
recently you can feel the spirit when you go there 
ill tell you exactly what one of our medicine men felt 
said fletcher mad bear dropped to the ground with his hands to 
the sky 
since 1984 the social worker at akrons north american indian 
center has fought to protect the plot known as south park which 
has been threatened as a potential source of cover soil for an 
adjacent landfill pit 
the site has been ravaged over the years mostly by amateur 
archaeologists hunting artifacts from centuries ago when indian 
tribes lived on the bluff above the cuyahoga river 
david s brose curator of archaeology at the cleveland museum 
of natural history said he was unsure whether the site was a 
burial ground or an indian village 
the last museum research in the area was halted in 1981 partly 
due to careless looting of what partially disturbed deposits 
still existed said a report by brose 
the area has been dug up in places by amateurs and 
professionals said north american indian center director clark 
hosick there are still a number of remains there its kind of 
overgrown now or you would be able to see remains strewn about on 
the ground 
only about 25 percent of the original site remains hosick said 
the rest was destroyed when the 19acre 300footdeep landfill pit 
was excavated 
its a site we want to see protected its gone far enough 
and it doesnt need to be disturbed anymore said hosick 
ohio environmental protection agency director richard l shank 
is expected to decide the merits of an application for a landfill 
permit by landfill owner boyas excavation co 
fletcher a 60yearold member of the choctaw tribe native to 
oklahoma and mississippi has lived in northeast ohio since 1949 
he didnt find out about the site until 1984 when he read a 
newspaper column describing how it had been torn up by amateurs 
seeking indian mementos 
with no public announcement fletcher and about a dozen other 
indians broke through a gate at the site and set up a traditional 
indian camp for a weekend 
when you get a bunch of young folks involved its pretty hard 
to control them fletcher recalled especially natives because 
theyre so moved by this it makes them angry inside we wanted to 
keep the public sentiment with us we were told we would be 
arrested but that really didnt materialize 
fletcher returns to the site once or twice a week on one recent 
visit he pointed to new shallow pits left by what he called 
grave robbers 
but recent events have encouraged him to believe the site will 
soon belong to indians again 
state sen grace drake has introduced legislation that would 
forbid creation of a landfill in any public park south park is 
adjacent to the cuyahoga valley national recreation area 
at his home fletcher keeps bones he found at the site in 1984 
which he believes are those of a young indian woman he said he 
will return the bones to the ground only when indians again control 
it 
you cant separate the bones from the spirit fletcher said

a us commission looking to close 
obsolete military bases may be about to play taps for fort douglas 
and politicians say they may be ready to surrender the post built 
in 1862 to protect stagecoach routes 
members of utahs congressional delegation consider the 
picturesque fort and its civil warera buildings a likely target in 
the pentagons quest to shut about two dozen bases 
they say theyll have to acquiesce if it can be shown that the 
move would save money but some are skeptical that any real savings 
can be had 
our main concern is that they operate from uptodate 
accurate data said democratic rep wayne owens whose district 
includes the fort 
if the data is accurate and theres no indication of 
unfairness then i dont know what i can do you cant be for 
closing down everybody elses things and not be willing to look at 
your own 
congress this month approved legislation that calls for a 
pentagonappointed panel to recommend by dec 31 a list of bases to 
be closed defense secretary frank c carlucci would have until 
jan 15 five days before leaving office to accept or reject the 
entire list the law aims to save up to 5 billion a year 
fort douglas is among a small group of bases that critics have 
long contended contributes little to the nations defense 
built in 1862 in foothills between salt lake city and the 
wasatch mountains the fort was named at president lincolns 
suggestion after his illinois rival sen stephen a douglas who 
died the year before 
ostensibly built to protect stagecoach routes from indian 
attacks the forts first commander col patrick conner 
acknowledged that he chose the foothills overlooking the city so he 
could keep an eye on brigham youngs mormon pioneers he said they 
were too friendly with the indians 
at one point conner sought to have mormon merchants sign a 
loyalty oath to the united states before allowing them to sell 
goods to the fort 
in this century the post housed prisonerofwar camps in both 
world wars 
politicians may be more willing to accept the closure now 
because the move probably would cost only a fraction of the 414 
civilian jobs at the post and the university of utah is eager to 
absorb 112 buildings should the army declare them surplus 
officials say 
nevertheless owens who suggested the fort be closed two years 
ago later decided after a visit it would be cheaper to maintain 
a 1981 congressional study requested by sen jake garn rutah 
after the army announced plans to close the fort reached the same 
conclusion it said that although the army would save money by 
closing the post heavy use by military reserve groups made fort 
douglas cost effective overall 
garn said that conclusion still may be valid and he said he 
would seek another independent study if the commission recommends 
closure 
fort douglas is home to 3300 utah reservists from the army 
navy and marine corps as well as headquarters for the 96th army 
reserve command that oversees about 24000 reservists in seven 
western states 
the fort also houses the office that disburse paychecks to 
reservists in 14 states recruiting commands for the four services 
and a military examination center 
in contrast the forts headquarters command consists of only 
five active duty military and 62 civilian personnel 
if the fort were closed the reserve units would remain and 
continue to require activeduty support said post commander col 
fred hillyard 
fort douglas accomplishes that in a very costeffective manner 
and to do it another way might prove more costly he said 
the forts tenants pay only 2 a square foot for space and they 
would almost certainly pay more anywhere else in the salt lake city 
area said maj bill auer an army reserves public relations 
officer 
jim abbee spokesman for the commission on base realignment and 
closure that is studying military bases said the panel will look 
at reserve activities when it reviews fort douglas but he said 
there is no list of closure targets yet and one of the 12 
commission members still must be appointed 
its a blank piece of paper at the moment abbee said

the reagan administration smarting from its 
long and tragic involvement in lebanon is treading softly through 
the maze of lebanese politics with a nervous eye on the countrys 
creeping partition 
us diplomacy is essentially in a holding pattern designed to 
prevent lebanons disintegration at least until the next us 
administration takes over and decides whether to continue american 
involvement or to pull out 
we want to do nothing that will nudge that country into 
partition said richard murphy the assistant secretary of state 
who has dealt with lebanon in recent years 
murphys latest gambit was a shuttle to lebanon in september to 
try to work out a list of presidential candidates acceptable to the 
christians who have traditionally run the country the moslems who 
constitute its majority and to syria which controls large parts of 
lebanon 
murphy couldnt get syria to budge from its support of 
mikhail daher whom the main christian group rejected said an 
official who accompanied murphy to damascus he spoke on condition 
he not be named 
us officials now concede their initial support of daher was 
wrong because it antagonized lebanons christians and in effect 
prevented elections from being held 
instead tiny lebanon has two governments one led by maronite 
christian gen michel aoun and the other by moslem acting prime 
minister salim hoss 
aouns appointment on sept 22 in the last minutes of the 
presidency of amin gemayel deepened a political schism that 
threatens to formalize the unofficial christianmoslem partition 
created by lebanons 1975 civil war 
because of the fragmentation us officials are now dealing 
with all sides there isnt a leader in lebanon were not dealing 
with murphy said in congressional testimony 
but that course is also fraught with problems both christians 
and moslems last week accused us ambassador john mccarthy of 
interfering in lebanons affairs although both sides had earlier 
urged us involvement to help resolve the crisis 
the reagan administration first became enmeshed in lebanon in 
1982 when the united states sent in the marines to oversee the 
pullout of palestinian guerrillas and invading israeli troops from 
beirut a suicide car bomber in 1983 killed 241 marines leading to 
the end of the american military presence 
but secretary of state george shultz was determined he 
orchestrated negotiations between israel and lebanon for a peace 
agreement in 1983 only to have the rug pulled from under him by 
gemayels abdication of the agreement soon after it was signed 
shultz was disgusted and for a long time he refused to touch 
lebanon said yahya sadowski an authority on lebanon at the 
brookings institution an independent think tank 
the handsoff policy remained in place until late last year 
when murphy sought permission to try again this time the united 
states wanted to serve as postman between syrian president hafez 
assad and gemayel who werent talking to each other 
the object of the exchange was to agree on constitutional 
reforms in lebanon that would grant the moslem majority more power 
and would facilitate the september elections but that effort also 
failed with the sides failing to agree on a powersharing formula 
with the failure of efforts to find a consensus candidate in 
september they really lost what enthusiasm they had left said 
sadowski 
why not give up 
were doing a lot less than we used to concedes a state 
department official who makes daily policy on lebanon the united 
states is no longer trying to build up the lebanese army its aid 
programs are down to less than 1 million and it has washed its 
hands of attempts to negotiate constitutional reform between the 
parties he said 
but were not pulling out well remain engaged until the last 
minute the official added 
the american ambassador and his staff in beirut are still 
meeting with the factions to try to fashion a short list of 
candidates so that elections can be held he said 
our involvement is one of the few things that helps maintain 
the calm the official said 
us officials contend that partition would be damaging to 
american interests by further destabilizing the region and giving 
free reign to drug traffickers and terrorists 
in recent weeks a new player has entered the lebanon equation 
further complicating matters iraq which until july was engaged in 
a costly war with iran gave the christian lebanese forces 5 
million and 68 tanks last month 
the odd alliance between moslem iraq and the christians is 
directed at the syriairan axis which dominates most of eastern 
lebanon and beirut and its environs israel rules a portion of the 
south 
the next washington administration inherits a sticky mess in 
lebanon it may decide on another approach but is quite likely to 
withdraw and let the lebanese sort things out themselves

at the inaugural conference of a 
lithuanian nationalist mass movement delegates endorsed greater 
autonomy after heated debate over whether their republic should 
demand the right to secede from the soviet union 
the conference in the republics capital ended sunday after 
20000 people sang nationalist songs and shed tears of joy at a 
mass to celebrate the governments return of a 14thcentury 
cathedral to the roman catholic church 
the lithuanian movement for restructuring claiming 180000 
active supporters softened a draft resolution that said the 
republic reserves its right to withdraw from the soviet union 
by constitutionally acknowledged means 
the final version approved sunday by an overwhelming margin of 
the more than 1000 delegates was nearly a carbon copy of the 
communist partys position it said lithuanias relations with 
other soviet republics should be based on leninist principles of 
federalism national equality and selfdetermination 
the conference also approved measures calling for control of the 
republics economy establishment of diplomatic ties with foreign 
countries and freedom for lithianian political prisoners 
the twoday conference of the movement known in lithuanian as 
sajudis was the first since the group formed in june 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev is pressing for 
wideranging economic and political reforms but has warned against 
attempts by national groups to redraw the countrys boundaries 
secession is one of the most sensitive issues for lithuanians 
and their baltic neighbors the estonians and latvians 
the soviet union incorporated the three republics in 1940 under 
a secret pact with nazi germany and some groups in the region say 
the agreement should be renounced 
several speakers during the weekend conference received standing 
ovations for suggesting the group label the soviet takeover of 
lithuania an occupation 
tempers in the vilnius sports palace flared after one delegate 
rolandas paulauskas said lithuania should demand the right to 
secede from the 15republic soviet union some of the delegates 
heckled paulauskas 
the speech we just heard should be considered a provocation 
we have to be realistic said writer vytautas petkevisias a 
leader in the restructuring movement 
lithuanias reformminded communist party chief who sat through 
much of the debate and was warmly received at the conference 
advised caution 
some of the speeches from this fine stage saddened me or 
rather have raised a lot of thought said algirdas brazauskas he 
urged delegates to carefully consider the consequences of their 
demands and act in a rational businesslike way 
but brazauskas appointed the republics party leader just four 
days earlier to replace a conservative said lithuanias leaders 
would systematically evaluate and solve as many problems as 
possible the audience cheered 
the lithuanian government has agreed to several nationalist 
demands including declaring lithuanian the official language and 
lifting a ban on display of the flag that flew in lithuania during 
its independence between the two world wars 
the first mass in 30 years at the vilnius cathedral was 
conducted outdoors sunday to accommodate the worshipers who gave 
thanks both for the return of the cathedral and the rapid changes 
sweeping this baltic republic of 36 million people 
the vilnius cathedral was a center of christianity in the middle 
ages and its confiscation by the officially atheist soviet 
government had angered many lithuanians of whom nearly 2 million 
are catholics 
the government converted the cathedral into an art gallery in 
1950 and paintings line its walls instead of religious symbols 
in an indication of recent changes in lithuania police who once 
would have massed in threatening numbers around the crowd at 
sundays mass directed traffic instead lithuanian television 
broadcast the service live 
men women and children carried the oncebanned yellow green 
and red lithuanian flag and sang nationalist and religious hymns 
led by the first lithuanian cardinal of modern times vincentas 
sladkevicius the cardinal was appointed by the vatican five months 
ago

charles has been seeking the company of more serious types 
including some older married women like bona frescobaldi 47 an 
italian marchesa and dale tryon 40 who is married to one of the

hundreds of migrant workers who spent the 
summer living in tents near the nations capital are pulling up 
stakes as campground closings force them back to the high 
unemployment of their home states 
officials meanwhile hope to find housing alternatives before 
next summers anticipated crush of workers seeking the regions 
plentiful construction jobs but who cant afford its expensive 
housing rental units in fairfax county average 662 a month 
this problem is not going away said rep bob wise dwva 
who met this summer with west virginia constituents living in a 
northern virginia park 
i strongly feel that the problem has to be a shared 
responsibility with the private sector said verdia l haywood 
deputy executive for human services in fairfax county 
the migrants mostly from west virginia but also from ohio 
kentucky and texas spent the summer on the move because of a 
fairfax county rule that requires campers to vacate a campground 
for at least four days after a maximum sevenday stay 
linda nolan said she her boyfriend her 17yearold daughter 
and her 3yearold grandson moved 33 times in seven months to 
comply with the regulation 
they will move a 34th time back to west virginias hills 
when the burke lake park campground closes for winter next weekend 
she said she faces a winter of mostly unemployment or lowpaying 
jobs back home but at least her rent will be 100 a month 
fairfax vice chairwoman martha pennino said she wants the county 
to create a citizens shelter committee which would report back to 
the board of supervisors with a plan in three months she wants the 
business community involved in the committee and has proposed 
placing residential trailers at construction sites where many of 
the workers are employed 
she also proposed relaxing the sevenday camping limit which is 
aimed at discouraging people from living in the parks 
some help has materialized one builder offered reduced rent if 
migrant workers would help him renovate a house families also were 
adopted by churches said linda crouch a department of social 
services worker 
nolan 38 said she will miss her job at bettys azalea ranch 
and her 530anhour salary after she returns to burton wva she 
said she worked seven days a week as a laborer to get every penny 
i can 
shes had her fill of eating her meals on picnic tables but 
proud that doing so has enabled her to repay a bank loan 
we dont have that hanging on us now she said it was 
worth it

my music is my way of saying thank you to my family my 
friends and everyone who encouraged me during the time i was at st 
anthonys hospital and during the months of my recovery sell 
said in a written statement 
your thoughtfulness flowers cards and prayers meant so much 
to me words cannot convey how much i appreciated everything he 
added

still picketing

plans to meet sometime later this week the times said

the parents of a man killed by a 
hitandrun driver have offered a 1 million reward and appealed to 
a national television audience for information that might reveal 
the drivers identity 
mark baltes was struck by a white buick on an oceanside drive 
here and dragged 60 feet to his death more than 2 years ago 
attorney barry krischer says the driver approached him for 
counsel the day after the accident but he has won court permission 
to keep the name a secret on the grounds of attorneyclient 
confidentiality 
krischer again refused to identify the driver when interviewed 
on cbstvs 60 minutes broadcast sunday night 
a tearful mildred baltes also appeared on the show and said she 
was determined to find the driver so she can put her sons tragedy 
behind her 
mrs baltes and her exhusband joseph baltes say they must win 
a 6 million lawsuit against the driver before they can pay off any 
reward money 
that suit was filed in february over the march 9 1986 
accident it is pending in palm beach county circuit court while 
state and private investigators continue trying to track down the 
driver 
on oct 12 circuit judge timothy poulton said krischer did not 
have to reveal the drivers name because it is protected by 
attorneyclient privilege 
this criminal is out there laughing at the system hiding 
behind the attorneyclient privilege says joseph farish 
attorney for baltes family he devised the reward plan announced 
on friday in order to make incentive for someone to come forward 
and expedite this mystery 
farish conceded that if someone comes forward with information 
leading to the drivers identity the tipster would have to wait 
for a favorable jury verdict in the lawsuit 
richard lubin who represents krischer said he is indifferent 
to farishs tactics as long as farish does not trample on the 
judges ruling

a construction worker accused of plotting 
to have his mother killed with a rattlesnake borrowed 300 from her 
to pay the snake handler police said 
tipped off by a florida snake handler police arrested reginald 
pope on thursday in his 62yearold mothers alabama home pope is 
in the marengo ala county jail on a charge of conspiracy to 
commit murder 
he must have had this idea in his head for some time because 
he had all the details planned out said escambia county 
sheriffs cpl wendall hall 
authorities didnt identify the snake handler but said he told 
escambia sheriffs deputy ed hudson about the proposal after 
meeting pope at a pensacola restaurant more than a week ago 
they started talking and when pope found out that the man 
trapped rattlesnakes as a hobby he said well youre just the 
man ive been looking for hall said then pope told him he 
wanted to hire someone with a rattlesnake to kill his mother 
authorities said the snake handler went to alabama taking a 
snake with him in order to fool pope into thinking he was 
cooperating in the plot 
he wanted the rattlesnake to bite her on the neck at the 
jugular vein so the venom would go straight to the heart or the 
brain hall said 
the motive apparently was money pope was the sole beneficiary 
of her insurance policies and will hall said 
he even borrowed 300 from his mother to give to the 
rattlesnake handler after he saw the snake hall said 
alabama authorities got the mother out of the house and pope 
was arrested just before the snake was to be let loose when he 
walked into the house

for weeks it seemed all of poland was 
waiting for the round table now it has finally arrived 
a specially made table 29 feet in diameter has been delivered to 
the jablonna palace for the expected talks between representatives 
of authorities and the opposition a furniture maker said 
the talks could begin as early as this week 
the doughnutshaped table is hollow in the center and can seat 
more than 50 people said a polish media source it comprises 14 
sections is made of pine and is covered with a veneer the source 
said 
the manager of the warsaw factory of artistic furniture henryk 
lewandowski said the table took two weeks to manufacture and was 
delivered this morning to the government palace just outside 
warsaw he said he was not authorized to give further details 
interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak and solidarity leader 
lech walesa agreed at a meeting aug 31 to hold roundtable 
discussions that will cover broad social questions including 
solidaritys future and economic and political pluralism in poland 
both sides say they want the talks to begin as soon as possible 
and blame the other for delays 
the government saturday said it wants another meeting between 
kiszczak and walesa to remove lastminute obstacles to the talks 
including disputes over certain individuals nominated by the 
opposition to participate 
walesa says such a preparatory meeting is unnecessary because 
solidarity will not change its proposed delegation to the talks 
and any other technical matters can be cleared up through 
lowerlevel intermediaries

about 90 elementary school students who 
objected to an electronic monitor that buzzes and flashes when they 
get too loud in the lunchroom wont have to endure it if they stay 
reasonably quiet the schools principal says 
i think the light stinks said richmond school sixthgrader 
scott doyon its a big waste of money i think the aides do a 
good job of making us quiet 
he was among fifth and sixthgraders who submitted a 
handwritten petition last week asking that the monitor be removed 
the monitor is equipped with a noisemeasuring device that scans 
the lunchroom 
as many as 175 pack into one of four daily lunch shifts at the 
705student school principal pasquale nappi said 
with relative quiet the monitor is green if it gets louder 
the signal changes to yellow and the monitor emits a loud 
electronic beep more noise and the red light comes on and the 
monitor buzzes 
if the red light blinks on more than five times during a lunch 
shift the lights are switched off and the students eat in the dark 
additional red lights mean the students lose a 10minute recess 
period after lunch 
nappi bowing to the the fifth and sixthgraders protests has 
ruled that they wont have to eat under the monitors continuous 
scrutiny as long as they remain reasonably quiet 
but first through fourthgraders will remain under the 
monitors electronic supervision nappi said 
the richmond parentteacher organization bought the device in 
the spring for 450 it was installed in time for the first day of 
school last month 
the acquisition was a reaction to complaints from lunchroom 
aides that noise in the cafeteria which also serves as an 
auditorium and a gymnasium was intolerable at times

west german chancellor helmut kohl seeking 
improved economic relations with the soviets met today with 
mikhail s gorbachev for their first formal talks since gorbachev 
became soviet leader 
kohl who arrived in moscow today for a fourday official visit 
was greeted at vnukovo airport by premier nikolai i ryzhkov 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze defense minister dmitri t 
yazov and other top soviet officials the official news agency 
tass said 
the west german leader and his wife hannelore were received by 
gorbachev and his wife raisa in st georges hall of the kremlin 
tass said the two leaders then held talks in the st catherines 
hall the agency said 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher defense minister rupert 
scholz and other cabinet members were in the west german delegation 
that accompanied kohl from bonn 
the development of economic ties likely will top the discussions 
during kohls visit as west german businesses seek to profit from 
what they say are growing opportunities created by gorbachevs 
economic reforms 
projected joint ventures range from the development of the 
mineralrich kola peninsula in the northwestern part of the soviet 
union to the construction of factories in various parts of the 
communist nation 
other items on the agenda include european disarmament 
eastwest relations ties between west germany and moscowallied 
east germany and the fate of some 2 million soviets of german 
ethnic origin 
on oct 14 the west german embassy in moscow said gorbachev and 
kohl would sign an accord on scientific cooperation in space 
the embassy gave no details 
the embassy also said kohl and gorbachev would sign agreements 
on agricultural cooperation and environmental protection and that 
other agreements will be signed by private firms with soviet 
agencies 
the west germans are looking for an improved political climate 
in central europe that bonn hopes will translate into the 
willingness of communist east germany to relax barriers that have 
kept family and friends apart since germany was divided just after 
world war ii 
in his public appearances this year kohl has praised 
gorbachevs reforms advocated western economic assistance to the 
soviets and stressed the importance of having good relations with 
the kremlin 
kohl last met gorbachev in march 1985 when he attended the 
funeral of communist party general secretary konstantin chernenko 
gorbachev became party general secretary after chernenkos death 
he became president less than a month ago 
relations between the two world war ii enemies soured by kohls 
1983 agreement to deploy us pershing mediumrange missiles in 
west germany have improved markedly since the soviet union and the 
united states last year signed a treaty to ban such missiles

the defense department is investigating an 
orange county company whose faulty production of a critical part 
forced the navy to abandon 500 phoenix missiles worth 425 million 
the los angeles times reported today 
micronics international in brea is suspected of using a 
substandard production process for making the missiles fuze its 
safety and arming mechanism according to the newspaper 
rodney hansen special agent in charge of the defense department 
inspector generals office in santa ana confirmed that it is 
conducting a criminal investigation into the concern 
the phoenix the principal weapon for the navys f14 fighter 
is a radarguided missile designed to fire at enemy aircraft 100 
miles away 
but the supply of 850000 missiles is useless because of the 
failure of the 4500 part which fires the warhead and also 
prevents premature firing of the missile navy officials told the 
times 
the company began manufacturing proper fuzes in february the 
navy said those are expected to be installed in the warehoused 
missiles by next years end 
ew ritter micronics business manager in phoenix said the 
company had been subpoenaed early this month for documents 
involving the missile program but said they werent told they were 
the subject of a criminal investigation 
company officials previously placed the blame for the fuze 
failures on navy designs and an investigation previously conducted 
by the general accounting office concluded that the navy shared 
responsibility for the manufacturing problems 
the company a subsidiary of la jollabased precision aerotech 
refused to comment about its work on the phoenix program 
micronics contracts over the last three years with the navy air 
systems command for the fuzes totaled nearly 54 million 
the company is accused of using a process called sand 
casting to form the devices in that process sand is used to 
mold the hot metal products resulting from this process have a 
pitted porous surface that fail to meet contract specifications 
according to the times the navy required the company to use a 
process called investment casting in which molten metal is 
poured into a wax mold to produce a smoothly finished product that 
can meet precise specifications

recent and future environmental regulations 
could impose significant costs on small towns farmers and small 
businesses and mean increases averaging 100 to 170 in municipal 
fees per household by 1996 according to a study by the 
environmental protection agency 
an inhouse epa committee report to administrator lee m thomas 
suggests that the agency and state governments might have to 
consider new ways to help those affected by some 85 major rules 
involving everything from pesticide use to controls on dry cleaning 
solvents 
the committee made no attempt to assess the benefits of the 
regulations but cautioned they must not be ignored 
it suggested that federal state and local governments consider 
among other things public education as one helpful tactic 
making people aware of the potential net benefits to be gained 
by investing in environmental protection should provide a better 
forum for assessing the merits of the project the committee 
wrote 
it said the agency may need to encourage other tactics such as 
more technical assistance changes in fee structures grants to 
particularly poor communities and incentives to cooperate with 
others as in regional water systems embracing several communities 
warning that cost estimates couldnt be derived for several 
important regulations such as asbestos control in schools the 
study said the average household nationwide by 1996 might have to 
pay 100 a year more in charges fees and taxes because of 
regulations on drinking water waste water treatment and solid 
waste disposal 
the cost was greater at the extremes an average of 170 more 
in communities under 2500 residents and 160 in communities of at 
least 250000 
in 20 percent of the smaller places current charges could more 
than double but nationwide only 2 percent of the households would 
see an increase that large 
people living in smaller communities generally have lower 
incomes and the study estimated current and future costs for these 
environmental services could total 07 percent of household income 
for towns of fewer than 2500 people compared with 05 percent for 
larger places 
based on the finances of a sample of 207 municipalities the 
study estimated that 21 percent to 30 percent of communities of 
fewer than 2500 people could have trouble financing capital 
expenditures the regulations are expected to require only 3 
percent to 7 percent of larger communities were expected to have 
similar problems 
no such sample was possible for farms so the committee examined 
the books of typical farms in average and vulnerable 
financial conditions for thee types of operations an illinois 
corn and soybean operation of which there are about 31000 a 
mississippi farm growing cotton and soybeans of which there are 
about 1800 and a kansas farm producing wheat and cattle of which 
there are about 20000 
assuming that the agency tried to promulgate regulations with 
minimum costs and that not every farmer in average financial 
condition had to meet every requirement a kind of average 
impact scenario income before depreciation would fall by 3 
percent for the mississippi and kansas farms and by 07 percent for 
the illinois farm 
if all such farms had to meet all requirements income would 
fall by 8 percent for the illinois farm 18 percent for the 
mississippi farm and 24 percent for the kansas farm 
in the worst case epa would promulgate regulations bearing 
heavy costs that all farmers would have to meet a highly 
improbable upper bound since only a few farms would be so heavily 
affected the illinois farm would lose 26 percent of its income 
the mississippi farm would lose 24 percent and the kansas farm 
would lose 84 percent 
a vulnerable kansas farm with current negative net cash 
income will go out of business in 1996 anyway but a year earlier 
under some possible scenarios the report said 
the committee also examined a few speciality crops and concluded 
that even average impact fungicide restrictions could have 
dramatic effects on apple growers in michigan and new york but not 
washington state 
if the agency goes allout with highcost regulations new york 
growers could see a drop of 60 percent in their current 220 net 
return per acre and michigan growers could lose 84 percent of 
their 80 per acre washington returns would barely change from 
330 increasing by 02 percent because apple prices would rise 
relatively few nonfarm small businesses will be affected by 
epas regulations seventy percent of the nations 35 small 
businesses those with fewer than 50 employees are in 
nonpolluting fields such as wholesale and retail trade finance or 
other services 
but the committee said it was able to identify several 
industries where costs to comply with future regulations had a good 
chance of eating up either 30 percent of annual profits or 
requiring capital expenditures of more than 30 percent of the 
owners investment 
most prominent are dry cleaners who may be faced with expensive 
controls on solvent emissions and service stations where only 
the strongest financially would be able to meet costs of cleaning 
up any leaking underground storage tanks 
small electroplaters wood preservers and pesticide formulators 
could have difficulty meeting toxic chemical regulations if they 
have leaking underground tanks farm supply stores and trucking 
companies also could be vulnerable

airport workers have painted lines and 
installed strobe lights to separate taxiways and a runway that 
pilots say were so confusing they nearly caused nine collisions of 
delta jets in the past year 
federal records show the latest incident of pilot confusion at 
dallasfort worth international over where the aircraft parking 
ramp outside delta air lines terminal ended and a taxiway began 
was aug 31 the same day another delta plane crashed on takeoff 
in that incident the pilot of delta flight 297 mistakenly 
turned left onto a runway and into the path of delta flight 638 
which was cleared for takeoff according to federal aviation 
administration records 
it was pretty scary that could have easily been a terrible 
accident said tower manager norm scroggins he said it was the 
only time two planes reached the runway at the same time 
a tower controller spotted flight 297 on the runway just after 
it turned and told flight 297 to halt while another controller 
told flight 638 to abort takeoff records show 
an faa investigative report indicates flight 638 came to a stop 
a few yards from flight 297 
it was a relatively lowspeed abort but the pilot decided to 
let his brakes cool for about 10 minutes before heading back up the 
runway scroggins said 
a few hours later delta flight 1141 bound for salt lake city 
crashed just after takeoff killing 14 people that crash is still 
under investigation 
the runway confusion first occurred in october 1987 after the 
airport covered grass islands between the parking apron and inner 
taxiway with concrete 
a lot of pilots use the grass to guide them said richard 
petit the airports senior director of planning and engineering 
problem was there were a bunch more who cut the corners short 
and their landing gear went into the grass 
because there is no grass between the ramp and the inner 
taxiway we had several pilots who believed the runway was the 
outer taxiway scroggins said 
in recent weeks workers have painted thick black stripes 
outlined with yellow to mark the inner taxiway and have identified 
the taxiway with 10foot letters and strobe lights 
officials said procedures for directing delta flights to the 
runways also have changed so planes avoid taxiway 29 which leads 
directly from the ramp area to runway 17l the first of two 
parallel runways on the airports east side 
delta spokeswoman jackie pate told the fort worth startelegram 
the airline has handdelivered notices to all of its pilots 
alerting them about the taxiway

police said today a us organization was 
the intended recipient of the photographs of american hostages in 
lebanon that were found in a lebanese womans luggage at milans 
airport 
the woman was supposed to deliver the pictures and a handwritten 
letter bearing hostage alann steens name to an italian arms 
trader aldo anghessa police said the photographs were of steen 
american reporter terry anderson and a third man 
anghessa acted as a gobetween between the two parties one 
party was a lebanese organization said achille serra head of 
milans antiterrorist police 
he said the other group was american but refused to elaborate 
on the identity of either organization or say if the us 
government was involved 
the newspaper il giornale of milan reported without attribution 
today that anghessa was to give the photos and letter to us 
diplomats but the arrest of the woman spoiled the operation the 
us embassy declined comment on the report 
serra said police do not know if anghessa was part of an effort 
to free the hostages as italian media has speculated 
anghessa who has been linked to italian and swiss secret 
services and was at the center of an international arms scandal 
last year was questioned by police after the womans arrest 
thursday after arriving at milans linate airport from beirut 
anghessa was released but police planned to interrogate him again 
serra said 
the lebanese woman identified as aline ibrahim rizkallah 36 
was jailed and charged with carrying 1000 in counterfeit us 
bills and 50 grams of heroin police said 
the woman said anghessa was not connected to the drug shipment 
police said 
the rome daily la repubblica reported sunday that anghessa had 
ties to the us drug enforcement administration 
a us embassy spokesman said there is no repeat no record 
of anghessa having ever assisted dea officers in italy 
in an interview published in todays edition of the romebased 
newspaper il messaggero anghessa was quoted as saying he was 
willing to cooperate with this investigation but i swear i know 
absolutely nothing 
police were examining the photographs to determine whether they 
were originals or copies of newspaper pictures serra said 
serra said police have ruled out that hostage thomas sutherland 
was the man in the third photo the man who police earlier 
believed to be sutherland has not been identified 
police have asked us authorities for samples of steens 
handwriting to authenticate the letter bearing his name said 
fortunato finoli deputy director of the antiterrorist police 
anghessa 44 who has dual swissitalian nationality was 
arrested following the 1987 seizure of a lebanese cargo ship off 
bari in southern italy police said the ship was carrying drugs and 
weapons for use by the mafia and middle east terrorists 
anghessa was charged with international drug trafficking and 
organizing groups for illegal export of weapons and terrorist ends 
the charges were later dropped 
the lebanese woman said she was a courier and denied knowledge 
of the photos letter or other documents written in italian that 
were hidden in her suitcase police said 
she told police an italian man was to receive the photographs 
and documents police traced anghessa through a telephone number in 
the womans purse newspapers said 
authorities were trying to decipher the coded documents finoli 
said the letter bearing steens name was written in english and 
expressed thanks to everyone who was working for his 
liberation finoli said 
anderson and sutherland are held by proiranian islamic jihad 
while steens kidnapping was claimed by the islamic jihad for the 
liberation of palestine 
in beirut on sunday islamic jihad distributed a photo of 
anderson and repeated its demand for the release of its guerrillas

rep pat swindall said he was in good spirits and 
confident of acquittal when he arrived at federal court today for 
his speededup trial on charges of lying to a grand jury about 
seeking an 850000 mortgage 
i have absolutely no problem when it comes to the truth i 
know the truth is on my side he told reporters 
swindalls perjury trial was to start at 930 am but was 
delayed 
the 38yearold twoterm republican congressman has contended 
that any discrepancies in his grand jury testimony were memory 
lapses while waiting for the trial to begin swindall joked with 
reporters and at one point in discussing his defense plans he 
qualified a statement by saying but my memory is not that good 
the perjury trial stems from swindalls negotiation of a loan 
with a man he knew as mike martinez who actually was undercover 
internal revenue service agent michael mullaney 
swindall told the grand jury in february that he was suspicious 
even afraid of martinez but said his talks with martinez never 
gave him reason to go to authorities 
the government contends mullaney gave swindall plenty of reason 
to believe the 850000 home mortgage loan he was seeking would 
come from the drug trade 
the prosecution claims swindall lied to the grand jury about his 
dealings with mullaney and charles lechasney who has pleaded 
guilty to money laundering charges which do not involve the 
congressman 
swindall who is representing himself has said he got tripped 
up by a memory test in his feb 2 grand jury appearance and 
has vowed to prove he did not intend to deceive 
the trial comes in the final stages of a bitter election 
campaign between swindall and democrat ben jones who played cooter 
on the dukes of hazzard television show 
a poll conducted by the atlanta journal and the atlanta 
constitution last week found jones leading swindall 53 percent to 
27 percent with a margin of error of 3 percentage points 
swindall was indicted just a week ago he demanded a swift trial 
in an effort to clear his name before the nov 8 election 
swindall is accused of concealing knowledge that something 
illegal was being planned by lechasney and martinez the 
indictment says that when the congressman was asked why he did not 
take his admitted suspicions to authorities he replied 
because i never satisfied myself of anything with respect to 
criminality other than i did not feel comfortable that the deal 
was a right deal i did not want to get in the posture of if i 
could avoid it putting myself in the position of pointing my 
finger at what could be a drug person who could very well 
jeopardize myself and my family i frankly hoped that he was 
legitimate 
the transcript of the governments tape recording of a sept 13 
1987 meeting says the undercover agent told swindall all i can 
tell you is that my gut feeling is there are narcotics dollars in 
there thats it 
i dont recall any conversation like that i dont 
remember ever the term narcotic used swindall told the grand 
jury but he said he smelled trouble and i walked away from it 
basically 
twelve days after that meeting swindall accepted a 150000 
check from lechasney the prosecution claims swindall was lying 
when he said the check was not part of his negotiations with the 
undercover agent

while the eyes of the world focused on 
the effort to free two gray whales stranded in ice near barrow 
rescuers helped save 27 beluga whales that spent more than seven 
hours trapped in mud near anchorage 
the whale pod apparently midjudged the tide and beached itself 
at about 10 am sunday on a mud bar about halfway betwen girdwood 
and portage along the seward highway south of anchorage 
dozens of people jammed the roadside to watch the silverwhite 
whales gently flopping on the mud steam rising from their 
blowholes the whales ranged in size from about 6feetlong to 
16feetlong 
kayakers jim diehl and riley cronk braved the treacherous 
mudflats and swirling currents to spend more than an hour with the 
whales pouring water on them and wrapping them in wet tarps and 
blankets until they could swim free 
they were all alive they looked all wrinkly when we first got 
there and when we left they werent wrinkly any more diehl said 
a helicopter ferried veterinarian tex cody and national oceanic 
and atmospheric administration biologists to the stranded animals 
and us fish and wildlife service law enforcement agents also 
visited them 
we went in and checked all the animals bathed their eyes and 
kept them wet said roger mercer a noaa biologist the men threw 
another dozen wet blankets over the whales and waited for the tide 
the tide came in at about 535 pm it was really kind of 
exciting mercer said as soon as the tidal water hit them 
they started flopping around and then kicking 
the helicopter hovered nearby as the whales swam to freedom

a gun battle sent hundreds of people dashing for 
cover at the texas state fair and ended with one man dead and three 
wounded but officials declared the 1988 fair a success and said 
overall crime was down 
despite that isolated incident friday the officers on the 
detail this year worked extremely hard to make this a safe fair 
said dallas police deputy chief rl schifelbein 
several fights broke out late friday and schifelbein who 
oversees fair security decided to begin closing things down for 
the night police had taken a pistol from a 14yearold boy who 
pulled it from a pocket during a scuffle with several youths 
within a few hours officers had seized pistols from three other 
people 
lord only knows what we didnt get schifelbein said it 
was obvious there were groups who came out here for the express 
purpose of creating problems 
then came the battle in which 18yearold bobby joe nabors jr 
died of multiple gunshot wounds after he shot three other men 
police said 
the first officer on the scene sgt manuel vasquez said he saw 
nabors shoot joey henry and tried to wrest the gun away vasquez 
was shot in the hand during that struggle henry and another man 
were in serious condition at parkland memorial hospital 
offduty police cpl james t daily 38 who was working 
security at the midway saw henry lying on the ground and nabors 
and vasquez struggling police said nabors pointed his pistol 
toward daily and daily fired at him daily told investigators he 
believed nabors fired back and the officer shot at nabors again 
however police said nabors was shot three times in the chest 
and once in each arm investigators said the five wounds may have 
been caused by fewer than five bullets but police were unsure 
whose gun fired the bullets that killed nabors and arent assuming 
that only one person fired at nabors 
eight pregnant women and several bystanders also were injured 
when surrounding crowds pushed and shoved in a scramble to reach 
shelter 
in addition to the shooting at least four people were slightly 
injured saturday when a ferris wheel malfunctioned jolting back 
and forth several times and swaying uncontrollably the dallas 
morning news reported 
fair communication director nancy wiley said 29 million people 
visited this years 17day fair which ended sunday night 
attendance was up from 276 million in 1987 she said 
schifelbein said preliminary figures indicated 112 criminal 
offenses were committed at this years fair that compares to 146 
criminal offenses last year he said

as about 200 tourists trekked along the samaria gorge and one man 
was killed and five people were reported missing police said 
some hikers sought refuge in a cave and others scrambled into 
clefts in the rocky walls of the 11mile long gorge as the water 
rushed through a police officer said 
the rain has knocked out the phone to the village there so we 
dont know exactly what happened it seems there was a sudden flood 
in a narrow part of the gorge said the officer who requested 
anonymity in accordance with greek practice 
he said the body of a man in his 30s had been recovered but not 
yet identified 
tourism minister nikos skoulas was flying to crete to supervise 
rescue efforts 
the samaria gorge the longest in europe descends from an 
upland plain to the southern coast of crete its cliffs rise more 
than 100 feet high and it narrows to around 10 feet wide at some

a man arrested during a drug raid on his home 
must pay tax on 143912 confiscated in the raid even though the 
money immediately became government property the us tax court 
says 
filippo gambina of middle village ny contended that the cash 
never came into his possession or control and thus that he had no 
obligation to report it as taxable income 
the court in a decision made public today said nothing in the 
1984 comprehensive crime control act indicates that congress 
intended that a taxpayer whose property is forfeited should be 
relieved of the income tax consequences that would have attached 
without said forfeiture 
indeed that history clearly reveals that congress 
intended to maximize the financial benefit of forfeiture to the 
united states as against third parties who prior to the 
forfeiture had acquired the fruits of the taxpayers criminal 
activities other than in a bona fide transaction the court said 
freeing a person from having to report such money would have the 
same effect as allowing a deduction for the amount a deduction 
which has been denied on the ground that it would frustrate public 
policy the court added 
this is the first time the tax court has reached such a 
conclusion although the us district court in eastern louisiana 
made a similar ruling in another case last march

a report by an inquiry commission 
today blamed pilot error for the fiery collision of three italian 
jets that killed 69 people at the us ramstein air base 
the three italian stunt jets collided during an air show aug 
28 and one of the jets plunged into the crowd and exploded in 
flames all three pilots were among the dead 
the collision occurred as the pilot referred to in the report as 
the solo pilot was trying to fly through a heartshaped 
formation made by the other two planes 
the cause of the midair collision between the solo pilot and 
two other planes from the italian stunt flying team frecce 
tricolori has been determined to have been human error by the solo 
pilot the report said 
the report issued by the west german defense ministry said other 
possible causes of the disaster such as technical failure or 
collision with a flock of birds could be ruled out 
the commission has determined that there was no violation of 
safety regulations for air shows that are binding for nato member 
states the report said the organizer had fulfilled 
corresponding safety requirements and in part had even increased 
them 
however the report recommended that north atlantic treaty 
organization member states make a critical reassessment of air 
shows in light if this tragic accident 
the commission included american italian and west german 
experts and was led by the west german military flight safety 
authority

the government will publish some 
of franz kafkas works and correspondence a cultural weekly said 
the magazine kmen organ of the official union of czech writers 
said part of kafkas correspondence was purchased from a 
secondhand bookshop in prague two years ago 
among the stories to be published are his last completed novel 
the castle published in 1926 and amerika which came out 
in 1927 the magazine said 
kafkas works are highly acclaimed in the west but have been 
barely acknowledged in prague where he was born in 1883 
rejected for what was described as morbid pessimism and 
alienation the communists allowed both the 100th anniverasry 
of kafkas birth and the 60th anniversary of his death to pass with 
little fanfare in the 1980s 
the intellectual flowering of the mid1960s led to the 
construction of pragues only public memorial to kafka near the 
street where he lived 
kmen described kafka as an integral part of prague literary 
scene todays remembrance of kafka is not an act of piety or 
strategy but a fact of a simple refreshment of cultural memory

pope john paul ii urged us bishops monday 
to persuade couples to embrace marriage and reject abortion and 
contraception lamenting a world that often reduces sex to the 
pursuit of pleasure 
in a speech to 18 visiting bishops from michigan and ohio the 
pope said he wanted to commemorate the 20th anniversary of pope 
paul vis encyclical humanae vita which reaffirmed the churchs 
ban on artificial birth control 
we see ever more clearly today how relevant and positive it 
is the pontiff told the delegation headed by cardinal edmund 
szoka of detroit 
the pope speaking in english said the bishops should increase 
efforts to spread the churchs teaching on marriage and family 
issues especially the sexual dimension 
in a world that often reduces sex to the pursuit of pleasure 
and in some cases to domination the church has a special mission 
to place sex in the context of conjugal love and of generous and 
responsible openness to parenthood john paul said 
as pastors we must encourage couples to maintain an openness 
to life and a spirit of joyful sharing in regard to children he 
said children are really the supreme gift of marriage but 
materialistic and selfish attitudes often deny the value of the 
child 
the pope said he deeply appreciated the efforts of the us 
bishops conference to defend the church position that life starts 
with conception 
throughout the world we have seen an increase in the number of 
abortions and a decline in the protection of unborn human life 
he said the bishops of the united states have steadfastly 
opposed this destruction of human life by programs of education and 
pastoral care and by advocating laws and public policies that 
protect and sustain human life before and after birth 
referring again to abortion and birth control the pope said 
we must emphasize the sanctity of human life as a precious 
gift from god that needs to be protected and fostered while making 
more systematic efforts to offer instruction in the natural methods 
of family planning 
natural family planning enables couples to understand gods 
design for sex and invites them to dialogue mutual respect 
shared responsibility and selfcontrol 
john paul also reminded the bishops of the importance of 
priestly celibacy describing it as a gift from god 
the rule of celibacy for the latin church is more than 
ecclesiastical law he said it has deep theological and 
doctrinal roots

a steellined boxcar loaded with lowlevel 
nuclear waste from rocky flats nuclear weapons plant returned to 
the plant today after being ordered out of idaho over the weekend 
but colorado gov roy romer has urged that the boxcar remain on 
railroad tracks and its cargo of rags clothing and equipment 
contaminated by plutonium residue be kept aboard until another 
storage site can be found elsewhere 
ed heintz director of communications for rockwell international 
which operates rocky flats for the department of energy said the 
boxcar will remain on a siding until officials can decide where to 
send the waste 
idaho gov cecil d andrus on saturday turned the unwanted 
boxcar back from a temporary storage site at idaho falls and 
banned further shipments to his state before then it had spent 
several days in limbo at a railyard in blackfoot idaho 
romer on sunday then rejected a department of energy request to 
expand lowlevel radioactive waste storage at rocky flats 
im not going to authorize an enlargement of that storage the 
reason being i do not want colorado to be the escape valve for 
everybodys failure to provide a permanent site romer said 
doe had planned to transfer the waste from the idaho site to new 
mexico when the waste isolation pilot plant permanent disposal site 
there opens the wipp facility was scheduled to be open this month 
but the date has been pushed back at least until early next year 
if the wipp site opens in january as the doe now plans rocky 
flats wastes will account for more than 70 percent of the debris to 
be buried in salt deposits 2500 feet underground 
i met with doe and they said would you expand the 
authorization to store at rocky flats and my answer was no 
romer told the associated press in a telephone interview 
i said you can keep the authorization for storage you now 
have but i will not enlarge the storage there is an interim 
arrangement which provides for about 1600 cubic yards of material 
i said you can bring the railcar back but the capacity that 
the railcar takes has to be a part of the original interim 
agreement romer said 
i also asked them not to unload that car but to leave it 
loaded and to leave it on the track so we can work to find another 
destination for it romer said 
romer said he hoped to confer with other governors in the region 
on finding a way to get the new mexico site open as soon as 
possible 
romer said about 650 yards of lowlevel waste has been stored at 
rocky flats leaving about 950 cubic yards to go until its storage 
limit is reached

republican party i dont think anyone who is outregistered 21 
can take anything for granted 
and so it stands two weeks before election day 
george bush is ahead but uneasy lies the crown 
michael dukakis picked up an underdogs second wind last week 
answering weeks of spectacular bush advertising with some creative 
counterattacks of his own and stumping the industrial midwest with 
a fervent critique of republican economics 
george bush cares about the people on easy street dukakis 
told a crowd last week in kalamazoo mich i care about the 
people on main street hes on their side im on your side 
the corpse winked this week in michigan wrote a columnist 
for the detroit free press even as rep vin weber rminn was 
euphorically forecasting a bush republican landslide 
in kansas democratic chairman jim parrish said i hope the 
republicans think its over they could be in for the shock of 
their lives this race will not end until nov 8 
of course many people think it ended oct 13 the night of the 
second and final presidential debate conventional wisdom said 
dukakis needed a breakthrough to regain his footing in the 
presidential race there was none 
in the 10 days since dukakis has unveiled a strongly worded 
message of economic populism democrats are glad to see him on the 
attack but dukakis doesnt always seem comfortable there himself 
he slid into a booth beside tim lachina and his daughter last 
monday at shortys diner in cleveland where lachina implored 
lets kick some ass out there to which dukakis replied 
somewhat less emphatically ok very good well do it 
in recent days the republicans have been walking a fine line 
between overconfidence in private and cautious optimism in 
public 
you dont want to be goliath in these situations quoth bush 
campaign manager lee atwater the crowd is always cheering for 
david 
not everyone is finding it easy to adhere to discipline on this 
gop vice presidential candidate dan quayle was crowing friday 
night that the democrats might end up on election night having a 
onestate strategy or maybe theyll just have a district of 
columbia strategy 
perhaps quayle should speak with the governor of kansas before 
writing david off 
kansas is a republican state where bush has suffered from the 
vicissitudes of the farm economy and the criticisms of senate gop 
leader bob dole theres one thing i know you never take 
anything for granted gov mike hayden was saying last week 
you never let up its ours to win but its also ours to lose 
with so many voters disenchanted with both candidates oklahoma 
gop chairman cole had no particular difficulty fighting off the 
urge to complacency 
we have a good lead in oklahoma he said of bush and quayle 
we were eight points down in august and now we are 10 points 
ahead according to the same poll thats not enough to say this 
thing is over at the same time in 1984 we had more than a 25 
percent lead 
so cole looks for something to worry about and in common with 
republicans across much of the country when he casts his eyes 
across his political kingdom he sees a lot of voters with the 
habit of pulling democratic levers four of oklahomas six 
congressman are democrats along with more than two thirds of the 
legislature 
not that this tendency to vote democratic extends itself to 
presidential elections on an electoral map where republican 
victories are painted in stripes you have to go back to the lbj 
landslide of 1964 to find oklahoma in a democratic shade 
this of course is one of the mysteries of the universe on a par 
with yasser arafats permanent stubble and flatscreen tv how is 
it that the democrats can control the nations city halls its 
legislatures its statehouses and both houses of congress and yet 
since 1952 they have won the white house just three times in nine 
tries 
in quayles indiana six democratic congressmen out of 10 but 
truly one of the more republican states in the country gop 
chairman gordon k durnil was worrying recently that a lastminute 
event could yet produce a sudden turn in dukakis favor 
its never over until it happens he said 
what me goliath

george bush declared today there isnt any racism in his 
ads and he denied democratic charges of republican lying michael 
dukakis renewed the allegation of lying saying the republicans 
cant win if they discuss the issues truthfully 
with two weeks to go in the presidential election republican 
bush was campaigning in connecticut and other northeastern states 
while dukakis was seeking support in voterich california 
reacting to weekend talk of racism bush told reporters today 
its absolutely ridiculous and everybody sees this as some 
desperation kind of move basing it on one ad 
bush was referring to democratic complaints that the republicans 
have been appealing to racial fears in bushs speeches and ads 
stressing the case of willie horton jr a black convicted murderer 
who raped a white woman after escaping from a massachusetts prison 
furlough 
i mean people see this for what it is a campaign tactic i 
stand 100 percent behind those ads i think the american people are 
smart bush said 
he added that the democrats are running an ad about a man from a 
bushsupported houston halfway house who murdered a ministers 
wife bush asked what about their ad about the halfway house is 
that racism against hispanics 
he is upset not because its false but because he is weak on 
crime and defense and thats the inescapable truth bush said at 
a campaign breakfast in waterbury conn 
dukakis said at a rally in los angeles you know mark twain 
once said that a lie can travel halfway around the world while the 
truth is still putting on its shoes mr bush must have read mark 
twain because hes running a campaign based on distortions and 
distractions and outright lies 
why because he cant win an election where the real issues 
are discussed the real challenges are faced and the real 
differences are made known 
dukakis renewed his criticism of bushs proposal for a capital 
gains tax credit which dukakis said would give bush himself an 
annual tax break of 22000 
george bush wants to give people like george bush a tax break 
thats more than the average california worker makes in a year 
dukakis said 
bush on the other hand said in a speech prepared for delivery 
to a business group in waterbury my opponent now wants to turn 
back to clog up the circulatory system of americas economy with 
exactly the kind of big government schemes the europeans are 
discarding 
dukakis was spending the entire day in california including 
stops in los angeles and san francisco in pursuit of that crucial 
states 47 electoral votes 
republican vice presidential candidate dan quayle was going to 
be accompanied by his mother corrine quayle during his first stop 
in missouri he was going on to kentucky 
democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen was 
campaigning in michigan missouri and arkansas 
dukakis stopping sunday night in eau claire wis attacked the 
republican ticket for what he called its steady stream of 
distortion and misrepresentation 
although dukakis didnt mention it campaign vicechairman john 
sasso said the candidate agreed with assertions by bentsen and 
black leader jesse jackson that there were racist overtones to some 
bush tactics 
bentsen told a television interviewer he thought the bush 
campaign was making a racist appeal by focusing on willie horton 
jr a black convicted murderer who escaped in 1986 from a 
massachusetts prison furlough 
in 1987 horton stabbed a white maryland man and raped the mans 
fiancee horton is currently imprisoned in maryland 
asked on abctvs this week with david brinkley if use of 
the horton case constituted an element of republican racist 
appeal bentsen replied when you add it up i think there is 
and thats unfortunate and i just dont want to see this election 
won on that kind of packaging and that kind of distortions 
in boston jackson avoided the word racist but said the 
horton case was one of several rather ugly raceconscious 
signals sent out by the bush campaign 
there have been a number of rather blatantly raceconscious 
signals that have had the impact of instilling ungrounded fear in 
whites and alienation from blacks jackson said after a 90minute 
breakfast he and other black political leaders had with dukakis 
dukakis meeting with the black leaders was the first such 
gathering since the democratic convention said dukakis spokesman 
mark gearan a session with hispanic leaders was planned for 
wednesday 
jackson emerged from the meeting pledging to work harder for 
dukakis and on sunday night in atlanta he delivered a speech 
calling bush one who runs against civil liberties civil rights 
womens rights the poor and the homeless 
in other developments a new poll conducted for the dallas 
morning news and the houston chronicle showed the bushquayle 
ticket led the dukakisbentsen ticket among likely texas voters by 
52 percent to 42 percent 
the survey of 776 potential voters conducted between oct 17 and 
oct 20 had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage 
points 
a poll by the milwaukee sentinel showed support for dukakis 
slipping in wisconsin he was backed by 47 percent of the likely 
voters compared with 45 percent for bush dukakis had led 5039 in 
august 
the telephone survey oct 1418 of 687 likely voters had a 
fourpoint margin of error in either direction 
nebraskas largest newspaper the omaha worldherald today 
endorsed bush over dukakis the editorial cited bushs experience 
as well as his stands on the issues

lowell p weicker jr a threeterm 
senate maverick who regularly enrages fellow republicans with his 
independence once seemed an easy bet for reelection in 
connecticut but hes suddenly running scared 
his opponent is joseph i lieberman the states popular 
democratic attorney general for the past six years a lawyer and 
the son of a stamford liquor store owner 
lieberman is a lackluster campaigner who missed his own 
nomination for the senate last summer because the party convention 
was held on saturday while he was observing the sabbath as an 
orthodox jew 
but lieberman also was the democrats top statewide votegetter 
in 1982 and ranked second in 1986 a selfstyled peoples 
lawyer he churns out reams of press releases about his campaigns 
against polluters grocery chains and unscrupulous auto dealers 
he is the bestfinanced challenger that weicker has ever faced 
and weicker who has never lost an election is fighting the 
toughest battle of his political life which began with his 
election to the state house of representatives 26 years ago 
a connecticut poll published last week by the hartford courant 
showed that lieberman who once trailed weicker by 24 points had 
surged to a 3939 tie with 22 percent undecided 
weicker said the poll was an aberration and that other 
independent surveys conducted shortly beforehand showed him leading 
by 10 points or more lieberman said the latest poll confirmed his 
contentions that victory in the nov 8 election is within his grasp 
as if weickers troubles werent enough the conservative 
buckley family is nipping at his heels 
a family buckpac the fundraising arm of buckleys for 
lieberman reported raising 373750 to be spent mostly on local 
newspaper ads attacking weicker as a farout liberal who should 
forsake the republican label 
marla romash of the lieberman campaign said national review 
editor william f buckley jr helped raise money for the democratic 
candidate not because he likes joe lieberman but because he hates 
lowell weicker 
snorted weicker they care about their ultraconservative 
principles be damned with the party 
weicker is known for his frequent bashing of president reagan 
and other fellow republicans especially president nixon for his 
watergate misdeeds he opposes the balanced budget amendment to the 
constitution favored by many republicans and condemned reagans 
military actions against libya and grenada 
in a state where democrats hold a 3to2 edge over republicans 
weicker owes his unbroken string of election successes to his 
appeal among connecticuts 550000 unaffiliated voters 
he also has won support among traditionally democratic groups 
his endorsements this year by the connecticut state aflcio and 
connecticut freeze voter a nuclear arms freeze organization were 
shrugged off by lieberman as the sort that any incumbent senator 
might get 
as lieberman has narrowed the gap the campaign has become 
increasingly shrill 
lieberman is running television commercials depicting weicker as 
a bear who sleeps through important senate votes 
lieberman claims weickers 90 percent attendance record is among 
the worst in the senate where he has served since 1970 weicker 
says 90 percent is an a in anybodys book 
at weeks end weicker raised questions about liebermans 
attendance record during his 10 years in the state senate before he 
became attorney general 
weicker also began airing a tv ad featuring lieberman singing 
weickers praises at a 1986 testimonial the spot ends with the 
announcer saying if lieberman believes what he says hell vote 
for weicker 
the two men have already set a spending record for a connecticut 
senate campaign lieberman has raised about 18 million to 
weickers 22 million according to financial reports issued this 
month theyre expected to spend another 1 million between them 
before the election is over

republicans and democrats agree that the 100th 
congress compiled a formidable record of achievement but the 
legislators also left behind a list of unsolved issues ranging from 
the minimum wage to cleaning up the countrys air and helping 
families 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said monday from our 
point of view the 100th congress has been very productive and we 
are extraordinarily pleased that so many parts of the presidents 
agenda have been enacted into law 
fitzwater said congress which adjourned early saturday left 
about 120 bills on reagans desk the president will veto some and 
sign the others fitzwater said but the spokesman did not know 
which ones would be rejected 
shortly before congress adjourned senate majority leader robert 
byrd dwva told his colleagues the democraticcontrolled 100th 
congress had a record of decisive action we have produced 
results across the board 
but byrd added that even so much remains to be tackled and 
our time is about to expire the 101st congress has some formidable 
challenges to address 
house republican leader bob michel rill agreed i think it 
was quite successful overall but there were also some things we 
didnt get that we would have liked 
a number of the unresolved issues involve domestic policy 
fights such as the minimum wage familyrelated legislation and 
cleaning up the nations air 
since 1981 the minimum wage has been 335 per hour but 
democrats in recent months pushed for an increase it was a drive 
they hoped to turn into political gains during the election 
campaign 
democrats succeeded in bringing to the senate floor a bill that 
would have raised the minimum wage to 455 per hour over a 
threeyear period but republicans said they would filibuster 
unless the judiciary committee voted to approve 25 of president 
reagans judicial appointments 
the senate tried to cut off debate but that move only picked up 
56 votes four short of the 60 needed that moved minimum wage 
legislation to the back burner 
a look at some of the other unfinished business

clean air the senate considered a bill which would have tried 
to control acid rain by restricting smokestack emissions along 
with tightening autoemission standards and restricting the burning 
of toxic chemicals but there was strong opposition in both the 
house and senate particularly from legislators representing states 
producing lowsulfur coal such as those in the rocky mountain area 
child care the senate labor and human resources committee 
voted approval in july of a bill providing 25 billion for child 
care with 75 percent of that amount ticketed for low and 
moderateincome families but opposition by a variety of groups 
including the national education association and the national 
parent teachers association stalled floor action they were 
opposed because some of the money would go to childcare centers 
sponsored by religious institutions 
parental leave democrats backed a proposal to require 
employers of 50 or more people to give up to 10 weeks of unpaid 
parental and medical leave senate republicans attached an 
amendment making child pornography a federal crime democrats tried 
to strip that provision out of the bill but failed 
impeachment the house voted 4133 on aug 3 to impeach us 
district court judge alcee l hastings of florida for high crimes 
and misdemeanors alleging perjury and conspiracy to receive a 
bribe the senate later decided to postpone the impeachment trial 
until 1989 
the house also delayed impeachment proceedings against us 
district judge walter l nixon jr of mississippi nixon is serving 
a fiveyear prison term for perjury 
south africa sanctions on aug 11 the house voted 244132 
approval of a bill to prohibit almost all trade with whiteruled 
south africa it also would have barred south african imports the 
senate foreign relations committee approved similar legislation 
but filibuster threats blocked any floor action 
airline consumer protection the house approved a bill 
requiring airlines to disclose information on flight delays and 
compensation for workers hurt by mergers the senate passed a 
similar bill but a housesenate conference committee called to 
resolve differeces broke down in fighting over provisions for the 
random testing of transportation industry employees 
campaign finance reform senate democrats backed a bill capping 
the amount senators could receive from political action committees 
republicans filibustered and there were eight unsuccessful votes 
attempting to halt the filibuster during one procedural fight over 
the filibuster arrest warrants were issued for missing senators 
and sen bob packwood rore was brought forcibly to the senate 
floor 
nuclear treaties still awaiting action are a pair of treaties 
negotiated between the soviet union and united states more than a 
decade ago they would restrict nuclear explosions to no more than 
150 kilotons president reagan had promised to push for 
ratification if an improved method could be found to verify the 
pacts

the white house accused nicaraguan president 
daniel ortega on monday of seizing upon the hurricane which 
thrashed his nation over the weekend as a tool for propaganda 
against the reagan administrations support of the contra rebels 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said no request for us aid had been 
received from the nicaraguan government and none is expected 
although the united states has provided weather information he 
said the administration would consider any request it received 
hurricane joan killed at least 50 people and left 300000 
homeless in nicaragua before weakening to a tropical storm and 
moving north to honduras and el salvador 
in managua the nicaraguan government appealed for international 
aid as authorities labored to restore communications and care for 
the homeless 
ortega asked whether the united states should send aid 
replied the best humanitarian aid the united states could give 
us would be to stop its terrorist policies against nicaragua 
citing its civil war with the ussupported rebels the 
sandinistas recently enacted a law banning aid from the united 
states but one official said the law would be waived for badly hit 
areas 
at the moment we dont have a request fitzwater said we 
are providing weather information but the question of other kinds 
of assistance hasnt come up 
asked whether a request was expected he said i frankly think 
its very unlikely 
our concern frankly is that the ortega government would use 
this as another opportunity to somehow deal adversely with the 
contras so we do have serious problems the spokesman said 
it seems clear he ortega wants to use this storm as another 
platform for propaganda against the contras fitzwater said 
he quoted ortega as saying that us aid was harming the 
country and the contras were harming the country in its ability to 
deal with the storm and those kinds of things 
he said the administration has made no judgment on the question 
of aid but added i simply point out the politicization of this 
by daniel ortega 
when asked about press restrictions imposed in nicaragua in 
connection with the storm fitzwater said to do it at this time 
under cover of a storm is really no worse really than the 
performance he has displayed for the past six or seven years in 
terms of closing down the press

the senate judiciary committee left its mark 
on the judicial confirmation process in the 100th congress but 
president reagan left his stamp on the entire federal court system 
when the clock ran out last week on two years of mostly partisan 
disputes over judicial nominations reagan nominees were sitting in 
more than half the fulltime judges chairs in the country 384 of 
752 
one who didnt make it was robert h bork his view that there 
is no explicit constitutional right of privacy helped democrats 
deny him a supreme court seat in a furious ideological battle 
throughout the 100th congress democrats controlling the senate 
judiciary committee sparred often with reagan and congressional 
republicans 
the gop said the committees majority party stalled reagans 
nominees especially near the end of the session to keep qualified 
conservatives off the courts 
committee chairman joseph r biden jr ddel called the 
delays necessary arguing that democrats refused to rubber stamp 
reagan nominees as he contended republicans did when they 
controlled the panel from 198186 
in considering supreme court nominees biden said the committee 
sent a powerful message that senators have the right to go beyond 
traditional questions about a supreme court nominees character 
they can inquire he said about whether a nominees views are 
philosophically appropriate for the times 
despite all the rhetoric reagan did reasonably well in getting 
his nominees confirmed as he fought for judges who would strictly 
follow the intent of the framers of the constitution the senate 
approved 91 nominees in the 100th congress out of 110 nominations 
according to judiciary committee statistics 
the 19 nominees not confirmed compared with 17 in the 
presidential year of 1980 when democrats controlled the senate and 
the white house and 16 in the presidential year of 1984 when 
republicans controlled the senate and the white house 
even the failure to seat bork in a senate 5842 vote in october 
1987 may turn into a triumph for reagan the justice eventually 
confirmed for the supreme court seat anthony m kennedy could 
well give the president the conservative rulings he sought from 
bork 
patrick mcguigan a conservative and senior scholar at the free 
congress center for law and democracy had this to say about the 
more conservative judiciary that reagan will leave behind 
the picture you get is that half are principled 
conservatives and the remaining range from soso to outright 
turkeys 
mcguigan who believes judges should honor the constitution 
and legislative intent not the liberal agenda said that 
onequarter of the federal judiciary is now strict construction 
conservatives opposed in every fiber of their being to judicial 
lawmaking 
mcguigan said another quarter to a third of the judiciary is 
generally conservative but can be swayed by clever lawyering 
the remainder are committed judicial activists a number of 
them very capable highly intelligent and assertive he said 
nan aron cochairwoman of the alliance for justice an 
organization of public interest legal groups said the judiciary 
committee also left its mark by exercising more scrutiny than 
when the panel was under gop control 
she said the long committee debate over bork set in motion a 
much larger public debate over the role of the courts 
in many peoples minds it established thresholds for 
standards below which nominees wouldnt be confirmed nominees were 
judged not only on their quality and integrity but their judicial 
philosophy and what they think the role of the courts are she 
said 
since reagan transformed the bench in an unprecedented 
fashion the committee will be very sensitive toward confirming 
people with clearly defined political views or ideological views 
a former committee aide under the democrats american university 
law professor herman schwartz said reagans nominees already have 
made their impact on the lives of americans 
its very difficult for minorities or women to win affirmative 
action cases when reagan appointees control the court as they do in 
many circuits now he said 
in the district of columbia circuit a lot of environmental 
cases are being thrown out on grounds of standing 
schwartz predicted that until the supreme court rules on major 
abortion cases reagan appellate court nominees will generally 
uphold many of the obstacles state and local governments throw 
up to make abortions more difficult 
schwartz noted that two reagan nominees on the district of 
columbia circuit constituted the majority on an appellate panel 
that ruled the independent counsel law violated the constitution 
the reagan administrations position 
the supreme court reversed them 71 thus upholding the law that 
allows a courtappointed counsel to investigate and prosecute top 
government officials justice kennedy did not participate

designer karl lagerfeld dropped hemlines 
dramatically in mondays chanel readytowear summer show that 
offered a dashing deauville line 
lagerfeld played with the nostalgic beach resort and old 
favorite chanel themes nicely recalling the days when 
mademoiselle herself was just starting out at the fashionable 
seaside resort 
in fact some of the long cardigan knit outfits almost looked 
like carbon copies of what chanel wore herself 
between wide aline pants and knifepleated skirts nearly to the 
ankle lagerfeld brought out a new modified jodphur shape more 
sporty than the full pants these lean trousers still had dressy 
touches like welt seaming and gold buttons up the calf 
not all was long in this beautiful group of clothes that some 
thought were generally more successful than lagerfelds collection 
under his own label a couple of nice kneebaring piped suits and 
shorter shirtwaists dressed up with rows of gold buttons looked 
chic as well 
in nautical shades of red navy and lots of white the jackets 
were either very short or very long sometimes with vestlike 
fronts and little vshaped lapels or sailor collars underlined with 
the chanel bow and camellias rather than a knotted scarf 
his boxy short jackets in delicately striped tweed had a new 
piping of braid with loops 
in addition to this easy silhouette chanel offered outfits in a 
tubular shape with pleats flaring out at the hem 
for a sexier look there were tightly fitted suits in rose and 
pink or turquoise and sky blue pipedknit jackets with very short 
lean skirts 
he also brought out some neutral shades like sand caramel and 
lichen using the latter in long pleated culottes and skirts with 
billowy organza blouses 
now the chanel woman can even wear a chanel swimsuit a new 
offering here modest though not at all nostalgic they came out 
in navy lycra with small white polka dots and were highlighted at 
waist or shoulder with the chanel bow and flower 
the chanel logo comes up on short playsuits chiffon dusters 
turnedup cuffs on pants and jacket linings as well as on silk 
crepe full evening skirts with multicolored sequin tops 
dressy looks for summer were held to a minimum but all were 
beautiful gold sequin designs on navy linen blazers with flowing 
ivory silk crepe pants or skirts are a good option out of the 
collection for an informal dinner party the lovely pleated and 
tucked black or navy chiffon dresses cant be faulted for safe but 
excellent chic 
the loveliest evening clothes were gossamerlight white chiffons 
with appliqued flowers on the billowing skirts and pearl edging 
around the fitted sleeveless bodices 
sonia rykiel the sweater queen showed both long and short 
looks the newest sweater was a shortie pullover teamed with wide 
pyjama pants or narrow skirts flared at the knee 
among her most remarkable looks were suspendered shorts with 
widely striped shirts in a collection that had a more youthful 
touch than usual the evening shorts were flippant fun too cut 
cool and full in filmy chiffon with embroidered jackets to match

soviet flotillas churned toward barrow to 
offer help for two trapped whales as rescuers tried to lure the 
mammals to freedom but biologists said they may have to airlift 
the animals to open water 
were having a net built right now to carry them david 
withrow of the national oceanic and atmospheric administrations 
marine mammal laboratory in seattle said sunday 
he emphasized that an airlift was the least preferred 
alternative to be used only if rescuers fail to coax the 
california gray whales to open water though a series of freshly cut 
air holes in the ice 
a third whale the smallest and the youngest of the mammals 
trapped in moving ice more than two weeks ago before they could 
migrate south disappeared friday and was presumed dead 
a pontoonmounted ice auger known as an archimedes screw tractor 
was delivered during the weekend by a huge air force c5a cargo 
plane and was reassembled sunday 
the device was to begin work today on the outside edge of an ice 
pressure ridge that stands between the whales and freedom 
thats the next big project for us said noaa biologist ron 
morris coordinator of the rescue 
noaa asked the soviet union for help and americas arctic 
neighbor ordered the icebreakers admiral makarov and vladimir 
arseniev to barrow said noaa rear adm sigmund r petersen 
director of the pacific marine center in seattle 
the ships were 140 nautical miles from the barrow area the 
soviet news agency tass reported today 
another flotilla unloaded equipment for a soviet station at the 
north pole before heading immediately for alaska tass said tass 
did not saw how many ships were in the second group 
the icebreakers are expected to arrive tuesday afternoon col 
tom carroll of the alaska national guard which is taking part in 
the rescue effort said on abcs good morning america today 
in washington today state department spokesman charles redman 
said the admiral makarov could arrive as early as tonight 
it was unclear what good the icebreakers could do in the shallow 
water near the whales the ships need 39 feet of water to operate 
tass said and the whales were trapped in water 12 to 25 feet deep 
even if the icebreakers cannot reach the whales the ships could 
help clear a path to open water about 200 miles away petersen said 
as hightech heavy equipment poured into this whaling village 
during the weekend eskimos used chain saws and muscle to make the 
most progress toward freeing the animals 
were marching out to the lead with inupiat eskimo power 
said morris the whales are responding to the holes 
the breathing holes extend more than 1 miles from where the 
whales were first trapped 
the eskimos connected several holes converting them into a 
narrow pool 250 feet long to give the whales more room to rest 
they made a similar slot in the ice over a shoal about 5 feet deep 
the shoal apparently deterred the whales from moving farther toward 
open water 
the whales appeared to be in good health although a patch of 
skin torn off one animals snout appeared to be worsening said jim 
harvey withrows colleague 
biologists believe a bone infection may have contributed to the 
death of the smallest whale which had been named bone 
the surviving whales were named crossbeak and bonnet by 
biologists eskimos have named the survivors siku or ice and 
putu or ice hole the vanished whale was named knik or snowflake 
wind continued blowing from a more northerly direction sunday 
threatening to close the lead in the ice that rescuers were trying 
to move the whales to 
the airlift will have to be considered if the pressure ridge 
cannot be breached biologists said 
its been done numerous times with killer whales and the 
like harvey said as he and withrow tried to accurately measure 
the whales lenghth 
the whales were estimated at 27 to 35 feet long the smaller a 
yearling and the other 2 to 3 years old withrow said 
getting them in the net will be tricky withrow said 
the icebreakers were dispatched under a 1976 cooperative 
environmental agreement with the soviets noaa spokesman brian 
gorman said in washington dc 
noaa provided satellite photographs of polar ice to the soviets 
to help them map a route to barrow the northernmost community in 
the united states gorman said

jailed black leader nelson 
mandela is making steady progress as he recovers from 
tuberculosis and has resumed his normal exercise routine a doctor 
said monday 
the 70yearold leader of the outlawed african national congress 
guerrilla movement was taken from pollsmoor prison in cape town to 
nearby tygerberg hospital on aug 12 to be treated for tb he was 
moved to cape towns constantiaberg clinic on aug 31 where he 
continues to recuperate 
since my last visit on sept 13 mr mandela has shown steady 
progress said dr jg strauss superintendent of tygerberg 
his weight is back to normal and mr mandela is once again 
following his usual routine of physical exercise relaxation and 
intellectual activities to which he was used to prior to his 
illness strauss said 
strauss did not elaborate and gave no indication of how long he 
expected mandela to remain in the clinic 
mandela has been imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life 
sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government 
there has been widespread speculation in south africa that 
mandela could be released in coming months 
his extended stay at the private clinic is widely seen as an 
interim measure while the government decides whether to free him or 
send him back to prison 
however mandelas wife winnie said after meeting with her 
husband on oct 15 all the rumors about his release are sheer 
rumors 
government officials are wary that his release could spark a new 
outbreak of black militancy and unrest but they also perceive that 
freeing mandela could ease international pressure on south africa 
president pw botha who says he is considering mandelas 
release has said mandela will be freed if he renounces violence 
mandela has refused saying he will do so only if apartheid is 
dismantled and the anc is legalized

the berkeley city council with a 
reputation for breaking new ground is about to consider a labor 
bill of rights that bans preemployment drug testing and limits 
police involvement in strikes 
a representative of the business community says the 
farreaching nineitem proposal is yet another attempt by berkeley 
politicians to grab some headlines by drafting policy that if 
approved will end up in court 
the city council which has attracted attention by passing 
measures on everything from foreign affairs to commercial rent 
control established a ninemember labor commission three years 
ago in what one member calls an example of berkeleys vision 
part of its mandate was the drafting of the bill of rights which 
will be the subject of a hearing before the council tuesday 
we want to set up a partnership of working people the city 
and business people talking about how we can have a stable driven 
economy in berkeley said mayor loni hancock 
although some of it is patterned after ordinances elsewhere 
like a prevailing wage provision for the construction industry that 
resembles a measure in neighboring oakland much of the proposal is 
classic berkeley 
one element would forbid the city to sign a contract with any 
employer involved in an officially sanctioned managementlabor 
dispute or which appears on the aflcio do not patronize list 
the provision would be building on the tradition the city has 
rather than be something wild and radical which its not 
according to kathy labriola vice chairman of the commission 
the city with a popularist tradition rooted in the 1960s 
counterculture that flourished at its university already has 
formally endorsed the united farm workers grape boycott it 
refuses to pay for city employees to travel to states that have not 
endorsed the equal rights amendment and boycotts products made in 
south africa as well as companies that do business in the racially 
segregated country 
another provision of the bill of rights would instruct police to 
remain neutral in labor disputes preventing officers from 
escorting strikebreakers across picket lines or attacking 
harassing or intimidating strikers 
employers would be required when lawful and feasible to 
give 12 months notice of plant closures and to meet with city and 
employee representatives to help avoid shutdowns 
and the proposal would expand an informal city directive by 
requiring where possible developers who build new nonresidential 
structures over 15000 square feet to provide onsite child care 
for workers or to pay into a city childcare fund 
other provisions would make it policy to promote full employment 
for berkeley residents encourage local ownership of property and 
businesses by residents and workers and foster union participation 
in high quality job creation efforts 
the statement endorses a proposal to help the citys 
approximately 13000 disabled residents find jobs and also urges 
the school district to develop a labororiented curriculum 
commissioners have tried to insulate the bill from legal 
challenges by sprinkling clauses like when lawful and feasible 
throughout 
jeff casey executive director of the berkeley chamber of 
commerce said business people are just sort of turned off by the 
whole process of working with the labor commission which he 
described as stacked with all union reps 
the chamber which is working with the citys office of economic 
development to attract business is not planning to fight the bill 
of rights because casey believes it would not be enforceable 
if we really thought it would impact business or drive people 
out of town he said wed stand up and fight it

republican nominee george bush today 
rejected democratic charges that his campaign advertising is racist 
in stressing the case of willie horton jr a black convicted 
murderer who raped a white woman after escaping from a 
massachusetts prison furlough 
the vice president responded to charges from sen lloyd bentsen 
the rev jesse jackson and others as he flew to new england for a 
daylong campaign tour aimed at making trouble for democratic 
nominee michael dukakis in his own territory 
there isnt any racism bush told reporters on air force 
two its absolutely ridiculous and everybody sees this as some 
desperation kind of move basing it on one ad 
the democrats had accused the gop nominee of inflaming racial 
fears by emphasizing the horton case which has been a favorite 
bush theme in speeches and television commercials charging that 
dukakis is soft on crime 
a republican party campaign flier mailed recently to several 
hundred thousand new yorkers featured a photograph of horton who 
now is imprisoned in maryland where the womans rape and the 
slashing of her fiance occurred 
i stand fully behind these ads and at the last minute those 
ads have been on a long long time for some concerted effort with 
all these people going out saying the same thing i mean people see 
this for what it is a campaign tactic i stand 100 percent behind 
those ads i think the american people are smart bush said 
he tried to turn the attack against dukakis by noting that the 
democrats are running an ad about a man from a halfway house in 
bushs hometown of houston who murdered a ministers wife bush was 
a supporter of the halfway house 
what about their ad about the halfway house is that racism 
against hispanics bush asked 
the racism charges were termed totally absurd by gop vice 
presidential candidate dan quayle during a flight to missouri i 
think it shows just how desperate they really are to start fanning 
the fires of racism in this country quayle said 
later at a rainswept rally outside portland city hall in 
maine bush was heckled by several hundred dukakis supporters who 
chanted no more lies 
i dont blame these people bush said if i had a 
candidate like that who went around the united states telling 
everybody how bad everything was id try to yell a little bit 
too 
arriving in waterbury bush told an airport crowd that we are 
not going to be deterred by the negative attacks coming out of the 
other side 
in the closing days of the campaign he said im going to run 
like im 10 points back all across this country 
the theme of the day was economics and bush lambasted dukakis 
in a speech prepared for delivery before a group of business 
leaders 
my opponent now wants to turn back to clog up the circulatory 
system of americas economy with exactly the kind of big government 
schemes the europeans are discarding the vice president said 
economists call the resulting economic paralysis 
eurosclerosis i call it dukakonomics it rhymes with 
carternomics it didnt work then and it wont work now 
to dukakis complaint that gop campaign ads are full of 
lies bush retorted that the massachusetts governor had lied 
about his record he is upset not because its false but 
because he is weak on crime and defense and thats the inescapable 
truth bush said 
going into the home stretch of the presidential race bush 
headed for rallies today in waterbury conn portland maine and 
burlington vt as he began a final nonstop stretch of 
campaigning that will take him to california and back to washington 
press aide mark goodin said the trip marks the start of 15 
straight days of campaigning with no more breaks until the nov 8 
election 
confident that his political base in the souh and rocky mountain 
states is secure bush is trying to harass dukakis in his region 
none of the states on todays itinerary packs many of the 
electoral votes needed to win the white house of the 270 needed 
for victory connecticut offers only eight maine has four and 
vermont has three 
however bushs strategists consider it a good investment of 
time because it could weaken dukakis on his home turf and force him 
to devote time and resources in an area that should belong to him 
with dukakis trailing in the polls hes got to fight a 
multifront war said goodin the spokesman for bush he needs 
every vote at this point 
its now a strategy of locking him out said goodin were 
taking his base away from him 
goodin said polls show bush is ahead in connecticut maine and 
vermont 
eyeing the most politically important state in the northeast 
goodin said bush is down in new york four to six points but is 
extremely competitive in a state once regarded safe for dukakis 
bush has spent only one day in new york and spent virtually no 
money there goodin said 
we may yet go in again if we can take it away or at least 
make him fight for it goodin said 
after todays trip bush will return to washington for the 
night setting out tuesday for ohio with stops in columbus akron 
and lima and an overnight in detroit 
bush will spend wednesday in michigan south dakota and montana 
thursday in washington state and california friday in california 
and nebraska and saturday in illinois

with the smell of burning cedar filling 
the hall hundreds of delegates from as far away as alaska and 
north carolina gathered monday for the opening of the national 
congress of american indians 
i think well have a good turnout because its an election 
year said john blackhawk chairman of the winnebago tribe of 
nebraska which is host for the gathering 
the group opened the weeklong meeting by burning cedar to purify 
the hall and by singing a traditional prayer song in which they 
asked the nations leaders to listen to indian concerns 
we need to take an overall view of indian country and the 
problems that we need to address said john f gonzales chairman 
of the congress in some peoples minds the organization has lost 
sight of what we should be focusing our efforts on 
gonzales called for unity from the more than 300 tribes 
represented in the group which is one of the nations oldest and 
largest indian organizations 
rep ben nighthorse campbell dcolo a cheyenne indian spoke 
to the group monday 
he said indians can no longer rely on the bureau of indian 
affairs to carry their concerns to washington 
its a heck of a lot easier to make change on the inside than 
on the outside he said indians must get involved in the 
political process 
the congress is expected to formulate positions on issues 
ranging from hunting and fishing to treaty rights and aids which 
will be presented to the next president of the united states

michael dukakis today accused republican 
rival george bush of waging a campaign of outright lies and 
turning his back on average americans with a plan to give a huge 
tax break to himself and other wealthy people 
the democratic nominee told a rally of supporters that he like 
the world series champion los angeles dodgers was headed toward 
an upset victory in the nov 8 election 
dukakis said the bush campaign was based on distortions and 
misrepresentations of his record as massachusetts governor he 
promised to take my case directly to you in the two remaining 
weeks of the presidential campaign 
you know mark twain once said that a lie can travel half way 
around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes 
dukakis told the rally at the outset of a full day of campaigning 
in california 
mr bush must have read mark twain dukakis said because 
hes running a campaign based on distortions and distractions and 
outright lies why because he cant win an election where the real 
issues are discussed the real challenges are faced and the real 
differences are made known 
campaigning as an underdog populist dukakis criticized the vice 
presidents proposal for a capital gains tax credit which dukakis 
said would give bush an annual tax break of 22000 
george bush wants to give people like george bush a tax break 
thats more than the average california worker makes in a year 
dukakis said look beside you look behind you look in the 
mirror and ask yourself is george bush on your side 
responding in a speech at portland maine the vice president 
said i will push for a cut in the capital gains tax for a very 
simple reason its not to favor the rich it will help create 
jobs 
my opponent calls this typically a tax cut for the rich 
bush said hes wrong hes dead wrong 
the democratic nominee told a boisterous rally on his arrival 
sunday night at burbank calif that bushs disavowal of a gop 
campaign brochure fell far short of what was need to restore the 
proper tone to the contest the brochure said murderers and rapists 
supported dukakis 
when you put garbage out in the street youve got a 
responsibility to clean it up dukakis told the cheering 
supporters at the burbank airport 
dukakis said bush and his fellow republicans have resorted to 
distortions and misrepresentations outright lying because they 
dont want to deal with the real issues and real challenges that 
face our nation 
the massachusetts governor invoked the los angeles dodgers the 
underdog winners last week of the baseball world series in 
promising an election day upset 
you know and i know the dodgers werent supposed to win 
either dukakis said yeah were a little bit behind but 
were fighting back 
dukakis was spending all of today in california the biggest 
electoral college prize with 47 votes beginning his day by meeting 
with supporters and members of the asianamerican community of los 
angeles 
he arrived here after a flight from boston that included a 
refueling stop in eau claire wis where dukakis addressed a rally 
of about 600 people gathered on a chilly night inside a hangar 
there he began a new campaign week essentially where he left off 
last week assailing the tone of the republican campaign 
dukakis said bush has distorted his record and positions on 
several issues and for the first time he raised bushs disavowal of 
the illinois campaign brochure 
disavowal isnt enough said dukakis who last week referred 
to the brochure as garbage 
lets get that stuff out of this campaign dukakis said 
dukakis whose new campaign commercials denounce gop distortions 
of his positions said bush has wrongly told farmstate audiences 
the democratic ticket supports an embargo on grain sales to the 
soviet union 
we dont dukakis said we never have we never will he 
knows that 
dukakis also singled out gun control and accused both bush and 
the national rifle association of distorting his views 
ive always supported the rights of hunters and sportsmen to 
have weapons and to use them dukakis said adding that his major 
concern was the availability of handguns and automatic weapons to 
innercity children 
dukakis urged those at the rally to set the record straight 
among your neighbors and friends 
dukakis continuing an effort he began last week planned to 
keep a high television profile in the two weeks leading to the 
election he was appearing tonight on larry kings talk show on the 
cable news network and for 90 minutes tuesday on abcs 
nightline 
he also has purchased fiveminute slots on the networks this 
tuesday sunday nov 1 and nov 5 as well as a halfhour on the 
three major broadcast networks on election eve 
meanwhile aides accused bush of allowing racist appeals to 
permeate his campaign message specifically in his attack on a 
massachusetts furlough program that granted a weekend pass to a 
murderer who escaped and raped a maryland woman the inmate is 
black the victim white 
flying to connecticut this morning for a campaign tour of new 
england the vice president asserted that there isnt any 
racism in his tv ads about horton and said the democrats were 
merely engaged in desperation tactics 
dukakis running mate texas sen lloyd bentsen said sunday he 
believed there were racist appeals in the bush message 
campaign vice chairman john sasso told reporters dukakis agreed 
with bentsen dukakis himself refused to answer when asked if he 
agreed with his running mate offering only a shrug 
dukakis aides seeking to bolster their case distributed copies 
of an atlanta constitution column in which a bush aide is quoted as 
saying of dukakis 
we are going to show he is so far left hes to the left of 
collard greens blackeyed peas and striprow cotton the quote 
was attributed to chris henick bushs southern regional director

confederate sergeant who died in 1909 it was found this spring 
buried in a flower garden in saginaw mich 
officials have no idea how the the tombstone got to michigan but 
speculate that a tourist took it from a tampa cemetery as a 
souvenir in the 1920s 
the silence of the oak and magnoliashaded evergreen cemetery 
was shattered sunday by a 21gun salute from a troop of 
grayuniformed confederate reenactment soldiers 
several of houstons descendants were visibly moved when a man 
portraying a union army bugler played taps in tribute 
it was fantastic all the people who helped us who didnt know 
us there is no way we can thank them all because there were so 
many it shows that there is still a lot of decency out there 
said hans huntsinger houstons great grandson 
houston died in tampa and is buried there but there is no 
record of the exact location relatives decided to place houstons 
tombstone beside that of his widow mary draper houston who died 
in 1950

the father of the chief prosecution witness in 
the bess myerson divorcefixing case says neither he nor his wife 
has asked their daughter why she agreed to testify when her own 
mother is one of the defendants 
sukhreet gabel 39 allegedly was used by miss myerson to get to 
her mother former justice hortense gabel mrs gabel was handling 
the divorce case of miss myersons boyfriend carl capasso all 
three are defendants in the bribery conspiracy case in federal 
court 
the prosecution maintains that miss myerson a former miss 
america who was city cultural affairs commissioner hired the 
daughter in 1983 and that in return mrs gabel reduced capassos 
alimony 
in addition to testifying for the prosecution ms gabel taped a 
telephone conversation with her mother for investigators and handed 
over documents belonging to her mother 
neither of us have asked her anything milton gabel was 
quoted as telling columnist cindy adams in mondays new york post 
its very strange that sukhreet did this how can you raise a 
daughter all your life and then accept that she can do this 
ms gabel 39 lives on an allowance from her parents and will 
come into money under her mothers will gabel said 
shes our daughter but shes always done odd things gabel 
a dentist said 
asked if he loved his daughter he said i have a harder time 
with that than my wife does 
sukhreet is brilliant but shes always been odd i guess its 
sort of a mental thing like after she graduated from the un 
school she wanted to just travel around the world and do nothing 
for two years she almost never seems to work 
ms gabel had been jobhunting 18 months when myerson gave her a 
19000ayear job to be what the witness has described as a 
glorified gofer 
gabel said that although his daughter lives a block away she 
did not visit her parents until the conspiracy case began to unfold 
she never came near us he said she never invited us she 
never made dinner for us 
still were supporting her he said hortys pension and 
social security is divided with sukhreet and well continue to 
support her shes our child 
mrs gabel 75 retired from the bench last year citing poor 
health 
the post said the daughters allowance from her parents is 
1700 a month 
ms gabel named julie at birth became enamored of things 
indian after she dropped out of school at age 16 and took a job at 
the india pavilion of the new york worlds fair she changed her 
name to sukhreet dyed her fair hair black and adopted indian dress 
her marriage in 1975 to dutch diplomat jan revis ended in 
divorce

the indpendent peace association the democratic initiative the 
czech children and the society for friendship with the united

provisions cited for the ban were inapplicable they also made 
clear they will go ahead with fridays demonstration despite the 
official ban

sen dan quayle said monday it is totally 
absurd for democrats to suggest that the republican are making 
racist appeals in the presidential campaign 
gop nominee george bushs vice presidential running mate labeled 
the allegations a political diversionary tactic 
quayle said the charges by his democratic counterpart lloyd 
bentsen and by the rev jesse jackson and others reflected 
desperation among supporters of the flagging candidacy of 
democratic nominee michael dukakis 
its totally absurd i think it shows just how desperate they 
really are to start fanning the fires of racism in this country 
its totally unfounded quayle told reporters aboard his campaign 
plane as he flew from washington to missouri 
bentsen and jackson alleged last weekend that the bush campaign 
was sending a racial message by hammering dukakis over the case of 
black convicted murderer willie horton jr who raped a white woman 
in maryland last year after he had escaped from a massachusetts 
prison furlough 
our opponents have begun a massive campaign of disinformation 
a concerted effort to divert this campaign away from the issues 
that george bush and i have raised quayle told a rally at fox 
senior high school in this small town outside st louis 
if i had to defend the dukakis record id look for 
diversions too the indiana senator said 
quayle attacked what he called the massachusetts governors 
pathetic positions in the area of national defense and crime 
when reporters asked about jacksons contention that the 
republicans are using the word liberal to refer negatively to civil 
rights activists quayle replied tthats absolutely absurd to 
say that liberal has some sort of racial connotation liberalism is 
a political philosophy 
stumping for votes in missouri a state with 11 electoral votes 
where the presidential race is considered close quayle accused 
dukakis of being afraid of sharing his true ideology wih the 
voters of america 
after his speech quayle walked up and down the aisles of the 
crowded high school auditorium taking questions from the students 
after stating his firm opposition to abortion quayle was asked 
if he would feel the same way if his wife had been raped and become 
pregnant 
quayle paused only slightly before saying the decision would be 
left to his wife marilyn although he hoped she would avoid an 
abortion 
if that situation happened which would be tragic it would be 
tough not only on marilyn but tough on me and tough on our 
children but if that happened i would think that she would and i 
would hope she would have as tough as it may be have the child 
rather than the abortion 
replying to another student quayle said he would do again 
exactly what i did when he joined the indiana national guard 
rather than fight in vietnam 
quayle planned two other campaign stops in missouri which he 
called a tossup state before flying to kentucky 
one scheduled appearance was to tour a job training partnership 
act program in union mo quayle cites his sponsorship of the job 
training legislation as one of his chief legislative 
accomplishments

islamic jihad a proiranian group 
holding two us hostages said monday it was not linked to the 
lebanese woman arrested in italy with photographs of captive 
americans 
the group claimed the woman aline ibrahim rizkallah 36 had 
ties to israels secret service 
islamic jihad challenged italian authorities to publish a 
photograph of american hostage terry anderson that was found in the 
womans luggage at milan airport last thursday 
what has been said about about the presence of a photograph of 
captive anderson is sheer fabrication and is absolutely devoid of 
truth islamic jihad said in a typewritten arabiclanguage 
statement delivered to a western news agency in beirut 
the 15line communique was delivered with an photograph of 
anderson to authenticate it 
the kidnappers apparently did not know that authorities in milan 
had already released a copy of the photograph of anderson that was 
discovered in the womans luggage 
we hold italian authorities fully responsible for 
collaborating in a malicious conspiracy aimed at besmirching our 
image in the eyes of public opinion this will not go unpunished 
the islamic jihad statement said 
milan police said two other photographs at least one of them 
showing another american captive alann steen were found in the 
womans luggage along with a letter bearing steens name 1000 in 
counterfeit bills and 17 ounces of heroin 
the statement today was the third in recent days from islamic 
jihad which holds associated press correspondent terry anderson 
and educator thomas sutherland 
anderson and sutherland are among nine americans held by 
proiranian groups in lebanon anderson kidnapped march 16 1985 
is the longest held hostage

the embattled mother superior of a 
carmelite monastery said monday there will be no more attempts to 
persuade five rebel nuns to end nearly three weeks of isolation in 
the infirmary 
the five cloistered nuns locked themselves in the infirmary oct 
4 to forestall eviction by the diocese of paterson which has since 
accused the sisters of being disobedient the nuns oppose attempts 
by their prioress mother teresa hewitt to modernize life at the 
13member community by introducing such things as television radio 
and candy 
the five have vowed not to end their vigil until they hear 
directly from the vatican where the sisters have appealed the 
dioceses order that they vacate the monastery 
on monday mother teresa broke four days of silence by issuing a 
statement that said there will be no more news on the issue of 
carmel of morristown until a decision is sent to us by the 
vatican 
the prioress and the five sisters agreed last thursday to 
observe a period of prayer and reflection over the weekend after 
two and a half weeks of intense scrutiny from reporters from as far 
away as italy

prosecutors showed a videotape of a 
1985 fatal soccer riot monday at the trial of 26 britons charged 
with involuntary manslaughter in the clash 
the 60minute tape showed rioting british fans tearing down a 
flimsy fence and charging italian supporters before a championship 
match at heysel stadium thirtynine people were killed and more 
than 500 were injured 
judge pierre verlynde later adjourned the proceedings for two 
days to study a defense motion to read aloud the prosecutions 
48000page file of charges and supporting evidence at the trial if 
they do not get a free copy of the file 
the reading could delay the trial for months officials said 
only two of the 26 british defendants showed up monday verlynde 
angered defense lawyers when he declined to hear arguments from 
those lawyers whose clients were absent some defense lawyers 
briefly threatened to walk out 
on sept 18 the court let 14 defendants go home but they were 
due to return monday two other defendants are in jail in britain 
on unrelated charges 
defense lawyers acknowledged that the demand to read the bulky 
file made little sense but they said they needed a free copy so 
they could study it 
the court provides a copy of the file but does not permit the 
defense lawyers to take it home 
verlynde said the defense based its argument on a rule put into 
effect when many defendants were still illiterate 
but the defense contended the britons who do not speak french 
fell under such a ruling the trial which began oct 17 is 
conducted in french 
the british defendants face up to 10 years in jail if convicted 
two belgian police officers and a former belgian soccer 
federation chairman also are on trial accused of providing lax 
security at the 1985 european cup soccer final between liverpool 
and juventus turin of italy 
the belgian defendants face up to two years in jail 
the tv footage of the riots led to the extradition of 26 britons 
last year it showed british fans charging into the neighboring 
stand and beginning the fatal stampede 
english soccer clubs have been banned competing in europes 
three main cup tournaments since the riot

supreme court justice sandra day oconnor was 
reported in good condition monday at georgetown university hospital 
recovering from surgery for breast cancer 
but while officials at the hospital and the court said the 
58yearold justices condition was good they would not provide 
any details about the nature of her surgery which took place 
friday or her postoperative treatment normally breast cancer 
patients receive some treatment such as chemotherapy or radiation 
to prevent a recurrence 
the los angeles times reported saturday that oconnor underwent 
a mastectomy removal of the breast rather than removal of just a 
malignant tumor called a lumpectomy 
dr christine berg a cancer specialist at georgetown university 
medical school told the newspaper she was familiar with the case 
and that oconnor had a mastectomy 
her tumor was more extensive than could be handled by a 
lumpectomy alone dr berg was quoted as saying 
dr berg who did not take part in performing the surgery told 
the associated press on monday she could not confirm that the 
operation was a mastectomy im not 100 percent certain she 
said 
the hospital also declined to say whether lymph nodes were 
removed from under oconnors arm in the surgery and what test 
results if any from the nodes were available 
the national cancer institute says the fiveyear survival rate 
for breast cancer patients whose cancer is confined to the breast 
is greater than 85 percent if the cancer has spread to the lymph 
nodes the survival rate drops to 70 percent or less 
dr robert s siegel director of cancer treatment at george 
washington university hospital said in an interview that typically 
the lymph glands are removed whether the patient undergoes a 
mastectomy or lumpectomy 
oconnor released an earlier statement that said she intends to 
be back at the supreme court on oct 31 when the justices return 
from a twoweek recess to resume hearing oral arguments 
she already was doing some work from her hospital room 
she issued an order monday temporarily shielding goodyear tire amp 
rubber co from having to pay a 4 million damage award to a 
minnesota service station attendant injured by an exploding tire 
oconnor granted an emergency request by goodyear to extend a 
lower court order permitting the company to withhold the money 
pending action by the full supreme court on a formal goodyear 
appeal

insurgencies karens represent about 2 million of burmas 38

the rebels in midoctober 
last week a series of clashes with rebels in the state of 
kachin in northern burma claimed the lives of 17 soldiers wounding 
23 others kyaw sann said 
on oct 18 seven rebels were killed in battles that began when 
the kachins one of the guerrilla groups that have fought the 
central government for decades attacked a police outpost in myo 
thit about 500 miles north of rangoon 
the government suffered its heaviest casualties when rebels in 
kachin ambushed a government convoy near myo thit killing 15 
soldiers

moslem guerrillas said monday they 
captured a provincial capital in northeastern afghanistan their 
fifth since the start of the soviet withdrawal in may 
there was no independent confirmation 
the afghan news agency operated by the hezbiislami 
guerrillas said mahmudiraqi 33 miles north of the afghan 
capital of kabul fell to its fighters sunday 
the guerrillas claimed mahmudiraqi fell after two days of 
intense fighting in which about 100 afghan government soldiers were 
killed and 83 were captured it claimed only four guerrillas were 
wounded 
the province has long been reported the domain of the rival 
jamiatiislami group which has kept the capital under siege 
this is the first i heard of it said jamiat spokesman basir 
from his peshawar pakistan headquarters 
hezbiislami said guerrillas destroyed 21 tanks and captured 
three it also captured trucks and light and heavy weapons 
western diplomats previously confirmed the guerrilla takeovers 
of kunar and paktika provinces in the east takhar in the north and 
bamyan in central afghanistan all had been abandoned by 
withdrawing soviet troops guerrillas said 
also monday jamiat leader burhanuddin rabbani criticized un 
mediator diego cordovez for alleging guerrilla disunity and calling 
for the formation of an afghan government including communists and 
moslem guerrillas 
cordovez allows himself to interfere in the domestic affairs 
of afghanistan and to request certain individuals to form or help 
to form the future government of afghanistan said rabbani 
chairman of the sevenparty guerrilla alliance in a statement to 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
we also wonder how mr cordovez gives himself the right to 
interfere in our affairs while he himself stated that only the 
afghans can decide their future the message said 
cordovez mediated the unsponsored accord last spring in which 
moscow agreed to withdraw its more than 100000 troops from 
afghanistan between may 15 and feb 15 1989 
the guerrillas not a party to the negotiations have rejected 
the accord although they have scored a string of victories against 
government troops since the pullout began 
guerrilla leaders repeatedly have rejected suggestions of 
sharing power with the marxist government of president najib 
the governing peoples democratic party of afghanistan seized 
power in a bloody 1978 coup soviet troops intervened in december 
1979 and have been fighting the usbacked guerrillas ever since

a steellined boxcar of lowlevel radioactive 
waste returned to the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant monday 
after being rejected by idaho leaving in its tracks troubling 
questions about how the nation handles its atomic leftovers 
the boxcar ordered out of idaho by gov cecil andrus on 
saturday was shunted to a siding at the rocky flats plant 16 miles 
northwest of denver on monday morning while officials debated what 
to do 
colorado gov roy romer on sunday turned down a department of 
energy request to expand storage facilities for lowlevel 
radioactive waste at rocky flats and asked that the department of 
energy not unload the rail car which contains 140 drums of waste 
at 55 gallons per drum 
the state now allows storage of up to 1600 cubic yards of 
radioactive waste at rocky flats and the plant legally could 
accommodate the boxcars cargo without exceeding the limit 
officials said 
well cooperate with the doe to find an alternative site until 
a proposed disposal facility in new mexico is open romer said 
monday but ive said look no expansion of rocky flats 
romer said he would press for a meeting of western governors to 
discuss a longterm solution to the problem and planned to talk to 
doe officials in the meantime 
it was the second time recently that rocky flats operations 
have come under the spotlight earlier this month the plants 
plutonium reprocessing facility was closed by the doe after three 
workers were exposed to radioactive material inside building 771 
remains closed but production of plutonium triggers for nuclear 
weapons continues at the plant officials said 
andrus put the idaho national engineering laboratory offlimits 
to further radioactive waste disposal last week to hasten does 
opening of the waste isolation pilot plant near carlsbad nm 
if they cant handle the waste they shouldnt be generating 
it andrus said monday on cbstvs this morning program 
they wont be shipping it into idaho 
there was no indication how long the boxcar might have to sit at 
rocky flats a position hasnt been defined yet said doe 
spokesman ben mccarty in a telephone interview from albuquerque 
nm 
the washington state governors office issued a statement monday 
that said the boxcar would be accepted at the hanford nuclear 
reservation in eastern washington well accept the waste if it 
gets this far said dick milne press secretary for gov booth 
gardner we just dont believe it would be safe to let the waste 
continue to sit in the boxcar 
romers office had no immediate response to the offer 
although the radioactive material in the boxcar is stored in 
specially lined steel drums considered safe to handle longtime 
critics of rocky flats expressed concern 
ive got to tell you its unacceptable to have this 
transuranic waste sitting in a rail car said jan pilcher a 
spokeswoman for the american friends service committee a 
persistent critic of rocky flats for the past decade hes 
romer got to press to have this removed the least viable option 
is to have this sitting in a rail car 
the wipp facility in new mexico was to be the longterm answer 
to the problem said ed heintz director of communications for 
rockwell international which operates rocky flats for the doe 
congress failure to pass land transfer legislation this year 
forced the energy department to scrap the scheduled october opening 
date for wipp and the facility probably wont open until early 
next year radioactive wastes would be buried 2000 feet 
underground in salt deposits at the site 
with andrus refusal to allow further radioactive waste 
shipments to idaho there now is no central disposal site for 
wastes produced by 10 facilities in the nations nuclear weapons 
production system said mccarty 
idaho was the only central storage site that accepted waste 
from other places he said 
idaho officials said rocky flats was the chief shipper of 
lowlevel radioactive wastes to the idaho national engineering 
laboratory site in idaho falls for the last 20 years rocky flats 
shipped an average of 55 boxcars of waste to idaho annually the 
waste is a mix of contaminated rags machine parts gloves liquids 
and other debris 
the argonne national laboratory near chicago the lawrence 
livermore laboratory near san francisco and the idaho national 
engineering laboratory itself were other waste contributors 
officials have said an estimated 2 million cubic feet of the waste 
is stored below ground and 24 million cubic feet is in steel 
barrels on aboveground pads at the idaho facility officials have 
said 
mccarty said the plants now will have to store their radioactive 
waste onsite as do the other six plants in the nuclear weapons 
network until the wipp facility can open 
he said that in addition to congressional approval of 
legislation transferring the land from the bureau of land managment 
to the doe approval is needed by the nuclear regulatory commission 
of the trupact ii container in which the wastes would be placed 
and he said the state of new mexico must change its laws so that 
the small amount of chemical hazardous waste that also would be 
stored at wipp would be accounted for legally

the state had asked a hunter to kill the two cows and one calf 
stuck on a 12foot by 80foot ledge six feet below the top of a 
cliff 
wildlife officers accompanied the hunter to disappointment

was unable to get into position to shoot the elk 
a wildlife division officer shot two of the elk and the other 
fell off the ledge said mike zgainer of the wildlife division 
office in durango 
the elk were beginning to show the effects of hunger by late in 
the week 
the stranded elk were reported early last week shortly after 
elk season opened by a rancher who complained that the wildlife 
division planned to do nothing to rescue the three animals 
kip stransky of the wildlife division said that after the 
animals were killed the hunting party made a sling and lowered the 
carcasses from the ledge the meat will be donated to the county 
welfare department to help feed the poor

a prosecution witness described 
how one victims nearnude body was found just west of town as a 
preliminary hearing opened monday against a man linked by 
authorites to the i5 strangler killings 
el dorado county sheriffs detective jim watson also testified 
in the hearing for roger reece kibbe that the victim darcie 
frackenpohl 17 had been strangled 
the body of the victim a runaway from seattle was discovered 
by a jogger in september 1987 two to three weeks after she was 
killed 
kibbe 49 a former furniture maker and brother of a law 
enforcement officer in the area was arrested last april for 
investigation of the murder of ms frackenpohl 
sacramento county sheriff glen craig has described kibbe as a 
suspect in the other six murders believed part of the i5 
strangler series although no other charges have been filed in 
those cases 
the killings occurred between april 1986 and last may in the 
sacramento and stockton areas along interstate 5 and south of reno 
nev 
eighteen witnesses are scheduled to be called during the 
fourday preliminary hearing to determine whether kibbe should be 
bound over for trial 
watson said a search of the area just off us 50 below echo 
summit also turned up two packaged condoms a black highheeled 
shoe and the victims pink dress found about 1000 feet from the 
body 
also called as a witness was a 17yearold woman who said she 
had worked as a prostitute with the victim in west sacramento the 
witness also identified the victims pink dress 
when the preliminary hearing opened municipal court judge 
eugene rasmussen renewed his earlier ruling that no still or 
television cameras would be allowed during the session 
last june the judge had declined to allow cameras but rejected 
a defense motion to close the hearing 
the closure had been opposed by media representatives who said 
that in other alleged serial murder cases courts have held that 
public access is too important to bar reporters 
defense attorney phil kohn had argued kibbe couldnt get a fair 
trial and expressed concern about news accounts that tended to link 
kibbe to the other six murders 
kibbe was ordered to appear in a police lineup late this summer 
and as a result prosecutors said investigations in at least one 
of the other murders were underway even though no other charges 
have been filed 
prosecutors have said the other jurisdictions are all following 
the el dorado county proceeding to see if it will assist in their 
cases

gov james r thompson said monday hell withhold 
a decision on whether to pardon convicted rapist gary dotson until 
he can determine the scientific reliability of a test that cleared 
dotson of the 1977 attack 
the illinois prisoner review board was unanimous in recommending 
the pardon thompson said 
dotson was convicted of raping cathy crowell webb and was 
sentenced to serve a 25 to 50year prison term thompson in 1985 
commuted the sentence to time served after mrs webb recanted her 
testimony 
the governor said at the time he did not pardon doston because 
he did not believe mrs webbs recantation but thompson also said 
dotsons time in prison equalled that of other convicted rapists 
and called the release a gesture of mercy 
dotsons attorney thomas breen contends dotson deserves a 
full and complete pardon after the most recent test a kind of 
genetic fingerprinting performed by a california firm exonerated 
dotson

the administration told the senate that its 
refusal to allocate funds for a possible un peacekeeping force in 
southern africa may delay the pullout of 50000 cuban troops from 
angola it was disclosed monday 
the administration had sought permission from congress to 
transfer 150 million from a foreign aid account to a special fund 
for peacekeeping operations but the senate balked in the final 
hours of the 100th congress despite assurances friday from 
national security adviser colin powell that the united states would 
not abandon angolan rebel leader jonas savimbi 
the money was specifically intended to cover the us share in 
startup costs of a 7500member un force that would supervise a 
cuban pullout from angola and independence for neighboring 
southwestern africa known as namibia 
negotiations are at a stalemate over the timetable for a cuban 
pullout but the administration is hoping for a breakthrough that 
could come while congress is in recess the 100th congress 
adjourned on saturday and the 101st will not be sworn in until 
january 
so naturally were disappointed that the money for the 
peacekeeping force wasnt approved state department spokesman 
charles redman said we were hopeful that congress would have 
authorized this transfer given the importance to the united states 
of ongoing peacekeeping efforts in several regions of the world 
senate approval was blocked by supporters of savimbi whose 
unita organization has been receiving us help in its fight 
against the leftist angolan government 
the senators wanted assurances that savimbis future would be 
included in any package worked out between angola south africa and 
cuba with the mediation of the united states 
seeking to assuage those concerns powell wrote sen dennis 
deconcini dariz on friday assuring him the united states would 
not abandon savimbi until the angolan government includes him in a 
political settlement 
us support for the valiant unita has not and been and 
will not be a bargaining chip in the negotiations for cuban troop 
withdrawal from angola powell wrote 
he urged deconcini and his colleagues to approve funding for the 
peacekeeping force if there are insufficient funds cuban 
troop withdrawal will be delayed he added 
deconcini dropped his objections to the administrations request 
after reading powells oct 21 letter but other opponents were not 
swayed an aide to the senator said 
angola has rejected us urgings to discuss unitas role in a 
settlement saying the matter is an internal affair

a federal judge monday refused to bar from the nov 
8 ballot a referendum to declare english the states official 
language 
the ruling clears the way for florida to join arizona and 
colorado in posing official english ballot questions to voters 
us district judge james kehoe refused to grant an injunction 
sought by opponents of the measure saying the citizens initiative 
did not violate the 1965 voting rights act 
a spokeswoman for florida english which sponsored the 
initiative called the ruling a great relief but its opponents 
said an appeal was certain 
a class action with four spanishspeaking residents of dade 
county as the named plaintiffs was filed against the ballot 
proposal known as amendment 11 it contended that the proposal 
violated the federal voting rights acts because the petitions 
seeking to put it on the ballot were circulated only in english 
the states involvement in the petition process does not 
amount to state action triggering application of the voting rights 
act kehoe said in a sevenpage ruling 
while a petition initiative in florida is subject to state 
approval such approval must be granted so long as certain format 
requirements have been adhered to the judge ruled 
under a provision of the voting rights act election literature 
must be distributed in a second language in areas where more than 5 
percent of the population has limited knowledge of english that 
would include dade and five other counties collier dade hardee 
hendry hillsborough and monroe 
the suit was based on a colorado suit that persuaded a federal 
judge in denver last month to invalidate thousands of signatures in 
areas of colorado where petitions for a constitutional amendment 
making english that states official language were not circulated 
in spanish 
but one day after the florida suit was filed an appeals court 
in denver overturned the lower court decision 
kehoe noted in his final paragraph the court stresses that 
this decision in no way represents a judgment as to the merits of 
the constitutional amendment at issue rather the present ruling 
is limited to the narrow question of whether the petition to place 
the proposed amendment on the election ballot is subject to the 
language minority requirements of the voting rights act 
we were a private group not a government agency said pat 
fulton a spokeswoman for florida english it was really 
stretching federal law to try to apply the voting rights act 
the suits plaintiffs were backed by an organization named speak 
up now for florida 
my inclination is to appeal said donald middlebrooks an 
attorney for the plaintiffs i think the amendment is divisive to 
the community it is looked upon as antihispanic 
jeff browne statewide coordinator for speak up now for florida 
said there were excellent grounds for an appeal and that he was 
certain one would be filed 
we thought that at the trial court there was a very good 
chance it would go against us so were wellprepared for that 
he said by telephone from his washington office

the associated press bureau in beirut 
in the name of god the merciful the compassionate 
commenting on news agency dispatches about the presence of a 
picture of captive terry anderson with the socalled aline 
rizkallah who was arrested at milan airport it is important for 
us to emphasize the following 
1 what has been said about the presence of a photograph of 
captive anderson is sheer fabrication and is absolutely devoid of 
truth 
2 we demand that italian authorities pubish the picture of 
anderson to reveal the truth otherwise we hold italian authorities 
fully responsible for collaborating in a malicious conspiracy aimed 
at besmirching our image in the eyes of public opinion this will 
not go unpunished 
3 the political links of the socalled aline rizkallah to 
israeli secret agents and her drug trading or taking is clear proof 
that needs no corroboration of her uninvolvement in any matter 
related to us whatsoever 
4 we are awaiting the italian response so that we understand 
the truth of the matter and take the appropriate stand

conservation planning to protect highly 
erodible land has passed the halfway mark the agriculture 
department said monday 
wilson scaling chief of the departments soil conservation 
service said plans have been completed for 753 million acres or 
53 percent of the estimated 143 million acres of cropland needing 
plans 
the conservation planning was required by congress in the 1985 
farm law and scaling said the agencys goal is to have 65 percent 
of the plans completed by the end of 1988 and the remainder by the 
end of 1989 
we are right on target but i urge farmers to act now if they 
have highly erodible land that needs a conservation plan he said 
to remain eligible for usda programs including crop price 
supports and other benefits farmers and ranchers who operate 
highly erodible cropland must have a conservation plan approved by 
dec 31 1989 and they will have until the end of 1994 to put the 
plan into operation to date conservation plans have been 
implemented on 217 million acres or 15 percent 
the following shows progress as of oct 1 by states the first 
column shows the estimated number of acres of highly erodible land 
and the second is the percentage of acres for which plans have been

new interim rules restricting the use of pads 
and other devices to train tennessee walking horses and other 
gaited horses will take effect immediately to close a loophole in 
previously issued regulations the agriculture department announced 
monday 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service said the new rules will continue 
the present ban on the use of heel pads of more than one inch in 
yearling horses 
in a previous interim rule announced on july 26 the agency 
eliminated federal regulations that phased down the maximum pad 
height to one inch in place of that the agency ruled that pad 
height would be based on the length of a horses natural foot 
glosser said that under the july provisions the pad height on 
some horses may exceed one inch and that this could be injurious 
to yearlings he said the agency inadvertently retained language 
from the earlier rule that would have ended the limitation on pad 
height for yearling horses after oct 31 
he said a limit on the height of heel pads used on yearlings 
is necessary because the immature development of the young 
horses limbs makes higher pads potentially harmful to them 
therefore glosser said the agency is removing the language in 
the regulations that would have terminated this restriction after 
oct 31 
the usda agency administers the horse protection act of 1970 
which prohibits the practice of soring horses by using cruel 
methods devices or chemicals to cause them pain when walking 
soring is done primarily to alter a horses gait for the show ring

pilot error caused the fiery collision 
of three italian jets that killed 69 people at the us ramstein 
air base during an exhibition aug 28 an inquiry commission said 
monday 
one of the 10 jets in the show plunged into a crowd of about 
300000 people and exploded in flames after colliding with two of 
the planes all three pilots were among the dead 
the report issued by the west german defense ministry said the 
collision occurred when one of the pilots tried to fly through a 
formation made by the other planes 
the complex lowaltitude maneuvers such as the one attempted in 
ramstein involve two groups of four and five planes each the two 
groups fly past each other in opposite directions and then climb in 
single file in two finishing loops the 10th plane the soloist 
flies through the formation at a 90degree angle 
the report did not say what specific error or errors caused the 
collision 
the cause of the midair collision between the solo pilot and 
two other planes from the italian stunt flying team has been 
determined to have been human error by the solo pilot the report 
said 
the solo pilot was lt col ivo nutarelli 38 an experienced 
flyer who had logged 4250 hours of flying before the accident 
two days after the crash lt col diego raineri the commander 
of the stuntflying team who was coordinating the teams manuevers 
from the ground by radio said the solo plane entered the formation 
too low and too soon 
the commmission led by west german military flight safety 
authorities and including us and italian experts ruled out other 
possible causes of the disaster such as technical failure or 
collision with a flock of birds 
the commission has determined that there was no violation of 
safety regulations for air shows that are binding for nato member 
states the report said the organizer had fulfilled 
corresponding safety requirements and in part had even increased 
them 
however the commission recommended that north atlantic treaty 
organization member states make a critical reassessment of air 
shows in light of this tragic accident

an environmental group and a north carolina 
regional planning commission filed suit against the navy and 
defense department on monday attempting to stop further testing of 
a highpowered electrical generator that simulates one of the 
effects of a nuclear blast 
the suit which requests preliminary and permanent injunctions 
accuses the navy of starting tests of the empress ii generator off 
the north carolina coast this summer on the basis of a hopelessly 
premature and flawed environmental impact statement 
it accuses the navy of ignoring potential adverse effects on 
test workers and recreational or commercial boaters and fishermen 
as well as on marine life and the radio equipment of passing ships 
and planes 
empress ii poses a grave potential risk to the environment and 
public health and we intend to shut it down until the navy conforms 
with federal laws governing environmental safety said jeremy 
rifkin president of the foundation on economic trends an activist 
environmental group based in washington 
the foundation filed suit in us district court here with the 
albemarle commission a regional planning and development 
commission based in hertford nc that represents 24 local north 
carolina governments including currituck county 
the navys initial testing of empress ii occurred this summer in 
the waters of the atlantic ocean off the coast of currituck county 
just south of the virginia capes near the virginianorth carolina 
border 
the radiation emitted by empress ii presents hazards to the 
wellbeing of marine life and of human beings exposed to it 
including sailors fishermen tourists and others in the area 
subjected to such radiation the 19page lawsuit asserts 
the navy declined immediate comment on the suit lt cmdr craig 
quigley a navy spokesman said initial empress ii testing had been 
completed for the year and would not resume until next summer 
empress ii is a navy barge that has been fitted with two diesel 
generators and a huge spread of antennas the equipment is capable 
of sending pulses of electrical power into the atmosphere at 
power levels up to 7 million volts to test a phenomenon known as 
electromagnetic pulse or emp 
each pulse lasts only a billionth of a second and the navy 
maintains the testing will have no effect on human or marine life 
electromagnetic pulse is a powerful wave or surge of 
electrical energy that is released by a nuclear explosion and which 
can travel long distances through the atmosphere or water 
emp became a matter of concern to the military in the early 
1960s when the pentagon discovered a nuclear bomb detonated at high 
altitudes could generate a pulse so strong it could disable the 
electronic components used in computers communications and 
guidance equipment 
as a result of that discovery military laboratories have 
studied the phenomenon for 25 years in the course of developing 
methods for hardening electronic weapon components to withstand 
emp the navy wants to use the empress ii barge to test its success 
in hardening electronic equipment on its warships 
the foundation sued the defense department in march 1987 with 
the goal of stopping all emp testing until environmental impact 
studies had been performed 
earlier this year the pentagon agreed to settle that lawsuit by 
sharply curtailing or shutting down emp research facilities across 
the country until environmental assessments were performed in the 
case of empress ii however the navy argued it already had 
performed the necessary environmental study and thus could proceed 
with testing

a woman charged with kidnapping a 
businessman and helping bury him alive in a failed attempt to get 
1 million in ransom is the victim of mistaken identity an 
attorney said monday 
it was another woman not nancy rish who took part in the 
abduction of stephen small who was placed in a wooden box equipped 
with a makeshift air system before being buried defense attorney 
sherri carr told the jury 
but prosecutor michael ficaro said rish was willing to help her 
boyfriend kidnap small the greatgrandson of a former illinois 
governor because she wanted to share in the 1 million jackpot 
small 40 was abducted from his home in september 1987 he 
suffocated when the air pipe in the box failed 
rish 26 is charged with murder and kidnapping daniel edwards 
31 her roommate was convicted of the same charges in may and 
sentenced to die 
the burying of stephen small alive was what they were willing 
to do for 1 million that ticket to easy street life in the 
fastlane said ficaro the murder was a result of a cold 
callous calculating plan of nancy rish and danny edwards for the 
big score the 1 million jackpot 
but ms carr called the case a whodunnit and said the 
defense would identify the woman who really helped edwards carry 
out the kidnapping 
they would like you to believe this mystery is solved she 
said the mystery is why this young woman ms rish is sitting 
before you today 
fingerprints and hair samples taken in the case did not match

striking railroad workers 
paralyzed train service and stranded tens of thousands of commuters 
monday to try to win wage increases and regain buying power lost to 
inflation 
unions representing mailmen teachers doctors and other 
employees among the estimated 1 million argentines who work for the 
state have staged or are planning similar walkouts in what has 
become a major challenge to the governments antiinflation program 
president raul alfonsin said last week the government will try 
to keep wage increases for state employees at 4 percent a month in 
november and december except in the industries where productivity 
is increased private companies were urged to follow the same 
guideline 
inflation for october is projected at 8 percent unions are 
demanding wage increases of at least as much to keep pace with the 
inflation rate which was 25 percent in july 27 percent in august 
and 12 percent in september 
unions representing the railroad workers are demanding wage 
increases of 39 percent for october 
postal workers went on strike on monday and tuesday last week 
and have called another nationwide strike for wednesday mail 
deliveries also were interrupted friday and again this week 
flights of the national airlines aerolineas argentinas were 
disrupted friday by striking pilots ground crew and other 
personnel who are planning further work stoppages 
the 30000 employees of the state oil company yacimientos 
petroliferos fiscales threatened to strike last week but agreed to 
accept 4 percent raises in november and december after the 
government reduced the work day from eight hours to seven hours 
teachers in the buenos aires district won 15 percent pay raises 
for october but doctors at 150 public hospitals and court clerks 
across the nation are to go on strike wednesday 
the countrys biggest labor federation the general labor 
confederation is demanding that the minimum wage of about 87 be 
drastically increased 
carlos menem the opposition peronist partys candidate for 
president in the national elections set for may estimated last 
week that workers buying power has shrunk by 30 percent since 
alfonsin took office in december 1983 
since january 1984 inflation has soared by 49466 percent and 
the gross national product has remained stagnant for five years at 
about 76 billion alfonsins government has imposed wage and price 
controls currency devaluations and budget cutbacks in an 
unsuccessful effort to curtail increases in the cost of living 
the economy is the main issue in the political campaign and 
menem has promised pay raises and tax cuts if he is elected 
president 
eduardo angeloz the presidential candidate of alfonsins 
centrist radical civic union is depending on the governments 
antiinflation plan to take hold 
argentines will have to endure a clenched teeth struggle 
angeloz said in a campaign speech last week once the economy has 
been reorganized by selling off state companies and boosting 
exports argentina will finally recover its rightful place in the 
world 
in a poll published by the newspaper la nacion last week twice 
as many voters support menem as angeloz

investigators have narrowed to four the 
list of suspects in the strangling of a 16yearold church organist 
who was abducted from the sanctuary where she was cleaning up for 
services police said monday 
one an 18yearold high school student was interrogated for 
about three hours saturday night before police released him police 
chief grover smith said 
we havent eliminated him yet but there was not enough 
evidence to arrest him he said describing the case against the 
student as very circumstantial 
police have no idea why stephanie king a wellknown teenager 
in the southern alabama city was killed her body was found 
saturday afternoon in her car which was parked in a wooded area 
about four miles from alco baptist church 
but smith said he thinks the girl was slain in a crime of 
opportunity 
he the killer just went over there to the church saw her 
by herself and took advantage of the situation the chief said 
she wouldnt have had enough money to justify robbery and 
there was no indication of any sexual assault he added 
smith said authorities believe this person forced her to drive 
out where we found her and the assault took place in the car 
apparently 
about 1045 am saturday miss king had telephoned the rev 
bobby rone from the church to tell him that someone there wanted to 
talk to him smith said 
rone spoke to the unidentified person over the telephone and

she was cleaning up the church she had a parttime job 
there smith said he declined to comment about the position of

president reagan signed legislation monday 
authorizing the pentagon to close unneeded military bases as the 
white house began poring over mounds of bills passed by congress in 
its waning days 
reagan who often has complained about what he sees as 
porkbarrel spending on capitol hill kept his approval of the 
baseclosing legislation lowkey the presidents approval of the 
bill passed overwhelmingly by both the house and senate was 
merely noted in a white house press office statement listing an 
assortment of bills he signed 
among the other pieces of legislation that reagan signed were 
one requiring the secretary of agriculture to set up a 10year 
program to study the effects of air pollutants on forest ecology 
he approved a bill extending temporary authority to pay overtime to 
federal employees fighting forest fires and another one 
establishing a new technology administration within the commerce 
department 
reagan is scheduled to sign legislation tuesday morning creating 
a new cabinetlevel department of veterans affairs the president 
will sign the legislation at the conclusion of a speech to the 
national defense university at fort mcnair in the district of 
columbia the white house said 
the bill giving the defense department authorization to close 
bases has been estimated to have the potential of saving the 
government up to 5 billion a year as pentagon officials pare down 
the list of 3800 us military installations 
the senate approved the bill 827 and the house followed shortly 
afterward with a 37031 vote 
the bill sets up a complicated baseclosing procedure which 
essentially cuts through the thicket of laws enacted by congress in 
the past decade to thwart pentagon efforts to shut down bases 
it also endorses a pentagonappointed commission which has been 
meeting for months trying to put together a list of bases to be 
closed the current panel will be expanded to 12 members by the 
bill 
the panel will make its recommendations by dec 31 defense 
secretary frank c carlucci would have until jan 15 five days 
before he leaves office to either accept or reject the entire 
list he could not change the list 
if carlucci approves the list congress would have until 
midapril to overturn the proposal but it could only do that by 
approving a resolution which could then be vetoed by the incoming 
president 
no base closures would begin before 1990 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters that some 
120 pieces of legislation had been received at the white house and 
that he expected action on many of them within the next few days 
congress adjourned early saturday 
out of 120 bills some of them are going to be vetoed yes 
fitzwater said but i dont know which ones 
the spokesman said for example that while the white house has 
signaled its general support for a bill making technical 
corrections in the 1986 law overhauling the us tax code we 
have major problems with some aspects of the legislation 
reagan is expected to sign legislation immediately authorizing 
500 million in new spending on the effort to combat drug 
trafficking 
the presidents approval was virtually assured when the senate 
kept intact a house provision allowing for the death penalty for 
certain crimes committed in the commission of drug trafficking 
during his daily news briefing fitzwater called the 100th 
congress very productive and said we are extraordinarily 
pleased that so many parts of the presidents agenda have been 
enacted into law in this congress 
you all know the criticism that a lame duck president cant do 
anything he told reporters 
he cited the timely passage of 13 appropriations bills financing 
government operations in the new budget year along with passage of 
welfare reform catastrophic illness and drug abuse legislation

president reagan turned seven shovelsful of 
dirt monday as he helped transplant a willow oak from maryland on 
the south lawn of the white house as part of a program started by 
franklin d roosevelt in 1936 
after the fourth shovelful reagan said i may stay here 
after the seventh a reporter asked him how long he thought it 
would take to turn over the entire pile of dirt that had been 
heaped up beside the 18foot tall tree 
it would seem as long as a press conference he said 
presidential press conferences usually last half an hour 
i think ill leave it to someone else the president said 
the tree which is 14 years old was grown at angelica nursery 
in kennedyville on marylands eastern shore 
it is a gift from the american association of nurserymen which 
formed a committee in 1979 to evaluate and maintain the white house 
gardens and grounds 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the tree was planted 
as part of a landscape plan commissioned by fdr three years after 
he took office 
the nurserymens group also donated a sugar maple tree that 
reagan planted in 1984 just north of the west wing 
it is alive and flourishing fitzwater said

a national labor relations board judge on 
monday overruled harvard universitys objection to a union election 
in may accusing the university of misrepresenting both the unions 
conduct and labor law 
in a harshly worded opinion nlrb administrative law judge joel 
a harmatz certified the harvard union of clerical and technical 
workers as the winner in the election to unionize harvards 3400 
technical and clerical workers 
the union an affiliate of the 1 millionmember american 
federation of state county and municipal employees won the 
election on a 15301486 vote characterized by a 90 percent 
turnout among those eligible 
harmatz dismissed as unfounded harvards complaints that the 
union illegally coerced yes votes through a coordinated 
campaign to assure that union supporters cast ballots 
harvards brief in the case harmatz said is replete with 
misinterpretations of the record of eight days of hearings the 
nlrb held in august on the universitys charges 
because these references either are not supported by or 
grossly overstate the proven facts this decision seeks to at this 
level bring a halt to this approach the judge said 
he further chastised harvard saying additional delay has 
been occasioned by the employers proclivity to disguise as fact 
argumentative and sometimes frivolous interpretations of the 
evidence in the case 
the union drive which began in 1975 and the universitys 
challenge had been viewed by several labor leaders as a major test 
of their ability to organize new cadres of educated white and 
graycollar technical workers assuming a greater proportion of the 
workforce 
harvard spokeswoman marjorie heffron said no decision has been 
made on whether to appeal harmatzs ruling to the full fivemember 
board under the law it has two weeks to file an appeal 
the universitys position is sound and the union acted 
improperly harvard vice president for finance robert scott said 
in a prepared statement it is plain that the opinion by 
harmatz does not accurately reflect the record of the hearings in 
many respects 
afscme president gerald mcentee said monday that the election 
and the nlrb action upholding the results was crucial for afscme 
and as a test case for the labor movement as a whole 
the issues raised in this campaign were the issues that affect 
the workforce of today and tomorrow job and family issues that 
include affordable quality child care decent pensions and 
benefits and flexibility in hours of work he said 
among other things harvard had accused the union of coercing 
yes votes by offering transportation to voting places and 
maintaining lists of union supporters to assure that they cast 
ballots 
the university also claimed that a practice in which union 
sympathizers often accompanied some of the voting workers to the 
polls and the placing of prounion balloons banners and posters 
around the campus but not in the polling places themselves also 
amounted to coercion 
stripped of glossy unconfirmed characterization the 
employers complaint here addresses a perfectly legitimate 
apparently successful tactical maneuver by the union which was 
calculated to convert preelection support into yes votes to the 
greatest extent possible harmatz said

iran recently has executed hundreds of 
dissidents because it fears a popular backlash at home 
following the aug 20 truce in its war with iraq the main iranian 
opposition movement claimed monday 
the mujahedeen khalq or peoples holy warriors said 250 
political prisoners were executed in rasht a caspian sea town 140 
miles northwest of tehran the group made the claim in a statement 
sent by telex from its headquarters in baghdad iraq to the 
associated press in nicosia 
scores more were executed in prisons in tehran the central city 
of isfahan and the northwestern city of tabriz the statement said 
hundreds of other prisoners have been executed en masse by 
firing squads in prisons in the northeastern city of mashhad the 
western city of arak and a half dozen other towns in recent weeks 
it said 
no independent confirmation was available of the mujahedeen 
report the movement claimed last month that an estimated 1200 
political prisoners had been killed in iran since midsummer 
irans official news media monitored in cyprus have reported 
that scores of counterrevolutionaries and iraqi spies were 
executed by firing squad or publicly hanged in several cities over 
the last two months 
but the londonbased human rights group amnesty international 
said indications surfaced that hundreds of iranian political 
prisoners have been executed since july 
mujahedeen leader masoud rajavi appealed to un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar aug 26 to help pressure 
iran to halt what rajavi called the accelerated pace of killings 
in iran amid mass roundups of suspected dissidents 
western correspondents reported after recent visits to tehran 
that many executed prisoners were buried in mass graves 
amnesty said authorities banned families from visiting political 
prisoners 
the us house of representatives last week approved a 
resolution declaring june 20 a national day of remembrance for 
political prisoners held in iran 
the reported wave of executions accelerated after the 
mujahedeens military force the national liberation army of iran 
pushed into western iran before the aug 20 ceasefire took effect 
and reportedly captured two major towns before withdrawing after 
fierce fighting 
the mujahedeen said hundreds of iranians who welcomed their 
fighters were later publicly hanged some iranian leaders 
including chief justice musavi ardebili publicly demanded 
executing liberation army prisoners without trial 
the liberation army has had to halt its military operations into 
western iran under the truce 
but mujahedeen officials have said that with political rifts 
deepened within the tehran hierarchy by the ceasefire the 
government fears the dissidents will pose a growing threat 
diplomatic sources speaking on condition of anyonmity have 
reported that despite political uncertainties triggered by irans 
sudden collapse in the war after a string of major military 
defeats no major threat to the tehran government is apparent 
but internal divisions within the leadership showed clear signs 
of widening in recent months over the economy and over efforts by 
some pragmatic leaders led by house speaker hashemi rafsanjani to 
end irans political isolation 
the mujahedeen were allied with ayatollah ruhollah khomeini in 
his islamic revolution that toppled shah mohammad reza pahlavi in 
1979 but rajavi and his supporters fled to france after the 
fundamentalists turned on their erstwhile liberal and leftist 
allies in bloody purges in 1980 
rajavi moved to iran two years ago after iran pressured france 
to expel antikhomeini dissidents

soviet icebreakers trying to help rescue two 
whales off barrow alaska also were involved in a whale rescue off 
eastern siberia three years ago an american official involved in 
joint ussoviet ocean research said monday 
in 1985 soviet icebreakers broke through an ice barrier in the 
gulf of anadyr trying to free several dozen beluga whales said 
robert v miller deputy director of the national marine laboratory 
in seattle 
reports are mixed but i think they did get some out miller 
said in a telephone interview 
unlike the barrow whales trapped under the ice the anadyr 
whales were in a small area of water that was cut off from the 
ocean by a ring of ice icebreakers had to break through the ring 
belugas are smaller than the california gray whales off barrow 
typically 15 feet long compared with 50 feet 
miller said he did not know whether the soviet vessels involved 
in the barrow attempt were also involved at anadyr 
the gulf of anadyr is in the western bering sea south of the 
chukchi peninsula the easternmost portion of siberia 
the united states and the soviet union have been cooperating on 
whale and other marine mammal research in the northern pacific 
bering sea and arctic oceans since 1973 under the ussoviet 
treaty on environmental protection 
they have conducted at least 15 joint research cruises and 
scientists from the two countries visit each others laboratories 
about twice a year miller said 
though the icebreakers at barrow were not part of the research 
agreement the willingness of the soviet union to lend a hand shows 
that its scientists are very much interested in marine mammals 
and conservation of these animals miller said

an investigator said monday that an american 
group may have been the intended recipient of photographs of us 
hostages found in the suitcase of a lebanese airline passenger 
photograhps of american hostages terry anderson and alann steen 
along with a letter bearing steens name and a third photo were 
found last thursday in the luggage of a woman passenger from beirut 
at milans linate airport 
police said the lebanese woman who was arrested was to deliver 
the photos and documents to aldo anghessa an italian arms trader 
with known links to the italian and swiss secret services 
we know the group that shipped them documents and pictures 
and we identified the man who delivered the material to the 
lebanese woman said achille serra head of milans 
antiterrorist police 
anghessa acted as a gobetween between the two groups he 
added one party was a lebanese organization we have identified 
the final destination we cannot tell you about the latter 
pressed about the final destination serra said you know an 
american organization is interested in getting this material you 
have the experience to understand which one 
later monday serra said he had not suggested the us government 
was to receive the pictures and documents and insisted he had been 
speculating earlier and was not giving an official conclusion 
police identified the woman as aline ibrahim rizkallah 36 in 
beirut the islamic jihad group that holds anderson said she was 
not a member of its organization 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman said 
anghessa had no connection to the us government and american 
officials did not know what he intended to do with the documents 
redman said the united states believes those who act without 
us government authorization to try to free the hostages in 
lebanon should butt out 
he also said the affair might be a fraud and that the 
photographs did not appear to be originals 
president reagan was asked at a white house tree planting 
ceremony whether anyone from the united states government was 
dealing with the iranians about the hostages and said not to my 
knowledge adding they wouldnt be doing it without my 
knowledge 
the picture of anderson the chief middle east correspondent for 
the associated press appeared similar in reverse image to a 
black and white photograph of anderson released in beirut on aug 
18 
the man in the third photograph initially had been identified as 
american hostage thomas sutherland but police later said it was 
not him 
ms rizkallah was jailed in milan after police also found she 
was carrying 1000 in counterfeit us bills and 17 ounces of 
heroin 
anghessa has been interrogated but not arrested and there is no 
evidence he had commited a crime police said 
the romebased newspaper il messaggero quoted anghessa as saying 
he knew nothing about ms rizkallah or her parcels and he was 
willing to cooperate with investigators 
islamic jihad in an arabiclanguage statement distributed in 
lebanon said ms rizkallah was not involved in any matter 
related to us whatsoever and claimed she had links with israels 
secret service it called the photograph of anderson sheer 
fabrication 
anderson 40 was kidnapped in beirut march 16 1985 and is the 
longest held of the 14 foreigners including nine american missing 
and presumed kidnapped in lebanon

oliver l norths claim that he wasnt warned 
that lying to congress would result in criminal prosecution shows a 
shocking and cynical view of american government irancontra 
prosecutors said monday 
the former presidential aides argument that he cannot be 
prosecuted for making false statements about aiding nicaraguan 
rebels is incompatible with the aspirations of our system of 
government and we believe inconsistent with any but the most 
jaundiced view of the realities of politics and government 
prosecutors said in a reply to defense motions 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh meanwhile consented to 
the dismissal of one of the 16 counts against north a former 
national security council official and retired marine lieutenant 
colonel 
walsh said he did not oppose a defense motion to dismiss a 
charge that north obstructed an fbi investigation into the 
construction of a 13800 security fence outside his suburban 
virginia home 
north is accused of preparing false documents in december 1986 
to hide the fact that arms dealer richard v secord paid for the 
fence north who claims he was the target of terrorist threats is 
also accused of illegally accepting the fence as a gratuity 
walsh did not dispute a defense contention that the alleged 
fabrication wasnt an obstruction of justice because the grand jury 
investigation did not begin until a month later 
but the prosecution offered a spirited defense of charges that 
north made false statements to congressional committees to obstruct 
inquiries into reports that he was covertly helping raise money to 
arm the contras 
in order to prevent congressional discovery of the 
conspirators covert activities north engaged in a continuing 
campaign of lies and deception prosecutors said 
ridiculing norths defense prosecutors said he was in effect 
arguing that the false statements did not impede congress because 
no one could be so naive as to believe that a high government 
official might be telling the truth 
norths rebuttal reflects a shocking and cynical view of the 
relations between the peoples elected representatives in congress 
and officials of the executive branch prosecutors said 
the false statements were made in 1985 after the house permanent 
select committee on intelligence and a house foreign affairs 
subcommittee inquired about news reports that north and others were 
covertly helping arm the contra rebels in violation of the 
socalled boland amendment that provision prohibited direct 
military assistance to the rebels 
north responded with calculated falsehood intending to derail 
further investigation and generally succeeding prosecutors said 
of charges that the former nsc aide drafted letters that falsely 
denied his involvement in covert aid and fundraising 
the prosecution urged rejection of norths contention that he 
did not receive fair warning that an executive branch official or 
a member of his staff would be guilty of a crime if the truth were 
misstated in an unsworn communication to congress 
norths lawyers cited a litany of examples of lying by top 
officials including untruthful statements about the u2 spy plane 
and secretary of state john foster dulles false denial to congress 
of cia support for a 1958 rebellion against indonesian president 
sukarno 
when a committee of congress makes a formal request for 
information from executive officers deliberately false responses 
intended to thwart the inquiry are not a privileged part of our 
system but criminal obstruction walsh said 
north also charged with lying at a 1986 briefing for the 
intelligence panel drafted false letters that were signed by 
thennational security adviser robert c mcfarlane to erect a 
barrier of lies and misrepresentations that effectively aborted the 
congressional inquiries 
mcfarlane pleaded guilty last spring to four misdemeanor counts 
of withholding information about norths activities from congress 
in the letters and in 1986 testimony 
walsh also disclosed some new details about norths destruction 
of sensitive nsc documents when the irancontra affair was 
unraveling in 1986 
the destroyed material included original copies of socalled 
system iv documents the most sensitive records in the nscs 
carefully constructed system of document control prosecutors 
said 
north also purposely withheld from nsc files original copies of 
documents including memos and messages the papers he kept in his 
office included documents that were the sole record of the events 
and activities described therein prosecutors said

a coalition of religious groups on monday 
urged the leaders of operation rescue the group responsible for 
demonstrations blocking entrances to abortion clinics since july 
to repent 
operation rescue is an act of terrorism katherine hancock 
ragsdale of the episcopal womens caucus told a news conference 
the illegal and immoral activities of operation rescue are a blot 
on our nations conscience 
in the name of god i call upon them to repent she said 
ragsdales views were shared by other representatives from some 
of the 30 jewish and protestant religions that comprise the 
religious coalition for abortion rights 
our organizations have gathered here today to announce that we 
must and we will continue to defend our precious liberties 
said rabbi jack luxemburg of the american jewish congress 
no group no matter how many or how militant will persuade us 
to retreat to a time when women died from abortions obtained in 
back alleys he said 
the coalition does not take issue with the new yorkbased 
operation rescues antiabortion stance but with the groups 
methodology which they said was a violation of a womans 
constitutional right to choose abortion said coalition president 
faith evans 
they act as if there is a national debate about the right to a 
woman to have an abortion but there is not thats been settled by 
roe versus wade evans said of the landmark supreme court ruling 
he noted that the coalitions operation respect would continue 
to offer escort and counseling services for harassed clinic workers 
and clients 
operation rescue which has called for nationwide demonstrations 
on oct 29 attempts to prevent or dissuade women from having 
abortions by blocking clinic entrances or by conducting sidewalk 
counseling 
more than 1200 antiabortion demonstrators have been arrested 
and refused to accept bail since the protests began july 19 during 
the democratic national convention in atlanta all of the 
protestors including 300 arrested in a demonstration earlier this 
month have been released 
theirs is not the message of love compassion and concern that 
a jesus of nazareth would condone theirs is a message of lies of 
hate of cruelty and punishment reflective of the witch burners and 
torturers disguised in the name of religion said natalie 
gulbrandson of the unitarian universalist association 
coalition members criticized operation rescues attempts to 
align their actions with the civil disobedience of the civil 
rights movement and decried operation rescues attempts to compare 
abortion to the holocaust of world war ii 
by comparing abortion to the holocaust the civil rights 
movement and antislavery movement they impugn the humanity of 
millions of jewish and black people said the rev theodore h 
erickson of the united church board for homeless ministries of the 
united church of christ

central america remains the exception to 
worldwide peace trends and foreign aid to rebels subverts the 
regional peace process secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
said monday 
at this juncture when other conflicts seem to be on the way 
to solution i appeal to the central american countries and other 
countries to renew their collective commitment to peace perez de 
cuellar said in his annual report on the region 
central american governments must redouble efforts to overcome 
obstacles and the countries outside the region with ties and 
interests in it must resolutely decide to facilitate that task and 
refrain from any action likely to undermine it he said without 
naming countries 
the united states supports rebels battling nicaraguas 
sandinista government cuba and the soviet union back leftwing 
guerrillas in el salvador and other countries 
perez de cuellar was commenting on the peace agreement signed 
aug 7 1987 by the presidents of costa rica guatemala 
nicaragua honduras and el salvador it calls for progress toward 
democracy and national reconciliation noninterference in the 
internal affairs of other countries and an end to foreign military 
aid 
there has been an apparent lack of similar progress towards 
fulfillment of the commitments on nonuse of territory to attack 
other states and on termination of aid for irregular forces and 
insurrectionist movements perez de cuellar said 
the lack of progress has undermined the strategy aimed at 
bringing about the cessation of hostilities on the basis of a broad 
amnesty and democratization in conjunction with the termination of 
aid for rebels he added 
significant progress in democratic reforms was made 
immediately after the agreement was signed perez de cuellar said 
he cited establishment of national reconciliation commissions 
amnesty decrees the lifting of states of emergency expanding 
political pluralism and movements toward ending hostilities 
now however the principle of simultaneous democratization and 
ending aid to rebels appears to have been replaced by the 
principle of unilateralism he said and reciprocity must be 
restored 
central americas development has been hurt by the political 
turmoil and the crisis is perpetuating unjust social and economic 
structures perez de cuellar declared

the democratic and republican party chairmen 
briefly put aside their differences on monday to endorse a 
bipartisan television advertising campaign urging americans to vote 
they also combined their voices in criticizing news 
mediasponsored election polls which they say discourage voters 
from going to the polls 
the ad campaign underwritten by bell atlantic relies on 
bipartisan commercials urging americans to be more than just 
talk and vote on nov 8 
it seems to me we have lost sight that with the rights granted 
under our form of government are certain very very important and 
fundamental responsibilities said gop chairman frank j 
fahrenkopf jr lamenting the traditionally low voter turnout in 
us elections 
in this the most advanced democracy in the world we have 
close to the lowest voter turnout said democratic chairman paul 
g kirk jr about 54 percent of americans over 18 voted in the 1984 
presidential election 
kirk answering questions at a news conference where the ads 
were unveiled said the negative tone of this presidential campaign 
has turned people off which may affect voting levels this year 
but he and fahrenkopf said the media also could do more to 
motivate and educate voters with their coverage of the campaign 
they said they were concerned that polls commissioned by the 
media to determine who was ahead in the campaign discouraged voters 
from casting a ballot 
when polls show one candidate comfortably ahead before the 
election is over people have a feeling what good is my 
vote fahrenkopf said kirk said polls undertaken by the news 
media have a skewing effect and a psychological effect 
the getoutthevote ads feature appearances by presidents 
carter and ford felix cavaliere of the rascals singing group 
rerecorded his 1968 song people got to be free as the theme 
the ads were produced in conjunction with vote america a 
nonpartisan nonprofit group that works to increase voter 
participation

anniversary of its charter monday with a un day peace walk in the 
rose garden of the new york headquarters and praise of the world 
organizations peacekeeping efforts 
the celebration followed a weekend rebuff by the us senate 
that rejected a reagan administration request for 150 million to 
help support current or anticipated un peacekeeping efforts in 
afghanistan the persian gulf and southern africa 
some senators said they were not satisfied despite 
administration assurances that us aid to antimarxist rebels in 
angola would continue 
washington has been withholding regular dues to compel the 
united nations to make budgetary and political reforms that has 
made the united states which is assessed 25 percent of the budget 
the largest debtor to the united nations but still its largest 
contributor 
on oct 14 the united states paid 856 million in back dues 
reducing its regularbudget arrears to 3663 million it is 
withholding another 59 million until the main un financial 
committee adopts austerity measures 
un officials had little to say monday about the senate action 
there is no reaction said francois giuliani spokesman for 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar obviously member 
states have a legal obligation to participate in peackeeping 
operations as assessed by the general assembly but this is an 
internal us problem 
officials and diplomats strolled silently through the un rose 
garden on the banks of the east river in a meditative walk for 
peace 
in a statement marking un day perez de cuellar said the 
united nations is playing a larger peacemaking role 
after years of drift and decline in multilateral cooperation 
the organization has begun to resume its rightful role in 
international life he said 
dante caputo foreign minister of argentina and current 
president of the general assembly told a gathering sunday at the 
cathedral of st john the divine in new york that the world 
situation is improving and the united nations has been instrumental 
in resolving conflicts 
the threats of nuclear catastrohe great power tensions and 
many regional conflicts and problems have been significantly 
lessened this year he declared 
this years nobel peace prize went to un peacekeeping 
operations around the world 
perez de cuellar praised the peacekeepers in his statement and 
said the united nations no longer is bypassed or ignored 
he said the united nations should avoid selfcongratulation 
because nations with the will to make peace deserve the credit and 
we are but the servants of this will 
the united nations is the instrument for translating the 
impulse for peace into concrete agreements he added and helps 
show the way to peace with honor and compromise without

president mikhail s gorbachev said at a state 
dinner monday for west germanys helmut kohl that the soviet union 
is not an economic backyard and reforms are succeeding despite 
international doubts 
lack of progress in relations with the soviet union feeds on 
the outdated stereotypes that the russians will not be able to 
manage by themselves he said i want to say to all who are 
going to have business with us we will manage 
gorbachev who also heads the soviet communist party seemed to 
be replying to questions raised in the west about his ability to 
stay in power and install his reform program through the upheaval 
it is already beginning to cause 
there has been considerable controversy over the 9 billion in 
credits moscow has arranged in recent months from western banks 
including some in west germany some politicians oppose such 
lending saying the soviet union should be forced to cut defense 
spending in order to increase the production of needed food and 
consumer products 
gorbachev told soviet television earlier that he and chancellor 
kohl had started their first meeting of the fourday official visit 
with cordial discussions of difficult issues and he said we have 
a real chance to achieve a substantial improvement in relations 
the ice has started to move and we hope it will start to 
float away gorbachev said 
mondays meeting was the first formal meeting between the two 
men since gorbachev became the soviet leader in 1985 
warmer relations with west germany would be a significant 
change the soviet union has for decades acted as if the nazi 
invasion occurred yesterday rather than almost 50 years ago 
however gorbachev refused to budge from moscows longtime 
refusal to consider any move toward the unification of east and 
west germany 
kohl in his address called for a healing of old wounds 
it must become possible for the germans to overcome the 
division of their country by peaceful means the chancellor said 
following the defeat of nazi germany in world war ii the nation 
split into communist east germany a member of the soviet bloc and 
west germany a strong ally of the united states and member of the 
north atlantic treaty organization 
in a surprise comment during the dinner speech gorbachev 
suggested that europe needs a unified electrical and transportation 
network 
kohl also spoke of transboundary challenges and named 
terrorism drugs and epidemics as issues requiring greater 
cooperation but he said the greatest obstacle to warm relations is 
soviet superiority in conventional armed forces in europe 
in a related meeting soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze suggested to west german foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher that a summit meeting of the leaders of 
europe the united states and canada might help produce progress in 
vienna negotiations on reductions in conventional weapons and 
forces 
among business deals signed between soviet and west german 
enterprises monday was an agreement by the german siemens firm to 
aid soviet organizations in the design and creation of nuclear 
power stations computers and medical equipment 
sovietwest german relations have been improving in the past 
year especially since the ussoviet summit meeting in december 
in washington when gorbachev and president reagan signed a treaty 
to ban medium and shorterrange nuclear missiles in europe 
kohl was greeted at the vnukovo airport by shevardnadze premier 
nikolai i ryzhkov defense minister dmitri t yazov and other top 
officials 
he and his wife hannelore then went to the kremlin for a formal 
greeting in st georges hall by gorbachev and his wife raisa

iran told the international red cross on 
monday it is ready to exchange prisoners of war with iraq under the 
un peace plan if iraq agrees to the same terms 
the foreign ministry statement to the international committee of 
the red cross in geneva repeated irans assertion that it is 
prepared for the speedy repatriation of prisoners of war but it 
said the exchange must occur under security council resolution 598 
that resolution passed unanimously july 20 1987 and accepted 
by iran a year later also embodies a peace plan for the 8yearold 
war and the secretarygenerals implementation program copies of 
the iranian statement were circulated monday at un headquarters 
in new york 
iraq has expressed willingness to begin immediate repatriation 
of pows on humanitarian grounds if iran agrees but outside the 
un peace process 
iranian diplomats have said the iraqi move is an effort to 
undermine resolution 598 which calls for a comprehensive peace 
swift exchange of pows after a truce and withdrawal to 
international borders 
iraq has claimed iran is stalling on the pow issue peace talks 
in geneva are deadlocked but plans for the next round are expected 
to be announced tuesday 
according to red cross records iran has 50182 iraqi pows and 
iraq 19284 iranians but un officials and diplomats in both 
countries estimate the totals at 6000070000 held in iran and 
3000050000 in iraq

vice president george bushs campaign 
launched a new advertising drive aimed at hispanic voters monday 
with bilingual ads featuring his daughterinlaw columba and

children and bush 
for hispanics like me this presidential election will be the 
most important in our history mrs bush begins 
the vice president winds up the commercial saying as 
president ill have a lot of reasons to help hispanics everywhere 
because ill not only be answering to my grandchildren ill be 
answering to history 
bush campaign officials said the new advertisement which is 
being aired in both spanish and english is designed to take 
advantage of what they called spanishspeaking michael dukakis 
failure to appeal to the substantial hispanic vote in texas 
we think from our internal surveys that there is a 
tremendous opportunity in the rio grande valley and within the 
hispanic community overall in the state said reggie bashur 
deputy campaign manager 
dukakis has not gotten his message through in texas and 
clearly he has not gotten a message through to hispanics bashur 
said 
mark sanders a bush campaign spokesman said the commercial 
began airing monday on stations in dallas houston san antonio 
the rio grande valley and el paso they will run until the nov 8

a television news program said two soviet 
icebreakers were on their way monday to help rescue a pair of 
whales who became trapped in arctic ice off alaska because they 
were young inexperienced and curious 
soviet media have been restrained in reporting the dramatic 
effort to free the two california grey whales who were stranded in 
the ice while trying to migrate south 
the news program vremya told the story best with film of the 
crystalline arctic scene where eskimos were chainsawing breathing 
holes in the ice for the mammals trying to migrate south 
it also showed one of the whales popping up for air in a channel 
cut in the ice and provided a closeup of an icecutting tractor 
and of weights being dropped from a helicopter to crack the ice 
but the morning newspaper pravda made no mention of the whales 
situation which has drawn worldwide attention the afternoon paper 
izvestia carried only a short item reporting that the soviet 
icebreaking ships admiral makarov and vladimir arseniev could 
arrive off the alaskan coast as early as monday evening to offer 
assistance 
other soviet newspapers do not publish on monday 
soviet help was requested because the united states did not have 
an icebreaker near the site off point barrow 
the official news agency tass noted in its report that whales 
are an endangered species or in soviet parlance in the red 
book that lists plants and animals with dangerously low 
populations 
neither tass nor izvestia mentioned that the soviet union hunted 
whales until may 1987 
at the time the soviet union was the worlds secondlargest 
whaling nation it halted its harvest only after the united states 
imposed sanctions by cutting in half the amount of fish the soviets 
were allowed to take from us waters 
the soviet union then said it might resume whalehunting in 1990 
if the population of the animals had risen sufficiently 
many soviets have embraced environmentalism with ferocity in the 
past year as the policy of glasnost or openness has allowed 
citizens to protest the effects of years of industrial development 
that ignored the ecology 
it is unclear whether the soviet ships will arrive in time or do 
much good because the ocean may be too shallow at the site of the 
ice blockage 
time is pressing izvestia said the situation of the 
whales is worsening in the eyes of the rescuers 
vremya was more optimistic predicting the whales would soon be 
heading toward open water due to the efforts of people from both 
countries 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman said 
monday he believes the positive soviet response to the us request 
is due more to the current spirit of goodwill and cooperation 
between the two nations than to the terms of a 1976 environmental 
agreement betweem washington and moscow

hussein and arafat and said if israel failed to respond then it 
will find itself very isolated in the world community 
waldegrave minister of state for foreign and commonwealth 
affairs told a news conference at the british embassy i think 
we can have some influence on the united states in bringing it to 
see that israel must respond 
but in an interview broadcast in london on monday prime 
minister yitzhak shamir of israel said the plo will never change 
and so israel which views the plo as a terrorist organization 
will never negotiate with it 
in cairo egypt visiting norwegian defense minister johan 
joergen holst said monday that the recent meetings of arab leaders 
showed something is happening which will bring closer an 
international peace conference 
holst said of the jordanianegyptianpalestinian summit on 
saturday i think this meeting serves eloquent notice that 
something is happening with a new initiative and a new momentum 
i think this will bring the world closer to the international 
peace conference to settle the problem he added 
both the united states and israel oppose convening an 
international conference on the arabisrael conflict with plo 
participation 
turkeys ozal said in a dinner speech that he believed the 
palestine national council will adopt a policy that will lead to 
a legitimate and lasting peace process in the middle east 
ozal said the palestinian problem could come to an end with the 
recognition of the legitimate rights of palestinian people 
including selfdetermination and establishment of an independent 
state he said israeli troops should withdraw from the occupied 
arab lands 
turkey recognizes the plo as the sole legitimate representative 
of the palestinian people 
in amman jordan a senior plo official said monday that king 
husseins meeting with arafat signaled a new era in the history 
of relations between jordan and the plo

meeting had a positive impact on all aspects of 
jordanianpalestinian relations 
he said the simultaneous amman meetings of the joint committee 
that disperses funds in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza 
strip were held in a brotherly atmosphere 
the plo official told the associated press that the committee 
meetings focused on the situation in the occupied territories torn 
by a palestinian uprising since last december and ways of 
increasing financial aid from arab countries 
in his broadcast remarks shamir dismissed as a tactical step 
of doubletalk any notion of the plos reconciling itself to 
israels existence 
shamir said on british broadcasting corp radio we know the 
plo they will never change their character their philosophy and 
therefore we will never negotiate with them 
asked if he had any sympathy for the palestinian demand for a 
homeland shamir said my objective is to solve our problems and 
not the problems of the arabs and palestinians

positive relationship that existed between thailand and the united 
states has erected a solution ms voedisch said 
upon receipt of this gift the art institute will relinquish 
all rights and title to the lintel and donate it to thailand the 
museum said in a statement 
ms voedisch said a decision was expected soon on a replacement 
for the lintel and that the lintel would be returned at that time 
the museum and the foundation are considering several works but 
no decision on a replacement for the lintel has been made she said 
she said thai officials had been alerted of the museums 
decision but she did not think a response had been received by the 
art institute 
the lintel a 2by3 foot stone crosspiece designed to fit above 
a door or window depicts in relief the hindu god vishnu reclining 
on water it dates to cambodias khmer dynasty covering the years 
8051250 
it disappeared from the phnom rung temple a national monument 
in northeastern thailand during the 1960s thai officials say 
in february 1988 21 years after the lintel was first displayed 
at the art institute the museum learned that the thai government 
wanted it returned for the temples restoration the museum said 
negotiations between thai officials and the art institute began 
at that time 
thai demonstrators protested outside the museum earlier this 
year trying to have it returned in time for reopening ceremonies 
at the thai temple in may 
the art institute received the lintel from the chicagobased 
alsdorf foundation which acquired it in 1967 through a new york 
art dealer the museum said 
the new york dealer in turn purchased the carving in 1966 from a 
dealer in bangkok where it was being offered for sale on the open 
market the art institute said

the captain of an italian freighter that 
collided with a greek cruise ship and left two people dead and two 
others missing appeared in court monday on manslaughter charges and 
said he was not to blame for the accident 
capt flavio caminale of genoa italy was arrested friday 
after his freighter adige hit and sank a greek cruise ship carrying 
486 british students and their teachers 
two greek seamen were killed and more than 60 people were 
injured before the 6300ton cruise ship jupiter went down less 
than one mile off piraeus harbor near athens two british 
passengers vivienne barley 14 and bernard butt 41 were 
missing and presumed dead the merchant marine ministry said 
caminale 45 is charged with manslaughter through negligence 
causing serious injuries causing a shipwreck and ignoring shipping 
regulations 
im innocent caminale said during the 30minute hearing 
i was not technically responsible for this tragedy and am very 
sorry about the death of these people a weeping caminale said 
outside court 
district attorney antonis roussos and investigating magistrate 
telemachus flezouras ordered the captain detained pending a court 
appearance wednesday in which he will be questioned and the charges 
formally recorded 
under greek judicial procedure a defendant must be presented 
with the charges in a court the next working day after his arrest 
in a subsequent hearing he is questioned at length and the 
magistrate revises the charges if necessary before formalizing them 
the magistrate will decide wednesday whether caminale will be 
jailed pending trial if convicted of the charges caminale could 
spend one to five years in prison 
the 5500ton adige was sailing into piraeus with a cargo of 
automobiles when it punched a hole in the side of the jupiter 
which was taking the british children and their teachers on an 
eightday mediterranean cruise the children jumped overboard and 
were picked up by tugboats and fishing vessels before the jupiter 
sank 40 minutes later 
two jupiter crewmen died when they were crushed against the 
ships side as they tried to attach cables from a tugboat 
more than 60 passengers were hospitalized most suffering from 
shock and minor injuries all but one have returned to britain 
none of the adiges 22member crew was injured and the vessel 
suffered only minor damage 
greek and italian accounts of the collision differ sharply 
the jupiters chief mate kyriakos moustakis said the adige was 
heading toward the cruise ship on a collision course and failed to 
change direction 
under international maritime rules ships leaving harbor have 
right of way 
caminale said the adige was waiting for a greek pilot to assist 
it in docking and was not moving when the jupiter changed course 
and plowed into its prow 
in the italian port city of genoa aldo grimaldi owner of the 
italian freighter said monday that greek officials were trying to 
hide the truth about the accident to protect their own tourism 
the greek press is accomplishing this moral lynching of 
commander caminale we have asked for the intervention of the 
ministry of the merchant marine and the foreign ministry as well as 
the italian ambassador in athens to protect the good name of the 
italian merchant navy and of our crew that did all it could to save 
human lives he added 
grimaldi echoed caminales comments that the italian ship had 
stopped when the jupiter changed course and struck the italian ship 
in the bow as it turned

the late teamsters president jackie presser 
could hire as he saw fit at his local and did so in conjunction 
with his secret role as an fbi informant a defense lawyer said in 
opening statements at a racketeering trial monday 
harold friedman 66 and anthony hughes 52 are the remaining 
defendants in an alleged ghost employee scheme federal 
prosecutors contended was masterminded by presser international 
president of the teamsters from 1983 until july 9 when he died of 
brain cancer 
the first prosecution witness in a trial that could run eight 
weeks was richard a crino an area administrator with the us 
department of labor 
he explained the federal financial disclosure statement union 
locals are required to submit the documents contain names of paid 
employees at teamsters local 507 in cleveland some of whom 
allegedly were paid but did no work 
friedman a teamsters international vice president and president 
of 5000member local 507 in cleveland has since replaced presser 
as president of the ohio conference of teamsters 
friedman is charged with two counts of labor racketeering two 
of embezzlement and two of filing false reports with the department 
of labor 
anthony hughes 52 recording secretary at the local faces two 
counts of labor racketeering and one of embezzlement 
they and presser were indicted may 16 1986 
the indictment alleges that four men were hired and paid more 
than 700000 while doing no work for the union hughes is alleged 
to have been one of the socalled ghosts getting paid by 
bakery workers local 19 in cleveland a close affiliate of 
teamsters local 507 allen friedman george argie and jack nardi 
were identified in the indictment as teamsters local 507 ghosts 
since the indictment the justice department has revealed that 
presser and hughes had been fbi informants providing information 
about the union and possible links to organized crime 
two fbi agents based in cleveland in 1985 gave sworn statements 
during an fbi internal investigation that presser was authorized to 
place certain people on the local 507 payroll in order to protect 
his informant status 
paul j cambria jr friedmans attorney said in opening 
statements that the bylaws of local 507 give its 
secretarytreasurer full authority to hire business agents and 
assign them their duties presser was the locals secretary 
treasurer cambria said friedman was its president 
but pressers gone hes not here to talk about what he told 
my client and others and in this case thats a crime and that my 
client is here on trial is a crime cambria said 
cambria told the jury friedman had nothing to do with presser 
relationship with the fbi 
allen friedman argie and nardi are expected to testify for the 
government said prosecutor stephen jigger head of the cleveland 
office of the justice departments strike force against organized 
crime 
jigger said in his opening statement that testimony will reveal 
that presser and hughes set up a sham defense in 1985 with the 
help of an fbi agent in an attempt to block an embezzlement 
prosecution 
very simply this case is about the abuse of union office by 
jackie presser harold friedman and anthony hughes by paying in 
excess of 700000 to people who did no work jigger said 
detailed defense demands for government documents plus pressers 
health problems resulted in repeated delays of the trial which 
us district judge george white originally scheduled to start more 
than a year ago 
jurors were selected friday

the effort to free two whales trapped by 
bitter cold and shifting ice in the high arctic has taken on a life 
of its own and costs are climbing 
many of those involved in the attempt seem reluctant to discuss 
the tab but it appears substantial upward of 600000 by late 
monday 
increasing numbers of agencies and companies from the alaska 
army national guard to the oil industry to a custom sewing company 
in california have donated time or equipment in the past two 
weeks now two soviet icebreakers are involved 
rear admiral sigmund petersen of the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration said monday that all agencies involved 
in the attempt were determined to continue until the endangered 
california gray whales are freed but he admitted he had personal 
concerns 
there are a lot of expenditures being made i understand 
that he said somehow it may have gotten out of control we 
decided at the very beginning that there was a need for saving 
these whales they were caught here and stranded and noaa has 
responsibility for endangered species 
noaa biologist ron morris was asked to come up here to 
evaluate the situation an offer was made to move this hover 
barge over here he said then there was one offer after 
another that wasnt turned down all of a sudden we were in a 
massive type of operation 
north slope borough officials said that as of friday their 
outlay had topped 300000 spokeswoman marie adams said the 
borough was asking for donations to a special fund to offset the 
expenses 
a lot of people are calling in with their pledges but they 
arent sending checks she said were getting the phone calls 
but not the checks 
she said she knew of only one 100 check being received it 
takes a while for the mail to get up here she said but she said 
she was not optimistic 
veco inc an oil field construction and service company 
donated use of the 3 million hoverbarge first employed in the 
rescue attempt that effort was abandoned six miles offshore near 
prudhoe bay when army national guard helicopters could not tow the 
craft over coastal mud shallow water and sand bars 
the national guard usually charges 1500 to 3000 an hour for 
use of its ch54 skycrane helicopters officials said the guard 
said that because of the ongoing nature of the operation there was 
no estimate of the hours the helicopter has flown in the 
hoverbarge operation or in later efforts to smash holes in the ice 
near the whales 
veco on saturday donated an icebreaking tractor to the effort 
weve got a ballpark number you know without figuring the 
hoverbarge or the tractor just out of pocket of about 150000 
to 200000 in this said bill allen chairman of the companys 
board of directors 
efforts to recover the veco barge were underway monday 
arco alaska inc supplied fuel for the barge and the helicopters 
and provided living quarters for the national guard in prudhoe bay 
we dont have a figure yet said company spokeswoman veronica 
dent those costs are still coming in 
standard alaska production co provided heaters tow cable 
manpower and a chain saw mechanic at barrow the company also 
fabricated poles to push ice out of breathing holes but there was 
no estimate of standards costs 
omark industries inc has donated at least 10500 in chain saws 
and saw chains 
the tractor donated by veco was ferried to barrow from prudhoe 
bay aboard an air force c5a the largest plane in the us 
military inventory the c5 flew about 4 hours carrying the 
equipment at almost 6500 an hour and some change that makes 
about 30000 said capt tom dolney of the military airlift 
command at scott air force base ill 
petersen estimated his agency has spent about 6000 on the 
operation

former gen ariel sharon who was forced out as 
defense minister in 1983 after massacres of palestinians in 
lebanon said monday he wants the job back and will crush the 
revolt in the occupied lands if he gets it 
israeli soldiers opened fire on stonethrowers monday in the 
west banks faraa refugee camp killing a 17yearold palestinian 
hospital officials said 
mohammed shaheeds death raised to at least 302 the number of 
arabs killed since the uprising began dec 8 among the 15 million 
palestinians of the west bank and gaza strip six israelis also 
have been slain 
sharon a hero of the 1973 arabisraeli war was touring an 
outdoor market when he expressed his desire to regain his old post 
the area is a stronghold of prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
conservative likud bloc for which sharon is a candidate in the 
nov 1 parliamentary elections 
after the elections the first thing that must be done is to 
restore peace and quiet immediately in the occupied territories 
said sharon who had a heavy guard of riot police 
that is what has to be done and i have the means to do it 
he told reporters 
dozens of vegetable vendors and shoppers in the crowded mahane 
yehuda market cheered and showered the former general with candy 
and kisses they called youre our man and only you can end 
the intefadeh using the arabic word for uprising 
yitzhak rabin now is defense minister he is a former prime 
minister and represents the labor party which is in a fractious 
coalition with likud and is led by shamirs rival foreign minister 
shimon peres 
the uprising and the future of the occupied territories have 
become major election issues they filled most of the time sunday 
night in the only televised debate between shamir and peres 
two independent newspaper polls said monday that peres won the 
debate but labor and likud are generally considered to be about 
even in the contest for the 120 seats in the knesset israels 
parliament 
the daily haaretz said 21 percent of 400 israelis telephoned 
after the debate said peres won and 12 percent said shamir was the 
victor 
yediot ahronot said it interviewed 460 people and peres was 
rated highest on economic and peacerelated issues most israeli 
analysts say however that the effect of the debate on the 
election is expected to be martinal 
peres cut a tour of the northern town of hadera short monday 
after likud supporters shouted him down peres shouted back angrily 
several times but finally left hadera 
sharon said on his hourlong visit to the the market that i 
certainly can be one of those who can do the job well as defense 
minister if likud wins the election 
he resigned as defense minister in 1983 when israeli forces 
were occupying lebanon after an inquiry found him indirectly 
responsible for the massacre of hundreds of palestinians in the 
sabra and chatilla refugee camps by lebanese militiamen allied with 
israel 
he has been industry and trade minister since 1984 and has made 
a political comeback but has been staying out of the election 
spotlight 
moshe behagon sharons spokesman said recent trips abroad for 
trade talks were the reason for his few appearances but party 
officials said likud wanted to avoid reminding voters of the 
unpopular lebanon war 
a likud official suggested privately that sharons silence was 
part of a power struggle with moshe arens who is the likud 
campaign manager and also wants to be defense minister 
some reports say sharon had been asked to make more appearances 
because likud surveys showed many of the blocs supporters were 
leaning toward small parties of the extreme right because of the 
palestinian rebellion 
political observers say sharon stands a fairly good chance of 
becoming defense minister his main competition is arens although 
arens is shamirs closest aide in the government shamir may prefer 
giving the job to sharon to avoid stirring political discontent 
in mondays clashes seven palestinians were wounded one in the 
west bank town of nablus and six in the gaza strip arab hospital 
officials reported 
officials at nasser hospital in khan yunis said a 7yearold boy 
was shot in the chest and transferred in serious condition to tel 
avivs tel hashomer hospital 
one victim in gaza was a 6yearold girl hit in the leg 
apparently by a stray plastic bullet according to doctors at shifa 
hospital in gaza city

some offerings in the brooklyn academy of 
musics annual next wave festival are avantgarde and some reach 
for the far out 
the warrior ant opening production of the sixth season is 
one of the latter there is an audience for big elaborate stage 
devices rockconcertloud music and general oddness this is the 
audience which also must be able to swallow large helpings of 
muddle and pretentiousness for the warrior ant 
the threehour show already seen at the spoleto festival in 
charleston in philadelphia and at yale university opened sunday 
night at the brooklyn academys majestic theater 
act 1 is like a mardi gras it starts with a metal toy ant 
scooting out onto the stage a narrator in a periwig says on the 
sixth day there was created crawling things and it was good he 
goes on to explain that ants are conceived on one night of the 
year known as funky tuesday and that like bees drones die and 
queens live 
most of this long act is very busy with floats atop small cars 
choreographed break dancers steeldrum bands and amplified 
caribbeanstyle singing with the words not understood lengthy 
narration intended as an epic poem is vacuous with pretentious 
literary wording usually ending in a now zinger such as 
he blew me away 
a tall metal ant standing upright legs waving is wheeled on 
for the finale from its innards comes a japanese doll the title 
character 
in act 2 the ant and a worm manipulated by bunraku puppeteers 
yoshida tamamatsu and kanju kiritake and five assistants go 
through the path of least resistance in a forgotten circle of 
hell where artists reside steel drummers and a string quartet 
provide accompaniment for this and some bellydancing after a few 
snipes via a narrator at artists the ant finds his father a 
termite and they have an existentialist conversation thats fairly 
hard to follow 
in act 3 the ant falls in love with a death moth there are 
songs and narration which here becomes so flowery and rococo it is 
funny 
the warrior ant is the first time the osaka japan bunraku 
puppet theater has collaborated on a western project development 
of the play began in 1984 lee breuer liza lorwin and bob telson 
who developed the gospel at colonus which told the oedipus 
story in gospel music and drew parallels with jesus produced 
breuer directed in brooklyn mabou mines in a coproducer they 
plan a 12hour 12part epic with more episodes of the ants life 
since a viewers reaction after seeing the three finished parts 
is that of having seen something silly they might consider turning 
to something else

the navy captain whose ship shot down a 
civilian aircraft over the persian gulf disputed a pentagon 
reports suggestion that stress played a role in the tragedy as 
the crew arrived monday for an emotional homecoming 
there of course were mistakes made and there always are in 
an intense combat environment capt will c rogers iii said at a 
news conference but both my crew and the system performed 
basically as designed no particular mistake was critical to the 
engagement decision its my opinion that stress was not a 
factor during the entire engagement proceedings 
the official pentagon report concluded the crew of the uss 
vincennes mistook the airliner for an iranian f14 fighter jet on 
july 3 resulting in the deaths of all 290 people aboard it said 
crew members misinterpreted computer and radar data because of 
stress in their first combat situation at the time the vincennes 
was engaged in a firefight with several iranian gunboats 
mondays return of the aegisclass cruiser marked the end of a 
sixmonth deployment for the crew of the vincennes named for a 
revolutionary war battle near vincennes 
were glad to be home i assure you of that this is a nice 
place said rogers who earlier got a kiss a hug and flowers 
from his wife sharon 
after a brief welcoming ceremony featuring william rose mayor 
of vincennes ind and rep bill lowery rcalif of san diego 
the 380 sailors poured off the ship into a sea of relatives 
friends and navy colleagues 
one woman held a sign that read i love you beefcake 
collins a little girl waved to her father and said hi daddy 
youre home one sailor bolted down the gangway crying hi 
mom and gave his mother a hug 
i dont even know what we were doing there its a tragedy 
that it happened but im glad im home and im alive said petty 
officer 3rd class steve hile of niles mich who got a warm 
embrace from his girlfriend vallita lawwill 
rogers said the fate of the uss stark on which 37 sailors died 
in an iraqi missile attack was in the back of his mind throughout 
the vincennes deployment 
no skipper sails in the persian gulf without the stark at 
least in your subconscious rogers said was it a factor during 
that decision process i dont consciously remember 
in response to a question from an iranian reporter rogers said 
he regretted the loss of civilian life asked if there were lessons 
in the tragedy he said we wish we had 100 percent hindsight 
thats not a luxury you have in combat 
the captain said that he knew within 1 hours after ordering two 
missiles fired that the target destroyed was a civilian airliner 
rogers said he later assembled the crew to tell them the news and 
that they took it quietly 
at first we were all devastated rogers said it goes 
without saying but i have to look at it and my crew looks at it 
that given the fact that the airliner made no indication that it 
was not a hostile craft we had no other choice 
so our grief and our despair over that is tempered by the 
knowledge that we did what we had to do when we had to do it i 
reviewed those few seconds one hundred times one thousand times 
my decision was correct 
navy chaplain ted atwood who visited the crew from sept 27 to 
oct 5 and talked frequently with the families of crew members 
said many sailors came to grips with the tragedy on the way home 
when i was on board i did not see a single depressed 
sailor atwood said of course the loss of lives is grievous 
in any situation i think they absorbed it and they have dealt with 
it and they have grown beyond that grievous incident

two soviet icebreakers steamed toward us 
waters to join the drive to save two stranded whales monday while 
rescuers appeared to lose ground in their efforts to coax the 
imprisoned mammals toward freedom 
biologists stopped cutting new breathing holes through the 
beaufort sea ice monday evening after the whales apparently 
spooked by a shoal headed back toward the shoreline where they 
have been trapped for more than two weeks 
with eskimo crews providing the backbreaking labor biologists 
switched tactics in the frustrating effort to get the whales 
through the shallow water 
first they connected a series of intermittent breathing holes 
to form a single open channel some 600 yards long 
instead of pushing the ice blocks back under the adjacent ice 
the eskimos used long poles to guide the miniature icebergs to the 
rear of the slot 
the idea was to try to keep the whales from reversing their 
course toward the nearest open water 
initially the strategy worked the whales would swim back and 
forth between the edge of the shoal and the rear of the iceclogged 
channel 
theyre doing what theyre supposed to said federal whale 
biologist david withrow as the backfilling operation forced the 
whales toward the shoal 
but when the channel behind them was almost completely filled 
the whales reversed course struggling up through the large slabs 
of ice and thick slush 
its discouraging withrow said as the whales began 
surfacing farther and farther back from the shoal why come back 
here when they know its open up there 
the california gray whales must get over the shoal and through 
the ice ridge to reach an open lead or pathway through the ice 
the nearest completely open water is 200 miles away in the chukchi 
sea 
the ridge formed by the collision of two ice masses is a 
jumble of ice chunks some the size of small houses it stretches 
for miles and at points is a quartermile wide and looms 15 feet 
above sea level said rear adm sigmund r petersen director of 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administrations pacific 
marine center in seattle 
biologists said they were considering the possibility they might 
have to airlift the animals to open water 
were having a net built right now to carry them withrow 
said sunday 
but he emphasized that an airlift was the least preferred 
alternative to be used only if all else fails because the whales 
could be injured smaller whales have been captured but not in the 
midst of ice fields 
the whales stranded about 100 yards offshore more than two 
weeks ago by shifting ice about 13 miles northeast of barrow were 
about four miles from the ice ridge petersen said a third whale 
disappeared friday and is presumed dead 
were preparing to go out there and take a look at the 
ridge petersen said we have some expertise here on ice and 
icebreaking were going to look at that and be prepared to speak 
to the soviet ships 
the icebreakers requested by greenpeace usa the environmental 
group and by the state department and noaa were moving at about 
seven knots and expected to arrive during the night 
the captain of the seattlebased coast guard icebreaker polar 
sea capt joseph j mcclelland jr was expected in barrow to work 
as a liaison officer with the soviets 
it was hoped that at least one of the soviet vessels would be 
able to breach the ice ridge called a pressure ridge at its 
narrowest point we think they can reach the pressure ridge but 
there is a question of whether the big one can go in there 
petersen said 
the larger of the two vessels the admiral makorov is 443 feet 
long and needs about 35 feet of water to operate he said the 
smaller vessel the icebreaking cargo ship vladimir arseniev

gov richard celeste on monday toned down his 
demand that a federally owned uranium processing plant be closed 
until something is done to stop the pollution it creates 
celeste urged instead that the nuclear weapons plants 
production workers be involved in a cleanup of the site near 
fernald 18 miles northwest of cincinnati 
celeste spoke at a news conference where he appeared with 
leaders of a coalition of 14 striking employees unions at the 
plant known officially as the feed materials production center 
last tuesday celeste sent president reagan a letter demanding a 
shutdown of the plant until measures could be taken to ensure the 
health and safety of employees and residents but that same day 
sen john glenn dohio disagreed with celeste and said the 
department of energy is more likely to proceed with cleaning up 
radioactive wastes on the plants 1050acre site if the facility 
stays in operation 
the governor said he would not want to see the energy department 
abandon the plant doe officials said last week they have no plans 
to close the plant and have already begun a 10year 500 million 
program to clean up and modernize it 
i shudder to think what would happen if the department of 
energy tried to wash its hands of this facility celeste said 
we know that a cleanup can be accomplished and the people best 
to do it are the people who work there 
the plant has been widely criticized since the doe admitted in 
january 1985 that at least 200000 pounds of radioactive uranium 
oxide dust have been released into the atmosphere from the plant 
during its 37 years of operation 
celeste said he sent a telegram monday to energy secretary john 
herrington requesting a meeting to review the federal plans and 
timetable for cleaning up the plant site the department received 
the telegram in washington but herrington had no immediate response 
on when such a meeting might occur department spokesman tom bauman 
said 
the state of ohio has had a lawsuit pending against the energy 
department since 1985 accusing it of polluting air and water at 
the site state officials and environmentalists are worried that 
radioactive runoff from the plant could threaten the underground 
great miami river aquifer which supplies water for businesses and 
some southwestern ohio communities

nicaragua is asking the general assembly 
once again to condemn the united states for ignoring a world court 
ruling that bars us aid to nicaraguan rebels 
nicaragua also is protesting what it says is us interference 
in its domestic affairs 
the nicaraguan resolution identical to one submitted last year 
and marking the third consecutive year nicaragua makes the request 
says all states are obliged under international law not to 
intervene in the internal affairs of other states 
the general assembly will consider the agenda item sometime next 
month 
us aid to nicaraguan rebels known as contras is seen by many 
nations as a violation of the principle of noninterference and of 
the june 17 1986 ruling by the international court of justice 
the court the central un legal body ruled against the united 
states regarding us military and financial aid to the contras 
under the un charter all member states agree to abide by the 
decisions of the world court 
but the united states often has ignored the court and its 
rulings when they run counter to what washington perceives to be 
us interests 
this years nicaraguan resolution urgently demands full and 
immediate us compliance with the court ruling 
the 159nation general assembly has overwhelmingly voted each 
year since 1986 to support nicaragua and uphold the world court 
ruling the vote last year was 942 with 48 abstentions and the 
remainder absent the united states and israel voted no

michael dukakis an underdog running short of time accused 
george bush on monday of resorting to outright lies to avoid 
real issues bush replied that democrats are desperate and said 
dukakis is soft on crime and defense and thats the inescapable 
truth 
there was no letup in a white house campaign never noted for 
civility 
hitler would have loved these people democratic rep 
richard gephardt said of the republicans as he campaigned for 
dukakis 
with 15 days until election day bush and running mate dan 
quayle were doing their best to protect a lead in the national 
public opinion polls dukakis and ticketmate lloyd bentsen looked 
for a way to catch fire however belatedly 
maybe with the benefit of hindsight i should have tried to 
respond earlier to republican attacks dukakis said in an 
appearance on the larry king show on cable news network 
when asked by king whether he had a good shot of winning 
dukakis replied i think weve got a shot 
dukakis also said he was caught by surprise by the nature of 
presidential campaigning after the democratic national convention 
and he said the furor over the selection of quayle took away 
attention from his campaign as well 
i was campaigning but a lot of attention was devoted to the 
gop convention and then there was about three weeks of deafening 
noise about the quayle selection wich made it very difficult to 
get through he said 
what you find out at the convention is that youre suddenly in 
a very different world he said who says what for 45 seconds 
on the 6 oclock news makes the difference in a particular day and 
it took a while to understand that 
he appeared to be doing his best to make up for lost time 
for example dukakis told national public radio in an interview 
i agree with bentsen that the republican campaign contained 
elements of racism 
and from a sparsely attended appearance in los angeles to a 
speech before a throng of 10000 in san diego dukakis carried his 
latecampaign populist theme through the nations biggest state he 
said bush would personally receive a 22000ayear tax break from 
his proposal to cut the capital gains tax 
george bush wants to give people like george bush a tax break 
thats more than the average california worker makes in a year 
dukakis said in los angeles look in the mirror and ask yourself 
is george bush on your side 
bush at a rally in williston vt defended his tax proposal as 
good for creating new jobs he said dukakis is likely to raise 
taxes and the nation could face an economic disaster if the 
liberals take over the white house 
campaigning through new england bush made an unusual departure 
from his prepared speech to reject dukakis charges of campaign 
distortions and deceptions he said he could document allegations 
in television advertisements criticizing a massachusetts prison 
furlough program and his rivals record on defense 
there are signs showing in the opposition camp of desperation 
using ads that accuse us of lies he said the record on 
the essential opposition the opposition to these military 
programs is no lie and he is upset not because its false 
but because he is weak on crime and defense and thats the 
inescapable truth 
the vice presidential candidates added their voices to the 
rising chorus 
bentsen renewed his weekend claim that republicans were guilty 
of racist advertising particularly in their attempts to depict 
dukakis as soft on crime 
they are obviously dealing with a black man who in that 
instance had raped a white woman and that certainly came through 
in the ad he said of the case of willie horton the 
massachusetts prisoner who escaped while on furlough and brutalized 
a maryland couple asked what came through bentsen said 
racism 
quayle rebutted that charge as totally absurd as he 
campaigned in missouri i think it shows just how desperate they 
really are to start fanning the fires of racism he said 
there was no disagreement about which side was ahead in the race 
a fresh poll in wisconsin showed the two men in a virtual tie a 
big gain for bush from an earlier survey reliably republican 
nebraska was running true to form in another survey that showed 
bush in the lead by 25 points 
and in california where dukakis was campaigning bush was ahead 
11 points the poll prepared for tuesdays editions of the los 
angeles times showed bush leading 53 percent tp 42 percent 
the times polled 1376 registered voters during the fours days 
that ended sunday the margin of error was four percentage points 
with congress adjourned for the year the surrogate campaigners 
were out in force gephardt included 
this has really been a campaign thats practiced the politics 
of illusion and delusion the missouri congressman said of the 
republicans accusing them of halftruths and lies about 
dukakis 
if the reality is not what you want you rearrange it hitler 
would have loved these people 
for the most part the days campaigning reflected dukakis hope 
that the voters were ready to take a second look at george bush 
and me if given a reason 
a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is 
till putting on its shoes the democrat quoted mark twain he 
said bush cant win an election where the real issues are 
discussed 
but bush said dukakis was trying to deflect attention from the 
republican record of economic success 
in waterbury conn he said democrats contend that the 
american people are rallying to our cause because we make better tv 
ads they miss the whole point the american people have chosen 
us to lead because of our principles not personalities

there have been meetings this morning but at this point no 
settlement has been reached

michael dukakis said monday that george 
bushs proposal to reduce capital gains taxes would present a 
22000ayear tax break to the republican candidate himself 
the democratic nominee pressing his assertion that a bush 
presidency would benefit the wealthiest americans said george 
bush wants to give people like himself a tax break thats more in 
some cases than the average worker in california makes in a year 
dukakis campaigned the length of california during the day in a 
bid for the states mostinthenation 47 electoral votes he also 
waged an effort to battle back nationally through television 
interviews and purchases of network air time 
a new poll indicated he had his work cut out for him in that 
state the poll prepared for tuesdays editions of the los angeles 
times showed bush leading 53 percent tp 42 percent 
the times polled 1376 registered voters during the fours days 
that ended sunday the margin of error was four percentage points 
in a speech to supporters at a halffilled scottish rite temple 
in los angeles dukakis renewed in his sharpest terms yet his 
criticism of bushs proposal to reduce the tax rate on capital 
gains from a maximum of 33 percent to 15 percent dukakis says 
capital gains profits gained from sales of property such as 
stocks or real estate are primarily a concern of the wealthy and 
that bushs proposal is a break for the rich 
consider a taxpayer who reported 515132 in capital gains 
over the last three years dukakis said suppose he reports the 
same amount over the next three if the vice presidents new tax 
plan is accepted that taxpayer will get an annual tax break of 
more than 22000 
and whats the name of that taxpayer george herbert walker 
bush 
dukakis aides said the democrat reported no capital gains during 
the past three years 
sheila tate bushs press secretary said when asked about 
dukakis comments were going to stick to our agenda and were 
not going to worry about anklebiting by the opposition 
bush in a speech delivered before dukakis made his remarks 
said in portland maine i will push for a cut in the capital 
gains tax for a very simple reason its not to favor the rich it 
will help create jobs 
he said my opponent calls this typically a tax cut for the 
rich hes wrong hes dead wrong 
dukakis struck a populist note in california saying repeatedly 
that he was fighting for average people 
the massachusetts governor also pressed his contention that the 
bush campaign has distorted his record recalling mark twains line 
that a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth 
is still putting on its shoes 
mr bush must have read mark twain dukakis said because 
hes running a campaign based on distortions and distrations and 
outright lies why because he cant win an election where the real 
issues are discussed 
later in san diego he repeated that theme as he spoke to a 
crowd estimated by police at 10000 people at horton plaza 
spectators crowded elevated walkways and filled windows to catch a 
glimpse 
dukakis shook hands along a sidewalk jammed with people where 
one enthusiastic woman outstretched her arm and stroked him on the 
back of the head in a show of affection prompting secret service 
agents to quickly move her arm away 
weve seen a campaign of distortions and misrepresentation and 
of outright lies now for many many months dukakis told the 
crowd in denouncing republican campaigning 
dukakis was accompanied in his campaigning by actress daryl 
hannah 
after appearances in los angeles burbank and san diego dukakis 
had later appearances in the northern california cities of san 
francisco hayward and san leandro 
aides said dukakis would return next weekend to california a 
mustwin state for him 
trailing in national polls dukakis said he believed american 
voters were dissatisfied with the tenor of the campaign so far and 
were ready to take a hard second look at george bush and me 
he was trying to take his case to voters through television 
interviews he was appearing on the larry king show monday night 
in a segment taped two days earlier on tuesday night he was being 
interviewed live on abcs nightline program for 90 minutes 
on the larry king show dukakkis said maybe with the benefit 
of hindsight i should have tried to respond earlier to the 
negative ads he said the message about what candidates would do 
for the future has been obscured by ads about furloughs and 
tanks 
on the question of likability he said you can be 
passionately competent 
press secretary dayton duncan said the dukakis campaign had 
purchased five minutes of time tuesday night on nbc and would have 
another network appearance sunday night and again the saturday 
before the election dukakis has purchased 30 minutes for election 
eve on all three networks duncan said

democratic vice presidential 
candidate lloyd bentsen stumping in gerald fords old 
congressional district attacked what he called racist 
republican advertising monday as appealing to the lowest instincts 
of the electorate 
the texas senator also told local businesmen that sticking with 
gop policies was not good enough in a changing world that includes 
a decline of the russian empire 
on sunday bentsen agreed in response to a question by a tv 
interviewer that the bush campaign was making a racist appeal in 
its attacks on democratic nominee michael dukakis as being soft on 
crime 
talking to reporters monday bentsen cited the gops focus on 
the case of convicted murderer willie horton jr who raped a 
maryland woman and slashed her fiance last year after horton had 
escaped from a massachusetts prison furlough 
they are obviously dealing with a black man who in that 
instance had raped a white woman and that certainly came through 
in the ad said bentsen asked what came through he replied 
racism 
and in little rock ark monday night bentsen told a black 
congregation at the greater paradise baptist church that the 
republicans bear false witness against michael dukakis and were 
gong to set that record straight 
the truth is catching up he said and the power of the 
truth will prevail he said 
bentsen did not mention the issue of race but he received an 
enthusiastic welcome from the congregation the church resonated 
from the voices of two choirs and bentsen joined in for a rousing 
rendition of the battle hymn of the republic 
bishop lt walker a visiting preacher who presided over the 
rally told the proverb about how for the want of a nail a battle 
was lost the duke can ride with lloyd bentsen at his side he 
concluded 
in a speech before the grand rapids economic club bentsen said 
the democrats recognized the tough international competition 
american business faces today 
with new products coming to the market such as highdefinition 
television japanese and european industries are cooperating but 
american businesses are operating on their own he said 
complicating that situation he said i think were going to 
see a continuation of the decline of the russian empire which 
must be handled with caution 
he and dukakis would offer a creative partnership between 
business and government not an industrial policy bentsen said 
asked by reporters to elaborate on his statement about the 
soviets bentsen said we see their economy in a shambles and 
people demanding something be done about the standard of living and 
that they have a reasonable amount of consumer goods 
you see them backing off around the world and you see the 
american economic system being adopted more and more in other 
countries youre seeing a serious decline setting in on the 
russian empire he said 
we have to handle that with considerable care he added 
there is a tendency when one is going into a decline for the 
military to strike out its important that we keep our defenses 
strong during that process 
bentsen received a polite reception from the michigan luncheon 
crowd in the republican western part of the state democrats are 
trailing in the race for michigans 20 electoral votes by some 7 to 
9 points in recent polls and its one of the states in which they 
hope to stage a comeback 
from grand rapids bentsen flew to cape girardeau mo where he 
toured a clothing factory he viewed computeroperated cutting and 
plotting machines that aid in the manufacture of mens suit coats 
and blazers and then addressed employees 
bentsen did not mention the racism charges in his address but 
referred to the furlough program as one of many distortions the 
republicans were peddling

gen michel aoun who heads the christian 
cabinet in lebanons rival governments said monday that syrias 
refusal to recognize him makes it an occupation power 
police reported three people killed and four wounded monday in 
sporadic exchanges of mortar and gunfire between moslem druse 
militiamen and christian units of the army in the hills overlooking 
beirut 
the victims were civilians apparently caught in the crossfire in 
aley near the hilltop town of souk elgharb seven miles southeast 
of beirut 
on saturday two people were killed and four wounded in a 
threehour clash in the same area 
fears have risen that lebanons 13yearold civil war between 
christians and moslems would flare up as a constitutional crisis 
deepened sectarian divisions threatening to split lebanon into 
ministates 
syrias failure to recognize the constitutional cabinet means 
it does not recognize lebanons constitution which further means 
that syria has declared itself as an occupation power aoun told 
reporters 
aoun 52 a maronite catholic was named by former president 
amin gemayel to head an interim military cabinet just minutes 
before gemayels sixyear term ended on sept 22 parliament had 
failed to elect a new head of state to succeed gemayel 
moslems and leftists allied with syria have rejected aouns 
cabinet and pledged allegiance to acting prime minister salim hoss 
who heads what was left of the government installed during 
gemayels term 
syria which has 40000 troops stationed in 70 percent of 
lebanons 4035squaremile territory has branded aoun a 
military usurper of power 
syria has no right whatsoever to reject the cabinet aoun 
said 
as a neighboring country it has the right to withhold support 
and even to be in dispute with the cabinet but to withhold 
recognition is a different matter of grave seriousness 
iraq syrias archrival in the arab world called on the arab 
league monday to ensure that lebanons parliament meets to elect a 
new president and end the constitutional crisis 
christian deputies have boycotted parliamentary sessions and no 
president from among the syrianbacked candidates the main 
contenders could be chosen without a quorum 
in a statement broadcast by baghdad radio iraqi foreign 
minister tareq aziz called action by parliament imperative in 
order to elect a new president for this arab country 
his statement followed a report by the christian voice of 
lebanon radio that the united arab emirates asked the arab league 
to convene an emergency summit to discuss the lebanese crisis 
under an unwritten covenant dating from lebanons independence 
from france in 1943 the presidency goes to the maronites the 
premiership to sunni and the speakership of parliament to shiite 
moslems 
iraq has recognized aouns cabinet it is the only country to 
have done so in a move clearly designed to antagonize damascus 
it has also armed the christians main militia the lebanese 
forces which opposes syria

a courtappointed doctor has concluded that 
billionaire real estate magnate harry b helmsley has memory and 
reasoning problems that would impair his standing trial on tax 
evasion charges it was disclosed monday 
us district judge john walker who revealed the doctors 
findings at a pretrial hearing said he would determine the 
79yearold helmsleys fitness to stand trial at another hearing in 
december 
helmsley and his wife leona 67 were indicted april 15 on 
state and federal charges of evading taxes on almost 4 million in 
income by passing it off as business expenses 
helmsleys lawyers have contended he was unfit to stand trial 
because of memory problems and they are seeking to have him severed 
from the case four of five medical experts who have examined him 
have concurred that his memory is impaired according to court 
papers 
walker appointed dr martin l albert professor of neurology at 
boston universitys school of medicine to examine helmsley 
walker revealed alberts conclusion that helmsley could not 
substantially assist in his defense because of memory 
difficulties and difficulties in reasoning and difficulties in 
problem solving in new and rapidly shifting settings 
among other things albert concluded helmsley would not be 
cognitively fit to respond to a hostile cross examination 
at the request of prosecutors walker said he would hold a 
hearing on helmsleys fitness to stand trial dec 19 
assistant us attorney james devita said that if walker found 
by a preponderance of the evidence that helmsley was unable to 
assist his own defense the government would not object to 
removing the aging billionaire from the trial 
walker also rescheduled the trials start from jan 16 to jan 
23 
helmsley and his 67yearold wife are charged with disguising 4 
million in renovations to their greenwich conn mansion as 
business expenses and taking bogus tax deductions

some consumer advocates have been asking the 
government to take its monthly reports comparing airline ontime 
performance another step and issue a comparison on how each airline 
ranks on safety 
the idea may sound fine at first blush but is complicated by 
the fact that the transportation department and its federal 
aviation administration have yet to figure out what indicators give 
an accurate reading on safety 
the faa earlier this year hired the flight safety foundation a 
private consulting firm to develop some criteria that might be 
used to gauge aviation safety 
faa administrator allan mcartor said he wanted a kind of dow 
jones index of safety to tell whether the airways actually are 
becoming more or less safe 
the consultants are going beyond raw accident statistics and 
rates they are examining air traffic controller errors 
nearcollision reports runway incidents among other things 
but faa officials suggest even when the index is found its 
unlikely any attempt will be made to use it to rank airlines on the 
basis of safety 
such a move would likely be vigorously opposed by the airlines 
it doesnt make much sense says bill jackman a spokesman 
for the air transport association he said it would be difficult 
if not impossible to compare on safety grounds airlines that fly 
in vastly different weather and air traffic conditions 
the general accounting office the investigative arm of 
congress earlier this year was asked to examine whether the 
government should develop an airline ranking system based on safety 
while such a ranking might be desirable the gao said it could 
not find any performance indicators that are currently usable to 
compare objectively the safety levels of individual airlines 
it said that there is some agreement among aviation safety 
experts that such areas as pilot competence quality of maintenance 
and financial stablility as well as management attitude toward 
compliance with federal regulations could be used in comparing the 
airlines safety record 
but it said neither the faa nor its parent transportation 
department has enough such information available to be of use

upward pressure on rents is likely to occur in 
the near future and if that is so you may expect a rise in demands 
for rent controls 
one without the other has been rare in recent years and nothing 
seems likely to change that relationship some people will always 
be for rent control and others will oppose it seldom can they 
speak civilly to each other 
the usual fireworks may be expected therefore as pressure 
builds on the rental market a consequence of reduced tax benefits 
for owners and builders and a proliferation of local restrictions 
on new construction 
recognizing the emerging situation the nonprofit 
independentminded urban land institute commissioned an 
evaluation by anthony downs a senior fellow at the brookings 
institution he comes down hard against controls 
downs contends in his recently released volume that controls 
inhibit new rental construction cause existing units to 
deteriorate faster and actually impose disadvantages on those who 
are thought to benefit 
it is a conventional finding and it is likely to be treated 
conventionally by those opposed philosophically or morally to 
freemarket rents 
its impact is likely to be diminished even further be its 
sponsorhip which includes the national multi housing council the 
building owners and managers association international and the 
national association of realtors 
nevertheless it has much to say about the subject that is 
worthwhile especially in view of the likelihood that reductions in 
rental construction plus a tendency toward rent inflation will 
resurrect the debate 
though the subject lies dormant now there are more than 200 
communities with some form of residential rent controls most 
adopted during periods of rapid general inflation in the 1970s and 
most in the northeast and california 
do they work for some and for a limited time it seems but 
downs contends that in the long run they impose two major 
disadvantages upon those who are supposed to be the major 
beneficiaries lowincome households 
first he says controls increase rather than decrease the 
discretionary power of owners by intensifying tenant competition 
for vacant units 
says downs owners then tend to choose higherincome tenants 
over poor ones since the former pose less risk owners also 
discriminate against tenants on the basis of race ethnicity age 
and number of children 
then he contends controls may increase homelessness by 
reducing the available supply of rental housing and thus the 
access of the poor to that supply 
these contentions are likely to play a big role in the arguments 
to come because already there is a serious shortage of lowincome 
housing 
according to downs in 1983 the number of renter households for 
whom 250 or less represented 30 percent of income was 12 million 
at the same time the number of units priced at 250 or less per 
month was 875 million 
harsh as that reality was it has grown worse since then says 
downs and that brings up the question of how to handle the 
problem by imposing rent controls to temporarily assist while 
worsening the longterm problem or by allowing freemarket rents 
which eventually bring more units on market 
philosophically there is probably no meeting ground for those 
at the extremes of this argument no more than there is a common 
interest regarding another aspect of the subject ie the fate of 
landlords 
rent controls obviously impose economic losses upon the owners 
of rental housing units penalties that no other participants in 
the economic community are expected to accept 
owners of controlled units for instance may be forced to take 
operating expenses from their own pockets in effect denying their 
own families the market value of the property declines their 
investment can even be wiped out 
landlords legitimately ask therefore if attempts at fair play 
for one member of society should arbitarily be at the expense of 
another rather than of the total community

actress valerie bertinelli had to learn more 
than just her lines to portray aviation pioneer pancho barnes 
barnes was at home not only in the cockpit of an open stunt 
plane but also in the saddle atop galloping horses 
id ridden horses a long time ago but i was always scared and 
never knew how to ride well said bertinelli and she had never 
been up in a small plane 
prior to beginning her role in the threehour movie pancho 
barnes on cbs tonight bertinelli went to the texas location 
site a week early she wanted to practice horseback riding and to 
become acquainted with opencockpit planes 
i spent a lot of time with the wranglers she said i 
really enjoy riding now i was afraid of the horse at first but i 
spent every weekend during the shoot riding the last week i was 
able to able to do my own stunt of riding the horse in a race next 
to the camera car 
she also took her first ride in a small plane i couldnt wait 
to get up she said when i got to the airfield the pilot was 
doing loops and stalls it looked like fun when he landed i had 
him take me up right away it was such an experience i was so 
exhilarated 
the movie also stars sam robards ted wass james stephens 
geoffrey lewis cynthia harris and richard young it was filmed on 
location near dallas 
the beautiful bertinelli was an odd choice to play barnes whom 
test pilot chuck yeager described in his autobiography as one of 
the ugliest women he had ever met 
pancho barnes is probably best known today as the woman who ran 
the watering hole with the wall of photos of dead test pilots in 
the movie the right stuff kim stanley played her in that 1983 
movie but barnes was also an early pilot who competed in womens 
crosscountry air races with amelia earhart and beryl markham she 
organized the stunt pilots association which performs movie 
stunts she trained pilots in world war ii and her ranch later 
became part of edwards air force base 
the movie starts with her introduction to flight in her 
grandfathers hotair balloon he was professor thaddeus sc lowe 
who was appointed by abraham lincoln to head the union armys 
balloon corps in the civil war she shunned more traditional 
feminine pastimes for horseback riding and flying 
she was a woman before her time said bertinelli she led 
her own life she was one of the guys she was respected in her 
circle 
the movie romanticizes barnes it mentions only two marriages 
although barnes had four husbands she married her fourth husband 
gene mac mckendry sam robards after world war ii when he 
was 26 and she was in her mid40s in the film however they meet 
and marry in the 1920s they were divorced in 1968 she died in 
1975 
bertinelli who starred as the kid sister in one day at a 
time was last seen in the miniseries ill take manhattan 
ive just been taking it easy and keeping my eyes open she 
said i dont want to rush into anything im going on the road 
with my husband rock musician eddie van halen until thanksgiving 
and christmas i dont think ill do anything new until next year 
bertinelli has a series commitment from cbs but has not yet 
decided on the concept of the new show a scripts being 
written she said but you never know how its going to turn 
out i want to be very sure before i commit to it 
several movies and miniseries are being written for her 
production company 
the parts get better as you get older said bertinelli i 
enjoy being 28 i dont look 28 but i dont look 19 either im 
not going to play teenagers anymore theyre not as interesting

secrecy is a part of life in 
south africa extending far beyond national security to corporate 
boardrooms athletic fields even cooking contests and a zoo 
directors office 
because of the stigma attached abroad to dealings with south 
africa leaders in government business entertainment and sports 
consider clandestine tactics necessary 
an editorial in business day a johannesburg newspaper said the 
national party government engages in a systematic concealment of 
the truth from the public the idea of simple public accountability 
has decayed so far that not only invasions but even the salaries 
of public servants are concealed 
base salaries of officials are disclosed but extensive 
allowances for homes travel cars and other expenses are not 
peter soal a member of parliament for the antiapartheid 
progressive federal party declared it impossible for the average 
citizen to keep abreast of whats going on 
this penchant for secrets reaches high levels foreign minister 
roelof f botha peeled off for two days during a visit to europe 
with president pw botha who is not related 
i am not prepared to say publicly exactly where i was except 
to say i visited one or two countries in the east or in africa 
he said after rejoining the presidential party 
the government controlled by the white minority claims several 
statesmen from black africa have paid clandestine visits to south 
africa in recent years 
officials also say prominent blacks in south africa have 
negotiated secretly with the government about possible political 
reforms but that identifying them might discredit those leaders in 
the eyes of other blacks 
much of the nations foreign trade is enveloped in secrecy 
particularly when it involves efforts to circumvent economic 
sanctions the government says south africa trades with 40 of the 
50 other african countries but refuses to name them 
statistics on arms imports and exports are secret as is most 
information about energy and the nuclear program 
south africa does not say how much oil it consumes or where it 
comes from disclosing information on how petroleum is obtained has 
been made a crime to protect those supplying oil in violation of a 
un embargo 
the defense act prohibits unauthorized reports about the 
composition and activities of the armed forces statistics on draft 
resistance are not revealed and past incursions into angola have 
been kept secret 
south africa did not confirm its renewed presence in angola last 
year until many weeks after large numbers of troops crossed the 
border military headquarters did not issue comprehensive 
statistics on casualties among its black troops involved in the 
campaign 
members of parliament have the right to ask cabinet ministers 
for information and statistics that might not be disclosed 
otherwise but ministers often refuse to respond on grounds 
disclosure would not be in the national interest 
that answer has become more prevalent lately soal said in 
an interview the nationalists have a passion for secrecy 
emergency regulations forbid unauthorized reports about 
detainees or action by security forces justice minister kobie 
coetzee recently proposed restricting news reports of trials 
because of the extensive international sports boycott foreign 
athletes sometimes arrive using pseudonyms occasionally with the 
cooperation of south african media teams compete without their 
nationality or the names of the players being disclosed 
on many occasions the locations of sports events are not 
announced until foreign competitors are en route to south africa 
and thus less susceptible to lastminute political pressure 
even nonsports competitions can assume a cloakanddagger 
aspect the departure of four young south african chefs for an 
international cooking contest this month was kept secret until the 
eve of their departure 
a white tiger arrived at the pretoria zoo in early october in a 
trade with an american zoo which received a king cheetah zoo 
director willie labuschagne said the zoo in the united states asked 
not to be identified 
foreign film crews produce movies here secretly they like the 
relatively low production costs but want to avoid international 
publicity about the choice of locale 
the star the largestselling daily newspaper recently 
editorialized on the extent of secrecy and concluded it will be 
nice one day to shout from the rooftops again

four decades ago betty brothers 
bought a buginfested swamp between the atlantic ocean and us 
route 1 where she set up camp cooked over an open fire and went 
to work with dynamite 
it was a big swamp it was acreage says the 69yearold 
real estate agent whose pet bottlenose dolphin suwa swims in a 
gated lagoon next to the house which stands on the site today it 
was all under water so we camped dynamited and filled it 
ms brothers knows she wouldnt be allowed to build her dream 
house today progress has brought federal dredgeandfill laws the 
clean water act and a statemandated landuse plan that has 
agitated just about everyone on the 112mile island chain ending at 
key west the southernmost point in the contintental united states 
if i went with a 5gallon bucket of sand or rocks and dumped 
it in my bay bottom what do you suppose could happen to me the 
whitehaired ms brothers asks with a chuckle technically she 
could face federal charges 
the keys were an inspiration to ernest hemingway margaritaville 
to jimmy buffett a home to endangered species from the american 
crocodile to key deer and a launch point to the only living coral 
reef in the continental united states with its worldclass 
sportfishing scuba diving and snorkeling 
the natives a fiercely independent lot that call themselves 
conchs organized a tongueincheek secession move in the early 
1970s to establish the conch republic many of them were only half 
kidding 
the monroe county landuse plan is at the center of a dispute 
between prodevelopment and preservation forces and has strained 
relations between the county and the state ironically it has also 
spurred a construction boom 
theyve got more problems per square inch than any people ive 
run into says rep dante fascell of miami noting problems with 
the water supply sewage disposal and waste management on the 
skinny island chain 
are you going to allow unrestricted housing and development 
the county it seems to me is beginning to say no theres a 
greater sensitivity now among the people making the decisions that 
they want to preserve whats there 
but county commissioner john stormont often the minority of one 
on development votes charges that under growth management we 
have not managed growth 
the keys historically has never been able to take care of 
itself he says it adopted strong regulations and then ignored 
them 
even with the landuse plan in place the value of new 
construction was up 59 percent for the nine months ending in june 
compared to the same period last year stormont says 
if they had never said were going to have all this 
management you would have gone 15 years without seeing the spurt 
of development weve had in the last two years says ms 
brothers who moved from ohio in 1946 
county planning director donald craig acknowledges that key 
largo has seen a spate of commercial and hotel development big 
pine key has developed rapidly and big coppitt key is becoming a 
bedroom community for key west 
ed swift a county commissioner when the landuse plan was 
adopted in september 1986 noted initial planning would have 
allowed 70000 new housing units in the county of 74500 people 
but the plan reduced that to 16000 units by the year 2020 that 
means the population could grow by roughly 60 percent 
its a very emotional issue says swift a native of st 
louis who has become a leading key west businessman 
consider these recent events 
a federal jury ruled in july that a key west developer 
illegally filled 27 acres of wetlands to build town houses in a 
major test of corps of engineers authority 
the county wants to pave a dirt road parallel to us 1 on big 
pine key the refuge for key deer to improve local access between 
residential areas and the business district but the state objects 
port bougainville once envisioned as the largest resort 
between miami and key west went into bankruptcy and the state has 
pledged to spend 23 million on the north key largo site property

forty years ago you could do anything you pleased anywhere 
says key largo attorney jim mattson one of four defense attorneys 
in the federal dredge trial the state of florida didnt even 
have any regulatory role until the early 70s this was a nation 
unto itself down here 
mattson a transplant from washington dc estimates that he 
has 15 to 20 clients with 20 million worth of property challenging 
landuse restrictions as illegal condemnations 
one thorny issue is the contiguous lot rule which bars a person 
who owns two adjacent residential parcels from building on both 
one house is the limit for the two parcels 
were looking at a lot of lawsuits for christmas presents for 
monroe county mattson says 
meanwhile the county is fighting state efforts to supervise 
growth control 
tom pelham director of the state department of community 
affairs which administers the landuse plan is a favorite target 
the only difference between tom pelham and nero is nero had a 
fiddle says retiring county attorney lucien proby a 
mississippian who bought his first keys property in 1970 mr 
pelham has for some reason taken it upon himself to assume that his 
position as director of the dca has given him imperial rights over 
monroe county 
pelham dismisses the statecounty battles as mostly political 
saberrattling 
everyone has to recognize that the keys have very natural 
limitations on the amount of development that can be 
accommodated he says there is only one keys its something 
that should be protected and preserved and the state has deemed it 
a resource of state significance 
but county commissioners in august authorized attorney david 
paul horan to file suit challenging what the county contends is the 
states administrative veto authority over landuse changes 
this plan completely and arbitrarily rezoned the entire 
county and many people suffered because of it says county mayor 
gene lytton who was elected to the county commission after the 
landuse plan was passed he now votes with the majority as part of 
what environmentalists call the concrete coalition 
monroe county likes to consider itself beyond tallahassees 
control says former county commissioner alison fahrer who was 
defeated in her reelection bid when lytton was elected two years 
ago i think this place can become kind of a scary place for the 
people who like to live like outlaws and pollute their water 
gilbert voss a university of miami biological oceanographer and 
an expert on the keys reefs has written a survey for the friends 
of the everglades 
wherever reefs occur the reefs are deteriorating voss 
concludes in the survey the worst thing that can happen to a 
virgin coral reef today is to tell about it in a tour magazine or 
diving periodical 
cullen chambers a former state park ranger and now director of 
key wests lighthouse museum voices a common concern 
people were attracted to key west because it is a bit of the 
caribbean with the protection of the united states he says we 
virtually destroy the very thing that brought people here to begin 
with its almost a cliche but its true 
charles lee senior vice president of the florida audubon 
society says he has absolutely no faith in monroe county 
government 
they are determined to make it as easy as they can to let 
developers do pretty much whatever they want he says theres 
always going to have to be a state presence to make sure the 
resources are not frittered away 
ed kloski a contractor on the county planning commission still 
sees trouble ahead 
we havent grown up enough he says one of the county 
planners told me were going to take monroe county kicking and 
screaming into the 20th century the problem is were coming from

editors note women have been eating dirt down through the 
centuries in most major cultural groups plato was the first to

onece johnson tried hard to kick the 
habit she took up smoking she began eating laundry starch as a 
substitute but the old craving still lingered 
johnson has to have a daily fix of dirt particularly her 
favorite crunchy clay 
the 38yearold woman is one of a dwindling number of clay 
eaters in america perpetuating an african custom brought to this 
country by black slaves 
ive tried to wean myself away from it says johnson 
showing a visitor the site of the besttasting dirt in her native 
holmes county on the edge of the mississippi delta on a daily 
average id say id eat a tablespoonful just enough to get a 
taste in my mouth like pinching tobacco 
an authority on dirteating is dr dennis frate a medical 
anthropologist and program director of the university of 
mississippis rural health research program in nearby goodman 
its analogous to eating potato chips frate says a snack 
food is what it is 
johnson a staff member at the states shelter workshop for the 
handicapped in lexington says dirt tastes likewell dirt 
it really doesnt have a significant taste she says you 
know when it rains how the earth smells it tastes to me similar to 
what it smells like 
frate conducted a study in 1971 that found that one out of four 
adult women in holmes county ate dirt regularly he said 
dirteating has been reported throughout the south though he knows 
of no recent studies 
for unknown reasons frate says few men eat dirt in america 
while both men and women eat dirt pellets sold today in the markets 
of west africa 
although there is a slight risk of ingesting parasites or 
impacting the colon with large amounts of clay frate says the 
practice generally isnt harmful to the eaters health 
frate conducted a followup study of dirt eaters four years ago 
which was published by the new york academy of sciences the study 
showed that most holmes county dirt eaters had switched to 
potentially harmful substitutes such as laundry starch or baking 
soda which have a texture similar to the dirt 
he says the substitutes are particulary threatening because they 
contribute to high blood pressure 
johnson says doctors told her that women particularly when 
pregnant craved the dirt because of a nutritional deficiency but 
she never believed that because she eats a balanced diet and 
continued wanting dirt long after her babies were born 
after studying blood samples of both dirt eaters and noneaters 
frate concluded that the nutritional status of the two groups 
didnt differ statistically the study refuted the longheld belief 
that malnutrition contributed to the practice an idea frate said 
was first advanced in a new orleans medical journal in the 1850s by 
a doctor studying the health of slaves 
cravings well sure frate says im an italianamerican 
and i get cravings for pasta at least twice a month ive got to 
have my pasta its the same thing theres not a physiological 
urge that tells me i need this i just like how it tastes 
but frate says dirteating is probably going out of vogue even 
in the rural south 
i think when this generation of women those 45 and older 
is gone its going to be unheard of 
but johnson notes there is visible evidence that dirt eaters are 
far from extinct she points to a scoopedout hillside along 
mississippi highway 17 about two miles southeast of lexington its 
one of two sites she knows of where local people continue to get 
dirt to eat 
not just any dirt will do it has to be the right kind of 
crunchy clay frate says the mostpopular eating dirt is a 
lightbrown clay known scientifically as redyellow podzolic 
soil 
johnson says she knows of a few people who mail shoe boxes full 
of local dirt to relatives who cant find suitable sites up 
north 
frate attributes the craving for dirt simply to early childhood 
eating habits johnson agrees she says her children dont eat dirt 
because they grew up in urban jackson 
its a universal practice frate says if you look at the 
ethnographic the anthropological literature every major cultural 
group has at one time in their history been documented as consumers 
of soils frate says plato was the first one to mention it in 
writing greek women consuming soil 
but frate said he doesnt expect the practice to survive for too 
many years even in africa 
im sure as third world nations become more technological 
theyll change like this area did literally leave the soil 
behind he says

editors note what happened in the american west a century ago 
is happening today to the indians of brazils amazon basin it is 
called ethnocide by some a fight for survival by others 
ironically the fate of the indians may be tied to the fate of the 
environment as well 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
to symbolize his mourning the young 
indian wearing a suit smeared a dark paste over his face and 
walked up to the microphone facing hundreds of brazilian 
congressmen he didnt say a word 
that was last year when brazils lawmakers met to write a new 
constitution the countrys eighth 
now recalling the moment ailton krenak 33 explains i 
wanted to call attention to the lack of respect for the rights and 
how government policy has killed us 
krenak coordinator of the indian nations of brazil which 
represents 100 tribes adds its a race against time because 
soon there wont be any indians left 
anthropologists and indian rights groups say the government is 
committing ethnocide because violence disease and land 
invasion by mineral and agricultural interests are wiping out the 
tribes and their cultures and with them the mighty amazon forest 
the indians want their land preserved they also want protection 
from diseases that are foreign to them 
the new constitution inaugurated in october does guarantee 
brazils 250000 native indians the exclusive rights to their 
land and its resources which previously belonged to the federal 
government 
brazil with the western worlds eighth largest economy still 
grapples with its indian question 100 years after the united states 
and other nations resolved theirs mostly by violence 
when brazil was discovered in 1500 by portuguese explorers 5 
million indians occupied the region today only 5 percent of that 
number survive they make up 518 groups with 50 different languages 
and 170 dialects in addition about 3000 to 5000 indians some 
40 groups still live isolated in the amazon rain forest and have 
had no contact with civilization 
contact often is fatal some indians are killed in violent 
encounters with outsiders but most die because they have no 
immunities against common diseases transmitted by whites such as 
malaria tuberculosis influenza or even the common cold 
in the first half of this century alone 87 indian groups 
disappeared largely because of viruses experts estimate that 45 
percent of a given indian population dies within two years of the 
first contact with outsiders 
in brazil everyone agrees indians cant remain isolated 
forever but ethical ideological and practical questions arise as 
to the best way to incorporate them into society 
continuing isolation is impossible but brusque and violent 
encounters with modern brazil kill them says julio gaiger a 
lawyer with the indigenous missionary council an activist group 
linked to brazils dominant roman catholic church 
gaiger and indian protection groups believe that if indians are 
given correct information they can decide for themselves how and to 
what extent they want to join the larger society they argue that 
indians can retain their culture if their lands are protected and 
if they have selfdetermination 
in all indian tribal lands take up 8 percent of brazil a 
nation larger than the continental united states and most indians 
live in the amazon rain forest where minerals lumber and gold 
abound 
but the government recognizes less than half the tribes habitat 
as indian reserves studies conducted by the national museum and 
federal university of rio de janeiro show 70 percent of land 
specifically marked off as belonging to indians has been invaded by 
mineral companies 
despite brazils potential its economic woes are enormous it 
has the largest foreign debt in the third world 600 percent yearly 
inflation 12 million landless rural families an estimated 10 
million street children and stark poverty reflected by 70 million 
of its 144 million people earning just 65 a month 
in its haste to grow economically and realize its ancient dream 
to populate the amazon and protect its borders with nine south 
american nations brazils policy is to integrate indians into 
civilization 
it is our moral duty to give indians the same privileges that 
the overall population has says deputy foreign minister paulo 
tarso flecha de lima it is our responsibility to bring them into 
society we cant leave them in their primitive state 
anthropologists charge that at the rate brazil is clearing away 
and burning off its amazon forest for development thousands of 
indians will die and those who survive will become thirdrate 
citizens 
they get the worst jobs lead miserable lives and become 
alcoholics or prostitutes says anthropologist and indian 
activist ezequias paulo heringer 
bruce albert a french anthropologist who has worked in brazil 
for more than a decade says ideally outside contact should be 
avoided altogether but when it cant be avoided a strong health 
scheme should be mounted and indians should be vaccinated

critics say the governments record with indians has worsened 
under the administration of president jose sarney who assumed 
power in 1985 as the first civilian leader after 21 years of 
military rule 
there is not one nation in latin america which treats its 
indians better than we do counters romero juca filho a 
33yearold economist who presides over the national indian 
foundation the governments indian agency known by its portuguese 
initials as funai 
founded in 1910 as the indian protection service it changed to 
funai in 1967 after allegations that federal agents deliberately 
infected indians with measles smallpox and influenza in 
dismantling the original agency the attorney general charged it 
was a den of corruption and indiscriminate killings 
early this year juca was convicted in one amazon state and is 
under investigation in three others for signing illegal contracts 
with about 50 lumber companies last september and allowing them to 
cut wood in indian reserves he faces only a fine to be set later 
juca did not respond when asked about the investigation he said 
that under his administration we have recuperated the image of 
funai 
it wasnt that the agency had a policy to kill it was 
carelessness and ignorance he says 
juca claims that under him 74 million acres were demarcated for 
indian reservations more than double the 30 million acres 
reserved from 1910 to 1985 
but critics say funai is counting land that merely has been 
identified as having indians on it or was already in the process of 
being demarcated when juca took over 
hes just lying but even when funai demarcates land the 
indians dont know anything about it says osvaldo da cunha a 
former funai physician who coordinated the agencys health programs 
for 10 years basically its a way to reserve an area so it can 
later be commercially developed by whoever pays the most i quit 
last year in utter frustration anger and anguish 
reports of violent clashes between isolated indians and farmers 
and miners are common when word surfaced last year that itinerant 
gold miners shot to death five yanomami indians it created an 
international furor 
the yanomamis are the largest primitive tribe in existence 
numbering about 10000 in the remote northern territory of roraima 
which borders venezuela 
backed by the military funai sent helicopters to remove the 
gold miners and in the process yanked out a group of doctors 
anthropologists and missionaries who were working with the 
yanomamis 
the commission to create the yanomami park as the group is 
called has not been allowed back in the area but some 60000 gold 
explorers remain and the government hasnt taken any action to 
throw them out 
the government charged that the commission funded by 
international organizations such as the denmarkbased international 
work group for indigenous affairs was a front for a foreign plot 
to create another nation even roraimas bishop aldo mongiano was 
ejected and accused of panning for gold to send to his native italy 
a reporter who asked repeatedly to visit the region was told by 
funai it was unsafe 
its unbelievable we had a good health program and the 
yanomamis were slowly becoming aware of the reality around them 
said the groups coordinator carlos zacquini now the indians 
are living in a concentration camp and theyre dying of malaria 
tuberculosis but we cant do anything because only funai and the 
military are allowed in 
last month juca said funai demarcated 5 million acres for the 
yanomamis by naming the zone a national forest in reality the 
yanomamis habitat was reduced by 75 percent the tribes four main 
groups were divided into 19 and under the national forest category 
their land can be commercially exploited 
in september juca was named as the new governor of roraima and 
that has some anthropologists worried 
well that will take care of the yanomamis said 
anthropologist alcida ramos a professor at the university of 
brasilia whom funai denied permission to reenter the region to 
continue work started 10 years ago 
for now indians look to the new constitution as their hope for 
retaining their cultures 
the charter includes some of the most generous indian laws in 
brazils history 
its very nice on paper but the question is how or if the 
law will be applied and by whom krenak says we have a lot of 
work ahead because up to now the government lacked interest

editors note they are the clown cops of cincinnati ohio a 
dynamic duo that tries to defuse domestic disturbances with a bit 
of humor an idea that came from a psychologist in upstate new 
york like a poet once said laughter is their shield most of the 
time it works they say but not always 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when they got the call to investigate a domestic disturbance 
the two cops in cincinnati ohio went into their act 
they pulled down their hats to make their ears protrude 
loosened their ties buttoned their shirts askew and rapped on the 
door playfully with a shave and a haircut beat 
is that your car down there with the lights on the officers 
deadpanned as an angry man opened the door 
the man seeing the oddball cops forgot he was angry and broke 
into a smile 
its a trick the cincinnati police department learned from a 
psychologist in troy ny 
police arriving at the scene of a domestic dispute for 
instance should try performing a bugs bunny impression or try 
raiding the refrigerator before unholstering their nightsticks 
says robert a baron chairman of the psychology department at 
rensselaer polytechnic institute in troy welltimed clowning 
often deters violence more effectively than the threat of force 
cincinnati police officials concede that they were skeptical 
when they first heard baron explain his idea on a local talk show 
but since they began trying it in 1983 theyre finding it works 
our bottomline goal is to resolve conflict with the least 
amount of force says michael gardner a cincinatti police 
officer who teaches the humor technique to new recruits just 
having the police show up doesnt necessarily get attention 
baron was teaching at purdue university in lafayette ind in 
the early 1970s when he first came up with the idea of using humor 
to defuse potentially violent situations 
the basic idea of the research centered on incompatible 
responses he says if someone is angry you do something that 
will make them feel good youll reduce their anger and the things 
that follow it like aggression 
the basic rule of thumb is that when people are experiencing 
strong emotions their logical thinking decreases the research 
tries to counter this we try to pull people toward a calmer 
state 
gardner says barons ideas work best in domestic disputes 
the more emotionally upset someone is the more effective it 
is he says in a family fight a person can be so locked into 
whats going on they can have blinders on 
baron explains that once you get people off the track their 
anger decreases but he concedes that this technique may defuse a 
volatile situation only temporarily 
the idea is to get in quickly and stop the process he says 
its done early in the process when anger is just beginning 
its not powerful late in the process then you might want to 
withdraw 
gardner was the first officer in cincinnati to try clowning but 
he soon persuaded his partner to join him he says they developed 
several acts 
wed often knock with a shave and a haircut beat to it 
says gardner a 15year veteran of the force 
once inside if the parties insisted on fighting gardner and 
his partner would start rearranging the furniture in the room 
saying they needed space to loosen up for the fight 
gardner says he was once caught off guard by his partner who 
gave a firstrate performance and stopped a violent family 
fight 
he threw his hat down during a domestic dispute and said he 
didnt have to take this anymore gardner says eventually this 
guy we had been telling to leave told my partner its no big 
deal ill go take a walk 
gardner says teaching the technique to new recruits at the 
police academy is not always an easy job because they have 
preconceived ideas of what a police officer is and have a rough 
em up attitude he says 
on the other hand he says experienced officers think its 
the best training theyve ever had 
gardner took a leave of absence a year ago to travel around the 
country sharing what he knew with other police departments 
he says he knows of no other police departments using the 
technique but many are becoming interested

editors note as a reward for spending a year tutoring younger 
pupils in the east harlem tutorial program a group of high school 
students was given an opportunity to interview celebrities sports 
stars and successful business people its all part of a volunteer 
program that has survived for 30 years with little governmental 
assistance 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the high school students asked the lawyer if she 
had to punch a time clock they wanted to know how the editor of 
sassy magazine felt about being in such a job at age 25 
they asked mel blount the pittsburgh steelers cornerback when 
they won four super bowls when he knew he was going to become a 
professional football player 
the students are part of the east harlem tutorial program 
celebrating its 30th anniversary this year they were in an 
enrichment program in which they conducted their own interviews 
after hearing reporters from the new york times the wall street 
journal and the associated press talk about the basics of 
interviewing 
twenty students took part in the program they were all 
encouraged to choose the person they most wanted to interview rock 
stars famous athletes including mike tyson all ranked high on 
their lists but there were some surprises one student asked to 
interview the curator of the museum of natural history 
this was their reward for a year of tutoring younger students as 
part of the tutorial internship program tip students they also 
got a 110aweek stipend 
the lawyer told the students that punching a time clock was not 
part of lawyering 
the editor of sassy explained how she studied hard worked hard 
and it was okay to be that young 
blount now director of player relations for the national 
football league stressed the importance of getting a good 
education and pointed out how few football players make it to the 
nfl 
but perhaps the star of the show was the anonymous assistant of 
a top fashion photographer douglas doubler 
the students had come to interview doubler but the assistant 
was assigned to show them around first they asked him how he got 
his job 
he reported that he took a job sweeping the floors to get a 
toehold into the glitzy world of high fashion photography he 
worked hard was noticed and soon he was being asked to do other 
things now hes doublers assistant 
the east harlem tutorial project ehtp is an unusual 
momandpop operation that began in an east harlem living room and 
gets little governmental aid it provides oneonone help to 
students most at risk of dropping out volunteers range from these 
neighborhood high school students to wall street yuppies prep 
school students retirees and grandmothers 
susan ingalls a member of the ehtp staff says these minority 
tutors are often the first black role models the youngsters have 
ever had 
the youngster may have an older brother or sister the same age 
as the tutor but the older sibling doesnt sit down and help with 
homework or show that he or she cares about them ingalls says 
but the volunteers from the prep schools who are mostly white 
are important to the program too she says 
often what happens especially with the prep school students 
is that they get very involved with one child and remain in the 
program for years working with that one student thats probably 
when it works best says julia c schieffelin a former president 
of the organizations board of directors 
julie bailey who became a volunteer after her daughter became a 
tutor while in prep school says the students usually went in 
groups of three or four to the interviews 
in a couple of cases they were struck dumb but they recovered 
enough to go on with the interviews she says for some it was 
their first experience in looking at the work world in hearing 
what it was like to deal with supervisors and authority 
these were milliondollar interviews for these kids and we ran 
the whole program on 750 
glenn hopkins director of project discovery at columbia 
university says the east harlem project is unusual in that its 
not very bureaucratic its warm inviting accessible and you can 
get involved in a very personal way 
you can get in there with a minimum of formality and touch a 
kid help a kid 
ehtp has a 375000 budget this year of which only 15000 
comes from the government so it has not been affected by federal 
cutbacks 
it puts on a fundraiser each year featuring manhattans 
literati calvin and alice trilling hes a writer for the new 
yorker recruit many of the celebrities such as maya angelou 
george plimpton and eli wallach

richard mulligan whose characters are often 
on the threshold of madness is the straight man in his new nbc 
comedy series empty nest 
he plays a pediatrician whose wife has recently died and left 
him with three grown daughters at least two of whom are neurotic 
a nurse whose heart is still in appalachia and a nextdoorneighbor 
who is a freeloader and free with advice 
mulligan is the perfectly normal one okay so he talks to his 
dog but who doesnt 
this is the richard mulligan who brought inspired lunacy to burt 
campbell on soap went to pieces in the movie sob made 
col george a custer a case study in abnormal psychology in 
little big man and in teachers was the looney who walked 
into the school and started teaching 
hes certainly different from my role on soap mulligan 
says noting that producerwriter susan harris created both series 
this guys a good doctor who cares deeply about his patients 
hes a good fellow trying to take care of his daughters his wife 
died 18 months ago and he still cant take the ring off 
even as a straight man reacting to the craziness going on 
around him mulligan cant help being funny his long expressive 
face slapped together out of silly putty has a direct line to the 
funny bone his talks to dreyfuss a lovable monstrous mixture of 
golden retriever and saint bernard come off as dialogues the 
clownfaced dreyfuss like a canine version of mulligan reacts 
with almost human emotions 
the show a spinoff from golden girls also stars dinah 
manoff and kristy mcnichol as his daughters park overall as his 
nurse david leisure as his neighbor and a dog named bear as 
dreyfuss the third daughter is away at college but calls 
frequently for help 
bear is very sweet and very smart says mulligan theres 
a lot of kidding on the set because he gets a little reward after 
every scene now all the actors are demanding rewards bear even 
has a double his brother julio 
the idea for empty nest first appeared a few years ago as an 
episode of golden girls paul dooley and rita moreno starred as 
husband and wife 
it was originally about a father and mother whose children 
have left the nest says mulligan they look at each other and 
say what now then susan came up with the idea of the widower 
that gave it more dimensions somehow it became bittersweet yet 
funny 
although the new show is a spinoff from golden girls there 
are no immediate plans for any crossover mulligans character 
lives in the same miami neighborhood so its expected that at some 
time in the future one of the ladies will pay a visit perhaps 
blanche will make a play for the doctor or the pediatrician may 
treat sophia and give her a lollipop 
mulligan grew up in the bronx with ambitions of becoming a 
playwright his brother robert is a director to kill a 
mockingbird he studied playwriting at columbia university but 
was soon turned toward acting 
empty nest is his fifth series in his first the hero 
in 196667 he was a movie western star who was afraid of horses 
and was anything but a hero offscreen next came a small role as a 
mystery writer in diana which starred diana rigg in 197374 
soap ran four years and made him a star but his next series 
reggie in 1983 was a quick flop 
mulligan these days is usually seen as a comic performer 
although he did do a straight dramatic role in the nbc miniseries 
gore vidals lincoln 
there was a time in the theater in new york nobody would give 
me a comedy role he says id play in oneill or tennessee 
williams once i was in charlies an old theater bar and i 
couldnt convince anyone i could do comedy 
then i heard gene sax was going to do nobody loves an 
albatross and i auditioned for the role as the ghostwriter i got 
it and i was good so good in fact i had trouble getting 
dramatic parts

kate nelligan has made a career on broadway of 
playing strong independent women 
in plenty she was the disillusioned wife of a british 
diplomat witnessing englands decline after world war ii in eugene 
oneills a moon for the misbegotten she was a hearty and 
plainspoken irish farm girl bewitching the playwrights 
whiskeysoaked alter ego in serious money she was a voracious 
american arbitrageur wheeling and dealing on the worlds financial 
markets 
now she has returned to new york in what could be her best stage 
role yet the vibrant volatile redhaired heroine of michael 
wellers 1950s family drama spoils of war 
she portrays elise a leftwing muchmarried extravagant woman 
whose one true passion is her teenage son martin the play 
described by weller as semiautobiographical centers on 
martins attempt to bring his mother and his longabsent father 
back together nelligans costars include jeffrey demunn as the 
husband and christopher collet as her adored son 
for the actress spoils of war represents nearly a yearlong 
journey to broadway nelligan has lived with the character and the 
play since last january when the director austin pendleton 
suggested her for the role of elise 
the play was presented to me then as an unfinished piece of 
work says the canadianborn actress the first act was pretty 
much in shape and the second act wasnt there was a beginning and 
an end but i didnt say what are you going to do with it i 
said i want to do it 
about two weeks before rehearsals started nelligan sat down for 
a threehour meeting with weller to talk not about the play but 
about the woman in it they discussed who she was as well as 
things the playwright knew about elise from his own life 
it was the first time in her 16 years as a professional actress 
that nelligan was there during the creation 
ive worked on new plays with writers but ive never worked 
on a play that came such a long way the actress says michael 
was finding the play as we went along 
the character of elise started out as an auntie mame she was 
just a real goodtime girl in the first performance she appeared 
as a ghost to a character who is no longer even in the play the 
adult martin who is on the point of divorcing his wife 
weller rewrote the play several times before the drama opened in 
may at the tiny offbroadway second stage the theater company was 
devoting its entire season to the playwright and spoils of war 
was the finale in a year that also saw productions of wellers 
moonchildren and loose ends 
the rewriting continued during the plays second stage 
engagement often with the actors rehearsing one version during the 
day and performing a different one at night 
it was an awful period nelligan admits particularly until 
the actors discovered the people they were playing all they could 
do was trust the playwright she recalls 
i thought michael was moving toward something but it was just 
very painful to be performing something when i didnt know what i 
was doing a lot of time nelligan says ive always been sure 
of my lines and now i wasnt sure what would come out of my mouth 
because the lines were always being changed 
there were other changes after the offbroadway run ended and 
the company prepared for its november opening at new yorks music 
box theater 
there was a break from the end of june until the middle of 
august while weller worked on a new ending 
there are a couple of new actors a new set and more 
rewrites nelligan says 
one thing nelligan didnt discuss with weller was what he was 
going to do with the play 
id never ask him that the actress says i think thats 
the way he likes to work its his play it isnt mine 
nelligan insists the role was not tailormade for her 
michael was writing from memory she says but its been 
useful to see all the places he has gone to with the play because 
that informs what you end up with even all the rejected 
possibilities that he explored they might be taken out but they 
are in your memory to use for whats left 
it was nelligans idea to let her character sport long red hair 
and she willingly donned a wig to make elise more flamboyant and 
fun 
the character has got quite a range bigger than anybody i 
ever played nelligan says she can have a lot of fun and gives 
people a lot of fun and then shes also in a lot of pain and a lot 
of trouble shes a human fleshandblood creature 
although born in canada nelligan didnt make her professional 
canadian debut until spoils of war opened in toronto in 
september before coming to new york 
most of her career has been centered in england and the united 
states despite her schooling at londons central school of speech 
and drama her best training she says has been has been watching 
other performers particularly at the national theater and the 
royal shakespeare company 
the greatest teacher i ever had was an actor named colin 
blakeley who died last year nelligan says i did george 
bernard shaws heartbreak house with him when i was 24 years old 
and i learned a lot 
nothing she had done prepared her for the intense exhilarating 
work of spoils of war particularly in its early days 
the process had been so overheated what with all the rewrites 
the short short rehearsal time and that tiny theater at second 
stage and no money nelligan says getting it on stage and 
having it survive all those things was hard 
i was so tired she remembers then after a few weeks it 
got to be something i could do and go away from

bird 
 
how well can one ever know a genius can we ever really open the 
many doors to their lives and capture their scattered energies 
clint eastwood attempts to harness the creative genius and 
tortured man who was charlie parker in his movie bird a 
bittersweet portrait of the great jazzman who died at the age of 34 
in 1955 
his journey begins on the dusty dirt roads outside kansas city 
when parker was a hornblowing child and moves with the tempo of 
bebop to the hot clubs of new york where a young trumpet player 
named dizzy gillespie was all the rage 
with thelonious monk and bud powell on piano kenny clarke on 
drums and later a young miles davis on trumpet parker and 
gillespie helped define and create a new musical venture in jazz 
bebop 
bird parkers nickname was yardbird and shortened to the 
bird harvests all the creative juices of that age the 
spontaneity the excitement at the same time it pokes into the 
underbelly of the jazz world drugs alcohol debauchery 
and parker was no stranger to that lost world 
forest whitaker good morning vietnam platoon is 
gentle yet fierce playful yet obsessed in his role as parker for 
which he was awarded the best actor prize at the cannes film 
festival it was well deserved for a stunning performance that even 
captures the hunched body stances assumed by the musician as he 
performed 
as chan parker diane venora ironweed fx finds the 
right balance between free spirit and strong loving wife who 
battles her husbands philandering and personal demons and at the 
same time champions his work and wellbeing 
their relationship and music are the only constants in parkers 
existence we see him slip deeper into despair as drugs and alcohol 
destroy him eventually the death of his daughter pushes him into 
the abyss his grief and perhaps a glimmer of the parker enigma are 
shown when he tries to contact chan after learning on the road 
about the tragedy 
he sends an endless stream of telegrams to chan the first 
signed your husband charlie parker this formality in a way 
mirrors his inability to completely surrender himself in an 
intimate relationship 
still we never really know charlie parker 
eastwood is spare in his direction allowing his actors to reach 
deeper into themselves he has filmed the malpaso production for 
warner bros in muted tones and shadows clearly he intended the 
somber moods of black and white and probably should have shot 
bird in that pristine way because the movie suffers from being 
too dark sometimes obscuring whats on the screen 
lenny niehaus did the score which isolates parkers original 
playing of laura april in paris ornithology 
parkers mood and other jazz tunes and remixes his recorded 
solos with contemporary musicians including bassist ron carter 
trumpeter john faddis pianists walter davis jr and barry harris 
jazz purists wont like the scoring others will find the 
soundtrack outstanding

mystic pizza 
 
what kind of a movie is mystic pizza a farout rock 
musical a horror story about a mankilling pizza it is neither 
rather it concerns the romantic misadventures of three waitresses 
in a pizza parlor in the town of mystic conn 
dont be put off by the ambiguoussounding title and the lack of 
star names mystic pizza is a marvelously warm and funny 
comedydrama that is frankly sentimental but never cloying it is 
far more satisfying than the bigbudget offerings with boxoffice 
names 
the film begins with a nervous bride jojo lili taylor 
walking down the church aisle amid the approving glances of family 
and friends midway through the ceremony she passes out cold end 
of wedding 
jojos problem is that she adores the body of fisherman bill 
vincent odonofrio but she resists commitment her friend kat 
annabeth gish might be willing to commit but boys are put off by 
her intellect shes going to study astronomy on a yale university 
scholarship boys are no problem for her beautiful sister daisy 
julia roberts she has ado annies problem the inability to say 
no 
daisy becomes enmeshed with a spoiled rich kid adam storke 
and her sister falls for a married architect william r moses 
with robert redford looks and a daughter who needs babysitting 
most of the film concerns the unraveling of the three romances but 
there are colorful scenes in the pizza joint presided over by the 
mountainous conchata ferrell 
what makes mystic pizza so enjoyable is the wittily 
vernacular script by amy jones randy and perry howze and alfred 
uhry it is one of the few occasions when multiple authors appear 
to have enhanced a screenplay 
the direction by donald petrie is right on the mark crisp 
funny intensely human 
the performances are a delightful surprise roberts is a 
gorgeous brunette with fire in her eyes taylor has a sharp comedic 
style and gish evokes the most sympathy of the trio moses 
falcon crest is silkily seductive as the architect and 
storke and donofrio are excellent 
the seaside town of mystic also plays a major role and it is 
beautifully photographed by tim suhrstedt 
mystic pizza is rated r for language and sex scenes a

take what you need atlantic robin trower 
 
robin trowers latest take what you need is for anyone who 
carries a torch for 1970sstyle hard rock and needs a dose of that 
mix of heavy guitar husky vocals and gutkicking drums 
record company hype says the new album showcases trowers 
maturity as a gasp songwriter dont believe it for a minute 
trowers guitar playing is the main attraction here 
and on that level it works take what you need comes alive 
when trower steps to the forefront and starts picking otherwise 
the album seldom rises above the ordinary 
trowers new fourman band opens with tear it up a bouncy 
tune with runofthemill looking out for no 1 lyrics im 
gonna tear it up tonight this is my time im gonna tear it up 
tonight take whats mine 
next up is a ballad take what you need from me which 
features dreamy liquid guitar work from trower this is trower 
doing what he does best 
the last two songs on side 1 however show why they dont make 
records like this anymore the title of love attack tells you 
all you need to know its unimaginative music with a dumb macho 
front and i want you home has even less to offer 
theres another nice ballad over you on side 2 as well as 
the funky careless which has a guitar line reminiscent of jimi 
hendrix machine gun and the genuinely catchy love wont 
wait forever 
from the time he left procol harum to launch a solo career in 
1973 trower has been unfairly criticized as a little league 
hendrix its a bum rap 
he obviously was influenced by hendrix as well as other leading 
rock n roll guitarists of the era but although he has never 
attained the heights of a hendrix trower continues to be a fine 
guitarist whose licks stay with you 
whether his type of music still has an audience is debatable 
its dinosaur rock to be sure but pretty good dinosaur rock

dream of life arista patti smith 
 
dream of life ends a nineyear artistic hiatus for 
poetsinger patti smith whose 1975 album horses was one of the 
best debuts in rock history and redefined the role of women in pop 
music 
the only thing redefined on dream of life is smith she is 
now happily married and the mother of two young children domestic 
tranquility appears to have robbed her formerly ferocious music of 
the bite that made a lasting impression 
still dream of life a positive and spiritual record is 
occasionally moving and smith in great voice throughout is 
generous with catchy melodies she shows she has been listening to 
the radio during the past nine years cooing like cyndi lauper on 
the pensive going under and borrowing from the bangles on the 
hookfilled looking for you 
smith whose work in the 1970s represented some of the most 
successful mergers of poetry to rock arrangements occasionally 
gets tangled up in her wordy lyrics they suck all the energy from 
where duty calls a narrative on the marine deaths in lebanaon 
that is an embarrassing mess 
the best moments come at the end of side 1 with the thumping 
up there down there and the beautiful ballad paths that 
cross both treatises on the afterlife 
those who seek feel the glow a glow we all will know smith 
sings on the latter its easy to forget that on horses smith 
opened with the words jesus died for somebodys sins but not 
mine 
one lesson dream of life provides is that 13 years and two 
kids will change a persons perspective

redoowopp rca the tokens 
 
the tokens hold an honored place in pop music because of their 
1960s hit the lion sleeps tonight 
wimoweh wimoweh remember 
you can forgive a lot for a song like that but the tokens have 
gone beyond endurance in redoowopp it is amazing that a disc 
could include little star hushabye little darlin 
do you wanna dance and la bamba just in the first six 
minutes and yet be such a meadow muffin 
the problem is this idea of redo or as the liner notes 
explain to mix doowop with todays recording technology to 
satisfy generations of music lovers 
like were awfully embarrassed by these old songs but if we 
put a really thudding stupid electrowhizbang beat underneath then 
you might like see the eternal timelessness of it all its the 
same nitwit logic that sends old rock stars out in illfitting 
toupes prancing around like paunches had sex appeal 
its sad because the tokens are a tight group that does more 
than justice to the harmonies which are doowops heart and soul 
doowop is music of street corners subway tunnels and sock hops 
not great music maybe but deserving of a little respect on its 
own terms

back in hollywood after a 20month absence 
michael caine wanted to correct the belief that he is the busiest 
actor in movies 
gene hackman has four pictures coming out he declared 
and now we have another candidate 
i was having dinner with ben kingsley the other night hes 
got five coming out ive only got two as well as the television 
movie about jack the ripper then i have no other projects im 
truly out of work in case any producers are listening im 
available 
caine was back in los angeles to help launch without a clue 
in which he plays a sherlock holmes impersonator to kingsleys dr 
watson it was a surprisingly sentimental visit for caine who 
returned to his native england after being a beverly hills resident 
for nine years 
i was very happy here i had everything a person could want 
including artistic and financial success he recalled 
but then one day i started to get homesick for the english 
countryside you know homesickness can almost become a terminal 
disease i became very unhappy 
so i moved back to england and this is my first trip back to 
los angeles and now were going to buy a little holiday place 
just to come and visit when i went to england i thought well 
ill obviously miss the weather in la and ill miss the 
efficiency and the service industries which are wonderful 
what i never figured on was the many friends i made here and 
the actual depth of friendship when we came back this time it was 
amazing how pleased we were to see everybody and how pleased 
everybody was to see us my wife said weve just got to have a 
place here where we can come and hang out we used to go to the 
south of france now well come here 
when without a clue was first suggested to caine he 
dismissed the idea of portraying sherlock holmes 
i could handle the uppercrust accent he said but i 
figured how could i play the role any better than basil rathbone 
he was the archetypal sherlock holmes 
i always saw holmes as having a noble aquiline face i have 
the face of a welllivedin peasant i always enjoyed the stories 
of sherlock holmes but i knew no one would ever ask me to play 
him 
to caines delight he found the script cast him as a dissolute 
womanizing actor who is enlisted to portray holmes by watson 
this holmes is more like inspector clouseau the actor 
explained referring to the character immortalized by the late 
peter sellers in the pink panther movie 
last summer caine filmed another comedy dirty rotten 
scoundrels with steve martin 
ive been trying to do comedy for a long time said caine 
i did a small role for alan alda in sweet liberty figuring 
that would break me in when woody allen asked me to do hannah and 
her sisters i figured i had it made 
but during my scenes woody was always saying not so funny 
michael he wanted me to be serious well i guess he knew what he 
was doing because it won me the academy award he laughed 
appreciatively 
despite awards and million dollar salaries michael caine 55 
has never forgotten his cockney beginnings as son of a fishmarket 
porter and a scrubwoman his formal education ended at the age of 
15 and he drifted into acting after serving tea in a london 
theater unlike most english actors he did not attend any drama 
academies 
i am formally untrained as an actor he remarked and 
never in prestigious theaters like the royal shakespeare company or 
the national theater im more of a journeyman kind of actor doing 
what i can where i can 
but the results are the same you wind up in movies with 
playing the truth if youre not truthful youre not entertaining 
in a serious thing and if youre not truthful you wont get any 
laughs in comedy 
caine spent 11 years in london theater and television finally 
reaching the west end the equivalent of broadway two weeks later 
he was offered the role of an effete british officer in the film 
zulu soon afterward alfie brought him an academy award 
nomination and a nonstop career he has never returned to the 
theater 
i was basically a movie actor in my mind he said i think 
that was because i came from the working class 
whenever i read biographies of english actors like john 
gielgud or ralph richardson or larry olivier they start out i 
fell in love with the theater when my nanny took me to my first 
play i knew what i wanted to be i never went to the theater 
until i was 21 22 
i went to the cinema and i grew up in the cinema thats why 
i have such an affinity with america being working class i 
identified with the american cinema because they had working class 
heroes in those days our cinema was usually taken from 
drawingroom comedies played by drawingroom actors with whom i had 
nothing in common in my life i always saw things in common with 
america

not every event in a book fits together 
perfectly and the worlds sharply different political and social 
systems hardly do either 
so why should buildings be different 
a developing school of architecture is demonstrating that 
architecture can be as varied and even chaotic as life itself 
buildings can veer off at sharp angles soar up or down take 
surprising turns and appear to hang in space or they can look like 
something that just collapsed 
photographs and plans of buildings that show the latest trends 
in a movement called deconstructivist architecture recently 
appeared in a small exhibition at the museum of modern art in new 
york the creations were by seven architects who work separately 
and in different countries but in their very originality the 
designers have something in common 
the idea of a balanced harmonious world is a little bit of a 
myth contemporary society is far more complex than that 
said one participant swissborn bernard tschumi dean of the 
school of architecture at columbia university in new york 
some of the work in the show is trying to capture part of that 
aspect 
a stroll around the exhibit showed a variety of buildings whose 
creators seem to have totally sworn off of symmetry and tradition 
there was a proposed housing complex for west berlin by daniel 
libeskind of milan italy it looked well as the catalog said 
a colossal bar angled up from the ground so that one end floats 
10 stories high looking over the berlin wallan array of oblique 
supports holds up the floating arm 
iraqiborn zaha m hadid who now works in london showed a 
design for a proposed nightclub for hong kong the building is 
formed by a series of platforms that appear to be flying off in 
different directions from a hillside 
a proposed skyscraper by the austrian architectural group coop 
himmelblau consisted of a series of independent vertical volumes 
some of which included bold curves and sharp angles connected by a 
series of oblique passageways and substructures 
there also was a design of the center for the visual arts at 
ohio state university designed by new york architect peter 
eisenman the center has already been constructed the design 
showed a 516footlong cage of steel columns and beams rising on an 
incline to a height of five stories breaking its way through two 
existing buildings 
the califorina aerospace museum in los angeles which also has 
already been constructed was designed by american frank gehry the 
twisted facade walls look as if the building is going through the 
strain of a liftoff 
at first glance deconstructivism may seem to be merely a 
question of throwing the rule book away and improvising the more 
angular and radical the design the better but the movement in 
fact has a logic of its own and carries some heavy philosophical 
and historical baggage 
ever since the late 1970s some architects have been trying to 
push the limits of architecture and discover how far they could 
go tschumi said 
so far he said britain has been most sensitive to the 
movement much deconstructivist work stems from the architecture 
association in london with which most of the people in the show 
were associated in the late 70s and early 80s 
some people look farther back for deconstructivisms roots 
architectcritic joseph giovannini cites the influence not only 
of the art movement called russian constructivism that existed 
roughly from 191030 but also of a french literary and 
philosophical movement known as deconstructionism 
french deconstructionist jacques derrida he said believed that 
just as a literary text can never achieve a truly unifying 
wholeness a building too can consist of disparate unaligned 
parts 
many of the deconstructivist projects giovannini added in an 
interview with their images of dislocation the physical forms 
raise metaphysical questions 
he wrote in a recent article for the new york times magazine 
that the deconstructivist movement mirrors an unruly world 
subject to caroming moral political and economic systems 
buildings however still need to stand up even if they are the 
product of flights of metaphysical imagination tschumi noted that 
a large part of the work at the exhibition deals with new finds 
in structures and is the product of very advanced computer 
engineering he said they are part of a serious body of work 
buildings also need to be useable by their occupants however 
pleasurable they may be to their architects

medicine sunday believes in simplicity with a 
beat 
no horns no synthesizers no voice lessons for their lead 
singer 
medicine sunday wants nothing to get in the way of their music 
or their audience ask anyone who has seen them play 
some people will sit there and listen and really understand 
and there are people who get into the energy of the band and they 
start dancing and jumping around bassist matt barton said if 
the crowds jumping around we start jumping around ill jump off 
the stage 
it feeds off each other 
i dont feel seperated from the audience on stage added 
vocalist frank pupo anything that happens happens 
along with barton and pupo are guitarist oliver wolf and 
drummer steve reisman pupo and wolf formed the band two years ago 
we kind of clicked and started rehearsing pupo said 
things started going good and we decided to get a bass player 
the bass player barton came from a diverse musical background 
i played in pop rock bands and jazz bands barton said i 
used to play gospel music in high school 
medicine sundays sound has been compared to u2 and joy 
division pupo whose singing recalls jim morrison and the late ian 
curtis of joy division says the band tries to keep its sound as 
simple as possible 
when you have overproduction you lose a lot youre 
committed to sounding just like the record otherwise people are 
disappointed pupo said all the bands ive ever liked have the 
same basic formula 
pupo began performing live when he was 18 
people put their fingers in their ears i was kicked out of a 
couple of bands but pupo kept singing and eventually caught on 
i found someone who liked the way i sang said pupo adding 
that he learned how important breathing correctly was for a 
vocalist i sing from my throat a lot i like the sound i get 
pupo has been writing poems from an early age and is the groups 
main lyricist 
i started out in california they had different ideas about 
how things should be done the lyrics they wanted are a lot more 
literal im in love with a girl i dont write like that 
pupo says he tries to let the audience derive its own meanings 
from his songs 
i try not to force meanings on people when you read a book 
you get an interpretation of a character its stream of 
consciousness 
simplicity again is an important part of pupos writing i 
try to get as much meaning to as many words as i can like japanese 
haikus 
medicine sunday has signed with urg records and the first album 
is expected to be released this fall the bands most popular song 
in concert has been conviction inspired by one of pupos poems 
its got that light tone we try to communicate with the music 
and the words pupo said youre riding along and you go up a 
little bit and you go down a little bit 
conviction was structured around bartons bass line 
i put the bass line together when i was falling asleep in 
bed he said i tried to calm myself down and started playing 
these chords its a very hypnotic song kind of like a battle 
hymn 
medicine sunday produced its own album with the emphasis not 
surprisingly on simplicity 
what kills underground bands is they get in they make a great 
album and they get overproduced pupo said if everything is 
overproduced you cant feel the emotion of the music 
the bands songs such as dirty little world and big 
machine are hardedged no good days lives up to the 
bleakness of its title 
you just have a lousy week and you wake up and its going to 
happen all over again you see no light at the end of the tunnel 
pupo said 
medicine sunday may share the harsh view of the world as 
envisioned by punks but they have no use for the hope i die 
before i get old mentality of so many groups 
were not concerned about being young forever pupo said 
i dont even think well put pictures on the album 
the bands goals like their sound are simple medicine sunday 
is not looking to make a million dollars it just wants to remain a 
part of the fans lives 
when i read a book and it really affects me the guy has done 
his job pupo said kafka did what he set out to do i dont 
necessarily have to meet him to be affected by him

a former high school science teacher is 
growing microbes that could revolutionize mining by neutralizing 
the acid drainage that costs companies and the government millions 
for cleanup 
jo davison has convinced peabody coal co the nations largest 
producer to let her bugs eat the poisonous runoff from a west 
virginia mine 
well give it a try said jim crawford manager of 
environmental affairs at peabodys west virginia headquarters here 
if it works great if it doesnt well 
acid drainage oozes its telltale red water anywhere mine 
operators cut into earth and stone containing pyrites the global 
problem plagues miners of not only coal but also of gold silver 
and other natural resources it starts with the breaking of the 
soil and lasts long after the mine has been shut down 
anywhere there are pyrites there is acidic drainage said 
west virginia university researcher jeff skousen pyrites are metal 
sulfides that in the presence of air and water produce sulfuric 
acid 
anywhere there is acid drainage miners face expensive chemical 
treatments to remove heavy metals and neutralize the water and the 
chemicals used to treat the drainage themselves often are toxic 
coal industry officials have pegged the water treatment costs at 
1 million a day in the united states west virginia has paid more 
than 1 million in three years to treat abandoned sites in just two 
counties 
metals from mine drainage poison 20 percent of west virginias 
streams and 13 percent are too acid from the drainage or too 
alkaline from overzealous treatment according to a state report 
last month 
enter davison a gravelvoiced woman with a stubborn certainty 
there must be a natural solution to the manmade problem 
her work parallels wetlands research at west virginia 
university where she was completing a masters degree in science 
education in the 1950s 
after a dam holding mine runoff broke and flooded a pristine bog 
in german valley west virginia university researcher joe lange 
discovered that water leaving the bog was crystal clear 
mine reclamation researchers then urged building wetlands with 
acidtolerant cattails and sphagnum mosses to somehow trap and 
negate the heavy metals that leach from mines scientists dont 
understand fully how wetlands work but they do work and the 
industry slowly is adopting the process 
more than 100 artificial wetlands were created at mine sites in 
southwestern pennsylvania last year skousen said more and more 
people are finding wetlands can reduce contaminants were not sure 
how long these will continue what happens when they dry up thats 
one of the big questions 
the plants themselves absorb only a minute amount of the heavy 
metals indications are that most of the action is at the 
microscopic level once the heavy metals are removed acidity is 
easily lowered with a wash of limestone 
davison who four years ago quit her teaching job to open lambda 
environmental technologies inc in columbus ohio has been on the 
microbe trail since the bog discovery for years she and high 
school teacher barbara harris gathered and experimented with every 
kind of wetland microbe they could get their hands on digging in 
muck from florida to canada 
in the end davison bred microbes that attack specific metals 
one oxidizes iron others do the same to aluminum sulfur or 
manganese they chelate or bond with the metals so they can 
oxidize and drop out of the water 
then comes the real kicker the redeposited iron resembles the 
pyrites laid down millions of years ago when the coal seams were 
created were creating a situation for forming coal skousen 
said 
microbes have other potentials in removing sulfur from coal 
that otherwise would be discarded in treatment of polluted water 
in mining uranium and gold and in pesticide usage 
davisons process is called an immobilized microbial pollution 
purification system and she says only she has it 
the microbiologist and her nine employees isolate and hybridize 
the bugs in a basement laboratory in columbus grow them in vats in 
dayton ohio and from an office in morgantown plot their release 
into special mine drainage ponds 
patents are pending on the microbes their mixes and the 
growing mediums that allow the organisms to live in acid water in 
the first place 
i developed the bugs i found which microbes do what i know 
which bugs work and what their proper balance is she said 
but they say if its that simple then why in the hell didnt 
penn state discover it 
texas aampm university has selected davison to join a 189 million 
project to build a demonstration treatment pond at a lignite strip 
mine site there 
but the industry itself has been slow to take the bait 
state energy department spokesman roger hall said davisons 
results have been amazing in the laboratory but less impressive in 
the field 
they havent reached the point where theyve totally 
eliminated the problem hall said they need to do some work on 
it 
he cited the use of the microbe system on an acidic mine 
drainage problem in garrett county md davisons microbes have 
remarkably reduced iron levels in the water but not consistently 
brought them within regulatory levels 
davison says that with more time the levels will be in 
compliance everyone has laughed at the wetlands and laughed at 
our microbes they say you can never get that many bugs together to 
treat so much runoff but it works we can engineer any site in 
order to handle the drainage 
at peabody coals robinhood mine in boone county for instance 
davisons company will treat 50 to 100 gallons a minute of acid 
runoff with a solid bed of microbeseeded dirt beneath a pond of 
microbeseeded water 
federal office of surface mining agronomist eric perry in 
pittsburgh said coal operators might be more willing to give the 
process a try if they knew how it worked he said the industry is 
very conservative especially about something that appears to be a 
black box with bugs inside it 
davison is keeping her bugs in the box by design exactly what 
they are and what they do will not be published until she has a 
patent 
lambda has successfully treated acid drainage at a handful of 
sites in ohio west virginia and maryland but peabodys applied 
technology program is its first major industrial contract 
for peabody she has cooked up a balanced ecosystem of 77 
bacteria 56 algae groups seven fungi and 15 protozoa a generic 
mix would be cheaper but at this point davison cannot afford less 
than brilliant results 
peabody coal spends about 50000 a year treating the mine now 
crawford said neither he nor davison would say how much the 
microbe treatment will cost but if it works he said the savings 
will be substantial 
theres no doubt about it it would sure reduce our overall 
costs

a group isnt just the sum of its parts 
says a researcher who was driven by his own experiences to study 
why bright people sometimes founder when they put their heads 
together 
robert j sternberg a professor of pyschology and education 
found that the success or failure of a group effort is determined 
in large part by the blend of the members attributes and skills 
when business government or other organizations form committees 
or problemsolving groups too much attention is given to who the 
individuals are and instead of how they work together sternberg 
said 
the key question that should be asked he said is will these 
people be smart as a group 
there are bright people who are not good in groups because 
they lack social skills you could be bright but obnoxious and then 
people are going to try to show you a thing or two and not 
listen he said one bore in a group can destroy the group one 
jerk can really through a meeting off 
in a study of 96 volunteers aged 14 to 70 working alone and in 
threes sternberg and a graduate student found the effectiveness of 
any group can be predicted by knowing the iq of its smartest member 
maximum iq made more of a difference than average iq according 
to the study which will be published in the december issue of the 
journal intelligence 
in every group you want to have one very smart person said 
sternberg 
but there can be too much of a good thing if one group member 
is too much smarter than his or her fellow problemsolvers the iq 
predictor is no longer valid 
if the other persons are too mediocre they may not recognize 
or accept what the brightest member has to say sternberg said a 
vastly smarter person may also hinder group success by appearing 
threatening to other members 
an even better predictor of group success or failure is maximum 
creativity said sternberg 
the yale researchers measured creativity by having two raters 
evaluate the performance of study participants as recorded on 
videotapes of group sessions 
the groups were asked to develop a marketing plan for an 
imaginary new sugar substitute or to solve an economic problem that 
threatened a communitys rural lifestyle 
the researchers also looked at how social skills affect a 
groups success they found an effective group will have a 
highaverage social competence in areas of persuasiveness 
expressiveness and assertiveness 
social skills were measured by a combination of written tests 
such as the eysenck personality questionnaire and evaluations of 
the videotaped meetings 
in the area of social skills as opposed to intelligence its 
more important to have parity 
with social skills it doesnt work as well to have one person 
incredibly socially skilled the problem is if you have others who 
arent they interfere with that persons ability to facilitate the 
group process sternberg said 
as with intelligence when it comes to social competence there 
can be too much of a good thing the reseachers called this 
potential problem the eager beaver phenomenon which they said 
happens often enough to have a powerful effect statistically 
if you have one person who is too much of an eager beaver it 
hurts the group product the eager beaver tries to take over the 
group but generally isnt the best person they carry more weight 
than they deserve sternberg said 
after having been presented with a task study participants were 
allowed to work alone twice alone first and then in a group in a 
group first and then alone or both times in a group 
the results demonstrated the value of diversity said sternberg 
group products were superior to the efforts of those working alone 
with the best results achieved by those who worked in a group twice 
the results not only demonstrate the importance of diversity 
they also point to a shortcoming in the educational system 
sternberg said in terms of education almost all the training 
children receive is individual doing homework is individual 
everything is supposed to be individual 
but when you are an adult almost everything you do is as a 
group or you need group approval so i think we need to pay more 
attention to teaching people how to work in a group

a husband and wife who study brown 
bears from a tree stand in the alaska wilderness believe the huge 
carnivores are among a small group of intelligent animals that are 
playful all their lives 
brown bears or grizzlies play games with each other and appear 
captivated by tree limbs stumps stones and tall grass their 
hijinks dont stop as they grow from cubs into adults says bob 
fagen an animal behavior specialist and associate professor of 
biometry at the university of alaska 
it looks like the brown bears of pack creek may be one of the 
rare species that play the same amount through all of their 
lives fagen said 
that puts them in the company of chimpanzees lions wolves and 
several domestic animals those fagen calls a small select group 
of intelligent social cultural species 
the bears stand out because they dont have a very cooperative 
relationship like wolves 
brown bears are reputed loners at pack creek they chase each 
other snap and trade growls sometimes the growling turns into 
fighting 
fagen has spent four summers at pack creek 30 miles south of 
juneau on admiralty island to observe about 30 bears that gather 
to catch spawning salmon his wife johanna a biologist has spent 
three summers 
in july and august the fagens live in a tent on an island off 
the creek mouth with their 8yearold son kevin and a rotation of 
graduate students who help keep track of the bears they monitor 
bears 12 to 15 hours a day from the tree stand a tarpcovered 
platform about 15 feet above ground 
in addition to their studies of play the fagens monitor all the 
bears movements and interactions with people 
the records help wildlife officials determine how bears are 
affected by the crowds of people who show up every summer to 
photograph them bears disturbed by clicking shutters overflying 
aircraft or other activity show changes in their behavior 
the most sensitive indicator we know is play fagen said 
play tends to be inhibited by any kind of stressful or strange 
experience 
though one researcher at pack creek thought the bears play was 
inhibited when people were around the fagens say they have not 
found the same result 
mrs fagen has watched cubs playing chasing games and she saw 
an older bear lie on its back and roll a huge rotted stump atop 
its upended paws they are very oriented to objects they like to 
push and pull stones they playfight with a clump of grass or an 
overhanging branch 
the fagens saw an adult male and female sliding down a patch of 
snow apparently in fun during the mating season 
mrs fagen also suspects that bears indulge in pleasures humans 
might not recognize as such rolling in dead fish for instance 
she said the bears seem to appreciate smell being attracted to 
fish and gasoline and fond of rolling in a sawdust pile 
the fagens hope their study of play will add to broader research 
into how bear behavior is molded 
we want to look at the little ways and big ways that behavior 
is passed between generations other than genetically fagen said 
the fagens know that cubs tend to use their mothers fishing 
territory even after they leave her side at 2 to 3 years of age by 
tracking play and foraging patterns they hope to find out if cubs 
also adopt their mothers fishing techniques and personality traits 
the studies at pack creek were pioneered in 1981 by ken post of 
the us forest service after five more years here we will be 
observing the daughters of the first bears observed fagen said 
this research too may help wildlife managers the fagens hope 
to find out if problem bears those that are aggressive to 
humans learn the behavior from their mothers if so managers may 
be able to better predict bears behavior and avoid confrontations 
between them and people

a former high school science teacher is 
growing microbes that could revolutionize mining by neutralizing 
the acid drainage that costs companies and the government millions 
for cleanup 
jo davison has convinced peabody coal co the nations largest 
producer to let her bugs eat the poisonous runoff from a west 
virginia mine 
acid drainage oozes its telltale red water anywhere mine 
operators cut into earth and stone containing pyrites the global 
problem plagues miners of not only coal but also of gold silver 
and other natural resources it starts with the breaking of the 
soil and lasts long after the mine has been shut down 
anywhere there are pyrites there is acidic drainage said 
west virginia university researcher jeff skousen pyrites are metal 
sulfides that in the presence of air and water produce sulfuric 
acid 
anywhere there is acid drainage miners face expensive chemical 
treatments to remove heavy metals and neutralize the water coal 
industry officials have pegged water treatment costs at 1 million 
a day in the united states 
davisons work parallels wetlands research at west virginia 
university when a dam holding runoff broke and flooded a pristine 
bog in german valley researcher joe lange discovered that water 
leaving the bog was clear 
mine reclamation researchers urged building wetlands with 
acidtolerant cattails and sphagnum mosses to somehow trap and 
negate the heavy metals that leach from mines scientists dont 
understand fully how wetlands work but they do work and the 
industry slowly is adopting the process 
the plants themselves absorb only a minute amount of the heavy 
metals indications are that most of the action is at the 
microscopic level 
davison has bred microbes that attack specific metals one 
oxidizes iron others do the same to aluminum sulfur or manganese 
they chelate or bond with the metals so they can oxidize and drop 
out of the water 
patents are pending on the microbes their mixes and the 
growing mediums that allow the organisms to live in acid water in 
the first place 
the industry itself has been slow to take the bait state energy 
department spokesman roger hall said davisons results have been 
amazing in the laboratory but less impressive in the field

a group isnt just the sum of its parts 
says a researcher who was driven by his own experiences to study 
why bright people sometimes founder when they put their heads 
together 
robert j sternberg a professor of pyschology and education 
found that the success or failure of a group effort is determined 
in large part by the blend of the members attributes and skills 
when business government or other organizations form committees 
or problemsolving groups too much attention is given to who the 
individuals are and instead of how they work together sternberg 
said 
the question is will these people be smart as a group 
in a study of 96 volunteers ranging in age from 14 to 70 
working alone and in threes sternberg and a graduate student found 
that the effectiveness of any group can be predicted by the iq of 
its smartest member maximum iq made more a difference than average 
iq according to the study which will be published in december in 
the journal intelligence 
but there can be too much of a good thing if the other 
persons are too mediocre they may not recognize or accept what 
the brightest member has to say sternberg said a vastly smarter 
person may also hinder group success by appearing threatening to 
other members 
the researchers also found that an effective group will have a 
highaverage social competence in areas of persuasiveness 
expressiveness and assertiveness

for the first time the american lung 
association is urging a yearly flu shot for anybody who lives with 
elderly people or others at high risk for influenza 
previously the association recommended the vaccine only for 
people who themselves were at high risk 
we must draw a ring of immunity around our senior citizens and 
others who are most vulnerable because 80 percent of them are not 
getting vaccinated each year frederick ruben of the lung 
associations medical section the american thoracic society said 
in a statement 
flu and pneumonia kill about 68000 people a year in the united 
states more than any other infectious disease the lung 
association says 
people at high risk for potentially fatal complications of 
influenza include those 65 or older residents of nursing homes or 
other longterm care facilities and adults and children older than 
six months who have chronic heart or lung disease diabetes kidney 
ailments anemia infection with the aids virus or suppressed 
immune systems the lung association said 
the category also includes children older than six months and 
teenagers up to 18 years who are receiving longterm aspirin 
therapy because of the risk of developing a potentially fatal 
disorder called reyes syndrome after flu infection the 
association said 
flu shots are also recommended for home care providers such as 
visiting nurses or volunteer workers who are in daily contact with 
highrisk people the association said

one in five marathon runners in a recent study 
showed evidence of internal bleeding after completing a race and 
runners who cover shorter distances might also be susceptible to 
bleeding say two doctors from the walter reed army medical center 
in washington dc 
such bleeding detected by testing for blood in urine and stool 
samples before and after runners competed can lead to anemia and 
can also hide more serious problems such as stomach and colon 
cancer the doctors said 
speaking at a meeting in new york of the american college of 
gastroenterology the doctors advised any runners who detect signs 
of bleeding such as black stools or urine to seek medical help 
older runners who face a greater risk of colon or stomach 
cancer should be tested to see whether the bleeding is the result 
of running or is an early warning sign of cancer the doctors said 
runners seem to accept this as a matter of course said dr 
david peura chief of gastroenterology at walter reed they dont 
seem to be too concerned about these things that is a mistake 
he said 
peura said that up to 80 percent of ultramarathoners those who 
run 100mile races begin to discharge blood in stool or urine 
following their races 
puera and dr frank moses also a gastroenterologist said they 
took blood samples from 120 runners before and after a recent 
marine corps marathon none were bleeding in the digestive tract 
before the race but about 20 percent had blood in their stools 
after the race puera said 
moses has also studied the abdominal cramping and diarrhea that 
many runners complain of and found that running causes the passage 
of food to slow through the small intestine but that it might 
increase its speed through the colon leading to diarrhea that 
remains to be studied he said

the implantation of heatconducting metallic 
seeds into brain tumors should enable doctors to warm the 
tumors sensitizing them to anticancer drugs and radiation 
treatments a researcher says 
surgery is usually unable to remove brain tumors completely and 
the brain can tolerate only a certain level of anticancer drugs 
and radiation by heating the tumor doctors hope they can increase 
the likelihood that drugs and radiation will wipe it out said dr 
sean grady of the university of washington school of medicine in 
seattle 
grady said that initial animal tests had shown that tiny seeds 
of a neodyniumironboron alloy could be inserted under the skull 
and maneuvered with external magnets into brain tumors 
preliminary studies reported in chicago at the annual meeting 
of the american college of surgeons this week showed that the 
seeds would not damage normal brain tissue as they were 
maneuvered into position grady said 
tumors occur in many different shapes so it was important to 
find out if the seeds could be moved easily in different 
directions grady said the studies suggest that you could move 
the seeds into and back out of each limb or extension of the 
tumor he said 
the next experiments are intended to determine whether the seeds 
can be heated to desired temperatures he said 
he said he doubted that the new method would replace 
chemotherapy or radiation but we might find that the seeds will 
become another modality for the treatment of malignant brain 
tumors

grand metropolitan plc shareholders today 
overwhelmingly approved the british companys 523 billion 
takeover bid for pillsbury co 
at a special meeting the shareholders also voted in favor of 
grand metropolitans plan to sell off its intercontinental chain 
of 100 hotels to the saison group of japan for 215 billion and to 
sell new grand metropolitan shares to existing shareholders to 
raise funds toward the pillsbury offer 
the minneapolisbased pillsbury which controls the burger king 
restaurant chain and whose products include green giant vegetables 
and haagen dazs ice cream rejected grand mets offer of 60 a 
share in cash last tuesday saying it was considering ways of 
remaining independent 
johnny thompson pillsburys vice president for public 
relations said monday morning he could not immediately comment on 
the grand met shareholders action he said a reporters telephone 
call was the first notification he had of the action 
grand met launched the surprise offer oct 4 just five days 
after announcing the intercontinental sale the company said these 
moves were part of its strategy to focus on foods liquor and 
retailing and to expand its interests in the united states and 
japan 
grand mets brands include jampb scotch whisky and gilbeys gin 
grand met chairman allen sheppard said at the special 
shareholders meeting we dont think we will fail at this 
takeover because we feel it is a full and fair value offer 
in rejecting the grand met offer pillsbury said it was 
considering several options including a onetime special dividend 
a sales of some of the companys businesses a leveraged buyout and 
the sale of an interest in the pillsbury to a third party 
in a leveraged buyout investors borrow heavily to buy out a

a fight over kraft inc began today as the 
food maker turned down a 11 billion takeover bid from philip 
morris cos and said it would undertake a 1359 billion 
recapitalization plan 
the kraft proposal would be the largest corporate restructuring 
ever would force kraft to sell off some lines and would boost the 
companys debt more than tenfold 
we should take action to maximize shareholder value rather 
than accept an inadequate offer said kraft chairman and chief 
executive john m richman in a statement released late sunday we 
strongly believe the 90 takeover bid by philip morris 
undervalues kraft 
richman said the recapitalization plan would have a 
significantly higher value for shareholders by boosting the value 
of the companys stock to 110 per share 
philip morris spokesman tom ricke reached by telephone in new 
york late sunday said he could not immediately comment on the move 
by kraft 
but it was expected the tobacco and food products company which 
has an excess of cash on hand would answer kraft with a higher bid 
philip morris indicated last week it was ready for a fight 
filing a lawsuit in us district court in chicago challenging 
krafts poison pill antitakeover defense the pill makes a 
hostile takeover prohibitively expensive 
the kraft recapitalization would include a distribution in cash 
and securities of about 98 per share and retention of common stock 
interest richman said the market would determine the value of 
kraft stock after the distribution he said 
kraft stock closed at 92 a share in new york stock exchange 
composite trading on friday 
philip morris offered a week ago to buy kraft for 90 a share in 
cash for each of krafts nearly 1236 million shares outstanding 
or a total of about 11 billion 
the kraft recapitalization plan at 110 a share values the 
company at about 1359 billion 
that kraft stock rose above the 90 offer is a clear signal 
that investors see the philip morris bid as low richman said 
richman said the recapitalization plan would be presented to the 
companys board of directors soon and then would be submitted to 
stockholders at a special meeting 
he said the plan would involve selling some kraft businesses 
but that core brands representing about 80 percent of the companys 
profits would be kept 
the plan also involves bank borrowings of more than 68 billion 
and the public sale of some 3 billion of debt kraft has already 
begun negotiations on some of the transactions and goldman sachs 
and co has said it is confident it can place the debt kraft said 
while richman said the company would proceed with the 
recapitalization he left open the possibility that the board could 
accept another bid 
if someone comes forward with a transaction that would be more 
desirable than the restructuring plan we will negotiate and your 
board will give full consideration to such a transaction richman 
said 
the new york times reported last week the leveraged buyout 
specialist kohlberg kravis roberts amp co might be offering its 
services to kraft management 
sources quoted by the times said kohlberg kravis was financially 
capable of competing against philip morris however today kohlberg 
kravis took on an even bigger deal announcing it would begin a 
tender offer of more than 20 billion for rjr nabisco inc 
a combination of kraft and philip morris would create the 
worlds largest maker of consumer goods and would decrease philip 
morris heavy dependence on profitable but stagnating cigarette 
sales 
philip morris best known for marlboro virginia slims benson amp 
hedges and merit cigarettes took over general foods corp the 
maker of jello maxwell house koolaid shake n bake and oscar 
mayer in 1985 for 57 billion 
the addition of kraft would bring such names as velveeta 
thousand island dressings cheez whiz breyers light n lively 
sealtest and frusen gladje to the philip morris lineup

the stampede of bids for food companies 
intensified today as the investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp 
co announced it would begin a 2028 billion tender offer for rjr 
nabisco inc 
the kohlberg kravis announcement came four days after managers 
of the food and tobacco products company said they were considering 
taking the manufacturer private for nearly 17 billion 
management has decided that the company should be sold our 
offer is a better one henry kravis a partner in the new 
yorkbased leveraged buyout specialist firm said in a statement 
the kohlberg kravis offer was for 90 a share in cash and 
securities compared with the management buyout proposal of 75 a 
share in cash 
there was no immediate comment from rjr nabisco 
however investors reacted enthusiastically to news of the 
kohlberg kravis bid rjr nabisco stock shot up 1037 a share to 
8712 in early new york stock exchange trading today 
kohlberg kravis had been expected to enter the whirlwind of bids 
for food companies that began oct 4 with a 523 billion bid for 
pillsbury co by grand metropolitan plc a british company 
kravis said his company had raised an equity pool of 56 
billion for leveraged buyouts in a leveraged buyout investors 
borrow heavily to purchase a company and then pay off the debt with 
the target companys cash flow or the sale of its assets 
securities analysts said last week the plan by rjr nabisco 
management was a preemptive strike to protect the company that 
manufactures many wellknown brand names including winston and 
camel cigarettes and oreo cookies from an unwanted suitor 
rjr nabisco president f ross johnson and other executives made 
their announcement after philip morris cos inc offered more than 
11 billion for kraft inc the processed foods manufacturer 
kohlberg kravis had been thought to be considering a bid for 
kraft which late sunday rejected the philip morris bid and 
announced a 1359 billion recapitalization plan 
kohlberg kravis carried out the largest leveraged buyout in us 
history in 1986 when it took the food and consumer products 
conglomerate beatrice cos private for 61 billion 
the investment firm is also leading a group that is attempting 
to acquire the publishing giant macmillan inc for 25 billion 
british publisher robert maxwell who also seeks to buy macmillan 
is fighting that bid in a delaware court 
kohlberg kravis recently withdrew a 503 billion bid for the 
supermarket operator kroger co after kroger rejected the offer and 
said it would proceed with a financial restructuring 
in its statement today kohlberg kravis said its offer for rjr 
nabisco was conditioned upon approval of rjr nabiscos board the 
investment firm said it would begin its tender offer later this 
week but did not specify exactly when it would begin

farley inc parent of the fruit of the loom 
underwear company today launched a tender offer for west 
pointpepperell inc that values the textile giant at about 14 
billion 
farley one of the nations largest privately owned 
conglomerates is offering 48 a share in cash for each of 
pepperells 294 million outstanding shares 
in early trading on the new york stock exchange pepperell 
jumped 425 a share to 4950 
william farley who heads the chicagobased concern said in a 
letter to pepperell chairman and chief executive officer joseph l 
lanier jr that he hoped to move forward on a constructive 
friendly basis 
the offer was not entirely unexpected in may farley sought 
government permission to acquire up to 25 percent of pepperells 
stock so far he has spent 88 million for a 98 percent stake in 
the west point gabased company 
pepperell spokesman donald downs said the company would have no 
comment until it had studied the offer farley said had telephoned 
him months ago and indicated he preferred to remain independent 
farley said his company already has taken legal action to 
challenge georgias antitakeover statutes as well as pepperells 
poison pill last june pepperell strengthened its poison pill 
designed to make unwanted takeovers prohibitively expensive 
the lawsuits would be dropped however if pepperell agrees to 
work with farley on a friendly basis farley said in a statement 
pepperell which manufacturs brand name products includiung 
arrow shirts and martex towels acquired textile rival jp stevens 
amp co earlier this year for 12 billion and then split up stevens 
assets with a rival suitor pepperell was left with most of 
stevens linen and towel operations giving the company about 25 
percent of the nations home fashion textile market 
farley has a 300 million war chest for acquisitions 
accumulated from a bond issue earlier this year but has indicated 
he wants to keep twothirds of it in reserve for other investments 
he said he would finance the pepperell takeover with a 
combination of bank financing and highyield junk bonds offered

hallmark cards today agreed to replace a line of 
greeting cards that had been challenged in a lawsuit by blue 
mountain arts a tiny colorado card company that had accused 
hallmark of copying its card design 
the consent decree filed in denver us district court ends the 
legal dispute between the two companies that began when blue 
mountain arts of boulder filed a 50 million lawsuit in july 1986 
against hallmark 
the card war had been scheduled to go to trial jan 2 in federal 
court here at issue were a line of cards featuring watercolor art 
and freeverse messages which blue mountain created and hallmark 
allegedly copied 
under terms of the consent decree hallmark will stop publishing 
its personal touch line of cards discontinue use of the personal 
touch name and take steps to repurchase the cards from hallmark 
stores 
blue mountain had alleged that hallmarks personal touch line of 
greeting cards was deceptively similar to blue mountains 
airebrush feelings and watercolor feelings 
the decree also stipulates a monetary settlement but neither 
hallmark nor blue mountain would disclose the amount 
last week hallmark lost a bid in the us supreme court to 
overturn an injunction prohibiting hallmark from distributing the 
83 cards in its personal touch line 
we are absolutely thrilled with this decree said susan 
polis schutz poet and cofounder of blue mountain this is 
important not only for us but for all artists and businesses 
bob gall general manager of blue mountain said that while the 
decree requires hallmark to pay a damage settlement that is not 
the decrees most important aspect 
we feel the emphasis in the case is not money but that 
artists and businesses around the country can feel free to create 
without fear of being copied he said 
hallmark said one of the key points in the agreement with blue 
mountain was that it will introduce a new card line with a new name 
to replace personal touch the company said it agreed not to 
develop products similar in appearance to blue mountains 
the kansas city card manufacturer also said it agreed in the 
settlement not to pressure hallmark outlets to refuse blue mountain 
products for sale and it said the agreement provides that neither 
side admit liability or wrongdoing 
we have found common ground with blue mountain because we are 
interested in promoting fair competition while protecting both 
companies trademarks irv hockaday president and chief 
executive officer of hallmark said 
blue mountain attorney hary melkonian of los angeles said the 
consent decree was a convenient way to resolve the lawsuit 
without the ordeal of a trial since little else could have been 
gained

grain and soybean futures were moderately lower 
in early trading today on the chicago board of trade reflecting 
disappointment over slack export business and improved growing 
conditions in south america 
the soybean market appeared to be leading the grain markets 
lower on reports of fairly heavy weekend showers in brazil and 
forecasts for more rain by midweek in both brazil and argentina 
analysts said 
the generally slow pace of grain export sales continued to exert 
pressure on corn and wheat prices 
an increase in exports is what we need in both markets to get 
things rolling said dale gustafson an analyst with drexel 
burnham lambert inc in chicago 
he said the corn market remained nervous about the effect on 
export demand of aflatoxin a naturallyoccurring cancercausing 
substance that has turned up in some newly harvested corn 
at least one ship had to unload corn bound for overseas after 
federal inspectors found aflatoxin in the shipment and japan is 
weighing restrictions on us corn contaminated by aflatoxin 
in early trading wheat was 1 cents to 4 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in december at 415 a bushel corn was 
cent to 2 cents lower with december at 281 a bushel oats were 
1 cents to 3 cents lower with december at 247 a bushel 
soybeans were cent to 6 cents lower with november at 769 a 
bushel 
cattle futures were mostly higher while pork futures were mostly 
lower in early trading on the chicago mercantile exchange

reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 
per 42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in 
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes 
began compiling figures

grapefruit gourmands relax 
ruby red hasnt disappeared from the market it just has a 
new name texas rubysweet 
so has the muchheralded redder rio red variety which 
first hit the market last year it is now promoted along with its 
older crimson cousin the star ruby under the new name of rio 
star 
the name changes are part of an aggressive new campaign from the 
texas citrus industry bouncing back five years after a rare hard 
freeze that wiped out groves and scared many growers out of the 
grapefruit and orange business 
the new crop is just beginning to hit the market this year 
producers say they finally have enough fruit again to promote 
texas citrus in japan europe and throughout the united states 
so intent is the texas industry on recapturing its lost market 
some growers are shipping almost all the fruit they have out of the 
state much to the dismay of some of the folks back home 
were trying to reach people who really like to eat 
grapefruit said texas citrus promoter mary bentley mckeever 
adding that there is a touch of snob appeal do you want to say 
the connoisseurs 
we are very interested in presenting texas citrus as a very 
premium grapefruit getting it out of the generic category of 
grapefruit ms mckeever said she is marketing manager for 
texasweet citrus advertising inc the mcallenbased promotional 
arm of the texas citrus industry 
by establishing the new categories that we have for our red 
grapefruit thats produced exclusively in texas we really feel 
like we can have some distinction for texas she said 
the states citrus industry is concentrated in its three 
southernmost counties in the rio grande valley rio star will 
represent the two reddest varieties grown there while rubysweet 
will refer to the lighter ruby red henderson ruby and ray ruby 
the texas industry is trying to make up ground given up to its 
florida competition since the 1983 freeze particularly in the 
midwestern market florida produces more than 10 times more 
grapefruit than texas and 100 times the texas orange crop 
but texas contributed 20 percent of the nations total fresh 
grapefruit shipments in the past year because of the states 
emphasis on fresh fruit said leslie whitlock manager of the texas 
valley citrus committee also based in mcallen 
texasweet began its comeback last year with promotions in the 
midwest especially cincinnati where it shipped nearly all of the 
limited quantity of the new rio red variety 
the promotional effort annoyed some texans who found they could 
not buy the new improved fruit with red meat developed in weslaco 
by dr richard hensz of texas aampi university kroger co had 
shipped it all to ohio 
whitlock said the young rio red trees will produce more this 
year but still have not matured enough to make the fruit easy to 
find in local stores 
also contributing to the local shortage are overseas sales of 
the largest most expensive grapefruit 
were selling the largesize fruit in japan said ken 
martin president and general manager of warehouse farms inc the 
rio grande valleys largest citrus packing company in japanese 
gift stores martin said people have been known to pay as much as 
25 for one grapefruit and routinely pay 2 to 250 per fruit 
shipping costs and tariffs make the fruit expensive in japan 
a survey by the florida department of citrus earlier this year 
found that consumers believe white grapefruit is the most tart 
while pink and red are sweeter according to an article in the oct 
8 edition of the packer a national weekly publication of the 
fruit and vegetable industry 
the packer reported the surveys finding that red is 
considered sweetest although it doesnt appear to be widely 
available the researchers found a low awareness of texas 
grapefruit relative to florida and california there is some 
awareness of red grapefruit but only among heavy users 
the texas industrys new campaign features a poster with a stop 
light and a red grapefruit half where the red light should be 
stop and rediscover the sweeter juicier grapefruit from 
texas the poster promoting rubysweet reads 
it has taken texas citrus growers a few years to recover from 
the trauma of the 1983 freeze which reduced a 110 million 
industry to almost nothing the next year of a total of 69200 
acres in production before the freeze only 21800 acres survived 
by the early spring of 1987 when the last official tree count 
was conducted there were 30400 acres including some still too 
young to produce fruit it takes four to eight years for the trees 
to start producing appreciable harvests 
this will be the first year of significant production of young 
trees that were planted since the freeze whitlock said 
seventy percent of the new trees are the rio red variety he 
said 
while volume this year is expected to be less than half the rio 
grande valleys total prefreeze crop the wholesale value of the 
fruit is projected to be worth 83 million to 85 million whitlock 
said 
growers expect to earn 80 percent of what they made from the 
110 million prefreeze crop with less than half the production 
because of their emphasis on fresh fruit 
fresh fruit sells for about twice as much as fruit sold for 
juice 
whitlock said the quality of the fresh fruit has improved 
because growers who are serious about grapefruit and oranges stayed 
in the industry after the freeze while many absentee growers and 
others less dedicated to citrus dropped out

if those trickortreaters who show up 
at your door look you in the eye instead of the kneecap this year 
dont be surprised 
the masquerading and tomfoolery of halloween isnt just for kids 
anymore 
like so many of lifes finer things the holiday has been 
yuppified and has therefore become a big business 
its no longer a childrens holiday the majority of dollars 
are spent on adults said jack sheehan owner of the costumer in 
upstate new york 
according to hallmark cards inc an estimated 300 million will 
be spent in the united states just on costumes for all hallows eve 
1988 which pretty much means the days of drumming up a halloween 
costume in a lastminute dash to the attic or basement are over 
weve discovered that the single most important factor for an 
adult in determining whether he or she has a good time at halloween 
is whether they find the right costume said michael dement a 
spokesman for hallmark in kansas city mo 
sheehan who also rents costumes for theatrical productions 
does about 40 percent of his business for the annual holiday which 
traces its origins to the druids in 700 bc 
fifty million american adults are expected to attend halloween 
parties this year an increase of 25 percent over the last three 
years and 28 million halloween cards will be given in 1988 
hallmark says 
its the secondlargest adult partygiving occasion in the 
united states said dement new years eve is the top adult 
partying occasion 
there are several theories on the increased interest in 
halloween 
one is that people are so busy with work and family and 
community activities that its almost like we have to give 
ourselves permission to have fun halloweens kind of made for 
that dement said 
i would say in general there has been a big increase in the 
last several years in the value people place on fun and enjoyment 
in life said lynn r kahle a psychologist and professor of 
consumer behavior at the university of oregon in eugene fun has 
become a much greater priority for people 
why the surge in halloween buying 
people buy things to represent their values kahle said 
so it makes sense to me that people would be involved in buying 
things that are especially fun 
halloween also provides an opportunity to escape 
the society we live in today is a very fastmoving rapid 
society this is an opportunity to go back to our childhood to 
a time when we think that life was a lot easier it also gives us 
an opportunity to be anything that we want to be for that one 
day said philip morris head of morris costumes inc which 
distributes and manufactures costumes in charlotte nc chicago 
and los angeles 
its controlled scream therapy where once a year you can 
scream and be totally acceptable in doing it added sheehan who 
stocks 35000 costumes 
morris said his company manufactured 60000 freddy krueger masks 
of the gruesome character from nightmare on elm street they 
could have sold twice that number he said 
children and adults alike are wearing more professional 
costumes sheehan said mothers who in years past sewed a costume 
for their children are working today and dont have time to make 
them anymore 
the rise of the young urban professional and discretionary 
income also means people have more cash to spend on themselves 
sheehan believes 
halloween cant compete with other holidays like christmas or 
presidents day when it comes to general sales according to the 
national association of retail merchants granted people dont 
rush out and buy a microwave or clothes for halloween 
but a look in any store after sept 1 is a strong indication 
that halloween has its place in retail sales 
as for halloween candy it doesnt matter whether its for kids 
or adults 
halloween is one of the largest candyselling holidays of the 
year said philip kimball of the national confectioners 
association 
a survey commissioned by the the association found that 93 
percent of households with children under 12 will participate in 
halloween festivities either by trick or treating or giving treats 
away kimball said

mcorp a financial services organization said 
monday it lost 517 million in the third quarter and that its board 
had placed a moratorium on payment of its outstanding debt and 
preferred stock dividends 
the loss reflects a substantial addition to the allowance for 
possible loan losses a large provision for possible losses on 
assets acquired upon foreclosure and other costs associated with 
asset quality pressures the company reported 
the moratorium included payment of principal and interest on all 
parent company publicly and privately placed indebtedness for 
borrowed money 
the moratorium which affects approximately 470 million in 
outstanding debt was effective oct 21 and will remain in place 
indefinitely officials said 
the moratorium permits mcorp to marshal it assets in its 
recapitalization proposal pending before the federal deposit 
insurance corp 
the loss for the quarter ended sept 30 compares with a net loss 
of 737 million for the same period in 1987 
the company had net income of 462 million for the second 
quarter of 1988 including a 215 million gain from sale of its 80 
percent interest in mtech 
as a result of the loss officials said that obligations under 
certain debt covenants prohibit mcorp from declaring dividends 
unless it returns to profitability or obtains waivers from 
bankholders 
the moratorium does not affect the companys mbanks or 
customers said gene h bishop mcorp chairman and chief 
executive officer business will continue as usual 
he said the boards action was designed to conserve maximum 
resources at the parent company so that they can be used in 
connection with the recapitalization of the company and its banking 
subsidiaries 
separately mcorp officials said the board of governors of the 
federal reserve system had issued a temporary order directing the 
company not to declare dividends on its common or preferred shares 
or otherwise engage in any transaction that could result in the 
dissipation of assets of the parent company without the approval of 
the federal reserve 
the decision to suspend payments of dividends and to declare the 
debt moratorium did not result from the federal reserve order 
company officials said and mcorp is in compliance with the order

exxon corp the largest us oil company said 
today its profit rose 15 percent in the third quarter despite a 
slight decline in revenue because of lower crude oil prices 
exxon said it earned 126 billion or 93 cents a share up from 
107 billion or 75 cents a share a year earlier revenue fell 
02 percent to 2189 billion from 2193 billion

billion from 615 billion 
exxon said improved profit margins on its refined products and 
record earnings from chemicals were principal factors in the 
improved profits 
the improved margins on refined products were made possible by 
relatively firm prices for the products combined with lower costs 
for the crude oil that goes into them exxon said margins on 
refining and marketing had been severely depressed a year 
earlier the company said 
however weak crude oil prices depressed earnings from 
exploration and production operations it said

thirdquarter profits rose 15 percent at exxon corp and 24 
percent at atlantic richfield co as lower crude oil prices raised 
profit margins on products made from oil the industry giants said 
monday 
ashland oil inc said its net income was flat in its latest 
fiscal quarter but rose 55 percent excluding the effects of 
unusual items 
the drop in the price of oil lowered the companies profits from 
exploration and production of crude oil 
however the price drop raised their profits from products such 
as gasoline heating oil and petrochemicals by reducing the cost of 
the oil that goes into making them exxon and arco said 
sometimes prices of refined products fall in lockstep with crude 
oil prices but this time they stayed relatively firm creating 
wider profit margins for the oil companies 
oil prices have fallen over the past year mainly because of the 
inability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to 
rein in excess production 
arco said its average price for domestic crude oil fell more 
than 4 a barrel to 962 a barrel in the third quarter from 14 a 
barrel a year earlier 
new yorkbased exxon the largest us oil company said it 
earned 126 billion or 93 cents a share up from 107 billion 
or 75 cents a share a year earlier revenue fell 02 percent to 
2189 billion from 2193 billion 
for the first nine months of its fiscal year exxon said its 
profit rose 18 percent to 388 billion or 289 a share from 
329 billion or 231 a share revenue rose 65 percent to 655 
billion from 615 billion 
improved profit margins on refined products were made possible 
by relatively firm prices for the products combined with lower 
costs for the crude oil that goes into them exxon said margins on 
refining and marketing had been severely depressed a year 
earlier the company said 
however weak crude oil prices depressed earnings from 
exploration and production operations it said 
arco based in los angeles and the eighth largest us oil 
company said its profit rose to 391 million or 217 a share 
from 315 million or 171 a share a year earlier revenue rose 
to 459 billion from 444 billion 
for the ninemonth period arco said its profit rose 348 
percent to 119 billion or 656 a share from 884 million or 
482 a share revenue rose about 11 percent to 138 billion from 
124 billion 
arco said its aftertax earnings from oil and gas exploration 
and production shrank to 80 million from 235 million a year 
earlier but aftertax profits of refining and marketing rose to 
121 million from 30 million a year earlier 
profits at its lyondell petrochemical co jumped to 156 million 
from 23 million arco announced separately that it was considering 
selling 50 percent of lyondell to the public in a stock offering 
ashland the ashland kybased company that is the nations 
14th largest oil company said its profit in its fourth quarter 
ended sept 30 was 66 million or 119 a share compared to 66 
million or 111 a share a year earlier excluding special items 
net income rose 55 percent the company said earnings for the full 
fiscal year were 224 million or 401 a share on revenue of 82 
billion compared with earnings of 133 million or 214 a share 
on revenue of 7 billion in 1987 
but the company said in the release that unusual items affected 
results for all periods including the settlement of lawsuits by 
former employees and cost overruns on fluidized bed boilers built 
by a subsidiary these and other previously announced items reduced 
the fourth quarters earnings by 25 million or 45 cents a share 
and the years results by 28 million or 50 cents a share

grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower 
monday on the chicago board of trade amid disappointment over slack 
export sales and improved growing conditions for south american 
crops 
soybeans corn and oats ended substantially lower but wheat 
finished down only slightly due to a late rebound on news that 
china was seeking 400000 metric tons of us wheat at subsidized 
prices 
and the agriculture departments weekly report on grain 
inspections for export which was released after the close 
indicated greater movement of corn last week than expected 
analysts said 
the usdas report that 537 million bushels of corn were 
inspected last week was really quite favorable said dale 
gustafson an analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc in new york 
it was surprisingly good in light of the light vessel count we 
saw at gulf he said 
soybean prices retreated on reports of fairly heavy weekend 
showers in brazil and forecasts for more rain by midweek in both 
brazil and argentina gustafson said 
at the close wheat was unchanged to 4 cents lower with 
december at 417 a bushel corn was unchanged to 4 cents lower 
with december at 279 a bushel oats were 3 cents to 5 cents 
lower with december at 244 a bushel soybeans were 2 cents to 
10 cents lower with november at 764 a bushel

the flight attendants union at pan am corp has 
filed a complaint with the federal government accusing the airline 
of age discrimination in the recent closing of its san francisco 
base 
the independent union of flight attendants which represents 
some 4300 attendants at pan am said it filed the discrimination 
complaint on oct 13 with the equal employment opportunity 
commission 
pan am hadnt seen the complaint yet and had no immediate 
comment on the action spokeswoman pamela hanlon said monday she 
said it was the first such complaint filed against the airline in 
recent years 
the companys closing of the base on oct 1 was a purposeful 
attempt to phase out older higher paid and more experienced 
flight attendants in favor of younger employees margaret brennan 
president of the pan am local said in a statement 
pan ams trying to bring us back to the day of no wrinkles in 
the aisles ms brennan said more than 100 of the 245 flight 
attendants based in san francisco were over the age of 40 
more than 90 percent of the 245 attendants were earning salaries 
in pan ams higher wage scale ranging up to 40000 a year the 
union said current starting salaries for flight attendants at the 
airline are about 10000 to 12000 annually 
in its charge the union is asking the eeoc for an 
investigation the reopening of the base and damages to be paid to 
flight attendants who retired early were transferred or were laid 
off as a result of the closure 
as of midoctober 19 attendants at the base had accepted early 
retirement and 95 had been laid off the union said it said that 
many other attendants now commuting from san francisco to 
other pan am bases are expected to accept furlough or early 
retirement 
an age discrimination charge may be filed with the eeoc if the 
party involved is over 40 years old and feels that he or she was 
discriminated against because of age the commission has agreed to 
look into the flight attendants charge indicating that it 
believes there may be merit in the accusation

nissan motor manufacturing corp usa on monday 
announced an anticipated expansion of its car and truck plant in 
tennessee saying it planned to add a third assembly line and use 
it for passenger cars 
the expansion was approved earlier this month by nissans board 
of directors but announcement was held until monday nissan 
already builds its sentra cars and light trucks at the smyrna 
tenn plant 
however the announcement didnt indicate the investment nissan 
would be making in the expansion the kind of car to be made there 
or production dates and capacities 
it said a task force with members from the companys us arm 
and the parent company in japan would study the project for three 
months 
we have been asking for the opportunity to expand our capacity 
for some time said jerry benefield president and chief 
executive officer of nissan motor manufacturing we are very 
happy and proud that our board of directors and parent company have 
given all of us at nissan in tennessee this vote of confidence 
it is the latest in a series of projects nissan has announced 
this year for the united states 
in april nissans board approved spending 311 million to 
begin producing bumpers and assembling engines and truck axles at 
the tennessee plant southeast of nashville 
last month nissan and ford motor co announced a joint venture

and last week nissan research and development inc broke ground 
for a 50 million research and design facility in farmington hills 
northwest of detroit officials said among its projects would be 
designing a new vehicle for the us market 
nissan spokesman david fox said monday that initial plans call 
for most of the new cars built at the smyrna expansion plant to be 
sold in the united states but the company wasnt ruling out 
shipping some cars overseas 
analyst joseph phillippi of the investment firm shearson lehman 
hutton in new york speculated that nissan like honda may be 
positioning itself for penetration of the european market 
i guess the intriguing thing is with respect to europe in 
1992 he said theres a lot of discussion in europe as to what 
is a japanese car and what is a transplant 
if you build a honda here with 80 percent us content is it 
a car from japan or a car from the united states he asked 
european countries have entered into a variety of trade 
agreements quotas and voluntary restraints with japan limiting the 
number of japanese cars coming to the continent 
nissans smyrna plant with a 3200employee work force was 
designed in 1980 with room for expansion the company said as early 
as last february it was looking into expanding the factory 
american honda motor co inc runs two assembly lines in 
marysville ohio and will add a third in east liberty ohio in 
the fall of next year 
toyota motor manufacturing usa inc has a plant near 
georgetown ky which operates one assembly line and shares two

privatization plan is still pending in the delaware court

copper futures prices took their sharpest dive in nearly four 
months monday on new yorks commodity exchange as traders took 
profits after bidding up prices to an alltime high last week 
on other markets precious metals futures declined as energy 
prices tumbled pork bellies rallied strongly livestock futures 
were mixed grains and soybeans were mostly lower and stockindex 
futures retreated 
the comex spot copper price plunged 385 cents to 1414 a pound 
while the contract for delivery in december fell 3 cents to 
13325 the steepest drop in the copper market since july 1 
analysts said copper prices were due for a correction after 
climbing by 60 percent since early august to a record 1465 a 
pound during fridays trading the spot price settled friday below 
the record level reached during the day 
mondays stronger dollar and weaker oil prices provided a 
bearish backdrop for the entire metals complex 
but the strongest sell signal for copper traders appeared to be 
the london metal exchanges report of a 7900metricton decline 
last week in its warehouse stocks of the metal the market had been 
expecting a steeper drop in lme stocks said fred demler metals 
economist with drexel burnham lambert inc in new york 
analyst james steel of refco inc in new york said lme stocks 
of copper have fallen as low as they were late last december when 
spot copper soared to 146 a pound 
although the spot copper price surpassed that level last week 
steel noted the december contract had risen only as high as 1382 
compared with 141 last year 
were still a few cents under last years high and that was 
something of a signal for profittaking he said but its only 
natural to be pullling back and taking some profits after the highs 
of last week 
steel said he expected copper prices to fall further perhaps as 
low as 130 for december delivery before rising again 
fred demler metals economist with drexel burnham lambert inc 
said the december copper price could fall as low as 112 and still 
not break the markets bullish momentum 
precious metals futures prices fell moderately on the comex in 
reaction to the sharp drop in oil prices analysts said 
gold settled 260 to 310 lower with december at 40880 a 
troy ounce silver was 26 cents to 3 cents lower with december at 
6255 a troy ounce 
energy futures plummeted on the new york mercantile exchange in 
reaction to the failure of eight opec oil ministers to reach an 
agreement to curb crudeoil production at a meeting that ended 
during the weekend 
i think this is an example of unrealistic expectations in a 
market ripe for disappointment said peter beutel an energy 
analyst with elders futures inc in new york 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 94 cents to 120 
lower with december at 1317 a barrel heating oil was 184 cents 
to 281 cents lower with november at 3990 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 126 cents to 2 cents lower with november at 4996 
cents a gallon 
frozen pork belly futures prices soared in a technical rally 
inspired by the markets refusal to fall sharply in reaction to 
fridays weekly coldstorage report from the agriculture department 
the usda reported about 1 million more pounds of pork bellies in 
cold storage than the market had expected 
hog prices advanced with the bellies while cattle futures rose 
in reaction to cash cattle prices as high as 74 per hundredweight 
the highest packer price paid since spring analysts said 
live cattle settled unchanged to 47 cent higher with december 
at 7485 cents a pound feeder cattle were 10 cent to 47 cent 
higher with october at 8195 cents a pound hogs were 17 cent to 
55 cent higher with december at 4225 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 160 cents to 175 cents higher with february at 5125 
cents a pound 
grain and soybean futures finished mostly lower on the chicago 
board oftrade amid disappointment over slack export sales and 
improved growing conditions for south american soybeans 
soybeans corn and oats ended substantially lower but wheat 
settled mixed due to a late rebound on news that china was seeking 
400000 metric tons of us wheat at subsidized prices 
wheat settled 3 cents lower to 1 cents higher with december at 
418 a bushel corn was cent to 6 cents lower with december at 
277 a bushel oats were 3 cents to 5 cents lower with december 
at 244 a bushel soybeans were 10 cents lower to 1 cent higher 
with november at 765 a bushel 
stockindex futures closed modestly lower on the chicago 
mercantile exchange where the contract for december delivery of

new regulations for drinking water and waste 
treatment could cost homeowners an average of 100 or more in 
additional municipal fees by 1996 a study by the environmental 
protection agency estimates 
an inhouse agency committee also said farms and some small 
businesses could face significant costs from 85 major regulations 
promulgated in the past year or two or expected in the next few 
years 
the cost estimates for the regulations affecting municipalities 
dealt only with new standards for drinking water waste water 
treatment and solid waste costs for other regulations such as 
asbestos controls in schools could not be derived so the 
committee said it considered its estimates floors that could be 
exceeded 
based on an analysis of the finances of 207 municipalities the 
committee estimated that 21 percent to 30 percent of the smallest 
places with fewer than 2500 people could have trouble raising 
loans or floating bond issues for the capital expenditures the 
regulations will require only 3 percent to 7 percent of towns 
larger than that are expected to have difficulty raising money 
the panel said the states and federal officials may have to 
devise new ways of helping the smaller communities in some cases 
it said smaller towns may need to merge their services 
the panel said the increase in fees taxes and other charges for 
the three environmental services would be highest in the least and 
most populous cities 170 in the smallest towns and 160 in 
cities of more than 250000 
in 20 percent of the smallest places current charges could more 
than double but nationwide only 2 percent of the households would 
see an increase that large 
data for farms as a whole proved harder to come by so the 
committee examined some speciality crops as well as farms of three 
common types an illinois corn and soybean operation of which 
there are about 31000 a mississippi farm growing cotton and 
soybeans of which there are about 1800 and a kansas farm 
producing wheat and cattle of which there are about 20000 
assuming that the agency tried to promulgate regulations with 
minimum costs and that not every farmer in average financial 
condition had to meet every requirement income before depreciation 
would fall by 3 percent for the mississippi and kansas farms and by 
07 percent for the illinois farm 
in the worst case of highcost regulations that all farmers 
would have to meet the illinois farm would lose 26 percent of its 
income the mississippi farm would lose 24 percent and the kansas 
farm would lose 84 percent 
only moderate changes in profits would be expected by producers 
of the specialty crops examined with the important exception of 
new york and michigan apple growers 
in the worst case of highcost fungicide regulations even 
average impacts would mean new york growers could see a drop of 
60 percent in their current 220 net return per acre and michigan 
growers could lose 84 percent of their 80 per acre washington 
returns would barely change from 330 increasing by 02 percent 
because apple prices would rise 
seventy percent of the nations 35 million small businesses 
those with fewer than 50 employees are in nonpolluting fields 
such as wholesale and retail trade finance or other services 
the committee said it was able to identify several industries 
where costs to comply with future regulations had a good chance of 
eating up either 30 percent of annual profits or requiring capital 
expenditures of more than 30 percent of the owners investment 
most prominent are dry cleaners who may be faced with expensive 
controls on solvents and service stations faced with cleaning up 
any leaking underground tanks 
if controls on perchloroethylene the most common solvent are 
required for dry cleaners with nine or fewer employees those 
companies could be faced with new annual costs equaling 35 percent 
of median net profits and capital expenditures of 33 percent of 
median owners investment 
similar figures were not presented for service stations 
however the committee said only the strongest would be able to 
survive if required expenditures were concentrated in a twoyear or 
threeyear period but most could survive if given a longer time 
among other industries examined small electroplaters wood 
preservers and pesticide formulators could have difficulty meeting 
toxic chemical regulations if they have leaking underground tanks 
farm supply stores and trucking companies also could be vulnerable 
small photofinishers were concluded to have no problems since they 
recycle silver compounds and generally do not use other hazardous 
material

two stars of the computer industry reported diverging 
thirdquarter results monday as compaq computer corp recorded a 
59 percent profit gain and cray research inc posted a 37 percent 
decline 
compaq said its profit gain came on a 60 percent increase in 
sales as the houstonbased personal computer maker continued to 
benefit from strong demand for its powerful personal computers 
cray the worlds leading manufacturer of supercomputers said 
its profit drop came on a 21 percent decline in sales it predicted 
a bulge in sales in the fourth quarter resulting in a roughly 10 
percent revenue gain for the full year but said the profit gain 
for the year would be limited to 5 percent to 7 percent because of 
unexpectedly high costs of research and development 
compaq said it earned 58 million or 140 a share on a fully 
diluted basis up from 36 million or 94 cents a share a year 
earlier revenue rose to 5016 million from 3135 million 
for the first nine months of its fiscal year compaq said its 
earnings rose 87 percent to 163 million or 406 a share on a 
fully diluted basis from 87 million or 229 a share a year 
earlier revenue rose 764 percent to 140 billion from 792 
million 
the earnings per share are calculated on the basis of what they 
would be assuming they are diluted by an increase in the number of 
outstanding shares through conversion of all convertible securities 
into common stock 
compaq is the leader in sales of personal computers based on 
intel corps 80386 the chip makers fastest microprocessor 
cray research of minneapolis said its profit in the quarter 
fell to 226 million or 73 cents a share down from 361 
million or 114 a share a year earlier revenue fell to 1452

the kroger co said monday it plans to pay 
later this week the 40 per common share cash dividend that it 
promised shareholders as part of a restructuring to fight off 
takeover bids 
the nations largest supermarket operator said the cash payments 
will be made friday and soon be followed by distribution of 
promised debentures also part of the restructuring plan 
kroger offered the upfront payments to entice shareholders to 
support its plan to reorganize itself into a smaller but still 
independent food retailer 
kroger has pressed ahead with the 46 billion restructuring 
plan it proposed in september despite two outside offers to buy 
the company kroger rebuffed both offers 
the company promised to pay shareholders 40 in cash per common 
share plus 17 in principal on a junior subordinated discount 
debenture intended to have an 8 trading value 
at least four shareholder suits have been filed against kroger 
to challenge its conclusion that the restructuring is a better 
financial alternative than buyout offers from ther investment firm 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co of new york or from the dart group 
inc of landover md 
kohlberg kravis made a 503 billion or 64pershare bid that 
kroger officials said could run into antitrust objections because 
the investment firm has other supermarket holdings kohlberg kravis 
withdrew the bid after it was rejected by kroger 
dart which began the kroger takeover bidding sept 19 offered 
432 billion or 55 per share dart offered to help kroger fight 
the kohlberg kravis bid but has refused to say whether its own 
offer had been withdrawn 
kroger said it would have to sell some company assets including 
stores food processing plants and corporate real estate to offset 
costs of restructuring 
the company also fired about 300 of its 800 cincinnati corporate 
headquarters employees giving them extended pay health care and 
relocation allowances in termination payments on a oneday notice 
the firings did not include personnel in its supermarkets 
the 105yearold company has approximately 170000 employees and 
52000 shareholders kroger operates more than 1300 supermarkets 
900 convenience stores and 15 membership warehouses in 29 states

kraft inc said monday it would give advance 
notice if it decided to proceed with any part of its 136 billion 
defensive restructuring without the approval of its directors and 
shareholders 
krafts statement in federal court in chicago was a victory for 
the company pursuing kraft philip morris cos inc which had 
sought a temporary restraining order asking for three days notice 
of any restructuring moves 
kraft is seeking to boost its debt more than tenfold in order to 
make a huge payout to its shareholders that would convince them not 
to go along with a takeover offer of more than 11 billion from 
philip morris 
us district judge james b moran rejected philip morriss 
request for a temporary restraining order saying it was unneeded 
because of krafts agreement to give advance notice to the court 
philip morris chairman and chief executive hamish maxwell 
criticized the restructuring as lacking in details and being 
dependent upon the breakup of kraft 
the restructuring plan will require burdening what is left 
of kraft with an enormous debt mortgaging its future maxwell 
said 
a spokesperson for kraft said later monday that disparaging 
remarks made by philip morris regarding the recapitalization plan 
are totally consistent with philip morriss pressure tactics to 
buy kraft on the cheap 
some experts agreed with philip morriss criticism of the kraft 
moves arguing that krafts plan fails the litmus test for a 
successful restructuring the company is not mismanaged and its 
assets are not undervalued thereby limiting managements ability 
to squeeze out the extra dollars needed to pay down billions in 
fresh debt 
they cant service debt at that level said ronald morrow 
an analyst at smith barney harris upham amp co referring to 
interest and principal payments that will have to be made on what 
kraft estimates will add up to more than 124 billion in debt 
they cant earn enough from their businesses to cover the 
leverage he said monday adding in jest that kraft is going to 
have to sell off all the assets 
on sunday kraft management rejected as inadequate philip 
morriss 90ashare cash offer and unveiled its own restructuring 
plan valued at 110 a share 
glenview illbased kraft maker of velveeta cheese and 
sealtest ice creams said some noncore businesses would be sold to 
raise cash but the plan also hinges on bank borrowings and the 
issuance of junk bonds in order to pay shareholders 84 a share in 
cash shareholders also would receive securities and retain an 
interest in their common shares 
in heavy trading on the new york stock exchange kraft soared 
10 a share to close at 102 
under these circumstances its either buy the company or 
get had said stephen carnes a managing director at 
minneapolisbased piper jaffray amp hopwood 
but observers also conceded the restructuring might just be a 
strategy designed to goad philip morris into sweetening its offer 
indeed kraft said in a statement that it advised philip morris 
that we were not foreclosing negotiations and that if they were to 
offer a price that reflects the full value of kraft we would 
negotiate 
if that strategy proves successful it would be a plus for 
kraft management said edward froelich an analyst at pershing 
amp co if not it wont be the first time a company has gone to 
the cleaners to stay in business under current management he 
said 
a restructuring if implemented would take its toll on the 
company for several years to come its going to take all the 
earnings out of the company and put them all in dividends 
carnes said it doesnt make a lot of business sense 
kraft has been undergoing a transformation for several years in 
an effort to shed its nonfood operations in 1986 the company 
formed premark international inc to spin off its consumer products 
operations with the 18 billion sale of its duracell batteries 
unit this summer to a management group led by the buyout powerhouse 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co kraft finally returned to its roots 
as a food and food services concern 
theyve really only just become a food company in the last two 
quarters said carnes the restructuring currently on the table 
is the last thing youd do in a normal business environment he 
added 
kraft admitted as much in announcing the restructuring the 
company called the plan a product of current era investment 
policies and financial attitues that favor shortterm financial 
gratification over steady longterm growth and the need to provide 
a sound economy for future generations 
analysts were concerned over which businesses kraft might 
consider selling carnes speculated the companys food ingredients 
business might be on the block kraft sells oils seasonings 
cheese products and other ingredients to food processors and 
foodservice customers 
worse however kraft might opt to sell its frozen foods 
operations as a package partly because the majority of products in 
this category do not carry the kraft name and therefore could be 
easily separated from the company some of the products include 
lenders bagels tombstone pizzas and the budget gourmet 
the whole industry is going into frozen foods said carnes 
lamenting that it would be a real crime if kraft were forced to 
sell one of the trendy businesses

itt corp one of the biggest us companies 
pleaded guilty monday to fraud for treating air force aides to 
liquor food golf and entertainment to get secrets used to bid on 
180 million in military contracts 
the new yorkbased conglomerate faces a maximum 500000 fine in 
us district court on the charge of conspiring to defraud the 
government 
itt admitted an employee of its defense technology division in 
1984 and early 1985 spent about 15000 and was reimbursed for 
illegal gifts to air force officials at hanscom air force base in 
bedford mass 
in exchange itt received copies of internal government 
documents with confidential procurement information on two air 
force programs itt was interested in pursuing 
itt was indicted in june 1987 several months before a separate 
federal investigation into the use of consultants by corporations 
to get information for use in bidding for pentagon contracts 
this office will continue to ferret out and prosecute 
vigorously fraud and corruption in the defense industry us 
attorney frank l mcnamara said in a statement 
edward m vicenzi a senior marketing representative of itts 
van nuys califbased gilfillan subsidiary which specializes in 
radar technology pleaded guilty in july to the same charge he 
faces up to 35 years in prison and a 500000 fine on the charges 
itt officials said the case involved one employee and was not 
tied to the pentagon procurement scandal 
we pleaded guilty to the fact that the person involved was our 
employee when he acted improperly itt chairman rand v araskog 
said in a statement we had no choice because that employee 
pleaded guilty 
its in no way from our standpoint to be compared to that 
pentagon inquiry itt spokesman james gallagher said we are 
not using consultants to gain competitor information which is the 
focus of the pentagon inquiry 
itt was one of the first defense contractors to implement the 
1986 defense industry initiative a set of guidelines recommended 
by a presidential panel on reforming how the pentagon buys weapons 
according to the indictment vicenzi was hired in august 1983 to 
pursue two air force contracts an antiradiation missile decoy 
system valued at more than 80 million and a mobile air traffic 
control radar system worth between 100 million and 150 million 
vicenzis 60000ayear job was to get inside government 
information on the programs including air force plans 
specifications procurement strategy and projected costs the 
indictment said 
he reportedly had close ties with procurement officials at the 
air forces electronics systems division at hanscom responsible 
for buying all air force electronics systems 
four government employees who received gratuities from vincenzi 
gave him copies of documents with information on the contracts as 
well as general planning and funding documents including the 
entire minutes of an air force meeting for the missile decoy 
system the indictment said 
he sent the documents to other itt gilfillan employees 
including senior business development officials engineers and 
program managers writing this is extremely sensitive or do 
not acknowledge our possession of this document 
itt gilfillan won a preliminary 64 million development 
contract for the 80 million missile decoy system which would have 
protected us radar sites by luring homing missiles away the 
indictment said neither that system nor the radar control system 
known as mpnxx was built 
federal prosecutors told the us district judge david s nelson 
that several itt employees tried to coverup vicenzis activities 
by destroying or concealing the documents after word was out of an 
investigation itt said vicenzi was fired in 1986 in an unrelated 
matter 
vicenzi allegedly had repeated contact with maurice raciti a 
deputy program manager in logistics at hanscom who resigned from 
the air force in late 1986 after air force oficials suspended him 
pending the outcome of the federal investigation he has not been 
charged 
the indictment said vicenzi on numerous occasions met with 
raciti and bought him lunches paid for him to play golf 
provided him with tickets to sporting and theater events and gave 
him gifts of liquor
