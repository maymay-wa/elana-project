fire gutted a packed bronx social club sunday 
afternoon killing seven people and injuring more than 30 and 
firefighters efforts were hampered by screaming people trying to 
get to relatives authorities said 
it was sheer panic said firefighter dennis fennell the 
inside of the basement club was burned out and it looked like 
people tried to claw out all of the walls he said 
fire marshals were testing for the presence of flammable 
liquids said john mulligan a spokesman for the fire department 
the origin was considered suspicious because of the fire spread so 
quickly he said 
the streets were filled with screaming people who tried to pull 
equipment from firefighters and get to their friends fennell said 
there were people running around crazy said firefighter 
joseph kisonas when we went to go do our job people were trying 
to fight the tools away from us it was crazy they wanted to pull 
us one way and then another way trying to get us to the people 
trapped in the basement 
firefighters said five bodies were found in the club some still 
in chairs another person died shortly after the fire at a hospital 
and the seventh died about eight hours later at new york 
hospitalcornell medical center a spokeswoman said 
most of the injured including six firefighters and two 
emergency service technicians were suffering from smoke inhalation 
and were taken to hospitals 
mulligan described the club as about 50 feet by 75 feet with 
7foot ceilings between 60 and 100 people were packed inside 
mayor edward i koch who toured the blaze aftermath described 
the club as a rabbit warren 
if people were running for their lives theyd run down blind 
alleys and be trapped said koch who described the space as 
confined and made up of small partitioned cubicles 
its clear that it should have never been opened in the first 
place he said of the club 
philip j burns a deputy fire chief said the private bar known 
to neighbors as the hole was illegal because bars in basements 
are prohibited and the exits were inadequate 
a resident of the area paul govia 25 said the club operated 
24 hours a day police often raided the place he said 
authorities said they have trouble keeping illegal clubs closed 
because there are hundreds in the city 
the fire was reported about 1230 pm and firefighters were 
met by hysterical civilians streaming up the staircase 
mulligan said 
one firefighter told me he literally had to fight his way down 
the stairs mulligan said 
most escaped through the clubs front door and narrow staircase 
but others were able to break through a wall near the back a 
second door on the side of the club was locked mulligan said 
eighteen engine companies nine ladder units and about 150 
firefighters brought the fivealarm blaze under control about 315 
pm mulligan said

omar abakr idris removes his shoes before 
wading through the kneedeep fetid water left behind by the worst 
rains on record in this desert capital 
each step across what used to be a dusty dirt road unleashes an 
overpowering stench the vast expanse of water is contaminated with 
excrement from overflowing pit latrines and from dogs goats and 
donkeys living in the village 
idris village of mayo a shantytown of about 50000 on 
khartoums southeastern fringe was among the areas hardest hit by 
the deluge aug 45 
we are struggling with life here now said idris 48 we 
are without water without food without homes without transport 
without anything 
the storm dumped 84 inches of rain in 14 hours six times the 
amount that fell in all of 1987 for the past 30 years annual 
rainfall has not exceeded 43 inches 
at least 58 people died most as their mud huts collapsed on 
them up to 15 million people more than a third of khartoums 
nearly 4 million inhabitants were left homeless and more than 
150000 dwellings were destroyed according to government figures 
most vulnerable were the people living in mayo and 22 other 
squatter camps around khartoum the illegal settlements hold 
500000 to 700000 people who fled sudans southern civil war and 
widespread drought the vast camps of mud huts and burlapcovered 
shacks are desperately poor and occupy the worst land 
the moslemdominated government at war with the christian and 
animist south long has tried to discourage further settlement in 
the squatter areas it denies the areas any social services and 
forbids the displaced people living there from digging wells 
official neglect threatened to leave most of the displaced 
people beyond the reach of international relief after the storm 
the government initially refused aid but ultimately relented in the 
face of the sheer magnitude of the disaster and the threat of 
epidemics sweeping from the camps 
many relief workers still worry the unplanned areas will receive 
less than their fair share of government aid 
there will be a natural builtin bias towards planned areas 
said bryan wannop resident representative of the un development 
program which is helping coordinate nongovernment relief 
emergency aid has yet to reach most of those affected by the 
flood many of whom live in areas isolated by stagnant lakes which 
have nowhere to drain 
nearly all the mud huts in marzuk an unplanned area of about 
15000 people in omdurman across the nile river from khartoum were 
destroyed or damaged by the rains the people said they needed 
plastic sheeting and tents 
they are very important because the children now are sleeping 
outside said abdullahim kody a resident 
once i had two rooms kody said pointing to a mound of 
hardening mud unfortunately they have fallen down 
kody idris and others interviewed nearly two weeks after the 
disaster said they received no help from anyone and were 
desperately in need of food shelter and medicine 
health officials are predicitng deadly epidemics of waterborne 
diseases as people cut off from drinking water supplies are forced 
to drink from the pools left behind by the rainstorm 
thousands already have developed diarrhea malaria and typhoid 
also are on the rise and cholera is an imminent risk 
dr nicholas ward a world health organization expert on 
diarrheal diseases an immunization predicted 400000 people 
mostly children will get sick and at least 4000 will die 
without treatment as many as 40000 will perish ward 
estimated but he said emergency health clinics established in 
response to the disaster should forestall the worst 
diarrhea kills the young and the weak primarily through 
dehydration and is treatable with a simple rehydrating mixture of 
salt sugar and water but lack of fresh water supplies make even 
this basic therapy difficult 
sudanese authorities blame insufficient supplies for delays in 
granting relief more than 2000 tons of tents blankets medicine 
plastic sheeting food and other items have poured into sudan but 
officials have said it is about a tenth of what is needed 
disorganization and the dilapidated infrastructure of this north 
african nation of 23 million also have hampererd the relief 
operation 
the rains knocked out telephones disrupting coordination 
between the armyrun operation and nongovernmental agencies the 
downpour also created mud bogs of roads already strewn with 
potholes from years of neglect 
another threat comes from the swollen nile river which already 
has swamped some island villages and is brimming near street level 
in the capital officials are not sure when or whether the river 
might overflow into the city 
a pair of british cartographers working with government 
surveyors has begun work on a contour map which will help determine 
how much higher the nile would have to rise before spilling into 
khartoums streets 
in the meantime relief efforts will continue and people like 
osman geragandi koko who lives in a settlement built on a garbage 
pile in north khartoum will do what they must to find food and 
shelter 
previously there was drought and we got through that he 
said we hope to get through this too

when the new us immigration 
law went into effect last year this town in durango cattle country 
500 miles south of el paso texas feared for its future 
for nearly half a century it had supplied mexicans who worked 
legally or illegally in the united states and sent home the dollars 
that helped keep the town going 
but the catastrophe santa maria del oro braced for 14 months ago 
hasnt happened 
thousands of dollars still pour in every day in money orders 
sent by residents relatives working most of them illegally in 
the united states 
mayor epifanio carreon had feared the flow of dollars would dry 
up and worse hundreds of young men would come home looking for 
jobs that dont exist 
we would have seen at least some economic affects of the law 
by now but everything is totally normal carreon says now 
the dollar continues being the most important source of income 
in this region said roberto acosta assistant manager of banco 
internacional the only bank in the area people that cashes dollar 
checks 
some people returned because of fear before they knew what was 
going to happen with the law but now things are back to normal 
one young man in town said however hes waiting to see what 
happens with the law the us immigration control and reform act 
before he attempts his first crossing 
if it werent for the law id already be in los angeles 
said rocky rocha 18 who just graduated from a technical school 
here 
he said two of his brothers already there had applied for 
amnesty under the us law and fear theyll lose out if they harbor 
him as an illegal alien 
if my brothers will let me ill go in spite of the law 
said rocha here you work so hard and you dont make much 
santa maria del oro has supplied the us labor market with a 
steady stream of workers since world war ii 
many residents went to the united states as farm workers under 
the us bracero program of 1942 said mayor carreon by now some 
have gained us citizenship or legal residency 
by the time the program was dropped in 1964 many local 
residents had grown accustomed to having a steady job and earning 
dollars 
besides said carreon the local gold and mining operations were 
winding down and there wasnt much left to do here but work in the 
fields or raise cattle the only major employer around these days 
is a lumber company which has about 300 workers 
miguel angel salinas the municipal clerk estimates that more 
than 30 percent of the towns 14000 people still go back and forth 
to jobs in the united states 
authorities estimate the percentage of people on surrounding 
farms and ranches with relatives working in the united states is as 
high or even higher 
carreon said the steady flow of dollars as much as 60000 a 
week has helped santa maria del oro weather mexicos 6yearold 
economic crisis 
indeed by mexican standards santa maria del oro is well off 
the main streets are filled with latemodel us and mexican 
pickup trucks many bearing us license plates there are no 
beggars on the streets many of the homes and businesses were 
financed with dollars 
residents and public officials here say the law has helped those 
who hve been in the united states for a long time and wanted to 
stay there 
manuel sanchez returned several years ago and bought a butcher 
shop with the money he earned as an undocumented worker in chicago 
his brother a chicago butcher stayed and has applied for 
amnesty the provision of the law allowing foreigners who meet 
certain requirements to seek legal residency 
he feels a lot safer knowing that when he leaves the house in 
chicago hell return sanchez said 
illegal aliens caught in the united states most often are 
deported immediately 
for others who didnt qualify for amnesty under the law or just 
didnt bother to apply its business as usual a sundown trek 
across the border 
well stay as long as theres work when theres not well 
come back crying said jesus chavez 29 who has worked in the 
united states as an undocumented worker for a decade 
right now the work is there waiting for us said chavez one 
of three brothers working without documents at a california 
construction company 
chavez home on vacation said the 21 an hour he earns makes 
the risk of crossing as an illegal alien worthwhile 
similar work in mexico probably would pay him about 12 a day 
right now it the law hasnt affected us at all said luis 
chavez jesus 18yearold brother who began working illegally in 
the united states when he was 14 
the toughest provision of the us law went into effect this 
past june 1 making it illegal for most employers to knowingly hire 
undocumented workers the law calls for stiff fines and even jail 
sentences for violators 
agricultural workers now in the united states have been given an 
extension to dec 1 to get their papers in order or leave 
although crossing the border without legal documents is the 
risky part those whove worked in the same job in the united 
states since before 1982 dont have to show employers their 
documents

as the smoke clears in the persian gulf 
war with a unsponsored truce iran and iraq are counting the 
cost of a conflict that killed an estimated 1 million people but 
ended with no victor 
peace talks scheduled to start thursday in geneva are likely to 
be long and tough iran and iraq are ancient enemies and eight 
years of war have only deepened old hatreds 
both countries bled by the war face mammoth tasks in 
rebuilding their economies despite the oil wealth they used to 
bankroll their military machines 
iran also faces the prospect of political turmoil as hardliners 
such as interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi a vociferous critic 
of defeatist diplomatic efforts to end the war and more 
pragmatic leaders particularly parliament speaker hashemi 
rafsanjani battle for supremacy 
rafsanjani considered the most powerful figure in iran after 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini is widely seen as the man who 
engineered tehrans unconditional acceptance of the un ceasefire 
resolution last month when he realized irans military machine was 
weakening after a string of battlefield defeats this year 
khomeini endorsed rafsanjanis decision widely seen as the 
speakers biggest political gamble although the ailing patriarch 
stressed that for him ending the war was worse than drinking 
poison 
so far no senior iranian leader has publicly challenged that 
decision which most iranians have welcomed after eight years of 
appalling human loss 
but rafsanjani who also has made clear he seeks to end irans 
isolation faces an increasingly strong array of radicals led by 
mohtashemi and the prosecutorgeneral mohammad khoeinihia leader 
of the militants who seized the us embassy in tehran in november 
1979 who oppose his pragmatist policies 
they consider his efforts to end a war he clearly believed iran 
could never win flies in the face of the revolutions aim of 
spreading islamic fundamentalism 
analysts say the internal struggle for supremacy after khomeini 
which has been swelling over the last two years as the patriarchs 
health deteriorated has only been intensified by tehrans 
acceptance of the ceasefire 
on the ground the two belligerents wound up virtually where 
they started in september 1980 when iraq invaded iran the map 
unchanged after one of the longest conventional wars this century 
iraqs president saddam hussein whose 1980 invasion is seen by 
military analysts a major blunder has emerged at least for now 
more solidly entrenched in power in baghdad 
iraq which spent as much as 10 billion a year on its war 
effort is as much as 85 billion in debt according to western 
economists that makes it one of the worlds biggest debtor nations 
the war cost iran an estimated 400 billion although it still 
has about 5 billion in foreign reserves its economy is in 
tatters its industry particularly its oil installations pounded 
by iraqs powerful air force 
khomeini whose hatred of hussein turned the war into a bloody 
vendetta remains the unchallenged authority in iran 
but his surprise decision last month to accept the ceasefire 
despite his exhortations to fight to the last drop of blood to 
topple the iraqi leader has dented the 88yearold religious 
patriarchs credibility 
the iraqis armed with superior weaponry and technology won 
something simply by surviving irans humanwave offensives and 
wearing down the numerically superior iranians although iraq used 
outlawed chemical weapons and hammered iranian cities with bombers 
and missiles 
iran virtually friendless and starved of the arsenal of 
hightech weaponry the iraqis employed can claim that it repelled 
the invaders and fought them to a standstill 
the war undoubtedly helped cement khomeinis 1979 islamic 
revolution opponents of the clericdominated tehran regime charge 
that the fundamentalists deliberately perpetuated the conflict to 
consolidate the infant republic and khomeinis stern brand of islam 
with an end to the war now a possibility the arab countries of 
the oilrich gulf who were caught in the crossfire and the rest of 
the moslem world are heaving a collective sigh of relief 
but an end to the war will have strategic repercussions far 
beyond the gulf 
israel fears that iraq which has participated to some extent in 
every arabisraeli war over the last four decades eventually will 
turn its combathardened military machine again on the jewish state 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said last month that although he 
did not see any danger of an imminent iraqi attack the military 
buildup by arab states spawned by the gulf war could be used 
against israel 
with the gulf war out of the way the arab states are expected 
to refocus their attention on efforts to solve the older 
arabisraeli conflict 
if rafsanjani and his supporters such as foreign minister ali 
akbar velayati succeed in outmaneuvering their hardline 
opponents in tehran irans relations with the west are likely to 
improve 
that in turn has raised hopes that iran can be persuaded to 
use its influence with proiranian shiite extremists in lebanon to 
free foreign hostages including nine americans

five years after dissident leader 
benigno aquino was killed the slaying remains unsolved and his 
goal of a peaceful stable democracy unfulfilled in the turbulent 
country now governed by his widow 
on aug 21 1983 the senator stepped from a china airlines jet 
and into philippine history gunned down moments after returning 
from the united states to challenge president ferdinand marcos for 
leadership of the philippines 
the killing outraged the nation and emboldened a fragmented 
opposition paving the way for the uprising that toppled marcos and 
propelled corazon aquino to the presidency on feb 25 1986 
now statues of ninoy the senators nickname stand in 
major cities and the airport where he died bears his name mrs 
aquino has said repeatedly that if it were not for his death she 
never would have risen to power 
but the trial of 40 defendants charged in the assassination 
drags on nearly 16 months after it began bogged down in a complex 
legal system 
in september 1986 the supreme court voided acquittals handed 
down by a marcosera tribunal and ordered a retrial the slow pace 
of the trial typifies the unfinished agenda of an administration 
made possible by the aquino slaying 
the political turbulence that made such a killing possible 
haunts the country for many the lofty hopes that marcos ouster 
alone would restore stability and prosperity have given way to 
frustration 
five years after ninoys death the cory government has become 
the government it warned us against wrote columnist conrado de 
quiros in the philippine daily globe a frequent critic of the 
administration 
critics in the freewheeling manila press often ignore mrs 
aquinos accomplishments preferring instead to hold her to the 
idealistic promises of justice domestic peace and social reform 
she espoused 
despite the insurgency and rightwing coup plots her 
administration drafted a new constitution restored a bicameral 
legislature and held national and regional elections in its first 
two years 
the administration reversed three years of economic decline and 
posted a 55 percent growth in the gross national product in its 
first full year 
but for millions of filipinos more than 60 percent of whom live 
in poverty the slow pace of change has done little to improve 
their daily lives inflation in the manila area triggered by 
increases in prices of food and fuel is approaching 10 percent 
allegations of continuing corruption have been raised not only 
by the press but by manila archbishop cardinal jaime sin the 
countrys best known cleric and an aquino supporter 
communist rebels still wield power in rural areas and urban 
guerrillas have escalated street assassinations in the capital 
itself rightwing death squads have retaliated with their own 
attacks against labor activists and suspected leftists 
if the principal element of aquinos death was violence it 
is only fitting that the people who were shocked by the incident 
and who felt sorry for the late senator should now shun violence 
and work to strengthen the rule of law said the manila bulletin 
in an editorial sunday violence still stalks the land because 
many do not respect the rule of law 
growing disaffection prompted vice president salvador laurel 
this month to accuse the administration of incompetence failing to 
stem the rebellion and tolerating corruption on the scale of 
marcos laurel called on mrs aquino to resign and call new 
elections 
although laurels allegations were similar to those of some of 
mrs aquinos supporters his charges won little public support 
mostly because of the vice presidents reputation as a political 
opportunist 
but if laurels purpose was to jolt cory aquino into waking 
up from her dream presidency and facing the nightmare it has become 
for the filipino people then it certainly deserves a fair and just 
assessment wrote columnist nestor mata in the manila standard 
mrs aquinos strongest supporters frequently dismiss criticism 
as attempts by her opponents to undermine her government 
proaquino columnists claim the latest round of criticism is part 
of a rightwing plot to tarnish her reputation among the public 
under the aquino regime blame is immediately being heaped on 
faceless nameless people who are out to destabilize the 
government wrote columnist ninez cachoolivarez in the 
philippine daily inquirer it is the insecure and paranoid who 
see goblins at every turn 
meanwhile mrs aquino herself has become more isolated from the 
philippine press she rarely gives press conferences or interviews 
recently the presidential palace banned ambush interviews 
where reporters would shout questions at the president as she 
walked to her office every morning

into the indiana national guard headquarters unit sen dan quayle 
joined in may 1969 guard officials said saturday 
the existence or nonexistence of any waiting list as to hhd 
quayles unit cannot be verified due to the fact that no such

candidate questions have been raised as to whether he used family 
influence to gain entrance to the guard 
owens and moorhead point out that records show the headquarters 
unit quayle joined had vacanies the month before the month of and 
the month after the senators enlistment 
quayles unit had an authorized strength of 138 soldiers but had 
134 people in april 132 in may and 133 in june brig gen james

eager kids and traditional summer fare like corn on the cob 
butterfly porkchop sandwiches cotton candy and snow cones 
but its not the same 
you dont feel like eating said don carlson 66 of 
belvidere at the illinois state fair in springfield you want

and the ice cream melts so fast said his wife vi 
the parched hot summer that has turned city lawns brown and

and even some casualties

the 97degree heat and livestock exhibitors were taking extra 
precautions to keep their animals comfortable in fairground barns 
theyre packing some down with ice theyre putting ice in 
front of fans to blow cool air fisher said theyre coming up 
with some ingenious ways to handle the heat stress 
although state fairs in the heartland traditionally draw 
millions of people each year attendance is down somewhat this 
summer in some states 
fairgoers cheer or challenge in contests ranging from 
horseracing to horseshoes from husbandcalling to hogcalling 
they relax with rock music and symphonies they scrutinize 
blueribbon displays of produce or livestock or home crafts they 
ride the rides or line up to try the midway games of skill for pink 
pandas or funny hats they inspect displays of new farm machinery 
some forget their troubles for the moment 
it is a time that you can just go and forget all about the 
corn or other headaches that you have said dana trimble 
manager of a company that grows seed corn trimble plays drums and 
his farmer father gene plays trumpet with a band of strolling 
players in clown gear at the illinois fairgrounds every year 
people kind of want to get away from the farm its been a 
tough year said john e ward board president for the indiana

rain during the fair waddell said

and lemonade said fair manager bernie lennon it will be a 
little oasis

attendance as the fair began its 11day run thursday butch webb of 
wichita kan working in 104degree heat wednesday to prepare the 
fairgrounds said that while this summer was a little bit

contenders 
tony misich of clinton ohio said the potatoes cucumbers 
peppers and onions are the smallest from his garden hes shown in 
10 years at the fair

a mercedes packed with explosives blew up 
sunday near a syrian army checkpoint in moslem west beirut 
wounding 18 people and damaging cars and buildings police said 
no group immediately claimed of responsibility for the bombing 
in the seaside raouche district which came during a confrontation 
between prosyrian forces and hardline proisrael christians over 
the election of a new president 
the creamcolored mercedes packed with an estimated 88 pounds 
of tnt detonated at 840 am only six feet from the checkpoint 
opposite a fish restaurant police said it was not known whether 
the bomb was detonated by remote control or a timing device 
police said three syrian soldiers at the sandbagged checkpoint 
were among the casualties most of the other wounded were lebanese 
civilians including women and children 
at least eight cars parked nearby were destroyed the 
restaurants glass front was blown in and windows in several 
neighboring buildings were shattered 
hours later police said another car rigged with two rockets was 
safely defused in south beiruts seaside ouzai district 
the car was parked in front of a bakery about 50 yards from a 
syrian checkpoint police said the 107mm rockets were equipped with 
a timing device but did not say when they were set to go off 
police said the merecedes that exploded was parked saturday 
evening near the restaurant atop a cliff overlooking the 
mediterranean on a winding hilltop road popular with morning 
strollers 
several unexploded hand grenades and a mortar shell were found 
in the wreckage of the car police said 
had they exploded it would have been a real disaster said 
a police officer at the scene who spoke on condition of anonymity 
nervous syrian troops armed with rocketpropelled grenades and 
automatic rifles sealed off the blast scene firing in the air to 
make room for red cross ambulances rushing victims to hospitals 
glass shards from the mayfair casino and a string of oceanside 
fish restaurants littered a radius of 150 yards around the blast 
scene 
i heard a powerful explosion that hurled me several meters 
pieces of glass rained on me said a 28yearold casino employee 
who declined to be named 
the car bombing was the 11th in lebanon this year by police 
count 103 people have been killed and 353 wounded in the 10 
previous car bombings 
the attacks have been a byproduct of lebanons 13yearold civil 
war between moslems and christians which has claimed more than 
130000 lives since it broke out in 1975 
fears of of a new outbreak of violence have been fueled by a 
presidential election deadlock that threatens to create a power 
vacuum after president amin gemayels sixyear term in office 
expires sept 23 
christian hardliners backed by the lebanese forces the nations 
main civil war militia prevented the election of syrianbacked

while the republicans almost certainly will be 
blessed with a buoyant economy through election day inflation and 
rising interest rates could shove the country into a recession as 
early as next spring some economists are warning 
a few analysts are forecasting a downturn for next year and 
many who arent say it will take luck to avoid a recession 
ironically one of the things that has them worried is that 
economic growth has been so robust lately 
a boom in us export sales has helped push the nations 
unemployment rate down to 14year lows 
the gross national product has expanded at an annual rate of 31 
percent during the first six months of the year and there are 
indications that the economy may be growing even faster in the 
current julyseptember quarter 
this rapid growth in demand is beginning to push up against 
supply restraints because of tight labor markets and high operating 
rates in many industries 
this often translates into rising inflationary pressures as 
workers demand higher wages and businesses boost product prices 
to nip inflation before it gets out of hand the federal reserve 
since late march has been pushing up interest rates to dampen 
demand earlier this month it boosted its discount rate onehalf 
percentage point to 65 percent 
an increase in the discount rate is the most dramatic signal the 
central bank can send of its inflationfighting intentions 
that is what worries economists most recessions in this country 
are brought on by a credit squeeze while the central bank doesnt 
set out to create a downturn it often finds it difficult to walk 
the fine line between dampening demand to cool inflationary 
pressures and tightening so much that a new recession is triggered 
the famous softlanding for the economy has proven very 
difficult to manage in the past said robert dederick chief 
economist for the northern trust co of chicago 
dederick said he believed the current expansion now in its 
peacetime record 69th month will head into a new slump by the end 
of next year 
economists at the new york investment firm of merrill lynch said 
in their latest forecast that growth could stall by next summer as 
higher interest rates and a loss of export momentum take their toll 
david wyss an economist with data resources inc said next 
spring will be the beginning of the danger time for the economy 
given the six to nine month lag between increases in interest rates 
and their greatest impact on borrowing 
we are forecasting that we will be able to avoid a recession 
next year and just have a slowdown but the risk of a recession is 
certainly there if the federal reserve gets carried away with 
tightening he said 
under some optimistic scenarios the expansion will moderate as 
higher interest rates cut into consumer and business demand but 
strong export sales will provide a boost to manufacturing and 
prevent a recession 
another theory sees inflation rising at a faster clip forcing 
the fed to take stronger action which will send such key 
interestrate sensitive sectors as housing into a tailspin with 
the weakness then spreading to the rest of the economy 
with mortgage rates climbing lately the national association of 
home builders has already complained that the feds credit 
tightening threatened to make the housing industry a sacrificial 
lamb 
while the reagan administration expressed its disappointment at 
the feds recent discount rate hike economists said the credit 
tightening so far should not cause any appreciable slowdown before 
the nov 8 election good news for gop presidential candidate 
george bush who hopes continued signs of prosperity will translate 
into votes 
michael penzer an economist with the bank of america in san 
francisco said he believed interest rates would keep rising until 
next february when the fed would reverse course after seeing signs 
that its tightening was having the desired effect of slowing gnp 
growth 
we have a fairly rosey scenario in which the fed lucks out 
he said 
economists who are not ready to write the obituary for the 
expansion say the current recovery from the 198182 downturn has 
proven remarkably resilient and may have a couple of more years of 
life 
this expansion has had nine lives said jerry jasinowski 
chief economist of the national association of manufacturers it 
has rebounded from a flood of imports in the mid1980s high real 
interest rates and the loss of 1 trillion of wealth during the 
1987 stock market collapse

third world countries need 43 billion worth 
of repairs to their roads including many of their key 
thoroughfares because over the last decade they failed to spend 
12 billion or less to maintain them the world bank says in a 
report 
the largest sum 11 billion is needed in latin america and 
the caribbean followed by 93 billion in east asia and the 
pacific and another 93 billion in the poorer countries of the 
middle east north africa and europe 
the banks experts said they were talking about a third of all 
paved roads outside of towns and a quarter of the unpaved roads in 
85 countries they found that 40 percent of the paved roads will 
need repair in the next 10 years at a cost of another 40 billion 
in 1984 the most recent year for which the report gives 
figures the countries concerned put out 65 billion for repair 
and maintenance 
but if these countries do not improve the management of roads 
the eventual cost of restoration could easily increase two to 
threefold and the cost to users could rise even more the report 
warned 
the world bank owned by 151 countries is the biggest single 
source of loans to help poor countries raise their living 
standards it has lent about 155 billion for roads since it was 
founded at the end of world war ii 
routine maintenance can cost as little as 480 a mile while 
rebuilding can cost more than 480000 a mile the report said 
the experts found the hard core of the problem in southern 
africa they took 61 third world countries all over the world and 
found that 16 of them had budgets too small to pay for the roads 
they need of those 16 there were 11 where citizens incomes have 
been declining nine of the 11 are south of the sahara 
they found a different problem in china india pakistan 
bangladesh and burma many of their roads were built long ago in 
ways that do not suit todays traffic and should simply be 
replaced the report said

its beginning to look like a daily habit a man 
in a white tuxedo hops out of a limousine and spends a couple of 
minutes handing out 50 bills to passersby before being driven off 
but on saturday there was a slight difference this time the 
limo pulled up outside a greektown bar instead of grocery stores 
in detroit and northville where apparently the same man appeared 
thursday and friday 
he was in and out in 30 seconds said bar patron john godin 
of belleville at first i turned it the money down because i 
didnt know what it was 
but godin had second thoughts and took one of the bills it was 
unclear how much money the man has given away

the bartenders dreaded cry of last orders 
will not ring out in english pubs monday afternoon for the first 
time since world war i 
instead thanks to new laws that permit allday drinking pubs 
that open at 11 am can continue serving beer and spirits until 
closing time at 11 pm 
were hoping for a big crowd said mick mccoy assistant 
manager of the hog in the pound pub near the oxford street shopping 
district were stacked up with beer weve taken on a couple 
of extra people just in case 
other pub owners who have lost trade to fastfood restaurants 
will expand their lunch menus one even plans to sell tea and 
scones 
under the old system pubs were forced to close from 3 pm 
until 530 pm the bartenders warning at 250 pm created a rush 
for one last pint and 10 minutes later to the cry of time 
gentlemen please the fun was over 
the government imposed the rule in 1915 to curb drinking by 
munitions workers scotland went to allday drinking in 1977 but 
the restriction held in the 68000 english and welsh pubs until 
monday 
the british medical association opposes the extended hours 
fearing increased alcoholrelated illness and drunkendriving 
accidents but no increase in alcohol abuse or surge in consumption 
was detected in scotland 
home secretary douglas hurd the cabinet minister responsible 
for liquor laws likened the old restriction to a corset a 
straitjacket which has no particular rhyme or reason 
parliament agreed and voted overwhelmingly in april to do away 
with the 2hour afternoon dry period on monday through saturday 
which has frustrated britons and tourists alike 
a controversial amendment slipped in by the unelected house of 
lords extends opening times by one hour on sunday which has always 
had shorter drinking hours sunday hours were noon to 2 pm and 7 
pm to 1030 pm they are now noon to 3 pm and 7 pm to 1030 
pm 
next to tvgazing dropping into the neighborhood pub is 
britains most popular leisure activity said kenneth dunjohn 
spokesman for the brewers society representing most of britains 
117 breweries 
the pub is where neighbors still more men than women 
congregate to play darts work the slot machines and argue about 
soccer and politics 
its also the original fastfood outlet in addition to a 
smorgasbord of beer from light lagers to strong dark ales and 
other alcohol pubs serve traditional english food like 
steakandkidney pie and bangers and mash 
but pub attendance has been falling since 1979 when a recession 
hit britains heavy industries and cut bluecollar spending power 
dunjohn said 
faced with competition from fastfood chains and wine bars 
which arrived in britain in the same period the beer market has 
gone flat 
beer consumption fell to 190 pints per capita a year in 1986 
from 208 pints in 1976 although measured in terms of pure alcohol 
consumption rose to 92 liters in 1986 from six liters in 1966 
pub managers and breweries which own or have exclusive sales 
agreements with thousands of pubs hope the new hours will 
revitalize business 
pubs will expand their food service to meet the afternoon trade 
predicted joe boyle marketing manager for brewers ind coope taylor 
walker ltd which operates more than 700 pubs in london the 
british tourist authority expects 50000 new jobs will be created 
in pubs and the catering trade 
the sherlock holmes pub near trafalgar square plans to serve 
full cream teas scones strawberry jam the works every 
afternoon 
as far as i can see the house pub will be more of a coffee 
shop in the afternoon than a drinking house said john williams 
who manages the pub with his wife jean i dont think the 
average british person after the initial shock is going to be 
affected its more of a touristy thing 
only those pubs in busy tourist or commercial areas are expected 
to take advantage of the new hours while those in residential 
areas will continue to close in the afternoon 
the national association of licensed house managers which 
represents 13000 pub managers had feared increased overhead costs 
would push up beer prices if all pubs had to open in the afternoon 
beer prices have risen three to four pence 5 cents recently 
but the breweries insist its not because of the new hours the 
going price for a pint of beer is 85 pence 150

the hills of massachusetts are alive 
again with the sounds of polkas waltzes and military marches as 
town bands make a comeback in onceabandoned band shells and 
gazebos 
retired musicians teenagers and middleage mothers who havent 
played an instrument since high school are jumping on the bandwagon 
you have no idea how much fun it is said roger voisin a 
former first trumpet of the boston symphony orchestra and a 
thirdgeneration town band musician his grandfather conducted the 
municipal band in the french city of angers 
the legacy continues voisins 15yearold granddaughter 
jennifer roy sits behind him in the great barrington band shell 
that was built last year to replace the 1904 bandstand that had 
disappeared from its spot in front of town hall in the 1940s 
every once in a while ill do a solo or a particularily 
difficult piece and ill feel a little pat on my back as if to 
say good job grandpa he said 
band shells sprung up in parks across the united states in the 
1800s but fell victim to radio movie theaters and television sets 
in the middle of this century several band shells were destroyed 
others simply were abandoned 
one of the few towns that managed to keep the tradition going 
despite the lure of other pasttimes was shelburne falls which 
boasts the secondoldest continuously operating town band in the 
nation the band has played every summer since its founding in 1835 
its secretary shirley donelson believes the band may be the 
oldest 
the 30member shelburne falls military band includes one player 
with at least a halfcentury of service and three players with more 
than 40 years in the group among the players are a farmer a 
retired fire chief a college music professor and a few high school 
students 
the band even has uniforms a luxury among most bands the 
40member montague community band provides shirts but asks that 
musicians bring their own chairs 
mrs donelson 54 said she took up the saxophone she had left 
behind in high school and joined the band as soon as her children 
grew up i didnt have time when i was raising a family she 
said 
her husband walt 55 has beat the bass drum for the group 
every summer since 1952 a carpenter he designed and built the 
town band shell in 1970 
i do it for the fun of it he said if i did it for the 
money id be done years ago 
like all town bands the shelburne falls band depends mostly on 
the generosity of the board of selectmen to keep going but it also 
raises money by charging fees for marching in other communities 
the 50member pulaski brass band in webster celebrated its 99th 
year on aug 14 by marching a few blocks from its headquarters the 
polish american citizens club to st josephs church where it 
was started by five men 
the band has missed only a few summers during world war ii 
since its beginning and has never had trouble recruiting members 
say 
we have no dues and no auditions walter motyka a 37year 
veteran of the group told the worcester telegram we had a 
fellow once who really had no musical ability so we let him crash 
the cymbals

the retreat of contra rebels and 
supporters to remote honduran base camps threatens the survival of 
the insurgency to oust nicaraguas leftist sandinista government 
the action also reverses months of political and military 
advances 
officials at the rebel camps said more than 14000 contra troops 
and civilians crossed the coco river border in the past four months 
into yamales in the steep honduran mountains rebel officers 
estimate that no more than 2000 fighters remain in the northern 
nicaraguan hills 
the rebels blame the withdrawal on the united states which on 
feb 29 cut off military aid a bargaining chip they say for 
discussions to end the war that began in 1981 congress has voted 
to grant only nonlethal aid distributed in honduras 
our forces cant stay in nicaragua surrounded by sandinista 
troops without bullets in their rifles enrique bermudez the 
rebel commander and member of the contra political directorate 
said recently military aid must be a threat to the sandinistas 
to continue negotiating we need to convince congress we enter from 
a position of strength 
thousands of troops many in new us army uniforms wait at the 
base camps occasionally falling into formation they buoy each 
others morale playing baseball and checkers on homemade boards 
with toothpaste caps makeshift tents of wood stakes covered with 
plastic or ponchos dot the hillsides 
the population of the refugee camps swelled from 8000 at the 
start of 1987 to more than 13000 at the end of june honduras 
claims that up to 200000 nicaraguans live illegally in its 
territory 
at one of the camps new arrivals their clothes tattered from 
more than a month of walking worked under the tropical sun to 
clear the brush many of the civilians said they followed the 
troops because they would suffer sandinista repression without 
contra protection 
if we had aid all our troops would be inside nicaragua 
said a 37yearold contra official whose nom de guerre is commander 
johnson it will take a long time to get back to where we were 
the first contras came from the ranks of the national guard 
under dictator anastasio somoza who was ousted in a 1979 
revolutionary war that brought the sandinisatas to power a dozen 
rebels received training in argentina in 1981 and others were 
taught by ciacontracted argentine instructors at honduran base 
camps the cia was also held responsible for air drops of weapons 
food and other supplies 
the contras reputation as an unsavory band of ragtag thugs 
whose troops murdered civilians and kidnapped youths began changing 
in 1986 peasants and young people joined their ranks which 
swelled above 10000 
congress approved a 100 million military and humanitarian aid 
package in june 1986 by the following spring the rebels 
wellarmed and many trained in the united states moved out of 
their honduran base camps into nicaragua 
the sandinistas accused the contras of forcing recruitment and 
of a record number of human rights abuses 
asked about the abuses johnson acknowledged there are still 
revenge killings by both sides but its not a policy of our 
organization 
the rebels had their greatest battlefield and political gains 
against the sovietbacked sandinista government in 1987 they 
became more popular when the government drew increasing criticism 
for the failing economy mandatory recruitment and repression 
but the rebel advances of last year suffered setbacks in recent 
months 
in a surprise move three weeks after us military aid ended 
feb 29 the sandinistas and the contra civilian directorate signed 
an agreement to seek a negotiated settlement to the war 
the ceasefire plan prohibited the fighters from receiving any 
militery aid but allowed nonlethal supplies to be distributed 
inside nicaragua by a neutral international organization 
congress citing the pact withheld further military aid and in 
march allocated 155 million for supplies ranging from food to 
uniforms and 177 million for medical aid to child war victims 
the supplies were to be distributed in honduras by the us agency 
for international development 
at about the same time deep divisions emerged among the rebels 
some contra commanders who signed the peace plan charged 
commanderinchief enrique bermudez with corruption and called for 
a barracks uprising 
the dissidents were purged and the troops rallied around 
bermudez who opposed the ceasefire 
bermudez a former colonel in somozas national guard was 
elected in july to the sevenmember contra political directorate 
and was said to have resigned his post as the military 
commanderinchief however he clearly remains in control 
bermudez who recently visited the camps listened as soldiers 
complained about the diet of rice and beans many of the ew 
arrivals are to start military training in september while some of 
the civilians and fighters will head for nearby refugee camps run 
by the united nations 
but rebel officials said thousands of other fighters and 
civilians were expected to cross the border into honduras soon 
felix mendoza a honduran farmer who allows the contras to use 
his land said incredible numbers of rebels had entered in 
recent days 
nicargua will soon be empty said mendoza 
bermudez called the cutoff of american aid a tragedy for 
central america and said he will seek support from other 
governments or private donors 
commander augustin 29 a company leader who has been fighting 
for seven years said i didnt want to come back here we still 
have some bullets but we needed clothes boots and food 
were willing to fight until the last drop of blood we want 
liberty in our country said the officer

death may be a constant but the rituals 
change with the times as a museum dedicated to dying and 
bereavement illustrates 
old embalming tools a 1917 ford modelt hearse that doubled as

1500pound glass casket are some of the memorabilia in fred 
hunters funeral museum one of a handful in the united states 
if we can teach a little to a student and help families 
understand the history that death is natural this helps them 
understand theres a heritage to this process the whole funeral 
process is a part of growing of letting go said hunter 
hunter is president of national selected morticians a

a thirdgeneration funeral director and antique enthusiast 
hunter inherited some displays from his father and grandfather 
after he bought a large collection in 1986 there was no longer 
room to show them off at his business the museum opened last year 
next to hunters funeral home 
the 1200 visitors have included mourners who stopped by after a 
funeral tourists who have stumbled upon it and students from local 
high schools or community colleges 
a lot of times people sitting here will see the museum and 
well open it for them it answers a lot of questions said steve 
plescia grief counselor at hunters 
learning funeral history is a good way to brace for the future 
said roberta halporn director of the new york citybased center 
for thanatology research and education a nonprofit group that 
studies dying death and grieving 
this is a deathdenying culture so when it happens the pain 
is almost double people without experience tend to want to 
eliminate everything no funeral but each part of the ritual has 
significance she said 
when these rituals are established and practiced it starts 
the bereavement process going in a healthy way halporn said 
south florida career guidance teacher kay anderson agrees she 
has taken piper high school students considering allied health 
careers on field trips to hunters for years 
as weird as it sounds it really is a good learning 
experience part of managing a career is understanding death its 
a good thing because kids at this age have no experience with 
death she says 
for hunter the museum reflects the changes in american culture 
the way funerals changed mirrors the way families changed 
at the turn of the century funerals were still family reunions 
morticians visited homes to prepare the body often laid out in 
parlors and built madetomeasure coffins 
on the day of the funeral he would come again with his coffin 
and put the body in it and go to the church hunter said 
as people moved to cities wakes moved out of houses and funeral 
homes were born 
coffins used to be tapered on the ends and their inner metal 
liners were soldered they are no longer tapered and now have 
selfsealing rubber gaskets 
during the victorian era wreaths were fashioned from hair 
generally that of the deceased and a family might weave a huge 
multihued wreath over several generations 
hearses once regularly doubled as ambulances a practice that 
ended with regulations that ambulances be painted white that was 
hardly appropriate for a funeral vehicle hunter said stroking his 
gleaming black modelt which won first prize as an ambulance 
at the antique automotive club of americas 1982 show 
not all industry innovations caught on like the solid glass 
casket on display 
you take the 1500 pounds and add another 175 pounds and we 
put that in a modelt hearse and youve just flattened the tires 
hunter said its like one giant coke bottle 
other funeral museums around the nation include a small display 
owned by tj beggs and sons funeral home of madison near 
tallahassee and a traveling museum run by the illinois funeral 
directors association of springfield 
hunters museum also houses a collection of 1900era anatomy 
books for student morticians yellowing funeral bills and complete 
issues of the trade journal the casket dating back to 1892 
hunter sees industry changes ahead such as more cremations 
people paying for funerals in advance and the terminally ill opting 
to die in their own beds instead of in hospitals 
the death pattern is changing he said we go to homes 
more often than we did five years ago

a mother who won a twoyear fight to enroll 
her 6yearold aidsafflicted daughter in school finds her victory 
bittersweet 
this is the closest eliana has been to a classroom but i 
cant send her to school to sit in a cage rosa martinez said 
the 36yearold licensed practical nurse has struggled to give 
her daughter who weighed 10 pounds when she was adopted at about 
11 months a home and medical care now shes fighting for an 
education for eliana 
mrs martinez is appealing a ruling by us district judge 
elizabeth kovachevich allowing eliana to start school aug 29 
provided she remains behind a glass partition isolated from other 
children in the classroom 
her attorney expects it to become a landmark case 
the issues in this case involve critically important national 
policy said steve hanlon who is taking the case to the 11th 
us circuit court of appeals in atlanta its going to have 
longlasting precedential effects 
ms kovachevich ruled that eliana who is retarded may attend 
manhattan exceptional center a school for disabled children but 
the judge spelled out restrictions 
in the classroom eliana must stay isolated inside a specially 
built glass booth until she is toilettrained and stops sucking her 
fingers other children may play with her only if their parents 
sign consent forms 
the enclosure located toward the back of the room must be 
8by10 feet with a large plexiglass window and sound system its 
to have a toilet and desk an aide would be assigned to eliana full 
time 
hillsborough county school officials fought attempts to admit 
eliana to the classroom they feared she might transmit to others 
the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus through bodily fluids 
however the judge wrote no aids cases have been proved to have 
been transmitted through exposure to urine feces or saliva even 
though the virus that causes the disease has been found in these 
bodily secretions 
aids according to the federal centers for disease control is 
spread most often through sexual contact needles or syringes 
shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products and from 
pregnant women to their offspring 
for the past year a teacher has come to elianas home an hour a 
day school officials wanted to continue that method of instruction 
but mrs martinez and hanlon insisted that eliana needed to be 
with other children 
in her aug 8 ruling ms kovachevich said she was trying to 
address the concerns of both sides 
even though mrs martinez says she wont send eliana to school 
next week school officials are building an 8000 glass enclosure 
the plumbing is already finished 
when mrs martinez first heard the judges ruling she started to 
cry i was angry and confused she said in an interview last 
week 
i said to myself theres no way im going to do that see 
her behind a cage watching other children and wanting to get out 
and play with them then there was the confusion the fear i 
thought is this the only way were going to be able to do it 
hanlon quoted pediatric and psychological experts as saying the 
classroom restrictions would be harmful to eliana and could put 
even more stress on her weak immune system 
hillsborough school board member and former teacher marion 
rodgers called the booth cruel 
if we did this in any other school setting for any other 
reason the courts would have us there for child abuse she said 
mrs martinez adopted eliana after she responded to a radio 
appeal in puerto rico for a baby living at a hospital 
doctors believe that eliana born prematurely was exposed to 
aids when she had multiple transfusions as an infant 
she has been on the aidsfighting drug azt for the past year and 
her mother says she has improved noticeably over the last several 
months the childs homebound teacher confirms that 
she was deprived of family and we became that she was 
deprived of health and we gave her the best medical attention we 
could mrs martinez says now i dont want her deprived of an 
education she needs more than an hour a week to progress and she 
needs friends

one hundred years after the hatfieldmccoy 
feud ended west virginia is embroiled in a polite debate on the 
propriety of cashing in on the bloodshed 
guides at chief logan state park led threehour tours of feudin 
country during a weeklong festival that ended sunday the show 
included films slide shows music and souvenirs 
this part of the state doesnt have high mountains and 
waterfalls but we do have the most interesting history said 
alvin gale a park ranger who leads the tours its not something 
to be proud of but it is history 
i guess things had to be settled one way or another said 
liz clay 66 who went on one of the tours last week thats 
life honey to know what went on years ago 
at least 14 people died in the feud that pitted the mccoy clan 
of pike county ky against the hatfield clan of logan county 
wva part of which is now mingo county 
no one knows what prompted the bloodshed speculation centers on 
a stolen hog and a romeoandjuliet romance between two members of 
the families whatever set it off it took the intervention of the 
governors of two states to bring peace in 1888 
the tour covers five cemeteries two dilapidated houses one 
battle site and some papaw bushes at the site where three mccoy 
brothers were slain by the hatfields 
only one kentucky cemetery is included and some kentuckians 
have halfjokingly accused the guides of slanting the tour toward 
west virginia state officials say they left out kentucky sites 
because they were too far away 
while many revel in the homespun notoriety some historians 
contend that reviving the hatfieldmccoy feud perpetuates ugly 
stereotypes of appalachians 
to me its very sad for this to be a commercial thing its 
playing on a stereotype which i dont like said altina l 
waller a former history professor at west virginia university 
whose book feud hatfields mccoys and social change in 
appalachia 18601900 recently was published by the university 
of north carolina press 
on the other hand its sort of coming to terms with 
history waller said 
the publicity which pops up frequently in national magazines 
and newspapers may hurt the area more than help it said ron 
eller director of the appalachian center at the university of 
kentucky 
theres probably been few other things in appalachian history 
that have reflected more of the negative stereotype as the 
hatfieldmccoy feud eller said the national imagery is that 
they were backwoods isolated mountain farmers in reality they 
were very important families who competed for land access that 
would lead to economic development 
the tours in west virginia are spurring some interest in pike 
county where the preservation council of pike county wants to 
arrange similar tours sites would include the remnants of the 
house where the stolen hog trial was held the place where a 
hatfield supporter was hanged and the grave of randolph mccoy 
patriarch of the mccoy clan 
since it is an internationally known part of our heritage we 
need to capitalize on it said betsy venters the councils 
president its something that the present generation wants to 
know more about 
pike county judgeexecutive paul patton isnt so sure 
the hatfieldmccoy feud is one thing that most people are 
aware of i guess people hold on to that as one thing that might 
grow into a significant tourist industry he said but it 
certainly might not promote the type of image we want

with the cause of their deaths still shrouded 
in mystery the bodies of ambassador arnold l raphel and brig 
gen herbert m wassom were returned from pakistan on sunday with 
full military honors and tributes from two cabinet members 
as grieving family members watched the flagdraped coffins which 
pallbearers carried past a 19man military cordon secretary of 
state george p shultz called raphel and wassom two of our best 
and said the nation is better and safer because of their 
sacrifice 
as professionals and patriots they were committed to the 
inseparable principles needed for success a readiness to engage 
with others diplomatically to reach agreement and a readiness to 
apply strength in the interests of a safer world shultz said 
the 15minute ceremony at andrews air force base md occurred 
four days after the pakistani c130 aircraft in which they were 
flying crashed 330 miles south of islamabad claiming the lives of 
president mohammed zia ulhaq and 29 others 
shultz delayed a longplanned vacation to travel to islamabad 
for the funeral service saturday for zia perhaps the closest us 
ally in the islamic world 
defense secretary frank carlucci told mourners at the airbase 
outside washington that wassom paid the ultimate price for the 
defense of his country and helped make the world a safer place 
for all of us 
raphel was one of the most experienced us diplomats on 
southwest asian affairs wassom was the senior us defense 
official in pakistan 
state department spokesman charles redman refused to speculate 
on the cause of the crash because investigators including us 
experts flown to pakistan are just beginning their work 
but acting pakistani president ghulam ishaq khan said saturday 
his government suspects sabotage 
judging from the circumstances of the tragedy enemies of 
pakistan are actively posing a threat to the security of our 
country ishaq khan said 
during his 11year rule zia acquired many enemies because of 
his authoritarian rule and there were at least two abortive 
military coups seeking his ouster 
one us official who spoke only on condition that he not be 
identified said a soviettrained and organized afghanistan 
intelligence service has to be among the suspects because of 
its alleged role in carrying out terrorist acts in pakistan 
the official noted zias strong support for afghan rebels 
fighting the prosoviet government in kabul 
the airport ceremony took place in the shadow of the air force 
jet that returned the remains of wassom and raphel both of whom 
had served in pakistan for a little more than a year 
dozens of government officials and family members were on hand 
for the solemn homecoming the first of its kind involving a us 
ambassador since the february 1979 death of the ambassador adolph 
dubs who died in afghanistan 
shultz said raphel and wassom were in the front line of the 
struggle for values that americans hold dear 
arnie and herb went halfway around the world to join the fight 
for these great causes not just for others but for america he 
said if we do not work to shape a world in freedom peace 
prosperity and justice then here at home those principles will be 
endangered and could be lost 
raphels widow nancy ely a former state department official 
walked hand in hand with shultz as they left the plane in addition 
to his parents and a brother raphel 45 also is survived by 
stephanie a 19year old daughter by a previous marriage 
wassom 49 is survived by his wife judy and two children 
tara and doug 
a funeral service will be held monday at fort meyer a nearby 
army post with burial in arlington national cemetery

director martin scorsese says critics of his film 
the last temptation of christ have misinterpreted the scene in 
which jesus imagines making love to mary magdalene 
some conservative christian leaders have denounced the film 
saying it reinterprets the bible thousands of people protested 
when last temptation opened two weeks ago to packed houses in 
seven us cities and two in canada 
scorsese said the films most controversial scene in which a 
crucified jesus hallucinates having sex with mary magdalene should 
not offend viewers when taken in context 
that is the very last temptation of christ to forego his 
divinity and become merely human in the dream christ imagines a 
full human life with a marriage to mary magdalene and a family of 
children scorsese said in an interview published sunday in the 
observer newspaper 
the temptation is not to have sex but to get married make 
love to your wife and have children like an ordinary man he said 
in the film jesus rejects this final temptation

they do really make me mad when they tell me i cant play in 
waco wacos my hometown it gets my red irish hair up nelson

in 
nelson a country singer and movie star who is no stranger to 
trouble said his concert promoter tom gresham was told by baylor 
president herbert reynolds that the concert was canceled this week

who objected to nelsons benefit last year for an american indian 
convicted of killing a federal officer the officers stopped 
picketing after nelson promised to do a benefit for both indian and

the olympic games dont open until next month but 
illustrator bart forbes has already won some artistic gold medals 
the us postal service chose designs submitted by forbes for 
both the 1988 winter and summer olympic commemoratives the summer 
stamp which depicts a male gymnast was issued friday at the us 
olympic training center in colorado springs colo 
in addition forbes whose realistic depictions have graced the 
covers of time sports illustrated and dozens of other magazines 
has been chosen by the korean olympic committee as the official 
artist of the summer games 
forbes 49 was commissioned to finish 12 paintings before he 
leaves for seoul next month he will paint about 20 more for a 
museum that will commemorate the games 
a golfer and sometimetennis player forbes says hes not an 
athlete but his studio in a renovated centuryold twostory 
building in dallas arts district is trimmed with old baseballs 
hats and other sports paraphernalia 
sports is a subject matter i like to do forbes said 
calling the olympics assignment a career highlight its fun 
its exciting and timely 
timely but not dated forbes believes well done art is timeless 
i dont want to get caught doing finishline illustrations 
forbes said of the typical sporting event depiction 
the crux for any painter or illustrator is not being satisfied 
with the first or most obvious solution he said the challenge 
he continued is to portray the human spirit of the games how 
athletes respond to enormous pressure for instance 
many of the athletes train four years for just one shot its 
an incredible event sure there are some who are just glad they 
made it to the olympics but for so many theyre there for only one 
thing a gold medal 
an art graduate of the university of north carolina forbes 
earned an advanced degree at the art center in los angeles unsure 
of his ability to break into the new york design industry forbes 
settled in dallas for several years after school 
later after spending five years in new york forbes returned 
with his family to dallas he said hes lucky to be able to live 
where he wants and work on a national scale 
forbes paints with a simple realism he says is influenced by the 
american artists thomas eakins and winslow homer among others 
the koc commission was something of a coincidence 
when the united states sports academy in mobile ala honored 
forbes as its sports artist of the year in 1987 he shared the 
graduate schools spotlight with korean olympic committee president 
chong ha kim 
a few weeks after that meeting kim told forbes hed been chosen 
the committees official artist and invited him to seoul for a week 
to make preparations 
forbes first 12 paintings based on that visit will be part of 
a calendar the koc will sell during the olympics which begin 
september 17 
in all forbes will create an original work depicting each 
olympic event as well as the opening and closing ceremonies

ethnic clashes in northern burundi last 
week left about 3000 people dead and sent at least 16000 fleeing 
across the border to escape the bloodbath a diplomat said sunday 
the facts are very very sketchy because of the remoteness of 
the area and the nature of the thing itself said the diplomat 
who is based in the tiny central african country and who spoke on 
condition of anonymity but there has been no major violence 
since the first 24 hours 
previous reports said that several thousand people were killed 
but the diplomat was the first official to give a specific figure 
the earlier reports also said that only 7000 burundians fled their 
country 
the fighting began aug 14 between the hutu burundis majority 
tribe and the tutsi the minority tribe that controls the military 
and rules the country 
the majority of the victims were tutsi said the diplomat 
who was reached by telephone in bujumbura the burundi capital 
one media report quoting an anonymous source said 24000 were 
killed but the diplomat called that figure extremely 
exaggerated 
by friday at least 16000 burundians hutu and tutsi had 
fled into neighboring rwanda the diplomat said 
a 7 pm5 am curfew was clamped on burundi meetings of more 
than five people and travel between towns were banned 
the government blamed the trouble on outsiders 
we suspect that some former hutu refugees infiltrated the 
country from from foreign countries they incited the hutu 
population and called on them to massacre the tutsi population 
astere nzisabira burundis ambassador to belgium said last week 
the two tribes are longtime enemies after an abortive coup 
attempt in 1972 in the former belguim colony the tutsis responded 
by massacring 100000 hutu including most of the tribes 
intelligentsia 
burundi with nearly 5 million people crammed into an area about 
the size of maryland is one of africas most densely populated 
countries eightyfour percent of its people are hutu while 15 
percent are tutsis 
in the northern area where last weeks violence occurred the 
hutu account for more than 90 percent of the population 
most of the killings occurred near two communes known as 
marangara and ntega burundi is mostly rural and people reside in 
such communes its mostly hillsides covered with houses the 
diplomat said of the area 
peace was restored to the region within a day after the army 
moved in the government said 
the hutu people liberation party an exiled opposition group 
charged in belgium that the tutsidominated military had massacred 
thousands of hutu but the diplomatic source said there was no 
evidence of that 
ethnic struggles have plagued burundi since independence from 
belguim in 1962 for generations the tall lanky tutsi held the 
short stocky hutu in feudal serfdom 
in 1976 col jeanbaptiste bagaza mounted a bloodless coup that 
ousted michel micombero who had sanctioned the hutu slaughter four 
years earlier bagaza like micombero was a tutsi 
bagaza was overthrown in a bloodless coup sept 4 by maj 
pierre buyoya a tutsi who pledged to resolve ethnic differences

johannesburg south africa the government plans to push ahead 
with tough new measures that would strengthen residential 
segregation despite critics who say the proposals are straight 
out of the darkest ages of apartheid 
members of parliament meet monday in cape town to debate a bill 
aimed at tightening enforcement of the group areas act which 
segregates all neighborhoods by race 
black activists white businessmen and even the progovernment 
newspaper beeld have condemned the measure saying it entrenches 
apartheid and would force the evictions of thousands of blacks 
living peacefully but illegally in whites only areas 
the proposed group areas amendment bill would make it easier to 
confiscate property and to evict and prosecute people living in 
areas not designated for their race group 
it is a wicked wicked bill said robin carlisle of the

judges in new yorks traffic court system are 
pressured to maintain high conviction rates and to give police 
officers special guidance to make successful cases a newspaper 
reported sunday 
the system run by the state department of motor vehicles 
operates in a fashion that is unfair both in face and 
appearance to the average motorist according to an 11month 
investigation conducted by the state bar association and obtained 
by the daily news 
cases are not necessarily decided on the facts but rather on 
a preconceived idea of how many should be guilty said matthew 
jason the former state court of appeals judge who led the inquiry 
among the findings of the study were that administrative law 
judges are pressed to be tough on motorists and to give police 
officers preferential treatment 
the deputy commissioner of the motor vehicles department edward 
sheridan told the newspaper that the bar association report 
completely distorted the record 
bits and pieces of information were put together and they 
leaped to conclusions not supported by the record and not supported 
by a fair and competent review of the system he said 
the bar association report said supervisors pressure judges to 
set higher fines and increase convictions in addition dmv 
officials track the percentage of guilty and innocent verdicts and 
average fines and judges are required to review their monthly 
records with their bosses 
the report also says judges are virtual advocates for the 
police who routinely ask the officers leading questions to help 
them make their cases

oregon will add a section to state death 
certificates next year asking doctors to comment on the role 
tobacco played in the deaths of their patients 
joyce grantworley the state health divisions chief research 
analyst said last week that the 1989 death certificates will ask 
did tobacco use contribute to the death 
doctors will be able to check boxes marked yes no 
probably or unknown 
oregon is the first state in the nation to add such a section to 
its death certificates grantworley said the information will be 
used in ongoing studies of the link between smoking and death 
rates she said 
oregons research began in 1987 and while doctors were 
encouraged to report smokingrelated deaths the state provided no 
reminder on the forms 
in the past the state sent letters to doctors asking about 
tobacco use if lung cancer emphysema bronchitis or heart disease 
were reported on the death certificate without mention of smoking 
we know that cigarette smoking kills said bonny groshong a 
spokeswoman for the american cancer society maybe this will give 
us stronger ammunition to take to the public to convince them 
health division statistics gathered since 1987 from the 
voluntary participation of doctors indicate that tobacco use 
contributed to 70 percent to 82 percent of respiratory disease 
deaths in oregon 
before 1987 smoking was listed on fewer than 5 percent of the 
death certificates that listed the respiratory diseases as the 
cause of death 
researchers say the deaths of about one in seven men and one in 
10 women in oregon were caused by lung cancer or other respiratory 
diseases in 1987 
state health officials hope the statistics eventually will help 
lawmakers and health groups to plan programs to cut the smoking 
rate and identify those at risk for respiratory diseases 
theyll probably find that cigarettes are responsible for a 
tremendous number of deaths in oregon said dr james parosa a 
salem lung specialist 
oregon has one of the highest rates of respiratory disease in 
the nation the states 1987 lung cancer death rate was 597 per 
100000 population 91 percent higher than the estimated national 
rate

employers of technical and other skilled 
workers look to inhouse training programs more than any other 
source for filling their manpower needs according to a survey by 
private trade schools released sunday 
more than 70 percent of the 400 businesses questioned rated 
inhouse training programs as an important source of skilled 
employees according to the survey commissioned by the national 
associations of trade amp technical schools 
sixty percent of the employers listed fouryear colleges and 
universities as important sources of skilled labor followed by 50 
percent who listed private trade schools and 45 percent who cited 
vocational high schools 
twoyear public vocational schools such as community colleges 
were listed by 44 percent of the businesses as an important source 
of skilled labor while union apprenticeship programs were listed by 
only 26 percent of the employers 
the telephone survey was limited to computer programming and 
service companies auto repair shops radio television and 
appliance repair firms and physicians and dentists offices all 
are most likely to hire skilled and technical workers the 
association said 
while 62 percent of the surveyed companies said they have 
graduates of private trade and technical schools on their payrolls 
only 50 percent said they actively recruit them only 14 percent 
said they actually contract with such schools to train workers for 
them 
medical and dental offices said they were most satisfied by the 
performance of trade school graduates followed by radio tv and 
appliance repair shops and computerrelated businesses 
auto repair shops were the least satisfied with only 16 percent 
listing trade school graduates on their payrolls as excellent 
performers auto repair shops tended more than the other employer 
groups to rely most on inhouse training programs 
only 46 percent of the surveyed companies said students 
graduating from private trade schools had a better chance of 
getting a highpaying job than graduates of public vocational 
schools 
in general employers are satisfied with the job we dosaid 
association chairman william carson 
carson said he was concerned that onethird of the respondents 
agreed with a statement that private schools appear more interested 
in making a profit than training students and that many exist only 
to take advantage of federal grants and loans 
obviously some bad publicity from a small percentage of 
schools has hurt our image he said schools are profitable 
because they train well and their graduates get jobs our incentive 
is to make more students succeed because then we succeed the two 
go handinhand

pulitzer prizewinning author william 
styron was awarded the prestigious edward macdowell medal for his 
lifetime achievements sunday but told the audience he wasnt sure 
such honors should be necessary 
are prizes necessary or even desirable the author of 
sophies choice asked the crowd of 800 at the 450acre 
macdowell artists colony shouldnt the satisfaction of ones 
work be sufficient reward 
styron who joins 28 previous medalists including leonard 
bernstein georgia okeeffe alexander calder and john updike 
noted that his american literary ancestors never had to deal with 
the egos and competition involved in prize winning 
no medals for edgar allan poe no medals for nathaniel 
hawthorne no medals for walt whitman no medals no prizes no 
annual publishers award no seal of approval no fellowships or 
grants styron said 
yet styron who won the pulitzer prize in 1967 for the 
confessions of nat turner and the american book award for 
sophies choice said he found the medal one of the purest 
awards for artistic achievement in the united states because it 
was judged by updike norman mailer and other prominent authors 
previous award winners represent the brightest constellation 
of talent that could be assembled in the late half of this 
century styron said 
styron said he is continuing work on a novel about the marine 
corps and on a nonfiction work based on his recent visit to 
nicaragua 
styrons previous works have taken on larger issues such as 
racism and the holocaust but he called the war in nicaragua a 
shameful conflict and said he was shocked there was almost no 
passion or feeling on the part of american writers to try to find a 
solution to it 
the macdowell colony provides private studios to painters 
sculptors musicians and other artists it was founded by the widow 
of edward macdowell a composer who died in 1908

a soviet rocket crashed in northeastern canada 
sunday morning after lighting up the sky from new mexico to 
michigan as it fell out of orbit a defense department spokesman 
said no injuries or damage were reported 
the craft which plummeted to earth at about 1 am edt was 
launched by the soviets on aug 18 to carry a gorizont 
communications satellite into orbit said maj alex mondragon 
spokesman for the north american aerospace defense command and the 
us space command speaking from peterson air force base near 
colorado springs 
he said the rocket was probably an sl12 one of the soviets 
workhorse models 
its not unusual for a rocket body not to stay in orbit he 
said theres nothing to keep it there 
the craft was tracked by officials at the us space 
surveillance center at cheyenne mountain in colorado where about 
7200 space vehicles are constantly being surveilled an average of 
one space vehicle reenters the earths atmosphere each day he said 
mondragon said the rocket had no connection whatsoever to 
the cosmos 1900 an outofcontrol nuclearpowered soviet spy 
satellite that has been falling out of orbit for several months 
cosmos 1900 launched last dec 12 is now expected to reenter 
the earths atmosphere in late september or early october 
mondragon said 
mondragon and pentagon spokesman maj mike stepp provided no 
further details about the crafts condition when it reached the 
earth or the precise location where it came down 
mondragon said it usually takes about 24 hours to pinpoint where 
downed satellites plummet to earth 
the spokesmen said the descending rocket was visible to 
residents of new mexico colorado nebraska and michigan 
i do understand it was pretty spectacular stepp said 
he said the downing of the craft which he referred to as a 
nonnuclear soviet rocket body was expected by us officials 
it was predicted it would come down it came down as predicted 
and it came down where it was predicted he said 
mondragon said officials do not try to recover parts of such 
rocket bodies because 95 percent of them usually burn up upon 
reentry 
that spectacular light show that they provide folks with is 
the rocket body burning up he said 
two other federal agencies questioned earlier sunday about 
reports that a soviet satellite had crashed in the great lakes 
area said they had no direct evidence of such an event 
lt jay butler a coast guard spokesman said his agency had 
heard that members of the public had reported seeing something 
crash in the area of the great lakes but he said the coast guard 
had not recovered debris or even searched for any 
susan hawes a duty officer with the federal aviation 
administration said the faa had not tracked a falling object

troops charged hundreds of demonstrators and 
pushed them out of a central park sunday when the protesters began 
chanting prague prague prague in memory of the sovietled 
invasion of czechoslovakia 20 years ago 
several dozen people some shouting fascists at police 
were taken away but the exact number was not known no injuries 
were reported among the 500 demonstrators and onlookers or the 500 
national guard soldiers and police 
the protest was called by the democratic union an unsanctioned 
political party that soviet officials have denounced as illegal 
about 100 demonstrators staged a second rally later sunday along 
the arbat shopping mall said democratic union member alexander 
chuyev he said police chased them and arrested an unspecified 
number who resisted 
soviet television carried a report on the nightly news program 
vremya showing a relatively quiet scene in prague the 
announcer said few residents of the czechoslovak capital heeded 
calls to demonstrate on the anniversary there was no mention of 
the moscow demonstrations 
but reporters in prague said an estimated 10000 people marched 
through the city shouting freedom and russians go home 
they said the march began after a rally in wenceslas square 
police did not interfere for about 30 minutes but then blocked 
the marchers at least five people were reported detained 
tass the official soviet news agency termed the first 
demonstration in moscow a planned provocative gathering and 
denounced the democratic union as a group of antisocialist 
agitators it said the activists were given a written warning from 
moscow authorities that they were banned from holding a public 
rally 
the crackdown was in keeping with the kremlins steadfast 
defense of the warsaw pact invasion of aug 2021 1968 although 
some soviets have suggested the prague spring reforms crushed 
in czechoslovakia resemble those now being tried in the soviet 
union 
in the first protest busloads of uniformed police and troops 
surrounded the park across from pushkin square and shouted over 
loudspeakers leave the designated area or you will be 
detained the crowd responded by chanting the name of the 
czechoslovak capital 
the wellorganized police action prevented display of any 
banners or placards people who tried to unfurl slogans were seized 
by the troops who grew in force during the lateafternoon action 
to eventually number 500 
those speaking out were grabbed by groups of police soldiers 
plainclothes agents and volunteers and carried roughly to buses 
that were parked around the parks perimeter 
what began at 4 pm as an orderly gathering turned into a melee 
as the soldiers in gray uniforms and berets linked arms and charged 
the crowd to force it out of the park 
the human cordons swept protesters journalists and bystanders 
alike into surrounding streets and bushes several pairs of smashed 
eyeglasses lay on steps and walkways after the demonstrators were 
forced out 
fascists fascists shame on you activists shouted as 
police grabbed those who tried to address the crowd and carried 
them onto waiting buses 
is this what you call glasnost one woman shouted out in 
english referring to soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs campaign 
for more openness and democracy the woman identified herself only 
as an american tourist 
most of the demonstrators returned within a few minutes and 
began chanting prague prague prague and shame on the 
occupiers 
when they refused to disperse more soldiers were summoned and 
the mass of demonstrators was forced onto busy gorky street which 
separates the park area from pushkin square 
this is a nightmare they grabbed me by the hair and threw me 
in the bus olga kazaryan of moscow told reporters after 
convincing the soldiers she had only been a bystander theyre 
fascists 
when a plainclothesman shouted at her and a companion that the 
democratic union was an illegal organization natalya babasyan 
shouted back im not a member of any union but we have a right 
to walk around 
the official tass news agency on friday denounced the prague 
spring reforms as antisocialist activity that attempted to 
tear czechoslovakia away from the socialist community 
tass dismissed comparisons between the liberalization 
orchestrated by thenczechoslovak communist party leader alexander 
dubcek and those now championed by gorbachev the news agency 
called such comparisons the result of western propaganda and 
defended the warsaw pact invasion ago as the correct action of 
concerned friends and neighbors 
but a soviet historian writing for the journal arguments and 
facts noted this month that the reform program crushed by soviet 
tanks 20 years ago had the same aims as gorbachevs effort for 
perestroika or rebuilding 
the foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said at a 
news conference last week that the main difference between the two 
reform movements was 20 years but he held to the standard 
kremlin defense of its action as a necessary move to protect the 
gains of socialist revolution

creek and madison campgrounds also remained closed sunday

farm labor leader cesar chavez ended his 
36day fast at a mass sunday by breaking bread with the children of 
robert kennedy as thousands showed their support for his boycott of 
california table grapes 
today i pass on the fast for life to hundreds of concerned men 
and women throughout north america and the world who have offered 
to share the suffering chavez said in a statement read by his 
son fernando chavez 
an emaciated chavez who according to his doctor lost 33 pounds 
or 19 percent of his body weight was assisted to the mass with his 
arms draped around the necks of two other sons anthony and paul 
chavez 
jesse jackson attended with kennedys widow ethel and both 
appeared shocked at chavezs condition also attending were three 
of mrs kennedys children kerry rory and christopher 
the senator dramatically shared a roman catholic communion that 
ended chavezs first major fast 20 years ago 
jackson began a threeday fast of his own to support the boycott 
called to protest use of certain pesticides on table grapes 
thousands of union supporters including movie stars and 
politicians attended the mass held outdoors under a giant white 
tent in near 100degree heat 
after he sat in a wooden rocker chavez leaned over to his 
96yearold mother who was crying and dabbed her eyes with a 
handkerchief 
chavez 61 kept up the wateronly fast his longest despite 
doctors advice that he was endangering his health he conducted a 
25day fast in 1968 and a 24day fast in 1972 
since he began the fast july 17 the united farm workers union 
president suffered from escalating bouts of nausea vomiting 
dizziness and cramps 
doctors caring for chavez were concerned last week that he 
wouldnt have the strength to sustain the fast until sunday his 
doctors worried about his early dehydration and elevated levels of 
uric acid which can lead to kidney failure 
doctors reported on aug 13 that chavez had consumed all of his 
body fat and that he was beginning to burn muscle tissue 
after the mass chavez was taken from the union compound in this 
community 150 miles north of los angeles to an undisclosed location 
where he will have a liquid diet including light broth and 
noncitrus juices for a week to 10 days said one of his 
physicians dr marion moses 
recovery will be long and slow she said adding that 
chavez a vegetarian began the fast in good health and remained 
mentally sharp throughout 
the mass was chavezs first public appearance since aug 11 
when he ceased attending nightly community meetings 
chavez began this fast to emphasize his demand for a ban on five 
pesticides used on table grapes the union claims the materials 
cause cancer in field workers and pose other serious health risks 
grape growers and grocers blasted chavez and the union for 
unduly frightening consumers about the safety of table grapes in an 
effort to fight a political battle 
chavez raised the pesticide issue in 1986 and called for 
captan dinoseb phosdrin methyl bromide and parathion to be taken 
off the market 
in the early days of this fast chavez held union meetings 
visited with union delegations meditated prayed and went on a 
daily walk 
as his strength waned chavez steadily scaled back his 
activities he spent increasing amounts of time bedridden in a 
small bare room in the unions retirement village and his staff 
entered the room only at his request

chicag0 ap republican presidential nominee george bush said 
sunday he has no hesitancy about keeping dan quayle as his 
running mate and declared hes ready to take the heat on the 
controversy over quayles military service 
ive remained cool in this crisis because ive been there 
before bush told a pool of reporters accompanying him on air 
force two to chicago bush talked to reporters soon after quayle 
returned to washington for meetings with highlevel bush aides on 
his campaign plans 
quayle has come under harsh criticism for using his wealthy 
familys influence to join the national guard rather than be 
drafted at the height of the vietnam war 
i want him out campaigning bush said of quayle saying the 
indiana senator appeals to young people and to women voters 
flying here from a visit to the illinois state fair in 
springfield ill bush emphatically denied there had been any 
consideration given in his campaign organization to asking quayle 
to step aside and said quayle had offered no such withdrawal 
bush said quayle would return to the campaign trail in his own 
right as soon as he can get squared away he hadnt even had a 
chance to get his staff together when the military controversy 
developed 
hes been thrown into a hornets nest but you know ive 
been there the vice president said ive got to take the heat 
i made the decision the buck stops right here 
i have no hesitancy about it 
earlier in the day bush had donned an air national guard cap 
and greeted citizen soldiers while saying quayle had served guard 
with pride and honor 
bush said he could not understand why news organizations are 
raising so many questions about quayle adding i dont see that 
theres an enormous demand from the public to know his high school 
grades 
as for reports that quayle had assistance in joining the guard 
from an employee of his grandfathers newspaper bush said i had 
help from my dad and i expect lloyd bentsen did and michael 
dukakis did is it that unusual that a parent would help his son 
some people burned their draft cards some went to canada 
some in the senate turned in their medals we could damage an 
entire generation here bush commented 
after bush and quayle parted on the campaign trail at cleveland 
the vice president told a crowd at the illinois state fair that 
quayle will be a good advocate of the things we believe 
for the first time since the pair started joint appearances in 
indiana on friday quayle did not comment publicly to the large 
throng of reporters that has been covering the campaign outings in 
indiana and ohio 
on his arrival at an air national guard wing of the springfield 
airport bush jumped out of his limousine and made a point of 
greeting men and women members of a guard unit 
he said the national guard was a very honorable service and 
said that others ought not try to be making something wrong out 
of serving in that way 
bush jumped off a tractordrawn tram on the grounds on the 
fairgrounds and went over to an air national guard exhibit and 
climbed up on a platform he peered into the barrel of an unarmed 
tow antitank missile launcher 
encouraged by people in the crowd bush playfully aimed the 
weapon towards the platform holding the reporters and photographers 
the bush campaign has criticized the aggressive attempt by 
traveling reporters to ferret out quayles motives in joining the 
guard 
in him we have a man 41 years old who did serve in the 
national guard with pride and honor bush said 
hell do well bush said when asked how the senator would 
fare on the campaign trail i dont know that he has to learn 
anything about campaigning hes got to get his act together get 
the schedules going this the controversy hit him out of a clear 
blue sky 
bush said campaign manager jim baker had returned to washington 
along with a lot of our people to help quayle prepare for his 
solo campaign outings 
its a question of where hes going to go how hes going to 
campaign and hell do very very well said bush 
campaign officials said quayle likely would hit the trail 
beginning wednesday although they did not say where he would go 
they did say it was possible quayle would be reunited with bush in 
texas later in the week 
meanwhile press secretary sheila tate sought to minimize 
increasing press scrutiny of the circumstances surrounding quayles 
admission to the university of indiana law school in view of 
quayles mediocre undergraduate grades 
the senator has widely conceded that he did not cut a wide 
academic swath but he did want to go to law school she said 
he may have gotten in because he went down and talked and 
convinced school officials of the seriousness of his purpose 
and his motivation 
sitting at a picnic table while munching on a variety of ethnic 
foods bush laughed off questions about quayles academic record 
dont take a look at my lackluster performance he told 
reporters who hovered nearby i refuse to release my high school 
transcripts because i failed chemistry i dont want anyone to know 
that i want to be a president that chemists can look up to

a plan that led to the establishment of many of 
the nations emergency shelters for homeless people was a major 
mistake and helped swell the ranks of the nations homeless in 
recent years experts said sunday 
the national coalition for the homeless estimates there are 
between 2 million and 3 million homeless people in the united 
states women and children make up about 60 percent 
the homeless should have access to more affordable housing and 
assistance to ease dependency on crowded understaffed shelters 
according to those who participated in a seminar at the annual 
meeting of the society for the study of social problems 
the threetiered plan was a major mistake said anita l 
beaty executive director of atlantas task force for the homeless 
it was much too conservative and allowed for a service 
institution that blames the victim 
the plan was drawn up and embraced nationally by advocacy groups 
for the homeless in recent years it called for providing crisis 
services in emergency shelters helping homeless people 
reestablish their lives and supplying lowincome housing for those 
who can live independently said madeline stoner of the university 
of southern californias school of social work 
but that wont work because many homeless people have turned the 
temporary shelters into a permanent living situation she said 
shelters have not only failed to stem the growth of 
homelessness their existence has served to perpetuate the homeless 
condition by keeping many in a transient state she said 
social workers should move away from shelteroriented services 
and toward serving as many people as possible at a low cost ms 
stoner said recruiting new businesses to improve employment 
chances and strengthening vagrancy and public nuisance laws would 
be a good start she added

talk chicken in this saginaw county town and youre talking 
zehnders of frankenmuth and bavarian inn inc which jointly hold

officials with the two restaurants said they were routinely 
checking whether the elias brothers ads represented trademark or 
copyright infringement 
were not really upset about it said donald d keller 
marketing director for the bavarian inn were not trying to take 
action against big boy or planning any kind of negative move at 
this time but we have a reputation that has taken many years and 
millions of dollars to develop 
there is another side of it though he added were 
terribly flattered weve got that kind of reputation that 
comparing their chicken to ours is a way to show they know we are 
the mark of excellence 
frankenmuth is a very popular stop for chicken dinners 
agreed tony michaels marketing director for warrenbased elias 
brothers big boy is also popular for chicken so were really 
using it as a means of comparison 
michaels also stressed that the ads carry a disclaimer below the

the last emperor opened sunday in the chinese 
capital to packed theaters but moviegoers gave a muted reaction to 
the film about the end of chinas precommunist royal dynasty 
one woman waiting for a bus after the movie said the 
beginning was good very riveting but the last part was too 
serious she also said the scenes of a communist reeducation 
camp were not realistic but did not elaborate she declined to give 
her name 
the film about the life of chinas last emperor henry pu yi 
will have its official beijing premier sept 27 italian director 
bernardo bertolucci the films two producers and john lone who 
played pu yi will be invited to attend 
two beijing theaters on sunday began showing a 10day special 
run 
the chinese audiences often noisy during movies were usually 
quiet 
but scenes of zealous red guards marching alleged 
counterrevolutionaries through the streets during the 196676 
cultural revolution drew chatter and laughter some viewers joined 
in the singing and chanting 
the 49cent ticket price three times the usual cost did not 
seem to affect sales for sundays showings most moviegoers who 
were questioned said they came to see why the film won nine oscars 
including the award for best picture at the academy awards in 
april 
after the showing pretty good and ok were typical 
comments 
a few people said they went to see actress joan chen who played 
the empress chen is a chinese actress who went to the united 
states in 1981 
one man complained that using a foreign actor to depict pu yi 
was hardly fitting 
a college student praised the film as historically accurate and 
said he wanted to see it a second time 
the last emperor which opened in the united states in 
december was to be released in chinese theaters in june but that 
date was postponed the film bureau which must approve all foreign 
films shown in china said the time was needed to dub the film into 
chinese 
but there was speculation that officials might be unhappy with 
the films treatment of communist party history and that cuts were 
being made the bureau denied that 
li zongyue an editor for china film press who has seen both the 
original movie and the chinese version several times said minor 
cuts were made generally of scenes deemed unsuitable for children 
capital theater manager sun guangyin said the responses of 
moviegoers were mixed 
some viewers said they wanted to see last emperor again but 
others said it wasnt nearly as good as a 30part chinese 
television series on pu yi also called the last emperor and 
nationally broadcast earlier this year

the man who bought the lakefront home of 
former ptl television evangelist jim bakker is remodeling the 
685000 house and is hopeful its notoriety will die down 
its just a house and it happens to be a little famous 
robert rubino said of the 10266squarefoot house 
a lot of curious people still stroll down his driveway to look 
at the house that once belonged to bakker who was forced from the 
ministry in a sex and money scandal 
little evidence of the bakkers taste will be left once the 
redecoration is complete rubino said 
for example the goldplated swan bathroom fixtures and the 
green carpet that covers most of the house will be removed and a 
19by22foot closet will be changed into a bedroom 
the fourbedroom fivebathrom home has a 36footlong swimming 
pool a boat dock a marble foyer an exercise room and a music

actress helen hayes was airlifted 
to a hospital in this western colorado city sunday after her 
heartbeat became irregular 
miss hayes 87 was visiting her son actor james macarthur in 
crested butte a rocky mountain resort town about 10000 feet above 
sea level when she began feeling ill a doctor said 
i really feel it was just the altitude that was bothering her 
but she was sent to grand junction to confirm whether or not she 
had a heart attack dr dan tullius told the associated press 
she had an irregular heartbeat and it could be secondary to 
altitude 
we just flew her to grand junction mostly she needed to get 
to a lower altitude and get a test to rule out whether she was 
having a heart attack he said 
the doctor said miss hayes was conscious and not in pain when he 
treated her 
the silverhaired actress ended her theater career in 1971 
after 66 years because of allergies to dust that aggravated her 
chronic asthmatic bronchitis but continued to work before the 
camera and was active in causes including the rights of the aged 
she won a tony two oscars and an emmy and in 1981 received the 
kennedy center honors for lifetime achievement in 1980 she was 
selected as one of 10 american artists to be commemorated on a gold 
medallion issued by the treasury department

president corazon aquino said sunday 
she would not resign but would continue governing this factious 
country because she had a covenant with the filipino people and a 
contract with god 
mrs aquino made no direct reference to the aug 13 demand by 
vice president salvador laurel that she step down and call new 
presidential elections 
but she told about 2000 people at ceremonies marking the fifth 
anniversary of the slaying of her husband opposition leader 
benigno aquino jr that forces bent on destabilizing the 
philippines were working against her 
every step we have taken toward progress has been challenged 
particularly at this time of the year by those determined to see 
this nation fail mrs aquino said 
but you and i shall not let it she added for my 
mandate is with this nation not with its enemies my covenant is 
with the constitution our contract is with god 
she added for my mandate is with this nation not with is 
enemies my covenant is with the constitution our contract is with 
god 
in a letter to the president laurel had accused her 
administration of incompetence and of failing to stem the 19year 
communist rebellion 
laurel offered to resign if mrs aquino did but added that if 
she refused he would remain vice president and join the 
opposition mrs aquino has so far not responded to laurel in 
writing 
last week laurel met with opposition leaders to discuss forming 
a unified opposition party but his call for a new election has 
failed to gain the support of major politicians 
the next presidential election is set for may 1992 
laurel and opposition leaders have charged that the aquino 
administration is rife with corruption they have compared it to 
the final years in office of ousted president ferdinand marcos 
mrs aquino came to power after marcos was toppled by a 
civilianmilitary uprising on feb 25 1986 the revolt culminated 
a wave of public outrage sparked by the aug 21 1983 
assassination of her husband 
he was murdered while leaving a jet under military escort he 
had just flown home after three years selfimposed exile in the 
united states

vice president george bush said sunday hell take the heat 
over the controversy surrounding running mate dan quayles military 
service a flap that one senior republican predicted will linger 
for a while 
democrats claimed it all showed their ticket has more stature 
bush told a pool of reporters as he flew to chicago on air force 
two that quayle has been thrown into a hornets nest but you 
know ive been there ive got to take the heat i made the 
decision the buck stops right here 
the vice president said he had no hesitancy about keeping 
quayle on the ticket despite the controversy over the indiana 
senator using his wealthy familys influence to join the national 
guard during the vietnam war 
after arriving at the springfield ill airport sunday afternoon 
bush hopped out of his limousine and greeted men and women members 
of an air national guard unit 
he said theirs was a very honorable service and that others 
ought not try to be making something wrong out of serving in that 
way 
a little later bush leaped off a tram on the grounds of the 
illinois state fair and walked over to an air national guard 
exhibit peering down the barrel of an unloaded antitank missile 
launcher before playfully turning the weapon on reporters 
craig fuller bushs chief of staff said he and other campaign 
officials are convinced that dan quayle did absolutely nothing 
improper by seeking membership in the national guard during the 
vietnam war 
a day earlier bush himself had called the issue a tempest in 
a teapot 
fuller appearing on the cbs television show face the 
nation said a review of quayles background after questions were 
raised disclosed nothing new 
he said taking quayle off the ticket was never considered 
bush and quayle appeared together in ohio early sunday before 
the vice president went off to the illinois state fair and quayle 
returned to washington for a couple of days of private time to 
chart the course of a campaign born less than a week ago at the 
republican national convention in new orleans 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis taking sunday 
off at home in boston and his running mate sen lloyd bentsen of 
texas was relaxing at his virginia farm 
senate minority leader bob dole of kansas one of those bush 
passed over in his vice presidential selection process said sunday 
he spoke with bush campaign director james baker about the national 
guard flap saturday evening and he believes its pretty much 
behind them 
what does dole think 
i think its going to last awhile replied dole to the 
question put by an interviewer on nbcs meet the press 
questioned about how quayle could be picked over more 
experienced and wellknown senators dole said he thought bush 
decided to go for the generational thing 
the national guard issue might not play well he said right 
now i would guess there are number of reagan democrats who are 
going to remain undecided or maybe go the other way he said 
however he said he believed the bushquayle campaign would 
allay those concerns as time goes on quayle can still be very 
effective because of his expertise on certain issues especially 
defense dole said 
house democratic whip tony coelho of california also appearing 
on the nbc program said the question was not quayles service in 
the national guard but rather bushs judgment in choosing quayle 
as running mate over what he said were better qualified republicans 
out of the 46 republicans in the senate i think most people 
would agree that dan quayle at best is 30th or something like 
that said coelho why did george bush pick dan quayle thats 
got to be the question 
is dan quaylequalified to be president of the united states 
coelho asked i dont think he has the maturity i dont think he 
has had the experience and for sure the one thing that we all look 
at i dont think he has shown the leadership over the years to do 
the job 
although bush made a good speech at the convention the 
question really is whether or not george bush is capable to make 
the decisions when called upon coelho said his first 
presidential decision was dan quayle michael dukakis first 
presidential decision was lloyd bentsen 
dukakis campaign manager susan estrich on face the nation 
echoed coelhos sentiments 
is this the man who is best qualified to be vice president of 
the united states she asked if not she said at that point 
the real issue is not dan quayle its george bush and his 
judgment his decision to pass over some republicans of real 
national stature to choose dan quayle 
meanwhile quayles father told the cleveland plain dealer that 
his son didnt meet the academic requirements for indiana 
university law school but he met the dean and talked his way 
in 
newspaper publisher james c quayle also said that the 
candidates family ties helped him get a job as an investigator for 
indianas attorney general 
the law school admissions dean g kent frandsen was a 
republican city judge in lebanon ind where the quaylepulliam 
family owns the local newspaper 
james quayle told the newspaper that an executive who worked for 
quayles late grandfather eugene c pulliam owner of indianas 
largest newspapers arranged an interview for quayle with theodore 
l sendack then attorney general of the state 
quayle became chief investigator in the attorney generals 
consumer office and later administrative assistant to edgar 
whitcomb then indianas republican governor

officials said most of the deaths occurred in darbhanga munger 
and madhubani districts more than 25000 houses in those areas 
were destroyed they said 
vk sharma a deputy secretary in the bihar government 
predicted the death toll would rise because many people were 
seriously injured 
landslides knocked out communication links on both sides of the 
border preventing officials from obtaining information about 
casualties or damage from the remote hardest hit areas 
the tolls have come in only from urban areas sharma said in 
a telephone interview from patna the bihar capital 
the monsoon rains which hit the subcontinent in late june and 
usually continue through september also were hampering rescue

houses collapsed from the quakes impact but other officials said

and other relief material to the disaster aras indian prime 
minister rajiv gandhi planned to visit the region monday to survey 
the damage 
most of the victims were asleep in their beds when the quake 
struck witnesses said windows and doors rattled buildings cracked 
and people ran screaming from their homes 
my bed rattled then it began swinging said rn rudra a 
resident of patna my dogs began barking and i ran out of the 
house 
the quake also was felt in the heavily populated states of uttar 
pradesh west bengal and orissa united news of india said reports 
of injuries came from the darjeeling district of west bengal the

after the quake shifted embankments and flooded nearly 50 villages 
the united news of india said

was not known whether the deaths were due to floods or collapsing 
houses 
the bhootahi balan river continued to rise more than 12 hours

troops might be sent to help rescue operations the officials said 
the richter scale measures the energy released by an earthquake 
as gauged by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph a quake 
of magnitude 6 is capable of causing severe damage

the retreat of contra rebels and 
supporters to remote honduran base camps threatens the survival of 
the insurgency to oust nicaraguas leftist sandinista government 
the action also reverses months of political and military 
advances 
officials at the rebel camps said more than 14000 contra troops 
and civilians crossed the coco river border in the past four months 
into yamales in the steep honduran mountains rebel officers 
estimate that no more than 2000 fighters remain in the northern

annual meeting at 10 am edt this wednesday 
yet even if directors backing a sale are elected analyst dean 
gulis at the detroit investment firm roney amp co said you go 
back to the basic fundamental issue here and that is he said 
does anyone want to buy the company 
scherers stock is trading around 26 a share sharply higher 
than the 16ashare selling price of a year ago but analysts 
attribute the increase to the boardroom pathos which has put the 
spotlight on the company 
lawrence obstfeld an analyst with commonwealth associates in 
new york said he doubted any purchase offer would approach the 
26ashare level 
i dont see how anybody could pay that much he said 
analysts note that the biggest profits in the pharmaceutical 
industry come from companies that produce new products scherer is 
engaged only in packaging 
i think it is a fine company in and of itself but as a 
possible acquisition for a drug company or chemical company it 
doesnt make sense he said 
mrs fink supported by her brother john s scherer thinks 
this is an opportune time to sell the company because there is no 
guarantee scherers recent record annual sales of 2907 million 
and earnings of 151 million will continue 
john and i watched our father build this company he made our 
mother and their children partners in it nearly 50 years ago 
and i believe he would have heartily endorsed a sale she said 
mrs fink and her brother control about 38 percent of the company 
peter fink scherers president and chief executives officer 
said there have been no offers and stressed that shareholders would 
profit most if the company remained independent he said he is 
trying to prevent the dispute from becoming a distraction for 
scherers 2800 employees 
id rather not refer to them as damage control measures he 
said after last weeks stockholder meeting weve tried to 
contain the diversion to as few people as possible 
some stockholders say the company will be damaged whatever the 
outcome the family dispute which saw mrs fink file for divorce 
weeks after the board rejected her sale proposal 
what we are really witnessing here is the wounding of a unique 
and special company hudson told about 200 people at last weeks 
meeting 
mrs fink says she just wants what is best for stockholders 
four months ago mrs fink rejected a suggestion by some 
directors that the company pay a onetime dividend that would 
benefit her and her brother in return for reducing their voting 
power 
i think thats the kind of deal id try to cut right now 
gulis said

new york states venerable catskill 
mountain resorts once known collectively as the borscht belt 
because of their ethnic flavor and abundance of food are trying to 
update their image 
these days some resorts are trying to be part of the sushi 
belt 
tourism officials distribute brochures in japan praising the 
regions golf courses the tables at the golf clubhouse of the 
concord hotel the regions largest have buffet menus printed in 
both english and japanese 
its just one indication of how times are changing for the 
region whose old ways were popularized in the romantic movie 
dirty dancing 
margo jones doesnt cringe at the mention of borscht the beet 
and cabbage soup popular at the predominantly jewish hotels but 
sullivan countys publicity director quickly steers the 
conversation to a new nickname catskilland 
the name she said is meant to convey the catskills more 
active image as a center for sports and recreation 
i dont think well ever get away from that ethnic image and i 
dont think we want to jones said some of the things we like 
about the image are the sense of tradition a sense of family and a 
warmth that you dont get from a chain hotel 
milton kutsher for example still prowls around the huge resort 
in monticello his family has run since 1907 
nevertheless many of the 500 resorts that once dotted the area 
have folded or converted to other uses about a dozen giants now 
handle the bulk of the visitors 
like many resort areas close to big cities the catskills 
about a twohour ride from new york city began to fade as a 
tourist destination in recent years air travel made other resorts 
both in the united states the caribbean and overseas more 
accessible 
the summertime routine of large meals broken up by an occasional 
game of simon says was also less appealing to newer generations 
of catskills visitors even the hotels nightclubs which gave 
birth to dozens of hollywood careers didnt seem so attractive 
anymore 
it was a case of adapt or die and the catskills did a better 
job than areas like the adirondack mountains in upstate new york 
said dan lee travel industry analyst for the investment firm 
drexel burnham 
to some extent the times are changing back toward the 
catskills lee said you have a rise in dual working couples 
that segment has money but what they dont have is time more 
likely a twocareer couple wants to take three days off and go 
someplace nearby and relax and have a lot of activities there 
thats why catskillands color brochure shows a young couple 
whacking a tennis ball dipping into a swimming pool and hitting a 
golf ball skiiers and other weekend athletes are most welcome 
resort owners continue to use their imaginations to draw guests 
grossingers hosted the first singles only weekend back in 
1962 a concept updated with an 80s twist at the concord resort 
which publishes its own newsletter with personal advertisements 
hotels also have recently sponsored special weekends for single 
parents and for infertile couples jones said 
the catskills crowds also arent as predictable as they used to 
be the families who still come to the catskills for their bar 
mitzvahs now room side by side with corporate executives on 
retreats or training seminars kutsher said 
at west coast travel shows jones said shes known as the golf 
lady among japanese tourists who enjoy the relatively uncrowded 
catskills links 
many of the large hotels are also expanding their services to 
include condominiums offered for use by timesharing vacationers 
while the catskills can claim a revival jones said her office 
had 101000 inquiries from tourists in 1986 compared to 24000 in 
1980 it cant say the comeback is complete 
browns hotel one of the top resorts filed for bankruptcy last 
month although the hotel remains open grossingers once the king 
of the catskills has been closed since 1986 although its new 
owners promise a remodeled resort will debut in 1989 
it hurt us a lot individually because we were friends with 
these people kutsher said of grossingers closing but 
grossingers will rise out of the ashes 
if it does its new owners hope it will typify the new 
catskills the newly named grossingers resort and spa will contain 
some nonkosher restaurants and townhouses said bernie roth the 
resorts general manager

ashland oil inc spends millions of 
dollars to improve education in this country but the companys 
name will be missing from the latest attack on the high school 
dropout problem 
a series of 30second television and radio spots and newspaper 
and magazine ads will be released nationwide this week and be 
identified as publicservice announcements from two notforprofit 
organizations the council for state governments in lexington and 
the advertising council in new york 
ashland donated materials and services for the ads but chose to 
remove its name from them remain anonymous and give credit to the 
two notfor profit groups an action described as unique and 
unprecedented by both councils and the national dropout prevention 
center at clemson university 
it is an excellent public awareness program about the dropout 
crisis in america said dr jay smink the centers executive 
director 
when more parents communities and corporations learn about 
the potential we are losing we are more likely to get them 
involved in projects to keep youngsters in school smink said 
the goal of the campaign to be kicked off monday at a 
lexington news conference is to help reduce government statistics 
showing that 682000 students an average of 3789 daily 
disappeared from their classrooms during the 198586 school year 
the figures staggered us and we decided to expand a program 
that weve had in place about a year said dan lacy ashlands 
vice president for corporate communications 
ashland had previously launched an antidropout campaign in 
kentucky and west virginia using all media to emphasize the 
importance of a high school diploma educators in both states 
reported the campaign had an impact on youngsters who saw the 
advertising 
the idea wasnt new for ashland which has distributed at least 
10 million in the past five years in scholarships and college 
endowments the total does not include money spent in other fields 
of education by ashland 
we approached the advertising council and asked if it 
would be interested in running the program nationally like the 
ones it did on smokey the bear and drinking and driving lacy 
said 
there was one hitch the council must have a nonprofit 
organization as a sponsor lacy explained 
but ashland found one in the council of state governments 
all material that ashland had used in its twostate drive was 
donated to doeanderson advertising of louisville for use in the 
national campaign the agencys services also were donated 
our logo was stripped from the advertisements and replaced 
with that of the two councils said harry wiley ashlands 
director of advertising and communications 
one of two tapes going to television stations depicts a 
depressed youngster sitting in a corner of his garage a few feet 
away an expensive sports car rests on cinder blocks 
the narrator explains that two years ago this car was the 
most important thing in joeys life he spent every spare dime he 
had on it he even quit high school to get a job so he could have 
the hottest ride in town 
today the job is gone the narrator continues the car 
doesnt work anymore and without a high school diploma neither 
does joey 
winners never quit stay in school the ad concludes 
the second tape depicts a teenage mother clutching an infant 
she tells the audience 
making ends meet hasnt been easy with three of us at home 
jobs are pretty scarce around here especially since neither my 
husband nor me finished school 
but its going to be different for this one hes going to 
stay in high school if i have to tie him to his chair sometimes i 
wish someone had done me that way 
the tape ends with this plea stay in school someones future 
could depend on it 
wiley estimated it will cost ashland about 50000 for mailing 
the ads to the media the packages will contain a brief summary 
of how the project came about but this is the only recognition we 
will receive 
john hamby the national dropout prevention centers assistant 
director said there are many many reasons why kids give up on 
education any project that attempts to keep them from becoming a 
statistic has to be a plus 
hamby said studies have shown many girls cite pregnancy and 
marriage as their reasons for abandoning education plans while boys 
tend to blame their dislike for school 
both groups also mention economic reasons hamby said dropout 
rates are higher among singleparent and lowerincome families he 
added 
kentuckys dropout rate has been declining and ashlands 
commercials which began in august 1987 have been a factor said 
dr tony collins director of pupil attendance in the state 
department of education 
in the 198384 school year there were 14224 dropouts in 
kentucky but that number shrank to 9633 for 198687 
those commercials have to get part of the credit collins 
said 
businessmen who saw the ads came up with suggestions to help 
dropouts and kentucky now has more residents going into the 
general education diploma program than in past years collins said 
and for the first time in our history people are passing in 
greater numbers than those who are quitting school he said

agricultural researchers in iowa are 
reporting some success in using seeds pretreated with an 
insecticide to fight european corn borers pests the government 
estimates cost us farmers 400 million a year in damage and 
control expenses 
pretreating seeds with a thiodicarb solution before planting has 
been found as effective in controlling corn borers as any spray now 
on the market yet is more economical and appears to be safer to 
the environment said edwin c berry of the us department of 
agricultures corn insects lab in ankeny 
but the process isnt ready for farm use yet 
berry said the treatment is in its third year of tests and that 
another year of research is planned 
were interested in learning why it is effective in some 
hybrids and not in others he said 
berry also said researchers want to know if the mechanical 
action of mixing the seeds with the chemical solution affects seed 
quality or influences the action of insecticides 
in addition the chemical seed treatment has yet to be approved 
for commercial use by the environmental protection agency and its 
des moines developer gustafson inc says the process is still two 
years away from the marketplace 
researchers also have been experimenting with natural controls 
of corn borers through the interaction of an insect the green 
lacewing and a microbe nosema pyrausta 
the lacewing eats corn borer eggs and larvae and the 
microorganism infects larvae and borer eggs with a disease that is 
fatal to the borer and most other insects but not the lacewing 
according to the usda 
because most insecticides that kill the corn borer indirectly 
kill the microorganism researchers will try next to determine how 
farmers can maintain natural nosema pyrausta populations with 
tilling practices crop management and less pesticide the 
agricultural research service reports 
in the seed treatment seeds are mechanically tumbled in a 
solution of the insecticide thiodicarb before planting 
as the corn grows the chemical is absorbed throughout the 
plants stalks and leaves and the insect feeding on the plant dies 
berry says 
corn borers cause their crop damage in their worm or larvae 
stage before maturing to adult moths there are two to three 
generations to each growing season according to berry 
the larvae enters the plant and causes damage by eating through 
conductive tissues interrupting the flow of nutrients if it 
enters a corn stalk or ear it weakens the plant and makes it 
susceptible to wind damage 
because the insect is on the plants surface for only a short 
period of time before tunneling it is especially difficult to 
combat with a spray says berry 
this is why a systematic or seed treatment is so 
encouraging he says 
thiodicarb already is being used as a corn rootworm insecticide 
that is sprayed just before insect infestation and berry said it 
was routinely evaluated as part of research attempts to find 
materials that are environmentally safer and more effective 
through early tests researchers found the lowest concentrations 
of chemicals that proved effective against corn borers 
depending on the strain of corn we can achieve as good a 
control with seed treatment as with conventional technology and it 
is more economical berry said controlling 70 percent to 80 
percent of the insect population he also said the seed treatment 
puts less pesticide in the environment and has no known side 
effects 
in spraying 80 percent of the insecticide misses the target 
area he said 
ray knake northern regional manager for research and 
development for gustafson said his company is developing the 
chemical for seed treatment use for the international company 
rhonepoulenc which is registering such use of thiodicarb with the 
epa 
he estimated the treatment would cost farmers a couple of 
dollars an acre 
knake said a simple mixer is being developed for farm use so 
that farmers need not come in contact with the chemical while 
treating seeds he says the chemical breaks down so rapidly in the 
soil that it is environmentally safe 
while many details need to be worked out gustafson anticipates 
selling the insecticide for onfarm treatment leaving it up to 
farmers to decide how much of their seed to treat and saving seed 
companies from investing in large stocks of treated seeds knake 
says

armtek corp which has rejected a 550 
million buyout offer from mark iv industries inc says it is 
negotiating with a third party interested in buying the plastics 
and chemicals company 
the announcement friday came one day after mark iv sweetened its 
offer for all of armteks stock to 44 a share from its original 
40ashare bid 
armteks board which rejected mark ivs original share as 
inadequate has not responded to the latest offer 
the company said it informed the securities and exchange 
commission that negotiations with the third party may be 
dependent upon future actions of mark iv industries with respect to 
the amended offer 
armtek earlier said it would consider a thirdparty acquisition 
and in its sec filing the company said it was also considering 
recapitalization proposals 
investors apparently expect bidding for armtek to continue the 
companys stock rose 1 a share to 4650 in new york stock 
exchange trading friday 
armtek is facing four class action suits in delaware where it 
is incorporated from shareholders who charge the companys 
directors are trying to thwart the mark iv takeover attempt and 
havent satisfactorily explored the offer 
one suit claims armteks directors have embarked upon a course 
of action designed to entrench themselves in the management and 
control of armtek and to protect and enhance their personal 
financial benefits at the expense of shareholders 
armtek formerly known as armstrong rubber co is a supplier of 
engineered drive and heat exchange systems modules and components 
and specialty polymers it had 12 billion in sales last year 
two month ago armtek sold its largest unit armstrong tire co 
to the italian tire maker pirelli group for 197 million capping a 
corporate restructuring

iran will repair vital oil facilities 
battered in the war with iraq at maximum speed as soon as the 
united nationsponsored ceasefire proves to be durable oil 
minister golamreza aqazadeh says 
irans official islamic republic news agency monitored in 
nicosia quoted aqazadeh as saying saturday tehran will also go 
ahead with major oil industry projects to boost exports refining 
capacity and exploration and expand its energy industry 
rebuilding its oil industry particularly its seven existing 
refineries which were badly hit is one of tehrans top priorities 
now that the shooting has stopped 
aqazadeh said the iranians want to bolster oil exports as 
quickly as possible to fund the massive task of reconstruction 
before the ceasefire irans government had projected oil 
earnings of around 9 billion for this year but weak oil prices 
were expected to reduce that figure 
iran is currently producing around 23 million barrels of oil a 
day the output quota set by the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries 
its current export level is an estimated 17 million barrels a 
day despite iraqi efforts to choke tehrans economic lifeline 
iraqs powerful air force concentrated much of its bombing 
offensive on irans oil facilities and tankers during the 
8yearold war 
aqazadeh said a new oil loading terminal at gavaneh in the 
northern end of the persian gulf began operations soon after the 
gulf war ceasefire took effect saturday 
aqazadeh said the big refinery at abadan in khuzestan province 
put out of action early in the war will be rebuilt and expanded 
into one of the most sophisticated refineries of its kind 
the refinery with a capacity of 630000 barrels a day was the 
biggest in the world before it was knocked out by the iraqis 
the minister said another major refinery at isfahan was now 
operating at its prewar capacity of around 200000 barrels a day 
after being bombed 15 times during the conflict 
he did not mention the other refineries that were bombed 
earlier this year western experts estimated that irans overall 
refinery capacity of 700000 barrels a day had been reduced by more 
than onethird because of war damage 
that forced the iranians to import unprecedented amounts of 
refined products such as aviation fuel and kerosene from abroad 
aqazadeh said iran will push ahead with plans to build a new oil 
refinery with a capacity of 220000 barrels a day and a 15 
billion petrochemical complex at the western city of arak 
the iranians have also announced plans to build two other 
smaller refineries in tehran and the port of taheri midway down 
the gulf near offshore oil and gas fields
