the drug control strategy president bush will 
present next week will call for 250 million to 260 million in 
economic and military aid for the three principal cocaine producing 
countries colombia peru and bolivia an administration source 
said wednesday 
earlier sources had said that aid figure could hit 300 million 
and national security adviser brent scowcroft indicated tuesday that 
the figure would be even higher than that 
when asked about the reported 300 million figure for the andean 
countries scowcroft said that figure i think you can assume 
has already been increased by the fact that we have given colombia 
65 million to help it fight the total war declared by the 
drug traffickers there 
however the 65 million is coming out of a discretionary fund 
available for fiscal 1989 which ends sept 30 the strategy covers 
fiscal 1990 
scowcroft had not intended to add the 65 million onto next 
years budget said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
president bush met with his top lieutenants in the drug war 
tuesday at his vacation home in kennebunkport maine to discuss the 
strategy but sources said wednesday that the focus of the meeting 
was colombia not the strategy and that no specific decisions were 
made on changing plans for future aid to that country 
the fundamental issues of the strategy kennebunkport did not 
change one of the sources said noting that the final strategy 
had gone to the printer before the meeting took place the source 
declined to be named publicly 
colombia has suffered numerous bombings by drug traffickers since 
colombian president virgilio barco imposed emergency regulations 1 
weeks ago that allow for the immediate resumption of extraditions of 
alleged drug traffickers to the united states for trial 
last friday bush announced the united states would give colombia 
65 million in military equipment such as helicopters in addition 
to some 25 million for protection for the colombian judiciary that 
had been promised previously congress last year set aside 5 
million for such protection colombian justice minister monica de 
greiff asked tuesday for 19 million in aid for judicial protection 
mrs de greiff met for about 40 minutes wednesday with william j 
bennett director of the office of national drug control policy who 
developed the draft strategy said bennett spokesman don hamilton 
she expressed appreciation for what the united states was doing 
and they agreed this was not a problem that was going to be solved 
quickly hamilton said she said that the colombian government 
was in it for the long haul and that she certainly hoped the united 
states would continue its support 
hamilton would not comment on the report that the strategy called 
for a total of some 250 million to 260 million for colombia peru 
and bolivia 
sen joseph r biden jr chairman of the senate judiciary 
committee on wednesday proposed a plan to create debtfordrugs 
swaps to help reduce coca cultivation 
the plan calls for trading debt relief to governments in 
cocaproducing nations in exchange for their commitments to fund 
specific crop substitution and coca eradication programs peru and 
bolivia are the chief cocagrowing countries while colombia is the 
main cocaine trafficking country exporting about 80 percent of the 
worlds cocaine 
the drug strategy meanwhile will urge states to impose tough 
laws against drug users but wont threaten to withhold highway 
funds from those states that fail to do so as the draft strategy 
had proposed an administration source said wednesday 
in addition a proposed 25 million national drug intelligence 
center to be run jointly by the drug enforcement administration and 
the fbi was eliminated from the strategy due to a lastminute bid 
by the treasury department to develop a moneylaundering 
intelligence center and combine all the elements the source said 
the justice department objected to the sudden change of plans 
the new york times quoting white house sources in its thursday 
editions reported that the plan will focus on arresting 
middlelevel figures like pilots couriers and money handlers 
although the government has been trying for years to identify and 
arrest middlelevel workers it has not concentrated resources in 
this area the times said 
the officials said the effort would be a major change from the 
current emphasis on going after the leaders of international drug 
organizations by trying to seize drugs at the border and by 
eradicating coca leaf cultivation 
however most of the elements included in the draft strategy 
the emphasis on targeting drug abusers who fuel the drug traffic 
the hiking of funds for drug treatment by 49 percent and the need 
for massively increased aid to the andean countries remain the 
same as proposed originally by bennett the source said 
in kennebunkport on wednesday the vacation white house press 
office announced that a new program allowing judges to strip student 
loans and other federal benefits from drug offenders starts friday 
the vacationing president bush sent congress a report on 
wednesday spelling out how the penalties will work in both state and 
federal courts 
those convicted of drug trafficking or possession can be denied 
federal grants student loans contracts and professional and 
commercial licenses but not welfare disability or social security 
benefits 
the decision to deny any or all of an individuals benefits rests 
solely with the sentencing judge except for those convicted of a 
third drug trafficking offense for them permanent denial of the 
benefits is mandatory 
the penalties can be applied to convictions occurring after 
friday for offenses occurring on or after nov 18 1988 
next tuesday bush will go on radio and television to describe 
his new national drug strategy that is expected to stiffen penalties 
for individual users

the official press reported thursday that the 
government is taking new steps to reestablish order in an economy 
reeling from speculation and profiteering in scarce materials and 
widespread tax evasion 
the steps include measures to reassert controls over the 
distribution and pricing of raw materials such as coal and steel 
the reports said 
the state will also begin a campaign against what it says is 
rampant tax evasion among chinas 145 million privately owned 
enterprises the china daily reported 
xie mingan an official of the ministry of materials and 
equipment said the state will tighten controls on prices of some 
raw materials such as coal rolled steel and nonferrous metals 
he said redundant middlemen will be eliminated illegal dealers 
and officials trading power for money will be disciplined and state 
supplies of materials to production enterprises will be maintained 
one aspect of the economic reforms decentralization of controls 
over raw materials has led to hoarding speculation and 
pricegouging middlemen often with links to influential party and 
government officials buy up scarce materials at low governmentset 
prices and sell them for huge profits on free markets 
jin xin director of the state tax administration told a 
conference wednesday that if the problem of tax evasion among 
private businessmen goes unsolved it will certainly sap the 
morale of the dominant working classes and bring adverse effects on 
the enthusiasm of intellectuals 
chinas conservative leadership has singled out private 
entrepreneurs as an example of unhealthy disparities in income 
levels many private businessmen some operating from simple street 
stalls earn more in a day than a worker or teacher makes in a 
month a young worker earns about 27 a month 
jin said the state was not trying to add to the financial burdens 
of private businessmen who have been a stimulus in chinas economic 
growth over the past decade 
he also promised no change in the preferential terms on taxation 
for foreign investors in china 
the central committee of the national peoples congress chinas 
parliament was also told wednesday that more than 2800 companies 
lost their business licenses and nearly 800 party and government 
officials were punished after the government began a drive against 
shady business practices in october 
the moves come against the backdrop of a return to marxist 
orthodoxy in the political sphere following the military crackdown 
on the prodemocracy movement in june and a general reassessment of 
the pace of the nations marketoriented economic reforms

a man convicted of the 1977 rape and murder 
of a 61yearold woman was executed wednesday night in virginias 
electric chair 
alton waye 34 was pronounced dead at 1105 pm after receiving 
two 55second jolts of nearly 2500 volts of electricity said 
department of corrections spokesman wayne j farrar 
i would express that what is about to take place is a murder 
waye said in a final statement i dont hate anyone i forgive 
everyone involved 
waye went to the us supreme court earlier wednesday seeking a 
stay of execution but the high court refused by a 72 vote to 
postpone the execution and to consider his case on appeal 
waye a former textile worker also was denied clemency earlier 
wednesday by gov gerald l baliles 
amnesty international has said waye should not be executed 
because he is borderline mentally retarded baliles has received 638 
letters opposing the execution largely due to a letter campaign 
urged by the human rights group 
baliles in letters wednesday to wayes attorneys said he had 
reviewed wayes case and i am not persuaded that the governors 
power of executive clemency should be exercised in this matter 
waye received communion of bread and juice wednesday night from a 
boyhood schoolmate the rev william bell and the revs russ ford 
and ac epps 
john coble operations officer at the state penitentiary said 
waye was baptized tuesday night he said to tell the people i am 
blessed coble said 
hes relying on his religious faith at this time coble said 
hes savoring the time he has with his family wayes mother 
brother two sisters and other relatives visited him wednesday 
waye was the eighth person to die in virginias electric chair 
since the state reinstituted the death penalty in 1977 and the 
117th executed in the united states since the supreme courts 1976 
allowing reinstatement of capital punishment 
earlier wednesday us district judge robert r merhige denied a 
stay of execution based on claims of wayes diminished mental 
capacity monday he denied a stay on claims that the trial jury was 
given faulty instructions 
merhiges rulings were upheld wednesday afternoon by a 
threejudge panel of the 4th us circuit court of appeals which 
heard arguments via conference call said bert rohrer a spokesman 
for attorney general mary sue terry 
wayes attorneys contended the condemned man should be spared the 
death penalty because of new evidence showing he has a very 
seriously damaged brain 
richard h burr a lawyer from the naacp legal and educational 
defense fund in new york told the appeals panel waye was deprived 
of an adequate psyciatric evaluation when he was tried in 1978 he 
also said wayes previous attorneys failed to adequately investigate 
wayes psychiatric condition 
deputy attorney general linwood wells argued that the defense was 
legally barred from raising such objections which should have been 
raised at trial or in earlier appeals 
waye was convicted of the oct 14 1977 rape and murder of 
lavergne b marshall whose nude body was found in a bathtub her 
face was beaten beyond recognition and she had been stabbed 42 
times with a butcher knife the killer had poured laundry bleach on 
the body 
shortly after the killing a man who identified himself as waye 
called police to tell them he had killed a woman according to trial 
testimony police picked up waye at his home and said he led them to 
the farm house where mrs marshall lived alone 
wayes courtappointed attorney william l wellons of victoria 
did not dispute that waye committed the crime however he pleaded 
for a verdict on a lesser charge than capital murder 
waye could be the last person executed in richmond the state 
penitentiary is scheduled to close by june 30 1990 and the 
electric chair will be moved to a new prison in greensville county

the vacation was 14 days old and the 
standings were fish14 president bush0 the presidential patience 
appeared to be wearing thin 
sure he was worried about the drug lords in colombia and the 
civil war in lebanon but the other thing bugging bush as he relaxed 
on the coast of maine was why the heck couldnt he catch a fish 
despite daily excursions in his speedboat fidelity sometimes 
twice daily to ply the ocean off his seaside home the president 
failed to reel one in 
he tried all kinds of lures and a variety of fishing partners 
from grandchildren to visiting dignitaries but still came up with 
an empty line 
he canceled an afternoon of golf sunday in favor of a fishing 
jaunt and on monday morning decided to forgo his 630 am jog to 
try again 
on the advice of longtime fishing buddy bob boilard the president 
even ordered the secret service to keep extraneous boats including 
the small flotilla of press chase boats 500 feet away on the theory 
that the vessels might be scaring off the fish 
still no luck 
bush tried not to show dismay and barbara bush claimed the 
president wasnt bothered a bit but there were signs it was getting 
to be something of a sore subject 
the fishings been lousy he confided to reporters at the end 
of the first fishless week i fish every single day and havent 
got one 
eventually there were inklings of a hemingwayesque obsession as 
he talked of having a rendezvous with bluefish he laid down a 
decree i guarantee there will be fish caught 
when he learned that an 18pounder was caught off one of the tv 
crew boats tailing fidelity he could barely contain his envy 
eighteen pound bluefish he repeated several times out 
there with us theres no justice here thats just not fair 
meanwhile word was spreading fast about the fishless vacation 
the portland press herald came out with a front page graphic 
called fish watch featuring a picture of a circled fish with a line 
drawn across it and the statistics on how many days bush has fished 
without a catch 
when bush piloted his boat into town one day a local fisherman 
gave him a large fish and bush grudgingly agreed with the press 
corps that this seemed the only way he could hook one 
evangelist billy graham bushs weekend house guest told a local 
church congregation the president took him along on a fishing trip 
as a jonah a reference to the biblical figure who was swallowed by 
a whale 
the president laughed and nodded when a reporter asked if he 
would have graham bless his fishing rods 
bush has previously espoused a philosophical viewpoint on 
fishfree vacations saying the fun was more in the fishing than the 
catching 
but this trip the situation seemed a bit much to take 
by monday both the president and his staff were trying to put the 
best face on his bad luck streak 
that morning presidential photographer david valdez caught six 
fish on the presidents boat and national security adviser brent 
scowcroft caught one that he described by extending his hands about 
two feet 
white house spokesman bruce zanca later said diplomatically 
under the presidents careful tutelage the fishing trip was 
successful the fish were caught under his strong leadership 
when reporters came upon him later at the golf course the 
president also took the cheery tack 
we did it today he said 
but when asked if we meant he too had caught a fish he 
quipped i was so busy trying to make general scowcroft feel at 
home there we did well today 
by the time scowcroft finished beating his boss at golf a game 
bush has vowed to improve on this vacation bush was directing all 
questions about golf and fishing to him 
brent they want to talk to you about this im too grumpy 
he said before darting off in his golf cart

the baltimorewashington area are accustomed to getting advice from 
odonna mathews whether they want it or not 
she is the consumers ombudsman advocate and confidante at giant 
foods and whats good for customers turns out to be good too for 
the prospering chain the countrys 12th largest supermarket company 
twenty thousand times a year customers write or call mrs 
mathews to ask for a recipe to request that stores stock an old 
familiar brand or to complain about the checkout clerk who put the 
eggs at the bottom of the bag 
when giant started selling live lobsters two customers asked for 
a merciful way to cook the crustaceans 
mrs mathews consulted animal rights people the national 
aquarium and the fish industry and wrote into a guidebook two 
alternative methods severing the spinal cord or starting out with 
cool water the experts said lobsters feel less pain than when they 
are plunged into boiling water 
on giants commercials mrs mathews brims with advice she tells 
how to combat cholesterol compare costs of different brands or opt 
for healthful snacks choose pretzels plain or fruitfilled 
shredded wheat or matzo 
lower the fat urges a sign over the stores meat counters 
choose chicken remove the skin eat more white meat than dark 
on the shelves green arrows point out foods that are high in 
fiber or low in fat and cholesterol 
three ounces of meat in a serving is really enough mrs mathews 
advises budgetminded shoppers slice the meat thinly and fan it 
out on the plate 
everyone in the washington area can tell you who odonna is 
says lou garcia of the society of consumer affairs professionals 
which represents 1000 firms that employ consumer advisers not 
many of them have her kind of recognition 
the only woman among 22 giant vice presidents mrs mathews says 
she is free to openly disagree with company policies when they are 
not in the consumers best interest 
she pestered giants bakers until they finally agreed to forswear 
highly saturated palm and coconut oils in baked goods except for in 
whipped toppings and shes working on those 
some people think im a pain in the neck she says if i 
am im doing my job 
another idea came from giants consumer board on which customers 
volunteer to serve at their urging she pressed giant to create one 
checkout lane in each store with no candy to tempt kiddies the 
chocolate industry protested in vain she says 
in an interview in giants nothingfancy corporate headquarters 
in a warehouse neighborhood outside washington mrs mathews spells 
out her philosophy 
people are going to eat their hot dogs and their chocolate 
chips but choices should be there consumers have the right to 
choose and they have the right to be informed 
a native of washington she started as an intern to the companys 
first consumer adviser esther peterson who also served as consumer 
adviser to presidents kennedy and carter 
giant was ahead of the curve says guy ford who analyzes 
supermarket stocks for investment corp of norfolk va the 
industry is just coming around to what giants been doing for 
years 
the food marketing institute says a third of 164 retailers who 
took part in a 1987 survey have consumer affairs departments forty 
percent of the consumer advisers report to top management 
analyst kimberly walin of prudential bache notes that what mrs 
mathews does is also good business the costs are not that high 
and the goodwill between giant and the community is great she

two federal agencies contend that a large 
arizona power plant partly owned by another government agency is 
polluting the skies over the grand canyon 
but the operator of the plant one of the nations largest 
coalburning electric facilities criticizes the national park 
service study 
we designed and built the navajo generating station to meet all 
airquality standards said aj jack pfister general manager 
of the salt river project which operates the plant near page ariz 
the plant was located to assure that emissions would blow away 
from the grand canyon he said tuesday 
the controversy pits the environmental protection agency and the 
park service against the federal bureau of reclamation which owns 
243 percent of the plant and would be responsible for much of the 
cost of expensive pollution controls 
costs estimates to control the pollution range from 300 million 
to 1 billion 
the government has tried for years to determine to what extent 
the plant 80 miles from the center of the grand canyon is 
responsible for the layers of haze and pollution that cloud the 
skies during certain times of the year 
the park service defends its 2 million study tracking the 
plants pollution and favors strong curbs but the bureau of 
reclamation sides with plant operators who argue the plant shouldnt 
be singled out for expensive pollution controls 
both agencies are part of the interior department 
interior secretary manual lujan said tuesday he wasnt prepared 
to accept the park service conclusions suggesting the national 
academy of sciences conduct a review that suggestion was widely 
seen as giving the bureau of reclamation the upper hand 
the epa said tuesday that pollution from the 2250megawatt plant 
is a significant contributor to visibility impairment at the 
canyon 
the epa relied heavily on last years sixweek park service 
study in which plant pollutants were traced using a specially 
colored chemical 
the park service said that during the study an average 40 
percent of the pollution could be traced to the plant and that the 
figure reached 70 percent on some days 
we have substantial evidence that the navajo generating station 
is a significant contributor to the visibility problem said f 
henry habicht epa deputy administrator action must be taken now 
to protect the grand canyon 
the epa said it would determine by february how sharp a reduction 
in sulfur dioxide emissions will be required curbs could force the 
plant to install expensive scrubbers or other technology 
pfister said he would go to court to stop any attempt to require 
installation of expensive pollution controls 
the salt river project has put the possible cost as high as 1 
billion although other estimates are in the 300 million to 400 
million range 
about onefourth of the bill could be sent to the government 
because of the bureau of reclamations partial ownership the agency 
uses its electricity to pump water from the colorado river to an 
irrigation project in central arizona 
the plant burns 24000 tons of coal a day and releases an 
estimated 12 tons to 13 tons of sulfur dioxide from its 750foot 
smokestacks hourly 
plant operators contend much of the pollution comes from other 
sources including the los angeles freeways and that a number of 
studies have shown that the plant isnt responsible for the canyons 
visibility problems 
bob yuhnke a lawyer for the environmental defense fund and 
other environmentalists say they fear lujan and the office of 
management and budget will try to pressure epa administrator william 
reilly into seeking only modest emission curbs because of the 
potential cost to the federal government 
in addition to the interior department other owners of the plant 
are the salt river project 22 percent arizona public service co 
14 percent the los angeles department of water and power 21 
percent the nevada power co 11 percent and tucson electric power 
co 8 percent

federal housing officials are refusing to fund 
a project approved over agency officials objections by former 
secretary samuel pierce in his final days on the job a source says 
the department of housing and urban development told one america 
inc early this month it will not honor pierces decision to fund a 
project to develop a computerized listing of black entrepreneurs 
said a hud source who spoke tuesday on the condition of anonymity 
one america a marylandbased company owned by a prominent black 
republican couple had requested 421000 for the project pierce 
approved half of that jan 17 three days before he left hud after 
heading the agency for eight years 
pierces approval came despite a 61 vote against the proposal by 
a hud review committee which questioned the need for the listing 
pierce approved the funding through a technical assistance 
program over which he had authority including the right to overrule 
objections from others in the agency but his action appears at odds 
with sworn congressional testimony that he took no direct role in 
funding decisions 
pierce is scheduled to be the first witness when congressional 
hearings into influencepeddling mismanagement and possible fraud 
at hud during the reagan administration resume sept 15 
hud can halt the project despite pierces approval because the 
department never entered into a contract with one america 
since theres no contract we dont need a reason to kill it 
said the source the one america project had been put on hold by new 
hud secretary jack kemp 
attempts to reach one america officials late tuesday were 
unsuccessful the telephone at the company was not answered 
the company is owned by elaine and howard jenkins during the 
early 1980s mrs jenkins headed a group of black republicans known 
as the council of 100 and also served on a white house commission on 
small business 
jenkins is a former labor department official and was the first 
black to serve on the national labor relations board 
mrs jenkins in an interview with the associated press in july 
said she had not received any special treatment from the agency 
pierce has not returned calls seeking comment 
in a recent interview with the los angeles times pierce said 
that getting more blacks involved in hud programs was one of his 
greatest achievements at the agency but said politics played no part 
in his decisions 
a lot of blacks got business and we certainly didnt ask them 
were they republicans democrat liberal or what pierce said

a prescription that costs 28 in one community 
could sell for 2 in another according to a private survey of drug 
prices that found wide variations nationally and even within 
communities 
the american association of retired persons said tuesday that its 
survey found that prices differed by factors of up to 14to1 
nationally and that costs typically vary by more than 25 percent 
from one pharmacy to another in the same town 
even bigger price differences were found between some brandname 
medications and their generic substitutes which on average cost 
half as much the aarp said 
one pharmacy had the citys highest cost 36 for a brand name 
and the lowest 975 for the generic 
the findings confirm the wisdom of shopping around and are 
especially important for older americans who account for 12 percent 
of the population but use 32 percent of all prescription drugs aarp 
said 
it was possible that an older consumer could save more than 30 
on a single prescription the report said 
for example in one community a prescription for procardia 
heart medication sold for 2699 at one pharmacy and for 5860 at 
another pharmacy in the area 
the findings also have important implications for government and 
private health insurance programs which could hold down spiraling 
costs by making sure beneficiaries get the lowestpriced 
medications aarp said 
the 42state survey also looked at services offered by pharmacies 
and found somewhat higher drug costs at outlets that have special 
programs such as 24hour operations afterhour emergency service 
free delivery patient drug profiles and discounts 
since for many older consumers these services can be as 
important as cost savings and since many offered them at no 
additional cost consumers should ask about the services and any 
associated costs the aarp said 
the group used older volunteers to survey prices at 1050 
pharmacies between september 1987 and september 1988 the resulting 
study which didnt identify specific towns or pharmacies examined 
price differences among 165 communities on 15 drugs often prescribed 
to older americans 
while the pharmacies surveyed were not scientifically selected 
the true range of prices cannot be less than those found in the 
study aarp said 
the report said there were large statetostate differences in 
drug costs with hawaii and alaska having the highest overall 
average prices and florida the lowest but aarp could not 
immediately provide actual figures for the states 
there were big differences within states as well 
in new york for example the price for dyazide a medication for 
high blood pressure and extra fluid in the body varied from 20 to 
45 in six communities in pennsylvania one pharmacy had an average 
price of 1588 for certain drugs surveyed while another had an 
average of 3136 
drugs included in the survey were dyazide procardia slowk and 
its generic potassium chloride tr used to treat the need for more 
potassium hydrodiuril and its generic hydrochlorothiazide for 
high blood pressure and extra fluid in the body isordil and its 
generic isosorbide for chest pain cardizem chest pain lasix 
and its generic furosemide for high blood pressure and extra 
fluid tenormin high blood pressure inderal and its generic 
propranolol for high blood pressure and chest pain and tagamet 
ulcers 
the survey did not include idaho maine nevada oklahoma rhode 
island south dakota utah wyoming or the district of columbia

president bushs new drug strategy is being 
adjusted to focus more us aid on colombia and two other south 
american nations that are fighting cocaine cartels in the region 
the crisis in colombia with seven bombings tuesday in the city 
of medellin was high on the agenda when the president met with top 
cabinet officials at his maine seaside retreat to complete the new 
antidrug strategy to be unveiled next week 
bush promised to cooperate to the best of our ability with 
colombias latest request for 19 million to protect judges from 
drug cartel death squads 
he did not comment specifically on the request but said details 
were being worked out in discussions in washington with a delegation 
of colombian officials headed by justice minister monica de greiff 
because of the crisis there colombia is a new ingredient in 
the overall drug strategy national security adviser brent 
scowcroft told reporters in kennebunkport maine 
in washington mrs de greiff told reporters the law is under 
siege in colombia and we must protect it every way we can 
we must uphold the rule of law and regrettably at this moment 
that requires intensive physical protection of our judges said 
mrs de greiff her countrys eighth justice minister in three years 
the 32yearold lawyer denied reports she had considered 
resigning in the face of death threats against her family saying 
the threats are out there but i am satisfied with my protection 
right now i am determined that the integrity of our justice system 
survives this crisis and i hope to play my full part in assuring 
this 
meanwhile the state department recommended tuesday that 
americans postpone nonessential travel to colombia indefinitely and 
suggested that us citizens living there consider leaving 
although americans have not yet been the target of any 
violence visitors and americans resident in colombia should 
carefully reevaluate whether it is essential that they travel to or 
remain in colombia at this time said the statement the 
department believes it would be prudent for those who deem their 
presence nonessential to seriously consider leaving 
asked about reports that the antidrug proposal will include 300 
million for bolivia peru and colombia scowcroft indicated it will 
contain an andean strategy to help these countries improve drug 
interdiction 
he said the aid package was adjusted upward to include the 65 
million that bush announced last week for the colombian armed forces 
mrs de greiff said the additional 19 million she sought would 
be used to buy armored cars metal detectors and other security 
equipment to protect judges 
the bush administration has already promised 5 million over two 
years to train colombian security guards to protect the judges 
while training and other such programs are useful we also need 
to channel resources into such items as bulletproof cars and metal 
detectors she said 
the defense department said it is ready to airlift military 
equipment to colombia under the 65 million aid package as soon as 
it receives a list of materiel requested by bogota 
the crisis prompted cancellation of todays senate judiciary 
committee hearing on colombia 
sen joseph r biden jr ddel scratched the hearing after the 
justice department expressed fear that publicity would further 
jeopardize the lives of colombian authorities 
justice department spokesman david runkel said the panel was told 
that because of the sensitive nature of the situation in colombia 
at this time that it would not be appropriate to have an open 
hearing 
runkel indicated that a review of emergency extradition decrees 
by the colombian supreme court could delay us efforts to get 
custody of eduardo martinez ramirez who is wanted on 
moneylaundering charges 
but he said we have every hope and expectation of getting 
custody of mr ramirez 
the justice department is seeking to extradite martinez under 
emergency extradition decrees promulgated this month 
extradition papers are being prepared for 12 other colombians 
under federal indictment runkel said so that when someone is 
captured we would be in a position to have everything signed sealed 
and delivered to the united states

the food and drug administration has until oct 
30 to issue rules on tampon labeling aimed at preventing toxic shock 
syndrome a federal judge says 
this delay in issuing a tampon absorbency regulation is wholly 
unreasonable and unacceptable us district judge barrington 
parker said tuesday in issuing the deadline 
the fda he said has been lethargic in responding to its 
legal obligation especially since the government has known about 
the danger for more than seven years 
fda spokesman don mclearn declined to comment on the ruling 
a revised fda proposal issued in june would require tampon makers 
to prominently display one of six new standardized terms for 
absorbency ranging from low to highest 
under the proposal tampon boxes would have to carry labels 
advising women to select the lowest absorbency needed to minimize 
risk of toxic shock syndrome 
toxic shock syndrome or tss is a rare but sometimes fatal 
condition associated with tampon use 
women are unknowingly subjecting themselves to toxic shock 
syndrome simply because government officials drag their feet in 
standardizing tampon absorbency labels parkers opinion said 
the opinion came in a lawsuit filed a year ago by public citizen 
health research group a nonprofit organization to force the fda 
to issue tamponlabeling regulations 
regulations have required a warning about tss since 1982 but 
allow it to appear on a package insert 
the fda has tried since 1981 to have manufacturers label tampons 
with a standardized absorbency rating the agency tried 
unsuccessfully to get tampon makers to voluntarily standardize 
labeling but began regulatory efforts in 1984 
parker said the fdas reasons for delay are lame at best and 
wholly irresponsible at worst

the united states is urging israeli authorities 
to complete an investigation into the death of an arabamerican 
teenager and the disappearance of two other americans 
state department spokesman richard boucher said tuesday the 
united states wants israel to determine who killed a 14yearold 
americanborn youth in the west bank earlier this month 
a report by a scottish pathologist retained by the family of 
amjad jibril tawil said the youth was killed by a single gunshot 
wound amjad was born in denver but lived in the west bank for the 
last four years 
boucher said the state department had been in close touch with 
the youths family as well as with relatives of two other americans 
of palestinian origin who have been reported missing for more than 
10 days in israeliheld territory 
we certainly understand the tragedy of the situation and their 
agony boucher said weve been talking to their families weve 
been following up with the israeli authorities we urge the israeli 
authorities to conduct a full investigation 
the united states also condemned israels expulsion of five 
palestinians on sunday 
the expulsions brought to 60 the number of arabs deported for 
their alleged role in organizing the 20month uprising against 
israeli rule in the west bank and gaza strip 
we deplore these latest deportations boucher said these 
measures corrode the atmosphere within which the peace process must 
be moved forward and make it more difficult for israelis and 
palestinians to engage in constructive dialogue

a havanaborn republican state senator rode heavy 
support from miamis hispanic community tuesday to become the first 
cubanamerican elected to congress winning the seat held by the 
late claude pepper for nearly three decades 
with all precincts reporting in the ethnically divisive race 
state sen ileana roslehtinen 37 received 49638 votes or 53 
percent to 43759 or 47 percent for brooklynborn attorney gerald 
richman 
the 48yearold democrat who is jewish had been making his 
first run for elective office 
the race was made necessary by peppers death may 30 at 88 
pepper a democrat had held the seat since its inception 27 years 
ago 
the 93000plus turnout was nearly 51 percent far higher than 
normal for a special election and higher than election officials 43 
percent projection 
the outcome was delayed more than an hour late tuesday by a dade 
county elections computer problem that temporarily halted 
votecounting higher final counts for both candidates were revised 
early wednesday because of the counting problems 
the unofficial returns indicated that predominantly hispanic 
precincts with turnouts of more than 60 percent boosted ms 
roslehtinen with 80 to 90 percent margins while richman was 
favored by margins of 80 to 90 percent in predominantly black or 
nonlatin white precincts 
in her victory speech ms roslehtinen said she wanted to unify 
and heal the community and provide leadership which is based 
on acaring conscience and conservative convictions 
we do not have the luxury to waste time on divisive politics 
she told cheering supporters at the airport hilton hotel we must 
focus on what we have in common and not ponder on the negative 
richman addressing disappointed supporters at the clarion castle 
hotel in miami beach said we have done incredibly well and we 
did it on a positive theme 
he said ms roslehtinen outspent him and had campaign help from 
president bush vice president dan quayle and sen connie mack 
rfla 
the democrat noting that more hispanics turned out than blacks 
or nonhispanic whites said weve got to get everyone in this 
community to get out and exercise their right to vote if that had 
happened we would have won tonight 
the democrats mindful that august is vacation month for many 
miami residents had tried to build an absenteevote margin for 
richman but election officials said richman had only 3933 absentee 
votes to 3599 for ms roslehtinen 
the victory gave the gop an 118 majority in floridas 
congressional delegation and republican national chairman lee 
atwater called it a republican milestone in the south 
that seat has been a democratic seat since it was created he 
said in a telephone interview from washington for us to win it is 
a major victory 
democratic chairman ron brown who campaigned for richman 
expressed disappointment in a statement issued by his washington 
office but said the democrats ran a surprisingly competitive 
race after an admittedly divisive primary 
ethnicbloc campaigning dominated the short tense race between 
ms roslehtinen and richman for the remaining 14 months of peppers 
term richman had come under fire for declaring this is an 
american seat 
richman had hoped to capitalize on the 30000plus edge that 
democrats mostly blacks jews and retirees hold in registration 
ms roslehtinen looked to the hispanic community which makes up 40 
percentplus of the vote 
polls in the final week of the race had indicated it was too 
close to call 
its been a very controversial election said dade county 
elections supervisor david leahy there has been a tremendous 
amount of media exposure and we think both camps are getting a lot 
more people out to vote 
peppers seat was one of five openings in the us house the 
others were caused by the resignations of tony coelho dcalif and 
jim wright dtexas and the deaths of mickey leland dtexas and 
larkin smith rmiss in plane crashes 
ms roslehtinen had refused to appear with richman during the 
campaign charging his american seat message was bigoted 
however the same charges were made against her campaign over a 
spanishlanguage mailing that urged hispanics to show how american 
they were even though they werent born in brooklyn and didnt speak 
english like richman 
richmans said his american seat remark was an appeal to 
voters to decide on qualifications not birthplace he also said it 
was a response to gop national chairman lee atwaters statement that 
the party wanted to elect a cubanamerican 
but many saw richmans theme as antihispanic code 
ms roslehtinen a legislator for seven years emphasized 
experience and populist appeal in her campaign her campaign 
chairman was the presidents son jeb 
ms roslehtinen whose husband dexter lehtinen is us 
attorney in miami portrayed herself as tough on crime and drugs 
but richman argued that her legislative record against gun 
control showed softness on crime because it allowed criminals easy 
access to guns 
richman also tried to make abortion an issue hes prochoice 
ms roslehtinen is for further restrictions on abortion with polls 
indicating most voters were prochoice ms roslehtinen claimed it 
wasnt an issue 
richman a former florida bar association president stunned the 
democratic establishment by breaking out of a sevencandidate pack 
to win narrowly the partys aug 1 primary then trouncing erstwhile 
frontrunner rosario kennedy in an aug 15 runoff ms roslehtinen 
won the gop nomination in the aug 1 primary 
the district covers black neighborhoods such as liberty city 
most of miami miami beach and miami springs and sections of 
bluecollar hispanic hialeah and upscale coral gables and key 
biscayne

an environmental group says new laws are needed 
to prevent chemical companies from manufacturing highly toxic 
pesticides banned in this country and sending them abroad 
the practice has created a circle of poison where some food 
tainted by the toxic chemicals is imported into the united states 
said sandra marquardt who has followed the issue for the 
environmental group greenpeace 
greenpeace cited the practices of the velsicol chemical corp 
which from its plant in memphis tenn is the worlds only producer 
of the pesticides chlordane and heptachlor 
both pesticides are banned for agricultural use in the united 
states and for virtually all other uses because they were found to 
cause cancer they are also banned or severely restricted in 48 
countries

a federal appeals court says the army may 
subject more than 6500 civilian workers including law enforcement 
and aviation personnel to random drug tests 
the army in 1986 implemented drug testing for more than 9000 of 
its 450000 civilian employees 
in a 30 decision tuesday the us court of appeals said 3700 
civilian police and guards should face mandatory drug tests because 
of the threat to public safety posed by drugimpaired guntoting 
civilian officers 
the 2800 civilians who fly and service the armys airplanes and

the nuclear regulatory commission is urging a 
california utility to decide soon whether to sell or dismantle its 
rancho seco nuclear power plant which voters said last june should 
close 
thomas murley director of the nrcs office of nuclear reactor 
regulation told officials of the sacramento municipal utility 
district on tuesday that uncertainty about the fate of the 
913megawatt plant was making it difficult to plan regulatory 
changes there 
the nrc must approve any transfer of the utility districts 
nuclear license to another operator but it also must approve the 
various regulatory adjustments required if the plant is 
decommissioned and dismantled 
david a boggs general manager of the utility district said 
efforts to sell the 15yearold plant probably will be abandoned if 
no agreement is reached by friday with quadrex corp of campbell 
calif 
the rancho seco station has been closed since june 7 the day 
after utility district residents voted against keeping it running 
it was the first time an operating nuclear power plant was closed by 
voter initiative

farmers are showing further financial gains 
this year with the agriculture department reporting higher net 
income and a growth in farm assets because of rising land values 
those are national figures and dont reflect the farmers who 
arent making it financially because of lingering effects of last 
years drought or burdensome debt they are unable to handle 
even so a preliminary report said tuesday farm asset values 
should rise 4 percent to 6 percent this year to a range of 780 
billion to 790 billion from around 750 billion last year 
rising real estate values are driving this increase the 
report said debt levels will probably be unchanged from last 
year 
cash receipts from larger crops this year are boosting net farm 
income more sharply than had been expected 
nationally it said net farm income could rise more than 10 
percent this year to between 48 billion and 53 billion 1 billion 
more than forecast in july last years net income was around 44 
billion and the record was 47 billion in 1987 
as used by the agency net farm income includes the value of 
agricultural production whether sold or stored on the farm 
allowances for family dwellings and other adjustments minus total 
operating expenses 
in another method of accounting the report said this years net 
cash income could fall from last years record 60 billion net 
cash income does not include changes in inventory values and is 
simply gross cash income during the year minus cash operating 
expenses 
economists said cash receipts from the sale of crops and 
livestock are expected to rise 2 billion to 10 billion this year 
more than offsetting a decline in direct government payments to 
farmers 
total expenses are likely to go up 3 percent to 6 percent about 
onethird of the expected gain can be attributed to larger costs of 
expanded crop acreage this year 
but shortterm interest rates also are going up although 
longterm interest rates are continuing to fall as old debt is paid 
off overall interest expenses are expected to rise by more than 10 
percent this year 
wheat and corn receipts are expected to rise as much as 15 
percent this year following sizable gains last year the report 
said 
vegetable receipts are also expected to rise soybeans 
however probably will see falling receipts as higher domestic 
production and record foreign output lead to a 25 percent decrease 
in prices 
total livestock and poultry receipts should see a modest rise 
but hogs could be the only livestock group facing a drop the report 
said although the decline in 1989 hog receipts is expected to be 
small less than 500 million it will be on top of a 1 billion 
reduction in 1988

the agriculture departments price support for 
soybeans grown this year will be reduced 5 percent to 453 per 
bushel from 477 in 1988 the maximum reduction allowed by law 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said tuesday that was a 
preliminary decision and that the final 1989 soybean support rate 
would be announced by oct 1 
department economists have forecast that soybean prices market 
during the 198990 marketing year beginning sept 1 may average 
475 to 6 per bushel compared with 735 in the current year 
under the pricesupport program farmers can take out usda loans 
and then have the option of repaying them if market prices are 
significantly higher when the loans are due if prices are down 
producers have the option of turning their crop over to the 
government settling the debt 
soybean production is expected to be up sharply this year to an 
estimated 19 billion bushels from 154 billion in 1988 when drought 
reduced yields 
the reduction in the support rate was required by a formula in 
the 1985 farm law supports will be 75 percent of the average of 
season prices received by farmers during the preceding five years 
not counting the high and low years 
but the law says the support cannot be cut more than 5 percent in 
any single year and in no event can be lowered below 450 per 
bushel 
yeutter also said a marketing loan program wont be in effect 
for soybeans this year a marketing loan program would allow 
producers to repay their price support loans at the prevailing world 
market price or at the loan rate whichever is lower

votes or nearly 60 percent to 16102 or 40 percent 
a victory means this community has basically said come on in 
said mary ellen chamberlain coordinator of citizens for 
riverboat gambling in scott county 
it sends a message to developers and the racing and gaming 
commission that we will support riverboat gambling if the commission 
wants it to come here she said i think its an exciting 
concept 
but the rev sam vanderjagt of the newcomb presbyterian church 
in davenport wasnt happy with the result 
were disappointed surely he said we certainly arent 
going to be poor sports about it 
this was an economic moral and social issue they are 
intertwined whether you are talking about theft compulsive 
gambling or prostitution it sends the wrong signal 
in muscatine county voters gave the measure 3939 votes or 54 
percent to 3315 or 46 percent 
the proposal enjoyed wide support in clinton county with 7903 
yes votes and 4929 no votes for a margin of victory of 62 
percent to 38 percent

far in the cold darkness beyond neptune 
a lonely voyager speeds into the void dozens of worlds in its wake 
as it leaves a legacy that may aid the survival of its home planet 
a garden island in a sea of space 
what wonders voyager 2 witnessed as the oneton spacecraft 
cruised the solar system traversing an arcshaped 4billionmile 
path in 12 years as it trekked past four planets and at least 56 
moons 
in 1979 jupiter and its moon io a hellish satellite of 
sulfurspewing volcanoes saturn and its graceful rings in 1981 
five years later uranus knocked on its side by some 
incomprehensible collision and today the probe is 5 million miles 
past deep blue neptune with its frozen volcanic moon triton once 
flooded by seas of icy lava 
such marvels such sights never before seen by human eyes were 
returned to earth in 81000 photographs captured by television 
cameras aboard voyager 2 and its twin voyager 1 which explored 
jupiter and saturn before hurtling toward the stars 
and what one may ask did these humble voyagers these piles of 
1960s electronics do for their human masters for the american 
taxpayers who paid the 865 million to propel them to the outer 
planets 
the immediate benefits of voyagers pictures of neptune and 
triton and their wealth of scientific information is to stimulate 
our intellects and to nourish our souls said bruce murray 
president of the planetary society and former director of the 
national aeronautics and space adminstrations jet propulsion 
laboratory 
but surely over the coming generations those arcane facts will 
become relevant to our destiny on earth just as earlier arcane 
facts from venus and mars are now considered vital to our destiny 
cornell university astronomer carl sagan said if you want to 
understand earth go look at other worlds 
from mariner and the space probe pioneer scientists studied how 
venus thick clouds trap solar heat warming the planet to 900 
degrees in a runaway greenhouse effect it helped alert 
scientists to how industrial air pollutants threaten to warm earth 
flooding coastal areas and triggering droughts and starvation 
sherwood rowland and mario molina first warned of depletion of 
earths ozone layer after using chemical formulas devised to help 
nasa understand venus atmosphere sagan said 
sagan and other planetary scientists developed the theory that 
smoke from nuclear war could plunge earth into a dark cold nuclear 
winter and cause mass starvation of those who survived the exchange 
of warheads 
the idea ultimately evolved from our attempt to understand the 
great martian dust storm of 197172 which was detected by mariner 
9 and chilled mars already cold surface sagan said 
the lesson were learning is that the complexity of the 
universe is something youll never imagine without looking at it 
us geological survey geologist laurence soderblom said tuesday at 
a final news briefing on voyager 2 
at neptune voyager discovered six moons in addition to nereid 
and triton which were first detected from earth it discovered 
three thin rings of debris and two broad rings orbiting the planet 
it found at least six moonlets hidden in one ring 
voyager detected in neptunes bluish atmosphere an earthsize 
swirling storm called the great dark spot 720 mph winds 
photochemical smog invisible ultraviolet auroras and cirrus clouds 
of natural gas casting shadows on clouds far below 
it also revealed two types of ice volcanoes on frosty pinkish 
triton 1000footdeep craters measuring hundreds of miles across 
that once produced oceansize floods of ice flowing like lava and 
volcanoes that may be active today ejecting nitrogen ice 25 miles 
high at speeds of 560 mph 
scientists presented new findings tuesday showing neptunes weak 
tilted magnetic field doesnt go through the center of planet but is 
offset about fourtenths of the way toward the surface that and 
other evidence suggest the liquid that generates the magnetic field 
may exist in a shallow spherical shell not in a deep central core 
as inside the earth 
as exciting as the discoveries at neptune have been this 
encounter has really just been the fourth and final planet that 
voyager has revealed in an unprecedented decade of discovery said 
voyager project scientist edward stone for those of us fortunate 
enough to be involved this has been the journey of a lifetime 
voyager 2 keeps looking back at neptune until oct 2 then like 
voyager 1 it will collect information about particles and magnetic 
fields in space and search for the edge of the solar system sending 
earth information until about 2020 
then carrying copper videodisks of pictures and recorded sounds 
of earth the voyagers will spend billions of years orbiting the 
center of the milky way 
perhaps one day an alien civilization will find one of the 
voyagers and play the record they will hear a simple message 
recorded by a 7yearold boy from another time and another world 
greetings from the children of the planet earth

argentine president carlos menem was quoted in an 
interview today as saying he wants to meet with british prime 
minister margaret thatcher in an attempt to resolve the falkland 
islands dispute that led to a 74day war in 1982 
menem suggested such a meeting could take place during next 
months session of the un general assembly in new york but menem 
in office since july said he would welcome direct talks with mrs 
thatcher in england in argentina or in any part of the world 
the times of london reported 
menem also said in the interview that he ruled out the 
possibility of argentina forcefully trying to recover the falklands 
which it calls the malvinas and has claimed since 1833 their brief 
but bloody south atlantic war cost the lives of nearly 1000 british 
and argentine soldiers 
this is completely ruled out at least during my government 
we will not use weapons to recover what we believe and are 
convinced is ours menem was quoted as saying 
menem added that he would invite mrs thatcher to the argentine 
capital of buenos aires if diplomatic relations between the two 
countries which have been severed since the war were restored the 
paper reported i am planning to do so if mrs thatcher is willing 
to talk to me it quoted him as saying 
the exclusive interview was by times correspondent michael llanos 
in buenos aires but the paper did not say when it was conducted 
there was no immediate reaction from mrs thatchers government 
but the british domestic news agency press association reported 
without attribution the view in whitehall british government 
circles is that if president menems words and proposals are 
accurately represented this is an attitude which britain welcomes 
however while his words will be studied closely in mrs 
thatchers downing street office the feeling is that any 
britishargentine dialogue should move forward one step at a time 
representatives of the two governments agreed during three days 
of talks in new york this month to hold a meeting of officials oct 
1718 in the spanish capital of madrid to discuss proposed 
normalization of relations between the two nations 
similar talks in bern switzerland in july 1984 broke off over 
the issue of sovereignty with britain refusing to discuss 
sovereignty of the islands and argentina insisting it stay on the 
agenda 
mrs thatchers government has consistently refused to discuss 
sovereignty but menem has dropped the insistence of the previous 
argentine government headed by president raul alfonsin that 
argentinas sovereignty claim must be the first issue considered in 
normalization talks 
argentina invaded the falklands 325 miles off its southeast coast 
in april 1982 but britain sent a task force and recaptured them in a 
war that eventually led the argentine junta which had ruled harshly 
for nearly eight years to relinquish power upon the election of 
alfonsin 
argentina claims the windswept islands as an inheritance from the 
days of spanish colonial rule and says the british who have ruled 
them as a colony since 1833 stole the islands 
argentina has never formally declared an end to hostilities with 
britain since the 1982 war 
asked in the interview in the times if he thought island 
sovereignty would be negotiated at any stage during his sixyear 
term menem was quoted as saying it might but it might not we 
have waited 156 years to recover the islands we can certainly 
wait a bit longer 
nearly 2000 staunchly probritish falkland islanders are 
fiercely opposed to argentina ever gaining sovereignty 
menem was quoted in the interview as saying that if full 
diplomatic relations between britain and argentina were restored 
his government would allow airline flights and shipping services 
between argentina and britain and argentina and the falklands 
he was quoted as saying that this included the indiana i the 
falklands own merchant vessel that caused a stir in recent months 
by docking in neighboring ports in uruguay and chile

us rep barney frank says will not talk about 
running for a sixth congressional term until he has cleared the air 
of the controversy caused by a male prostitute he once employed 
when it was reported that frank had paid steve gobie for sex and 
then hired him to do household chores the massachusetts democrat 
said he did not believe the controversy should affect his political 
plans 
but gobie has continued to allege that he procured sex partners 
for frank and that frank knew gobie was running a prostitution ring 
out of franks washington dc home charges the congressman 
strongly denies 
before i have disposed of those charges its not fair for me 
to be saying hey im gonna run anyway frank said in an 
interview tuesday im not going to talk about running again until 
i can get the forum to clear those up 
the proper forum frank said is the house ethics committee on 
monday he asked chairman julian c dixon dcalif to investigate 
gobies allegations to ensure that the public record is clear 
frank has been reelected since disclosing his homosexuality but 
after the disclosure that he paid for sex some republican leaders 
called for his resignation 
if everything gobie said was true i should resign frank 
said the focus should not be on my political career it should be 
on the accuracy of these charges 
gobie reportedly is looking for possible book and movie deals he 
said he has received hundreds of messages on his telephone answering 
machine since his story appeared friday in the washington times 
just leave a message on my answering machine if you can find 
room on the tape an early version of gobies message said 
im an open person ill listen to all offers he told the 
boston herald 
gobie who will be 33 years old on monday has said that he was 
inspired to publicize his story by the television movie mayflower 
madam about sydney biddle barrows the new york city madam who 
ran a highclass brothel 
he told the washington post that he was motivated by money and 
notoriety frank said he believes greed is leading gobie to 
embellish his story 
there seems to be some change in the story and it seems 
someone told him that the more lurid the story the more money there 
will be for him frank said 
frank has said he employed gobie who has a history of 
involvement with male prostitution and drugs with hopes of 
reforming him 
gobies number was published in the city paper washingtons 
weekly arts and entertainment guide in an advertisement that 
offered total pleasure full body massage will make you feel it 
young handsome masseur avail by appt 
callers were greeted with background music of the 60s rock hit 
light my fire 
gobie did not return a message left on his machine tuesday and 
his outgoing message was toned down i will return your call as 
soon as possible or one of my associates will return your call as 
soon as possible 
the congressman said herb moses the man he currently lives with 
has been helping him through the ordeal of disclosure 
he has made such an enormous difference in my life that this 
has been a tolerable experience frank told the boston globe i 
only wish i met him five years earlier he has provided emotional 
and intellectual support that make a big difference the absence of 
which contributed to the extent to which i was stupid personally 
earlier

a flightless bird the size of a boston 
marathoner gave authorities a good run and kicked an animal control 
officer before police surrounded him and ended his twohour escapade 
the bird a relative of the ostrich fled in terror tuesday after 
he was accidentally freed from his owners back yard 
the owners sons and police chased the emu named peewee through 
streets in this seaside town southeast of boston until police 
finally surrounded him with a wire fence in a pasture 
peewee was taken to tufts new england veterinary medical center 
in north grafton and given three stitches for a cut in the neck the 
bird was expected to go home today 
emus are flightless australian birds with long legs and huge 
threetoed feet owner myrin borysenko estimated peewee to be more 
than 6 feet tall 
borysenko said he got the bird as a chick three years ago he 
said peewee was friendly but not very smart 
once hes outside the back yard he has no point of reference 
if im in the yard he will recognize me but if hes outside the 
yard he gets spooked said borysenko who is a doctor of 
immunology and anatomy 
he said a neighborhood child probably opened the backyard gate 
letting peewee loose 
andrei borysenko and his brother justin went to the front yard 
to collect the bird but peewee became terrified and took off 
as my son likes to say as soon as he got out his turbo kicked 
in and he was flying down the street broysenko said 
at the town common animal control officer lesley cook got a 
noose around peewee but he leapt away and kicked her in the leg 
his kick was about as hard as my horse could do but i wasnt 
hurt she said 
after police surrounded him animal rescuers took the bird to the 
medical center in a van but borysenko said his troubles arent over 
now all i have to do is figure out how to get him home he 
said i guess ill have to get a van

highway commissioners dropped plans to print 
the friendship state on texas license plates and said they were 
at a loss for words following complaints that the slogan wasnt 
tough enough 
commission chairman robert dedman said tuesday that he hoped a 
consensus could be reached on a positive slogan that would temper 
outsiders views of texans 
we should do everything to say yall come to visitors to the 
state and yall come in bringing hitech and other jobs he said 
responding to an outpouring of criticism about the earlier 
decision to use the friendship state dedman said perhaps 
never give up should be the new slogan 
as it is texas plates next spring will remain sloganless 
although more colorful with the red white and blue state flag 
on july 19 the threemember commission approved with little 
fanfare putting the friendship state on the states 27 million 
license plates hoping the cheery message would attract tourists 
friendship is the official state motto and the word texas 
derives from the spanish pronunciation of an indian word meaning 
friends 
but once word of the decision reached the public thousands of 
texans prouder of their independence than their friendliness 
jammed telephone lines to the highway department and radio callin 
shows 
most said the slogan was too generic and bland 
state treasurer ann richards a candidate for the democratic 
nomination for governor called it wimpy republican 
gubernatorial candidate jack rains said it looked a little quiche 
and chablis 
the most popular alternative was the lone star state 
although some suggested more topical slogans such as texas the 
insolvent state or the bank failure state 
dedman said there is a feeling outside the state particularly in 
the north and east that texas has gotten what it deserved in the 
states financial and energy collapse during the 1970s arab oil 
embargo some texans rode around with bumper stickers directed at 
yankees saying let them freeze in the dark 
we should be collectively as a group of people as conscious as 
we can be of being good marketers to the rest of the nation and try 
to do whatever we can to overcome some of that perceived negative 
outlook toward texas dedman said

amnesty international said today that it has 
appealed to the chinese government to stop using judicial 
killing as a way to suppress internal opposition 
the human rights organization said it sent a telex message to 
premier li peng saying it feared the brutal crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators in beijing last june reflected an 
official policy of crushing peaceful opposition at any cost 
amnesty international did not release a text of its message to 
li however the organization said it appealed for the release of 
all prisoners of conscience and for fair trials for all those 
facing political charges 
the londonbased organization which opposes capital punishment 
in all countries also called for an end to executions 
in a report published today amnesty international estimated at 
least 1000 people were killed when security forces moved against 
the demonstrators in tiananmen square and elsewhere in beijing from 
june 39 and that at least 300 more people were killed in chengdu 
southern china 
the government has said at least 200 died during the unrest 
the statement also said there was strong evidence that the 
authorities had taken a deliberate decision after the army massacres 
in early june to carry out secret executions but also to publicize 
certain death sentences in order to cow political opposition 
some detainees are reported to have been severely beaten by 
police or soldiers and it is feared that detainees may still be put 
under strong pressure including the use of illtreatment and 
torture to confess to crimes or to denounce others involved in the 
protests 
amnesty international said it expressed concern to li about a 
directive reportedly approved by the communist partys central 
committee in june which specifically directed that the number of 
persons executed or imprisoned were not to be made public 
the report said amnesty international had been unable to confirm 
reports of mass executions 
the atmosphere of terror following the military crackdown 
which has seen a continuing wave of repression including mass 
arbitrary arrests summary trial and executions has made it 
impossible for amnesty international to discover the true death 
toll the report said 
it asked however that china stop using judicial killing as a 
political tool to suppress the opposition 
about 4000 people have been officially reported arrested 
amnesty said it believes the number is much higher and that many 
detainees may be prisoners of conscience held solely for the 
nonviolent exercise of their fundamental rights 
in its message to premier li amnesty said it inquired 
specifically about wang dan a 24yearold beijing university 
student who was at the top of a list of wanted student leaders 
published june 13 
amnesty cited reports that wang was badly beaten following his 
arrest and included claims by a former policeman that the student 
leader was executed

lutherans grappled with the issue of 
abortion in an assembly that briefly adopted a resolution some 
considered prochoice before delegates reconsidered and maintained a 
neutral position 
as the evangelical lutheran church in americas first legislative 
assembly neared its close today it recognized that society was in a 
time of crisis about abortion with mounting hysteria fear 
polarization and violence 
the newly merged 53millionmember denomination settled on a 
resolution tuesday that advised information counseling and 
competent christian guidance on abortion this should be based 
in the lutheran traditions of biblical grounding and social and 
individual responsibility the resolution said 
the delegates avoided defining a position about abortion itself 
leaving that for a twoyear study on sexuality and decision by the 
next assembly in 1991 
one delegate guy erwin of new haven conn unsuccessfully 
sought a speeded up process for developing a stand on this 
excruciating sensitive issue adding we must begin to lead 
or be led 
the assembly reconsidered and rejected an orginally approved 
measure that many delegates interpreted as prochoice 
the rev paul hinlicky of delhi ny exclaimed during the 
debate i will not obey this call for free access to abortion on 
demand 
a nurse betty jane reisner of whitehall pa pleaded for 
retaining the original saying prochoice allows prolife the 
reverse is not true to not permit it is taking away our 
freedom 
in the end delegates reinstated a revised version eliminating a 
phrase calling for provision of free access to services 
bishop herbert w chilstrom church president said that if the 
original was taken literally it would be contrary to previous church 
statements 
the three denominations that merged into the new body had taken 
varying positions one seeing human life as beginning at conception 
another less definite about it but both upholding the sanctity of 
unborn life 
on another topic the assembly urged loving care and 
compassion toward aids sufferers saying they often have been 
met with apathy indifference or even antagonism and denial 
the church affirmed the rights and dignity of all persons 
living with aids and pledged to include them in the life and 
worship of the church 
steps also were taken for fuller inclusion of youngsters in 
future assemblies and to provide resources to meet needs of the 
deaf and other disabled and also those whose primary language is 
not english

supporters of the proposed 500 million two forks 
dam reacted with anger after a fivemonth federal review condemned 
the water project as unnecessary and environmentally damaging 
lee dehihns an environmental protection agency deputy regional 
administrator from atlanta who conducted the review announced 
tuesday that he was recommending the epa press on with efforts to 
kill the project 
denvers water board said in a statement that the decision was 
a classical example of epa bureaucratic arrogance that shows a 
full disregard for the competency and expertise of a host of 
federal state and local agencies that supported the plan 
you simply cant leave us high and dry mayor federico pena 
told reporters tuesday in reaction to dehihns announcement we 
have not been given a fair objective appraisal of this project 
the 615foothigh dam to be built 25 miles southwest of denver 
near the confluence of the south platte river and its north fork 
would flood 30 miles of scenic river valley and canyon and the town 
of deckers which has fewer than 100 residents 
the two forks dam and reservoir project would result in the 
loss of a major aquatic resource which provides irreplaceable stream 
fishery habitat and recreational resources near the denver 
metropolitan area dehihns said 
peter aa berle national audubon society president said 
dehihns deserves the heartfelt praise and gratitude of all 
concerned americans for his balanced review 
his finding that epa should proceed with a veto of this project 
is a major victory in the continuing battle to protect the world 
class wildlife habitat downstream on the platte river in central 
nebraska as well as colorados magnificent cheesman canyon berle 
said 
dehihns said he was recommending continuation of a veto process 
started march 24 by epa administrator william reilly the next step 
is two months of hearings the final decision will be made at epa 
headquarters in washington 
dehihns said vetoes are rarely overturned and that about 7000 
pieces of mail his office received about two forks ran about 101 
against the project 
in response to criticism by the mayor and water board dehihns 
said im not happy theyre upset but im obliged to carry out my 
responsibilities under the law 
denver area water providers contending new water resources are 
needed for a growing metropolitan area already have spent 40 
million in research and planning for two forks 
dehihns said metropolitan denver appears to have adequate water 
supplies for now he suggested denver could put more water 
conservation measures in place before 
epa officials said dehihns could have let project proceed or 
attach additional environmental requirements his report said two 
forks dam and reservoir was the most environmentally damaging of 
the alternatives examined 
besides flooding a prized trout stream two forks would eliminate 
about 300 acres of wetlands and it would alter the river channel 
with possible effects on threatened and endangered species 
downstream including in nebraska where officials have been 
strongly opposed to the project 
i caution that there are still powerful forces aligned against 
us sen jim exon dneb said in a statement 
sen bill armstrong rcolo called the decision a major setback 
this decision was made by unelected officials applying 
subjective standards to a project coloradans have studied decided 
upon and funded he said

afternoon and probably died of asphyxiation said geary county 
sheriff bill deppish 
his 10yearold friend travis enders was buried up to his head 
he was treated at a hospital and released 
deppish said travis reported the pair had been buried for a 
little more than two hours before other youngsters heard his shouts 
for help 
the accident occurred along an 8footdeep drainage ditch near 
the republican river behind the trailer court where the boys lived 
because of the recent rains down there it was probably a 
little more unstable than normal deppish said the top just

alabama is banning hazardous waste 
shipments from 22 states and the district of columbia to keep the 
state from becoming the waste dump of the nation gov guy hunt 
said 
a representative of the hazardous waste industry said his group 
plans to challenge the ban the second of its type in the country 
in court 
on tuesday the alabama department of environmental management 
identified states that would be affected by a law enacted in may it 
bars states from sending hazardous waste to alabama if they dont 
have some means of disposal within their own borders or if they 
dont have a cooperative agreement with alabama 
the intent of this legislation was to force states to accept 
responsibility for the hazardous waste they generate in the past 
it has seemed alabama was the path of least responsibility said 
sue robertson chief of the departments land division 
alabamas ban is similar to one enacted earlier this year by 
south carolina 
tucker eskew an aide to south carolina gov carroll campbell 
applauded the move and said the two states are aiming for a 
regional approach which ensures reciprocity and fair burden 
sharing in waste disposal 
richard fortuna executive director of the hazardous waste 
treatment council in washington said the lobbying group has made 
overturning the two states laws a top priority he said the state 
laws violate federal interstate commerce statutes and will cause a 
shortage of hazardous waste sites nationally 
it is virtually certain we will challenge one the only 
question is whether we will challenge both he said 
mrs robertson said alabamas ban would affect only the hazardous 
waste landfill at emelle the nations largest the law leaves it up 
to the landfill operator chemical waste management to stop 
shipments from the banned states she said 
chemical waste spokesman chris grimshawe said the company is 
studying the list of states and will decide later whether to take 
legal action 
according to figures compiled by state environmental officials 
alabama ranks fourth in the amount of hazardous waste it collects 
from other states and second in net intake which deducts waste 
shipped out of the state indiana ranks first in both categories 
mrs robertson predicted the ban could reduce emelles waste by 
50000 to 100000 tons for the rest of the year without the ban 
the department had predicted that the landfill would receive 700000 
tons of waste this year up from 550000 tons last year 
officials from alabama and seven other southeastern states will 
meet thursday in atlanta to discuss ways to dispose of hazardous 
wastes over the next 20 years mrs robertson said the ban could 
be used as a negotiating tool to get the other states to handle 
their share of waste 
south carolina is the only other southeast state with a hazardous 
waste landfill 
eighteen of the banned states and the district of columbia have 
no disposal facilities they are alaska arizona delaware florida 
iowa kansas maine mississippi missouri new hampshire new 
mexico north carolina north dakota south dakota vermont 
virginia west virginia and wyoming 
idaho montana oregon and washington were banned because they 
did not respond to the states request for information about 
hazardous waste disposal within their borders

justice minister monica de greiff who 
drug traffickers want dead summed up the dangers of her job after 
taking office six weeks ago if they want to kill you they will 
with or without escort 
at the time it was merely a realistic statement by a woman who at 
32 holds one of the most dangerous government posts in the world 
then she became a target in an anonymous phone call from a man 
who said you will be the next 
since 1984 her ministry has been a post few covet in that year 
drug traffickers murdered justice minister rodrigo lara bonilla 
then a former justice minister enrique parejo gonzalez was 
wounded in budapest hungary where the government had sent him as 
ambassador because traffickers had threatened his life 
mrs de greiff was threatened thursday according to press 
reports and hours later she boarded a plane for washington three 
days before her original schedule amid rumors she had resigned 
the reasons for her rush to confer with us officials may help 
mrs de greiff meet one of her goals as a minister to obtain money 
to pay for protection for colombia judges threatened by drug barons 
the traffickers have vowed to kill 10 judges for every drug lord 
extradited to the united states 
as justice minister mrs de greiff is a member of a committee 
deciding on extraditions 
people should not be afraid of carrying out their duties she 
said in a colombian radio interview three weeks ago 
she told reporters in washington earlier this week that she did 
not intend to quit and that she was asking the bush administration 
for 19 million to build a security system to protect judges and 
high officials in her ministry 
the administration approved 65 million in emergency aid earlier 
this month for colombias war on drugs 
mrs de greiff has made it clear that being a cabinet minister is 
the high point for her career as a lawyer i got this job because 
i have experience she said recently 
she graduated in 1980 from the exclusive bogota university of the 
rosary a roman catholic institution 
after working for a few months with her father also a lawyer 
she worked for other private firms developing administrative 
experience 
mrs de greiff entered government service in 1986 when virgilio 
barco became president her career began at the urban development 
office of bogota she later was appointed general secretary of the 
energy ministry 
she became justice minister on july 16 and took an immediate 
dislike to the tight security surrounding her and her husband 
miguel paley an argentine public relations consultant and their 
3yearold son 
with all those armed guys protecting you one must avoid going 
out but that is part of the price being in the post she said 
i love my family but i have less and less time with them 
she added i hope this situation will improve soon 
it did not and when death squads killed leading presidential 
hopeful luis carlos galan aug 18 mrs de greiff became involved in 
an allout government offensive against drug traffickers 
as the government conducted raids across the nation arresting 
suspected drug dealers and confiscating millions of dollars in 
property said i am not prepared for times of war like these 
the statement was considered untimely and rumors that she 
planned to resign became common in bogota 
she said tuesday in washington the threats are out there but 
i am satisfied with my protection right now i am determined that 
the integrity of our justice system survives this crisis and i hope 
to play my full part in assuring this

to the violence 
thats not going to bring my son back said lucille williams 
sobbing as other family members cried by her side i dont want 
nobody else killed one is enough 
lets pull together and love each other she said 
williams was shot sunday after he apparently threatened officer 
paul letizia with a steel rod police chief joseph cassisi said 
williams who was wanted on drug and weapon charges was spotted 
by officers after police received an anonymous call about a man on a 
bicycle carrying drugs cassisi said 
after being told he was under arrest williams picked up the rod 
and approached letizia swinging cassisi said letizia who is 
white fired two shots hitting williams both times 
the state attorney generals office has taken over the 
investigation of the shooting 
letizia has been taken off street duty and placed on special 
assignment city officials said 
samuel clark president of the local chapter of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people met with mayor 
harry curley on tuesday earlier clark called for cassisis 
resignation saying the police chief mishandled the matter by 
calling the shooting a justifiable homicide before a complete 
investigation 
that was the catalyst clark said that sparked the anger

so few students were killed during last 
years prodemocracy uprising in burma that they werent worth 
mentioning the countrys health and education minister said 
dr pe thein addressing a rangoon meeting tuesday of scholars 
just back from education overseas said students must see the 
truth behind last years incidents a transcript of his remarks 
reported in an official radio rangoon broadcast was seen today in 
bangkok 
diplomats dissidents and international human rights groups 
estimate several thousand people were killed last year in a series 
of army clampdowns on studentled unrest from march to september 
according to witness accounts and independent reports scores of 
students were among those killed as troops fired indiscriminately 
into crowds of peaceful demonstrators 
i dont mean to say that there were no casualties only that 
there were few casualties of which students constitute so small a 
number as to be not worth mentioning pe thein said 
the military government admitted killing hundreds as it crushed 
dissent in september but it said most were looters or 
destructive unscrupulous elements 
last june all schools and universities throughout the country 
were closed because of the unrest though primary and middle schools 
recently reopened university and high schools remain closed 
the minister said the country needed technocrats and 
intellectuals to reconstruct the nation but school teachers 
must guide their students to becoming clever people and to 
avoid taking part in destructive acts 
pe thein told the scholars that attempts were being made to try 
to divide the army and the people in burma 
he accused foreign broadcasting stations of using human rights 
issues to portray themselves as the only ones who love the country 
and report that the defense forces do not love the nation 
the defense forces have been portrayed by some as a barbaric 
force he said 
he warned teachers as public servants to stay clear of party 
politics despite repeated warnings we have had to part ways with 
some teachers because of their contacts with political parties 
he said 
western diplomats in rangoon have reported authorities arrested 
at least 2000 people since putting the two leaders of the main 
opposition group under house arrest on july 20 
aung san suu kyi and tin oo who head the national league for 
democracy were accused of trying to divide the people and the 
military after criticizing the governments human rights record 
the us embassy in rangoon says it has received credible 
reports that many prodemocracy activists have been tortured 
sometimes fatally after being arrested

city investigators who have spent nearly five 
months scrutinizing the personal finances of mayor tom bradley have

the former congressman said tuesday he decided to disclose the 
family secret after discussions with his brothers kevin and philip 
and his sister theresa kevin and theresa joined him at his home in 
suburban atlanta for the news conference 
my fathers a very sick man swindall said 
swindalls father nathan denied the allegations of abuse 
swindall a republican who represented georgias 4th district in 
congress for two terms until his defeat in 1988 was sentenced 
monday to a year in prison for his conviction on nine counts of 
perjury he also was fined 30000 plus 450 in court costs 
the former congressman said immediately after his trial that he 
did not take the stand because a deposition taken in connection with 
a dispute with his father contained information about something my 
father did to a family member 
swindall said tuesday he felt certain that prosecutors would have 
asked him on the witness stand about the alleged incidents which he 
described a day earlier as so disgusting i will not even publicly 
disclose it 
us attorney robert barr said tuesday night he did not believe 
the prosecution would have raised the allegations during the june 
trial 
as far as i can tell this has nothing to do with his case hes 
having a severe case of monday morning quarterbacking barr said 
swindalls sister said her father had sexually abused her as a 
young teenager but that her siblings had agreed not to discuss the 
matter publicly until now 
nathan swindall denied abusing his daughter 
when anybody accuses me of incest he better be proving it i 
deny that completely he said 
swindall 38 remains free on his own recognizance pending an 
appeal 
swindall was convicted june 20 lying to a federal grand jury in 
1988 about his negotiations for an 850000 loan from a federal 
agent posing as a drug money launderer

the national football league suspended 13 players 
who tested positive for steroids indicating that warnings of a 
crackdown on the musclebuilding drugs months ago may have worked 
the action marked the first time us professional athletes had 
been suspended for steriod use no other league conducts mandatory 
tests for the drugs 
the small number of suspensions under the new steroid policy 
seemed to please even the nfl players association which has 
challenged the accuracy of tests and the suspensions 
the fact that so few players have been suspended for alleged 
steroid use indicates that the public perception of the steroid 
problem in the nfl is greatly exaggerated said gene upshaw 
executive director of the union and former allpro guard 
of the 13 players suspended for four weeks only pro bowl guard 
ron solt of the philadelphia eagles was of any prominence 
meanwhile two other prominent players were suspended for using 
illegal drugs allpro cornerback leroy irvin of the los angeles 
rams and tight end orson mobley of denver will miss the final 
exhibition game and the first three regularseason games 
commissioner pete rozelle announced the steroid policy on march 
21 saying he wanted to allow time for players who might be using 
steroids to get them out of their system before the start of 
training camp a letter detailing the plan was sent 10 days later to 
all players 
in both 1987 and 1988 6 percent of the players had positive 
steroid tests but no suspensions were imposed 
the percentages were much lower this time the nfl tested more 
than 2200 players for both illegal drugs and steroids an 
unspecified number of players tested positive but already have been 
cut from their teams the league said 
the warnings seem to have worked even by the testimony of one of 
those caught linebacker mark mraz of the los angeles raiders 
he was very disappointed and very emotional coach mike 
shanahan said he said he was aware of the new policy since april 
1 he informed me that he had not been on them since then 
but coach lindy infante of green bay who lost offensive linemen 
keith uecker and mike ariey said the warnings may not have been 
enough 
after all that was mentioned about it and all the letters that 
had gone out and all the notoriety about the decision to test for it 
and punish the people caught for it im quite shocked that anybody 
would run the risk of this happening infante said 
the 13 players also included three buffalo bills brothers tom 
doctor a linebacker and sean doctor a fullback and linebacker 
matt jaworksi 
others were defensive back maurice douglass of the chicago bears 
running back vince amoia and wide receiver bobby riley of the new 
york jets tight end vernon kirk of the los angeles rams and 
running back keith henderson and nose tackle rollin putzier of san 
francisco 
coach joe walton of the jets said he would release amoia and 
riley 
but general manager harry gamble of the eagles said he would 
welcome back solt and buffalo general manager bill polian said all 
three of his suspended players will make the team 
they are not druggies polian said theyre good kids who 
made a mistake and are paying the penalty for it 
upshaw said some players had called the union claiming they were 
innocent he suggested that tests may have mistaken other medication 
as steroids or masking agents designed to hide the their 
presence

but he bets you knew his dimples until a plastic surgeon smoothed 
one away and so he says killed his livelihood 
in a lawsuit made known tuesday in state supreme court in 
manhattan conroy said his earnings as an actor in commercials 
dropped more than twothirds after a 1983 facelift erased his left 
dimple

smith how important his dimples were to his appearances in ads for 
irish spring soap bobs big boy restaurants hathaway shirts the 
belmont racetrack and dellwood milk among others he said smith

a roman catholic journalist in a rare 
criticism of the church said cardinal jozef glemps remarks about 
jews may be deeply wounding to people who lost loved ones in the 
nazi holocaust 
criticism of glemps comments on jewishcatholic relations spread 
worldwide on tuesday although some catholic clerics said the polish 
primates remarks may have been misconstrued 
glemp told pilgrims at jasna gora monastery at czestochowa on 
saturday that polish antisemitism would disappear if jews abandon 
antipolonism or antipolish sentiments 
he asked jews to understand that it offended poles religious 
sensibilities and feelings of sovereignty to insist on removal of a 
carmelite convent set up on the edge of the former nazi death camp 
at auschwitz 
dear jews do not talk to us from the position of a nation 
elevated over all others and do not put to us conditions that are 
impossible to meet glemp said 
but he intensified charges of antisemitism by using language 
that invoked the image of jews spreading communism and by saying 
that jews collaborated with nazis during world war ii that jews as 
businessmen neglected or detested poles and that jews have easy 
access to mass media 
polish catholic journalist krzysztof sliwinski said the 
expressions used by the primate even contrary to his intentions 
pose a danger of deeply wounding the feelings of many of those who 
are descendants and brothers of the holocaust victims 
the rare published criticism appeared monday in the polish 
oppositions gazeta wyborcza newspaper 
cardinal albert decourtray archbishop of lyon in france said 
tuesday it was unlikely that glemps words were meant the way they 
were received 
he said the primate and bishops of poland cannot be accused of 
an antisemitism which they denounce 
referring to glemps comment about easy jewish access to mass 
media the international league against racism and antisemitism 
said in paris that he had made use of arguments used against jews 
by the nazis yesterday and by the extreme right in france today 
yossi sarid a legislator from the leftwing citizens rights 
movement in israel said tuesday in jerusalem antisemitism has a 
long history in poland and i think it is ridiculous to talk about 
antipolonism 
romes chief rabbi elio toaff said in a newspaper interview 
that the question of antisemitism is something the church has to 
face the analysis has to be deep enough to eradicate once and 
for all the antisemitism that still exists in many countries like 
poland 
it is particularly serious that it was glemp one noted for 
diplomacy and political gifts who confused cause and effects 
said tullia zevi head of the union of italian jewish communities 
quoted in the same article monday in romes i messaggero 
the representative council of jewish institutions of france 
issued a statement monday calling glemps comments malicious and 
out of place 
john cardinal oconnor the archbishop of new york said tuesday 
he was shocked by glemps harmful remarks 
in a news conference oconnor also called on polish church 
officials to honor their commitment to move the carmelite convent at 
auschwitz 
the convent site has been criticized as offensive because an 
estimated 25 million of the 4 million victims of auschwitzbirkenau 
were executed simply for being jewish 
only several thousand jews live in poland today compared with a 
prewar jewish population of 35 million 
relations between the catholic church in poland and jewish groups 
have been strained since aug 10 when cardinal franciszek macharski 
of krakow whose diocese includes the camp announced the church was 
suspending a 1987 agreement to move the convent he said it could 
not fulfill the agreement in an atmosphere of aggressive demands 
oconnor said glemps comments could be construed to shift the 
blame to the jews for demanding that a signed accord be carried 
out 
i dont think that is just and i dont think that is 
charitable and it certainly doesnt represent my position 
oconnor said 
the proposal to remove the convent founded in 1984 just outside 
the auschwitz fence has found little sympathy in poland poles have 
argued that thousands of the victims at auschwitz were polish 
political prisoners including many priests and nuns 
most poles acknowledge that antisemitism still exists in poland 
but some say its depth is exaggerated and note that many poles 
risked their lives to protect jews during the war

in the world of mathematics gregory and david chudnovsky are 
known for going the extra mile 
unsatisfied with their record 600milelong calculation of pi in 
june the brothers more than doubled that record coming up with a 
number containing more than a billion digits 
theyre starting more calculations so it goes on from here 
denis arvay a spokesman for ibm said tuesday i dont know when 
theyre going to stop 
meanwhile six california scientists extended mans search into 
the infinite by determining the worlds largest known prime number 
the find left joel f smith one of the researchers groping for 
a way to describe the 65087digit number 
its godawful large smith said theres nothing in the 
real universe that is comparable at all that you measure in those 
numbers 
pi the ratio between the diameter and circumference of a circle 
begins 314159 then continues on indefinitely with no known 
duplication or pattern 
since pi was first approximated at 3 17 in ancient greece it 
took centuries and the invention of the computer in recent decades 
for scientists to calculate the ratio to more than 100000 decimal 
places 
but in less than three months the chudnovskys extended their 
record calculation from 480 million decimal places to more than a 
billion 
the columbia university researchers did their work on two 
supercomputers at international business machines corps thomas j 
watson research center in yorktown heights ny the company said 
the new mark of 1011196691 digits appears to be a record 
arvay said 
peter renz associate director of the mathematical association of 
america said he had not heard of anybody exceeding the researchers 
mark 
in june the chudnovskys said their 480 milliondigit pi would 
stretch for 600 miles if printed 
at the time david chudnovsky said calculating pi to such lengths 
is useful for testing the performance of computer hardware and 
software he called the task the ultimate stress test 
in california the six researchers at computer maker amdahl corp 
spent evenings and weekends during the last year using the companys 
machines to find the largest prime number 
the number equals 391581 multiplied by 2 to the 216193rd power 
minus one to put that in perspective thats 600 times the number 
of atoms in the known universe according to sergio e zarantonello 
one of the researchers 
its like going to the moon in a sense theres not a lot 
there but its important scientifically to do it because the 
technology proves so useful researcher bodo parady said 
a prime number is any number that can be divided evenly only by 1 
and itself 
according to the guinness book of world records the previous 
record was set in 1985 by david slowinski of cray research inc the 
supercomputer maker the new number discovered aug 6 has 37 more 
digits and is a trillion trillion trillion times larger 
sunnyvale califbased amdahl said guinness had accepted the 
number for entry into the publication 
the discovery was announced at a meeting this week of the 
american mathematical society by sam wagstaff jr a computer 
scientist at purdue university 
although the number itself has no known practical application 
the advanced multiplication programs honed by the researchers during 
their work already are being used by scientists searching the 
universe for pulsars rotating neutron stars 
the process also has applications in cryptology and bank 
transaction coding which use large prime numbers 
the other amdahl researchers were john brown landon curt noll 
and gene ward smith

an afghan rebel leader who has been a 
major recipient of us military aid will boycott meetings of the 
guerrillas interim government until elections are held his 
spokesman said today 
it was the latest blow to the moslem insurgents 
governmentinexile which has been troubled by bickering and 
fighting 
the leader gulbaddin hekmatyar of the fundamentalist 
hezbiislami rebel group said he will no longer attend the 
governments cabinet meetings until elections are held his 
spokesman abdul qadeer karyab said in an interview 
the move fulfilled a threat hekmatyar made earlier this month 
when he criticized the interim government for not meeting a 
sixmonth deadline for elections and the drafting of an islamic 
constitution for afghanistan 
the charismatic rebel leader has repeatedly been accused of 
treachery by rival guerrilla fighters 
his group was accused of carrying out last months massacre of 32 
rebels of jamiatiislami an equally powerful but more liberal 
guerrilla group 
washington the major supporter of the rebels condemned the 
killings in afghanistans northern takhar province 
since then the fighting between the two rebel groups has 
escalated and the latest reports claim hundreds may have died in 
recent clashes 
jamiat leader burhanuddin rabbani called for hekmatyars 
suspension from the government following the takhar slayings 
sibghatullah mojaddidi president of the rebels interim 
government branded hekmatyar a killer and claimed he has used 
us military backing to kill other guerrillas and afghans 
hekmatyars group has been a major recipient of us military aid 
channeled through pakistan 
united states policy gives full support to the fragile 
governmentinexile 
peter tomsen the us special envoy to the guerrillas was 
meeting afghan rebels based in the southwestern pakistani city of 
quetta today and could not be immediately reached for comment 
tomsen is on his second tour of pakistan where the majority of 
the anticommunist rebels are headquartered aside from 
accommodating the fractious guerrilla government whose membership 
is limited to seven major rebel parties pakistan shelters 3 million 
afghan war refugees 
for more than a decade the insurgents have been fighting to 
topple the marxist government of president najib the guerrrillas 
also receive military aid from saudi arabia pakistan and other arab 
states 
in 1979 moscow sent in troops to back its communist allies 
against a growing insurgency and to replace one leader with another 
but in february the last of more than 100000 red army soldiers left 
afghanistan 
elections were promised by the rebel leadership within six months 
of its governments establishment in february 
syed gailani the leader of the moderate national islamic front 
of afghanistan holds the supreme court portfolio which puts him in 
charge of elections but a spokesman for his group azim nasserzia 
said the government does not have the money to hold the elections 
somehow nothing has been allocated for the supreme court to 
have its own office let alone conduct an election the spokesman 
said 
it cant be done by just one man

moldavias communist party chief in an effort to 
placate outraged minority groups proposed today that the republic 
adopt a weaker version of a law making moldavian the official 
language an activist said 
the compromise which reportedly resulted from a telephone 
conversation between the party chief and president mikhail s 
gorbachev is aimed at stopping widespread strikes and other 
protests in the republic 
the initial proposed law would substitute moldavian for russian 
in virtually all government and business transactions in the 
republic russians and other minorities in the republic say the 
proposal is discriminatory 
the proposed compromise outlined to the supreme soviet by 
moldavian party chief semen grossu would make moldavian the 
language for government officials and documents and russian the 
tongue for everyday contact among the republics ethnic groups 
the compromise was reported by vasily nestase a leader of the 
promoldavian peoples front who spoke by telephone from the 
republics capital kishinev 
moldavia which borders romania now has no law specifying which 
language is to be used but russian has traditionally been the 
tongue for government affairs 
grossu proposed the compromise after reporting he had spoken with 
gorbachev by telephone tuesday night about the language controversy 
the moldavian party chief did not say whether gorbachev had 
suggested the compromise but nestase said it was widely believed 
this was the case 
we think this is the most realistic compromise nataly 
pascal another peoples front member said in a telephone 
interview we support this compromise and were not the only 
ones 
the moldavian supreme soviet began debating the proposal on 
tuesday and nestase said the session would continue thursday 
gorbachev has quietly been involved in several attempts recently 
to quell nationalist unrest breaking out in may of the soviet 
unions republics he told the lithuanian party chief during the 
weekend that the independence movement there had gone too far 
gorbachev also worked out with other members of the ruling 
politburo a tough party statement saturday condemning nationalism 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov told a news briefing 
tuesday the statement by the policymaking central committee warned 
that independence movements were leading the country into an 
abyss 
a strike organizer in the moldavian city of tiraspol where 
russians and other minorities walked off their jobs last week to 
protest the proposed language law said strikers were willing to 
consider the compromise even though they would still prefer that 
russian and moldavian be given equal status 
the weekly moscow news today highlighted unemployment as a factor 
in the republics unrest it said at least 150000 of the republics 
42 million people are unemployed and the number is growing 
pravda repeated earlier criticism of peoples front activists 
accusing them of spreading the seeds of separatism and 
nationalism and claiming that moldavian parliamentarians ordered 
pravda correspondent to leave the republic 
the supreme soviet session addressing the law opened tuesday and 
several thousand people some carrying redyellowandblue moldavian 
banners gathered after the debate in downtown kishinev to show 
support for the peoples front 
we have to seize the moment said ala myndycanu a member of 
the peoples front governing council we have to solve our 
problems before moscow does 
but nonmoldavian activists members of the russianlanguage 
group yedinstvo warned that life wont be quiet if the original 
law was passed over the objections of strikers 
disgruntled russianspeaking residents of the republic are 
striking at almost 200 factories and offices to protest the bill 
said vsevolod yampolsky of the tiraspol strike committee most of 
the strikes are in cities with large russian populations 
tass reported today that railroad workers in several moldavian 
cities had joined the strike 
the portion of the bill that would be cut out under the 
compromise would have made moldavian the language among russians 
ukrainians jews bulgarians and other nationalities in the 
republic that goes farther than the language laws in a number of 
other republics 
many nonmoldavians do not speak moldavian but they share some 
knowledge of russian as a result of soviet schooling 
the law also would restore the latin alphabet replacing the 
cyrillic imposed by dictator josef stalin after he annexed moldavia 
from romania in 1940 stalin imposed the cyrillic used in russian 
to back up his claim that romanians and moldavians are two distinct 
nationalities 
ethnic moldavians make up 64 percent of the republics 42 
million people

a solidarity lawmaker criticized the 
communists foreign policy record today and suggested a 
noncommunist official should be named foreign minister in prime 
minister tadeusz mazowieckis new government 
bronislaw geremek head of the solidarity parliamentary 
delegation also said in the prosolidarity gazeta wyborcza 
newspaper today that the communists should assume at least one 
economic ministry so the party would have a sense of 
coresponsibility for economic policy 
communist leaders have been pressing to keep the ministry of 
foreign affairs in the hands of current foreign minister tadeusz 
olechowski a party member 
the post is one of several areas of conflict as mazowiecki a 
longtime solidarity activist forms the east blocs first government 
led by noncommunists 
geremek has said that the new government would be announced 
before sept 10 mazowiecki assumed office on aug 24 
experiences in polish foreign policy indicate that the 
communist party does not serve national interests geremek said 
in the interview published today 
he cited a recent agreement with warsaw pact ally east germany 
over disputed waters in the baltic sea near the port of szczecin 
which many poles believe was settled to polands disadvantage 
geremek noted that the information department of the foreign 
ministry legally functions as a service unit for the central 
committee of the party this does not correspond to the 
requirements of the new period he said 
although geremek did not say specifically that the ministry 
should be taken away from the party his remarks about breaking the 
partys monopoly on foreign policy appeared to indicate that the 
ministry should go either to solidarity or one of two minor allied 
parties the united peasants and the democrats 
communist party secretary leszek miller who is acting as the 
partys envoy in the coalition talks with mazowiecki argued 
strongly tuesday for the party to retain control of the ministry 
we think that the best candidate is tadeusz olechowski he 
said in an interview with the party paper trybuna ludu if 
professionalism is a criterion then undoubtedly olechowski is an 
expert of the highest class 
he also cited polands alliances in the east bloc that he said 
have protected national security 
no matter what you accuse the party of its foreign policy is 
not subject to criticism miller said it has guaranteed us a 
safe stable place in europe polands favorable position in the 
world and alliances which allow us a feeling of national security 
society needs this feeling and it has to be maintained 
geremek said he favored only limited participation by the 
communists in the mazowiecki government broad participation 
would not be understandable to public opinion he said 
solidarity already has promised the communists control of the 
important defense and interior ministries which control the army 
and police 
geremek reiterated in todays article that the party ought to 
take one of the five economic ministries finance agriculture 
foreign trade labor or industry that way it could not be in 
opposition to the governments economic policy and spread social 
demagogy he said 
he suggested that noncommunist adminstrators serve just below 
the defense and interior ministers 
another controversial area is control of the mass media geremek 
said the committee that oversees state radio and television should 
be put under control of parliament where solidarity and its allies 
hold a majority 
personnel decisions in radio and television will be one of the 
quickest signs of change under the new government geremek said

the bush administration appears to be largely 
on automatic pilot because of the presidents failure to fill 
many top executive branch positions democratic congressional 
researchers say 
bush had not nominated anyone by aug 9 to fill 160 of the top 
394 positions requiring senate confirmation the democratic study 
group said tuesday 
it is believed that this number of vacancies so late in a 
presidents first year in office is without precedent the report 
said 
among them although bush has said he wants to be remembered as 
an education president are five of the seven assistant 
secretaries of education it said 
four assistant administrator slots are vacant at the 
environmental protection agency and the president has not nominated 
anyone as chairman of the council on environmental quality the 
report said openings were also listed for three undersecretaries 
and 13 assistant secretaries in other departments 
it appears as though a significant portion of the government is 
on automatic pilot said the dsg an organization of house 
democrats that provides research papers to members of congress 
the dsg said it did not have comparable figures for past 
administrations although its analysis in may showed that four 
previous presidents had made appointments during their first six 
weeks in office at a pace two to four times as fast as bush 
deputy white house press secretary stephen hart reached by 
telephone in kennebunkport maine where the president is 
vacationing said the administrations count is not the same as the 
dsgs 
their numbers conflict because they wanted to go with the 
broadest brush to try and add to the sensational nature of their 
conclusions hart said 
the white house counts 308 presidential appointments within the 
cabinet departments hart said appointees to 129 of these posts have 
been confirmed and 38 are awaiting confirmation he said 25 reagan 
appointees had been retained and 84 candidates were now being 
cleared for appointment he said most of the remaining 37 vacancies 
had candidates under consideration 
the notion that somehow george bush has been crippled by the 
fact that he hasnt got all of his assistant secretaries in place 
just doesnt make any sense hart said 
the dsg report dealt with a larger figure because it included 
posts outside of the cabinet departments 
the report said that as of aug 10 only 156 of the 394 positions 
were filled by an appointee confirmed by the senate nominations for 
60 positions were awaiting confirmation and remain so since 
congress has been in recess 
two nominations of john tower to be secretary of defense and 
william lucas to be assistant attorney general for civil rights 
were rejected tower was turned down by the full senate and lucas by 
the judiciary committee 
for 16 positions appointees of former president reagan have been 
asked to remain on the job 
it is not clear how the failure to fill so many key positions 
in a timely manner will affect the bush administration or the 
country generally the report said it does however appear to 
set the administration on a course that is virtually 180 degrees at 
variance with the prevailing view of scholars and former white house 
officials on how the presidency should be managed 
defenders of the administration have argued that bush did not 
need to move quickly because he succeeded a president of his own 
party and thus did not need to make major policy changes 
the dsg however said the slower pace could be as important a 
liability to the bush administration as it would be to any other 
even if the remaining nominations are made and confirmed quickly 
this fall those people would have missed most of the planning for 
next years budget and legislative initiatives the report said 
all of the cabinet positions have been filled however posts for 
which no nomination has been made and no reagan holdover is in place 
include two assistant secretaries of agriculture an undersecretary 
of commerce a deputy undersecretary and six assistant secretaries 
of defense an assistant secretary of energy two assistant 
secretaries of health and human services two assistant secretaries 
of housing and urban development an assistant secretary of the 
interior a deputy attorney general and associate attorney general 
an undersecretary and an assistant secretary of state an 
undersecretary and an assistant secretary of the treasury and three 
assistant secretaries of veterans affairs 
the only department at which all the top posts have been filled 
is transportation the report said

dorothy schiff the heiress who molded the 
historic new york post into one of the nations most liberal dailies 
during her 37 years at its helm died of cancer today she was 86 
peter faris a vice president at the post said schiff died at 
her manhattan home she had been sick since may 
the post schiff once said advocated honest unionism social 
reform and humane government programs her paper was a 
middleclass tabloid packed with columns and features restrained 
only by schiffs legendary tight fist 
the post is the oldest continuously published newspaper in 
america first published by alexander hamilton in 1801 and was one 
of the few metropolitan newspapers owned by a woman 
she was credited with saving the post when she broke with other 
publishers during a long newspaper strike in 1963 and resumed 
publishing under the old contract the paper gained circulation 
during that period and within a few years became the citys only 
afternoon paper 
often voted least likely to succeed in new yorks competitive 
journalistic climate she outmaneuvered such moneyed rivals as 
hearsts journalamerican scrippshowards world telegram and sun 
and john hay whitneys herald tribune and in the end outlasted 
them noted newsweek 
on nov 19 1976 after years of turning down potential buyers 
she sold the post to media magnate rupert murdoch reportedly for 
31 million murdoch transformed the post into a racier and more 
politically conservative tabloid before selling it to real estate 
developer peter s kalikow last year 
dorothy schiff known to many as dolly was born on march 11 
1903 in new york city to mortimer and adele neustadt schiff her 
grandfather was financier jacob schiff a founder of the kuhn loeb 
banking house and a prominent philanthropist 
the heiress studied at new yorks exclusive brearly school and 
attended bryn mawr college in pennsylvania 
i was a rich kid of the right kind not the robber baron type 
and had been to the right schools she said in a diary entry 
quoted in a 1976 biography by jeffrey potter called men money and 
magic i remember being furious whenever it her wealth was 
mentioned people even said not entirely joking come on give me 
a million you wont even miss it 
but schiffs thrift at the newspaper was legendary the post 
always seemed to do more with less the smallest staff the most 
decrepit equipment 
i dont know if its fear of being selfindulgent or a 
puritanical guilt but spending just isnt easy for me she once 
said 
in the early 1930s schiff became involved in social welfare 
efforts a settlement house for immigrants several hospitals a 
club that provided lunches to women looking for jobs in new york 
she became a confidante of president franklin d roosevelt and 
his wife eleanor at one point she declined roosevelts invitation 
to run a program in his administration for farm women 
her involvement in politics escalated however george backer 
her husband was appointed to the city council and then ran 
unsuccessfully for congress schiff was a democratic candidate for 
the state constitutional convention in 1938 losing to city parks 
commissioner robert moses 
in 1939 schiff bought the post at backers request at first 
backer served as editor and president she served as director and 
vice president and her ownership was not public knowledge 
financial losses led schiff to believe that the paper needed 
comic strips columns features and a tabloid format when backer 
disagreed schiff promoted theodore olin thackrey from feature 
editor to executive editor 
in 1942 schiff became president and publisher she divorced 
backer in 1943 and married thackrey 
she and thackrey differed in print in 1948 thackrey supported 
progressive party candidate henry wallace schiff backed republican 
thomas e dewey by 1950 thackrey was out both as post editor and 
as schiffs husband in the 1950s under james wechsler the post 
became known for investigative reporting 
the post eventually found an audience among the citys liberal 
middle class 
after years of profits the papers fortunes dimmed in the 1970s 
as much of its audience moved to the suburbs ultimately schiff 
sold it to murdoch it was a terrible headache she said 
schiffs four marriages ended in divorce her first husband was 
richard bw hall followed by backer thackrey and rudolf sonneborn 
she is survived by her two daughters adele hall sweet and 
sarahann kramarsky her son mortimer h hall 15 grandchildren and 
nine greatgrandchildren 
faris said a private burial was planned with a memorial service

the nations roman catholic bishops are urging 
the supreme court to use a pair of cases from ohio and minnesota to 
overturn its 1973 decision legalizing abortion 
in a friendofthecourt brief filed earlier this week the us 
catholic conference said past highcourt rulings on abortion have 
usurped legislative authority the brief added for this court 
the time has come to decide whether to continue to write rules or to 
allow legislatures to legislate 
the catholic conference an arm of the national conference of 
catholic bishops filed a similar brief earlier this year in a case 
the court used to give states greater power to regulate abortions 
the justices already have agreed to study the ohio and minnesota 
cases during the term that begins in october both cases involve 
laws that require doctors to notify the parents of young unmarried 
girls who seek abortions 
the court also will study an illinois case involving stringent 
regulation of abortion clinics 
the ohio and minnesota parental notice laws have been portrayed 
erroneously as creating conflicts between the rights of parents and 
children the catholic conference brief asserted 
if a family is to retain any vitality when confronted by this 
reality of a young girls pregnancy its members must be 
entitled to reflect upon and discuss whether the girl should 
consider termination of her pregnancy through abortion the brief 
said 
it added to rule that a state may not shield the family for a 
brief time for this kind of consultation is to deny family integrity 
and ultimately to undermine familial relationships

a group of minority and female police 
officers that sued the city for discrimination has accepted a 
settlement after recent us supreme court rulings against 
affirmative action programs 
there are mixed feelings said stephen drew the attorney 
representing the 10 minority and 11 female officers considering 
the latest rulings we did not feel that the laws of this country 
as interpreted by the supreme court are favorable to minority and 
female litigants 
according to the settlement the city will pay the officers 
325000 including court costs and attorney fees it was not 
disclosed how much each person would receive drew said 
the supreme court recently issued decisions to restrict 
affirmative action programs and make it more difficult for 
plaintiffs to prove discrimination in the workplace 
in march 1988 the minority officers eight blacks a hispanic 
and an american indian sued the city seeking 46 million in 
damages two months later 11 female officers filed a similar suit 
seeking more than 16 million 
both suits alleged the officers were denied promotional 
opportunities because of their race or gender the two cases were 
joined for the purpose of settlement talks the trial was to begin 
sept 12 
at the time the suits were filed only one of the departments 45 
command officers sergeant and above was classified as a minority 
at the heart of both suits was a written exam and performance 
evaluation for the position of sergeant that the officers said were 
discriminatory and never had been validated to ensure they conformed 
to civil rights regulations 
the city has agreed to hire an independent consultant to develop 
a professionally validated test for sergeant promotions 
drew said the timing of the supreme court rulings made it 
impractical for him to take the case to court 
he said he believes the settlement indicates a willingness on 
the citys part to put the bad behind us and move forward hopefully 
that will lead to better minority and female representation on the 
police force

at us request the organization of american 
states will hold a special meeting thursday to present evidence of 
the alleged involvement of panamas military leader manuel antonio 
noriega in drug trafficking it was announced today 
thursday is the expiration date of the term of panamas 
provisional president manuel solias palma appointed by the 
national assembly last year us officials and panamas opposition 
parties are concerned that noriega will name a puppet government and 
ignore calls for free elections 
the meeting will come just one week after the oas dealt a blow to 
us hopes of ousting the general by adopting a resolution that 
stopped short of calling on noriega to step down 
in requesting the meeting the united states said it wants to 
present a summary of the evidence and elaboration of the united 
states position on the critical situation in panama the oas press 
office said 
the decision to call for a meeting of the hemispheric council 
came in response to a challenge by panamas delegate at last weeks 
session for the united states to present evidence of noriegas 
alleged wrongdoings said us officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
they said it was not yet clear whether the evidence will be 
presented by deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger who 
represented the united states at last weeks session or by another 
official 
in london meanwhile the british foreign office today urged 
noriega to step down and open the way to a peaceful democratic 
resolution of panamas problems 
the oas resolution last week expressed deep concern over the 
failure of a mediating team dispatched by the organization to 
promote a democratic transfer of power in panama 
the document called on panamanians to settle their differences by 
sept 1 the date on which the constitution calls for the 
installation of a new president 
most oas delegates viewed us demands that noriega step down as 
a dangerous precedent for intervention in the internal affairs of 
member states 
the united states has been pressing noriega to step down since 
february 1988 when he was indicted by two federal grand juries in 
florida on charges involving drug trafficking 
noriega has claimed the efforts are an attempt to renege on the 
us pledge to hand over the panama canal to his countrys control 
next year 
noriega has served as commander of the panamanian defense forces 
for six years us officials believe he will install a puppet 
successor next month after voiding results of may 7 elections that 
observers agree gave a wide majority to the usbacked opposition

republican ileana roslehtinen who became the first 
cubanamerican elected to congress pledged today to unite miamis 
multiethnic community after an emotional race for the late rep 
claude peppers seat 
i think its been a terribly divisive and ethnically divisive 
campaign ms roslehtinen said on nbcs today show after 
defeating democrat gerald richman in tuesdays special election 
but now its time for healing now we have to reach out to all 
those sections she said i know there are a lot of people out 
there who feel alienated it was a very bitter battle but now were 
going to start healing those wounds 
richman who didnt rule out seeking the seat again in the 
scheduled election in 14 months also promised early today to try to 
ease the ethnic tensions 
i and she will unify the community richman said 
during the monthlong campaign ms roslehtinen refused to debate 
richman following claims that his american seat theme stirred 
prejudices against hispanics 
richman had said his remark this is an american seat was an 
appeal to voters to decide on qualifications not birthplace he 
also said it was a response to gop national chairman lee atwaters 
statement that the party wanted to elect a cubanamerican 
it was a rough campaign wounds from it need to heal said 
rep guy vander jagt rmich chairman of the national republican 
congressional committee 
ms roslehtinen 37 a state senator since 1982 and wife of us 
attorney dexter lehtinen called on richman and his supporters to 
meet to discuss the drug and crime problems facing miami 
we do not have the luxury to waste time on divisive politics 
she told more than 1500 cheering supporters most from miamis 
conservative cuban community we must focus on what we have in 
common and not ponder on the negative 
pepper the liberal advocate for the elderly and the only person 
to hold the seat died may 30 at age 88 
ms roslehtinens campaign included appearances by president 
bush and vice president dan quayle her campaign chairman was the 
presidents son jeb 
atwater called the victory a gop milestone in the south 
that seat has been a democratic seat since it was created he 
said from washington for us to win it is a major victory 
with all 159 precincts reporting ms roslehtinen had 49638 
votes or 53 percent to richmans 43759 votes or 47 percent 
turnout was 506 percent unusually high for a special election 
the district covers black neighborhoods such as liberty city 
most of miami miami beach and miami springs and sections of 
bluecollar hispanic hialeah and upscale coral gables and key 
biscayne 
according to unofficial returns predominantly latin precincts 
had turnouts of more than 60 percent and gave ms roslehtinen 80 to 
90 percent 
richman a 48yearold attorney and political novice conceded 
that a surprisingly strong hispanic turnout tipped the election 
they voted overwhelmingly said richman who counted on heavy 
backing from black and fellow jewish voters and the 30000plus edge 
in registered democrats weve got to get everyone in this 
community to get out and exercise their right to vote if that had 
happened we would have won tonight 
some of the cuban exiles at ms roslehtinens victory gathering 
said that although her election is symbolic of their assimilation 
into the united states they still feel excluded from mainstream 
america 
we have brought ileana to office on our own with no support 
from others said richardo samiter sr 55 we have been trying 
to cross the bridge that separates us but we are treated like 
secondclass citizens these things we do not forget quickly 
this is a very important step for cubans one of us is in 
washington now said mario esteves 49 she is our blood she 
knows our mind she knows our feelings 
ms roslehtinen faces reelection in 14 months when peppers 
term would have expired

about 500 people were allowed home after 
they were evacuated early today because of burning pesticides at a 
nearby feed store 
several residents reported breathing problems and a few 
firefighters were overcome by smoke but there were no serious 
injuries said lt andrew casciato of the ravenna fire department 
a threeblock area which included apartments and group homes for 
the elderly was evacuated he said 
the fire was under control but still smoldering at 9 am more 
than three hours after it was reported at the ravenna landmark 
grainery 
the fire broke out in a section that contained fertilizers and 
pesticides casciato said the area was destroyed casciato said 
the product itself was being consumed by the fire we didnt 
want to put water on it because that would allow it to contaminate 
the ground he said 
the fertilizers and pesticides were allowed to burn out although 
some water was initially used to cool down the area and keep the 
fire from spreading to adjoining buildings he said 
timothy hickin a duty officer at the ohio environmental 
protection agency in columbus said investigators would be sent into 
the building when the fire was completely extinguished

former first lady nancy reagan says fear 
wasnt keeping her away from a school in a ganginfested 
neighborhood she simply was never invited 
board of education member rita walters had criticized mrs 
reagan saying her refusal to appear next month at john muir junior 
high school to present an antidrug grant was an insult to the 
community 
but deputy police chief glenn levant called a news conference 
tuesday to clear up the controversy saying it turns out to be 
much ado about nothing 
the only thing i can surmise is the school board was not 
presented all of the facts theres nothing political about drug 
abuse levant said 
mrs reagan will present a 50000 nancy reagan foundation grant 
for school antidrug programs on sept 14 during drug abuse 
resistance education day ceremonies part of the money was earmarked 
for the john muir school and the school board staff told walters the 
former first lady wouldnt go to the los angeles neighborhood 
because of security concerns 
there simply was no invitation request or expression of 
interest conveyed to the foundation or me that i make the 
presentation at john muir junior high school mrs reagan said

mr blackwell the celebrity fashion 
critic known for his annual acerbic worstdressed list is glad to 
see the beverly hills police department recognized for its nattiness 
the department won a special achievement award in a national 
bestdressed police contest sponsored by the national association of 
uniform manufacturers 
i think its because in beverly hills there is a greater sense 
of grooming blackwell said there are never any smudges they 
are opulently conspicuous in beverly hills 
actually it is almost like a private army in a separate 
country there in beverly hills 
top honors in cities with fewer than 200 officers went to the 
hickory nc police department 
although beverly hills officers wear the standard navy blue 
uniform lt robert curtis said an attention to detail gives them an 
appearance edge for example rather than black plastic buttons 
beverly hills cops use brass ones

a judge rejected a crack users plea for leniency 
and sentenced her to life imprisonment for letting a man rape her 
13yearold daughter to pay drug debts 
judge james j rashid said tuesday that susan barbier sunk to 
an intolerable level of humanity and showed no potential for 
rehabilitation 
barbier 29 who could be paroled in 10 years was convicted of 
firstdegree criminal sexual conduct for giving her daughter to a 
man who raped her twice 
anthony sawyer 28 was convicted on the same charge and was 
sentenced by another judge thursday to 40 to 60 years in prison 
barbier maintained her innocence 
in a letter to rashid dated aug 18 she said i feel i have 
been punished enough in losing her children to her exhusband 
the letter said the last two years of my life has been nothing 
but tragedy 
rashid said he imposed more than the 10 to 25 years called for in 
sentencing guidelines because they dont accurately reflect the 
nature of this crime 
your daughter trusted you and you abused that trust beyond all 
bounds of decency rashid told barbier 
this case demonstrates tragically the farreaching impact of 
drugs on innocent people the wayne county circuit judge said i 
have not heard of such a situation where drugs were responsible for 
a mother subjecting her own daughter to sexual abuse 
sawyer testified that barbier offered her daughter to settle a 
drug debt then smoked crack with him after the attack 
assistant prosecutor kelly ramsey said barbiers daughter called 
the may 1988 rape the worst hour of her life 
the child is grateful her pain is finally over ramsey said 
after tuesdays sentencing she can begin rebuilding herself 
the victim now 14 had written a twopage statement before 
sentencing but was too shaken to read it in court said her father 
michael dare 
she wanted to ask the judge to keep her mother in prison long 
enough that she cant endanger her younger children ages 6 and 
8 said dare 33 she spent so much time taking care of those kids 
that she felt like a mother instead of a sister 
dare said he plans to lobby for legislation easing regulations on 
taking children away from parents who are drug users 
wayne county juvenile court granted dare temporary custody of the 
victim and her sister 13 the two other children who are 
halfsisters were staying with a relative 
although barbier will be eligible for parole in 10 years rashid 
must first be notified and then has authority to deny her release 
ramsey said

the international red cross is working on 
a plan to transport at least 1500 east german refugees from hungary 
to the west in the next few days an austrian government source said 
today 
the report came amid heightened speculation that officials were 
formulating a plan to deal with thousands of east germans who have 
traveled to hungary in an effort to flee their communist homeland 
for the west 
a report in the munichbased abendzeitung newspaper today said 
15000 east germans would be allowed to go west from hungary by the 
weekend 
the crush of east germans who have also tried to flee this 
summer through east berlin and czechoslovakia has created friction 
between east germany and several other nations and forced west 
germany to close diplomatic facilities that have been overwhelmed by 
refugees in several east bloc cities 
the austrian government source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the international red cross plan involves 
transporting the refugees from hungary to austria and then to west 
germany the source said it was not yet clear if they would leave 
hungary by train or airplane 
there was speculation that a west german envoy sent to austria 
today was trying to work out the reported plan 
west germany dispatched the senior diplomat to meet austrian 
foreign minister alois mock foreign ministry spokesman walter 
greinert said 
the spokesman said bonn envoy michael jansen thanked mock for 
austrias role in offering help to thousands of east germans who had 
already fled across the hungarianaustrian border he declined to 
comment on whether jansen was working on a red cross plan 
rezsoe sztuchlik head of the foreign relations department of 
hungarys red cross said he had no knowledge of such a plan 
in budapest however a senior foreign ministry official gyula 
szelei told the associated press that hungary is working with both 
east and west germany to deal with the refugees 
the rush of refugees began in hungary after reformminded 
communist hungarian authorities began removing border fences in may 
some refugees say they are fleeing the hardline communist system 
in east germany but others say they are simply looking for a better 
economic life 
last week hungary allowed 108 east germans holed up in the west 
german embassy in budapest to go to west germany in a plan also 
organized by the genevabased international red cross 
but bonn and budapest said it was a onetime occurrence 
there are 2200 east germans in camps set up by the hungarian red 
cross for those who want to flee west with 150 new arrivals each 
day said sztuchlik 
at least 200 other east germans are holed up in bonns closed 
missions in east berlin and prague hoping to go to west germany 
where they receive automatic citizenship and assistance in starting 
a new life

a british official today said 
authorities will investigate whether security forces in northern 
ireland leaked documents that helped protestant gunman identify a 
roman catholic man they later killed 
however john cope the minister of state for northern ireland 
also suggested that the protestant group members made the claim to a 
reporter of the british broadcasting corp in order to discredit the 
police 
bbc reporter chris moore said in a television report tuesday that 
he had met with four masked men from the outlawed ulster freedom 
fighters or uff over the weekend he said he was taken to a house 
where he was shown the police documents and a videotape about 
suspected members of the irish republican army 
the predominantly catholic ira is fighting to end british rule in 
northern ireland and unite the 60 percent protestant province with 
the 95 percent catholic irish republic 
among those named in the police material was 28yearold loughlin 
maginn who was shot to death friday in his home in rathfriland 
the ulster freedom fighters a cover name for the protestant 
ulster defense association claimed it killed maginn because he was 
a member of the ira maginns family has denied the claim and said 
he had been harassed by security forces for a year 
moore said he was told the group got the documents through a 
breach of security at security force bases but he said they did 
not elaborate in his comments cope did not rule out that the 
documents could have been stolen rather than leaked 
the royal ulster constabulary or ruc the police force of the 
british province also said it was investigating the claim 
in his comments cope said one can only speculate as to why 
the uff have chosen to talk to the media in this way 
like the ira the uff has every reason to hate the ruc whose 
efforts have put many of its members behind bars it is not 
surprising that they will do their best to try to discredit the 
police and use the media for this purpose he said 
the government of ireland which has a consultative role in the 
provinces affairs said it was seeking an urgent clarification 
on the report from the british government 
the ulster defense association was formed in september 1971 as a 
coordinator for paramilitary groups that supported continued british 
rule of northern ireland 
the freedom fighters group like the ira is outlawed in northern 
ireland and its members are barred from appearing on television or 
radio 
there have been past cases in which members of the ulster defense 
regiment a local army unit that is being converted to a fulltime 
force were involved in sectarian murders 
in 1980 several police informers were killed after the ira 
obtained information from reserve police officers

a boycott by some artists of the corcoran 
gallery over its cancellation of a photography exhibit including 
pictures of genitalia has led to the indefinite postponement of 
two other scheduled contempory art exhibits gallery officials said 
today 
the scheduling and then cancellation in june of the exhibit by 
robert mapplethorpe touched off a political controversy that 
resulted in congress moving to restrict federal subsidies for 
artists 
the gallery said today contemporary artist annette lemieux has 
pulled what it described as her first major oneperson museum 
exhibition scheduled to run from oct 28 to dec 31 and that six 
scupltors also have canceled a show of their work scheduled to run 
from next feb 3 to april 8 
deborah shriver a spokeswoman for the corcoran acknowledged 
that l0 american painters including ms lemieux featured in a 
joint ussoviet exhibition to be featured next spring also have 
threatened to deny the gallery the right to display their work 
as far as we know that show is still on ms shriver said of 
the spring 1990 exhibit 10 plus 10 contemporary soviet and 
american painters a touring show arranged by the modern art 
museum of fort worth but we realize that the artists are upset 
ms lemieux notified the gallery in a letter last week that she 
was withdrawing her exhibit a week earlier two of the six 
sculptors in the exhibit titled the resonance of the odd object 
notified the corcoran they were canceling their show 
we believe the corcoran by its regrettable decision not only 
compromised its own curatorial standards but also demonstrated its 
complicity with the punishment subsequently attempted against other 
art instititions sculptors buss spector and donald lipski wrote 
the corcoran canceled the mapplethorpe exhibit two weeks before 
it was to go on display after protesting members of congress 
objected to three pictures of genitalia and homosexual activities in 
it 
the house later voted to cut the national endowment of the arts 
budget by 45000 the total of federal grants received by 
mapplethorpe and andres serrano a photographer whose picture of a 
crucifix in a jar of urine also touched off a protest 
and the senate last month approved legislation by sen jesse 
helms rnc that would prohibit federal financng of sexually 
explict artwork 
this is what we feared from day one christina orrcahall 
the corcorans director told the washington post were in the 
middle of the storm

free fatladen foods given to schools by 
the agriculture department are key obstacles to healthy school lunch 
programs a consumer nutrition group said today 
sixtyseven percent of the school food service directors 
questioned this spring by public voice for food and health policy 
said the usdas commodity distribution program is one of the most 
significant barriers to their efforts to provide nutritious meals 
the school lunch programs depend upon commodities provided free 
of charge by the federal government to help them stay afloat 
financially yet the commodities offered include a high proportion 
of fatladen foods said the report which is a followup to 
previous studies assessing the progress being made to reduce fat in 
school lunches 
scott dunn acting administator of usdas food and nutrition 
service said the department is committed to dietary guidelines 
developed jointly with the department of health and human services 
but he said the guidelines dont set quantitative standards for 
fat and there is no scientific consensus on appropriate levels of 
fat in childrens diets 
more than 80 percent of the directors agreed that efforts are 
needed to reduce fat in their school lunches and said they have 
taken some steps toward that end 
yet many of the directors said they were unaware that most health 
authorities agree that fat in childrens diets should be reduced to 
about 30 percent of calories public voice said twentyeight 
percent were uncertain of the proper average level of fat in school 
lunches 
the us department of agriculture has provided only limited 
guidance to the directors on how to cut back on fat to achieve this 
level such as through comprehensive handson training in meal 
preparation or guidance on working with food suppliers said the 
study 
other findings included 
only 6 percent of the directors have established target levels 
or ranges for fat in their programs central city school districts 
are eight times more likely to establish such limits than are rural 
districts 
twentythree percent of those questioned said they did not 
receive any guidance or guidelines on how to purchase foods or 
modify recipes to reduce fat the rest reported having limited 
access to written materials or training programs 
when asked to identify the single most important thing that 
could be done to help reduce fat 50 percent said change the 
commodity program and 26 percent said provide nutrition education 
public voice recommended that the agriculture department provide 
greater leadership in educating school food service directors and in 
offering assistance in planning monthly menus including suggesting 
how often specific foods should be served 
the usda also should significantly expand the availability of 
lowerfat commodities to the schools the group added 
dunn said it is important to remember that no matter what level 
is deemed appropriate that level must be applied to a persons 
entire diet not to a single food or a single meal usda cannot at 
this time support setting quantitative fat standards or recommended 
frequency of serving certain foods 
the variety of foods donated to schools is under constant review 
he said in a statement adding that over the years significant 
progress has been made in providing more and more healthy wholesome 
foods including additional lowand reducedfat foods 
in addition the agency promotes and coordinates nutrition 
education and technical assistance for all involved in the school 
lunch program he said but states have great flexibility in how 
they spend the money they have available for training 
technical assistance and educational materials have recently 
been revised and distributed to school food service directors 
dunn said these include recipe cards a commodity foods 
newsletter and information on fat and cholesterol

of schools which were closed for much of the 20monthold 
palestinian uprising by allowing 10th and 11th grade students to 
return to class

death tuesday of ismail abu jayyab 27 who was the leader of a 
plobacked students group at the closed islamic university he had 
been jailed four times without charges during the uprising

in several neighborhoods in gaza city which has a population of 
nearly 200000 people the town of deir elbalah where jayyab was 
from also was shut by a strike 
no casualties were reported in the protest but a 39yearold 
municipal worker was shot several times by unknown assailants in

a judge today ordered state officials to 
release a carpenter who has been jailed for 18 months under the 
states 156yearold sodomy law after he admitted having oral sex 
with his wife 
dekalb county superior judge robert castellani ordered the state 
to free james moseley on his own recognizance by 3 pm unless a 
satisfactory reason for keeping him in jail is found 
moseley 35 was convicted in february 1988 on one charge of 
sodomy and sentenced to five years in prison after he testified that 
he engaged in oral sex with bette roberts his commonlaw wife of 
four years the couple have since divorced and ms roberts won 
custody of their two children 
castellani ruled that moseley be freed until it could be 
determined if he should have a new trial or if his conviction should 
be overturned 
moseley of clayton county was charged with two counts of rape 
two counts of aggravated oral sodomy and two counts of aggravated 
anal sodomy in connection with two encounters with ms roberts he 
was acquitted of those charges but a jury found him guilty of 
sodomy because of his admission on the witness stand 
sodomy even between a consenting husband and wife is a felony 
in georgia moseley is believed to be the first man convicted under 
the sodomy law for conduct between marriage partners 
in todays hearing clive stafford smith an attorney for the 
american civil liberties union argued that state prosecutors should 
be required to disqualify themselves from the case if they had 
engaged in oral sex 
castellani declined to order prosecutors to reveal such 
information 
the judge gave moseleys attorneys until tuesday to review 
transcripts from the original trial and to file additional motions 
in the case they were seeking a writ of habeas corpus which if 
granted would void moseleys conviction and free him failing that 
he wants a new trial 
steven e lister moseleys original lawyer testified today that 
he advised moseley not to appeal the conviction because he believed 
an appeal would delay a release from the state board of pardons and 
paroles 
smith argued that listers advice effectively deprived moseley of 
his right to appeal 
senior assistant attorney general mary beth westmoreland said the 
state was not trying to interfere in private marital relations but 
became involved because of ms roberts contention that she did not 
consent to the acts

hotel queen leona helmsley was convicted today of 
tax evasion for charging personal expenses to her businesses but was 
acquitted of the most serious charge against her extortion 
conspiracy 
she was found guilty of 33 of the 41 federal counts on which she 
was tried the counts on which she was convicted related to evading 
12 million in taxes from 1983 to 1985 
mrs helmsley who with her husband runs a multibilliondollar 
real estate empire showed little emotion while the jury foreman 
read off the verdict but occasionally shook her head 
her codefendants former aides frank turco and joseph licari 
were convicted of assisting in the taxevasion scheme turco who 
had been charged in the extortion conspiracy was also acquitted on 
that charge 
all three also were acquitted on mail fraud charges 
each of the 33 counts mrs helmsley was convicted on carries a 
maximum prison term of three or five years she could also face 
fines as high as 8 million the extortion conspiracy charge carried 
a 20year maximum sentence 
mrs helmsley was allowed to remain free on bail pending 
sentencing nov 14 the judge and lawyers went into conference after 
the verdict was announced as she waited mrs helmsley slumped in 
her chair occasionally talking with her bodyguard grandson and 
niece 
mrs helmsley 69 was depicted at the trial as arrogant 
pennypinching and meanspirited her former housekeeper testified 
that mrs helmsley once told her we dont pay taxes only the 
little people pay taxes 
her 80yearold husband harry was charged in the april 1988 
indictment but was not tried because the judge found him mentally 
incompetent 
the verdict came in the fifth day of deliberations in us 
district court 
the bulk of the expenses on which the tax charges were based were 
31 million in renovations and operating costs at the lavish 
greenwich conn mansion dunnellen hall which the helmsleys 
purchased for 11 million in june 1983 
many of the bills were altered to make it appear the work was 
done at corporate entities prosecutors contended that the phony 
bills resulted in unreported income on the helmsleys personal tax 
returns and incorrect business deductions on the corporate returns 
the expenses included more than 1 million for a pool enclosure 
with a marble dance floor on the roof jade figures worth 500000 
a 130000 indooroutdoor sound system similar to one mrs helmsley 
had admired in disney world and thousands of dollars in landscaping 
work 
the prosecution also alleged that 320172 in mrs helmsleys 
personal purchases were charged to the park lane hotel one of 
several luxury helmsley hotels in manhattan 
these items ranged from tens of thousands of dollars in designer 
clothing to an 8 purchase of underwear another item was a 45000 
silver clock specially designed in the shape of the helmsley 
building a birthday present to helmsley from his wife 
during the trial the hotels former comptroller quoted turco as 
saying the accounting system at the park lane was the helmsley 
cheatthegovernment system 
the extortion conspiracy charge alleged that three liquor sales 
representatives were forced to kick back a percentage of their sales 
to keep accounts at helmsley hotels 
a former helmsley executive milton meckler testified that turco 
once held up several envelopes and said this is cash this is 
what mrs helmsley wants 
the extortion charge also covered three televisions for dunnellen 
hall that were allegedly extorted from the rca corp while it was 
seeking a lucrative contract with her clevelandbased harley hotel 
chain 
meckler testified that mrs helmsley joked with him how many 
more can i get 
many of the 44 prosecution witnesses helped paint the harsh 
personal portrait of mrs helmsley that emerged during the 
eightweek trial 
they described how she fired employees at the slightest 
provocation disputed bills and always sought the lowest price 
defense attorney gerald feffer attempted to discredit the 
witnesses as disgruntled exemployees who had a vendetta against 
mrs helmsley whom he described as tough and abrasive 
feffer had argued that the helmsleys did nothing wrong in billing 
their companies for part of the expenses at dunnellen hall because 
they used the estate for business 
he tried to explain away the phony bills by saying her employees 
devised the scheme to avoid contact with mrs helmsley who many 
times refused to pay contractors if she was not fully satisfied with 
their work 
feffer had repeatedly pointed out that the helmsleys paid 578 
million in taxes during the time period of the indictment 
the defense presented testimony from four witnesses including 
two tax experts who said the helmsleys actually overpaid 591000 in 
federal taxes in 198385 by underreporting the depreciation of 
buildings in helmsleycontrolled partnerships

two passenger trains collided headon in 
western austria today killing at least one person and injuring 27 
people a railway spokesman said 
three cars derailed when the trains crashed while traveling at 
relatively low speeds between bregenz capital of voralberg 
province and the small town of wolfurt the spokesman said 
authorities found one body in the wreckage the austria press 
agency identified the victim as alfred rainer heller a 48yearold 
engineer from bodolz west germany 
sixteen people including the drivers of each train were 
hospitalized and 11 other people treated for slight injuries a 
railroad spokesman on condition of anonymity 
the spokesman said 72 passengers were on the montfort the 
express train between bregenz and vienna and 75 were on the 
bavaria the express train between munich and zurich 
the railway spokesman said it seemed that human error was 
probably to blame since the montfort had been erroneously 
switched to the same track as the other train 
the crash occurred in voralberg near the site of a train accident 
that killed five people and injured 46 exactly one year ago on aug

researchers at carnegie mellon university say 
they have bad news for international chess grandmaster gary kasparov 
computers could overtake the best human players in just a few 
years 
id say four years is a very generous estimate in fact said 
cmu computer scientist hans berliner the brains behind hitech a 
computer that won its third straight pennsylvania state championship 
over the weekend in lancaster 
hitechs fivegame sweep at the tournament raised its us chess 
federation ranking to 2411 up about 400 points from the rating it 
achieved after it began playing in 1985 
kasparov the world champion ranks above 2800 a beginner 
typically rates about 1200 
hitech is winning about 80 percent of its games and ranks among 
the top 150 players in the united states but never has beaten a 
grandmaster the federations highest rank 
berliner and a changing team of graduate students have worked 
since 1985 to boost hitechs speed and ability 
any person who can improve 100 points a year will probably 
become a world champion very soon berliner said tuesday 
getting up to 2000 is not something many players achieve 
hitech isnt even the fastest or most powerful chess computer it 
ranks second in the world behind another carnegie mellon creation 
deep thought berliner said 
its becoming fairly obvious that deep thought which is 20 
times faster than hitech already can play with the best players in 
the country its not going to take too much more improvement he 
said 
many of the best human chess players are turning down invitations 
to match wits against machines in tournament play however 
four of the players seeded above sixthseeded hitech declined to 
play the computer at the state championship the fifth person lost 
participants in tournaments dont have to play a computer if they 
dont want to 
when we were first being invited to play it was for fun 
nobody expected it to win berliner said but he added players 
are starting to refuse to play because its no longer an easy 
touch 
the best human players rely on experience intuition and 
knowledge of chess theory 
computers play mathematically computing the consequences of 
various moves hitech can consider more than 175000 board positions 
per second before picking the best one hitech also can recognize 
patterns of moves 
computer chess is advancing the field of artificial intelligence 
and lessons learned could help humans make complex judgments in 
other areas of life berliner said 
when they invented the steam shovel the people who dug ditches 
also were very upset he said but look at what a great 
improvement that turned out to be

algeria and pakistan are blocking israels attempt 
to join an international conference on chemical weapons an israeli 
diplomat said today 
israel in june submitted its application to join the 40nation 
conference on disarmament which officially accepts new participants 
only by consensus the conference concludes its summer session 
thursday 
pinhas eliav israels ambassador to the united nations in 
geneva said officials told him that algeria helped to a certain 
degree by pakistan opposed israels bid for observer status the 
two other arab members egypt and morocco did not raise objections 
he added 
the request still is pending and israel plans to pursue it when 
delegates reconvene in february 
we didnt want to press it too much because we didnt think it 
was worth it eliav told the associated press we didnt want to 
fight it out 
israeli officials say one reason for the application is concern 
over the spread of chemical weapons in the middle east 
western diplomats will lobby arab delegations in the conference 
recess in an effort to obtain a consensus because it would not be 
productive to force the issue to a vote now us ambassador max 
friedersdorf said 
eliav suggested algeria was retaliating for israeli and western 
moves to keep the palestine liberation organization from gaining 
full membership in international organizations 
among the 22 nonmembers participating in the chemical weapons 
talks are iraq syria and libya all believed to have chemical arms 
capabilities israel is believed to have stocks of nerve gas and 
mustard gas 
the disarmament conference has been debating a global convention 
outlawing the production stockpiling and use of chemical arms 
several new observers joined this year after a special 149nation 
conference on chemical weapons in paris attempted to spur the 
negotiations on a draft treaty 
delegates on tuesday reported that the latest round made progress 
on technical points but again failed to remove major stumbling 
blocks including disagreements over verification

widespread thievery has deprived chinese officials 
of one of their most treasured privileges access to telephones that 
work 
the workers daily said wednesday that 420 miles of telephone 
line have been stolen this year in the southern island province of

an unpublished british report rejects testimony 
by austrian president kurt waldheim to the justice department and 
includes a secret cia file which identifies waldheim as a nazi 
intelligence officer the world jewish congress said wednesday 
the british defense ministry announced tuesday that the report 
ordered by prime minister margaret thatcher to determine whether 
waldheim was linked to the execution of six british commandos in 
world war ii will be released in a few weeks 
speculation has arisen in london that some evidence may be 
suppressed because of possible postwar links between waldheim and 
british and us intelligence services 
but world jewish congress executive director elan steinberg said 
he has learned the report will include a cia file of april 26 1945 
which contains an interrogation conducted by british military 
intelligence of a nazi officer who identified waldheim as an 
intelligence officer 
steinbergs organization found out about the file by petitioning 
the cia under the freedom of information act but he said that the 
agency refused to release the document because it was obtained from 
british intelligence 
the file proves that british and us authorities knew about 
waldheims nazi past when they supported his nomination for un 
secretary general in the 1970s he added 
waldheim was elected president in 1986 and placed on a list of 
undesirable foreigners by the justice department which found he had 
assisted and otherwise participated in deportation of jewish 
prisoners to death camps and execution of allied prisoners 
an international commission of historians appointed by the 
austrian government found waldheim lied about his activities in 
world war ii and knew about nazi atrocities but did nothing to stop 
them 
the commission said it could not prove a connection between 
waldheim and the british commandos captured in the balans in 1944 
but suggested he knew they were shot by the gestapo after their 
interrogation by nazi intelligence officers 
in written testimony presented by his lawyers to the justice 
department waldheim denied taking part in any interrogations 
saying no questioning of prisoners was conducted at the field 
headquarters where he was stationed near the greek town of saloniki 
but the british report shows the commandos were interrogated at 
the headquarters where waldheim served and that some of them were 
subsequently handed over to the gestapo for special handling 
the euphemism for execution steinberg said 
among documents made available to the british investigation are 
papers with waldheims initials showing he was clearly aware the 
commandos were handed over to the gestapo steinberg said 
he said the world jewish congress had gleaned its information 
about the british report from documents it had supplied at the 
investigators request and from people who have seen the completed 
findings 
the report will not make any judgment of criminality about 
waldheims activities steinberg said

bakkers fraud and conspiracy trial collapsed on the stand today 
during questioning and court was recessed for the day after 
paramedics carried him out on a stretcher 
steve nelson a former ptl executive had testified before

partnerships that he warned bakker and former aide richard dortch 
that they could go to prison for the programs 
the partnership programs promised donors three nights of free 
lodging each year for life in exchange for 1000 donations to ptl 
i told them i thought we had some bigtime problems said 
nelson i specifically said someone could go to jail for this 
dortch responded that ptl officials had checked out the 
partnership programs with south carolina officials and were assured 
that no laws had been broken said nelson who became ptls vice 
president for world outreach in 1985 
during cross examination nelson collapsed on the stand and fell 
to the floor a member of the jury and an artist from the press 
section rushed to help him 
bakker sat at the defense table until his attorney called him 
over to nelsons side bakker appeared to be praying over nelson 
who quickly regained consciousness 
sue patterson the courtroom artist who came to nelsons aid 
said he told her he hadnt eaten in several days after paramedics 
took nelson away on a stretcher us district judge robert potter 
recessed court for the day 
bakker is on trial on federal charges of fraud and conspiracy 
prosecutors say he and other ptl executives diverted more than 4 
million of the 158 million raised through partnership programs to 
their own uses 
dortch 57 agreed on aug 8 to plead guilty to two counts of 
wire fraud and one count each of mail fraud and conspiracy the plea 
bargain came three weeks before he was scheduled to stand trial with 
bakker dortch was sentenced aug 24 to eight years in prison and 
fined 200000

his condition 
robert dash of the us attorneys office refused to discuss the 
effects of dortchs hospitalization on the proceedings he said 
dortch was not expected to be called this week 
prosecution witnesses tuesday portrayed jim bakker as an 
evangelist of extravagance but attorneys for the ptl founder say he 
was a busy minister concerned with saving souls 
david taggart a former aide to bakker convicted of tax evasion 
testified that the televangelist pursued an extravagant lifestyle 
and was enchanted with real estate 
he told me he wanted to have 10 homes taggart said 
hollis rule a former computer programmer for ptl testified he 
went to his superiors with concerns that the partnerships were 
oversold numbering 64000 in september 1985 despite bakkers 
selfimposed limit of 25000 
richard ball a ptl vice president testified he relayed those 
concerns to bakker and another executive during a brief meeting at 
the ministrys television studio 
they told me not to worry about it ball said 
former ptl advertising writer lois chalmers testified that a 
campaign for the partnerships offered a david and goliath sculpture 
said to be worth 1000 but the ministry only paid 10 for them 
she said a silver version of the sculpture in bakkers office might 
have been worth 1000 she said

board even after objecting to them the board in 1985 approved 
borrowing 800000 for operating expenses while voting bakker a 
200000 bonus taggart said

he lived shabbily compared to oral roberts the rex humbards and 
other ministers 
taggart said electric bills at bakkers lakefront parsonage in 
tega cay sc usually ran about 1800 to 2000 a month because 
the pool was kept at a very high temperature in the 90s 
the witness also recounted moving the bakkers clothing and other 
belongings in 1984 from tega cay to a house they owned in palm 
springs calif he said the move was made on a private jet at a cost 
to ptl of 105000 
after the charlotte observer reported on the bakkers extravagant 
homes vacations and vintage cars ptl hired a private investigator 
for at least 5000 to follow the newspapers publisher editor and 
a reporter charles e shepard the newspaper won a pulitzer prize 
for its reporting and shepard has a book coming out next month on 
the rise and fall of bakker and his ministry 
bakker quit ptl in 1987 amid revelations about his 1980 sexual

king henry viii renowned for his appetite for 
women and power was killed by his craving for meat a historian has 
concluded 
susan maclean kybett writing in the september issue of history 
today argues that henry died in 1547 of scurvy a disease caused by 
a lack of fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin c 
or as the headline in wednesdays guardian newspaper put it 
henry was a scurvy knave 
the king ms kybett said displayed a number of symptoms of 
scurvy swollen ulcerated legs bad breath frequent colds 
constipation lethargy forgetfulness bloating and wild mood swings 
it could have been henry she wrote that the elizabethan writer 
phillip stubbes had in mind in this blast against the english diet 
for who is sicklier than they that fare deliciously every day 
who is corrupter who belcheth more who looketh worse who is 
weaker and feebler than they who hath more filthy colour phlegm 
and putrifaction replete with gross humours than they 
and to be brief who dyeth sooner than they 
significantly henry was usually sick during lent when fasting 
coincided with a lack of nutritious food ms kybett wrote 
but nobody in the tudor era associated foods with health they 
hoped in vain that the green and golden concoctions of the alchemist 
would bring a cure 
it was once believed that henry who died at age 56 succumbed to 
syphilis but that theory has been discredited 
a cure for scurvy was unknown until dr james lind of scotland 
published a treatment of the scurvy in 1735 
sailors were frequent sufferers from scurvy until it was 
discovered that they could be protected by citrus fruits hence the 
term limey for british from the lime juice rations that were 
given to seamen 
ms kybett a native of scotland who lives in jackson mich 
said that the english of henrys time had no techniques for 
preserving fruits and vegetables 
nicander nucius an italian who visited england in the last two 
years of henrys life commented on the sottish and unrestrained 
appetites of the natives and another italian at the time remarked 
that fruit was scarce because they lack the great heat of 
summer

an artist boycott has forced the cancellation 
of two scheduled exhibitions at the corcoran gallery which in june 
amid a swirling political controversy abruptly canceled a show that 
included sexually explicit photos 
gallery officials said wednesday that contemporary artist annette 
lemieux has withdrawn her onewoman show scheduled for oct 28 to 
dec 31 and that an exhibit by six sculptors scheduled for next feb 
3 to april 8 also has been indefinitely postponed 
were hoping to reschedule both at some point said deborah 
shriver a spokeswoman for the private gallery which has been 
trying in recent years to establish itself as a showcase for 
contemporary art 
ms lemieux whose work was subsidized by the federal government 
through the national endowment of the arts described the withdrawal 
of her show as a indefinite postponement until they the 
corcoran demonstrate a definite change in policy 
both she and two of the six sculptors said in letters to the 
gallery their decisions were based on the corcorans cancellation in 
june of an exhibit of 150 photographs by the late robert 
mapplethorpe who died last march from aids 
we believe the corcoran by its regrettable decision not only 
compromised its own curatorial standards but also demonstrated it 
complicity with the punishment subsequently attempted against other 
art instititions wrote sculptors buss spector and donald lipski 
the mapplethrope exhibit which included photographs of 
childrens genitalia homoerotic and sadomasochistic images became 
embroiled in a vehement controversy over the federal funding of 
sexually explicit art through the national endowment of the arts 
the exhibit which toured several other museums was funded 
partially through a 15000 grant by the endowment 
since then congressional critics led by sen jesse helms 
rnc and rep dick armey rtexas have pushed bills through the 
house and senate cutting the endowments budget and restricting the 
type of art it can fund 
this is what we feared from day one christina orrcahall 
the corcorans director told the washington post were in the 
middle of the storm 
ms shriver said 10 american painters including ms lemieux 
featured in a joint ussoviet exhibition to be featured next 
spring also have threatened to deny the gallery the right to display 
their work 
as far as we know that show is still on she said of the 
spring 1990 exhibit 10 plus 10 contemporary soviet and american 
painters a touring show arranged by the modern art museum of fort 
worth but we realize that the artists are upset

delegates at an international conference on cambodia 
failed to produce a peace accord today and decided to suspend their 
work until the warring factions are ready to compromise 
lastminute haggling delayed by seven hours the issuing of a 
final statement that fell far short of the comprehensive settlement 
delegates from 19 nations hoped to achieve when the meeting opened 
in late july 
the statement issued as the delegates began a last plenary 
session that was expected to be brief said the meeting had 
achieved progress in elaborating a wide variety of elements 
necessary for the reaching of a comprehensive settlement to the 
tragic conflict in cambodia 
but it added it is not yet possible to achieve a 
comprehensive settlement it was therefore decided to suspend the 
conference 
france and indonesia whose representatives chaired the meeting 
offered to assist in mediating within the next six months between 
the vietnaminstalled government of prime minister hun sen and the 
three resistance factions led by prince norodom sihanouk the 
hereditary ruler of the southeast asian nation 
the delegates left open the possiblity of using the committees 
set up under the auspices of the international conference as a forum 
for future talks between the belligerents 
france and indonesia will begin consultations within six months 
with the participants in the conference with a view to reconvening 
the conference the statement said 
france called the conference when it appeared that an 
international political climate of greater cooperation favored a 
possible settlement 
but over three weeks of negotiations in small working groups the 
positions among the cambodian factions hardened 
the failure at the negotiating table in paris increased the 
liklihood of fullscale civil war after the scheduled withdrawal of 
26000 vietnamese troops before sept 27 some delegates said 
it will be like afghanistan there will be more fighting 
said the spokesman for the singapore delegation tommy koh the 
two sides are preparing for war theyre already fighting 
the parties wont come back until theyve tested each other on 
the battlefield and have reached an impasse koh said 
negotiations broke down over five points including the 
composition of a transitional government after the troop pullout a 
mechanism for monitoring the withdrawal and the use of the word 
genocide in describing the khmer rouge rule between 1975 and the 
vietnamese invasion three years later french foreign minister 
roland dumas reported the khmer rouge is believed to have killed 1 
million cambodians during its rule 
intransigence marked the meeting up until the end delaying the 
final plenary session that was scheduled to begin in the morning but 
was delayed until late afternoon 
the points of disagreement included an item in a draft of the 
final statement calling for the cambodian parties to intensify their 
efforts to achieve national reconciliation 
both china who supports the khmer rouge resistance and sihanouk 
objected to the reference national reconciliation and the wording 
was deleted 
their position remains that the phnom penh government led by hun 
sen is strictly a vietnamese puppet 
in a statement released on the last day of the conference 
sihanouk said that the resistance would reject any international 
monitoring of the troop withdrawal before the dismantling of the 
illegal regime of phnom penh and its replacement by a cambodian 
provisional quadrapartite government composed of the three 
resistance members and hun sen

president bush promised today to keep 
trying to hold the line on taxes and to fight for a lower tax on 
capital gains 
speaking to an appreciative audience of fellow residents and 
merchants of this summer resort the vacationing president appealed 
for their support as he heads back to washington next week to 
grapple with congress over taxes and the deficit 
bush later in the day was welcoming canadian prime minister brian 
mulroney and family to his oceanfront home where he has spent the 
past two weeks 
bush standing on a bluedraped temporary platform erected on a 
hotel shuffleboard court with the rocky coastline and blue waters 
of the atlantic at his back noted that the kennebunkkennebunkport 
chamber of commerce was composed of a lot of entrepreneurs 
id be remiss at a meeting like this if i didnt ask you to 
give me strong support as i go back to washington to fight for a 
capital gains tax differential he said 
bush wants to reduce the levy on capital gains profits made 
from the sale of property or securities from 28 percent to 15 
percent but has met resistence from democrats who control congress 
calling small businesses the backbone of this country in any 
ways bush said he wants to reduce the levy to stimulate the 
economy and reward those who have the courage to go off on their 
own and start new businesses 
i do believe were going to get a good agreement on the budget 
deficit reduction package i think it will be accomplished without 
raising the taxes on the american working man the president said 
i am going to continue to try to hold the line on taxes he 
told the crowd of several hundred 
bush made no apologies for his 20day vacation which ends on 
labor day 
we are doing some work but i have confessed at the very outset 
that this is a pure total vacation and im not going to look busy 
in order to convince people in america that its something other 
than a vacation he said to applause its the way it is 
bush also said he planned to call the editor of the portland 
press herald and ask him to stop running a graphic chronicling his 
futility at fishing 
he said this morning he was at the helm when a companion caught a 
bluefish 
i think they should knock off that advertisement on the front 
of the portland paper that shows a bluefish with a big x through 
it telling me that yet a 13th day i havent caught one he said 
im going to appeal to them on that one 
the president said this was a place where he and barbara 
refurbish our souls and get our batteries all charged up and enjoy 
life really to the fullest 
bush has spent every summer of his life here except 1944 when he 
was flying navy bombers in the pacific during world war ii 
a bright sun broke through the morning haze and clouds in time 
for the chamber of commerce event 
i cant wait to show off this heaven to the prime minister of 
canada his wife and his four kids he told the local boosters 
bushs national security adviser said tuesday that uscanadian 
relations are in good shape thanks to progress on acid rain and 
trade as the two leaders hold their friendly private visit 
mulroney his wife mila and their four children were to arrive in 
late afternoon at bushs walkers point compound for an overnight 
visit 
bushs national security adviser brent scowcroft said tuesday 
the private visit would give the two leaders a chance to relax 
and a chance to exchange views on world events including the 
dramatic changes in poland as well as the crises in lebanon and 
colombia 
scowcroft said the two old friends share a close similarity of 
views on world affairs and a kind of unique personal closeness 
and frankness in exchanging views 
scowcroft said uscanadian ties are in basically pretty good 
shape with efforts under way to implement the sweeping free trade 
agreement signed last year by former president reagan and mulroney 
he said bushs proposed revision of the clean air act which 
would seek to sharply curb emissions from utility plants factories 
and other sources of pollutants that cause acid rain has set us 
on the road to dealing with one of the other major problems between 
us that is the issue of crossborder pollution such as acid rain

owatonna minn peoples press on education 
us education secretary lauro cavazos did not actually point an 
accusing finger at educators and schools when he complained of 
rising education costs and falling returns 
he was careful to say parents teachers and all americans must 
become involved if education is to succeed 
but his underlying tone was an accusatory one once again he 
implied education is falling down on the job 
if cavazos genuinely believes such a direct relationship can be 
discerned between money spent on education and childrens 
achievement he does not understand how people learn 
it is not the fault of the education system that families break 
apart and create insecure homes for kids keeping their minds off 
learning it is not the fault of the educational system that 
children are abused throwing up barriers to learning it is not the 
fault of the educational system that teenagers get pregnant and to 
compound the problem try to raise their babies themselves in 
poverty 
a failure in education is a failure in society as a whole we 
cannot mend our school system until we mend our social failings it 
is a cyclical relationship to a large degree education is the 
answer to our social failings 
the circuit breaker we need is in the cycle of poverty and crime 
not in the money we spend on education 
then again it is possible that cavazos realizes these 
complexities if so he is playing politics with childrens futures 
and that is unforgivable

the news tribune woodbridge nj on the cost of azt 
the encouraging news that the drug azt will stall the deadly 
effect of the aids virus is dampened by the news that the bill for 
this drug might approach 5 billion annually 
should limited public funds be used to help these patients with 
their terminal virus or should they be used to help poor women get 
proper prenatal care or allow poor schoolchildren hot lunches 
providing azt to all who need it regardless of their ability to 
pay is the compassionate thing to do but is it fiscally 
responsible to do so in a nation with a mounting debt and an 
exploding health bill 
what this dilemma does is offer an additional reminder that 
massive education and changes in habits are needed to prevent the 
spread of this preventable disease it also highlights the need for 
research to find a cure for aids as well as the need for discovery 
of affordable means of treatment

picayune miss item on voyager 2 
twelve long years and billions of miles after launching the 
plucky voyager spacecraft rendezvoused with the distant planet 
neptune sending back a wealth of spectacular pictures and other 
information it was a dramatic climax to a remarkable mission 
this is technology at its best technology often gets a bum rap 
these days people ask why we should spend so much on such 
adventures when there are so many problems here on earth 
voyager tells us why we want to know whats there over the next 
hill mankind always has maybe what we find will be good or 
beneficial maybe it wont but we dont know till we look till we 
use our human resources to invent to dream to venture beyond our 
safe little backyards 
the desolation of the other planets that voyager has so 
graphically shown us has been a lesson in itself our earth is a 
special place a unique oasis of beauty and knowledge in the 
vastness of space 
we must preserve it to be sure but we must also make the most 
of what we have always thankful for our blessings always willing 
to use them

protesters blocked railroad tracks and 
battled police during nationwide demonstrations wednesday against 
prime minister rajiv gandhi officials said 11 people were killed 
and more than 100000 arrested 
the nationwide strike shut down commerce and transportation in 
six states controlled by opposition parties but had less effect in 
the 19 states governed by gandhis congress party press trust of 
india said 
several clashes broke out between government supporters and 
opposition demonstrators and at least four people died when a bomb 
was thrown at a bus police said police used batons and tear gas to 
break up crowds nationwide news reports said 
at least 80 people were injured and 103450 were arrested 
nationwide police said 
opposition parties had called the strikes to focus attention on 
alleged government corruption gandhi must call new parliamentary 
elections later this year and the strike has been perceived as being 
the start of the oppositions campaign 
the strike closed shops businesses and schools and stopped rail 
and transport services in the six oppositiongovernment states in 
other regions it evoked only a limited response although there was 
a drop in business activity and attendance at schools colleges and 
offices 
about 2700 people including 16 lawmakers were arrested for 
sitting on railroad tracks to block trains in southern tamil nadu 
state police said 
press trust said at least 11 people were killed in clashes 
involving police and pro and antigovernment factions it said 
seven deaths were reported from the northeastern state of tripura 
which borders bangladesh in fighting between members of the 
congress party and the marxist communist party 
four people were killed in the states of kerala and west bengal 
both governed by the marxist communist party it said 
vp singh the leader of an opposition coalition trying to unite 
political groups against gandhi said the strike was a success 
we are very confident of the future he said at a news 
conference 
singhs national front had called the strike and was supported by 
the marxist communist party the communist party of india and the 
rightwing indian peoples party 
federal home minister buta singh claimed the strike failed and 
that the forces that inspired it have been decisively defeated 
he said that except in the oppositionruled states citizens 
rejected the strike call and federal government organizations 
nationwide functioned normally 
in new delhi thousands of government employees slept in their 
offices tuesday night so they could report to work on wednesday the 
government had threatened not to pay them the days salary if they 
missed work 
food and bedrolls were provided for employees and senior 
executives were given rooms in luxury hotels said officials who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the strike brought to a climax the oppositions campaign against 
alleged corruption in the government last month 106 opposition 
members in parliament resigned saying a government audit into a 
controversial arms deal proved kickbacks were paid to senior 
officials and gandhis party 
opposition leaders say a swedish company ab bofors paid 50 
million in kickbacks and bribes to secure a 14 billion contract to 
supply artillery guns to the indian army the government denies the 
charge 
parliamentary elections must be called before january 
the strike was a rare show of unity for the normally fractured 
opposition 
gandhis congress party won 415 out of the 544 parliamentary 
seats in the last general elections in 1985 political analysts say 
any chance the opposition could have for winning the next election 
lies in its ability to put up concensus candidates and avoid 
splitting the anticongress vote 
the only time the congress has lost an election in independent 
india was when the opposition united in 1977 but that government 
fell apart less than three years later when the fragile coalition 
splintered

two small planes collided in flight and 
crashed one bursting into flames and all four people on board were 
killed authorities said 
searchers combed the area today for clues to the cause of the 
crash which occurred about 8 pm tuesday about a mile west of 
harvey field near the small puget soundarea town of snohomish 
elsewhere a small plane crashed in front of a trailer park in 
moose lake minn tuesday night killing the pilot and a passenger 
no one on the ground was believed injured 
in the washington crash faa duty officer gini bright in seattle 
said the planes were a beechcraft bonanza be35 vtail with 
three occupants and a cessna 152 carrying only the pilot 
errol van eaton a federal aviation administration investigator 
said it appeared that the bonanza had left paine field at everett 
five miles away earlier in the day and was returning when the 
accident took place 
it would appear that one was climbing and one was 
descending and they failed to observe each other van eaton said 
the planes werent under direction of air traffic controllers 
and the pilots were responsible for watching for other craft he 
said adding that the weather was clear 
this is the worst possible mix a highwing cessna cannot see 
up and the bonanza is a low wing and cant see below we dont know 
yet which was on top but if history is any indicator it worked 
that way 
van eaton said the cessna is owned by snohomish flying service at 
harvey and the bonanza kept at paine is owned by richard kehew of 
edmonds officials have not yet determined who was flying the planes 
the names of the dead were not immediately available said 
snohomish county sheriffs dispatch superviser lonnie davis 
one of the planes came close to hitting a horse barn while the 
second plane hit the ground several hundred yards away said 
snohomish county sheriffs office spokeswoman jan jorgensen 
the beechcraft burst into flames on impact the cessna did not 
she said 
the national transportation safety board was also investigating 
the minnesota crash took place about 740 pm tuesday on a road 
in front of the don bean trailer park said dispatcher lynn parnin 
of the carlton county sheriffs department

an american airlines jet made an emergency

failed an airline spokesman said 
flight 891 carrying 66 passengers and a crew of six from 
oklahoma city to dallas returned to will rogers world airport 11 
minutes after taking off said american spokesman jim brown 
he said the loss of any one or two of the hydraulic systems would 
not result in the pilot losing control of the airplane as happened 
with a dc10 that crashed at sioux city iowa after losing all 
three of its hydraulic systems 
i want to emphasize this kind of airplane has a hydraulically 
assisted flight control system but even if all three hydraulic 
systems went out there would be a cable system to pilot the 
aircraft brown said 
brown said mechanics would inspect the plane a mcdonnell douglas 
md80 to determine if it should be taken out of service and the 
passengers transferred to other flights

the registerguard eugene ore on colombias drug crackdown 
political leaders in the united states often speak of the need 
for a war against drugs but in colombia theyre fighting the real 
thing 
colombia is under violent siege by powerful narcotics 
traffickers and the killings there are directly traceable to the 
failure to control the drug problem here 
the united states is being less effective than it needs to be in 
its efforts to help colombian society withstand the cartels corrupt 
and violent influence 
us economic aid to colombia has been cut and military aid 
ended last year meanwhile ghetto addicts and yuppie thrillseekers 
finance the private armies of the cartel 
those who stand up to the drug lords in colombia are valuable 
allies and when such allies are killed it underscores the 
united states responsibility to do more to curtail the demand for 
drugs which is the assasins ultimate source of strength

south bend ind tribune on voyager 2 
if you yawned it had to be the hour not the event not since our 
distant ancestors emerged from the caves has humankind been treated 
to such sights 
the marvelous journey of voyager 2 to the edge of the solar 
system humbled and excited at the same time as great human 
achievements have always done 
the pictures of neptune and its mysterious moons may have lacked 
the clarity of a telecast game show but they were vivid testimony 
of what man can do in his better moments what scientists have 
dreamed about for decades was delivered to you on your own tv 
screen 
putting it all in perspective will take time drama aside the 
information supplied by voyager 2 is of enormous value in our 
understanding of the universe 
the thousands of scientists and technicians involved in the 
voyager expedition deserve a warm salute from those of us who sit 
wondering in front of the tube 
as it sinks in we can be permitted to wonder about this strange 
creature called man we can reach out to the stars we can eliminate 
a scourge such as polio but tolerate war and hunger 
if we can do some great things why not others

the arizona republic phoenix on the federal reserves 
independence 
it is billed as an effort to put an end to secrecy in the federal 
reserve system but that is window dressing 
the fact is that a bill introduced by rep lee hamilton of 
indiana would factor raw politics into the financial equations of 
the fed creating nothing short of economic pandemonium 
hamilton and other critics complain that like the us supreme 
court the fed is autonomous guided by a handful of appointed 
experts it moves interest rates up and down as it pleases it is 
accountable to no one its deliberations are conducted in secret 
its decisions may not be appealed 
all that is true and let us be grateful the alternative at 
least the alternative favored by hamilton is to authorize the 
congressionally run general accounting office to audit the feds 
monetary transactions which are now protected from such scrutiny 
and recommend changes 
it is not difficult to see how this would give congress whose 
impulses are unfailingly political leverage over the feds 
decisions 
hamilton also wants to make the treasury secretary a voting 
member of the fed thereby enhancing white house influence too 
in justification he argues that the feds monetary policy is not 
democratic enough of course it isnt democratic it is not supposed 
to be democratic the genius of the federal reserve is precisely 
that it insulates monetary decisions from politics 
the purpose of the hamilton bill is as plain as it is alarming 
hamilton hopes to undermine the independence of the federal 
reserve the economys chief protection against a freewheeling 
freespending politically driven congress the mechanism may not be 
perfect but it works 
only at our enormous peril will congress be permitted to 
adjust it

the clarksburg wva exponent on the kingleland legacies

radically different lives one was a clergyman the other a 
politician yet both served humanity with an identically relentless 
love 
today a national holiday enshrines the transfiguring legacy of

whether america will carry out the legacy of rep mickey leland in 
the aftermath of his tragic death in ethiopia 
we are a nation that thrives on the empty grandeur of symbols it 
is far more convenient to erect a graven image to the prophet than 
to adopt his philosophy after king died we named streets 
buildings and schools after him twentyone years later those 
schools are more likely to be completely segregated 
like king leland believed one should live his religious 
convictions like king he suffered an untimely death while 
searching for peace 
unlike many of his colleagues leland did not believe in 
traveling abroad on junkets camouflaged as legislative oversight 
missions to luxuriate in the worlds best hotels and savor 
the food at its most elegant restaurants 
instead of flying to paris leland flew into ethiopias foggy 
mountainous terrain to visit dirtpoor refugee camps 
but we do what mickey leland deplored extolling him with words 
instead of exploring legislative ways to carry out his ideals 
the only monuments leland would care about would be for this 
nation to make a commitment to feeding the hungry preventing the 
erosion of civil rights at home and seeking the sovereign dignity 
for all peoples abroad

philadelphia inquirer on the legal services corp 
president reagans war against legal services to the poor should 
have ended when he left office but it didnt unfortunately the 
people he chose are still running the legal services corp which 
passes federal funds to agencies that represent poor people in 
litigation 
as president bush has dallied in nominating people to fill the 
11 seats on the lscs board of directors the lame ducks now in 
charge have continued to discredit themselves 
several months ago the lsc hired an outside lawyer to produce a 
10page legal memorandum that argued weakly that the legal 
services corp itself is unconstitutional this continued the 
tradition of reaganera embarrassments which included lucrative 
consulting contracts for some lsc leaders 
if bush longs to rekindle the extremism of the reagan era he 
could simply choose some of the 11 potential directors put forward 
by phyllis schlafly howard phillips and other fringedwellers 
but if he backs the premise of the legal services corp that 
every american has the right to effective legal representation 
he will fill those seats with outstanding americans whose own work 
has shown their commitment to legal services to the poor

the jackson mich citizen patriot on indian remains 
american indians have a bone to pick with one of the white mans 
cultural institutions the museum 
meeting in albuquerque nm recently the national congress of 
american indians estimated that the bones of 25 million of their 
ancestors are held in us museums those remains should be 
returned indians say 
museum officials put the figures at much less they admit to 
having the remains of between 100000 and 250000 indians indeed 
the smithsonian institution in washington dc has 18600 indian 
remains stacked in boxes in a hallway closed to the public 
we dont want to refight old wars but heres a thought to 
ponder numbers of remains aside if those were the bones of 
american slaves would the museums get away with this of course not 
what then makes it ok to unearth the remains of indian 
ancestors and bury them in display cases and boxes as an 
anthropological curiosity because we beat the red man because 
to the victor go the spoils 
sometimes were not sure the right side won

daily register portage wis on tranquilizing bears 
the new mexico department of game and fish encountered harsh 
criticism from animal rights advocates and the public in general 
after an incident in which a bear tranquilized after climbing a 
utility pole came in contact with live wires and fell to the ground 
and well it should 
the agency whose primary purpose is to maintain guidelines to 
ensure the survival of fish and game including bear did not seem 
to consider this when tranquilizing the bear which had climbed the 
pole after wandering into a town in search of its cub 
after the bear climbed up the pole the agencys first step 
should have been to cut electrical power 
next it should have prepared for the bears fall in the form 
of a safety net if the bear fell after being shot with the 
tranquilizer gun 
instead the state agency did neither the result was a 25foot 
fall and contact with transformer coils in the form of 7200 
volts 
the bear survived thankfully 
a game and fish department official after getting a host of 
calls criticizing the methods said the agency was only concerned 
about the safety of residents so much for its mission of ensuring 
the survival of fish and game

japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu 
arrived today on a trip designed to foster closer ties and establish 
the diplomatic credentials of his new adminstration 
during his first overseas trip since taking office aug 9 kaifu 
hopes to use baseball diplomacy and meetings with us officials and 
academics to ease trade tensions between america and japan foreign 
ministry officials said 
kaifu was greeted here this morning by nobuo matsunaga japanese 
ambassador to the united states shunji yanai japanese consul 
general in san francisco and several local officials 
kaifu 58 is not expected to propose any major trade or 
diplomatic initiatives in his talks friday with president bush 
but he hopes to establish a close and credible working 
relationship with the president and other american leaders said 
yukio okamoto director of the foreign ministrys first north 
america division 
kaifu also will use the 12day tour which will take him to 
mexico on sept 46 and to canada sept 7 to enhance his stature at 
home analysts say 
kaifu who has little diplomatic experience but is considered an 
excellent speaker will address scholars and journalists in san 
francisco washington and boston where he plans to watch a red sox 
baseball game from the owners box 
mr kaifu wants to initiate a much more increased level of 
intellectual dialogue with the united states and especially with 
its people okamoto said 
in their meeting kaifu and bush are expected to talk about 
socalled structural problems that impede an improvement in the us 
trade deficit with japan which totaled 55 billion in 1988 
according to us figures 
kaifu is expected to explain japans efforts to reduce the trade 
imbalance and express its willingness to focus on issues like its 
complex distribution system and business practices that americans 
say block foreign access to the japanese market 
but the prime minister also will emphasize the need for the 
united states to address problems such as its large budget deficit 
and low investment rate foreign ministry officials say 
usjapanese talks on such nontariff trade barriers are 
scheduled to begin sept 4 but kaifus liberal democratic party is 
under strong pressure at home not to make additional concessions on 
trade 
recent election losses suffered by the party were attributed in 
part to the unhappiness of farmers over japanese concessions on 
agricultural trade 
it will take a long time to solve the trade imbalance and in 
the meantime we have to live with it a ministry official said 
to defuse the tension caused by the imbalance we need a more 
objective understanding of each other 
kaifu also will reassure bush and other us officials of japans 
political and diplomatic stability ministry officials said 
some japanese foreign policy initiatives have been stalled in 
recent months as the liberal democrats grappled with a series of 
money and sex scandals and an election setback that led to the 
resignation of kaifus two predecessors

by ms feliciano police said

east german leader erich honecker 
underwent gall bladder surgery but doctors had to halt the operation 
because of the condition of the organ had deteriorated west german 
security sources said wednesday 
east germany denied the reports about honecker 77 a foreign 
ministry spokesman in east berlin speaking on condition of 
anonymity said he was progressing toward recovery 
honecker was reported to have undergone a gall bladder operation 
two weeks ago the east german government said on aug 24 he was 
continuing on the road to recovery 
but the hessicher rundfunk radio on wednesday said the west 
german government has received intelligence information indicating 
honeckers condition is more serious than official east german 
reports suggest 
government security sources confirmed the radio report but would 
provide few details 
according to the sources honeckers surgeons were forced to 
abandon the gall bladder operation because of the condition of the 
tissue 
the information was relayed to the west german government by the 
countrys intelligence service the sources said there were no 
further details 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity also speculated 
whether honeckers illness may be one reason the east german 
government has not yet taken decisive steps to deal with an exodus 
of refugees out of the communist country 
at least 6000 east germans have fled to west germany through 
hungary since hungary began dismantling its border barriers in may 
scores more are holed up in west german missions and embassies in 
east berlin and prague demanding they be allowed to emigrate 
the situation has created tensions between the two germanies as 
well as between hungary and east germany 
hungary is among east bloc nations experimenting with liberal 
reforms while east germany remains a hardline communist state 
hans klein spokesman for west german chancellor helmut kohl 
said there has been zero movement by the east german government 
on the refugee problem 
but i do not know if this has any connection with mr 
honeckers condition klein said 
klein also said kohls offer still stands to talk with honecker 
about the refugee problem 
but there is a question about whether mr honecker would be 
able to do that klein said 
other highranking east german officials also are ailing say 
sources in east berlin 
premier willi stoph has a stomach ailment and has not appeared in 
public for some time and guenter mittag who is responsible for 
economic affairs has been suffering from acute leg pains said the 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
stoph is 75 and mittag is 62 
honecker has not been seen in public since his operation 
werner kohlhoff spokesman for the west berlin government said 
mayor walter momper had hoped to meet with honecker at the leipzig 
trade fair on sunday but that city officials have learned the east 
german leader will not be there 
sources in east berlin said mittag also would not be at the fair 
east germanys leadership attaches enormous prestige to the 
leipzig trade fair and honecker traditionally opens the biannual 
international event 
honecker has been hospitalized twice this summer 
illness forced him to leave a warsaw pact summit in bucharest on 
july 8 before its conclusion and the official east german media 
later announced he was in a hospital for problems related to 
gallstones 
he has ruled the country of 166 million people since 1971 he 
supervised the building of the berlin wall 10 years earlier 
honecker has strongly shunned the adoption of kremlinstyle 
political reforms a factor in the recent surge of refugees from 
east germany to the west

reports of ties between 
israelis and colombian drug lords are overblown and only one or two 
companies may have violated the law defense minister yitzhak rabin 
said wednesday 
rabin on a visit to the west bank also said there were few if 
any israeli mercenaries 
he and other officials sought to stem the scandal about 
allegations that former army officers gave paramilitary training to 
assassination squads for the medellin drug cartel in colombia 
israeli media said the issue also had divided government 
officials and could affect lucrative arms exports to colombia 
police questioned two more employee of hod hahanit or spearhead 
a security and arms trading company said to have provided training 
for the cartel 
yair klein a reserve lieutenant colonel who heads the company 
confirmed wednesday an israeli official told him to leave colombia 
because he might be arrested raising the possibility the 
government knew more of his dealings than it has acknowledged 
parliaments law committee rejected a proposal that laws 
controlling the export of arms and military expertise be 
strengthened to allow prosecution of israelis for offenses committed 
abroad 
some lawmakers said even discussing the matter could influence 
the current police investigation legislator amnon rubinstein of the 
leftleaning shinui party said the government was moving too slowly 
what bothers me is that for a very long time these things 
have been known he said in my opinion there is no room for 
israelis to be military advisers to unsavory types 
rabin told journalists i believe the media especially in 
israel are making unjustified statements based on rumors rather 
than on solid information 
he said the government was investigating and would punish any 
former officers who broke israeli law we are not trying to hide 
to conceal the defense minister said 
israels controls on exports of military equipment and knowledge 
are the most stringent in the world and companies must have defense 
ministry permits for overseas deals rabin said 
i believe basically the number of people who have not obeyed 
the law is very very limited he said one or two israeli 
companies either worked without permission or went beyond the 
permission allow me also to stress the point that israeli 
mercenaries are basically nonexistent 
news reports from colombia said five israelis were among 
foreigners involved in training killers for the drug cartels 
a report in haaretz an israeli papter said defense officials 
ignored advice by the foreign ministry two years ago not to issue 
permits for deals with private groups in colombia because the 
country was unstable 
al hamishmar another daily said rabin was angered by prime 
minister yitzhak shamirs expression of doubt after rabin ordered 
an investigation that any israeli officers had behaved improperly 
israel radio said the allegations were raising questions in 
colombia about whether to order more kfir jet fighters from israel 
arms exports usually are secret in israel but the daily yediot 
ahronot said tuesday that colombia had bought more than 350 million 
worth of aircraft guns and other military hardware from this 
country in the past several years

the revolutions spirituality and its islamic goals

an infectious swine disease previously found 
only in europe has been confirmed in stillborn and weak baby pigs in 
the united states the agriculture department said wednesday 
the disease is a type of leptospirosis which is caused by 
corkscrewshaped bacteria called leptospires about 180 types of 
leptospires cause disease in livestock said carole a bolin 
veterinary medical officer with usdas agricultural research service 
in ames iowa 
bolin said in a report released in washington that the disease 
caused by an organism called bratislava was found in an iowa herd 
the name resulted after the bacterium was first isolated in 1953 
from a hedgehog in bratislava czechoslovakia 
leptospirosis is transmitted primarily by infected urine but the 
leptospires also can pass through the pregnant females placenta to 
the fetus another probable cause of infection is thought to be 
venereal transmission from infected boars 
humans in contact with infected animals or urine can develop 
leptospirosis the report said 
bratislava is being studied as a possible contributor to a 
mystery syndrome that began causing stillbirths abortions and 
deaths of nursing baby pigs about a year ago in the midwest 
the study was undertaken five months ago at the agencys animal 
disease center in ames under a technology transfer agreement 
with norden laboratories of lincoln neb 
bolin said the next step is to inoculate pregnant sows with 
bratislava to establish absolute proof that the us version 
causes reproductive disease also laboratory tests need to be 
conducted to determine the effectiveness of vaccines in pregnant 
sows 
norden is marketing two vaccines under conditional usda licenses 
and is applying for permanent licencing she said 
a company scientist joseph c frantz said vaccination with the 
conditionally licensed vaccine protects the animal against 
clinical signs caused by bratislava through one pregnancy he 
recommended vaccination prior to each breeding 
leptospirosis in both animals and humans can be mild or severe 
and is often misdiagnosed the agency said the disease in humans 
has been confused with influenza hepatitis yellow fever 
pneumonia polio meningitis and encephalitis

there he said 
he said there was insufficent water for washing and the 
vietnamese had to bathe in the sea garbage collection is poor and 
there are no indoor bathrooms he said 
lo said at least one of the victims had eaten improperly cooked 
seafood and may have caught the disease as a result 
he said it was unlikely the disease was transmitted through 
government dry rations 
un refugee officials have said vietnamese refugees in hong 
kongs screening centers were in danger of dying because of 
malnutrition and disease 
lo said there was no such danger on tai a chau but he 
acknowledged that common disease on the island include pinkeye 
skin illness and enterogastritis 
a medical team went to the island wednesday and distributed drugs 
to the vietnamese as a preventive measure and the government has 
imposed a quarantine on the camp he said 
lo said the restriction could be lifted in 10 days if no new 
cases were reported 
sundays rioting broke out during rice distribution when about 
1000 vietnamese started throwing stones at police 
authorities fired tear gas to disperse the stonethrowers but 
withdrew that night for fear of further violence 
police reoccupied tai a chau on monday with helicopters and 
landing vessels they found the police station health center and 
public facilities destroyed and received several rape and robbery 
reports 
by then about 1000 boat people had swum to a barge off the 
island to escape further attack they were later moved to shek kwu 
chau another nearby island 
the government has also placed a quarantine on that island 
because of the cholera outbreak on tai a chau 
on tuesday 13 vietnamese were arrested on charges of rape 
robbery and assault during the sunday rioting 
about 55000 vietnamese are staying in hong kong waiting for 
repatriation or resettlement 
the government began to put newly arriving boat people on tai a 
chau in june in an emergency measure to cope with their increasing 
numbers refugees usually stay there for about two weeks before they 
are inoculated and moved to other detention centers 
the three cholera victims had been on the island for a month

the bells of the st catherines church 
carillon in this port city pealed wednesday for the first time since 
the end of world war ii a symbol of peace and reconciliation 50 
years after the conflict began 
the bells a gift from the west german people to the residents of 
gdansk were dedicated at a mass celebrated by bishop tadeusz 
goclowski joining in readings during the service for the intention 
of the wars victims was a german evangelical minister 
afterward goclowski consecrated the bells with holy water and 
the 1000member crowd of poles and germans listened to a 
computerdirected carillon concert of works of beethoven and mozart 
the first melody played by the rededicated carillon was part of 
beethovens ninth symphony 
friday is the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of world war ii 
the first shots were fired in gdansk on the morning of sept 1 1939 
thirtyseven bells weighing more than 16 tons make up the 
carillon which replaces a set of bells that was lost during the 
war when the former free city of danzig was incorporated into the 
third reich 
at the end of the war the city was largely destroyed subjected 
to allied bombing raids soviet artillery and housetohouse 
fighting during the red armys advance on the city in march 1945 
the german population fled or was expelled after the war and 
danzig became the polish city of gdansk causing anger among some 
germans toward poles 
but the theme of the rededication ceremony stressed 
reconciliation between the nations 
a former gdansk resident hans eggegrecht headed the drive to 
replace the bells after noticing the destroyed bell tower during a 
trip to his native city five years ago

a us congressman said wednesday that 
objections of filipino senators to us bases here could prompt 
washington to reduce its military commitment to the philippines 
he spoke the same day that activists mounted two small protests 
at the us embassy about the bases 
rep john murtha dpa was referring to a resolution signed 
thursday by 12 of 23 filipino senators who called for closing the 
bases when their lease expires in 1991 
us and philippine officials are expected to begin talks this 
year on extending the lease 
but any agreement must be approved by twothirds of the 
philippine senate the senate resolution suggests president corazon 
aquino would lack votes for ratification 
obviously it cant be ratified if they stick to what they 
say said murtha i have no idea whether they mean what they 
say but i know it doesnt help the political situation and climate 
in the united states when we see distinguished members of their 
congress making statements about the treaty 
about 40000 us troops civilian employees and military 
dependents are stationed at six us installations which include 
clark air base and the subic bay naval base they are among the 
largest outside the united states 
earlier wednesday murtha who serves as chairman of the house 
defense appropriations subcommittee told an american business group 
that maintaining current force levels in the philippines is not a 
top priority of the american congress 
he said statements against the bases could inflame members of 
congress eager to find ways of reducing american troop strength 
overseas 
however at a later news conference murtha said he believes the 
bases are vital to the defense of the far east and contribute 
economically to the philippines about 70000 filipinos work at the 
installations collecting more than 96 million in annual salaries 
filipino critics claim the bases infringe on national sovereignty 
during the protests wednesday about 100 leftist students 
unfurled antibases banners at the department of foreign affairs 
a group of militant feminists mounted a separate protest against 
the bases in front of the us embassy 
no violence was reported in either protest 
in october the united states agreed to provide 481 million a 
year to keep the bases until 1991 but many filipino politicians 
believe washington should pay more 
no date has been set for talks on a new agreement us officials 
say vice president dan quayle is expected to discuss the timetable 
when he visits the philippines next month 
murtha was part of a congressional delegation that included reps 
robert livingston rla and barbara kennelly dconn

sir peter scott a conservationist who pioneered 
the effort to save the worlds rain forests and helped launch the 
world wildlife fund is dead at age 79 
scott a world war ii naval hero and an olympic yachtsman died 
tuesday in bristols southmead hospital following a heart attack 
earlier in the day while visiting the western england city he would 
have been 80 on sept 14 
he was known internationally for his campaigns to save birds 
bears tigers and whales 
in his last years he was forced to defend his father capt 
robert falcon scott against revisionist historians who claimed the 
great polar explorer bungled the 191112 expedition in which he and 
four companions perished of cold and hunger 
scotts death was announced wednesday by the wildlife and 
wetlands trust which he began in 1946 at slimbridge on the severn 
river estuary where he lived he founded it as a haven for water 
birds after shooting a goose and seeing it die slowly 
i thought i wouldnt do that to my worst enemy so why should i 
do it to a goose he recalled 
scott was a cofounder in 1961 of the swissbased world wildlife 
fund now the world wide fund for nature he designed its panda logo 
and helped raise more than 60 million for 6000 conservation 
projects in 135 countries 
the fund is largely credited with saving the indian tiger and the 
polar bear and with pioneering efforts to save rain forests 
buckingham palace said queen elizabeth ii her husband prince 
philip and their son prince charles sent condolences to scotts 
widow philippa 
sir david attenborough the tv naturalist described scott as the 
patron saint of conservation one of the great figures who warned 
the world of what was happening and not only warned but did 
something about it 
scott was 2 when his father died in march 1912 in the antarctic 
snows after being beaten to the south pole by the norwegian roald 
amundsen the explorer left a note to his wife saying make the 
boy interested in natural history it is better than games 
his son said he felt having a hero for a father meant he had to 
do well in different fields 
scott became a celebrated bird artist won an olympic yachting 
bronze medal in 1936 was a thricedecorated naval commander in 
world war ii a champion glider pilot americas cup helmsman in 
1964 and the first briton to be knighted for services to 
conservation in 1973 
he wrote or illustrated nearly 40 books and an autobiography 
the eye of the wind in 1961 
scott was prominent in whalesaving efforts and said in 1987 
if the pressure is kept up all commercial whaling should cease 
and the only whales killed would be for subsistence by people like 
the eskimos who take small numbers and i think they should be 
allowed to go on doing so 
he led expeditions of explorers and naturalists to many parts of 
the world including three in his fathers footsteps to the 
antarctic which he called the last environmental frontier 
scott believed in the loch ness monster saying it was a family 
of prehistoric creatures living in the scottish lake he gave the 
animal a scientific name nessiteras rhombopteryx meaning ness 
monster with diamond fin 
scott and his family expressed anger in 1985 over a tv serial 
the last place on earth based on a debunking book by roland 
huntford called scott and amundsen it depicted his father as an 
incompetent loser and alleged that capt scotts wife kathleen had 
an affair with another norwegian explorer fridtjof nansen while 
her husband was battling in the antarctic 
they were very friendly but i dont believe for an instant that 
she had an affair with him sir peter said 
scott is survived by his two wives and three children in 1942 
he married the novelist elizabeth jane howard by whom he had a 
daughter the marriage was dissolved in 1951 and the same year he 
married his secretary philippa talbotponsonby who bore him a son

the bush administration blamed vietnam and 
cambodia on wednesday for the collapse of a 19nation peace 
conference on cambodia and reiterated its reluctant support for a 
khmer rouge role in a transitional government 
the conference launched in late july in paris by secretary of 
state james a baker iii and other foreign ministers is dissolving 
in disagreement over how to end the conflict between rival warring 
actions 
the collapse could result in steppedup fighting between 
government forces and an anticommunist resistance that includes 
exiled cambodian leader prince sihanouk and khmer rouge elements 
when baker flew to paris to kick off the conference there 
already was recognition that a difficult compromise had to be struck 
to end the civil war and that the deliberations could take months 
but there was guarded optimism the bloodletting might be ended with 
diplomacy 
cambodian prime minister hun sen who hopes to retain power after 
the scheduled withdrawal of 26000 vietnamese troops from cambodia a 
month from now strenuously objected to any role for the khmer 
rouge who were ousted in an invasion by vietnam in 1978 and still 
have chinas support 
the khmer rouge under thenleader pol pot is believed 
responsible for the massacre of at least 1 million cambodians from 
1975 to 1978 
speaking in washington for the bush administration margaret 
tutwiler the state department spokeswoman registered unalterable 
us opposition to the khmer rouge returning to power she called it 
a murderous group 
however she said the united states would continue to support 
sihanouk if he believed that khmer rouge elements along with 
members of the phnom penh government should have an interim 
role 
asked why the conference had collapsed she said it was not 
possible to achieve a lasting settlement due to the failure of the 
vietnamese and hun sen regime to negotiate constructively on key 
issues 
at the same time the spokeswoman said progress was made toward 
the important goal of a free and independent cambodia 
any progress is welcome and we should build upon it

the israeli army is creating a special unit to 
help put down the 20monthold palestinian uprising in the occupied 
territories after experimenting with soldiers specially trained in 
riot control an army spokesman said wednesday 
the move marks a break with israeli military tradition in which 
troops are trained mainly as combat soldiers for conventional 
warfare 
the new special force is intended to get regular combat troops 
out of the occupied west bank and gaza strip and back to standard 
training programs said col renaan gissin the armys deputy chief 
spokesman 
gissin said two experimental special companies have been 
operating in the occupied territories for several months their 
formation followed complaints by some officers that duty in the 
territories was cutting into regular training 
the decision to form a permanent new unit was made after the 
experimental companies proved effective in dealing with palestinians 
who have been waging an uprising against israeli rule in lands 
occupied in the 1967 middle east war gissin said 
at least 19 palestinians and two israeli soldiers were injured 
wednesday in new clashes in the occupied territories 
in the gaza strip town of khan yunis two soldiers were injured 
by stones and 11 palestinians were shot and wounded when troops 
opened fire during a stonethrowing melee the army and arab reports 
said 
six palestinians were shot and wounded in three other clashes in 
the seaside strip 
an army spokesman confirmed two arabs wounded in the west bank 
and said the military was investigating other reports 
at least 554 palestinians have been killed in clashes with 
soldiers or israeli civilians during the uprising thirtyeight 
israeli also have been slain 
these units will spend most of their service in one place 
gissin said adding they will know the area and the population 
better than troops that rotate in and out every three or four 
months 
the special unit dubbed the territories companies will 
receive specialized training on how to deal with stone and 
firebombthrowing youths attacking troops in cities and villages 
gissin said 
he said they would operate better in such situations than elite 
infantry units trained to fight regular forces on a battlefield or 
guerrillas attempting to infiltrate into the country 
the daily alhamishmar reported that new recruits are reluctant 
to be sent to the experimental forces which did more police duties 
than the more glamorous combat units but gissin denied the report 
we have had no problem in recruiting men and do not expect any 
when we enlarge the unit he said 
all israeli men do three years of compulsory military duty and 
serve in the reserves for up to 60 days a year until the age of 54 
often in the occupied territories most women serve for two years in 
noncombat units and later in the reserves until the age of 24 
gissin said the possibility of hurting soldiers morale by having 
them spend the majority of their threeyear military service among 
hostile civilians had been thoroughly examined by military 
psychologists 
of course we examined the issue and we are confident the 
soldiers will be ok he said

i want to emphasize that what is at stake in the battles being 
fought in communities across the nation is more than just the fate 
of a few novels or a textbook or two said john buchanan chairman 
of the group founded by television producer norman lear 
we are witnessing in these skirmishes the clash of two 
competing views of public education in america the censors see 
efforts to teach our children about the world around them as a 
threat the rest of us see it as a way to broaden our childrens 
vistas and opportunities 
sex education remains a major target by what the group described 
as the far right which already scored some damaging victories 
during the last school year the report said 
in south carolina for example the report cited statewide 
restrictions that forced school textbook publishers to delete 
information on the use of condoms to prevent the spread of aids 
there is a growing ultraconservative movement to restrict the 
availability of information in the school about such topics as 
contraception abortion and aids said president arthur kropp who 
predicted that attacks on sex education are likely to increase 
with recent supreme court rulings on reproductive rights 
the report said school libraries were the target of significantly 
more censorship attempts during the 198889 school year accounting 
for nearly half the challenges nationwide it said that most of the 
attacks it had investigated resulted in either removal of the 
material or in restrictions on its use such as requiring parental 
consent 
we are finding more and more instances in which selfappointed 
censors focus not just on material in the curriculum but on 
materials available in school libraries said kropp not content 
with sanitizing classroom teaching they want to scour the library 
shelvs of any materials of which they disapprove 
the main targets of such challenges were literary classics such 
as john steinbecks of mice and men and jd salingers the 
catcher in the rye as well as plays by arthur miller and 
aristophanes the report said 
the most frequent objections the report said were to materials 
seen as containing offensive language and those perceived as 
touching on satanism witchcraft and the occult challenges to 
satanism has grown over the last two years said donna hulsizer 
author of the report 
no challenges were reported in alaska delaware hawaii idaho 
minnesota new mexico north dakato utah or the district of 
columbia the report said it said california led the nation with 
what it called 23 censorship attempts

premier li peng said chinas economic reforms 
wont be abandoned but official media wednesday attacked a former 
leader who helped foster those reforms 
li in a speech seen wednesday said reforms adopted before june 
will remain in effect and local governments can continue 
experimenting with other reforms li said 
our policies cant be changed at will this helps stabilize 
peoples hearts stabilize stabilize the economy 
li said in a speech to the state council chinas cabinet 
protests by students demanding more social reforms to the ranks and 
match 
chinas freer economy broke out april 15 chinas leaders crushed 
the prodemocracy movement with a military raid on demonstrators in 
beijing on june 34 
li gave the speech aug 15 but it was not published until 
tuesday in shanghais liberation daily the paper was seen in 
beijing on wednesday the release of speeches in china is often 
delayed 
zhao ziyang the former communist party chief who helped carry 
out chinas liberalized economic reforms wasn increase the partys leadership 
of enterprises in 
ideological education and develop the partys supervisory role 
the beijing daily commentary accused zhao and his economic 
adviser bao tong of violating the party constitution by advocating 
policies that sought to reduce party interference in the economy and 
to let some market forces rule 
bao tong and others did their utmost to distort the supervisory 
function of party organizations in enterprises and did everything 
possible to limit and fetter them the paper said 
the reforms were beginning to see some success with lively small 
and mediumsized business and rural and township enterprises 
invigorating the economy and making profits unlike the ponderous 
stateowned enterprises however their rapid growth also caused 
economic problems such as shortages of raw materials and energy 
the commentary quoted zhao as saying in a 1986 meeting with 
provincial governors the big problems and issues in an enterprise 
need not be discussed by the party committee otherwise it would be 
hard to put the reforms into effect it is necessary to make some 
some rather large changes to the original regulations 
bao has been arrested and some reports say zhao is under house 
arrest

dorothy schiff the rich girl who for 37 
years ran the new york post with a liberal editorial stance and a 
tight rein on finances died wednesday of cancer she was 86 
schiff who had been ill since may died at her home said peter 
faris a vice president at the post 
schiff bought the post in 1939 at the behest of her husband she 
sold it to media magnate rupert murdoch in 1976 for a reported 31 
million 
in between she commanded the fortunes of a newspaper which in 
her words advocated honest unionism social reform and humane 
government programs 
under schiff the post was a middleclass tabloid known for its 
features columns and liberal views 
while other new york newspapers withered and died the 
journalamerican the world telegram and sun the herald tribune 
the mirror the post survived and eventually became the only 
afternoon paper in the city 
often voted least likely to succeed in new yorks competitive 
journalistic climate she outmaneuvered and outlasted rivals 
newsweek once wrote 
dorothy schiff known to many as dolly was born in new york city 
in 1903 her grandfather was financier jacob schiff a founder of 
the kuhn loeb banking house and a prominent philanthropist 
the young heiress studied at new yorks exclusive brearly school 
and attended bryn mawr college in pennsylvania 
i was a rich kid of the right kind not the robber baron type 
and had been to the right schools she once observed 
as an adult she was thrifty i dont know if its fear of 
being selfindulgent or a puritanical guilt but spending just isnt 
easy for me 
in later years schiffs tight fist was legendary the post 
always seemed to do more with less the smallest staff the most 
decrepit equipment 
in the early 1930s schiff got involved in a number of social 
welfare efforts a settlement house for immigrants several 
hospitals a club that provided lunches to women looking for jobs in 
new york 
by birth schiff was a republican but the depression and the 
response of the administration of franklin d roosevelt led her to 
change her affiliation she became a confidante of both the 
president and eleanor roosevelt and at one point declined 
roosevelts invitation to run a program for farm women 
in 1939 schiff bought the post at the request of her husband 
george backer an appointee to city council who ran unsuccessfully 
for congress at first backer served as editor and president she 
served as director and vice president and her ownership was not 
public knowledge 
financial losses led schiff to conclude that the paper needed 
comic strips columns features and a tabloid format when backer 
disagreed schiff promoted theodore olin thackrey from feature 
editor to executive editor 
in 1942 schiff became president and publisher she divorced 
backer in 1943 and married thackrey 
when i took on the post i didnt have much faith in myself or 
the paper and i didnt really think i could pull it out now its 
part of me we are part of each other schiff said in a 1976 
biography men money and magic by jeffrey potter 
her notion that features would build readership paid off the 
posts magazinestyle stories and pages of columns at one point in 
the 1940s the post had nearly 50 columnists including schiff 
herself had faithful followers 
the post also became known for its sports coverage although 
schiff confided later i never read a sports page in my life 
she and thackrey differed in print in 1948 both opposed harry 
truman but thackrey supported progressive candidate henry wallace 
and schiff backed republican thomas e dewey by 1950 thackrey was 
out both as editor and as schiffs husband 
in the 1950s under james wechsler the post became known for 
investigative reporting wechsler eventually relinquished control of 
the news department and took over the editorial page and in the 
1960s the newspapers features became softer 
after years of profits the papers fortunes dimmed in the 1970s 
as much of its audience moved to the suburbs ultimately schiff 
sold it to murdoch it was a terrible headache she said 
murdoch transformed the post into a racier more conservative 
tabloid before selling it to real estate developer peter s kalikow 
in 1988 
schiffs four marriages ended in divorce her first husband was 
richard bw hall followed by backer thackrey and rudolf sonneborn 
she is survived by her two daughters adele hall sweet and 
sarahann kramarsky her son mortimer h hall 15 grandchildren and 
nine greatgrandchildren 
a private burial was planned

some changes in federal regulations affecting 
the care and handling of laboratory animals will go into effect oct 
30 the agriculture department said wednesday 
among the changes will be a requirement that research facilities 
create special committees to assure humane care and treatment of 
animals 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service said the revisions will partially 
implement amendments to the federal animal welfare act passed by 
congress almost four years ago 
the amendments provide new and stricter requirements to protect 
laboratory animals from undue pain and stress tighten enforcement 
of rules already on the books and revise the list of definitions 
needed to carry out the law 
current regulations define standards for animal use including 
minimum requirements for handling housing feeding watering 
sanitation ventilation shelter and veterinary care 
glosser said the revisions will make the rules for dogs cats and 
nonhuman primates including monkeys more complete and easier to 
understand 
besides requiring research facilities to create special animal 
care committees the new regulations include provisions for 
veterinary care and holding facilities and handling 
the animal welfare act covers most businesses that buy or sell 
warmblooded animals exhibit them and transport them commercially 
rats mice birds horses and farm animals are not covered by the 
regulations 
an agency spokeswoman pat elhinnawy said there are three parts 
to the package of regulatory changes the final decisions announced 
wednesday affect only the first and second parts 
part one includes a definition of terms used in carrying out the 
1985 amendments she said part two relates to the identification 
methods records licensing requirements and other details 
part three which is still under study by the agency will 
include details of the actual standards for federal regulation of 
animal care the space each must have access to food and water 
and other details that affect their routines 
elhinnawy said she didnt know when usda might decide on final 
rules for part three

a tv camera lowered into the damaged three 
mile island reactor confirmed small cracks in a steel liner 
officials said wednesday 
the cracks in the unit 2 reactor appear to be tears in the thin 
stainless steel lining inside the 5inchthick carbon steel reactor 
vessel which contains the radioactive fuel and hot water 
surrounding it the plant operator said 
still unanswered is whether the cracks extend from the liner into 
the reactor vessel 
there isnt any way to tell definitely but its not considered 
likely said doug bedell spokesman for the plant operator gpu 
nuclear corp 
the reactor was damaged in 1979 in the us nuclear power 
industrys worst accident 
the investigation of the cracks required a newly developed 
radiationresistant highresolution camera and special tools to 
brush debris from the area probe the cracks and take measurements 
through 40 feet of water 
the liner threesixteenths of an inch thick prevents corrosion 
of the steel below it high fuel temperatures and the difference in 
the contraction rates between the two types of steel caused the 
cracks or tears gpu nuclear said 
one crack was 6 inches long about threethirtyseconds of an 
inch wide and about onesixteenth of an inch deep gpu nuclear said 
three other cracks were from 3 to 5 inches long the plant operator 
said 
the color pictures taken saturday revealed a few additional 
cracks in an area where two lines thought to be cracks were spotted 
in july gpu nuclear said 
molten uranium fuel as hot as 5000 degrees flowed to the 
reactors bottom during the march 1979 accident that damaged the 
reactor a series of operator and mechanical errors cut off cooling 
water to the radioactive core and about half the fuel rods melted 
radioactive gas was released to the atmosphere 
since the accident there has been no evidence that the vessel 
was breached bedell said 
tmis unit 1 reactor was undamaged and remains in service 
under a program sponsored in part by the nuclear regulatory 
commission samples of the steel will be removed for study by 
researchers from europe and japan the work is expected to take up 
to 2 years

portauprince haiti ap political leaders said wednesday 
that two coalitions have been formed to field candidates in general 
elections that may be held next year 
marc bazin said he has forged an alliance with two other 
prominent leaders centerleftist serge gilles and dejean belizaire 
a supporter of haitian ruler lt gen prosper avril 
we hope to offer the people a credible coalition an 
opportunity to have a government of the people by the people and 
for the people said bazin a frontrunner in the nov 29 1987 
elections that were aborted by violence 
bazin now heads the centerright movement for the installation of 
democracy party 
his coalition the national alliance for democracy and progress 
will present a joint platform and common candidates for general 
elections which the independent electoral council said would not be 
held before next year 
the council is expected to announce next month a calendar for 
local legislative and presidential elections 
bazin said most of the platform has been written but refused to 
disclose its content he said the coalition is negotiating including 
other moderate leaders in its ranks 
three other prominent moderate politicians louis dejoie gerard 
philippeauguste and hubert de ronceray all leading candidates in 
the 1987 canceled elections met wednesday to negotiate a coalition 
of their own 
de ronceray head of the rightist mobilization for national 
development party said they intended to find a common program to 
run the country they have no formal name for the coalition so far 
nor have they announced a platform 
dejoie said he invited sylvio claude also a major candidate in 
1987 to join the coalition 
bazin claude dejoie and centerleftist gerard gourge were the 
four top contenders in 1987 when thugs protected by soldiers 
massacred at least 34 voters at polling stations and caused the 
elections to be canceled 
lt gen henri namphy who ruled haiti at that time dissolved 
the independent electoral council and said he would hold new 
elections 
the four leading presidential candidates boycotted namphys 
elections in january 1988 which brought leslie manigat to power 
foes of the government said those armyrun elections were riddled 
with fraud 
de ronceray and philippeauguste both agreed to take part in that 
balloting despite a major boycott by voters 
namphy ousted manigat in june 1988 and was himself ousted the 
following september in a soldiers revolt which brought avril to 
power 
avril pledged a return to democratic rule and encouraged creation 
of the new electoral council which was appointed by institutions 
that included the roman catholic church trade unions and human 
rights groups

armed with evidence showing that 77 percent of 
the nations adolescent deaths each year are preventable doctors 
and educators joined wednesday to form a group to attack problems 
confronting youth 
a national commission on adolescent health was formed by the 
national association of state boards of education and the american 
medical association 
the commission was formed said roseann bentley president of the 
education association when we observed that we could not reduce 
our young peoples vulnerability to aids alcohol and drug 
addiction heart disease and other preventable illness without 
changing their behavior 
hungry sick violated abused doped up kids cannot learn 
said bentley research tells us that oneshot education programs 
do not work and that comprehensive multicomponent programs that 
change behavior are critical i cannot overemphasize the need for 
schools families and communities to work together 
ms bentley will serve as commission cochairman along with dr 
m roy schwarz of the american medical association others on the 
31member commission include former surgeon general c everett koop 
florida education commission betty castor illinois gov james 
thompson california school chief bill honig and pollster george 
gallup jr 
william hendee ama vice president for science and technology 
said an estimated 77 percent of the nations adolescent deaths each 
year are preventable in the 1950s 75 percent of deaths of youths 
aged 10 to 19 years were due to natural causes compared with only 
27 percent in the 1980s 
hendee added that more than 75 percent of seniors who tried 
cigarettes first and almost 53 percent of seniors who have gotten 
drunk first did so before starting high school rates for suicide 
and birth for teens 10 to 14yearsold have gone up dramatically in 
recent years 
both the ama and education association said national attention 
and community based efforts should focus on comprehensive school 
health programs for all grades kindergarten through 12th and 
particularly on programs for the disadvantaged and those involved in 
risky or lifethreatening behaviors

antiabortion activists wednesday claimed 
republican ileana roslehtinens election to succeed late florida 
rep claude pepper proves that their movement is alive and well 
in the wake of the supreme courts july 3 decision on abortion 
abortion rights supporters however said abortion was not a key 
issue in the race between ms roslehtinen and democrat gerald 
richman who had the support of abortion rights activists 
during the campaign ms roslehtinen 37 a state senator said 
she favored more restrictions on abortion and richman said he 
favored more choice however with polls indicating most voters 
supported abortion rights the gop candidate said abortion was more 
of a state legislative issue than a congressional issue 
sandra faucher director of the national right to life political 
action committee told reporters the organization made a 1000 
contribution to ms roslehtinen in the republican primary election 
and spent about 15000 for activities on her behalf in the general 
election campaign 
ileana roslehtinens win is a pivotal victory for the prolife 
movement ms faucher said at a news conference clearly the 
net prolife increment is alive and well after the webster 
decision 
the supreme courts 54 ruling giving states greater power to 
limit abortions appeared on the courts docket as webster vs 
reproductive health services 
ms faucher also said that abortion was a highly visible 
issue in the aug 12 special election in texas in which republican 
bob lanier an abortion opponent defeated democrat jim lane for the 
seat of former speaker of the house jim wright 
she said antiabortion candidates also have won six of eight 
state legislative races since the supreme court decision 
abortion rights leaders have contended that state legislative 
victories in two races in california and south carolina indicated 
movement in their direction in the wake of the court ruling 
ms faucher however said antiabortion candidates have won in 
races in missouri alabama mississippi georgia and two florida 
legislative districts 
kate michelman executive director of the national abortion 
rights action league denied that abortion was a major issue in the 
florida and texas congressional races or the legislative contests 
cited by ms faucher 
the antichoice movement is stretching a major point to claim 
victory on the issue of abortion in that florida race she said 
that was not the issue 
republicans hailed roslehtinens election as a major victory 
noting that pepper had held the seat for the democrats since 1962 
when the seat was created pepper died may 30 at age 88 
according to unofficial returns predominantly latin precincts 
had turnouts of more than 60 percent and gave ms roslehtinen the 
first cubanamerican elected to congress 80 percent to 90 percent 
of the vote she carried the entire district by a 53 percent to 47 
percent margin 
ms faucher however said ileana could not have won the vote 
with just the hispanic vote there is not a majority of hispanics in 
the district 
there had to be other issues involved and we feel that 
definitely the abortion issue played a major factor in the race 
she said 
ms michelman however said nothing was an issue there that 
could supersede the ethnicity issue the fact is that no issue even 
the issue of choice could overwhelm the ethnicity issue 
ms michelman said the abortion rights group contributed 5000 
to richmans campaign and spent about 2500 on getoutthevote 
efforts

the drug control strategy president bush will 
present next week will call for 250 million to 260 million in 
economic and military aid for the three main principal producing 
countries colombia peru and bolivia an administration source 
said wednesday 
earlier sources had said that aid figure could hit 300 million 
and national security adviser brent scowcroft indicated tuesday that 
the figure would be even higher than that 
when asked about the reported 300 million figure for the andean 
countries scowcroft said that figure i think you can assume 
has already been increased by the fact that we have given colombia 
65 million to help it fight the total war declared by the 
drug traffickers there 
however the 65 million is coming out of a discretionary fund 
available for fiscal 1989 which ends sept 30 the strategy covers 
fiscal 1990 
scowcroft had not intended to add the 65 million onto next 
years budget said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
president bush met with his top lieutenants in the drug war 
tuesday at his vacation home in kennebunkport to discuss the 
strategy but sources said wednesday that the focus of the meeting 
was colombia not the strategy and that no specific decisions were 
made on changing plans for future aid to that country 
the fundamental issues of the strategy kennebunkport did not 
change one of the sources said noting that the final strategy 
had gone to the printer before the meeting took place the source 
declined to be named publicly 
colombia has suffered numerous bombings by drug traffickers since 
colombian president virgilio barco imposed emergency regulations 1 
weeks ago that allow for the immediate resumption of extraditions of 
alleged drug traffickers to the united states for trial 
last friday bush announced the united states would give colombia 
65 million in military equipment such as helicopters in addition 
to some 25 million for protection for the colombian judiciary that 
had been promised previously congress last year set aside 5 
million for such protection colombian justice minister monica de 
reiff asked tuesday for 19 million in aid for judicial protection 
the drug strategy meanwhile will urge states to impose tough 
laws against drug users but wont threaten to withhold highway 
funds from those states that fail to do so as the draft strategy 
had proposed an administration source said wednesday 
in addition a proposed 25 million national drug intelligence 
center to be run jointly by the drug enforcement administration and 
the fbi was eliminated from the strategy due to a lastminute bid 
by the treasury department to develop a moneylaundering 
intelligence center and combine all the elements the source said 
the justice department objected to the sudden change of plans 
justice said wait a minute lets step back and do this 
right said the source 
however most of the elements included in the draft strategy 
the emphasis on targeting drug abusers who fuel the drug traffic 
the hiking of funds for drug treatment by 49 percent and the need 
for massively increased aid to the andean countries remain the 
same as proposed originally by william j bennett director of the 
office of national drug control policy the source said 
the final strategy is being kept under such close hold by the 
white house that many people who received copies of the draft must 
go to the old executive office building to read the final version 
aside from the copy in the oeob i think the only people who 
have it are those on the domestic policy council the national 
security council and a few of the presidents closest advisers 
the source said 
copies of the draft strategy were leaked to the press shortly 
after it was produced in late july 
in kennebunkport maine wednesday the vacation white house press 
office announced that a new program allowing judges to strip student 
loans and other federal benefits from drug offenders starts friday 
the vacationing president bush sent congress a report on 
wednesday spelling out how the penalties will work in both state and 
federal courts 
those convicted of drug trafficking or possession can be denied 
federal grants student loans contracts and professional and 
commercial licenses but not welfare disability or social security 
benefits 
the decision to deny any or all of an individuals benefits rests 
solely with the sentencing judge except for those convicted of a 
third drug trafficking offense for them permanent denial of the 
benefits is mandatory 
bushs letter to congress outlined plans to carry out the 
program required by the antidrug abuse act of 1988 
he said he is asking the us sentencing commission to inform 
federal courts of the program and the justice department will serve 
as a clearinghouse of information on those stripped of their benefit 
eligibility in the federal courts 
in addition bush said the justice department will coordinate 
the participation of the state courts in this program it will ask 
the chief judicial officer in each state to direct its courts to 
collect and forward the data on state court denials 
justice will then forward the information to the general services 
administration for inclusion on the federal procurement debarment 
list 
the penalties can be applied to convictions occurring after 
friday for offenses occuring on or after nov 18 1988 
next tuesday bush will go on radio and television to describe 
his new national drug strategy that is expected to stiffen penalties 
for individual users

massachusetts welfare workers assigned hundreds of 
dummy social security numbers to illegal immigrants to enable them 
to receive millions of dollars in state benefits 
federal officials said wednesday theres nothing illegal about 
it but gov michael dukakis says its got to stop because it goes 
against his new efforts to crack down on aid to illegal aliens 
which he says the state can no longer afford 
the practice started after dukakis issued a 1985 executive order 
barring state agencies from asking people applying for state 
services about their citizenship status 
but citizens or not the computerized welfare records required a 
case identification number for each person and that had to be a 
ninedigit number since for most people the id is the same as their 
social security number 
dukakis legal counsel don stern said the law setting up the 
general relief program a totally statefinanced welfare program for 
people who dont qualify for federal welfare left it up to the 
welfare department if applicants didnt have a social security 
number 
welfare spokeswoman michal regunberg said the department issued 
its own control numbers 
welfare department attorney thomas noonan said the dummy numbers 
started with a threedigit prefix not used by the social security 
administration 
regunberg said those control numbers would have been rejected by 
social security administration computers so they could not have 
been used to obtain federally subsidized welfare or by an illegal 
alien seeking a job 
john connolly a spokesman for the social security administration 
in boston said there is nothing illegal under federal law with 
using id numbers with the same number of digits as social security 
numbers 
as far as we are concerned there is nothing illegal 
connolly said 
welfare commissioner carmen caminosiegrist said illegal aliens 
made up 400 to 500 of the 28500 people in massachusetts getting 
general relief 
both she and human services secretary philip w johnston said 
some recipients without social security numbers were us citizens 
who were mentally ill or severely mentally retarded and had never 
obtained a social security card 
dukakis said wednesday he had not known dummy numbers were issued 
to illegals applying for general relief 
but i think in fairness to the people at the welfare 
department they were trying to help some folks who basically came 
in off the street were in dire need and had no other means of 
support dukakis said in an interview with radio station wtag in 
worcester where he was on an official trip 
dukakis said that in many cases the people were political 
refugees who faced death if they went back to their home countries 
however dukakis announced recently he was changing state policy 
to remove illegal aliens from relief rolls a move officials 
estimated would save about 1 million a year 
because of the fiscal situation we just cant continue to do 
this and we wont weve got to stop it dukakis said 
muriel heiberger director of the massachusetts immigrant and 
refugee coalition said she may challenge the change of policy in 
court 
this move on the part of the governor represents a tragic 
retreat from the commonwealths previous commitment to help people 
who fled their countries because of persecution violence or 
economic necessity she said

samuel pisar saw the 50th anniversary of 
world war ii as a time to celebrate the triumph over evil but the 
dispute over a convent near the auschwitz death camp he survived has 
cast a shadow on his efforts at reconciliation 
at the request of composer leonard bernstein pisar has written a 
personal reminiscence of the destruction in his native land that he 
will read at a concert friday to mark the anniversary of the 1939 
invasion of poland by germany that began the war 
i decided to tackle it out of solidarity and out of a need for 
reconciliation because i dont believe in hereditary enemies of 
history pisar said 
this 50th anniversary is a very good moment to celebrate our 
triumph over evil and move to a more hopeful future i am telling a 
polish story but also a jewish story he said 
pisar will narrate the concert which is to be broadcast live to 
more than 20 countries he plans to relate his experience which he 
says epitomizes that of many who endured world war ii 
he was 10 when the war struck his home city of bialystok in 
northeastern poland his mother wanted to flee but his father 
whose family had been in bialystok for several generations did not 
pisar was the only member of his family to survive the years that 
followed the gestapo killed his father and he lost his mother and 
sister to the concentration camps that claimed the lives of at least 
6 million other jews 
sent from auschwitz to camps in germany as a forced laborer 
pisar escaped from dachau and was liberated by the american army at 
the age of 16 
now a lawyer in paris pisar has made three previous trips to 
poland accompanying american senators international bankers and 
former french president valery giscard destaing 
this trip is more personal pisar brought his wife and three 
children with him to visit his native city of bialystok in 
northeastern poland and then to travel to auschwitz 
they have arrived to find that 50 years has not healed the 
spiritual wounds of war and that the historic tension between 
catholic and jews still impedes reconciliation 
the roman catholic hierarchys decision aug 10 to abrograte a 
1987 agreement to move a carmelite convent away from the auschwitz 
camp and remarks saturday by the leader of polands roman catholic 
church has left many jews including pisar troubled 
i am happy to be here and i feel that peace is fragile and the 
spark of freedom that we witness here today and that is so 
encouraging is fragile and yet i feel a discomfort i feel a pain 
deep physical pain pisar said 
for some strange reason at this precise moment of history to 
focus on tensions between jews and poles the two people that 
suffered more than any others from the second world war seems not 
only unnecessary but why give hitler posthumously such a 
satisfaction he said 
as one of the youngest camps survivors pisar says he feels 
compelled to speak out 
i dont want any polemics with the cardinal but with due 
respect his words even if wellintended were illchosen i am 
disappointed and surprised pisar said 
he was referring to an address by cardinal jozef glemp at the 
jasna gora monastery in czestochowa polands most revered shrine 
in which glemp said there would be no antisemitism in poland if 
jews abandon antipolish sentiments 
speaking about the convent glemp said the nuns wanted to be a 
symbol of human solidarity with the living and the dead and that 
asking them to leave would offend the feelings of poles 
pisar acknowledged that not only jews were killed in auschwitz 
but he said the site belongs to no one and that he could not 
tolerate the appropriation of the holocaust by christian symbols 
auschwitz is a place that belongs to everybody and no one he 
said it is the greatest wound ever inflicted on our civilization 
and its deserves respect silence 
i feel no anger to the carmelite nuns i think they are sincere 
in their desire to pray i respect that but i think it would be 
better if they prayed outside the perimeter of the death camp and i 
think god would be able to hear them better if they did he said 
pisar said he hoped that pope john paul ii would use his moral 
authority to stop the dispute before it festers 
he can bring it to a stop and i wish he would and that the 
dead would be left alone because it is really needed out of respect 
for the dead and compassion for the living he said

school lunchroom cooks are hampered in efforts 
to provide nutritious meals because the government donates mainly 
fatladen foods such as ground beef pork and luncheon meats a 
consumer health group said wednesday 
ellen haas director of the public voice for food and health 
policy criticized the agriculture department the agency 
responsible for administering the national school lunch program for 
not providing the critical leadership necessary to speed progress 
in reducing fat in school lunches 
scott dunn acting administator of usdas food and nutrition 
service countered by saying the department is committed to dietary 
guidelines developed jointly with the department of health and human 
services he said the guidelines dont set quantitative standards 
for fat 
there is no scientific consensus on appropriate levels of fat 
in childrens diets dunn said 
and the american school food service association noted in a 
statement that childrens eating habits are influenced by multiple 
factors such as home school and restaurants it said parents and 
community groups must share responsibility for improving young 
peoples dietary preferences 
the consumer group said its survey of school food service 
directors shows nevertheless that the government school lunch 
program lends little encouragement to dieticians seeking to lower 
the fat content of lunches 
public voice said 67 percent of 177 school food service directors 
surveyed told it that the usdas commodity distribution program is 
one of the most significant barriers to their efforts to provide 
nutritious meals more than 24 million children participated in 
lunch programs at more than 91000 schools during the 198889 
academic year 
the school lunch programs depend to some extent on commodities 
provided free of charge by the federal government to help them stay 
afloat financially the group said yet it said the 
commodities offered include a high proportion of fatladen foods 
public voice said that agriculture departmentdisbursed commodity 
foods account for about 30 percent of foods used for school lunches 
of the total estimated dollar value of the commodities available 
8174 million ground beef and pork luncheon meat and ham 
butter cheese and eggs constituted well over 50 percent it said 
of the bonus commodities offered to schools or commodities 
furnished above the basic allotments butter cheese pork beef 
and eggs comprised more than 90 percent of the dollar value the 
group said 
it said that more than 80 percent of the directors surveyed said 
they have taken some steps to reduce fat in their school lunches 
contrary to dunns statement public voice said there is a 
consensus among health professionals that fat in childrens diets 
should be reduced to about 30 percent of calories 
among other findings were these 
only 6 percent of the directors surveyed had established target 
levels or ranges for fat in their programs central city school 
districts were eight times more likely to establish such limits than 
were rural districts 
seventyseven percent reported having limited access to written 
matrials or training programs on how to purchase foods or modify 
recipes to reduce fat content twentythree percent said they did 
not receive any guidance or guidelines 
when asked to identify the single most important thing that 
could be done to help reduce fat 50 percent of the respondents said 
the commodity program should be changed and 26 percent said more 
nutritional education should be provided the remaining 24 percent 
were uncertain 
public voice recommended that the agriculture department provide 
greater leadership in educating school food service directors and in 
offering assistance in planning monthly menus including suggesting 
how often specific foods should be served 
the usda also should significantly expand the availability of 
lowerfat commodities to the schools the group said 
said dunn it is important to remember that no matter what 
level is deemed appropriate that level must be applied to a 
persons entire diet not to a single food or a single meal usda 
cannot at this time support setting quantitative fat standards or 
recommended frequency of serving certain foods 
the variety of foods donated to schools is under constant review 
he said adding that over the years significant progress has been 
made in providing more and more healthy wholesome foods including 
additional lowand reducedfat foods 
dunn also said his agency promotes and coordinates nutrition 
education and technical assistance for all involved in the school 
lunch program although he said that states have great flexibility 
in how they spend the money they have available for training 
the american food service association said in its statement that 
young peoples dietary habits are largely affected by national 
advertising which it called a major influence on childrens food 
preferences 
if change is to become a reality dietary modifications in 
school menus must be supported by parents and the community it 
said

it was an invitation rep ted weiss was only 
too happy to refuse 
weiss received a form letter signed by president bush saying he 
had been nominated by sen alfonse damato rny to the 
republican senatorial inner circle a clique of party loyalists who 
give at least 1000 a year to the national republican senatorial 
committee 
problem is weiss is a democrat a very liberal democrat 
the inner circle has many outstanding members including joe 
coors estee lauder arnold schwarzenegger the bush letter said 
i know you will enjoy meeting your fellow members at inner circle 
gatherings both in washington dc and around the country 
weiss said wednesday he respectfully declines 
and all this time i thought i was a dyedinthewool liberal 
he said either my fellow congressmen from across the aisle have 
had a change of heart or ive been terribly misinformed about their 
political philosophy 
but why would damato nominate weiss in the first place 
according to damato spokeswoman zenia mucha he didnt 
the senator lends his name for fundraising for the party 
she said weisss name must have been on some mailing list that 
was not purged 
wendy democker spokeswoman for the republican senatorial 
committee said were not going to consider it a mistake were 
going to say well theres hope for everybody 
she ticked the names off several onetime democrats who switched 
to the gop ronald reagan elizabeth dole jeane kirkpatrick 
and so if congressman weiss received one of these well weve 
certainly had a lot of members of congress in the house of 
representatives recently convert to the republican party she said

percent for richman a 38yearold brooklynborn attorney making 
his first bid for elective office 
ms roslehtinen said richman who carried the black and 
nonlatin white vote by about 90 percent had spurred hispanics by 
making them feel as if we might be secondclass americans because 
were naturalized americans

according to candidates qualifications not birthplace he also 
said he was responding to gop national chairman lee atwaters

unfortunate that something said over three months ago was taken

sen joseph biden ddel unveiled on 
wednesday debtfordrugs legislation intended to offer 
debtrelief incentives to latin american nations that subsidize the 
withdrawal of farm land from coca production 
the legislation to be introduced when congress reconvenes next 
week is modeled on debtfornature exchanges already in place to 
help protect tropical rain forests 
biden asserted in a statement that a us investment of 400 
million in a debtfordrugs plan could free up enough funds to 
subsidize the withdrawal of every acre in bolivia columbia and peru 
now in coca production 
coca crops are refined to produce cocaine one of the principal 
illicit drugs on the us narcotics market 
biden who is to deliver the democratic response to president 
bushs nationally televised adddress on drug policy next tuesday 
evening said that for the immediate future the united states must 
continue to extradite foreign drug traffickers for trial in us 
courts 
but in the long run the best way to cut coca production is to 
provide economic incentives to grow other crops biden said 
sen richard lugar rind who returned this week from a 14day 
visit to nine latin american countries contends that substituting 
other crops for coca will simply spread production of the enormously 
profitable crop to other countries 
lugar said the best hope is an intensive campaign to reduce 
narcotic consumption in the united states by discouraging firsttime 
and casual users and by rehabilitating addicts 
biden however said his plan can work in the countries involved 
and has a realistic prospect of winning public support in this 
country 
it is not a giveaway with no strings attached he said 
americans love a good deal and the debtfordrugs plan is exactly 
that 
under the biden legislation the united states hopefully with the 
help of us allies would create an international fund to negotiate 
debtfordrugs exchanges 
the fund would purchase debt owed to foreign banks by the 
governments of cocaproducing nations 
once a sizeable amount of debt had been acquired the fund would 
offer to forgive a cocaproducing nations interest on it for a year 
in exchange for subsidies to shift farmers out of coca production 
once coca reduction targets were reached the fund would forgive 
the outstanding debt in full

the government kept secret the formula 
it will unveil this week for a new administration but it increased 
security throughout panama on wednesday in anticipation of violent 
demonstrations 
officials of the current administration have made clear that the 
new government will be announced and will take office on friday 
when the term of acting president manuel solis expires 
it will have the blessing of gen manuel antonio noriega who as 
commander of the panamanian defense forces is the power behind the 
civilian administration the defense forces include both soldiers 
and police 
paramilitary groups organized into national defense committees 
trained in different sites throughout the capital on wednesday and 
government agencies said they were placing themselves on a state of 
alert 
opposition leaders said they planned no street protests against 
the installation of a new government on friday 
if anything happens it will be spontaneous said former 
opposition presidential candidate guillermo endara in an interview 
wednesday nothing special is going to happen on friday the 
government will change some figures and will retain others 
endara claims he won the may 7 elections which were annulled by 
the government 
the opposition refused a government offer to form a national 
reconciliation government the government rejected opposition 
demands that its victory be recognized and that noriega step down 
government officials said all formulas were being considered in 
the formation of the new government however sources speaking on 
the condition of anonymity said it appeared the new government 
would consist of a junta with civilian and military representatives 
the governemnt scheduled a special cabinet session for thursday 
morning 
a special session of the organization of american states will be 
held in washington on thursday at the request of the us government 
after a panamanian oas delegate challenged the bush administration 
to present evidence of noriegas alleged involvement in drug 
trafficking 
noriega was indicted on federal drug trafficking charges in the 
united states in february 1988 
noriega has commanded the defense forces since 1983 and is 
considered the countrys most powerful figure he has become the 
target of a us campaign to remove him and internally he is 
accused by the political opposition of repression and violation of 
human rights 
foreign minister jorge ritter called the us request for a 
special oas meeting an attempt to divert the continents attention 
away from what should be the main issue 
the focus of attention should be us aggression not noriega he 
said 
noriega denies the drug trafficking charges and accuses the 
united states of trying to oust him because of his nationalistic 
policies 
opposition leaders said wednesday that arrests announced by the 
government were part of the propaganda and repression campaign of 
the military 
former vice presidential candidate ricardo arias calderon told 
the associated press that 11 persons had been arrested most of them 
members of this christian democrat party

deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger 
was preparing to present new drug charges against panama at a 
special meeting thursday of the organization of american states 
us officials said 
the 31nation session was set at us request after panama last 
week challenged the bush administration for evidence of its charges 
of drug involvement against gen manuel antonio noriega 
the 18month unsuccessful us campaign to oust noriega as the 
behindthescenes ruler in panama is getting only lukewarm support 
from the hemisphere group 
the oas foreign ministers last week adopted a bland statement 
expressing concern about the situation in panama but the bush 
administration is hoping eagleburgers response to the challenge 
will put more zip in the oas approach 
two florida grand juries have already indicted noriega on drug 
smuggling charges this week us officials have hinted to reporters 
there is more evidence against him 
it is not clear how far eagleburger will go in documenting us 
allegations since prosecutors would not want any court case 
jeopardized 
in requesting the meeting william price the acting permanent 
us representative said the united states wanted to present a 
summary of the evidence and elaboration of the united states 
position on the critical situation in panama 
noriega attorney raymond takiff of miami demanded in a letter to 
the oas the right to crossexamine witnesses who were to appear 
before the organization 
the letter also asked for the opportunity to prove that the 
indictments against general noriega are motivated politically 
representing nothing more than indictment dipolomacy 
margaret tutwiler the state department spokeswoman confirmed on 
wednesday that eagleburger would focus on narcotics but she 
declined to offer any details in order not to preempt what the 
deputy secretary will be saying tomorrow 
the term of panamas provisional president manuel solis palma 
who was handpicked by noriega expires on thursday the bush 
administration and panamanian opponents of the general are concerned 
noriega will name a puppet government and not hold free elections

a woman who contends she killed her 
lesbian lover because she was a victim of battered spouse 
syndrome had been abused for years and feared for her life her 
lawyer said at her trial wednesday 
annette green 30 was beaten and tormented for 11 years before 
she fired a 38caliber pistol into the head of ivonne julio 32 
after a halloween party last year said defense attorney william 
lasley 
lasley hopes to introduce expert testimony at the murder trial to 
prove she suffered from battered spouse syndrome and acted in 
selfdefense 
attorneys for both sides believe the trial is one of the first in 
which the syndrome defense usually employed in cases involving 
longterm abusive heterosexual relationships has been applied in 
one involving a homosexual union 
ms greens love for ms julios teenage twin daughters kept her 
from ending the stormy relationship lasley said during a break in 
the first day of testimony wednesday 
for 11 years she was the mother of ms julios twins and 
performed the domestic duties of the relationship lasley said 
she was frequently battered and abused physically and 
psychologically along with the children 
judge thomas waddell is expected to rule next week whether to 
allow experts to testify about battered spouse syndrome 
assistant state attorney bob johnson has said hell challenge any 
attempt to bring the syndrome into the case because he said there 
is no research involving homosexual relationships 
the prosecution maintains that ms julio was killed while she was 
in the closet of the mobile home the women shared ivonne julio 
was down on her knees in the closet begging for her life johnson 
told jurors tuesday 
jurors on wednesday got a glimpse of the events that night in a 
taped interview police had with ms green hours after the shooting 
the women who had been drinking had just returned from the 
party when an argument erupted and ms julio pulled out her gun 
from the closet ms green said on the tape 
ms green said she grabbed a knife that had been on a nightstand 
because she thought ms julio would kill her i was afraid she 
said there was a point i thought she was going to shoot me and i 
just ran into her and grabbed the gun 
ms green said she didnt recall firing the weapon or what 
happened to the knife but admitted to the slaying 
ms green who worked at a plant nursery last year said the 
relationship had been bad for a long time it was driving me 
nuts she said 
if convicted ms green could face life in prison

a woman who dialed 911 to report her estranged 
husband was on his way to kill her was told to call back if he 
arrived fifteen minutes later the woman and three others were shot 
to death at a birthday party 
maria delia navarro was slain sunday after being warned by a 
brotherinlaw that her husband was going to shoot up her 27th 
birthday party authorities said 
sheriff sherman block defended the 911 dispatchers actions 
wednesday 
the dispatcher did in fact function properly block said a 
news conference she did not violate any department policies or 
procedures 
it is one of those tragic situations we all wish it would have 
turned out another way but this deputy sheriff did not act 
improperly 
last january mrs navarro obtained a restraining order barring 
raymond navarro jr from going within 100 yards of her residence 
block said there was a history of violence between mrs navarro and 
her husband 
on sunday mrs navarro was warned by a brother of navarro that 
her husband was coming with a gun police said 
she dialed 911 told the dispatcher of the restraining order and 
said she believed navarro would carry out his threat of violence 
according to a transcript this exchange that followed 
deputy he hasnt come over there 
navarro no he hasnt 
deputy but hes just threatening to do so 
navarro yes and im sure he will 
deputy ok well the only thing to do is just call us if he 
comes over there i mean what can we do we cant have a unit 
sent there and wait and see if he comes over 
about 15 minutes later navarro burst into the converted garage 
mrs navarro was renting and began firing a handgun police said 
navarro 26 was charged tuesday with four counts of murder and 
two of attempted murder and prosecutors specified circumstances 
that would make him eligible for the death penalty if convicted he 
was jailed without bail 
in addition to the four dead women two people were critically 
wounded 
the sheriff expressed sympathy to the victims families but said 
the information given in the 911 call did not warrant an immediate 
response by a patrol car 
there are threats made all the time he said there is a 
difference between a threat and a clear and present danger 
block said the killings would not lead to any change in 
department policies 911 is designed primarily to deal with an 
existent emergency he said and it does that very well 
block said 700000 calls are received on 911 every year a 
quarter of them prank calls about 50000 calls come to the station 
that handled mrs navarros call and each requires a judgment call 
by the dispatcher he said 
a head of a program for battered women criticized the 911 policy 
unless the danger is imminent law enforcement doesnt give it 
a high priority said betty fisher program director at haven 
hills family violence center of san fernando valley the criteria 
for determining imminent danger should be examined

leaders of moldavia tried to placate outraged 
minorities wednesday by considering a watereddown version of 
legislation to make moldavian the official language in the 
ethnically diverse southern republic 
at the urging of president mikhail s gorbachev reports said 
the moldavians were leaning toward the compromise in an effort to 
stop strikes by ethnic russians and others opposed to the pending 
language law 
nonmoldavians were reported on strike at 200 businesses and 
industries in the small republic next to romania the official news 
agency tass said rail workers in several cities joined the walkout 
wednesday 
under the original proposal moldavian would be the only official 
language the compromise would make it the language of officials and 
documents but russian would be the everyday tongue for contact 
among ethnic groups 
in the restive baltic republics the latvian communist party 
indicated willingness wednesday to accept competing political 
parties activists reported gorbachev has repeatedly voiced 
opposition to multiple political parties 
ianis krummins deputy editor of atmoda the latvian peoples 
front newspaper said the central committee expressed support for 
eliminating a clause in the republics constitution that defines the 
communist party as the leading force of society and the political 
system 
krummins said he listened to a live radio broadcast of the 
central committee meeting in riga the latvian capital 
the clause is virtually identical to one in the soviet 
constitution that has put an effective ban on alternative parties 
for 70 years krummins said 
several small political parties have cropped in recent months 
most of them in latvia and the other two baltic republics lithuania 
and estonia 
moldavias communist party chief semen grossu suggested the 
language compromise to the legislature wednesday after speaking with 
gorbachev on the telephone tass said 
grossu did not say whether gorbachev suggested the compromise 
although but that is widely believed to be the case vasily nestase 
of the promoldavian peoples front said by telephone from the 
republics capital kishinev 
moldavia now has no language law russian traditionally has been 
the tongue for government affairs and is commonly used in commerce 
which upsets native moldavians 
the compromise would cut a part of the bill that would have made 
moldavian the language of communication among russians ukrainians 
jews bulgarians and other ethnic groups in the republic 
the initial law goes farther than the language laws in a number 
of other republics many nonmoldavians do not speak moldavian but 
they share some knowledge of russian as a result of soviet schooling 
grossu suggested adding a line in the moldavian constitution that 
would specify using russian as the language of interethnic 
communication tass reported 
peoples front activists who are backing the language law said 
they were inclined to accept grossus suggestion 
we think this is the most realistic compromise said nataly 
pascal of the peoples front in a telephone interview we support 
this compromise and were not the only ones 
the moldavian supreme soviet began debating the proposed law 
tuesday and nestase said the session would continue thursday 
gorbachev has quietly been involved in several attempts recently 
to quell unrest that has surfaced in many of the ethnically diverse 
soviet republics some of which retain strong nationalist identities 
he told the lithuanian party chief during the weekend that the 
independence movement in that former nation had gone too far 
gorbachev also worked out with other members of the ruling 
politburo a tough party statement saturday condemning nationalism 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said tuesday the 
statement by the policymaking central committee warned that 
independence movements were leading the country into an abyss 
a strike organizer in the moldavian city of tiraspol where 
russians and other minorities walked off their jobs last week to 
protest the proposed language law said strikers were willing to 
consider the compromise even though they would still prefer that 
russian and moldavian be given equal status 
the weekly moscow news on wednesday said unemployment as a factor 
in the republics unrest it said at least 150000 of the republics 
42 million people are without jobs and the number is growing 
pravda repeated earlier criticism of peoples front activists 
accusing them of spreading the seeds of separatism and 
nationalism and claiming that moldavian parliamentarians ordered 
the pravda correspondent to leave the republic 
the proposed language law also would restore the latin alphabet 
replacing the cyrillic alphabet imposed by dictator josef stalin 
after he annexed moldavia from romania in 1940 stalin imposed 
cyrillic which is used in russian to back his claim that romanians 
and moldavians are two distinct nationalities 
ethnic moldavians make up 64 percent of the republics 
population tensions between the moldavians and nonmoldavians have 
been running high since the peoples front began organizing early 
this year to push the language law and other demands to give them 
more autonomy from moscow

morning quarterbacking 
swindall told reporters tuesday that he and his siblings were all 
abused by their father nathan swindall 
he said he and his brothers kevin and philip and his sister 
theresa discussed the matter and agreed he should come forward 
he gave no details of his alleged abuse

suburbs in congress for two terms until his defeat in 1988 was

swindall was convicted june 20 of lying to a grand jury in 1988 
about negotiations for an 850000 loan from a federal agent posing 
as a drugmoney launderer

never completed swindall was convicted of perjury for denying he

having a severe case of monday morning quarterbacking barr said 
there was nothing in evidence relating to this and i dont 
believe in any pretrial evidence 
swindall provided reporters with a copy of a 1987 deposition by 
his father concerning a dispute over a loan for a family business

allegations of abuse 
swindalls sister said in an interview with the atlanta

publicly until now

its strange this wouldnt come out until theres money 
involved nathan swindall said i dont know how much he paid

japan taiwan and west germany expanded 
their imports and exports with south africa to fill the trade gap as 
south africas economy faced antiapartheid sanctions in the 
mid1980s a un report said wednesday 
a major outbreak of black unrest in south africa in 1984 was a 
pivotal event in that nations financial affairs prompting many 
us banks and corporations to dissolve their investments in south 
africa 
in 1985 new york city passed an ordinance specifying that banks 
providing city services could not extend new loans to pretoria 
but a report by the un commission on transnational 
corporations released wednesday said that although a number of 
countries have reduced their trade with south africa there is 
evidence that other corporations have filled some of this gap 
it said japan increased its imports from south africa by 455 
million in 1987 compared with the average annual level of imports 
from 198385 
in the same period taiwans imports increased by 242 million 
turkeys by 268 million and west german imports increased 187 
million 
us imports dropped 557 million in 1987 danish imports fell 
92 million and british imports were off by 91 million 
west germany increased its exports to south africa by 357 
million in 1987 compared with the annual average in 198385 the 
report said taiwans exports were up 171 million and japanese 
exports rose by 130 million 
at the same time us exports to south africa fell by 349 
million it said 
the report concluded international pressures may be applied 
through foreign trade disinvestment and foreign finance 
disinvestment is perhaps the area with the least significant 
immediate impact partly because most disinvesting companies sell 
off their plants or create other nonequity relationships 
these relationships allow for transfers of technology to the 
south african economy which are essential to the functioning of that 
economy the un report noted 
it said the electronics and automotive industries in south africa 
particularly benefited from technology transfer through equity 
links licensing trade purchase of knowhow and through the flow 
of human resources 
the report cited a news release from ford after its disinvestment 
from south africa as an example of the irrelevance of equity 
relationships to the transfer of vital technology 
ford passed along its equity in samcor the south african local 
ford plant to the local work force 
the un report quotes ford as saying afterward ford will 
continue to provide samcor with necessary components licensed use 
of the ford trademark and management and technical assistance as 
needed

an international conference on cambodia could not 
produce an agreement and suspended its work wednesday until warring 
factions are ready for a compromise to end a generation of violence 
we need time so the spirit of reconciliation can overcome the 
spirit of confrontation but for cambodia the hour of peace will 
come roland dumas the french foreign minister told the 
delegates just before adjourning the final session 
some delegates said the failure increased the likelihood of 
fullscale civil war when vietnam withdraws its military forces 
sept 27 after nearly 11 years of occupation 
lastminute negotiations delayed a final statement by seven 
hours it fell far short of the comprehensive settlement delegates 
from 19 nations hoped to achieve when the conference opened in late 
july 
the statement said the meeting achieved progress in elaborating 
a wide variety of elements necessary for the reaching of a 
comprehensive settlement to the tragic conflict in cambodia but 
added it is not yet possible to achieve a comprehensive 
settlement it was therefore decided to suspend the conference 
france and indonesia offered to help mediate between the 
vietnamsponsored government of premier hun sen and the 
threefaction rebel alliance led by prince norodom sihanouk who 
ruled cambodia until a coup in 1970 
we will come back to paris sihanouk said as he left the 
conference hall the problem is complicated we must be patient 
dumas told reporters the work of a factfinding commission sent 
to cambodia and other groundwork by the conference may pay off when 
the parties are ready to compromise 
ali alatas foreign minister of indonesia said there have 
been too many casualties too much suffering too much bitterness 
the very fact that we can sit down together i think this was 
quite a feat 
delegates left open the possiblity of using committees set up 
under conference auspices for future talks between the belligerents 
according to the final statement france and indonesia will 
begin consultations within six months with the participants in the 
conference with a view to reconvening the conference 
france called the meeting when a climate of greater cooperation 
appeared to make settlement possible but positions of the cambodian 
factions hardened during three weeks of negotiations in small 
working groups 
dumas said negotiations broke down on five points including 
composition of a transitional government how to monitor the 
withdrawal and use of the word genocide in describing khmer 
rouge rule from april 1975 until vietnam invaded in december 1978 
an estimated 1 million cambodians died under the khmer rouge 
which now is the strongest of the three rebel factions 
hun sen told reporters we know it is the khmer rouge who have 
ruined the outcome of this conference who have scuttled it 
he said the conduct of the khmer rouge and its allies suggested 
they were preparing for civil war and it confirms and presages new 
massacres of millions of cambodians 
the bush administration blamed vietnam and cambodia for the 
collapse of the peace conference and reiterated reluctant support 
for a khmer rouge role in a transitional government 
margaret tutwiler a state department spokeswoman in washington 
said it was not possible to achieve a lasting settlement due to 
the failure of the vietnamese and hun sen regime to negotiate 
constructively on key issues 
at the same time she said progress was made toward the 
important goal of a free and independent cambodia any progress is 
welcome and we should build upon it 
tommy koh spokesman for the singapore delegation said it 
will be like afghanistan after the vietnamese withdraw there 
will be more fighting the two sides are preparing for war theyre 
already fighting 
intransigence that marked the meeting throughout held up the 
final session which was scheduled to begin in the morning but was 
delayed until late afternoon 
points of disagreement included an item in a draft of the final 
statement calling for the cambodian parties to intensify efforts 
to achieve national reconciliation 
both china which supports the khmer rouge and sihanouk objected 
to the reference to national reconciliation and it was deleted 
their position remains that the government led by hun sen is 
merely a vietnamese puppet 
sihanouk said the resistance would reject any international 
monitoring of the withdrawal before the dismantling of the illegal 
regime of phnom penh and its replacement by a cambodian provisional

the security council adopted a resolution 
wednesday deploring israels deportation of arabs suspected of 
organizing the palestinian uprising the strongest action it has 
taken yet on the deportation issue 
the united states refused to use its veto power to protect 
israel and abstained the resolution passed 140 
us ambassador thomas r pickering a former ambassador to 
israel said deportations are unhelpful and provoke arabisraeli 
tension in the region 
the united states continues to feel very strongly about 
deportations pickering said after leaving the council chamber 
its a view that weve expressed many times to the government 
of israel and its a view that we expressed in our statement today 
when we abstained on the vote 
on sunday israel deported five arabs from the west bank sending 
four to lebanon and one to france 
in july the council passed a similar resolution using milder 
language saying it deeply regrets such expulsions that 
resolution also passed 140 with america abstaining 
israeli ambassador johanan bein said wordings are not 
important what is important is that at a time when carnage is going 
on in lebanon and murders are going on in the occupied territories 
the security council meets here for this nonsense and is very 
quick to act 
he added that what is disturbing is that it looks like the 
united states is giving in 
wednesdays resolution deplores the continuing deportation by 
israel the occupying power of palestinian civilians it asks 
israel to return those expelled and halt the policy 
it also asks israel to abide by the geneva convention that 
protects the rights of civilians in zones under military occupation 
bein castigated the palestine liberation organization for 
instigating the 20monthold insurrection he said israel is the 
focus of onesided security council criticism 
palestinians on dec 8 1987 began their uprising against 
israeli rule in lands occupied in the 1967 middle east war often 
stoning soldiers and israeli settlers at least 554 palestinians 
have been killed in clashes with soldiers or israeli civilians since 
then thirtyeight israelis also have been killed

more than a decade of research and 
development culminated wednesday in federal approval of a steel 
container to hold plutoniumcontaminated trash during shipment to a 
repository in new mexico 
the nuclear regulatory commission approved trupact2 which the 
energy department will use to haul waste to its waste isolation 
pilot plant a desert repository carved out of salt beds 2150 feet 
below the surface of the earth 
trupact2 a cylindrical stainlesssteel vaultwithinavault 
with 10 inches of polyurethane cushioning in between was designed 
and tested by the energy department it is manufactured by nuclear 
packaging inc of federal way wash 
this certainly is one of the critical milestones to opening the 
waste isolation pilot plant said jim tollison energy department 
manager of waste transportation for the plant 26 miles southeast of 
carlsbad 
tollison said the 10foot containers will cost about 200000 
each and the trailers to haul them about 20000 apiece 
robert neill director of the environmental evaluation group a 
federally funded state watchdog agency said of the nrcs approval 
were real pleased it passed muster 
but don hancock director of the southwest research and 
information centers nuclear waste safety project said the product 
was not adequately evaluated the organization is a private 
nonprofit watchdog group 
a longer evaulation would have included the nrc reviewing the 
quality assurance program said hancock 
tollison said the nrc had been reviewing the container program 
which had its birth in the late 1970s since 1987 
trupact stands for transuranic packaging transporter transuranic 
wastes are those contaminated with radioactive elements heavier than 
uranium the waste includes such things as gloves and tools 
each trupact2 container will hold up to 14 55gallon drums of 
radioactive waste generated by the nations weapons plants the 
trupact2 containers will be carried three at a time aboard special 
trailers to wipp 
the nrc said in a statement that the government expects to ship 
600 truckloads to wipp each year for 25 years with the trucks 
watched by satellite 
the desert repository has been built but its 1988 opening was 
postponed because of concerns about its safety delays in getting 
the land around the site withdrawn from public use and lack of 
certification for the trupact 
energy secretary james watkins has said the site wont open until 
he is sure all the technical concerns are resolved

doctors at the university of chicago have proposed 
that transplants in which only a piece of the liver is taken from a 
living donor be limited in most cases to parents supplying organs to 
their children 
the idea published in thursdays new england journal of 
medicine was offered for discussion in hopes the medical profession 
eventually will adopt such ethical guidelines 
doctors at the university of chicago drew up the rules before 
attempting their first transplant of a section of liver from a 
living donor 
transplants involving whole or partial livers taken from the dead 
are routine in many places but because these organs are in scarce 
some doctors would like to begin transplanting parts of organs taken 
from the living 
because the body has only one liver the organ cannot be entirely 
removed for transplant 
the new surgery would remove one lobe of a healthy persons liver 
and transplant it into an infant the missing part of the donors 
liver eventually grows back and in the baby the piece of organ 
grows along with the child 
we believe that from the perspectives of both recipient and 
donor the benefits outweigh the risks and that it is ethically 
appropriate to proceed with a trial of liver transplantation using a 
parent as a living donor wrote dr peter a singer and colleagues 
the guidelines resulted from a yearlong series of seminars and 
discussions 
the doctors proposed that the donor should be the childs parent 
or in rare cases a mature sibling or grandparent 
they said that when the donor is related to the recipient the 
benefits of saving a life are most rewarding such transplants also 
have the best chance of succeeding 
a team led by dr christoph broelsch of the university of chicago 
surgeons hopes to perform the first such operation in the united 
states this fall the operation has already been done in brazil 
doctors say that because of the shortage of organs from cadavers 
up to half of all babies who need new livers die while awaiting 
transplants

the number of fires set in the 
amazon rain forest has dropped from last year but the region is 
still suffering extensive damage government scientists said 
wednesday 
they say the burning increases the amount of carbon dioxide in 
the atmosphere and adds to the greenhouse effect which causes a 
global warming 
marcos pereira a researcher at the space studies institute said 
experts in the past two months detected 59000 fires that devastated 
12700 square miles of forest an area larger than maryland 
that represents roughly 15 percent of the socalled legal 
amazon a 2 millionsquaremile region 
were certainly going to have fewer fires and less destruction 
in 1989 than in 1988 primarily because weve had unusually heavy 
rains this year pereira told the associated press by telephone 
from sao jose dos campos 210 miles southwest of rio 
in 1988 about 45600 square miles were destroyed by 205000 
fires pereira said 
the institute monitors fires in the amazon by using satellites 
that detect smoke and heat 
pereira said the government helped reduce the number of fires 
mainly by suspending incentives for largescale agricultural and 
ranching projects 
it also began a plan this month to monitor part of the region by 
helicopter and fine those found guilty of clearing the forest 
illegally 
officials handed out 9 million in fines in the first 15 days 
theres a greater awareness of the problem on the part of the 
government and individuals and that will make it easier to protect 
the amazon pereira said 
ranchers and farmers burn off large tracts of the rain forest to 
clear land for planting and grazing

officials are preparing for a new wave 
of east german refugees seeking to flee to the west from hungary 
but denied on wednesday that a deal was struck to permit a wholesale 
exodus 
preparations went ahead to set up four tent camps in bavaria 
state to house an expected surge of east german refugees after sept 
1 
west german and hungarian officials say many east german families 
will have to decide whether to flee to the west or return home by 
then because it marks the end of the school vacation in east germany 
the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper said austrian and west 
german rail officials worked out plans for special trains to bring 
refugees to west germany 
chief government spokesman hans klein said the new refugee 
facilities are being erected because the government must be 
prepared for all possibilities we have to take this date of sept 1 
and the days thereafter seriously 
west german tv quoted hungarian interior minister istvan horvath 
as reiterating hungarys intention not to return any east germans 
against their will and again appealing to bonn and east berlin to 
work to solve the problem 
klein said officials estimate that from 150000 to 200000 east 
germans are on vacation in hungary officials earlier speculated as 
many as 20000 could decide to stay in hungary 
west german news media reported that 15000 east germans would be 
allowed to go the west from hungary by the weekend carrying newly 
issued west german passports 
a highranking government official in bonn speaking on condition 
of anonymity denied it and said issuing such passports would not 
solve the problem 
the new passports do not have a hungarian entry visa in them 
and thus could not be used to legally leave the country he said 
klein said news reports saying that removal of the visa 
requirement was imminent do not correspond to the facts and 
possibilities 
in vienna an austrian government source said the international 
red cross is working on a plan to ferry at least 1500 east germans 
from hungary via austria to west germany in the next few days 
west german officials said negotiations were continuing but no 
final arrangement had been concluded 
at least 6000 east germans are thought to have used vacations in 
hungary to flee west to austria since budapest began dismantling 
fortifications along the border in may 
the flood of refugees has been fueled by the refusal of the 
communist east german leadership to adopt economic and political 
reforms similar to those under way in poland and hungary

the government is trying to hold down wage increases to get a 
halt inflation that in july soared by 197 percent the projection

a man who spent 18 months behind bars for 
having oral sex with his wife was freed wednesday by a judge who 
said prosecutors would have to come up with a better reason for 
putting him in prison 
james d moseley a 35yearold carpenter believed to be the 
first man convicted under georgias 156yearold sodomy law for 
conduct between marriage partners was released from the metro 
correctional institution 
moseley who had been sentenced to five years in prison waved to 
waiting reporters as he left in a private car 
sure im bitter he said later at a news conference at the 
headquarters of the georgia chapter of the american civil liberties 
union but he said faith in humanity kept his spirits up 
i knew someone would see this thing as it really was he said 
moseley said the first thing he would do is contact the 
carpenters union about a job he said he hoped to see his sons 
although he does not have visitation rights 
he said a lengthy domestic dispute resulted in his nowformer 
wife claiming falsely that he used force to have sex with her i 
only did what she wanted me to do and then she used it against me 
to get custody of the kids moseley said 
moseley was charged with rape aggravated oral sodomy and 
aggravated anal sodomy over two encounters with bette roberts his 
commonlaw wife of four years aggravated sodomy constitutes oral or 
anal sex without consent 
moseley was acquitted of those charges but a jury found him 
guilty of sodomy without aggravation or oral or anal sex with 
consent because he admitted on the stand that he had had oral sex 
with ms roberts 
sodomy even between a consenting husband and wife is a felony 
in georgia 
on wednesday superior court judge robert castellani ordered 
moseley freed noting that he was found guilty only of an act 
involving an act between two married adults 
he said moseley must be freed on his own recognizance unless the 
state could find a reason to hold him 
clive stafford smith an american civil liberties union lawyer 
told the judge that the prosecutors should disqualify themselves if 
they ever had engaged in oral sex we cannot have a do as i say 
not as i do syndrome he argued 
the judge rejected the motion without comment 
stafford smith also argued that the georgia law violates 
constitutional rights to privacy 
but mary beth westmoreland a senior assistant attorney general 
representing the state said privacy was not at issue its not a 
matter of police peeking in windows thats not what is before this 
court she said 
she said the state became involved because ms roberts complained 
to authorities the couple who had two children have since 
divorced

south africa and backing the appalachian miners delegates to the 
evangelical church in america meeting approved a measure accusing 
israel of abusing palestinians 
the nations fourthlargest protestant denomination also urged 
participation in a burgeramonth campaign in which each person 
gives 2 a month the approximate cost of a hamburger to 
alleviate world hunger 
about 1040 delegates representing 53 million us lutherans 
expressed special support for small rural and urban congregations on 
the eighth and final day of their meeting in this chicago suburb 
in a throwaway society where new is valued more than old 
and bigger is often seen as better rural communities are in 
economic crisis and inner cities suffer blight poverty and 
flight of businesses the resolution said 
the assembly called for vigorous us efforts to determine the 
fate of us prisoners of war and those missing in action in 
vietnam and encouraged lutherans to be alert to advances in science 
and technology 
we must learn from science said the rev larry lenning of 
independence iowa 
regarding the israelipalestinian conflict the assembly said 
achieving peace required ending abuses against palestinians but 
also stressed security for the jewish state and confessed past 
sinful complicity as lutherans against jews 
the miners backed by the lutherans have been on strike against 
pittston coal group since april 5 
the assembly was the first since the january 1988 merger of the 
lutheran church in america the american lutheran church and the 
association of evangelical lutheran churches 
it demonstrated that it is right for us to be together there 
was 100 percent enthusiasim a marvelous identification of us as a 
church bishop herbert w chilstrom of chicago president of the 
denomination told a postmeeting news conference 
chilstrom said the assemblys decision to join the major 
chrisitian ecumenical bodies the world council of churches and the 
national council of churches were signs of great maturity 
he said he was impressed by the diversity of the delegates in 
addition to whites there were blacks hispanics asianamericans 
and american indians nearly half the delegates were women 
chilstrom noted that the mainly white church was established with 
a mandate to include people of different cultures weve got a 
long way to go but were on the way he said 
asked about the churchs budget crunch he predicted a turnaround 
in congregational contributions because of the mission 90 
program adopted here 
it takes a long time to turn around a ship as big as the elca 
but its going to turn around chilstrom said 
mission 90 a new longrange program for the 1990s 
emphasizes bible teaching evangelism tithing and work for peace 
justice and the environment 
following one of the most heated debates of the assembly the 
delegates earlier set a sept 1 1991 deadline for the church 
pension board to sell all shares in companies doing business in 
south africa those investments are valued at 849 million 
seting a date to be completely divested could be a problem for 
the board of pensions chilstrom said however he said all 
delegates agreed that apartheid south africas racial system of 
government must be dismantled 
another divisive issue was abortion the assembly on monday 
approved a resolution some interpreted as prochoice then 
reconsidered and decided to remain neutral on abortion pending a

tenor luciano pavarotti cancelled this seasons 
appearance with the lyric opera of chicago and was told in return 
wednesday that hes no longer welcome to perform with the company 
the famed singers manager herbert breslin told the lyric that 
a persistent inflammation of pavarottis sciatic nerve prevents him 
from performing in a live opera at this time the company said in a 
news release 
the lyric which is entering its 35th anniversary season with the 
house 99 percent sold out said the singer cancelled 26 of the 41 
performances he was under contract to do for the company this decade 
thats quite a record said lyric general director ardis 
krainik lyric opera is now unwilling to take the risk of one more 
cancellation by mr pavarotti she said 
miss krainik said the lyric is not interested in considering any 
other future engagements with pavarotti and has withdrawn from 
negotiations for performances in 1991 
she said the tenor has had a growing reputation for cancellations 
in may with the pittsburgh opera pavarotti walked off the stage 
when his voice cracked during the third act of puccinis tosca 
asked if there was any reason to think his cancellation in 
chicago was motivated by something other than health miss krainik 
said thats not the pointthe point is he cancelled 
she said she felt that with his record of cancellations she had 
no choice but to sever ties with the singer who first performed 
with the lyric in 1973 
breslin said he and pavarotti have the greatest respect for the 
lyric and miss krainik but the manager said he believes she is 
acting a little bit irrational particularly since pavarotti has 
been the greatest fund raiser in the lyrics history 
i think she gets the impression that he is doing this out of 
some kind of spite for the lyric opera of chicago which is 
absolutely wrong breslin said 
pavarotti had been scheduled to perform in tosca on six dates 
in late september and early october 
neither the lyric nor breslin would discuss the singers fees

the american humane association filed a 10 
million libel lawsuit wednesday against game show host and animal 
rights activist bob barker and others 
the lawsuit contends that barker and animal rights organizations 
have conducted a twoyear vendetta against the association and 
its west coast regional director betty denny smith said 
association attorney barry langberg ms smith also is a plaintiff 
in the lawsuit filed in superior court 
from the standpoint from the american humane association and 
betty denny smith this was a very reluctant suit said langberg 
they did not want to sue barker they want to devote their 
energies to protecting animals 
the lawsuit accuses barker the united activists for animal 
rights and its executive director nancy burnet of libel slander 
trade libel interference with prospective business relations 
conspiracy and falselight invasion of privacy said langberg 
i have no legal background but i believe that to be sued for 
these things the statements i made had to be untrue and of course 
they were not barker said in response to the lawsuit 
telephone calls seeking comment from ms burnet and the united 
activists were met with repeated busy signals 
a separate claim was filed against the city and department of 
animal regulation head robert i rush for allegedly assisting barker 
in the campaign langberg said 
i havent even seen it said rush but the conduct of this 
office in the past has been beyond reproach and it is currently 
beyond reproach the claim will be discussed with the city attorney 
and a response will be made 
langberg said the lawsuit charges that barker on radio accused 
ms smith and the association of condoning animal cruelty the 
association was founded in 1877 for the protection of animals and 
children and the west coast regional office has been active in 
protecting animals used in the entertainment industry 
barker longtime host of the television game show the price is 
right has been involved with animal rights for many years and in 
1987 quit after 19 years as host of the miss usa pageant because 
contestants wore fur coats 
he was the 1987 winner of the highest award given by directors of 
the american society for the prevention of cruelty to animals 
i have never been sued but im sure its a very unpleasant 
experience it has to be expensive and it has to be 
timeconsuming barker said but if this suit results in the 
american public becoming more aware of the extent of animal cruelty 
in entertainment then the suit will have served a very valuable 
purpose and it will be well worth the money and the time it costs

trade surplus with the united states

states kaifu said through an interpreter we will be continuing

a democratically elected government was 
supposed to take power in panama tomorrow but as president bush 
said dont hold your breath 
bush has said he sees no sign that strongman manuel antonio 
noriega will yield power voluntarily 
the panama knot is as tangled as ever on the eve of what was 
supposed to be a transfer of power to a new elected president there 
isnt any because the regime noriega dominates as commander in 
chief decreed that the elections his side lost were not going to 
count 
the organization of american states spent the summer trying to 
mediate a path to democratic government all it managed to do was 
produce a statement expressing concern that its mission had not 
succeeded and urging panamanians to work out their differences 
themselves 
when that was attempted in a may 7 election and noriegas regime 
apparently lost his government simply annulled the election returns 
after the fact for good measure noriegas paramilitary supporters 
beat opposition candidates bloody when they staged a protest march 
the oas then tried its hand rebuking noriega and sending 
emissaries to seek a peaceful transition to democratic rule in time 
for the sept 1 inauguration date set by the panamanian 
constitution noriegas side offered to share power in a provisional 
government with the general still holding his command but the 
opposition rejected that deal 
that left no deal 
the united states wants noriega out it also wants to put him on 
trial for drug trafficking under two indictments returned in florida 
in february 1988 the reagan and bush administrations have been 
trying to dislodge him ever since imposing economic sanctions 
withholding panama canal revenues and helping to finance the 
opposition campaign for the abortive elections last spring 
but noriega remains commander of the panama defense forces and 
that hold on power does not seem to have been shaken im not 
holding my breath on his voluntary departure bush told a 
midaugust news conference 
the long stalemate is a case study in the uses and constraints on 
us power in latin america even in panama where some 13000 
american troops are stationed 
bush described those limits when he said there would be no 
unilateral use of us troops to deal with the drug crisis in 
colombia 
i know enough about this hemisphere and ive had enough 
experience in dealing with countries in latin america in south 
america central america all through the caribbean to know the 
constraints that exist in terms of or should exist in terms of 
dispatching troops he said at a news conference on aug 23 those 
constraints apply in panama too 
playing on latin american sensitivities noriega constantly 
complains that the united states is intervening interfering and 
bent on rescinding the treaties under which panama will take over 
the panama canal in 1999 
the oas mediation team criticized the united states for 
conducting military maneuvers in panama this summer saying that had 
a negative effect on its effort to negotiate a transfer of power 
the united states said other oas nations should join in isolating 
the noriegabacked government that apparently will continue in 
power assistant secretary of state lawrence eagleburger called it 
an outlaw regime 
eagleburger said noriega is allied with cocaine traffickers in 
aggression as surely as adolf hitlers invasion of poland 50 years 
ago was aggression 
bush has left open the possibility that noriega might somehow be 
seized if he is not extradited we have an indictment out against 
gen noriega for drug trafficking he said on aug 15 im told 
that its a good indictment 
im not saying what i would do or wouldnt do i have an 
obligation to try to bring people to justice 
bush has said that the united states will continue to support 
what the people of panama voted for in their aborted election 
the question is how the presidents most recent answer was that 
he didnt know for sure 
pressure for tougher us action is certain to increase in 
congress and elsewhere there already are proposals in congress to 
suspend or abrogate the panama canal treaties the administration 
reportedly is considering stiffened economic sanctions and there is 
always military option 
sol m linowitz who negotiated the canal treaties says oas 
mediation remains the right course to date the negotiating 
efforts of the oas have been proceeding fitfully but the reports 
from the negotiating table give some reason for hope he wrote 
in the washington post 
he said that effort should get more time 
the bush administration has made a good start toward addressing 
the crisis in panama by encouraging a regional diplomatic 
solution linowitz wrote we should stick with it

the borders blurring effect on language and 
culture is apparent in signs sprinkling laredos crowded downtown 
shopping district madre india ropa hindu bombay 
connection and casa hari 
in the past decade an enclave of merchants from india has 
established itself in the nations most hispanic city spanish and 
english meld with hindi sindhi gujarati and other tongues from the 
indian subcontinent 
on the back wall of ramesh tewanis madre india no 2 jewelry 
store on zaragoza street is a prominent figure of ganesh the hindu 
god of good luck tewani came to the united states from india and 
moved to laredo in 1977 about the same time other indians began 
converging on the border city 
what brought me to the us business said tewani who sells 
gold and italian jewelry the mexicans come and they buy gold from 
me in large quantities 
his 20yearold son mohan tewani runs the madre india no 1 
featuring highfashion costume jewelry just a few blocks down the 
same street 
more than 90 percent of their business comes from mexicans who 
survey the retail selections before making their own large wholesale 
purchases say the tewanis and other indian merchants on juarez and 
zaragoza streets they say they found success in laredo and spread 
the word to other indians 
many of the mexican customers smuggle the goods into mexico to 
get by their countrys tariffs and trade restrictions the indian 
merchants say 
mayor aldo tatangelo a retailer remembers a wave of indians 
just coming and coming and coming in the early 1980s to set up a 
gold trade 
i call it the gold city because theres so much gold in 
there the indians are good in jewelry its very important to them 
and theyve got good connections with the factories in italy 
tatangelo estimated that jewelry stores now dominated by 
indians sell as much as 500 million in gold to mexicans shopping 
in laredo others have moved into other lines including cheaper 
jewelry electronics and clothing 
as a result more than a few indians live in the fashionable del 
mar c and regency park neighborhoods on the citys north side 
while the indian immigrants have adapted to the us and mexican 
cultures there is also an effort to preserve some of their roots 
the india association of laredos 33 families meet regularly for 
a dose of culture on sunday aug 13 they met at ramesh tewanis 
house for a katha or thanksgiving prayer session afterwards 
they raised the indian flag to celebrate indias independence day a 
letter sent to members written in english concluded with the 
message viva indian independence 
association president kishin rupani owner of dayasons costume 
jewelry amp gifts said the group helps maintain a closeknit 
community indian singers and entertainers touring the united states 
sometimes are paid to make side trips to perform at members homes 
the association usually meets at homes because there is no indian 
temple or movie theater 
as with most immigrants however identification with the new 
country increases with the time here particularly among the young 
mohan tewani has a shrine in the back of his store but is unsure 
of the names of hindu gods revered there my father would be the 
expert on that 
command of the various native languages also is weakening 
ultimately they have to blend in with the society said 
rupanis daughter soma a banking and finance major at laredo 
junior college 
actually we are americanized in a way but were more 
conservative with dating and things like that said soma rupani 
21 youve heard of the arranged marriages you have to stay 
within your community 
some parents still arrange their childrens marriages she said 
but even that institution has been liberalized by time in a new 
country 
twentysix years ago rupani didnt meet somas mother until they 
were engaged 
today i will know the guy but the one they approve of is the 
one i will marry said soma rupani thats how we have changed a 
little 
andy lakhiani moved to laredo four years ago after nearly being 
killed by an armed robber in his former shop in dallas nearly every 
square inch of his small store casa hari on juarez street is 
packed with of plastic necklaces earrings scarves goldfilled 
jewelry perfumes sunglasses clocks purses and other merchandise 
destined primarily for south of the border 
lakhiani originally from bombay said his three children dont 
recognize indian culture but he doesnt care its good to be 
aware of roots but you have to adapt you have to blend in he 
said as a radio behind the counter played music from a station

centers and talked to counselors before starting a summerlong story 
about date rape on the cbs daytime serial the young and the 
restless 
the story followed the rape of her character fashion model 
cricket blair by her boyfriend played by ken olandt and his 
subsequent trial 
weve just finished the trial and the jury was about to turn 
him loose when my brother found another girl he had raped on a 
college campus said bell 20 the judge allowed us to bring in 
the new witness i just got a script where i tell the college 
officials that if theyd listened to her i wouldnt have been 
raped 
the trial ended last week with his conviction on a charge of rape 
bell went to the los angeles commission on violence against women 
and treatment centers where she talked to rape victims and 
counselors 
this is a good story to do in the summer when a lot of students 
are home said bell the people i talked to said the incidence 
of date rape on college campuses is going up and up i was just on a 
personal appearance in oklahoma where two women told me they had 
friends who reported rapes after seeing our show 
she said the boyfriend in the show gave little indication that he 
would attack her 
he was the handsome allamerican boy she said he was 
always looking after me youd never suspect the only sign was that 
he was a touchyfeely kind of person 
weve stressed that you should learn about a person and when 
you go on a date set your limits right away weve tried to make it 
realistic so girls will know what to expect if it should happen to 
them 
the young and the restless the toprated daytime soap opera 
does a major story aimed at young people every summer in past years 
theyve done stories on alcoholism teenage pregnancy and aids

and the restless her characters mother has aids and earlier this 
year she learned her fiance is actually her brother and his father 
is actually her father 
bell whose own father is the boss of the toprated soap opera 
has been with the show full time for the past two years she made 
her first appearance at 9 and at 13 began making regular appearances 
as cricket whenever she had time off from school 
the audience liked it because theyd never seen someone so 
young grow up on a show before said bell i became a teen model 
for the cosmetics company thats the focus of the show the children 
of viewers could watch me and get tips on makeup the message was 
dont overdo your makeup but i didnt buy that myself i went 
through the makeup phase too

the family lives in a large compound in the hollywood hills the 
bells moved here only a few years ago after writing and producing 
the show from chicago 
it was great that my father was the producer but you have to 
work twice as hard lauralee says people expect you to come in 
and be this obnoxious little thing i never complained about my work 
schedule i never complained about my hair or makeup i worked hard 
to prove myself i dont run to my father and i dont carry tales

it looks as though there is plenty of reason for 
optimism heading into the traditional business new year at labor 
day 1989 
the holiday was established 95 years ago as a national event 
honoring working people a special moment of respite from toil 
but over the decades it also has evolved into a time for planning 
and launching new efforts toward progress and achievement a rolling 
up of sleeves and getting back to work after the diversions of 
summer 
by most accounts the circumstances that prevail heading into the 
last four months of 1989 are about as favorable as they ever get in 
any piece of machinery as diverse and complex as the us economy 
there hasnt been a recession in nearly seven years and 
predictions of the likely time of the next downturn have lately been 
pushed back again 
revised figures issued by the government this week showed the 
economy growing at a 27 percent annual rate after adjustment for 
inflation in the second quarter of the year up from an earlier 
estimate of 17 percent 
faced with that kind of evidence fears have been fading fast 
that the federal reserves campaign to restrain inflation would 
result in any sort of severe business slump 
the inflationfighting mission appears meanwhile to have met 
with at least some shortterm success the consumer price index rose 
at a 02 percent annual rate in both june and july half the pace it 
set over the previous five months 
the producer price index of finished goods which provides a 
measure of subsurface inflationary pressures has been falling 
recently as have prices of most raw commodities 
there was no widespread drought this year as there was in 1988 
to put pressure on supplies and prices of farm products world oil 
prices havent made any menacing moves of late 
economic data released during july and august suggest that the 
economy is in a phase of disinflationary growth a combination of 
rising growth and declining inflation that typically occurs during 
periods of economic recoveries observed anthony vignola and 
stephen gallagher analysts at the investment firm kidder peabody amp 
co 
sensitive economic indicators all point to a strengthening 
economy 
along with its benefits however that prospect poses some 
problems if the economy is going to keep chugging along the 
chances would logically be reduced for a further decline in interest 
rates 
that in turn would stand as a setback for many of the numerous 
people and businesses carrying heavy debt burdens these days as 
well as for those who hoped cheaper mortgages would help them buy or 
sell a house 
a stronger economy also would imply that the federal reserve 
might go back to restrictive inflationfighting after a recent 
period of stimulating the banking system with a shot of 
antirecession medicine 
nevertheless many analysts say it is worth remembering that 
through most of the 1980s the american economy has tended to reward 
the optimists while punishing those who bet on bad times 
the economy got off to a good start for the current quarter 
stated paul boltz financial economist at the investment management 
firm t rowe price associates if july is any indication the 
likelihood of a recession looks small this year 
to be sure a boom does not look in prospect either but a soft 
landing followed by a slow takeoff should keep washington 
policymakers satisfied

gene cowell and his family were hooked on the 
pristine beaches lush tropics and spectacular sunsets of barbados 
and nine years ago they did what most vacationers only dream about 
they set up house there 
but their 60000 onebedroom waterfront condominium off the 
beaten path was anything but paradise 
we were uncomfortable with some of the aspects of living in 
barbados that tourists wouldnt necessarily be aware of said 
cowell an advertising executive from guilford conn it was a lot 
more crowded than we thought there were social problems and 
high taxes 
many others intoxicated by an idyllic overseas stay this summer 
could end up as unhappy as the cowells whove since sold their 
barbados condo for one elsewhere in the caribbean international 
real estate experts and vacationersturnedproperty owners warn all 
potential buyers to use their heads not their emotions when making 
such foreign investments 
you have to do your research said jeanne begg president of 
begg international a washington real estate firm with listings in 
europe and the caribbean 
cowell used his experience to set up island properties report a 
monthly research publication that provides tips on buying real 
estate in the caribbean and the bahamas and lists available 
property the publication costs 2 a copy a sample copy is free 
for the more adventurous the key largo fla publication 
private islands unlimited provides a listing of islands for sale 
around the world ranging from a small undeveloped isle off belize 
selling for 15000 to fullscale resorts for around 10 million 
the annual fee is 25 
wherever you might be looking dont expect many bargains the 
world has become small enough so that people dont get the bargains 
they used to get said mrs begg 
in europe especially real estate has appreciated at about the 
same staggering rate as with many us properties a home in 
londons docklands section near the thames river which cost around 
20000 20 years ago now fetches more than 10 times that price 
paris is out of sight added mrs begg noting that a flat in 
that city is just as expensive as in manhattan you might be able 
to get good deals in unchic places 
mrs begg recommends that those seriously considering buying 
vacation property abroad spend as much time in that country as they 
can particularly in the off season to get a feel for local life 
and to check out essentials like water availability renting first 
is also suggested 
each country has its own restrictions and laws that should be 
reviewed with a local attorney some such as italy dont allow 
foreigners to take profits from the sale of their property out of 
the country others like mexico prevent outsiders from actually 
owning land near the coast or the border 
in the caribbean many countries impose a foreign purchase or 
alien landowners tax of about 10 percent of the purchase price 
when you buy and 8 percent when you sell 
foreign banks also have their own set of restrictions and most 
wont give you a mortgage experts say while us banks will 
provide money for foreign home purchases most prefer a hefty down 
payment of around 30 percent to 50 percent they say 
experts say a homeequity loan may be the best way to finance a 
second home overseas 
like secondhome mortgages the interest is deductable no matter 
where you buy providing the value of your primary and secondary 
homes dont exceed 11 million said jack rodman managing director 
for kenneth leventhal amp co a los angeles accounting firm 
specializing in real estate but he warns that to receive a full 
deduction you can only borrow 100000 above the value of your 
existing mortgage 
to help offset expenses some people rent out their foreign 
properties however cowell warns you should be prepared to share 
part of that income with the locals youll have to hire to clean or 
manage the property 
you also should be prepared for delays whether in closing the 
deal or renovating property 
in many countries time is not of the essence said donald 
ward publisher of private islands unlimited building supplies 
may also be limited 
fern pomerantz of cleveland ohio who subscribes to cowells 
island properties report can vouch for that she recently wrote in 
the newsletter that it took 1 years to build a house on property 
she bought in st kitts and even after it was completed she had to 
put up with a few minor inconveniences 
the surprise of discovering 20 cows outside our window each 
morning necessitated the immediate construction of a fence 
she said

trust is a basic attitude of religious people 
who also stress open acceptance of strangers these traits make them 
particularly vulnerable to swindlers 
thats the thrust of a report by the north american securities 
administrators and the council of better business bureaus 
based on a survey of cases from state securities agencies the 
report finds an alarming increase in the number of investment 
schemes peddled to religious people 
organizers of such swindles appeal to the high level of trust 
often found in religious groups and communities 
titled preying on the faithful the false prophets of the 
investment world the report says more than 15000 americans have 
lost more than 450 million in such scams in the last five years 
a growing number of investment swindlers and other sharp 
operators play on religious beliefs in order to gain the trust 
confidence and life savings of the faithful the report says 
it details major cases in 15 states where operators usually 
feigning religious motives and sometimes claiming godendowed 
business talents gained confidence of believers and their cash 
the sharp increase in such operations has resulted in a surge 
in statelevel complaints from consumers about fraud and abuse by 
selfproclaimed born again financial planners the report says 
it says they often pretend to be endorsed by local or national 
church officials or to offer divinely inspired investment advice 
about coins precious metals real estate and oil and gas well 
programs 
john c baldwin director of the utah division of securities and 
president of the north american securities administrators 
association says 
it now appears that religiously oriented swindles are one of 
todays hottest tickets for investment con artists 
the problem here is not religion but the growing number of con 
artists who are cynically exploiting religious faith in order to 
fleece unsuspecting members of the flock 
james h mcilhenny president of the council of better business 
bureaus says the religious swindler feigns interest in religious 
beliefs only insofar as they can be used to run a scam 
they will go to any lengths including the exploitation of 
churches and deeply held religious beliefs if they think it will 
work they will take their 30 pieces of silver any way they can get 
them 
baldwin describes this common mode of operation 
a con artist picks some religiously identifiable group passes 
himself off as a member in order to put victims at ease they in 
turn often drop their guard and fail to check out him or the 
socalled investment opportunity 
baldwin said the approaches usually are much the same but the 
promoted investments may be almost anything he said one outfit used 
old testament prophecy to pinpoint spots for oil wells in israel 
many con artists advertise their services in religious 
publications and on christian radio stations he says while 
others obtain religious mailing and telephone lists and use direct 
mail and coldcall tactics 
some operate on a facetoface basis renting church 
basements or making appearances before church social groups he 
says these schemes with the personal touch seem to hit the 
elderly hardest 
whenever a religiously oriented scam starts to unravel baldwin 
says the con artist often claims authorities were trying to ruin 
or embarrass the faith or church 
frequently this tactic gives the con artist the time he needs 
to move to the next congregation baldwin says this can also 
delay complaints to state agencies so long that his trail is too 
cold to follow 
baldwin emphasizes that the fiveyear estimate of more than 
15000 americans losing more than 450 million includes only 
largescale religious scams each with losses exceeding 500000 
and not smaller swindles 
offering tips for avoiding such scams the report lists various 
danger signs including 
investments that seem closely tied to a particular religious 
belief 
an investment promoter who tries to capitalize on status or 
influence in a particular religious group 
a new member turns up with a sure fire investment scheme 
any investments promoted by fellow church members since the 
most persuasive hook of con artists is to get testimony of

with aids appearing in many countries the 
national council of churches is expanding efforts to inform 
missionaries about the virus and how to reduce risks of contracting 
it 
member denominations are being provided with educational 
materials special sterilized injection kits and other resources for 
missionaries as they are sent to their fields 
the risk of aids is real for missionaries serving in infected 
areas but not very high if a person takes precautions says dr 
john frame ncc consultant on health affairs 
of 40000 american protestant missionaries serving overseas six 
are known to have been infected with the aids virus four of them 
stationed in africa and two in the caribbean 
another missionary a hemophiliac infected through a transfusion 
died of aids in australia frame says 
the risk to missionaries is almost certainly related to 
profession medical or events that cannot be predicted such as 
accident or complications in pregnancy requiring blood 
transfusions he says 
there is also the risk of getting an injection from 
inadequately sterilized equipment

a professor at southern baptist union 
university has resigned in a conflict with the administration over 
his teaching that a saved believing christian can fall into 
unbelief and be lost 
the universitys administration had cut teaching duties and 
salary of the rev clyde tilley a religion and philosophy professor 
at the school for a quarter century because of his views on the 
issue 
tilley says the case was part and parcel of the broader 
conflict among southern baptists whose denominational offices have 
become dominated by a fundamentalist wing 
hyran barefoot the universitys president says tilley didnt 
hold to the baptist doctrine of eternal security of the 
believer that a person once saved is always saved 
tilley says he agrees that all believers are eternally 
secure but that people can revert into unbelief and deliberately 
renounce salvation he says this view is compatible with the 
eternal security of the believer since the apostate would no longer 
be a believer 
a faculty affairs committee recommended that tilley be retained 
in his regular post at the same pay but this was not accepted by 
the schools trustees mostly appointed by the denominations 
fundamentalist leaders

for fuad abboud and his family in 
christian east beirut it is a triumph just to get through the day 
they are without water and electrity and have little fuel for 
cooking because of almost constant syrian bombardment and a blockade 
of supplies 
even the most mundane daytoday chores washing dishes cooking 
meals doing the shopping taking showers are a challenge 
most of beiruts 15 million people christians and moslem alike 
have fled 
but the abboud family and thousands like them stay on in 
beirut keeping the citys pulse beating however faintly clinging 
tenaciously to the splinters of their lives despite the catastrophe 
that has befallen them 
i dreamt we had electricity last night said 13yearold 
rania abboud in my dream i even saw light streaming from one of 
the rooms 
she awakened from her dream and half asleep got up to turn on 
the stereo she hasnt played for weeks 
then i realized that the light came from the candle she said 
softly 
in rania abbouds dream the electricity had come back on 
fuad abboud 60 a calligrapher for a publishing house his wife 
hiyam 47 rania and her 17yearold brother rabih live in 
hazmieh one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in east beirut 
they live on the second floor of a fivestory apartment block 
near the green line that divides the city into christian and moslem 
sectors the front line in lebanons 14yearold civil war 
the area has been heavily shelled by the syrian army in its 
5monthold battle with christian militias 
some nights the shells fall in a torrent like rain abboud 
said 
every building around them has been hit at least once theirs has 
not luckily its surrounded by taller buildings 
joseph abujaouden one of their neighbors went to the bakery 
for bread one recent morning during a lull in the shelling on his 
way home he was killed in a surprise barrage 
the abbouds water taps are dry their beds unused because its 
too dangerous to sleep in them the refrigerator serves as a 
cupboard the washing machine is silent the lights out the 
television dark 
water and electricity were cut off months ago 
mrs abboud hides her jewelry in a neighbors pressure cooker 
its the last place i think thieves would look she said 
she has moved her favorite dresses from her bedroom in the outer 
exposed part of the building to a hallway in the apartment for 
safety 
not that she wears them anyway social life stopped months ago 
no one goes out unless they have to 
mrs abboud doesnt bother with makeup any more and usually wears 
a loose anklelength arabic gown known as an abaya around the 
apartment 
ive forgotten what its like to be a woman she said 
a widow fadwa azar and her son in the apartment next door have 
a gasolinefueled generator on their balcony that runs their 
refrigerator television set and other appliances the abbouds keep 
their essential foods in mrs azars refrigerator 
the abbouds long for cold drinks no room for soft drinks in 
mrs azars refrigerator a hot meal is rare the family hasnt 
tasted ice cream or chilled fruit since the fighting broke out march 
8 
the abbouds apartment block doesnt have an underground shelter 
as many buildings do so most nights the abbouds sleep squeezed 
together on mattresses and quilts on the floor of a stuffy 
unventilated hall in mrs azars apartment at the rear of the 
building less vulnerable to the shelling from the moslem west side 
our life is dictated by the whims of the fighters mrs 
abboud said we sleep and we eat and we go to work when they allow 
us 
most fearsome are the 240mm and 180mm mortars the syrians fire 
the heavycaliber weapons were designed to knock out underground 
military bunkers bridges and airstrips but theyre being used 
against apartment and office buildings causing awesome damage and 
many casualties 
theyre a nightmare said son rabih we almost dont mind 
what the syrians fire any more except those damned 240s and 180s 
on one recent day the abbouds were awakened at 5 am theyre 
usually not early risers but the rumble of fighting along the green 
line made sleep impossible and they headed for the hallway in mrs 
azars apartment 
the fighting subsided two hours later the abbouds wearily 
returned to their apartment sticky from the humid summer heat 
rubbing cramped legs and stiff necks the temperature reaches 95 
degrees during the day this time of year in beirut 
id give anything anything for one week of sleeping in my own 
bed mrs abboud said with a sigh

everyone had to wash with just half a bucket of water 
mrs abboud said they once went without washing for four days 
because the shelling was so heavy no one could go out to fetch water 
from a spring in the neighboring ashrafieh district a constant 
target for the syrians 
when theres gasoline to be found and the shelling stops rabih 
drives through the rubblestrewn streets to fill six 10liter 
2gallon plastic canisters with water from the spring 
his mother frets while hes out praying hell get home before 
the shelling starts again 
the family needs about 13 gallons of water a day for drinking 
washing dishes bathing flushing toilets and keeping the house 
clean 
mrs abboud has learned to wash the dishes in a bucket then use 
the water to flush the toilet 
many beirutis use bottled water for showers one woman said 
i use one for the front and another for the back 
the abbouds use the water sparingly trying to keep some in 
reserve for the days when the shelling is heavy and rabih cant go 
to the spring 
at 8 am one recent day mrs abboud sent rania to fetch cheese 
milk and yoghurt from mrs azars collective fridge 
rania returned emptyhanded mrs azar was out and rania couldnt 
get into her apartment the abbouds made do with stale bread dipped 
in olive oil and thyme 
abboud goes to the local bakery if its open three days a week 
at 5 am on a good day hell have to wait in line only an hour 
sugar is in short supply to rabihs chagrin he likes his tea 
sweet 
after breakfast abboud looked out the window at the street below 
when i see people in the street i reckon its safe to go to 
work said abboud whose office is a 10minute walk from his 
apartment 
there was some traffic this day so he made a run for it he wore 
a wrinkled shirt because with no electricity his wife cant iron 
clothes 
after he left his wife fidgeted nervously until he telephoned to 
say hed arrived safely 
abboud earns 80000 lebanese pounds 160 a month at calligraphy 
and unlike many lebanese gets paid regularly he supplements his 
salary with freelance work at home his eldest son fadi 26 who 
works in liberia in western africa regularly sends money home 
asked why he hasnt taken the family out of beirut abboud said 
moslem forces are near his cottage in the mountains at bikfaya and 
it is just as exposed to shellfire as the beirut apartment he 
doesnt think theres much difference where the family lives 
as for fleeing abroad i cant afford it he said 
schools have been closed for five months but rabih and his 
sister do school work at home and turn it in to their teachers every 
two weeks when they receive new assignments 
their father nags them to study for two hours a day but rabih 
said its really hard because i just cant concentrate 
mrs abboud makes sure everyones there when she prepares a meal 
because gas for cooking is scarce and she doesnt want to waste it 
to reheat food 
she buys gas for the stove in a container that once cost the 
equivalent of 150 and now sells for 16 
as mrs abboud was making lunch this day hazmieh came under 
shellfire again 
the family ended up eating halfcooked french fries in the 
stairwell as the steaks lay uncooked on the kitchen table 
when the shelling intensified the abbouds scurried to mrs 
azars apartment the fetid air and the constant pounding of 
exploding shells made everyone jittery 
at nightfall the shelling eased and the abbouds groped their way 
back to their apartment in the dark to make sandwiches before 
returning to their bedroom in mrs azars apartment 
rabih held a large bottle of pepsi and said longingly if only 
you were ice cold 
at 8 pm mrs azar turned on her television set to watch the 
evening news on the christian network 
everyone listened intently to learn which areas had been hit 
whod been killed 
the newscaster started on the foreign news 
switch it off mrs azar said curtly the world doesnt 
care about us why should we care whats happening to them

as he stretched his long legs before a 
class 18yearold duncan cooper recalled some of the less glamorous 
moments in his 13 years of ballet training 
when i was younger id get called a sissy he said i 
mean ballets not like the national pastime its not like 
football its not a thing thats in and its not a source of 
national pride like it is in europe ive been beaten up before 
when i was in junior high here in san francisco 
but thats not the important thing the important thing is that 
im doing what i want to do and its something im good at and no 
one can take that away from me 
coopers devotion is a rare thing and it has just paid a 
magnificent bonus he has been accepted into the company of the san 
francisco ballet for the 1990 season 
like so many other aspiring and talented dancers cooper studied 
at the san francisco ballet school many of the students are lured 
from area public schools for that chance at dance fame 
charles mcneal scouts schools for the company interviewing 
children who in all likelihood have never even seen a ballet 
performed relying on experience and a little luck he carefully 
selects youngsters to invite to the san francisco ballet school to 
determine if they might be destined to follow in the footsteps of 
pavlova or nijinsky 
we try to identify students who have the talent who can 
experience the joy of dance he said the first thing to look 
for is a spark in the eye that one little spark is what we nurture 
along the way 
then theres the basics the physicality the feet the limbs 
a good jumper and the musicality you develop a keen eye but 
you cannot look at an 8yearold and know if he will become a 
professional dancer 
students selected by mcneal and scores of others auditioned 
through more traditional methods find a rare opportunity at the 
school whose mission is nothing less than to prepare its students 
for a career in ballet 
hundreds of schools across the country teach ballet but only a 
few are affiliated with major companies the san francisco ballet 
school ranks among the best with a new multimilliondollar facility 
top instructors and a close tie to helgi tomassons critically 
acclaimed company 
students need enough talent to get in enough spirit to compete 
enough stamina to sustain them and enough love for ballet that 
theyd gladly give up many of the joys of youth for a chance to 
dance 
mcneal says only one in 100 of the 8yearolds will ever dance 
professionally and only half of those will dance with a major 
company 
the school also auditions about 2000 dancers in 15 cities each 
year to find the 140150 students for its sixweek intensive summer 
program 
we select them because they show us some potential for 
professional careers by virtue of their physique their prior 
training their desire their discipline that sort of thing said 
nancy johnson carter who danced with the san francisco ballet 
before becoming the schools manager 
a few summer students are invited to stay at the school at the 
end of the session still others come to the school after first 
studying ballet elsewhere in the san francisco bay area 
however they get there each student seems to have caught 
ballet fever in a unique way maybe their mother took them to 
the nutcracker on a rainy afternoon perhaps they saw mikhail 
baryshnikov dance on television some started by studying tap or 
jazz whatever got them started the result is the same they all 
have the passion to dance 
thats not to say every 8yearold in the building has decided 
to be a professional ballet dancer carter said they dont make 
that decision until theyre a teenager usually 
however no matter what else we teach them our main goal is to 
make them professional ballet dancers 
students who start at age 8 soon learn how serious a challenge 
they face 
and it becomes more serious very rapidly carter said in 
their first year of study they take two classes a week thats an 
hour and a half a class by the second year theyre here three 
times a week by the third year now theyre 10 or 11 years old 
theyre here three times a week but theyre taking six lessons by 
the fourth year it goes to eight 
that means a child of 11 or 12 is taking 12 hours of class a week 
after school through the teen years the training intensifies 
forcing students to skip pep rallies parties and afterschool 
activities but the students know they have to train if they want 
the rewards of a dance career 
their parents might think theyre sacrificing said carter 
certainly my parents thought i was missing out on a lot but i 
also traveled the world three or four times with a ballet company 
and went to places my contemporaries have yet to go 
you have the experiences of dancing for kings and queens its 
such a different kind of life and the rewards are so great that 
i dont know that dancers consider it a sacrifice 
certainly dominique young doesnt the 14yearold has been 
dancing for seven years and last year performed as clara in the 
companys staging of the nutcracker 
my mother was a dancer for a while and i saw pictures of her 
dancing and i thought how wonderful it was and i went to see the 
nutcracker and i loved it she said if you have a strong will 
to become a dancer it really can come true 
former student paul gibson 20 graduated from the school and was 
welcomed into the company last year he started dancing jazz at age 
6 switched to ballet at 13 and never regretted it for a moment 
its not a long career like other fields where you can go into 
your 60s or 70s but its a great career with traveling and just 
being out on stage he said

with the death of conductor herbert von 
karajan the salzburg festival is changing its image to open up the 
celebrated cultural event to new forms of art and musicians whove 
never been invited to play 
the festival has become an old museum unaware of whats going 
on artistically in the world we should give modern music and drama 
the place they deserve said hans landesmann a member of the 
festival board in an interview 
there is no crisis but just time for change this necessity has 
been in the air for years 
gerard mortier director of the brussels opera was recently 
named artistic director of the salzburg festival with a mandate to 
revamp the cultural showcase 
for years the festival had been criticized for being too 
expensive and a storehouse of the artistic totems of karajan its 
longtime guiding spirit who died july 16 of a heart attack at age 81 
the fiveweek festival opened july 27 with giuseppe verdis opera 
un ballo in maschera under the baton of sir georg solti 
karajan had been criticized for his domineering and conservative 
stance italian media called the festival an intrigue nest 
totally subordinated to karajans commercial interests 
in his long career karajan made more than 800 recordings many 
of them with the berlin and vienna orchestras his fortune was 
estimated at 35 billion schillings 270 million although he 
resigned from the fivemember directorate last august after an 
illness he had retained a veto over virtually all productions 
landesmann a wealthy vienna businessman with international 
contacts was asked by the government to work out a reform program 
in june before karajans death the board overruling him agreed 
in principle to landesmanns plan to modernize festival management 
under the plan to be formally adopted in fall the unpaid honorary 
fiveman directorate will be replaced by a permanent salaried 
threemember board 
the new board comprising a president an artistic director and 
an economic director will work full time for the festival 
landesmann said 
we need new forwardthinking people in the management much 
more aware of the contemporary scene he said 
albert moser the festival president and a karajan loyalist who 
is to retire in 1991 will also be replaced 
in another major change landesmann said he would like to include 
artists in the new artistic advisory board to counsel on new 
projects he would also like to see more film and video galas and 
exhibits to be staged during the festival the worlds 
longestrunning and most costly one 
while not playing down the merits of italian traditional operas 
which have been performed here every year landesmann proposes to 
include other composers such as richard strauss or alban berg the 
austrian artist who combined atonality with the lyric and dramatic 
features of the viennese romantic tradition 
there is talk among festival organizers to devote the 2600seat 
great festival hall to foreign classical opera and the little 
festival hall to mozart productions 
we want a repertoire consistent with the line of mozarts 
heritage something specific typical of salzburg landesmann said 
in an attempt to prevent the rise of another domineering maestro 
such as karajan landesmann said no permanent conductor will be 
named but invitations will go out to such wellknown figures as 
solti ricardo muti claudio abbado or sir john pritchard all of 
whom were in austria this summer 
karajan was opposed to reforms he was an old man and he didnt 
like changes he was opposed to see new people and he used to ask 
why should we change the structure of the festival landesmann 
said 
karajan a native of salzburg who had conducted at the festival 
since 1948 was its sole artistic director in 195660 and a member 
of the directorate since 1964 
now in its 69th year the salzburg festival pays some of the 
highest performer fees in europe and charges some of the 
continents top ticket prices 
five years ago government auditors urged festival organizers to 
spend less press chief hans widrich said the festival runs an anual 
budget of 27 million of which state subsdies total 77 million 
with the rest coming from ticket sales radio and tv rights 
ticket sales this year range from 4 for standing room at a 
concert of sacred music to 250 for the best seat at one of the 
opera performances 
however not all agree on the need for reform 
solti musical director of the chicago symphony orchestra who 
replaced karajan for the verdi opera said the ticket prices should 
stay as they are 
i dont believe that lowering their price and making them cost 
10 schillings 77 cents apiece would solve anything all hotel 
doormen will rush to buy them officially and then resell them on the 
black market at a high profit he said 
solti said he was not concerned about the artistic quality of the 
festival which he considers very good 
politicians are talking too much once its quality goes down 
then you can say hey we must change something but not for the 
time being he said 
british film director john schlesinger who staged verdis opera 
on the opening night praised salzburg saying there is no house 
in the world offering the kind of facilities expertise and 
officialdoms support we get here we dont think we will find again 
similar conditions

the governments leading wildlife official 
says kenyas game parks remain safe despite four fatal attacks since 
july including the slaying of conservationist george adamson 
richard leakey the director of wildlife blamed the attacks on 
elephant poachers who have turned to banditry after being driven out 
of the animal reserves by kenyas campaign to save its elephant 
population 
he noted that the three fatal attacks before adamson was slain 
aug 20 took place in particularly remote areas and far from the 
usual tourist or safari trails 
his death and the killings of a connecticut woman and a french 
couple in july raised fears for the health of kenyas tourist 
industry the countrys no 1 income earner 
but leakey said he saw no reason for visitors to fear for their 
safety so long as they stay in regular tourist areas and on main 
roads 
i have traveled widely in the last few weeks to assess the 
situation for myself he said after adamsons death most of our 
wildlife areas where the majority of tourists go are in my judgment 
reasonably safe and there should be no need for tourists to fear 
going there 
the 83yearold adamson was shot to death near his camp at the 
remote kora national reserve in eastern kenya while trying to help 
an assistant and a guest who were being robbed by three gunmen 
adamson a retired game warden had lived in kenya since 1924 
and with his wife joy helped to popularize conservation through 
their practice of releasing captive lions into the wild joy who 
was killed by a servant in 1980 detailed the unique practice in the 
books born free living free and forever free which 
subsequently were made into movies 
in july a french husband and wife were killed in the meru game 
park east of mount kenya when they stumbled onto a group of 
poachers while driving down a seldomused track 
little more than two weeks later on july 27 nine men attacked a 
19member tour group organized by the connecticut audubon society on 
a 40mile stretch of dirt road between the southern national parks 
of tsavo and amboseli killing marie esther ferraro of bethany conn 
seven tourists have been wounded in separate attacks since 
september a year ago tour operators say several hundred tourists 
mostly americans have been frightened off by the violence 
although the cancellations were quickly replaced by new bookings 
the tour operators expressed fears adamsons death would prompt 
other tourists to cancel or defer plans to visit kenya 
they call and want to know if its safe to come to kenya 
said the manager of one large safari company who spoke on condition 
he not be identified by name we try to reassure them 
another safari group said it received 50 cancellations in the 
four days after adamson died 
tourism is of prime concern to the government 
last year a record 660000 tourists visited kenyas game parks 
and indian ocean beach resorts and brought in an estimated 350 
million outstripping income from the main export coffee 
the tour operators expressed their anxieties recently at a 
meeting with leakey who sought to allay their fears 
he said roads allowed to fall into disrepair in recent years 
were being regraded and resurfaced to provide quicker and therefore 
safer journeys plainclothes security officers have been posted in 
most of the major tourist lodges in kenyas game parks he said 
in an interview later leakey claimed that because of the 
intensified antipoaching operation kenyas tourist attractions 
actually are safer now than six months ago most of the attacks he 
said had occurred outside the national parks 
using more than 300 new weapons and 45 new vehicles along with 
increased air surveillance and renewed foot patrols kenya has 
brought poaching virtually to a halt since leakeys appointment in 
april 
the number of elephants killed has dropped from an average three 
a day to three since june he said in the last decade the 
slaughter by poachers reduced kenyas elephant population from 
65000 to 17000 
about three dozen poachers have been killed in the combined 
effort by the department of wildlife police and paramilitary units 
said leakey in the last few months no game rangers have died at 
poachers hands 
the revitalized effort has brought poachers under new pressures 
leakey said 
previously people werent being hurt because they didnt 
feature high on poachers lists because elephants were so easy to 
get he said 
now he added they dont know where to go they have nothing 
theyre short of cash and theyve turned to robbery 
leakey said the government believed it was dealing with fewer 
than 100 of the armed bandits whom he identified as indigent 
somalis called shifta who have fled their wartorn impoverished 
country to exploit kenyas elephants for their ivory tusks ivory 
fetches 110 to 155 a pound on the world market a record price 
until very recently there was very easy money to be made in 
the national parks by killing elephants leakey said nobody was 
after them there was no danger its very risky now to go into 
tsavo if youre a poacher 
although shifta have robbed and harrassed citizens in eastern 
kenya since the early 1960s david stiles an anthropologist who has 
studied shiftas for nearly two decades said many of those 
perpetrating the violence were deserters from somalias army which 
is fighting a rebellion in northern somalia 
leakey said the shifta were spread along a swath of arid remote 
territory from tsavos periphery up to meru and posed little threat 
to those who stayed on main roads and tourist byways

playing a teenage son who has the condition 
and cbs has the famous teddy z a sophisticated insideshow

nbc had little room for improvement having already pummeled abc 
and cbs for four seasons but in its effort to seek the perfect 
primetime schedule it has deigned to do some minor tinkering 
adding five new shows abc and cbs added nine and eight 
respectively 
theres nbcs sister kate starring stephanie beacham former 
glamour girl on dynasty who is surprisingly wellcast as a 
crotchety nun with a passel of precious urchins 
nutt house is mindless slapstick about an illrun new york 
hotel starring harvey korman and cloris leachman it comes from mel 
brooks who teamed with wunderkind alan spencer creator of sledge 
hammer it is paired with night court which looks like 
educational television by comparison 
what would society do without a network hour devoted to the 
emotional involvements of scantily clad lifeguards nbc has met the 
challenge with baywatch sadly the only show on this season from 
mr quality television grant tinkers company 
do you miss miami vice nbc replaces it with another 
buddycops show this time its old copyoung cop and called 
hardball not as much style as vice but good character 
possibilities 
thirdplace cbs which has the greatest need for breakout shows 
has settled instead for a bottomofthebarrel ratings ploy 
rescue 911 a graphic realitybased show about emergency 
calls it is a throwback to the early days of last season when the 
writers strike crippled production of fiction shows and the networks 
had to stoop to stuff like this this season cbs is putting it on 
by choice 
cbs island son lured perennial miniseries star richard 
chamberlain back to series television with a hawaii locale and a 
role as a doctor it wasnt available for preseason scrutiny 
the people next door a sitcom about a cartoonist and his 
family relies on special effects and apparently hopes to capitalize 
on the success of who framed roger rabbit its an ambitious 
attempt but doesnt work 
wolf stars jack scalia in another version of the discredited 
cop who becomes a private eye and tries to clear his name theres 
nothing to help viewers pick this one out of a lineup 
cbs peaceable kingdom stars the durable lindsay wagner as a 
remarkably boring zoo administrator the cheetah is a better actor 
stephen cannell wiseguy hunter has a third network 
show top of the hill starring william katt greatest 
american hero as a longhaired surfer who takes over his ailing 
fathers congressional seat civics 101 was more riveting 
snoops is a screwball mysterycomedy starring tim and daphne 
maxwell reid former stars of franks place he is a professor 
of criminology she is a protocol officer nothing was available for 
prescreening but these are likable stars 
abcs ballyhooed deal with bochco has yielded the questionable 
but competent doogie howser starring neil patrick harris as the 
16yearold genius with a medical license 
cbs made a little headway with the western paradise last 
season abc perhaps inspired more by the success of cbs lonesome 
dove adds another of the longmissing western genre the young 
riders about the pony express it needs better writing 
abc has two innocuous spinoffs from whos the boss comes 
living dolls a sitcom about four teenaged models sharing an 
apartment in new york michael learned stars as their den mother 
the other is family matters a black family sitcom centered on 
the extended family of acerbic elevator operator harriette of 
perfect strangers 
a writerproducer spun off abcs head of the class to create 
a black welcome back kotter in the new homeroom 
in abcs free spirit a housekeeper whos a witch goes to work 
for a single father what comic possibilities 
to recap cbs has two good bets in major dad and teddy z 
both joining the reasonably successful monday comedy lineup but 
theyll likely be moved to other nights 
abcs life goes on deserves a break and might get one its 
in a time period opposite the top10 60 minutes and isnt 
expected to do boffo numbers so it might stay around a while 
critical response should help it 
abcs chicken soup is an acquired taste but it has a cushy 
time slot behind roseanne hey a lot of people think jackie 
mason is very funny 
likely goners due to low quality andor tough competition 
include homeroom peaceable kingdom wolf and free 
spirit 
nutt house could get a cult following of overmedicated 
viewers but dont bet on it 
the rest of the pack merit little more than a shrug 
so there you have one of the reasons that almost twothirds of 
homes with televisions also have cable and why a third of viewers 
opted for something other than network programs last season 
this season those people will pay their cable bills happily

networks are beginning the new tv season with 
a new fact of life increasing sponsor scrutiny of the shows on 
which their ads appear 
the heads of the networks insist there will be no censorship by 
advertisers or pressure groups but they also say theyre looking 
more closely at shows of questionable taste the question is whose 
taste will prevail 
nbc entertainment president brandon tartikoff whose network 
vowed to air the critically acclaimed but controversial tv movie 
about abortion roe vs wade without sponsorship if it came to 
that said he was concerned about a possible trend toward 
programmingbyboycott last season 
what you become concerned about is sort of a new mccarthyism 
he said what i was fearful of is today the sex tapes tomorrow 
dear john 
last season sponsors balked at socalled trash tv fare but 
also at roe vs wade because of the subject and the critically 
praised miniseries lonesome dove because of its authentically 
raunchy western dialogue 
but the network bosses said advertisers from whom the networks 
draw their revenues have the right to withhold sponsorship of shows 
to which they object and in fact have always shied away from certain 
programs 
we get advertiser pullout all the time said cbs 
entertainment president kim lemasters that is a normal landscape 
for network television some advertisers he said will not 
advertise in any show that has water in it or it has certain cars 
in it that are offensive to them 
advertiser boycotts dont become tantamount to censorship 
lemasters said unless the network bows to the pressure of 
controversial shows he said i plan to continue to broadcast 
them that is our ultimate statement 
cbs broadcast group president howard stringer sees advertiser 
sensitivity as part of a larger viewer revolt against sexually 
explicit or violent fare 
the message to the creative community is again that taste 
albeit difficult to define still revolves around quality and that 
the audience is smarter at that then you tend to think he said 
we can defend ourselves when we put something on the air thats 
really worth defending and some of the sitcoms in which sex is a 
onetrack theme alienate the viewers 
nbc president and chief executive officer robert c wright a 
former ge executive said advertisers are simply responding to 
consumer desires and dont have any sinister intent to censor whats 
on the airwaves 
they scare off real easy when it comes to having their 
companys name associated with something even though it might not 
have any real impact what i have been trying to do is get them to 
focus in on that and say listen investigate the real facts try to 
make a more informed opinion 
the networks believe that allowing advertisers to prescreen 
shows will help educate them but at a meeting of television critics 
this summer concern was voiced that prescreening would be an even 
bigger step toward censorship 
no say the network executives advertisers will see completed 
shows and those will go on the air regardless of their reaction 
they hope prescreening will let advertisers make an informed 
decision and counteract any biased information from specialinterest 
groups 
overall i think they advertisers have pretty strong feelings 
on their own and they dont need any help from the outside said 
abc president john sias when they do make a decision obviously 
its in the interest of third parties who want this to make it 
appear that that pressure has been primarily responsible for it 
at the critics meeting terry rakolta the michigan housewife who 
organized a boycott of the hilarious but admittedly often tasteless 
fox comedy married with children had backed off some of her 
earlier criticisms and now advocates policing the airwaves only 
during family viewing hours 
what were saying is selfregulate she said you know the 
boundaries were not in the linedrawing business you draw the 
line 
the networks apparently plan to do that 
tartikoff told the critics i do think there were some 
instances as im sure having read a lot of your individual 
columns you felt too that there was some linecrossing and some 
shows that were illadvised to have been broadcast in the form that 
they were and weve recognized that 
stringer said the bottom line is as always viewer discretion 
i have a sort of vague feeling that censorship like charity 
should begin at home but unlike charity should stay there

its really easy it really is just turn the 
channel press the remote a few times there see its pbs it 
wont hurt you 
its almost like real tv listed there in the television guide 
along with all the garbage on commercial tv sure there are a few 
good network shows and theres some decent stuff on cable but youve 
rented all the worthwhile videos and after a steady diet of 
rambo and charles in charge you feel kind of grimy vaguely 
out of sorts its time for a dose of pbs 
think of it as oat bran for the mind 
agreed there may not be the bbc blockbusters of seasons past 
and how many of us really need to know how to restore an 
18thcentury farmhouse but there will be some incredible gems like 
bill moyers interviews with the late mythologist and storyteller 
joseph campbell or a brilliant work of fiction such as a very 
british coup 
here are some programs to choose from circle in the tv guide 
and watch every remote control can be trained to find the pbs 
channel 
moyers has a new series this season on contemporary poetry 
promising to make an esoteric subject more accessible to average 
viewers think how impressed the folks around the water cooler will 
be 
when some bozo is talking about rescue 911 you can wax 
erudite talking about travels a 12parter following sojourners 
on unusual treks such as an american comedians tour of the soviet 
union and a motorcyclists trip across china 
if art of the western world sounds like a college course it 
is the series filmed on location in 10 countries examines the 
development of western art from classical greek and roman works to 
20thcentury masters it is being offered as a collegelevel course 
by the pbs adult learning service you didnt pay attention to this 
stuff in school and wish you had heres a second chance 
americas century is a sixpart examination of american 
foreign policy in the 20th century great stuff for wowing the 
cocktail party crowd 
so is moyers other series the public mind a fourpart 
discussion of how news politics advertising and business are 
evolving to meet the demands of an increasingly imageobsessed 
culture its ironic youre only watching to impress someone 
remember all those great old network documentaries they were 
like pieces on 60 minutes except longer those are on pbs now 
this season theyre on the palestinian uprising aids and the high 
cost of growing old the latter a special anchored by walter 
cronkite 
other documentaries focus on people from c everett koop to 
harold lloyd 
the american experience is back its an anthology of 
documentaries about various chapters in american history also back 
is trying times like a sitcom only funnier and smarter 
and look at this seasons stars geena davis peter riegert 
carrie fisher judge reinhold and stockard channing 
the venerable great performances will present new productions 
of showboat and our town 
masterpiece theatre offers what promises to be a great 
miniseries of a tale of two cities the one you bought the 
classic comic to instead of reading the assignment now you realize 
it was a great book heres a chance to see the motion picture 
two ongoing series have new hosts you need to know this in case 
you talk to a longtime pbs viewer diana rigg takes over from 
vincent price on mystery and stephen thomas takes over from bob 
vilas on this old house thats the home repair and restoration 
show that inexplicably fascinates you on lazy saturday afternoons 
to welcome the newcomers pbs even has a new logo an animated 
crystalized version of that everyman face in the pbs p 
so there it is you might not want to watch everything but 
theres bound to be something there for every viewer 
abc has a comedy about a witch for petes sake youre going to 
have to find something to watch right might as well be pbs 
go on its like jumping into the water theres that initial 
shock but then you get used to it pay yourself a dollar for every 
hour you watch or pay pbs you might find youll want to

the best new comedy of the season is cbs 
the famous teddy z a fortuitous pairing of producer hugh wilson 
franks place and teenfilm star jon cryer pretty in

unlimited talent agency who is suddenly thrust into the thick of

the actor impressing the guy so much he makes teddy his agent 
injokes abound and viewers will delight at being in on them 
like wilsons other comedies he also did wkrp in 
cincinnati the supporting characters are as well drawn as the 
lead

going around quoting al floss alex rocco wilsons quintessential 
bigtime agent floss to secretary what are you a statue screen 
the people who come in here 
teddy z is wellplaced on monday between murphy brown and 
designing women

the weak link in cbs monday comedy lineup is 
the new the people next door a rare example of too much of a 
mediocre thing 
this specialeffects sitcom is about a cartoonist named walter 
kellogg jeffrey jones whose imagination becomes reality producing 
visions of talking moose buzzing airplanes and giant green monsters 
other people can see too 
theres also a complex sitcom family who are as unfunny as 
walters creations are weird 
walter is about to wed abigail mary gross and has moved into 
her smalltown home where she lives with her crotchety sister 
christina pickles their mothers ashes and abigails psychiatry 
practice 
theres more walter has two children a teenage son and a 
daughter whose alleged overbite supplies most of the attempted 
laugh lines in the pilot 
there are some cute moments in people next door steve allen 
does a cameo as one of walters imaginings arriving with grand 
piano to croon imagination is funny and geraldo rivera pops up 
on a tv screen intoning a promo for a show on men with overactive 
imaginations and the women who love them walter then envisions 
the set exploding 
the gimmickry cant long carry an unfunny sitcom hey didnt 
somebody say the same thing when alf premiered nevertheless

abcs life goes on is the best family 
drama since thirtysomething though its style is of the more 
traditional family 
the title comes from the beatles song obladi oblada and 
is the reigning philosophy of the thachers a middleclass family 
struggling to make ends meet 
the show is getting a lot of attention because one of its cast 
members is christopher burke an actor with downs syndrome who 
plays teenage son corky 
much of the pilot plot revolves around corkys challenge to 
mainstream with kids at a regular school including his younger 
sister 
patti lupone evita is a surprise as tv mom libby thacher 
but she is well cast as is bill smitrovich crime story who 
plays her husband drew 
kellie martin plays becca a perpetually embarrassed 
eighthgrader apalled at having to attend junior high school with 
her brother monique lanier plays paige drews daughter from a 
previous marriage she has broken up with her boyfriend and been 
forced to move back home 
the pilot is funny and poignant nicely written by executive 
producer michael braverman in the pilot drew is trying to come up 
with the money to buy into a construction company it would help a 
lot if he could depend on the extra 5000 a year the family will 
save on corkys tuition if corky can make it in a regular public 
junior high school 
meanwhile libby is facing her 40th birthday and paige is trying 
to figure what shes doing with her life while becca learns that 
corky might not be such a bad addition to the social whirl at school 
when he immediately befriends the football star 
life goes on goes into a tough sunday time period opposite 
cbs 60 minutes still that means abc isnt expecting its 
ratings to go through the roof so it might get to stay around for a 
while and it will get a head start when the pilot is aired a second 
time after the hit roseanne 
this is a nice show with a lot of heart that deserves to go on 
and on

theres nothing wrong with cbs new crime 
drama wolf but theres nothing particularly right about it 
either 
its rockford files without the humor wiseguy without 
the offbeatness miami vice without the style 
jack scalia plays an italianamerican former cop who was busted 
from the force after he was framed he reunites with his oldcountry 
father sal joseph sirola and buys a fishing boat a chance to 
work as a private eye gives him the opportunity to clear his name 
the pilot is competent but theres no compelling reason to watch 
wolf except for the san francisco setting 
the series probably wont be around long it has drawn a tuesday 
time period opposite nbcs in the heat of the night and abcs 
hit roseanne 
expect wolf to whimper off soon into the nielsen woods

with miami vice and simon amp simon 
gone were in desperate need of a new buddycops show 
nbc to the rescue with hardball replacing miami vice on 
friday 
so what if this is a worn old premise it works when its done 
right and its done right in hardball this time we have the 
engaging pairing of balding tough guy charlie battles john ashton 
with joe kaz kaczierowski richard tyson a hunk with long hair 
and a harley 
we know the drill these two misfits are partners battles 
doesnt like anything about kaz his hair his name his attitude 
kaz is merely amused of course when the chips are down kaz will 
prove his worth and eventually he and charlie will form a grudging 
friendship 
producer frank lupo is a former partner of stephen j cannell in 
hunter for nbc 
hardball joins an allnew lineup on friday night the only 
night of the week where no 1 nbc still has problems and has been 
rotating series trying to find something that will stick

los angeles a the pilot for top of the hill has been 
kicking around so long one of the actors has died and another is in 
another networks sitcom 
finally cbs bought it from stephen j cannell wiseguy 
hunter 
top of the hill its name wisely changed from lame duck 
tests credibility by creating a hero who is a crusading congressman 
but we are being cynical even in this age of capitol hill scandals 
of the week there are some heroes in washington cannells tom bell 
is inspired by an older example rep leo ryan of california who 
was killed while investigating the jonestown cult 
william katt greatest american hero plays bell a 
36yearold surfer elected to fill out the term of his ailing 
father thomas pat bell sr dick oneill 
at the hands of a veteran house leader played in the pilot by 
the late kenneth macmillan bell learns he has to play ball to get 
anything done for his constituency corinne bohrer who is playing a 
witch in the new abc sitcom free spirit was the love interest 
much of the pilot is taken up with explaining how congress works 
until that becomes tedious and bell segues into a clone of sonny 
crockett and heads for a fictional latin american country to do 
battle with drug lords hes a little slow at this at first he 
tells them he has diplomatic immunity 
bell takes on this mission to search for the missing son of a 
constituent who had been scouring washington for help 
top of the hill goes into a forgetit time period on thursday 
opposite nbcs comedies so dont expect congressman bell to get

anthony jf oreilly is bestknown in 
international business circles as chairman and chief executive of 
hj heinz co the food giant famous for ketchup baked beans and 
pickles 
but in his native land hes tony oreilly eminent irishman 
im very comfortable with my irishness and very proud of it 
says oreilly 53 multimillionaire philanthropist rugby hero 
lawyer agriculturalist publisher campaigner for peace in northern 
ireland and symbol of irelands transformation from rural backwater 
to modern industrial society 
i see myself as a manager in the world of heinz he says i 
see myself in ireland as an innovator a creator a pacifier 
having worked in the united states for 18 years he is considered 
one of irelands most successful expatriates 
oreilly is not universally adored in ireland perhaps partly 
because of what the financial times calls oldfashioned irish 
begrudgery exacerbated by oreillys flashy life 
small countries dont like tall poppies oreilly says i 
think ive hardened against that 
he spoke during an interview in the drawing room of castlemartin 
his 28room georgian manor it overlooks the meandering river liffey 
and paddocks where his white charolais cattle and bay and brown 
racehorses graze 
the 500acre estate lies 30 miles south of dublin in county 
kildare and is green of course 
this is the center says oreilly who also owns houses in 
western cork and near heinzs pittsburgh headquarters it clearly 
is my spiritual home the rhythm of life i get from ireland 
oreilly retains his irish citizenship and accent and 
occasionally speaks irish to confuse the enemy he usually 
spends a weekend a month in ireland typically continuing on to 
europe or africa on heinz business he vacations in ireland and 
says he intends to return here to live out his life 
wherever he is oreilly calls the managers of his irish 
investments daily 
he is 6feet2 and struggles with his weight silverhaired and 
ruddy he is a dapper dresser who likes to splash on the cologne 
he is hospitable and likes to joke after meeting robert mugabe 
the marxist leader of zimbabwe oreilly told him were both 
students of marx you of karl and me of groucho 
like any good irishman he constantly refers to the islands 
great writers and believes luck has contributed to his success 
the thing i dislike most about ireland is the absolute tyranny 
with which history is imposed today this reaching back to history 
as a guide to the future its a straitjacket he said 
he was referring to the irish republican armys guerrilla war to 
rid northern ireland of british rule and unite the province with the 
republic 
we are not for that said oreilly a roman catholic who 
believes in the nonviolent unification of ireland i consider the 
terrorist divide to be one of the great stains on irish history 
i do believe that the unification of ireland is not worth 
shedding one drop of blood 
in 1976 oreilly founded the ireland fund a charity that has 
raised millions of dollars in united states for solving social 
problems caused by the fighting in northern ireland similar funds 
operate in canada australia and britain he chairs them all 
oreilly denies persistent speculation that his goal is a 
political career and has rejected an offer to serve as irelands 
agriculture minister 
still he has strong opinions on irish issues he says irelands 
high taxes should be cut and divorce and abortion legalized 
he also says a successful international businessman is an 
enormously important political role model for the irish people 
oreilly is irelands biggest newspaper owner as chairman and 
main shareholder of independent newspapers plc with titles that 
include the irish independent and tabloid sunday world 
he also is chairman of fitzwilton plc a holding company with 
interests that range from a retail chain to a sign maker oreillys 
other irish business ventures include oil prospecter atlantic 
resources plc several hotels and a license to practice law 
his personal fortune exceeds 100 million he says 
oreilly says he told heinz before taking the 4 millionayear 
job that he would not abandon his irish pursuits 
it was all up front oreilly said theres never been a 
conflict of interest 
oreilly was born in dublin in 1936 the only child of the chief 
customs inspector 
at age 6 oreilly attended belvedere college an exclusive 
jesuit school where writer james joyce was educated 
within eight months of leaving school at age 18 he had become 
one of irelands greatest rugby players his career spanned the 
50s 60s and 70s he played 29 internationals for ireland and in 
1955 set a record for touchdowns scored on tours which remains 
unbroken 
enlarged photographs of oreilly the rugby player adorn the walls 
of his house he talks about the game constantly using it as an 
analogy for business and life 
it taught me a fervent and neverending respect for 
collegiality we shared the rewards we shared the losses 
he excelled academically as well he attended university college 
dublin where he studied law and then the university of bradford 
in england for a phd in agriculture 
oreilly became head of the irish dairy board and soon displayed 
his marketing abilities by inventing kerrygold the internationally 
known irish butter brand name 
he then managed irish food companies doing business with heinz 
the foodmakers executives were impressed with the young oreilly 
and in 1969 they offered him the job of managing director of 
heinzs british operations 
within four years he was president of the entire company and in 
1987 when henry j heinz ii died oreilly succeeded him as the 
first nonfamily chairman in the companys 119year history 
oreilly has energized the 6 billion concern by cutting costs 
tying pay more closely to performance promoting stock ownership 
among employees and expanding into the fastergrowing baby pet and 
diet food industries 
oreillys rugbyteam spirit apparently makes him wellliked 
among heinzs 40000 employees and his profitmaking talents are 
popular with shareholders 
he loves a party and entertains celebrity friends lavishly often 
with his own singing and pianoplaying he travels on heinzs 
corporate jet and in cigarequipped luxury cars 
oreilly married australianborn susan cameron a former concert 
pianist in 1962 and they have six children including triplets 
aside from irishness what makes oreilly tick 
with the philosophy of gee thanks what have you done for me 
today i feel myself in a sense of permanent competition with the 
world outside he says 
but he says there is the constant inherent contradiction of 
success and the enjoyment of success 
here i am in this lovely celtic setting which i see eight weeks 
out of the year and never leave without regret and a backward 
glance

from exercise bars then get down to a roughandtumble soccer match 
attrape le bal attrape le bal catch the ball screamed his 
excellency ellomkodjo schuppius of togo as the ball zoomed to the 
edge of the field 
this time the diplomats were playing against some african 
students who generally turn up at the field saturday mornings other 
times they just kick the ball around among themselves 
all week long the diplomats sit behind their desks hold meetings 
and attend receptions the weekly workout is a chance to sweat the 
whiskey and good food out of their systems and keep in shape they 
said 
but when they discard their formal attire they are still mindful 
of their position one is wearing a dior sweat suit another sports 
a gucci 
we believe in a sound mind in a sound body said pauldesire 
kabore the ambassador of burkina faso who acts as dean of the 
informal ambassadorial club the club unites 12 frenchspeaking 
african countries some of the poorest in the world who pool their 
time and resources to attract us investment and organize projects 
to benefit their homelands 
the others are benin ivory coast congo central african 
republic mali senegal rwanda and guinea 
the 12 ambassadors are traveling to denver next month to take 
part in a trade and investment fair and they hope to get a game 
together there possibly with some of the american participants 
kabore said 
ambassadors who are too out of shape to play soccer or jog 
sometimes come out on saturday mornings to watch or walk laps around 
the field 
ambassador moumouni adamou djermakoye of niger is an active 
participant in fact he might be called an overachiever in 
addition to the weekly match and jogging he rides his bicycle 13 
miles every sunday and plays basketball 
he has already held the posts of foreign affairs minister 
minister of health youth and sports and served as a regional 
governor he came to washington a year ago 
togos schuppius who has been here six years also plays tennis 
on the weekends and walks everywhere he can it helps me get in 
shape mentally and physically for the week he said 
many ambassadors in washington have swimming pools and tennis 
courts at their residences not so most of the africans whose 
budgets are limited 
chads mahammat ali adoun said he wouldnt know what to do with a 
pool anyway i cant swim my country is very dry he said 
nonetheless he appears in good shape tall and wellmuscled i 
jog several rounds then i hang on the bars have to exercise those 
pectorals and abdominals he said at home its too hot to 
exercise like this 
at home soccer is a national pastime 
the african students do not appear intimidated by their 
distinguished opponents the soccer game is for fun no score is 
kept of winners or losers our health is the winner said kabore

a lot of people say rural america with its 
wideopen spaces and small towns is in trouble and needs a lift 
the senate says a modest infusion of federal funds around 15 
billion over five years is a good place to start the house is 
still working on its rural development plan the bush administration 
hasnt given details of what it supports but there are hints 
establishing a rural development policy requires striking a 
balance between longterm strategies to improve rural economies and 
shorter term efforts to provide jobs and the infrastructure needed 
for longterm development and improved quality of life says 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
however he adds national debt as the predominant constraint 
on federal spending puts a lid on how much the government can spend 
on domestic programs including rural development 
but even if funding were available it is not clear that simply 
adding programs or funding would be helpful in solving rural 
economic problems yeutter says 
rural development for decades has been a goal of every 
administration and most officeseekers and farm organizations pet 
programs have been promoted from time to time but the national 
commitment has been varied and often fuzzy 
an agriculture department task force earlier this year reported 
to yeutter on how to improve usdas rural development efforts 
yeutters comments about striking a balance and federal spending 
were included in the report 
the rural economy has difficulty keeping pace with national 
economic growth it said there are fundamental problems of being 
a rural community small size isolation an unskilled work force 
and a lack of institutional support 
cyclical recovery alone will not solve rural americas 
problems the task force said without structural adjustments to 
enhance its productive potential the rural economy will continue to 
lag and many more rural residents will be forced to leave their 
hometowns 
the task force made a number of recommendations within current 
budgetary resources and without major organizational restructuring 
to improve the effectiveness of usda rural programs 
usda should begin by committing itself to rural development as 
a major departmental mission the task force said usda should 
articulate a clear goal for rural development and base its policy 
decisions on this goal it can also take steps to strengthen its 
capacity for effective and concerted program action 
meanwhile sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate 
agriculture committee and a longtime supporter of rural 
development saw the senate give unanimous approval a month ago to 
his rural partnerships act of 1989 
rural america today is in trouble leahy said compared to 
the nation as a whole rural unemployment and poverty are higher and 
economic opportunities are deteriorating we cannot have two 
americas one a land of opportunity and a second rural america 
left behind 
leahy said his bill is aimed at helping rural people an 
estimated 61 million americans including farmers businessmen and 
workers in 14000 small towns and cities across every state 
while agriculture is important only 10 percent of rural 
americans live and work on farms leahy said the problems of farmers 
will be addressed specifically in the 1990 farm bill and other 
initiatives 
the rural partnerships act would provide federal dollars to be 
matched locally to create jobs and economic opportunity through 
local revolving funds 
through other programs money would be used to help improve 
education and health care safe drinking water and waste disposal 
would be other objectives sought by the senate bill 
rep glenn english dokla chairman of the house subcommittee 
on conservation credit and rural development held field hearings 
this summer and says legislation deserves a high priority 
english warns however that significant new spending in rural 
communities will be impossible given the budget crunch 
but he says that if programs are targeted modernized and used to 
complement each other rural communities can be given a real 
opportunity to prosper 
there is some feeling in the house that rural development should 
be dealt with in legislation to replace the 1985 farm law contrary 
to leahys plan for keeping the two separate 
regardless of the maneuvering there is growing evidence that 
rural development as an issue is around to stay 
an environmental group renew america said last week that 
thousands of miles of streams are polluted pesticides continue to 
seep into groundwater acid rain is changing the face of the 
forests lakes and farmland and litter is scattered over the 
countryside 
in a report about communities at risk the group said rural 
america is changing and not for the better 
wes jackson of the land institute salina kan a nonprofit 
research organization said in the reports introduction that the 
countryside represents the vulnerable soft underbelly of us 
society at large 
the simple reality is that rural people are a dispersed 
minority with no political clout marginal isolates rapidly becoming 
like third world peoples he said and increasingly the 
landscapes on which they live take on a third world appearance

an italian bank said that its branch in atlanta ga 
had been involved in a major financial scandal regarding letters of 
credit for exports to iraq 
claudio cremona a spokesman for banca nazionale del lavoro 
italys largest stateowned bank said tuesday that bank inspectors 
had uncovered as many as 2500 transactions done by its atlanta 
branch which hadnt been authorized by either the banks north 
american management or by the head office in rome 
the unauthorized practices which were confined to the atlanta 
branch took place during the 12 months before the operation was 
discovered in early august the spokesman said 
he said the bank had yet to determine the exact amount of money 
involved in the scam because the auditing is still going on 
the investigation was made more difficult by the sophisticated 
methods used to keep the transactions off the official books he 
said 
cremona said the letters of credit while correct technically 
exceeded the credit ceiling that banca nazionale set for the branch 
he couldnt say by how much the branch had surpassed its credit

japanese and west german companies that 
ordinarily advertise in weekly news magazines apparently dont want 
their products associated with memories of blitzkriegs gas chambers 
and death marches 
time magazine and us news amp world report said tuesday that some 
advertisers pulled ads out of their special issues on the 50th 
anniversary of the outbreak of world war ii 
time and us news declined to identify the advertisers but the 
world war ii issues were noticeably lacking in ads from japanese 
companies which are heavy advertisers in the magazines 
newsweek magazine whose special world war ii coverage was 
limited to slightly more than two pages of book reviews in its sept 
4 issue had a normal amount of advertising from japanese companies 
in the issue 
west german companies do not advertise every week in any of the 
three newsweeklies so it is difficult to determine whether any had 
pulled ads because of the cover stories in time and us news 
some of the ads that were pulled were switched to other issues of 
the magazines said spokesmen for the magazines 
the net of it was that we did lose some business time 
spokesman brian brown said 
spokesmen for japans toyota motor corp nissan motor co ltds 
infiniti division and honda motor co ltds acura division which 
frequently advertise in the magazines said tuesday that their 
absence from the world war ii editions had nothing to do with the 
magazines contents 
newsweeklies often notify advertisers when they plan articles 
that might embarrass them for example if a magazine is running a 
cover story on alcoholism it would warn liquor companies 
we make it very clear that the story is going to run in any 
case and i think that speaks well for editorial integrity brown 
said 
us news has a similar policy spokeswoman beth kseniak said 
us news has no ads from japanese or west german companies in 
its aug 28sept 4 double issue featuring stories on world war ii 
times aug 28 issue on world war ii carries a single japanese ad a 
twopage spread from japans pioneer electronics usa inc 
japanese and west german advertisers are entirely absent from 
times sept 4 issue which has 17 pages about world war ii and a 
small headline or flag about the special section at the top of 
the cover 
newsweeks aug 28 issue has 10 pages of advertising from 
japanese companies and some small ads from west german companies 
which are in an advertising supplement by the nation of nigeria its 
sept 4 issue which contains the world war ii book reviews has 10 
pages of japanese advertising 
volkswagen usa ran a onepage ad in the aug 21 issue of time but 
the german company did not have anything scheduled for the aug 28 
issues of time or us news regardless of the contents of those 
issues said marketing director william gelgota 
nissans infiniti division which is gearing up for the launch of 
its new luxury car ran no ads in time and us news but had a

federal regulators as promised following the 
indictment of 46 futures brokers and traders have come up with a 
package of reforms and now want to hear what the industry thinks 
the commodity futures trading commission which oversees the 
futures industry voted unanimously tuesday to submit the proposed 
rules changes for public comment 
the reform package which includes increased surveillance on 
commodities exchange floors at the start and end of trading days 
was proposed after 46 brokers and traders in chicagos futures 
exchanges were indicted aug 2 on fraud and racketeering charges 
those charges stemming from a lengthy undercover federal probe 
of the chicago mercantile exchange and the chicago board of trade 
included allegations that traders cheated their customers through 
falsified records and prearranged trades 
we support their efforts to address these issues said andrew 
a yemma a spokesman for the chicago mercantile exchange after a 
thorough review process earlier this year our own board of 
governors approved a comprehensive set of rule enhancements that are 
very similar to what the cftc proposed today 
bot president and chief executive officer tom donovan said in a 
statement we have not yet reviewed the cftcs new and proposed 
rules however it appears that many of the recommendations are 
either already in place at the chicago board of trade or will soon 
be implemented 
the markets themselves have proposed tighter trading rules and 
updated surveillance and auditing techniques to combat abuse 
yemma noted that both exchanges announced plans to develop an 
electronic surveillance system that will use handheld computer 
terminals in the trading pits 
he said the exchanges hope to have the new system developed 
within a year and with the adoption of these measures we are 
confident that opportunities for the types of abuses raised in the 
indictments will be effectively eliminated 
critics have claimed the traditional open outcry system of 
trading in which participants use shouts and hand signals to make 
transactions in crowded hectic trading pits makes it difficult to 
track and detect fraud 
the commission is committed to take all necessary steps to 
protect the public confidence in these markets said cftc 
chairwoman wendy gramm the action we are taking today will 
reinforce our regulatory system 
the chicago charges alleged that traders cheated customers by 
falsifying trading cards which record purchase and sales 
information or altering the time that trades were made to take 
advantage of price shifts in the market 
some brokers allegedly conspired with exchange members who trade 
only for their own accounts known as locals to finalize trades 
after the close of the market in order to illegally try to set a 
more advantageous price 
in addition to tightening surveillance on the nations commodity 
exchange floors the package calls for 
easily identifiable trading cards with preprinted information 
that would allow regulators to reconstruct the sequence of a trade 
an investigative practice known as following the audit trail 
frequent collection at least every 30 minutes and eventually 
every 15 minutes of trading cards to reduce the potential for 
altering records to conceal illegal trading activity 
preventing people with histories of rules violations from 
serving on the governing boards disciplinary committees or 
arbitration panels of exchanges or registered futures associations 
all of these changes will help detect but also deter illegal 
trading said mrs gramm after the commission vote 
the cftcs proposed changes are subject to comment by interested 
parties for the next 30 to 60 days before the commission can make 
its approval final 
one element put into effect immediately was the creation of a 
pilot surveillance program the floor surveillance task force will 
have responsibility for direct examination of trading cards and 
other trading records on the exchange floor 
the pilot program is designed to enable the commission to 
determine its needs for a permanent floor surveillance program in 
the near future

some major drug companies in effect said i 
told you so at the latest news of a troubled generic drug maker 
but added that it was too early to tell the scope of problems among 
their brand x rivals 
you might expect that problems would eventuate said 
warnerlambert co spokesman peter wolf in morris plains generic 
drug companies dont have quite the same understanding of the 
longterm commitment to research integrity he said tuesday 
hoffmannla roche inc is concerned about the recent findings 
because they question the reliability of some generic drugs said 
paul oestreicher spokesman for the nutleybased company its a 
serious issue 
the food and drug administration moved monday to withdraw from 
the market a popular generic highblood pressure medicine made by 
bolar pharmaceutical co inc it was the third such action aimed at 
a generic company in a week shaking the 5billionayear industry 
the fda is investigating 11 drug makers following allegations of 
fraud and corruption involving employees of the agencys generic 
drug section and some generic drug companies 
generic drugs duplicate brandname products whose patents have 
expired and can cost up to 70 percent less 
some major drug makers also produce generic medicines often 
versions of their own drugs whose patents expired 
other researchoriented pharmaceutical companies contacted 
tuesday stayed out of the fray 
were not in the generic business and were going to pass on 
this one said ronald asinari spokesman for scheringplough corp 
of madison 
nor would merck amp co spokeswoman cindy zarsky comment though 
she did point out that the rahwaybased companys research and 
development budget for 1989 was 750 million 
our response to generic competition is we will continue to 
discover and develop innovative medicines she said 
many of the companies said it was too early too tell how 
widespread problems were among the generics or whether the 
brandname companies would be affected 
i think were all waiting holding our breath hoping that it 
isnt more widespread because ultimately in the public perception 
it affects the whole industry wolf said 
analysts doubted the problems at generic drug makers would change 
their big brothers strategy about entering or leaving the generic 
market or make a difference to their bottom line 
analysts noted that the major profits in the researchdriven drug 
business come from patented drugs

the national labor relations board has ordered 
its regional offices to provide new training to employees who handle 
inquiries about workers rights a move stemming from a study by an 
antiunion group that said the nlrb often provided inaccurate 
information 
please schedule additional training for all staff professionals 
who serve as information officers and ensure that only those who 
possess a sufficient level of experience are assigned to serve as 
information officers william g stack the nlrbs acting 
associate general counsel said in a memo sent earlier this month to 
the agencys field directors 
stack also told the regional offices to determine whether nlrb 
officers quoted in a recent report by the national right to work 
committee had in fact provided the information attributed to them in 
the antiunion groups report 
stack declined comment when asked whether the nlrb agreed that 
some of its information officers had provided inaccurate 
information but when asked why he ordered new training he said 
anytime i find out that there is a need for training the correct 
thing to do is see that the training is conducted 
the right to work committee in a study released this month said 
nlrb information officers often provided inaccurate information when 
questioned about employees rights under a 1988 supreme court 
decision 
in the decision the high court ruled that employees hired by 
companies whose workforce is represented by unions cannot be forced 
to join the union but can be required to pay dues to help pay the 
costs of negotiating and administering contracts the court said 
workers could not be required to pay dues in excess of those amounts 
in effect allowing workers who disagree with the political 
activities of the union that represents them to withhold partial 
dues 
the right to work committee said it hired a private investigator 
who telephoned 34 nlrb offices in states that allow compulsory 
unionism and claimed to be an employee who had been recently hired 
and informed that he had to join a union and pay union dues 
information officers at 22 of the offices said workers could be 
required to pay full union dues the group said in its study 
when the survey was released earlier this month nlrb spokesman 
dave parker dismissed its findings and said i would think it 
improbable that our field offices would not provide accurate 
information to an employee about what rights he has 
but the next day aug 10 stack sent his memo to the regional 
directors ordering the additional training and an investigation into 
whether the right to work committees account was accurate during 
the training stack said information officers should be given a 
copy of a november 1988 internal nlrb memo outlining the supreme 
court decision commonly referred to as the beck decision after 
harry beck the man who sued the communications workers of america 
for the right to withhold partial dues

the chairman of the house banking committee 
says he will reopen his panels investigation of the failure of 
lincoln savings and loan association expected to require the 
governments largestever thrift rescue 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas branded the collapse of the 
thrift based in irvine calif a miniwatergate he said his 
committee had suspended its probe only because of the pressing need 
to pass emergency legislation bailing out the savings and loan 
industry 
now that congress has passed the bill gonzalez vowed to clear up 
the scandal once and for all 
previously gonzalez has criticized m danny wall director of the 
office of thrift supervision for delaying regulatory action against 
lincoln and allowing the thrifts losses to balloon 
the probe is sure to examine political contributions from charles 
h keating jr the chairman of lincolns parent firm american 
continental corp of phoenix to five senators who later met with 
regulators about lincoln 
they are sens alan cranston dcalif john glenn dohio 
dennis deconcini dariz john mccain rariz and donald w 
riegle jr dmich riegle who is chairman of the senate banking 
committee later returned keatings contribution 
lincoln is under the control of the resolution trust corp the 
new agency created earlier this month to rescue and close the 
nations insolvent thrift institutions analysts expect that lincoln 
will be the costliest of more than 400 resolutions 
we already know that at least 15 billion has been lost in the 
lincoln fiasco with more to come as the mess is cleaned up 
gonzalez said in a statement monday 
lincoln remains a miniwatergate in federal financial 
regulations and it is important that the public and the congress 
know why it happened and specifically who was responsible he said 
gonzalez said the committee will also reexamine the spate of 
lastminute sampl rescues conducted by the federal home loan bank 
board last december and he said the panel will be overseeing the 
rtcs disposition of real estate particularly in texas where the 
savings and loan problem has been concentrated

the nuclear regulatory commission has urged a 
california utility to decide soon whether to sell or dismantle its 
rancho seco nuclear power plant which voters said last june should 
close 
thomas murley director of the commissions office of nuclear 
reactor regulation told officials of the sacramento municipal 
utility district on tuesday that uncertainty about the fate of the 
913megawatt plant was making it difficult to plan regulatory 
changes there 
it does make it awkward to keep carrying these options for a 
long period of time murley told the officials in a meeting at nrc 
headquarters the unusual circumstances of the plants forced 
shutdown has put it in uncharted waters he said 
other commission staff members noted for example that they may 
need to know the plants fate before deciding whether to approve the 
utilitys plan for reducing its emergency staff or its request to be 
exempted from an onsite emergency exercise 
the nrc must approve any transfer of the utility districts 
nuclear license to another operator but it also must approve the 
various regulatory adjustments required in the event the plant is 
decommissioned and eventually dismantled 
david a boggs general manager of the utility district assured 
murley and other commission staff members that the question of 
whether to sell rancho seco would be resolved very soon 
boggs said efforts to sell the 15yearold plant probably will be 
abandoned if no agreement is reached by friday with quadrex corp of 
campbell calif 
i do not see anyone else coming forward to continue this 
process of negotiating to buy the plant boggs said adding later 
that he was cautiously optimistic that a deal could be worked 
out this week with quadrex 
the rancho seco station has been shut down since june 7 the day 
after utility district residents voted against keeping the plant 
running it was the first time an operating nuclear power plant was 
closed by voter initiative 
the vote did not explicitly prohibit the utility from selling the 
plant and a buyer such as quadrex could be allowed to run it if the 
nrc approves a license transfer under such circumstances quadrex 
would have to restart the reactor 
if a deal is struck with quadrex and arrangements are set for 
the utility to buy back some of the power generated by rancho seco 
then the districts board of directors would vote on it sept 7 
boggs said 
any proposed sale would be put to a public vote tentatively 
scheduled for dec 12 
boggs and other officials of the utility also told the nrc they 
were offering key workers special severance agreements in order to 
keep them from quitting licensed operators for example are being 
assured they will get the equivalent of six months salary in the 
event they are laid off money they wouldnt get if they resigned

to repay the carriers 31 billion debt with cash from its 
operations including income from saleleaseback arrangements on 
aircraft congressional auditors say 
through 1993 the airline will have at least 635 million a year 
left over after servicing its debt and paying taxes according to an 
analysis by the general accounting office 
the gao the investigative arm of congress prepared the report 
for the chairman of the house aviation subcommittee rep james 
oberstar dminn who planned a hearing this fall on the sale of 
the airlines parent company nwa inc to a group led by california 
investor alfred checchi 
the leveraged buyout will give northwest one of the highest debt 
loads in the industry and transportation secretary samuel skinner 
is investigating the sale to determine whether it will compromise 
the carriers safety 
skinner who could ground the eagan minnbased airline if he 
believes it is unsafe is expected to finish his investigation next 
month 
checchi filed documents with the securities and exchange 
commission saying he expects to repay the carriers debt through 
cash flow from its operations the gao report said its analysis 
shows the claim appears to be true 
for 1989 the airline would have 18 billion in cash available 
including 364 million in income from operations and 834 million 
from selling aircraft and then leasing them back 
after servicing debt paying taxes and meeting other expenses 
the airline would have 166 million left over according to the 
report 
by 1993 the company is projected to have income of 21 billion 
including 570 million in revenue from the saleleaseback 
arrangements after debt payments and other expenses the airline 
would have excess cash of 635 million according to the report 
the airline could cover any cash shortfalls by selling japanese 
real estate it owns or drawing on a 250 million line of credit the 
gao said 
the report confirms what the airline has been saying about the 
buyout in public statements and government filings kevin whalen a 
spokesman for the carrier said tuesday 
were committed to continuing to grow the airline to continue 
making it more and more competitive and to handle the debt load 
brought on by the purchase in a prudent business manner whalen 
said 
however the new debt weakens northwests financial ratios and 
creates lower income due to higher interest payments the gao said

the overseers of the new agency created to 
dismantle failed savings institutions have given regulators 
permission to get started on big complex deals 
but the resolution trust corp oversight board headed by 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady said tuesday the overseers 
still want to be consulted before regulators give final approval to 
complex transactions 
the policy directive issued by the oversight board after a 
private telephone conference was the latest salvo in the 
squabbling between bank regulators in charge of handling failed sampls 
and the administration officials who control the purse strings 
the law signed by president bush on aug 9 authorized 50 billion 
in spending on failed sampls and created a twotier bureaucracy for 
handling the work 
the federal deposit insurance corp an independent regulatory 
agency got control of the resolution trust corp or rtc which is 
doing the disposal work 
but bradys oversight board which also includes federal reserve 
chairman alan greenspan and housing secretary jack kemp sets the 
policies governing how the 50 billion is to be spent 
the fdic has been chafing under the arrangement last week fdic 
chairman l william seidman said regulators have been ready to put 
five multibilliondollar institutions up for sale but have had to 
delay action driving up the ultimate cost of the sampl crisis 
regulators held off because the oversight board directed them to 
complete only relatively simple transactions until it decides 
probably within several weeks on a policy for disposal techniques 
for large institutions 
so far the fdic has closed 11 small sampls transferring their 
deposits to other institutions or paying off customers directly but 
it has not tackled the kind of large deals that require the 
government to issue guarantees or assume part ownership of a rescued 
sampl 
oversight board spokesman art siddon said the policy was revised 
tuesday to point out that simple does not mean small and that 
regulators can get started on complex deals 
members of the congressional banking committees who are on 
vacation until after labor day are expressing concern about the 
intramural squabbling saying they intended that the fdic would be 
able to move swiftly without undue restrictions 
in a second move the oversight board told the fdic to make 
disposing of failed sampls its first priority after that it should 
be ready to deploy funds to resolve depositor runs the third 
priority is replacing highcost deposits with lowcost government 
funds 
the insertion of the second priority effectively replaces 
arrangements made early this year under which the federal reserve 
treasury and regional federal home loan banks agreed jointly to pump 
cash into any institutions suffering liquidity problems

amr corp stock jumped 12 percent on tuesday as 
speculation surfaced that the parent of american airlines had 
retained two investment firms to help defend it against unwanted 
takeovers 
news reports said amr had retained salomon brothers inc and 
goldman sachs amp co to advise the fort worthbased company but amr 
remained mum on the speculation 
we have been directed by senior management not to comment in 
any way spokesman jim brown said 
amr common stock rose 1025 to close at 9150 per share in 
composite trading on the new york stock exchange more than 386 
million shares changed hands the third most active stock traded on 
the big board tuesday 
other transportation stocks also increased in what analysts said 
was anticipation of continued takeover activity in the industry the 
dow jones transportation average which includes amr and six other 
airlines in its 20 stocks finished up 1369 at 150658 the fourth 
consecutive record close 
ual corp object of 275 per share or 619 billion takeover 
bid by investor marvin davis closed down 425 at 27725 but 
other airline companies including delta air lines inc texas air 
corp and southwest airlines co were up on various exchanges 
transportation stocks have been actively traded in the wake of 
davis bid for ual plus the recent buyout of northwest airlines 
parent nwa inc by alfred checchi 
the latest fad is airline takeovers said lee howard vice 
president of airline economics inc an industry consultant in 
washington dc 
they have substantial assets sitting out there which makes them 
good takeover targets youre seeing a continuation of what happened 
to northwest and united howard said 
amr estimated by some analysts to be worth 114 per share in a 
takeover recently adopted a shareholders rights plan designed to 
make a buyout more expensive 
amr has reported four straight quarters of record profits with 
secondquarter earnings jumping 258 percent to 1779 million 
within the past year the airline has replaced united as the 
nations no 1 carrier and has embarked on a multibilliondollar 
expansion program that includes scores of new jets plus a new 
maintenance facility and plans for a 1 billion terminal at its base

federal express mapping its foray into 
global competition in air cargo transportation has dropped the 
fasttalking humorous advertising campaign which promised to 
deliver packages absolutely positively overnight 
the memphis company that dominates the nations overnight market 
instead has adopted new documentarystyle television commercials 
touting safety reliability and technical expertise 
the change is part of the companys effort to expand 
internationally and become the worlds leading transportation 
company 
federal express merged on aug 7 with international air freight 
carrier flying tigers through which it acquired an air cargo 
network of 119 countries 
analysts say the flying tiger acquisition has given federal 
express two sets of customers businesses to which it sells services 
directly and freight forwards which buy services for resale to 
shippers flying tigers sold its heavy freight service primarily 
through freight forwarders 
and the analysts say a change in the companys advertising 
approach is only natural given federal express expanded clientele 
you are not going to sell the heavyweight business the same way 
you sell an overnight letter said david guthrie an analyst with 
morgan keegan amp co in memphis 
with an overnight letter you are dealing with an individual 
who may be relatively unsophisticated someone shipping heavy 
freight is going to be sophisticated i dont think you are going to 
sell to those kind of people with a funny ad guthrie said 
david shoenfeld vice president of international marketing for 
federal express said the companys marketing focus will continue to 
shift from nextday delivery to reliability 
absolutely positively overnight really is not a message 
thats available to us internationally simply because some things 
just cant be overnight shoenfeld said 
shoenfeld cites one selling point as the fact that federal 
express flies its own aircraft to 30 international airports instead 
of relying primarily on cargo space in passenger airlines as 
competitors do 
when all of the integration has taken place i think we will 
see federal express become the global standard he said 
federal express as a newcomer in the heavyweight freight 
business faces stiff competition from a host of new competitors 
including japan air lines and lufthansa german airlines 
its us archrival united parcel service announced on monday 
plans to expand its package delivery service to 175 countries and 
territories it also is planning a new ad campaign promoting its 
worldwide service

a canadian partnership has raised its hostile bid 
for dunkin donuts inc to 308 million despite a lawsuit pending in 
delaware chancery court officials said 
kingsbridge capital group and cara operations ltd officials 
partners in dd acquisition corp said tuesday they had raised their 
bid from 43 to 45 a share regardless of how the delaware judge 
rules in the trial that begins sept 11 
unless extended the offer expires sept 15 the torontobased 
partnership said 
the offer is there and isnt contingent on success in court 
said eric w evans a kingsbridge associate director 
he said dd acquisition would continue its bid if the court finds 
dunkin donuts was within its rights when it set up a series of 
tough defenses including an employee stock ownership plan which 
holds about 16 percent of its outstanding common shares 
the company also has a shareholder rights plan or poison 
pill designed to increase the number of shares in the event of a 
takeover making a merger prohibitively expensive 
and it has sold 28 million of preferred stock convertible to an 
11 percent stake in the company to an avowedly friendly investor 
general electric capital corp 
we think we have a very good case in court and that the court 
will find that those measures were improperly put in place but even 
if they werent well still continue with the bid evans said 
he said the offer was however valid only if 501 percent of 
dunkin donuts common shares were tendered on a fully diluted basis 
the board of directors at dunkin donuts said in a prepared 
statement tuesday that a meeting to evaluate the revised tender 
offer with the assistance of the companys outside legal and 
financial advisors would be scheduled the company urged 
stockholders not to act until officials had made their 
recommendation 
based on publicly available financial information on dunkin 
donuts including its results for the most recent quarter we 
believe this revised offer is generous and fair earl i rotman 
president of kingsbridge said in a prepared statement 
dunkin donuts reported a 34 percent drop in thirdquarter 
earnings much of which it attributed to costs associated with 
battling the hostile takeover 
the doughnut shop chain reported earnings for the three months 
ended july 29 of 21 million or 24 cents a share on revenue of 
303 million compared with earnings of 32 million or 49 cents a 
share on revenue of 292 million 
for the nine months ended july 29 dunkin donuts reported 
earnings totaled 762 million or 108 a share on revenue of 897 
million down 227 percent from 986 million or 149 a share on 
revenue of 824 million for the same period a year ago

consumer advocates and physicians say theres 
no reason to doubt the safety and effectiveness of most generic 
drugs and consumers appear to be heeding that advice 
i dont think theres panic in the streets i think theyre 
concerned said harold cohen editor of the trade publication drug 
store newsinside pharmacy referring to drug consumers 
cohen who has been visiting pharmacies in st louis phoenix and 
washington dc for the past week said monday he saw few customers 
switching from a generic to a brandname drug 
as far as we know there is no problem with safety at this time 
and no problem that is one that would make people stop taking 
generic drugs dr frank young commissioner of the food and drug 
administration said today 
if you are concerned see your physician but dont switch 
without really checking with someone first he said on cbs this 
morning 
disclosures of fraud and corruption in the fdas generic drug 
division have tainted the agencys reputation and cast doubts on the 
industry as well as the safety and efficacy of generic medicines 
we are just as shocked dismayed and angry as i think consumers 
are with the despicable events that were perpetrated by a few 
generic companies young said adding that were not going to 
rest until this is cleaned up 
youngs assurances of the safety of generics echoed those of 
other physicians and consumer advocates 
at the present time theres no evidence that any generic drugs 
out there in the pharmacies lack safety or effectiveness said dr 
sidney wolfe head of the public citizen health research group 
dr ray w gifford a trustee of the american medical association 
who is also an internist at the cleveland clinic and a clinical 
pharmacologist agreed 
what weve seen in the past few weeks is regrettable but i 
dont think it reflects all generics and it really hasnt changed my 
prescribing habits he said 
however gifford said most physicians already insist on 
brandname drugs for certain hardtotreat conditions such as 
congestive heart failure 
there doesnt seem to be a surge of phone calls or people 
bringing back bags of drugs said james krahulec vice president 
of government affairs for rite aid the nations largest drugstore 
chain 
krahulec said his chain was surveying its nearly 2300 stores to 
gauge public reaction to the scandal enveloping the generic drug 
industry but no one has called in with panic information 
the fda has initiated steps in the past month to pull from the 
market products manufactured by several generic drug companies 
in the latest move the agency said monday it wants to remove 
bolar pharmaceuticals co incs generic version of dyazide a 
popular drug used to treat high blood pressure the fda said it 
found no evidence of fraud 
the copiague nybased bolar which says it will appeal within 
the 30day limit said the problem stems from confusion over a 
clerical error in identification of samples used in safety tests 
the fda also has expanded federal inspections of 11 generic drug 
makers to include the plants of 20 additional generic companies and 
is reviewing 30 of the most commonly used generic drugs 
the main question raised about the drugs is whether they work as 
effectively as the brandname drug whether they are absorbed into 
the body at the same rate as the drug they mimic 
wolfe said potency problems were rarely of any significance in 
most cases he said doctors prescribe the same dose of medicine for 
a 125pound adult as for a 250pound adult 
for most drugs there is a wide range over which the drug will 
be effective and safe he said this cuts through a lot of the 
extent to which people are overreacting to the problems that have 
been brought to light 
generic drugs are copies of brandname medicines and are usually 
much less expensive a third of all prescriptions written in the 
united states are filled with generic drugs according to the 
generic pharmaceutical industry association

a group of eight franchisees said today it has 
offered more than 200 million in cash to buy arbys fast food chain 
from dwg corp the holding company controlled by industrialist 
victor posner 
the group calling itself rb partners ltd said it made the 
offer aug 1 in a letter to posner who has so far not responded to 
the proposal 
in a letter to fellow franchisees also released today the group 
said posners legal and financial problems could threaten the future 
of atlantabased arbys 
posner pleaded no contest in 1987 to federal income tax evasion 
and was sentenced last year to five years probation on the condition 
that he pay all his back taxes penalties and interest the cost of 
prosecuting his case and create a 3 million homeless fund

unaffected by all these pressures on mr posner and dwg the

marketing franchising and service company for the 2100store

lessening the chance for an early frost that would curb harvest 
yields 
the corn harvest is a month away 
traders saw that forecast and one calling for more rain in the 
region by the end of the week as negative 
but analysts said corn traders bought on reports that east 
germany is looking to buy half a million tons of us corn 
in early trading wheat was unchanged to 1 cent lower with the 
contract for delivery in september at 383 a bushel corn was 
cent to 1 cent higher with september at 232 a bushel oats were 1

personal incomes rose a healthy 07 percent in 
july the best gain in four months while consumer spending climbed 
at its fastest pace in three months the government reported today 
the commerce department said that consumer spending rose 07 
percent in july it was the best gain since a 12 percent rise in 
april and followed a much weaker 02 percent june increase 
the 07 percent rise in personal incomes followed a 05 percent 
june increase and was the fastest advance since a 1 percent increase 
in march 
the statistics on americans income growth and spending habits 
provided fresh evidence that the economy is not in danger of 
toppling into a recession the report showed that consumer spending 
which accounts for twothirds of all economic activity is being 
bolstered by healthy gains in income 
just a month ago economists were not as certain about the state 
of the economy however a string of government statistics since 
that time have shown that the economy and in particular the 
consumer sector is not as weak as earlier feared 
last month the government reported that consumer spending after 
removing the effects of inflation had declined in both may and 
june but in todays report the inflationadjusted figures were 
revised upward to show modest increases of 01 percent in both may 
and june 
on tuesday the government significantly revised upward its 
estimate of total economic growth showing that the gross national 
product was growing at a healthy annual rate of 27 percent in the 
apriljune quarter instead of the anemic 17 percent gnp rate 
originally reported most of that revision stemmed from the fact 
that the rate of consumer spending was doubled from what the 
government originally estimated 
todays report showed that consumer spending continued strong 
going into the first month of the julyseptember quarter many 
economists have been busy revising upward their estimates for 
overall economic growth this year pushing their forecasts closer to 
the 29 percent gnp target set by the bush administration 
the july report showed that americans income after taxes also 
rose 07 percent in july down slightly from a 08 percent aftertax 
increase in june 
with incomes growing at the same rate as spending in july 
americans savings rate savings as a percent of disposable income 
held steady at 57 percent this is the highest level for savings 
since a 62 percent rate in march 
the key component of the income category wages and salaries 
increased 254 billion in july up substantially from a 176 
billion june increase this advance occurred despite the fact that 
payrolls at manufacturing companies rose by only 14 billion down 
from a june increase of 29 billion 
on the spending side the 254 billion rise in personal 
consumption spending which includes everything except interest 
payments on debt compared to a 66 billion june advance purchases 
of durable goods items expected to last three or more years 
increased 76 billion up sharply from a 26 billion june increase 
purchases of nondurable goods increased 46 billion compared to 
a small 200 million decline in june 
purchases of services which includes housing costs increased 
132 billion compared to a june increase of 42 billion 
overall personal consumption spending came in at an annual rate 
of 348 trillion in july following a revised level of 346 
trillion in june 
personal incomes totaled 450 trillion at an annual rate in 
july following a revised 442 trillion in june

with one day to go before directors of ual corp 
face a deadline for responding to a 619 billion takeover offer 
the unions representing united airlines largest worker groups are 
scrambling to protect their interests 
suitor marvin davis a day after meeting with representatives of 
the association of flight attendants said tuesday he wont ask for 
labor concessions from uniteds unions the chicago suntimes 
reported today 
davis issued a statement saying that mondays talks with the 
flight attendants in san francisco conclude the first round of talks 
between his group and the unions it was the first admission by 
davis that he has met with uniteds pilots union whose approval is 
considered crucial to any takeover the newspaper reported 
meantime leaders of the pilots union opened a twoday meeting 
tuesday in new york where they reportedly were discussing the 
possibility of participating in a management buyout of chicagobased 
ual uniteds parent company 
the machinists union which represents uniteds largest worker 
group met friday with davis the los angeles billionaire who is 
seeking to buy ual to spell out the expectations of uniteds 
mechanics and technical workers should they support his bid 
and uniteds flight attendants have urged uals board to resume 
contract negotiations saying that in the event of an auction the 
airline will be more valuable with settled contracts the talks 
recently broke down after about two years 
davis has given uals board until thursday to respond to his 
275ashare offer which he raised from 240 a share on aug 16 
the new york meeting of leaders of the united chapter of the air 
line pilots association was believed to be focused on the 
maneuvering for control of the nations secondlargest airline said 
james hanson a spokesman for the united pilots in chicago 
theyre dealing with all this takeover stuff and its impact on 
the pilots but i couldnt give you any specifics on what is going to 
be discussed he said 
the new york times reported tuesday that representatives of the 
pilots union and chicagobased ual had spent the weekend putting 
together a package to present to the united chapters 27member 
master executive council 
pilot leaders and ual officials reportedly have met several times 
in the three weeks since davis initial offer was revealed to 
discuss an employeemanagement buyout or a recapitalization that 
would put enough stock in an employee stock ownership plan to fend 
off a hostile takeover attempt 
united pilots have been seeking an ownership role in the airline 
since 1987 industry analysts have speculated that management might 
invite employees to join in a buyout of ual in exchange for contract 
concessions that could end longrunning labor disputes between the 
company and its pilots and flight attendants unions 
without the support of the flight attendants and machinists the 
pilots might have to assume a heavier financial burden in the form 
of deeper contract concessions 
alpa represents most of uniteds 6300 pilots the association of 
flight attendants which represents another 12700 united workers 
has urged the ual board to proceed with caution 
in a letter to the board last week the attendants called for a 
resumption of contract talks 
the united chapter of the international association of machinists 
and aerospace workers which represents 25000 of uals 70000 
employees said last friday in a letter to the ual board that they 
would vigorously oppose any buyout or restructuring of the 
company 
but the times said tuesday that brian freeman the adviser to the 
machinists met friday with davis and outlined what the machinists 
would expect if they supported his bid 
representatives of the flight attendants and the machinists did 
not return calls tuesday

the grape harvest in the bordeaux wine 
region has begun several weeks earlier than usual because of hot 
dry weather and growers predict an exceptionally good vintage 
jeanbernard delmas director of chateau hautbrion said picking 
of grapes destined for white wines began tuesday in his vineyards 
with the red wine harvest likely to start later in the week 
i can assure you at least if it doesnt rain that the 1989 
vintage will be the greatest in the century delmas said 
he said it was the first time since 1893 that the harvest has 
opened before sept 1 at chateau hautbrion 
because conditions can differ markedly even between nearby 
vineyards the harvest starts at varying times 
the hot and dry conditions that lead to early harvest give the 
grapes an unusually high sugar level they are likely to produce a 
comparatively small amount of wine but of very high quality 
according to the interprofessional council of the wines of bordeaux

oilman and takeover strategist t boone pickens 
said today he will not run for texas governor because he could not 
give all his attention to the states problems 
i cant make that commitment at this stage in my life 
pickens said ive decided without regrets that i have other 
challenges and other responsibilities 
pickens made the disclosure to about 500 people at a rotary 
luncheon he said he must devote full attention to his business 
pickens 61 chairman of mesa limited partnership of amarillo 
signed a contract on a 2 million home in the dallas area earlier 
this month the dallas times herald reported tuesday his firms 
financial division also is moving from amarillo to downtown dallas 
although pickens said the moves were for business and not 
political reasons he also said he faced some business problems that 
could block his path in a race for governor 
his partnership announced a 134 million loss for the second 
quarter of 1989 and he said today the company will likely post a 
loss in the third quarter 
mesa will weather the tough times but i have a responsibility 
to my shareholders to see this through pickens said 
pickens initially said he would announce a decision by aug 15 
then later delayed that announcement until the end of the month 
republicans who have announced for governor so far are midland 
oilmanbusinessman jack rains who was secretary of state until 
resigning this summer railroad commissioner kent hance and oilman 
clayton williams of midland 
the only announced democratic candidate is state treasurer ann 
richards 
pickens a feared corporate raider who has chased some of the 
biggest us companies made headlines earlier this summer by trying 
to get three seats on the board of directors of a japanese headlight 
manufacturer 
shareholders of koito manufacturing co voted overwhelmingly 
against naming pickens to the board even though he was the 
companys largest shareholder with 202 percent of the stock

texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo has met 
with donald j trump in an effort to persuade the new york developer 
to buy continental airlines a trump associate said wednesday 
mr lorenzo and mr trump have spoken said bruce nobles 
president of trump shuttle which the developer purchased from 
lorenzo last june for 365 million 
but trump has concerns about a potential purchase of continental 
a subsidiary of texas air nobles said noting that trump is 
concerned about continentals 25 billion debt its small cash 
reserves and the need to refurbish many of its planes 
while trump remains interested and believes his name would help 
the houstonbased carrier win passengers he has not been convinced 
that the risks are acceptable nobles said in a telephone interview 
his trumps concerns are well put said nobles a former 
texas air and pan am corp official 
trump was unavailable for comment wednesday a spokesman said 
art kent a texas air spokesman in houston said lorenzo had no 
comment on the matter 
in talks with trump said to have been held over the past month 
lorenzo said his negative image has hurt continental according to 
sources quoted in wednesdays editions of the new york times 
lorenzo announced last thursday that houstonbased texas air the 
nations largest airline company may consider selling a minority or 
controlling interest in continental 
strikebound eastern airlines texas airs other airline 
subsidiary apparently would not be involved in any continental 
transaction 
last week lorenzo told the associated press that one reason he 
was considering selling a stake in continental was that the bitter 
struggle with easterns unions had hurt traffic at continental 
texas air is also involved in talks about selling a major stake 
in continental to scandinavian airlines system and an unidentified 
partner the wall street journal reported monday texas air declined 
to comment on the report 
sas already has a 99 percent stake in texas air as part of a 
joint marketing agreement 
sources were quoted by the times as saying that lorenzo was 
impressed with the way traffic on the former eastern air shuttle in 
the northeast picked up since trump bought it 
trumps share of the lucrative northeast shuttle market split 
with pan am has approximately doubled since we took over 
nobles said although he declined to give precise figures he said 
trump shuttles market share has jumped from around 25 percent when 
it started operations in early june to about 50 percent currently 
i think being separated from eastern is a positive having the 
trump name is a positive having better service is a positive 
nobles said 
but rival pan am disputed nobles estimate of current market 
share pan am spokeswoman pamela hanlon said the pan am shuttles 
share at around 75 percent when trump started up is now holding at 
roughly 60 percent 
were quite pleased with the clientele that we think weve been 
able to keep since they started she said 
the times quoted its sources as saying that sas favored a deal 
with continental involving trump 
sas board member kaj ikast said tuesday that the carrier was not 
near a decision on taking a stake in continental ikast told the 
times there have been talks with texas air about buying such a stake

has been criticized by the state for its inadequate handling of the 
11milliongallon spill 
arco also reported that alyeska has received two subpoenas 
rumors of a grand jury investigation have been circulating since 
the tanker damaged its hull on bligh reef but the aug 11 sec filing

in a small corner room at the world trade center 
an elite group of people with gifted taste buds speedy slurps and 
an appreciation of caffeine gather for a special mission to decide 
the fate of billions of beans 
equipped with cups silver spittoons and freshly roasted brew 
that would shame any doughnut shop the tasters judge whether coffee 
grown in 46 countries meets the standards of the new york coffee 
sugar amp cocoa exchange 
its a job that has become more important because of the 
suspension of coffee export limits this summer which resulted in a 
flood of beans pouring into the united states the worlds biggest 
coffee market 
rejection could mean huge losses for importers and brokers 
particularly now that producers cant rely on the agreement to sell 
their coffee beans and therefore must compete on quality 
though the rejected coffee isnt discarded it may sit longer in 
a warehouse could be sold at a discount or end up as a roasted 
blend or genericbrand instant the coffee equivalent of an old 
horse sent to the glue factory 
on this particular day about 2 million worth of coffee or 
nearly 25 million pounds is at stake but there were periods in 
the last two years when all was quiet in whats known in coffee 
parlance as the grading room 
there was absolutely nothing going on for 4 to 5 months 
nothing zero says glenn garnes grading room assistant at the 
exchange where coffee sugar and cocoa contracts are traded 
coffee sold quickly in those days because of export quotas set by 
the international coffee organization the cartel of producers that 
artificially determined prices through limiting the supply 
tight supplies and high demand meant that a lot of coffee 
bypassed the exchange and went directly to brokers or roasters 
with more beans to judge these days the tasters must slurp more 
mouthfuls of coffee since theyre paid by the number of bags 
tested their take has increased to about 630 for nearly two hours 
work which amounts to more than 12 a slurp during normal periods 
they earn about 200 
on july 4 the ico temporarily suspended export ceilings that had 
kept wholesale prices at between 120 and 140 a pound us 
roasters had criticized the quotas for limiting access to quality 
coffee 
with coffee pouring into the united states prices have tumbled 
nearly 40 percent and made it a buyers market 
further depressing prices is the normal slow summer roasting 
period a longterm decline in us coffee consumption and efforts 
by producers to empty warehouses before the new harvest starting in 
september 
if the market is already at these levels in anticipation of new 
crops what will happen when the new crop actually comes says 
bert ruiz industry analyst with the new york brokerage firm balfour 
maclaine corp 
retail prices also have fallen two of the biggest roasters 
general foods corp and procter amp gamble co which have about 65 
percent of the us coffee market announced big price cuts aug 7 
general foods which markets maxwell house and sanka coffees 
said it dropped the average price it charges retailers 23 cents a 
pound for ground roasted coffee procter amp gamble marketer of 
folgers lowered its price by 20 cents to about 250 a pound 
theres not much talking in the grading room as the testers judge 
the coffee first by color and grade or purity working in teams of 
three they sort through pans of small green coffee beans for 
imperfections brown black rotten or faded beans 
dirt and other impurities count against the batch every five bad 
beans or one black bean equals one imperfection fifteen 
imperfections disqualifies the entire lot 
color also is important because as coffee ages it loses moisture 
and fades says taster steve colten quality control manager for j 
aron amp co coffee importers colten and the 26 other graders 
including two women recently added to the erstwhile male group 
leave jobs or other activities to grade coffee 
each pan representing one 37500pound lot is numbered so the 
testers know only the country of origin 
we work blind so nothing biases our opinion says bill 
griffin former senior buyer for nestle foods corp 
knowing the country is important because shades of color differ 
as do acidity and flavor tasters say coffees with earthy fermenty 
characteristics passable for one countrys coffees wouldnt be for 
another 
a tantalizing aroma fills the room as the beans are thrown into 
oldfashioned roasters for browning over an open flame the beans 
are then ground and steeped in boiling water in preparation for 
tasting the ultimate proving ground 
with a loud slurp ray schlegelmilch sucks in a spoonful of brew 
twirls it around his tongue and spits into a silver spittoon near 
his feet quickly adjusting the swiveltop table he brings the next 
cup into position breaks through the film of grounds atop the 
liquid scoops another mouthful and repeats the ritual in a matter 
of seconds he has tasted 21 cups 
body the right twinge of acidity and a good bouquet or aroma 
are important but tasters look for negative rather than positive 
characteristics says justin colten a former executive with j 
aron who believes coffee tasting is a very unique art 
anything off odor a dirty groundy or musty smell or 
that tastes too acidic leathery fermented medicinal or earthy is 
rejected 
this day a mexican coffee that has already passed color and 
grade tests is rejected on taste garnes calls the importer who 
requests a second opinion three more tasters are asked to judge the 
brew it passes on second tasting 
the testers all current or retired coffeeindustry executives 
are purists about coffee outside the grading room too some are so 
choosy they wont buy coffee already roasted much less ground 
several buy raw beans and roast them at home 
anyone in the coffee business is very picky about their 
coffee says steve colten 
as for the latest fad flavored coffee which is marinated in 
liquid flavorings ranging from cinnamon to coconut the tasters 
turn up their noses 
its adulterated says one 
no one grows cinnamon nut flavored coffee says another if 
you get a good cup of coffee you dont need flavorings you dont 
even need cream or sugar

in addition more rain is expected to move into the midwest by 
the end of the week adding further downward pressure to prices

exxon corp said wednesday it has named marine 
scientist john h steele as a director in response to shareholder 
demands for the addition of an environmental expert following the 
nations worst oil spill 
steele 62 is president and a senior scientist at woods hole 
oceanographic institution he also will serve on the boards newly 
formed public issues committee which will monitor the companys 
environmental policies 
this is a good day for the environment and exxon 
shareholders said comptroller harrison j goldin trustee for new 
yorks employee firefighter and police pension funds 
new york was one of several pension funds with large holdings of 
exxon stock that has publicized its dissatisfaction with the oil 
giants handling of the march 24 spill and cleanup effort 
the funds which included new york state and the california 
public employee retirement system the largest individual us 
public pension fund had called for exxon to appoint a director with 
expertise and interest in the environment 
goldin said the appointment demonstrates environmental and 
social responsibility in the aftermath of the disaster in which 
the tanker exxon valdez hit a charted reef and spewed millions of 
gallons of oil into prince william sound 
in a telephone interview from his office in woods hole mass 
about 70 miles south of boston on the southeast end of cape cod 
steele spoke of the spill 
i think its a terrible tragedy and a major disaster not just 
for the animals but for the people in alaska steele said 
he declined to comment on exxons handling of the cleanup but 
said he would visit alaska in about two weeks for a separate 
scientific meeting on arctic research and would view the remnants of 
the spill at that time 
it will give me an opportunity to discuss these research and 
scientific questions with colleagues in alaska he said 
steele will serve on the board until exxons annual shareholders 
meeting next april when his name will be submitted for shareholder 
approval along with the other directors said exxon spokesman bill 
smith 
at the companys annual shareholders last may shareholders 
demanded changes in what they called exxons inadequate state of 
preparedness for dealing with future problems 
although the funds ultimately voted for management this year 
they warned of a major shareholder revolt next year if the exxon 
appointment was unsatisfactory to dissident shareholders 
at the may meeting exxon management agreed to create the 
sixmember public issues committee which includes four nonexxon 
employees exxon said the committee would review the corporations 
policies programs and practices on public issues of significance 
including their effects on the environment and worker safety and 
health 
steeles appointment increases the size of the exxon board to 15 
including ten nonemployee directors 
born in edinburgh scotland steeles career includes 26 years at 
the marine laboratory at aberdeen scotland he joined woods hole 
oceanographic institution in 1977 
steeles principal research includes the marine environment he 
is the us delegate to the international council for exploration of 
the sea

if youre looking for an unfinished luxury home 
with no utilities but such extras as graffiti declaring led 
zeppelin rules frank norris has just the place for you 
norris and an army of bureaucrats like him are ready to deal 
they work for the resolution trust corp an agency created aug 9 
when president bush signed legislation bailing out the savings and 
loan industry 
norris 55 manages commonwealth savings association a houston 
thrift institution with 16 billion in assets and 600 million in 
red ink 
along with others working for the rtc hes trying to sell 
thousands of repossessed properties the government is inheriting 
from as many as 600 failed thrift institutions 
the properties range from runofthemill to the exotic from 
apartment buildings shopping centers and office towers to a 
windmill farm a buffalo sperm bank and the entire town of lehigh 
acres fla population 25000 
no one knows for certain how much its all worth the 
governments own estimate 300 billion to 500 billion leaves a 
wide margin for error 
but even at the low end of the range the rtc when running at 
full capacity will in effect be the largest financial institution 
in the country twice as large as citicorp the nations biggest 
bank 
already lawyers accountants and real estate specialists are 
swarming hoping to secure contracts as consultants helping 
regulators manage and sell the property speculators are circling 
hoping to buy cheap 
a handful of newsletters devoted solely to covering the agency 
have sprung up one the resolution trust reporter advertised for 
subscribers at 398 a year by asking whos going to cash in when 
the resolution trust corp opens its doors how about you 
consumer watchdogs warn the task is so mammoth and so difficult 
that scandal is inevitable scandal dwarfing the troubles now 
plaguing the department of housing and urban development 
whether or not these dire predictions prove true largely depends 
on norris and other federal agents managing 260 of the most deeply 
insolvent sampls already under government control in 33 states 
they are the antithesis of the highfliers who drove the sampls 
into the red by making fraudulent loans and spending depositors 
funds on lavish parties and corporate jets 
on the job they may sit in paneled executive suites and oversee 
hundreds of employees but on their own time they drive rented 
cars live out of suitcases and eat in cafeterias for lunch 
how well they perform likely will be the critical factor in 
deciding whether the government successfully completes the sampl 
bailout without turning to the taxpayers for more money 
if the rtc sells the property it is inheriting too fast or too 
cheaply it could ruin real estate values across the oilproducing 
regions of the southwest further narrowing the taxpayers chances 
of recovering part of their contribution to the bailout estimated 
at 1000 each 
if it keeps the property too long maintenance and other costs 
could quickly pile up offsetting any gain realized by holding out 
for a higher price 
the problem is that much of it is virtually unsellable at any 
price nevertheless norris has banished the word problem from 
his vocabulary substituting opportunity 
we have plenty of opportunities absolutely he says with the 
kind of overly cheerful tone used only by a dentist or a man who 
dismantles banks for a living 
commonwealths contribution to the real estate mess is about 670 
million in repossessed property while norris has none of the 
outoftheordinary repossessions that grab headlines what he does 
have amply illustrates the opportunities ahead for the rtc 
heres a sampling 
two singlefamily homes in a prosperous northwestern houston 
neighborhood tract mansions they were built on speculation and 
repossessed still unfinished after the developer couldnt make the 
payments on a 794000 loan 
in one swarms of mosquitoes stream through broken windows and 
buzz over the glassstrewn floors of what would have been an elegant 
living room with a stone fireplace and cathedral ceiling in the 
other an empty beer can candle drippings and graffiti led 
zeppelin rules show that local youths have made a hangout of 
what would have been a luxury kitchen encircled by maplestained 
cabinets at most the homes are now worth 100000 each 
a shopping strip not far from houstons posh galleria mall cars 
cluster in one end of the parking lot around an eighttheater 
cinema at the other end diners stroll from a cafeteria between 
the two stand empty stores a long expanse of concrete and blank 
glass the strip is probably worth less than half of commonwealths 
15 million loan 
a vacant lot just off houstons busy southwest freeway a 
developer borrowed 14 million hoping to build an office tower on 
the spot but the deal fell through 
all three properties are far from ready for sale the wouldbe 
luxury homes for instance have deteriorated so sharply that it 
could cost more to make them habitable and attractive than it would 
to buy similar homes in good shape 
the shopping center encroaches on an adjoining property and the 
government will have to pay lawyers to clear up the title problem 
before sale 
parcels have been carved from the vacant lot for a gas station 
and a drivein bank leaving an irregularly shaped piece of land 
scarcely suitable for an office building even if there were demand 
for more office space in houston which there is not 
multiply commonwealths problems 30fold to get an idea of the 
magnitude of the sampl mess in houston multiply commonwealth 700fold 
to get an appreciation of the problem nationally

a skeleton of what will be the worlds 
tallest wooden roller coaster already rises above the trees at six 
flags over texas and planners are concocting other gutwrenching 
thrills 
walt disney co has splurged on a fantasyland of hollywood 
diversions and acquired rights to many of the muppets who will 
cavort with mickey and goofy at disney theme parks 
bidders seeking sea world may pay more than 1 billion for shamu 
the killer whale and other finned celebrities 
all this maneuvering reflects one common handicap in the 4 
billion amusementpark business mother nature still calls most of 
the shots in a relatively short season that winds down after labor 
day so the search for new diversions never ends 
this summer rain and heat kept many fun parks waiting for the 
crowds although others reported a late surge to surpass yearago 
levels 
especially hard hit were the 200 or so water parks a fairly new 
entrant into the amusement game 
our june was just horrendous said john seeker spokesman for 
wet n wild a water park across the freeway from six flags in 
arlington its almost like summer never came 
others had a better time of it 
we had one weekend in august which is traditionally one of our 
biggest months where we almost didnt even open but despite all 
that were well ahead of last year said ed carroll general 
manager at riverside park in agawam mass which added six new 
water rides this year 
crystal beach was not so lucky the 101yearold park in fort 
erie ontario canada just across the bridge from buffalo ny 
said it will close down its rides after this season reflecting 
increased competition and dwindling crowds 
this year we just took a nose dive said president joseph 
biondolillo a lot of it was due to the rainy spring then we 
started to lose numbers during the good weather 
last year the nations 600 amusement parks reported more than 
249 million visitors and operators surveyed in july said they 
expected about a 2 percent increase this year taking the early 
season weather problems into account 
but prices may also be holding back attendance 
admission to 27yearold six flags over texas is 1995 on the 
high end of prices among regional parks 
its a little steep especially when all four of us come 
said jackie corley who was visiting the park on a recent 
100degree day 
wed think twice about coming back if the price were 
increased she said 
even next years scheduled debut of the 5 million texas giant a 
4920foot long wooden roller coaster might not be enough to 
overcome the price she said 
daughter elisa however had a different view she likes the park 
because i can have fun 
roller coasters are a big draw at the larger parks and are 
frequently the main attractions 
worlds of fun in kansas city for example has a muchballyhooed 
new coaster this year the 3 million timberwolf and attendance is 
up 10 percent park officials said 
the coaster recently was rated no 2 in the nation in a survey by 
inside track a publication for roller coaster enthusiasts 
we just had to come to see it said sara johnson of topeka 
kan at worlds of fun on a recent weekend with family members 
she and family said the park was expensive but they regarded it 
as a special onceasummer outing and were willing to pay 
in houston at six flagsowned astroworld the viper coaster also 
helped the park overcome early season doldrums brought on by 
tropical storm allison and hurricane chantal 
there will be a new ride at astroworld next year as well but 
spokeswoman debra ford wouldnt reveal the nature of the attraction 
except to say its going to be a great thrill ride 
the newest generation of thrills involves motion simulation 
rides that give passengers the feel of hurtling through space or 
under water or flying an airplane they can cost from 120000 to 
2 million each depending on the sophistication 
the smaller scale of the motion simulators they dont require 
towering support structures reflect a trend toward downsizing and 
regionalization 
were close to saturation theres no major metropolitan area 
in the united states that doesnt have a park within easy driving 
distance said peter irish an official with the international 
association of amusement parks and attractions an industry group in 
alexandria va 
as a result iaapa trade shows include seminars on miniature 
golf gocart tracks batting cages and arcades irish said 
parks also are turning to concerts and other entertainment to 
draw people during slack times an iaapa survey this summer showed 
more than 30 percent of the projects planned for the largest parks 
were for entertainment 
the parks are hoping to attract more customers like paul and 
paula jarvis of bowie md who visited williamsburg vas busch 
gardens along with their grandchildren 
we like the shows mrs jarvis said we really dont go for 
the rides too much 
regional does not mean less lucrative harcourt brace jovanovich 
inc is selling off its parks four sea worlds plus other smaller 
parks near its orlando headquarters and it is estimated the deal 
could bring the publisher 15 billion 23 times what hbj paid for 
the three sea worlds it bought in 1976 
bigger is still better as far as players like disney are 
concerned however 
with this years addition of the new disneymgm studios theme 
park in florida and the announced purchase of rights to the muppet 
characters this past week disneys pursuit of new attractions has 
reached barnumesque proportions 
the disneymgm theme park is a 400 million playground with 
diversions that range from doityourself music videos to 
recreations of 1940s hollywood boulevard 
the public response to the new disneymgm studios theme park 
has been overwhelming beyond our wildest dreams it has led to our 
decision to expand the park doubling it in size in the next two 
years spokesman john dreyer said 
the company refuses to disclose attendance figures but one 
analyst estimates as many as 150000 a day pass through the disney 
gates in florida paying 100 for a fourday ticket 
its size and variety make a disney a destination park in the 
lingo of the amusement business it also profits from nearby 
attractions that have sprung up in its shadow and feed off its 
success the orlando area is home to sea world boardwalk and 
baseball cypress gardens and busch gardens nearby in tampa in 
addition mca inc is investing 600 million in a universal studio 
park near orlando to compete with disney

a group of franchisees operating more than 500 
arbys fastfood restaurants said wednesday it had offered over 200 
million for the chain but the owner says its not interested in 
selling 
arbys inc is owned by a company controlled by dwg corp a 
miamibased holding company controlled by industrialist victor 
posner 
the group of eight franchisees said it wanted to buy the 
atlantabased chain because dwgs continued ownership could threaten 
the stability of arbys partly because of posners legal and 
financial problems 
we believe strongly that arbys inc should be owned by its 
franchisees the group incorporated as rb partners ltd said 
in a letter tuesday to fellow franchisees 
we are not trying to profit from taking the lead here said 
the letter released wednesday we are trying to protect the 
arbys system 
posner pleaded no contest in 1987 to federal income tax evasion 
and was sentenced last year to five years probation on the condition 
that he pay all his back taxes penalties and interest the cost of 
prosecuting his case and create a 3 million fund to benefit the 
homeless 
we think it is very unlikely that arbys could remain 
unaffected by all these pressures on mr posner and dwg read the 
franchisees letter 
arbys is a wholly owned subsidiary of miami beachbased 
chesapeake financial corp of which dwg is a 60 percent owner 
chesapeake in a statement released wednesday termed the rb 
partners proposal an unsolicited purported offer chesapeake 
also said as it had previously informed such franchisees it 
presently had no interest in pursuing such a sale 
posner who is chairman of arbys inc is committed to the 
continued growth and expansion of arbys a process which under 
his management had resulted in outstanding performance and growth 
since its acquisition in june 1984 chesapeake stated 
officials at arbys headquarters in atlanta could not be reached 
for comment wednesday a secretary said president and chief 
executive officer leonard h roberts was in a meeting 
the franchisees said their offer represents three times what dwg 
paid for the chain in 1984 as part of its acquisition of royal crown 
cola companies arbys with about 2100 restaurants reported total 
revenue of 1538 million and an operating profit of 207 million 
in 1988 
a spokesman for the franchisees who asked that his name not be 
used said wednesday the group wass confident it could raise the 
money for the deal and had been assured by a number of institutions 
that it could get financing 
howard hansen a restaurant industry analyst with kidder peabody 
in new york said there have been some cases of successful 
franchisee buyouts but he said the main obstacle for the group 
would be raising the money 
i dont believe there would be any legal hurdles you have to 
come up with the money hansen said

kohlberg kravis roberts amp co its image one of 
confidence and strength stormed to the top of the takeover business 
by accomplishing billiondollar leveraged buyouts including the 
biggest corporate acquisition of all time 
but a lawsuit filed tuesday by jerome kohlberg jr one of the 
firms founders shows the dissension among the ranks of kohlberg 
kravis partners and adds to the firms growing problems four months 
after it completed its record 2453 billion buyout of rjr nabisco 
inc 
in the suit filed in state supreme court in manhattan kohlberg 
alleged the firm reduced his stake in several companies that were 
acquired while he was one of kkrs general partners kohlberg claims 
that violated an agreement he made with the firm when he left its 
management in 1987 
the suit names as defendants kohlberg kravis its kkr associates 
arm and the firms two other founders henry r kravis and george r 
roberts 
kohlberg alleged the defendants determined to secure and 
transfer a portion of kohlbergs interests with respect to these 
companies to themselves or other kkr personnel andor persons or 
entities which they chose 
the firm denied kohlbergs allegations in a statement 
we are saddened that mr kohlberg felt it necessary to sue his 
partners and kkr we belive he is wrong both as to the facts and 
his interpretation of the agreement between us and we fully expect 
to prevail in court 
the suit comes as kohlberg kravis a superstar in mergers and 
acquisitions and the leader among leveraged buyout firms has run 
into difficulties with some of its properties 
leveraged buyouts are deals financed mainly with borrowed money 
that is repaid with the acquired companys cash flow or the sale of 
its assets 
the firm whose operations long have been a mystery to the 
public reportedly has had trouble selling some of its businesses 
and several others either are foundering or have been disappointing 
investments 
for example new yorkbased seamans furniture co which went 
private in a 360 million kohlberg kravisengineered lbo two years 
ago has said it must renegotiate debt payments partly because 
sales growth has not met expectations 
kohlberg kravis and roberts formed their partnership in 1976 
with each of the three serving as general partners who managed the 
firm and directed its acquisitions and investments 
kohlberg remained a general partner until 1987 when after a 
fallingout with kravis and roberts over the firms strategy he 
became a limited partner sharing in kohlberg kravis profits but 
not in its management 
among the deals undertaken while kohlberg was a general partner 
were the 1986 lbos of consumer products giant beatrice cos for 61 
billion and the grocery chain safeway stores inc for 42 billion 
kohlberg claims that under his 1987 agreement with the firm he 
was supposed to maintain his previously allocated stakes in 
companies that kkr acquired while he was still a general partner in 
several cases his interest has been reduced his suit alleged 
the suit involves kohlbergs investment in several kohlberg 
kravis properties 
marley co acquired in a 1981 lbo the company manufactures 
heat exchange and fluid handling equipment such as boilers and 
cooling towers 
houdaille industries inc an industrial products manufacturer 
acquired in a 1979 lbo 
idex corp formed last year as a holding company for six 
houdaille subsidiaries 
pacific realty associates a real estate investment partnership 
acquired in a 1983 lbo 
mampt inc acquired in a 1985 lbo another real estate concern 
pactrust realty inc formed in 1988 as a holding company for 
mampt and pacific realty 
for example the complaint said kohlberg kravis decided in june 
1988 to recapitalize marley through the redemption of debt and the 
purchase of equity interests in marley of limited partners and other 
investors 
the recapitalization was accomplished through loans from 
financial institutions and the investment of additional capital by 
kohlberg kravis partners and other investors the complaint read 
in this connection kkr has informed kohlberg that his interest 
in kkrs investment in the marley leveraged buyout transaction made 
in 1981 would be reduced from 32 percent to 17625 percent or by 
almost onehalf in violation of the 1987 agreement the complaint 
said 
the complaintdemanded that kohlberg kravis restore to kohlberg 
the interest in the companies as provided for in the 1987 agreement 
and that the court prohibit the defendants from reducing kohlbergs 
stake in other companies in violation of the agreement 
kkrs other general partners robert macdonnell paul raether and 
michael michelson were not named as defendants in the suit 
kohlberg kravis limited partners include its investors among 
them corporate and state pension funds these investors who also 
were not named in kohlbergs suit help supply the equity for 
buyouts undertaken by the firm

kellogg co trying to take advantage of 
consumers increasing concerns about health on wednesday entered 
the growing market for foods that purportedly lower cholesterol 
kellogg at a news conference unveiled a new cereal heartwise 
which contains oat bran and psyllium the two grains are high in 
soluble fiber which is believed to help the body rid itself of 
cholesterol 
high levels of cholesterol have been shown to increase the risk 
of heart disease 
in introducing its new product which is expected to reach stores 
in the fall kellogg is challenging one of its biggest competitors 
general mills inc whose benefit cereal contains the same 
ingredients 
kellogg said it would spend 40 million in the first year to 
advertise and promote the new cereal it will be marketed nationwide 
a variety of oat bran products have exploded onto the market 
since researchers said the grain could help reduce cholesterol 
levels but psyllium a grain grown mainly in india is a relative 
newcomer in terms of foods connected with healthy hearts although 
it has been used for years in laxatives such as procter amp gamble 
cos metamucil 
the outer husk of psyllium contains soluble fiber that has been 
shown to reduce cholesterol the cereal makers claim 
general mills promotion of benefit has been challenged by 
procter amp gamble which was ordered by the food and drug 
administration to refrain from advertising health claims for 
metamucil procter amp gamble contends psyllium is a drug and should 
be regulated by the fda 
however the fda instead of declaring psyllium a drug and 
thereby forcing companies to undergo lengthy approval procedures 
is developing a regulation governing health claims on product labels 
including foods such as cereal 
other cereals made by kellogg based in battle creek mich 
include corn flakes and rice krispies 
heartwise will be targeted to consumers age 35 and older but 
kellogg is planning an advertising campaign that promotes the 
cereals benefits for children as well as adults

copper futures prices rebounded wednesday on news of a strike 
vote by workers at a chilean copper corp mine but gains were 
tempered by reports that labor troubles elsewhere may be easing 
on other futures markets frozen pork belly prices remained 
strong cattle and hog prices were mostly lower wheat futures fell 
corn and soybeans were mixed precious metals declined and oil 
futures rallied 
in trading at the new york commodity exchange copper settled 1 
cent to 185 cents higher with the contract for delivery in 
september at 129 a pound 
the markets strong tone came from reports that workers at 
chilean coppers el salvador mine voted to strike on sept 1 said 
stephen platt a metals analyst with dean witter reynolds inc in 
chicago 
although labor and management were continuing to talk after 
tuesdays vote copper prices closed firm over that strike 
uncertainty platt said 
still the market failed to regain the strength it had shown 
before tuesdays collapse when prices settled at least 7 cents 
lower the settlement price wednesday of the september contract was 
just a penny higher than tuesdays 
weakness stems from a feeling among traders that settlements may 
be near in walkouts at highland valley copper cos highland valley 
mine in british columbia and in peru 
most people are feeling that the supply thinness emanating from 
the special situations is easing platt said 
gold and silver prices declined in mostly featureless trading at 
the new york commodity exchange 
pressure on both metals came from the strength of the dollar 
analysts said gold selling also was encouraged by concerns that 
tuesdays gains were somewhat overdone platt said 
gold prices settled 150 to 180 lower with the contract for 
delivery in september at 36180 a troy ounce silver settled 8 
cent to 1 cent lower with the september contract at 5085 a troy 
ounce 
pork belly prices held strong in trading at the chicago 
mercantile exchange where cattle and hog futures were mostly lower 
the bellies strength was tied to rumors of possible export sales 
of us pork to poland while gains were tempered by a lack of 
strong market fundamentals 
supplies remain abundant and theres been no sign that lobbying 
by pork producers has persuaded the bush administration to include 
pork in in whatever charity package were going to be sending to 
poland said phillip stanley a livestock consultant in chicago 
with dec futures inc 
we bought the rumor we havent necessarily sold the fact 
he said the market wants to see something in writing the ball 
definitely rests in the adminstrations hands 
live cattle settled 20 cent to 105 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in september at 7250 cents a pound feeder

services 30day forecast does not include a chance for an early 
frost and calls instead for nrmal rain and temperatures in the 
midwest 
in addition more rain is expected to move into the midwest by 
the end of the week adding further downward pressure to prices

americans personal incomes rose a brisk 07 
percent in july while consumer spending climbed at the fastest rate 
since april the government said wednesday in a report providing 
more good news about the countrys economic prospects 
the commerce department said the rise in incomes fueled by rapid 
growth in wages and salaries was the biggest monthly gain since a 1 
percent increase in march 
the department said that consumer spending also posted a 07 
percent increase last month the fastest advance since a 12 percent 
rise in april 
the government also made significant revisions to previous months 
showing that income growth and consumer spending were not as 
sluggish as previously believed 
private economists said the combination of the strong july 
increases and the upward revisions in earlier months showed that the 
current economic expansion which this month became the second 
longest in us history was picking up steam 
just a month ago there were widespread fears that just the 
reverse was occurring with many analysts predicting on the basis 
of weak reports that the country was in danger of toppling into a 
recession 
the economy was not nearly as weak in the spring said bruce 
steinberg senior economist at the new york brokerage firm of 
merrill lynch the image of an economy on the verge of a recession 
has been changed by these revisions 
the government on tuesday significantly revised upward its 
estimate of total economic growth putting the increase in the gross 
national product from april through june at a healthy 27 percent 
annual rate instead of the anemic 17 percent rate reported a month 
ago 
most of the upward revision in gnp growth came from a doubling of 
the estimate of how much consumers spent during the apriljune 
quarter 
wednesdays report showed that consumer spending was even 
stronger in july primarily because of a surge in sales of autos 
spurred by incentive sales programs aimed at reducing a high 
inventory of unsold cars 
with car sales remaining strong in august analysts looked for 
total consumer spending this quarter to surpass the second quarter 
pace since consumer spending accounts for twothirds of total 
economic activity that would be good news for the economy 
steinberg cautioned however that the steep discounting to 
reduce car inventories and buyer concerns about announced price 
hikes on the 1990 models would very likely translate into lackluster 
car sales in the final three months of the year and depress consumer 
spending during that quarter 
but sandra shaber an economist with the futures group a 
washington consulting firm said that she expected other areas such 
as sales of clothing and consumer electronics and more travel 
spending to take up the slack from an expected drop in car sales 
we have had some startling revisions in the economic data which 
have chased away the recession fears and put a whole different look 
on the strength of the marketplace she said consumer spending 
was twice as strong as we earlier thought and that strength seems to 
be continuing 
the bush administration is predicting that the economy should 
grow this year by a healthy 29 percent a rate that private 
economists are now agreeing is well within reach 
the current recovery from the 198182 recession which is already 
the longest peacetime expansion in us history entered its 81st 
month in august surpassing the 80monthlong recovery from june 
1938 to february 1945 which occurred during world war ii the 
recovery period actually began in july 1938 
the only longer expansion in us history is the 106monthlong 
recovery from february 1961 to december 1969 which occurred during 
the vietnam war 
the 07 percent rise in consumer spending in july followed a much 
weaker 02 percent june increase the 07 percent income rise 
followed a 05 percent june increase 
the july report showed that americans income after taxes also 
rose 07 percent in july down slightly from a 08 percent aftertax 
increase in june 
with incomes growing at the same rate as spending in july 
americans savings rate savings as a percent of disposable income 
held steady at 57 percent this matched the june level and was the 
highest level for savings since a 62 percent rate in march 
the key component of the income category wages and salaries 
increased by 254 billion in july up substantially from a 176 
billion june increase reflecting widespread gains in all employment 
categories 
on the spending side the 254 billion rise in personal 
consumption spending followed a a 66 billion june advance 
purchases of durable goods items such as cars which are expected to 
last three or more years jumped 76 billion up from a 26 
billion june increase 
overall personal consumption spending which includes everything 
except interest payments on debt came in at an annual rate of 348 
trillion in july personal incomes totaled 450 trillion at an 
annual rate in july

the philadelphia stock exchange facing a ban 
on stock basket trading announced wednesday it filed documents 
to clarify that the investments are securities not futures 
contracts 
the amended proposal filed with the securities and exchange 
commission was in response to an aug 18 decision by the 7th us 
circuit court of appeals in chicago which halted trading in stock 
baskets investments based on the value of broad market indexes 
the court said the sec erred last may in approving stock baskets 
also known as cash index participation shares because they do not 
fall under the secs jurisdiction the court classified the 
investments not as stocks but as futures contracts which fall under 
the jurisdiction of the commodity futures trading commission 
in addition to the philadelphia exchange the american stock 
exchange and the chicago board of options exchange have traded stock 
baskets for several months 
according to a news release from the philadelphia exchange the 
new filing contains proposals that will allow investors who buy or 
sell stock baskets to sell their shares at any time without any 
penalty 
previously investors were charged a penalty unless the sales 
came at the end of a quarter 
also under the new filing those investors selling the 
instruments will receive a price that reflects the value of the 
underlying stocks at the opening of the market that day rather than 
at the previous days close 
these changes are in line with the ruling of the 7th circuit 
court and should remove once and for all the obstacles that stand 
before us said nicholas a giordano the exchanges president 
the philadelphia exchange first sought sec approval for stock 
baskets in march 1988 
baskets are priced to reflect changes in indexes such as the 
standard amp poors 500stock index and the dow jones average of 30 
industrial stocks investors receive quarterly cash payments equal 
to a proportionate share of any regular cash dividends declared on 
the stocks in the index

leona helmsley the persnickety hotel queen 
quoted as saying only the little people pay taxes was convicted 
wednesday of evading 12 million in income tax by charging personal 
expenses to her business empire 
the federal jury acquitted mrs helmsley 69 of the most serious 
charge against her conspiring to extort payoffs from vendors 
pictured as a regal perfectionist in ads for helmsley luxury 
hotels mrs helmsley was portrayed in court as an abusive 
pennypinching tyrant part of a defense strategy of arguing she 
was the victim of spiteful exemployees 
in opening arguments her own lawyer labeled her a tough 
bitch 
mrs helmsley shook her head while listening to the litany of 
guilty verdicts on 33 of 41 counts former aides frank turco and 
joseph licari were convicted of assisting in the taxevasion scheme 
she walked past hundreds of reporters photographers and 
bystanders on the courthouse steps got into a limousine and 
departed without comment 
of course well appeal said joseph benfante lawyer for 
licari 
mrs helmsley remains free pending sentencing nov 14 each of 
the 33 counts carries either three or five years in prison she also 
faces fines up to 8 million 
the jury found mrs helmsley evaded federal taxes from 1983 
through 1985 most of it by billing 31 million in expenses from 
the helmsleys greenwich conn mansion dunnellen hall to their 
hotel and real estate business 
among the expenses were more than 1 million for a pool enclosure 
with a marble dance floor jade figures worth 500000 a 130000 
indooroutdoor sound system similar to one mrs helmsley had admired 
at disney world and thousands of dollars in landscaping 
todays verdicts should widely serve as a reminder that no one 
regardless of how wealthy or how wellinsulated by underlings under 
the law is free to flaunt the tax laws said us attorney benito 
romano 
he said it was too early to say what sentence prosecutors would 
seek 
we gave a very fair verdict it was very hard said david 
samuel a member of the jury that deliberated for five days 
mrs helmsley and her husband harry still face prosecution on 
charges of evading state taxes no trial date has been set 
helmsley 80 heads a 5 billion empire that includes 27 hotels 
the helmsley hotels in new york city and the clevelandbased harley 
chain he was indicted with his wife in 1988 but was found mentally 
incompetent to stand trial 
in addition to expenses at dunnellen hall prosecutors alleged 
that 320172 in mrs helmsleys personal purchases including 
thousands of dollars in designer clothing were charged to the park 
lane hotel in new york 
another item was a 45000 silver clock in the shape of the 
helmsley building a birthday present to harry helmsley from his 
wife 
his wifes image took a beating at the trial already described 
as a finicky queen in helmsley ads she was depicted as arrogant 
and meanspirited 
her former housekeeper testified that mrs helmsley once told 
her we dont pay taxes only the little people pay taxes 
many of the 44 prosecution witnesses during the eightweek trial 
described how she fired employees at the slightest provocation and 
disputed bills 
defense attorney gerald feffer sought to discredit the witnesses 
as disgruntled exemployees 
he also noted the helmsleys paid 578 million in taxes during 
the time covered by the indictment and argued the couple did nothing 
wrong in billing dunnellen hall expenses to their business because 
they used the estate for business

one of two japanese banks planning a major merger 
admitted wednesday it had urged its clients to buy stock in the bank 
in june but said this had no connection with the merger talks then 
under way 
it was intended to increase the number of stable shareholders 
of the banks stock said fukio yamamoto a spokesman for taiyo 
kobe bank 
mitsui bank the seventhlargest bank in both japan and the 
world and taiyo kobe the eighthlargest announced tuesday they 
will merge april 1 to meet intensifying competition from domestic 
and foreign banks the new bank will be the worlds second largest 
wednesdays disclosure triggered criticism that taiyo kobe bank 
was using insider information for its own advantage but yamamoto 
said the stock campaign had no connection with the merger talks 
taiyo kobe has been seen as the main beneficiary of the merger in 
terms of its stock price taiyo kobe stock had been steady at the 
equivalent of about 980 a share until late june when it began 
rising it closed at 1140 monday the day before the merger was 
announced 
trading in both banks stock was suspended tuesday to give 
investors time to digest details of the merger plan 
on wednesday buy orders in anticipation of further rises in 
taiyo kobes stock amounted to 64 million shares while 450000 
shares were offered for sale 
the stock closed wednesday at 1350 after the maximum oneday 
gain of 210 allowed under stock exchange rules 
officials of the tokyo stock exchange said they would investigate 
the merger but stressed that it would be a routine probe not 
based on any suspicion that insider trading or illegality was 
involved 
hitoshi shimakura head of the transaction inspection division of 
the worlds largest exchange said his office would look into recent 
price fluctuations of both banks stocks 
the real key is when the actual decision on the merger was 
made he said as far as insider trading laws are concerned 
anything that occurred before the final decision to merge has to be 
handled separately 
kenichi suematsu president of mitsui bank told reporters at a 
news conference tuesday that the merger was formally approved by the 
boards of directors of both banks on monday he said negotiations 
for the merger began in march 
on wednesday it was learned from a report compiled by the 
securities industries association that shinei ishino securities co 
a brokerage affiliated with taiyo kobe bank bought 47 million 
taiyo kobe shares in june and july when merger negotiations were in 
their final stage 
analysts said the huge purchase of taiyo kobe shares by 
mediumsize shinei ishino was caused by the banks campaign to urge 
its clients to buy shares taiyo kobe officials said they usually 
recommend that their clients use shinei ishino 
junzo yamakawa a vice president of shinei ishino was quoted in 
the nihon keizai shimbun a major economic newspaper as saying his 
company knew nothing about the merger before the announcement and 
it was entirely our customers decision to buy taiyo kobe shares 
there had been speculation that taiyo kobe was about to 
announce an important decision because its share prices began 
soaring while most other bank shares remained sluggish said 
keiichi nishida an analyst at kidder peabody securities whats 
clear now is that the information did leak out and apparently 
affected its stock price well ahead of the announcement of the 
merger

eastern airlines nearing the seventh month of its 
strike on wednesday said it will add another 101 daily flights oct 
1 and is ahead of its rebuilding schedule 
the announcement of new flights most between florida and 
northeast cities came a day before eastern officials were scheduled 
to make a presentation in new york to creditors on their rebuilding 
plan while eastern says its making good progress on efforts to 
rebuild without its unions the wall street journal reported 
wednesday that eastern faces 400 million in revenue shortfalls and 
may have to revise its plan for emerging from chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection 
we do have a meeting with the creditors and well give them an 
overall status report said eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak 
she declined to comment further but said one thing that hasnt 
changed is that the creditors will all be paid 
the journal quoting unidentified sources said parent texas air 
corp may underwrite some of easterns operations because easterns 
negotiations with rival american airlines on the sale of latin 
american routes have stalled the sale had been expected to bring in 
as much as 400 million for miamibased eastern 
eastern president phil bakes said recently the carrier may not 
sell the full 18 billion in assets envisaged in its original 
rebuilding plan and he said the coveted latin american routes 
wouldnt necessarily be sold 
while bakes said eastern intends to be bigger than first planned 
union officials say the effort to rebuild since the strike began 
march 4 is foundering 
obviously this is a setback for texas air chairman frank 
lorenzo and the creditors pilots union spokesman hank weber said 
to say hes 20 to 25 percent short on his cash projections has to 
have an unfavorable response from the creditors 
referring to easterns planned schedule increase weber said i 
dont know where they will get the aircraft 
he said eastern whose pilots machinists and flight attendants 
unions remain on strike and hope for a new owner is falling behind 
on aircraft maintenance 
weber said the pilots union is exploring bringing more pressure 
on lorenzo by threatening to remove 800 million in pension fund 
investments from banks doing business with texas air he said 
details were still being worked out for the effort which the pilots 
union hopes will be joined by other unions 
george brennan easterns vice president for marketing said the 
carrier has sufficient numbers of pilots and planes to boost its 
schedule again eastern earlier announced it will move from 390 
daily flights to 601 on sept 7 and brennan said it will jump to 
702 on oct 1 
there will be several more additions in the month after that 
brennan said putting eastern near its target 800 daily flights by 
years end 
what this says is were going to get the airline rebuilt faster 
than we thought brennan said 
eastern had nearly 1100 daily flights and 30000 employees when 
it was struck last spring the company is now back to 12000 
employees and will have 17000 by years end brennan said 
eastern which is leasing 15 planes and crews from texas air 
sister continental airlines doesnt plan to lease more from 
continental brennan said he said eastern has 155 planes of its own 
to fly 
the carrier is continuing to offer discount fares such as 79 one 
way between miami and new york brennan said although eastern loses 
money flying passengers at such low prices he said the priority 
this year is winning back customers to the rebuilding carrier 
ultimately of course weve got to prove we can be 
profitable brennan said 
the new schedule increases adding new nonstop services from 
miami washington philadelphia boston and new york move eastern 
close to its goal of nearly 300 flights for its atlanta hub while 
moving the rebuilding focus to its traditional stronghold in 
florida brennan said

oilman and corporate raider t boone pickens said 
wednesday he will not run for governor in 1990 but left open his 
options for 1994 
the 61yearold pickens said the crush of his business would not 
allow him to commit 100 percent of his time to the needs of the 
state 
its not the time he told about 500 people at a dallas 
rotary luncheon ending weeks of speculation 
pickens said he had prepared two versions of his speech one 
announcing his candidacy and the one he delivered he and his wife 
beatrice reached their decision late tuesday at their hotel room in 
dallas pickens said and were still discussing it wednesday morning 
pickens did not rule out a run in 1994 thats an option he 
said 
pickens would not endorse any of the republican candidates who 
would have been his rivals in the gop primary 
his decision not to run pickens said was based on his 
involvement in his mesa limited partnership koito manufacturing and 
his united shareholders association 
mesa an oil and gas firm lost 134 million in the second 
quarter and will likely post a loss in the third quarter pickens 
said refusing to speculate on how large the loss might be 
he blamed the losses on declining natural gas prices pickens 
once feared as a corporate raider and who made a 518 million pretax 
profit in a 1983 attempted takeover of gulf oil corp said it was 
the first loss for the company in 16 years 
pickens also said he plans to continue his efforts to open up 
opportunities for us investment in japan and may 
significantly increase his stake in koito manufacturing a 
japanese auto parts supplier 
pickens boone co owns 202 percent of koito although pickens 
is koitos largest shareholder he has been denied a seat on the 
companys board 
he said he plans to call for a special koito shareholders meeting 
in coming weeks and will continue to work with congress and us 
trade officials to level the playing field in trade and 
investment with the japanese i think the japanese are just not 
playing a fair game he said
