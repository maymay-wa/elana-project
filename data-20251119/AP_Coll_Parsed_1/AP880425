three tobacco companies in a cigarette 
liability suit will ask again for a mistrial following a judges 
opinion that narrowed the claims against them lawyers said monday 
lawyers for philip morris co liggett group inc and lorillard 
inc will file papers this week for a mistrial in us district 
judge h lee sarokins ruling last thursday said steven c 
parrish a lawyer for morris and lorillard 
the companies have sought at least four mistrials since court 
proceedings began feb 1 and twice have sought to have sarokin 
removed from the case all those efforts were unsuccessful 
sarokin last week dismissed charges brought by antonio cipollone 
on behalf of his wife rose who died of lung cancer at age 58 in 
1984 after four decades of smoking the defendants cigarettes 
cipollone had charged that the companies caused his wifes death by 
failing to market a safer product or do enough research on smoking 
although the judge ruled there was not enough evidence to 
support the claims he decided that the evidence could lead to a 
finding that the companies engaged in conspiracy to cover up the 
dangers of smoking 
the companies say the jury could not decide fairly on the 
remaining contentions because so much evidence on the safer 
cigarette and research issues has been introduced 
sarokin also let stand allegations that liggett failed to warn 
mrs cipollone about the dangers of cigarettes but threw out the 
charge against morris and lorillard because she did not smoke their 
cigarettes after 1966 when congress mandated warnings on cigarette 
packs

minister benedicto meneses said only 600 workers have walked off 
their jobs 
monday night the labor ministry said negotiations with the 
strikers had been suspended a statement said the unions were 
seeking to return to former payment systems that were eliminated

a lawyer for rock singer mick jagger 
said monday that there was only the barest scintilla of 
evidence that jagger ever heard a song he is accused of pirating 
in his 1985 hit just another night 
a federal court jury got the case monday and deliberated 3 
hours before retiring for the evening 
the jury listened to several tapes and reviewed jaggers travel 
schedule for early 1983 when reggae musician patrick alleys song 
was broadcast in the new york area testimony showed jagger was in 
the area for five days in january and february of that year 
alley is suing jagger maintaining that jagger infringed on his 
copyright of a song with the same name 
two alternate jurors who were dismissed at start of 
deliberations said it seemed to them that jagger had developed his 
song independently 
peter parcher one of jaggers lawyers said the only similarity 
between jaggers song and alleys 1979 song were the title and the 
theme of a man spending one more night with a woman which is 
certainly not original 
parcher said there was only the barest barest scintilla of 
evidence that jagger ever heard alleys song and added that his 
client had no motive to steal patrick alleys song 
alleys attorney thomas farley said alley and jagger had 
several mutual friends and acquaintances and said the songs 
similar choruses were the certain spark that made the songs 
memorable 
if the jury decides jagger infringed upon alleys copyright 
damages would be decided in a second trial unless a settlement were 
reached 
alleys lawyers say jagger netted as much as 6 million from the 
song

elaines whose clubby confines have provided 
refuge for a generation of creative minds and famous faces 
celebrated its first quartercentury monday with a celebrity bash 
elaine kaufman the rotund proprietress who rewards loyalty and 
fame with choice tables expected her nice neighborhood 
restaurant to be filled with people whose names have filled 
gossip columns for years 
for the party the checkedclothcovered tables were removed 
the ceiling was filled with balloons and rotating spotlights were 
set up outside 
a crowd of onlookers watched as celebrities filed by george 
segal sidney lumet pat kennedy lawford peter maas eli wallach 
iman connie chung raquel welch billy dee williams cheryl tiegs 
halston terry southern jerzy kosinski 
the eighth avenue subway at rush hour is a picnic compared to 
this said jackie mason in the jampacked interior 
these people are used to being treated like kings here 
tonight they are treated like cockroaches 
and this was early by elaines standards 10 pm 
this place is a living people magazine said bartender brian 
mcdonald 
but a glitzy night of revelry is hardly what the regulars think 
of when they think of elaines 
a comfortable tavern chockablock with posters photos and book 
covers donated by its celebrated clientele elaines has evolved 
from a writers and artists hangout to a required stop in the 
citys seeandbeseen circuit 
saturday night was typical woody allen albert finney and 
paloma picasso among others prince was there a couple of weeks 
ago 
allen opened his cinematic valentine to new york manhattan 
with a scene set in elaines hes a regular elaine said because 
he loves to peoplewatch its comfortable nobody bothers him 
we make him what he wants 
the food critics love to point out is undistinguished its 
the restaurant where you get the least for your money 
according to the zagat restaurant survey 
and its reputation deserved or not is that service can be rude 
and inattentive if youve never made the bestseller list even 
writer george plimpton among the most loyal of regulars said 
im afraid you dont get treated very well if you dont have a 
pencil in your top pocket 
nevertheless it usually fills up by 9 pm with stars 
stargazers yuppies and just neighborhood folks those at the bar 
can nurse 350 beers and watch the scene 
in a city where formality sometimes chokes the fun out of a 
meal elaines is a relaxing familiar retreat its regulars say 
it offers an ambience of camaraderie that is centered on 
elaine herself shes the den mother there said author gay 
talese adding its like a boarding house youve got the round 
table and you dont need a reservation if youre a friend of 
hers 
if youre not youll sit farther back 
detractors and celebritywatchers alike make too big a deal out 
of the place elaine said 
i think a lot of people just come in to have dinner she 
said and you have a good time a good bottle of wine a nice 
plate of pasta i mean thats life 
when she plunked down 10000 for the bar in 1963 she already 
knew some show folk writers and artists from her days as a 
waitress and cafe manager in greenwich village 
actually what i did was just bring the village uptown she 
said 
then it was barely going a rather sleepy place up there 
plimpton recalled friends got their friends to go it was just 
one room very quiet and we would play darts 
elaine made sure it was a very informal nonfrantic 
atmosphere now its a bit different and more expensive 
overall however its much the same as it was 25 years ago 
said elaine regulars can count on a good table and count on her 
being there 
im not changing it all the time she said im not going 
with the current trend

a group of panamanian dissidents is planning 
to undertake a military operation against strongman manuel antonio 
noriega by the beginning of next week an opposition leader said 
monday 
ambassador juan b sosa who has maintained his loyalty to 
ousted president eric arturo delvalle told reporters the group is 
made up of very knowledgeable officers who have many friends in the 
panamanian defense forces or pdf 
sosa gave no details but the group apparently is comprised of 
highranking defectors from the defense forces who came to the 
united states shortly after panamas crisis erupted two months ago 
with delvalles ouster 
one is air force lt col augusto villalaz who has been living 
in exile in washington for the past five weeks he claimed that he 
and other defense force pilots flew more than 90000 pounds of 
weapons from cuba to panama before he defected 
sosa who has refused to relinquish the embassy to a replacement 
envoy appointed by the new government in panama said the dissident 
group has set up a military command and has intimate 
knowledge of the defense forces 
we are very confident that the military actions will have the 
help the support of people within the pdf sosa said this is 
an asset we never had before 
a military coup attempt against noriega last month was put down 
quickly 
asked why he was disclosing a planned military operation at a 
news conference sosa said noriega is aware that his opponents will 
not give up the struggle against him he indicated that he did not 
believe that the disclosure would hurt the chances for the success 
of the plan 
sosa said the plan is being worked out on the assumption that no 
assistance from the united states or other outside countries will 
be necessary 
us officials have said for weeks that opposition to noriega in 
the defense forces has been growing but that the dissident elements 
have been unable to agree on a plan for his ouster 
the reagan administration has imposed a series of economic and 
diplomatic sanctions against panama over the past two months and 
officials have become increasingly frustrated over noriegas 
ability to survive these pressures 
the new york times quoted an unidentified reagan administration 
official as saying that us economic sanctions against panama 
would be relaxed within a week or so 
the official said the treasury department was considering a list 
of possible exemptions including payment of utility bills and 
normal administrative fees and costs such as gasoline excise 
taxes rental fees and airline landing fees the times reported in 
its tuesday editions 
noriega is under indictment in the united states on drug 
smuggling charges 
some in the administration favor a us military move against 
panama but several proposals which have been passed on to the 
pentagon have been given a hostile reception 
sosa said that among the seven new cabinet officers appointed on 
sunday by delvalles successor president manuel solis palma were 
several with procuban leanings 
at the state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said the 
united states does not view the solis palma government as 
legitimate and she therefore declined comment on the reshuffling 
asked about the shutoff sunday of electricity to a us embassy 
annex in panama mrs oakley said the state department does not 
believe embassy operations will be affected 
the electricity to the annex and to the apartments of at least 
45 embassy workers was cut off because of nonpayment of bills 
as part of an attempt to deprive panamanian authorities of cash 
the administration has ordered a ban on all payments to the 
government by us citizens and organizations

the ficus tree long considered sterile now has a 
way to reproduce on its own and scientists in south florida are 
bracing for an explosion of the lush ironrooted titan of the 
tropics 
the ficus benjamina or weeping fig may be a finicky house 
plant but it grows very large very fast in hospitable climates 
its dense crown snuff out plants below and its notorious roots can 
muscle through pavement to strangle other large trees and choke 
pipes 
ficus had been held in check by their inability to reproduce 
until now 
tiny insects from india and tropical regions have found their 
way to florida and are allowing the trees to pollinate the wild 
seeds which are spread by birds and animals that eat the small 
berries 
a single tree can produce millions of seeds a year 
you get the idea its just a rain of these things coming down 
all the time said doyle mckey tropical biologist at the 
university of miami where ficus have been seen sprouting on stone 
walls and sidewalk cracks 
until such insects as the female fig wasp came to florida ficus 
could only be reproduced in plant nurseries from other cuttings 
that meant the spread of ficus was limited to where property owners 
planted them 
most of the wild seedlings spotted so far are small but the 
growth has been widespread they have been seen dotting lawns and 
forests throughout south florida and north to the tampa bay area 
i think were going to see our landscape change said robert 
knight jr a researcher at the us department of agricultures 
subtropical research station in coral gables 
its too soon to tell whether theyll be mostly a suburban 
nuisance or begin to crowd out native vegetation in unspoiled 
areas scientists say 
they might become a pest in our nature preserves and 
hammocks mckey said recently otherwise the habitat is going 
to be in suburbia in our landscapes where everything else is 
unnatural

president najib says his communist 
government wants better relations with the united states and would 
even consider accepting military aid from a nation now supporting 
thousands of afghan rebels 
najib also confirmed on sunday that guerrillas fighting his 
sovietbacked government had captured a garrison near the pakistan 
border after a fourmonth siege the guerrillas said the victory 
opened a new direct supply route for weapons into afghanistan 
in a speech to a visiting soviet delegation and a group of 
private american citizens najib said the united states must stop 
providing military aid to pakistan if it wants the soviet union to 
stop arming afghanistan 
najibs demand appeared more rhetorical than practical his 
armys vulnerability to attacks by pakistanibased afghan 
guerrillas would become even more pronounced if kabul lost moscows 
backing 
expounding on a formula of symmetry najib suggested soviet 
aid to his government continue at the same level as us assistance 
to pakistan 
if there must be a cutoff of aid for the afghan government 
there must be a cutoff of all american aid to the pakistani 
government najib told the two groups at the end of a weeklong 
conference on afghanistan 
the soviet union has agreed to start withdrawing its estimated 
115000 troops from afghanistan on may 15 under a unmediated 
agreement signed april 14 in geneva by the united states the 
soviet union afghanistan and pakistan 
the united states china and several other countries have been 
aiding the afghan guerrillas via pakistan the soviet union arms 
the afghan military forces each superpower has reseved the right 
to continue its assistance as long as the other one does 
throughout his address to the american and soviet delegations 
najib stressed his governments friendship with the soviet union 
which shares a 1400mile border with this central asian nation 
but he said repeatedly that his government sought friendlier 
ties and specifically private investment from the united states 
talking later with reporters he said we would like good 
relations politically economically culturally with the united 
states of america even including military aid to our country to 
defend its sovereignty and its territorial integrity 
guerrilla leaders in pakistan said saturday their fighters 
captured barikot base of the afghan armys 55th brigade on 
friday the garrison is in afghanistans northeast kunar province 
najib confirmed that government troops evacuated the garrison 
but described the incident as a hange of position rather than a 
defeat 
later sunday najib attended a ceremony marking afghanistans 
april 27 communist revolution and reiterated his call for 
reconciliation with the rebels 
now more than any other time we are hopeful for peace and 
national reconciliation he was quoted as saying by radio kabul 
for the guerrillas the capture of barikot would open a major 
weapons supply route from pakistans border town of arando to 
afghanistans northeastern province of nuristan and kunar 
the guerrillas who were not direct party to the geneva accord 
have vowed to continue fighting until najibs government is 
overthrown the soviets intervened in afghanistan in december 1979 
the afghan president whose robust fleshy build gives him the 
appearance of a football player gone slightly to seed flashed 
broad smiles and gestured expansively as he met the soviet and 
american groups for two hours at arg palace in the heart of kabul 
throughout his speech najib who replaced another sovietbacked 
afghan leader in 1986 denounced the united states for supplying 
the guerrillas with highpowered stinger missiles 
the afghan government repeatedly has accused the rebels of using 
stingers against civilian afghan aircraft 
the head of the american delegation former us ambassador to 
el salvador robert e white defended the united states 
it was not the united states that introduced hightech weapons 
into afghanistan said white who is now president of the 
nongovernment international center for development policy in 
washington 
stingers are terrible weapons but their objectives are to 
destroy machines of war that have rained death and destruction on 
afghanistan white said

the visit last week of new york cardinal john 
oconnor to cuba marked the latest in a series of moves indicating 
greater government acceptance of religion in this communist nation 
thousands of worshipers filled cathedrals in havana and 
santiago cuba for masses celebrated by the roman catholic 
cardinal during his fourday visit 
one woman ruby jane padron said her husband alberto had been 
imprisoned 22 years simply for being a practicing catholic 
but when asked if she was afraid to be at the mass in havana 
she said nervous no we are not nervous here no that was in 
the past its different now the hands of the communists are 
easier not so harsh 
cuban leader fidel castro met with oconnor on wednesday night 
and according to the cardinal agreed to grant more visas for 
foreign nuns to come to cuba 
last month cuba authorized 19 foreign priests and an expatriate 
cuban clergyman to work in cuba along with the 210 priests already 
in the communist nation 
last year the government allowed importation of 30000 bibles 
and in 1986 the leadership called on citizens to respect the 
beliefs of churchgoers 
cuba now has an office of religious affairs and castro has made 
no secret of the fact that he would welcome a visit by the pope 
there apparently is more than one reason for this relaxation 
the number of roman catholics has decreased to an acceptable 
level by government standards 
when castro siezed power in 1959 about 85 percent of cubans were 
roman catholics now roman catholics make up an estimated 41 
percent of cubas 102 million people 
in addition the government has realized that its possible to 
be loyal both to the church and to the revolution 
theoretically it is possible and in reality it also is 
education minister jose ramon fernandez told reporters while 
touring havanas historical colonial section with oconnor 
even oconnor told reporters all of us in the united states 
would be revolutionaries i guess we are the product of a 
revolution ive never thought of myself as a bad catholic for that 
reason 
cubas treatment of religion began changing around 1985 after 
the publication of the book fidel and religion by the rev 
carlos alberto christo a brazilian priest 
castro told christo he never opposed the catholic chuch as an 
institution only those militant catholics from the rich 
class that supported the counterrevolution 
he described as models for communists the catholic nuns who 
work in cuban hospitals and mental asylums 
oconnor said he drummed the idea of the churchs 
resourcefulness into castro during their talk and castro responded 
eagerly 
castro welcomed the idea of having an american clergyman as a 
liaison between the us government and cuban political prisoners 
in an attempt to get the united states to accept the prisoners the 
cardinal said 
the two also discussed the possibility of church assistance in 
helping cuba obtain medical supplies unavailable on the island 
nation 
closer churchstate relations and especially a papal visit would 
boost cubas image abroad 
the church could be very very helpful in explaining to the 
world at large what is legitimate in the revolutionary government 
here in cuba oconnor said 
government officials turned out in force to greet oconnor and 
the cardinal indicated the vatican would pay close attention to 
this in deciding whether cuba should be added to the popes future 
itinerary 
the reaction in churches and on the street to oconnors 
presence gave credence to the cardinals comment that the faith in 
cuba is still solid despite years of restrictions 
one elderly woman clutching rosary beads rushed up to pastor 
james mccarthy oconnors secretary as he walked through the 
streets of old havana and told him what a wonderful thing the 
cardinals visit was 
no political system no ideology is going to be ultimately 
successful in driving the faith out oconnor said success 
could be achieved for a period of time but the seed is there and 
it keeps springing back into flower

a recent series of books and articles and a sharp 
political debate have bared some of the darkest and most sensitive 
moments of italys fascist past 
the treatment of jews the conduct of italys communist party 
and the plight of italian soldiers left to choose sides between the 
nazis and the allies all have come under scrutiny 
some of the issues are being used as fuel in current political 
maneuvering particularly in the struggle between the communists 
and the socialists for dominance of the italian left 
others have surfaced as italys jewish community prepares to 
mark the 50th anniversary of the racial laws enacted by benito 
mussolinis fascist dictatorship which foreshadowed deportations 
to nazi death camps 
the controversy involving the alleged complicity in war crimes 
of president kurt waldheim in neighboring austria brought a 
reminder that italian as well as nazi troops were occupying the 
balkans 
the probing has touched some raw nerves 
when renzo de felice a leading historian who wrote a highly 
respected biography of mussolini lectured at rome university he 
was heckled and harassed by leftist students 
de felice recently suggested antifascism was mainly serving the 
communist party and should be abandoned but other books praise 
italians who fought fascism 
we all looked at ourselves as antifascist and on the side of 
the allies says furio colombo the president of fiat usa and 
a columbia university lecturer who wrote the preface to the italian 
edition of american historian susan zuccottis book the italians 
and the holocaust 
the book published here in march by mondadori gives generally 
high marks to italians noting that italy shares with denmark the 
merit of the highest percentage of jews saved but it also makes 
the point that italians bear a share of guilt 
more than 8000 jews were deported and only about 900 of them 
survived 
it shouldnt be possible any longer to boast of the minimum 
number of italian jews put to death said colombo in his 
preface only one italian jew persecuted and there were 
thousands would already represent a crime serious enough to force 
a collective rethinking of the past 
any confusion about italians coming to terms with the past can 
perhaps be attributed in part to the shifting loyalties that 
evolved as italy became bogged down in world war ii leaving the 
country in a no mans land between winners and losers at the 
end 
mussolini came to power in 1922 launched an invasion of 
ethiopia in 1936 and took italy into world war ii on the side of 
nazi germany and japan 
he was ousted from power in rome in july 1943 after allied 
forces landed in sicily in september 1943 italy surrendered 
unconditionally to the allies 
in the meantime the germans helped mussolini escape from prison 
and established him in a puppet regime in the north italian 
partisans captured mussolini and his mistress clara petacci on 
april 27 1945 shot them and hung their bodies upside down at a 
gasoline station near milan 
one of the bitterest quarrels to emerge has pitted communist and 
socialist party officials over whether palmiro togliatti who led 
the communists from 1927 until his death in 1964 had abandoned the 
partys founder antonio gramsci to fascist prison 
the allegations center over whether togliatti from his exile in 
moscow had not tried to press the soviet union to negotiate the 
freedom of gramsci known more as a liberal thinker than the party 
boss 
togliatti was neither a saint nor a hero said former 
socialist premier bettino craxi drawing the rage of the communist 
leadership 
historian de felices point is that italy is illserved by a 
continued use of antifascism as a political reference point as if 
antifascist meant democratic 
i dont say you have to forget fascism de felice said in an 
interview with the associated press i say that today that the 
use of the label antifascism has allowed the communists to present 
themselves as the other parties it has given them a common 
heritage 
de felice also contends that the postwar laws forbidding 
reestablishment of the fascist party are anachronistic since 
there is a neofascist party the italian social movement which 
has consistently gathered around 6 percent of the vote 
the historian also told milans corriere della sera that the 
myth of fascism is over noting that mussolinis granddaughter 
a budding actress recently posed topless in an italian mens 
magazine 
others disagree that its time to move on 
colombo for example said that while he may agree with de 
felice intellectually some signal still has to be given about 
the evils of fascism 
the jewish community of about 40000 plans major commemorations 
this fall of the enactment of the racial laws that expelled jews 
from government positions and the military and put restrictions on 
their work schooling and possession of property 
its too soon to say let bygones be bygones said tullia 
zevi president of the union of italian jewish communities 
jewish leaders note that until 1938 the jewish community was 
fully integrated in italian society holding important posts in the 
military and government and even the fascist party 
another a point of controversy is whether pope pius xii did all 
he could to save the jews the zuccotti book praises the efforts of 
individual priests to protect italian jews 
the vatican which has repeatedly defended the efforts of the 
pope on april 13 ran excerpts in its daily newspaper from a new 
book by a german historian contesting allegations against pius xii 
the newspaper losservatore romano called it a vibrant and 
direct response to the denigrators of the pontiff

abcs nightline tonight begins a week of 
shows live from israel including a threehour panel discussion in 
jerusalem before an audience of 700 israelis and palestinians 
good lord only knows how the live discussion will turn out 
said nightline anchor ted koppel who has done shows in 
previous years from south africa the philippines and southeast 
asia 
this just seemed like one of those subjects that is so rich 
and meaty it really cant be covered in an hour or two over here 
so were going to spend a week over there said koppel before 
leaving for jerusalem from which most of the shows will be 
broadcast 
monday nights onehour broadcast will feature an interview with 
israeli defense minister yitzak rabin as well as other guests not 
yet lined up as of this weekend 
likewise guests for the town hall meeting on tuesday had 
not been determined koppel said participants would include 
israelis and palestinians though selection of palestinian 
representatives was difficult because israeli government officials 
will not participate if theres anyone sympathetic to the palestine 
liberation organization involved 
the trip was planned last year koppel said before the recent 
violence on the israelioccupied west bank prompted new interest in 
the conflict between palestinians and israelis 
what were trying to do is make it clearer to an american 
audience what the different positions are and also make it clear 
what youre dealing with is not a homogenous israeli point of view 
or for that matter a homogenous palestinian point of view there 
are shadings said koppel 
part of what were going to try to do out there and id say 
probably the most important thing we going to try to do is provide 
a context that critics of television i think quite correctly have 
suggested we have not been providing over the past couple of 
years 
the rest of the weeks schedule was not set though koppel said

secretary of state george p shultz attended 
religious services in the soviet union on sunday extolling the 
spread and acceptance of faith in a subtle jab at this nations 
institutionalized atheism 
shultz flew out of tbilisi the capital of the southern soviet 
republic of georgia in the caucasus mountains after a day of 
sightseeing 
he headed for brussels belgium to brief members of the north 
atlantic treaty organization on his talks in moscow thursday and 
friday with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze 
before he left in tblisi and in kiev he delivered an overt 
message on religious freedom attending the georgian orthodox 
cathedral here sunday and st sophias cathedral in kiev on 
saturday 
even at a lavish lunch here with dozens of writers singers and 
artists shultz went out of his way in a toast to say i could 
feel in a sense i was in the presence of the creator 
in kiev shultz also visited babi yar the nazi killing ground 
in world war ii where tens of thousands of jews and other 
ukrainians were slaughtered 
we have to say to ourselves always never again shultz 
vowed 
in st sophias a cathedral that communist authorities have 
converted into a museum shultz said the majestic building just 
shows you the commitment of and power of religion 
in an evolving human rights policy shultz has kept up us 
pressure on the soviets to expand jewish emigration while pressing 
for more freedom of religious practices for all citizens 
tblisi a relatively relaxed city far from moscow has 
functioning churches and even two jewish synagogues shultz 
addressing the patriarch iliya ii and the congregants who jammed 
the small cathedral said he understood their desire for progress 
in belief in religion 
you must be meaning progress in the spread and acceptance of 
faith because it has an immense continuity shultz said it 
couldnt be more evident them being here in this church 
shultz and shevardnadze reported little progress in the talks 
which focused on a treaty that would halve us and soviet arsenals 
of strategic nuclear weapons 
the goal had been to complete the treaty by may 29 when 
president reagan journeys to moscow for a summit meeting with 
gorbachev but officials have expressed doubt the pact will be 
ready by then because too many disagreements remain

oliver ratliff doesnt know what the 
12000pound acornshaped piece of iron is but he likes it 
workers from ratliff bros amp co were clearing a site for a 
restaurant in abingdon when they dug up the massive object buried 
about a foot underground 
his workers hauled it back to kewanee thinking the iron might 
be worth several hundred dollars but ratliff says the mystery 
object has brought him so much attention he wont scrap it 
now kewanee is abuzz as folks in this town of 14500 try to 
figure out what it is 
at first we were worried it was a bomb said ratliff 68 
who has unearthed many strange things in his 46 years in the 
construction business 
army bomb specialists examined the find tuesday and determined 
it wasnt a bomb but that was all they could say 
everyone in town is plotting and scheming to explain what this 
thing is said steve bialowbreski a truck dispatcher at 
ratliffs there is no way its a wrecking ball because its too 
heavy and theres no way to hook on to it 
ratliff ran his hand along the rusted exterior of the object as 
it sat friday in the rear of his companys yard 
whatever it is it sure was made nice he said 
some ratliff workers think the 3by5foot hunk of iron is an 
old bank safe 
retiree jim cinnamon speculated that the thing was a weight used 
to anchor something huge a blimp or a crane farmer john betts 
theorized its the base for a flagpole 
ratliff and some of his friends have tried with no success to 
drill into the object 
with the mystery unsolved ratliff is considering sandblasting 
the knob painting it and using it to mark the entrance to his 
business 
maybe it would become a tourist attraction he said

emerged as winners 
teams from yale university and brown took sides in the final 
round of the national debate championships on whether to abolish 
the senate 
yale senior bart aronson taking his role of prime minister for 
a makebelieve her majestys government quite seriously denounced 
the senate as fundamentally undemocratic he called it a rich 
mans club that slows the legislative process and unfairly shifts 
power to small states 
his partner victor miller pressed the attack questioning the 
purpose of creating a congress with two houses the 200yearold 
compromise between large states like virginia and small ones like 
rhode island 
why should an artificial boundary like a state have a voice

artificial except for rivers theres nothing separating us from

george bushs spokesman suggests that there 
is something really unseemly about efforts to promote this or 
that person as the ideal vice presidential candidate 
democrat michael dukakis is even more blunt the nominee makes 
that decision he says 
but the people who are promoting various running mates as the 
only real hope for the republican or democratic ticket in the fall 
are not easily discouraged 
to begin with they tend to be people who thought neither bush 
nor dukakis had a chance of surviving the primary season depending 
on their place on the political spectrum they spent much of the 
past year dreaming that mario cuomo or edward m kennedy pat 
buchanan or jeane kirkpatrick would bring some excitement to the 
presidential race 
bush was saddled with the wimp factor with irancontra and 
his unwillingness to talk about where he differed with president 
reagan he was giving new definition to the phrase loyal to a 
fault 
and dukakis was the country ready to turn from ronald reagan to 
the governor of massachusetts the state that is a national symbol 
of liberalism and talk about dull dukakis often seemed to put 
himself asleep 
despite the skeptics here they are as close to a sure thing 
as you get in american politics 
the pennsylvania primary on tuesday should give bush the 1139 
delegates he needs to claim a majority at the republican national 
convention next august in new orleans 
that same primary should give dukakis a fourth straight primary 
victory and convince most of the remaining doubters that the 
massachusetts governor will be the candidate chosen in atlanta in 
july to recapture the white house for the democrats 
but the skeptics still doubt either man can win in november 
without considerable help from a carefully chosen running mate 
dukakis has a perceived problem of geography 
not since 1976 when georgian jimmy carter was at the top of the 
ticket has a democratic presidential candidate carried the south 
carter carried 10 of 11 southern states in 1976 but four years 
later lost 10 of 11 states in the region to ronald reagan 
this year conventional wisdom is the democrats need to carry 
the south 
southern legislators came up with the dubious idea of a southern 
regional primary as the way to ensure that the party would pick 
somebody acceptable to the south 
but the big winners on super tuesday were dukakis and jesse 
jackson sen albert gore jr of tennessee the favorite of the 
white southern establishment also did well but never could win a 
major state outside the region 
to bolster his southern strength dukakis is being urged to 
choose from a small group of southern senators sam nunn of 
georgia lloyd bentsen of texas or bob graham of florida 
nunn is viewed as the partys most impressive spokesman on 
national security issues an area where dukakis is seen as 
potentially vulnerable but on domestic policy nunn is a reagan 
democrat bentsen and graham have more basic credentials each 
comes from a state that is high on the democrats short list of 
those their nominee must carry in november 
neither bush nor his party has to worry as much about geography 
after all bush is from practically everywhere claiming ties with 
massachusetts where he was born connecticut where he grew up 
texas where he now has a home and maine where he has a home and a 
burial plot 
in obvious contrast to the democrats the republicans have been 
looking unbeatable in the south and west in recent presidential 
elections 
but bush makes a lot of republicans nervous some think hes a 
weak candidate others find him ideologically suspect 
the partys conservative wing wants a signal from bush that he 
is a loyal conservative who wont ditch the reagan agenda if he 
becomes president what they now view as the clearest signal would 
be the choice of one of their own as his running mate 
few people set conservative hearts aflutter like jeane 
kirkpatrick the hardline former un ambassador so now comes curt 
clinkscales a conservative activist who has formed an 
unauthorized committee to draft mrs kirkpatrick for the gop ticket 
an effort the former ambassador disavowed through a spokesman 
she believes the decision on the vice president should be 
solely that of vice president bush said mark salter 
nor was it encouraged by peter teeley spokesman for bush 
these efforts are sometimes embarrassing to the people that 
theyre allegedly designed to help he said theres just 
something really unseemly about trying to force somebody onto a 
ticket to throw them forward in an effort they havent 
sanctioned themselves 
about the only politician who regularly campaigns for the vice 
presidential nomination is endicott peabody the former governor of 
massachusetts who now resides in new hampshire 
however rep jack kemp of new york who was a conservative 
favorite in the early stages of this years presidential campaign 
now is coming as closed to peabody as he can get 
kemp denies hes running for the vice presidency but makes no 
secret that hed love to have the job 
anybody in the republican party would have to look upon the 
vice presidency with interest he said but and it was a very 
large but i said i dont expect it

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev is facing 
serious obstacles in his effort to overhaul the troubled 
inefficient soviet economy and things arent likely to improve 
anytime soon according to us intelligence agencies 
gorbachevs ambitious program to create a modern more dynamic 
soviet economy ran into trouble in 1987 says a joint study by 
the central intelligence agency and the defense intelligence agency 
the shortterm outlook for gorbachevs economic program is not 
good concluded the study which was released sunday by the 
congressional joint economic committee 
the real loser in 1987 appeared to be the consumer who now 
three years into gorbachevs economic program has seen almost no 
increase in his standard of living the study said 
the main problems last year were poor weather and resistance to 
change in the huge slowmoving soviet bureaucracy said the report 
as a result the soviet gross national product grew only 05 
percent last year compared with a 39 percent increase in 1986 
which was the first full year of gorbachevs term 
the gross national product is the total value of all goods and 
services produced and is a key measure of an economy 
by contrast the us gnp grew by 29 percent in both 1986 and 
1987 but the american economy is much larger and exact comparisons 
are difficult to make 
sen william proxmire dwis chairman of the joint economic 
committee said the study shows the soviet economy did not pause 
last year it stumbled this does not mean that the reform program 
is necessarily doomed or that gorbachev will be ousted 
it is still too soon to pass judgment on the reforms or on 
gorbachevs leadership proxmire said 
the study predicted that unless gorbachev can turn things 
around he faces trouble 
tension within society and the leadership will increase it 
said bureaucrats will become increasingly frustrated by loss of 
privileges and status and by demands that they show greater 
initiative military leaders are likely to become more and more 
uneasy if benefits from the industrial modernization fail to 
materialize 
soviet citizens will need to see some improvement in living 
standards if the regime is to achieve necessary gains in worker 
productivity and avoid widespread discontent the study said 
failure to head off these tensions would at a minimum make 
it more difficult to pursue his economic program vigorously and 
could ultimately call into question his strong political position 
at home the study said 
the study was presented april 13 the joint economic committee 
released a declassified version 
when gorbachev took over in march 1985 the study noted he 
inherited an aging backward extremely inefficient economy he 
made reform a top priority 
last years problems were caused by a combination of factors 
the study said 
familiar problems with poor weather and transportation 
bottlenecks were compounded by the disruptions caused by the 
introduction of economic reforms it said 
agricultural output fell because of bad weather industrial 
quality control measures also proved to be particularly 
disruptive especially early in the year thus industry only 
grew 15 percent and the civilian machinebuilding sector didnt 
grow at all

gov arch moore is finding that perhaps 
his toughest opponent in his reelection bid is the image he helped 
create for himself 
the almost mythical moore benefited from an influx of federal 
funds and a healthy economy as he opened highways constructed 
buildings and created jobs during his first two terms from 1969 to 
1977 
but he has been criticized during his third term as skippering a 
rudderless ship awash in financial problems that the captain cannot 
or will not control 
moore 65 faces his first serious political challenge in may 
10s gop primary in which he is seeking an unprecedented fourth 
term his opponent morgantown businessman john raese is an 
aggressive campaigner who has capitalized on the states woes 
everybody changes as they mature former state gop chairman 
kent strange hall said of moore i think the real changes are the 
circumstances and conditions in which hes operating 
number one he doesnt have the money that was available 
either through federal funding or the states economy and 
secondly he doesnt have the team of department heads and advisers 
he had in the first eight years 
moores administrative abilities have drawn the most fire even 
administration officials concede that when moore was returned to 
office in 1984 people expected a miracle turnaround that moore has 
been unable to produce 
the governor can point to a record of hard work a gradual 
reduction in the unemployment rate and increased industrial 
development but the days of major announcements have ended 
a spokesman for the state manufacturers association for 
instance says the state has lost 36 major plants between 1979 and 
1986 idling 4450 workers and said 28000 manufacturing jobs were 
lost in the plants that remain open 
moores first two terms were marked by a burgeoning economy 
federal money poured into the state and moore took the credit he 
seemed to be everywhere at once opening 225 miles of west 
virginias 515 miles of interstate highway overseeing construction 
of the state science and cultural center on the capitol grounds 
and luring new businesses 
the myth of the allknowing allseeing leader is one that he 
helped cultivate in a state where registered democrats outnumber 
republicans 21 
even a 1976 federal extortion indictment did not slow him on 
the day he was indicted moore called a news conference to announce 
he would seek a third consecutive term although the state 
constitution appeared to prohibit it 
moore was acquitted but the state supreme court barred his 
reelection bid 
he left what he said was a 234 million budget surplus a 
booming interstate highway building program and reasonably strong 
coal steel and glass industries 
moore opened a law practice and ran unsuccessfully for the us 
senate in 1978 and governor in 1980 
when moore again entered the governors office for an 
unprecedented third term in 1985 he found the state in much 
different shape 
the unemployment rate hit 18 percent the year before as the 
states economy hit rockbottom the state faced a 250 million 
debt in the unemployment compensation fund that had been run up by 
democratic gov jay rockefeller the legislature had enacted huge 
tax increases and federal funding for highway construction and 
other projects dwindled 
moore asked the legislature for a myriad of economic tools to 
attract business and later claimed success he says he has 
attracted more than 1 billion in development money during each of 
the past two years and that the unemployment rate dropped below 11 
percent in 1987 
critics however scoffed at his economic announcements saying 
thousands have fled seeking jobs elsewhere a west virginia 
university study found the state lost 52600 of its 19 million 
residents since 1980 
raese a newspaper publisher and coal and limestone company 
owner calls himself a conservative probusiness candidate he 
says moore has failed to adjust spending to the states dwindling 
tax income 
arch moore is just a credit card governor raese said during 
a recent interview hes marching to an old liberal tune of the 
late 1950s and early 1960s 
according to a poll released today raese holds a substantial 
lead over moore among republicans and independents 54 percent to 
30 percent sixtynine percent of the republicans surveyed rated 
moores performance as governor as poor or fair 
the poll conducted by the associated press the charleston 
daily mail and wsaztv had a margin of error of 44 percentage 
points

scientists have concluded that acid rain is one 
of the main pollutants threatening marine life in atlantic coastal 
waters the new york times reported monday 
up to now most experts have assumed that agricultural runoff 
and sewage were the major culprits responsible for the increasing 
number of mass killings of marine life along the northeast coast 
the newspaper said 
but a new report prepared by scientists of the environmental 
defense fund a nonprofit environmental group shows for the first 
time that acid rain is also contributing to the problem according 
to the newspaper 
acid rain comes from nitrogen oxides in emissions from 
automobiles power plants and other industries the oxides are 
converted into nitric acids and nitrates in the atmosphere 
nitrate salts and other nutrients encourage the growth of algae 
which in turn use up oxygen needed by other plants and animals 
living in the coastal waters according to the report 
it is choking off the oceans nurseries said dr michael 
oppenheimer an atmospheric physicist for the environmental group 
and a coauthor of the report it is shutting down the playground 
for millions of americans 
it is a regionwide problem and it is only going to get worse 
because of the projected growth of nitrogen emissions he added 
the study focuses on chesapeake bay and its tributaries and 
found that atmospheric sources account for 25 percent of the 
nitrogen pouring into the bay each year 
fertilizers account for 34 percent sewage and other industrial 
discharges 23 percent and animal wastes including runoff from 
land and evaporated ammonium from manure that travels through the 
atmosphere 18 percent 
if current trends continue atmospheric nitrates will constitute 
42 percent of annual nitrogen deposits into the bay by the year 
2030 according to the report 
the conclusion of the report was endorsed by other scientists 
who have read drafts of it including joel s oconnor an 
ecologist with the waste management institute of the state 
university of new york at stony brook according to the times 
george hidy director of the environment division of the 
electric power institute a research association of utility 
companies that emit large amounts of sulfur and nitrogen from their 
plants called the reports findings an interesting and 
surprising hypothesis that needs to be verified

michael m wiese has seen the vietnam war 
twice firsthand as a gunner on a helicopter and through fleeting 
images captured by soldiers on 8mm home movie film 
wiese 38 estimates he has collected 1000 hours of amateur 
footage during the last decade some of it is entertaining and some 
is boring but little is gory all of it helps neutralize the 
nightmare of vietnam wiese says 
he has pieced together some of his best footage in a 90minute 
videocassette being test marketed in the indianapolis area the 
tape helicopter gunship assault is the first of what wiese 
hopes will be a series of at least six tapes 
in 90 percent of the film its unknown to me who took it or 
where it was taken he said but still everybody wanted to 
watch it because what a soldier would take a picture of over there 
just to show mom was not what they were showing on the news 
to wiese who spent seven months behind a machine gun aboard an 
army helicopter the film is the best therapy i ever had its 
like reliving a nightmare if you relive it long enough its not a 
nightmare anymore ive watched this 300 times and im never bored 
nam was such a hard story for everybody to tell people back 
home about he said this makes the memories bubble out of 
you 
some footage shows soldiers escaping the war on a muggy day by 
landing their helicopters on a riverbank and taking a swim another 
scene shows helicopters dropping down to rescue patrols under 
attack there are scenes of helicopter gunships firing at ground 
targets and receiving return fire 
most of the footage is remarkably intact after 20 years little 
of the color has faded 
one pilot shows the hut he made from scrap wood and discarded 
rocket boxes after his tent rotted through 
another narrates as a dog yaps in the background 
if you watch over to the left youll see the tracers coming 
up at us he says there they are 
wiese says he has come across few gory scenes i have some 
helicopter accidents he says i got aftermath of an ambush 
but actual combat footage i dont have much he said soldiers 
were paid to keep their heads down 
vietnam was the first war in which soldiers could carry a 
lightweight camera with automatic shutter control and focusing 
capability 
still wiese says very little 8mm footage was shot in vietnam 
his first three reels were purchased for 1 each at a flea 
market they were very boring he said 
i wanted at one time to collect photographs i lost my own 
collection he said and everyone has photos but the 8mm stuff 
is real rare 
so he started placing ads in local papers and national 
publications asking veterans to send him their film he then 
transferred the film to vhs tape returning one tape and the 
original film to the owner and keeping a copy for himself when 
possible he got the soldiers to send an audio cassette narrative 
wiese who formed a company called vietnam archives has the 
owner sign an agreement giving him rights to the film i promise 
to give them a royalty on each cassette he said 
he hopes to place his videos in libraries 
im no steven spielberg said wiese my intention is a 
real simple one to collect this film and save it i think some of 
it is worth being preserved

it was part of what explorer zebulon pike in 
1806 called the great american desert the high plains where grass 
was the natural crop and buffaloes roamed far and wide 
pikes adventures along the arkansas river to the rocky 
mountains gave rise to a notion at the time that the huge region of 
low rainfall short grass and few natural water holes was a natural 
barrier that would limit us westward expansion 
farmers tried to tame it with the plow but often drought and 
crop failure dominated the huge region generally west of the 100th 
meridian dryland farming the settlers found was a precarious 
business in the great american desert 
it began to change after enterprising farmers tapped underground 
water supplies for largescale irrigation a huge invisible lake 
the ogallala aquifer was a gold mine for parts of texas new 
mexico oklahoma kansas colorado and nebraska 
but for years the underground water level has been receding 
forcing deeper drilling and greater pumping costs already 
irrigation has become uneconomical for many 
in order to maintain a viable agricultural economy this area 
must return to a dryland type of production says agriculture 
department economist wendell holmes in the current issue of 
farmline magazine how soon the transition will be made depends 
somewhat on how willing farmers are to change their irrigation 
practices 
holmes said it seems reasonable to assume that some 
irrigation will continue for a number of years new technologies 
and more droughttolerant plants may help for a time 
whatever the time though adjustments must be made in order 
to be ready when the wells run dry he said 
holmes and a colleague mindy petrulis in the departments 
economic research service studied an area of the high plains in 
west texas which included seven irrigated counties and eight 
neighboring dryland counties 
the irrigated counties included castro crosby floyd hale 
lamb parmer and swisher while the dryland counties were baylor 
cottle foard haskell king knox stonewall and throckmorton 
holmes said the irrigated counties enjoyed an economic boom in 
the 1940s and 1950s as irrigation became widespread a move to 
center pivot systems made it possible to nearly triple yields 
of cotton wheat and corn on land previously farmed without 
irrigation 
by 1960 the texas high plains had become one of the most 
irrigationdependent areas of the united states 
but the nearby dryland counties which lie just to the east of 
the ogallala aquifer have never had enough water from surface or 
belowground sources to develop agriculture based on irrigation 
holmes said that has been apparent from their economic performance 
beginning in the 1940s 
the economy of the dryland farming area continued to stagnate 
and periodically worsen because of the lack of water for crops 
holmes said one effect has been a continued heavy outmigration 
of rural people 
for example between 1940 and 1984 the total population of the 
dryland counties was cut in half and employment was reduced by a 
fourth 
in contrast holmes said the irrigated counties experienced 
rapid economic growth and development during most of the 194084 
period despite a small decline in the last few decades total 
population in the mid1980s exceeded 100000 people a 38 percent 
increase from 1940 and employment at about 41000 was up nearly 80 
percent 
meanwhile in the dryland counties that werent blessed with an 
abundance of water farms grew larger and fewer in order to 
maintain their incomes and population dropped by 32 percent from 
1940 to 1959 
dryland farming does not require a large labor force nor can 
it support a large rural or urban population holmes said 
thus there was little inducement for people to move into the 
area or having been born there to stay more and more people 
found employment elsewhere 
but by 1960 the fasttrack development of the irrigated 
counties slowed down from 1959 to 1978 he said the value of farm 
products sold increased about 60 percent compared with a tenfold 
increase in the previous 19 years 
and by 1978 almost 2400 irrigation farmers had gone out of 
business and 140000 acres of cropland had been taken out of 
irrigation rising costs of energy took a toll 
the tough times continued among dryland farmers too population 
in those counties dropped by more than a fourth from 1959 to 1978 
total employment was down more than a tenth and 31 percent of the 
farm operators went out of business holmes said 
in the 1980s the financial situation for farmers across the 
nation deepened as debt piled up land values declined and interest 
rates edged higher 
between 1978 and 1984 the total value of farm products sold 
dropped 4 percent in the irrigated counties while they increased 
about 10 percent in the dryland area 
holmes said the population of the irrigated counties in 197884 
declined about 3 percent and total employment decreased for the 
first time since the great depression of the 1930s 
the trends were much different in the dryland counties farm 
income rose 22 percent compared with an 18 percent decline in the 
irrigated counties 
holmes said that was because the proportion of total farm sales 
from wheat in the dryland areas tripled from 1978 to 1984 because 
of government price support programs and dryland farm operations 
cost much less 
in fact he said per capita income in the dryland counties in 
1984 was higher than it had ever been in the irrigated counties 
unfortunately the long decades of decline in the dryland counties 
had resulted in a grim bottoming out 
so many people have left that the economy has finally 
stabilized and most of those who remain are those with the jobs 
that are still available holmes said

the house will revisit familiar battlegrounds 
this week when it takes up a massive pentagon budget bill and tries 
to decide how much to spend on star wars and nuclear missiles such 
as the midgetman and mx 
we dont seem to be able to decide anything once and for 
all said armed services committee chairman les aspin dwis as 
he looked forward to the annual debate over how much money to 
authorize for the largest single agency of the federal government 
it will take at least two weeks for the democraticcontrolled 
chamber to plow through the huge bill and the 240 amendments which 
already have been proposed 
the pentagon budget sparks long debate each year aspin noted 
because house rules require that amendments be germane to the 
subject of the bill at hand 
that tends to limit debate on other measures but aspin said 
anyone who wants to offer an amendment on just about anything can 
find something in the defense bill that it is germane to 
the bill authorizes the pentagon to spend 299 billion in the 
fiscal year beginning oct 1 an amount that was set five months 
ago white house and congressional leaders agreed on the overall 
figure in december as part of a package designed to reduce federal 
deficits 
the agreement on the overall budget left us free to 
concentrate on smaller issues aspin noted it also speeded up 
the process of writing the bill which normally doesnt go to the 
house floor until june or later 
the 299 billion is 33 billion less than the pentagon had 
expected to have and defense secretary frank carlucci has ordered 
reductions in a number of programs to meet that goal 
while the total budget is less than the pentagon wanted the 
huge bill includes money to buy another trident missilefiring 
submarine two more attack submarines the first of a new class of 
seawolf subs 180 f16 jets 42 f15s 72 apache attack 
helicopters 611 m1 tanks 550 bradley fighting vehicles and 
three navy destroyers 
the measure which passes the house will eventually have to be 
reconciled with the bill the senate approves the senate armed 
services committee has just begun the process of writing its 
defense bill meaning the measure isnt likely to reach the senate 
floor until midyear or later 
as in past years one of the major battles will be over the 
budget for reagans star wars program known formally as the 
strategic defense initiative 
reagan sought 48 billion for the program which is receiving 
39 billion this year but aspins committee cut the figure to 
40 billion barely above the current budget and 600 million less 
than the amount set last week by a senate subcommittee 
i expect well have moves on the star wars budget from both 
the right and left said aspin explaining that conservatives 
will try to increase the sdi budget while liberals will seek to cut 
it 
during the committee consideration of the bill there were four 
amendments to set the sdi budget and at least that many are likely 
to be offered on the floor 
another contentious issue is the midgetman versus mx fight both 
the nuclear weapons are landbased missiles and are designed to 
replace the aging minuteman as part of the nations atomic 
deterrence force 
reagan originally wanted 100 of the 10warhead mx weapons but 
congress approved only 50 for basing in western silos and said the 
pentagon should develop the singlewarhead mobile midgetman 
because it would be easier to hide from soviet attack 
now the pentagon is proposing to build 50 more mx weapons and 
put them aboard trains to make it tougher for the soviets to find 
the missiles 
reagan sought 840 million for the railroad version of the mx 
and 200 million for research into midgetman carlucci said the 
latter amount was included only to meet a congressional request to 
keep the program alive until reagans successor can make a decision 
on its future 
but aspins committee gave 500 million each to midgetman and mx 
and youll see a number of amendments to redivide that pie on 
the floor he said i dont know where well come out 
eventually on that one 
the house will also consider a variety of arms control 
restrictions similar to those which were added on the house floor 
last year 
one would require continued us adherence to the unratified 
salt ii nuclear arms treaty a pact that reagan says he will no 
longer follow another would block all but the smallest tests of 
us nuclear weapons while a third would continue a 3yearold 
moratorium set by congress on testing of antisatellite weapons 
the administration opposes all three measures

members of the us senate have been trying to 
put their legislative affairs on a faster track but have been 
stymied by a problem some of their constituents have long faced 
slow trains 
in the senates case the problem is a 30yearold subway system 
that links two of the three senate office buildings to the capitol 
the senators complain the subway trains just dont move often 
enough and fast enough to get them to the senate chambers for 
rollcall votes 
now a senate committee has asked the capitol architect to come 
up with a full report on the costs of modernizing the subway 
system an early estimate of the price tag 10 million 
the senate made its first stab at making legislating a more 
orderly affair in february when it put itself on a new work 
schedule 
one of the changes was to limit rollcall votes which 
sometimes took an hour or more while the senate waited for an 
absent member to arrive to a strict 15 minutes each no 
exceptions 
shortly after the new rules were enacted several members 
complained that they had arrived at the station at the hart office 
building some four blocks from the capitol with a minute or two 
to spare to make a roll call but the subway car was jammed with 
visitors they had to wait for the car to return a round trip 
takes about five minutes and they missed the vote 
half of the 100 senators have offices in the hart building 
after complaints were made new rules were issued for the 
subway no one but senators can ride during rollcall votes 
the senate rules and administration committee also called on 
capitol architect george white to study the subway system and seek 
a longterm solution to the problems facing senators coming from 
the dirksen and hart office buildings the russell office building 
has its own line with two sets of tracks 
white recommended to the committee last week that the senate 
replace the current twotrain shuttle system with a new system of 
four small trains following one another at oneminute intervals 
over what he described as a pinched loop 
the vehicles would stop at each station in dirksen and hart the 
current system has one car on the track to dirksen and one on the 
track to hart returning on the same line 
white said the new system could be completed in about 30 months 
and would provide a greatly improved frequent fast and 
convenient service to and from the capitol 
white rejected another proposal for a moving sidewalk which he 
said would not be fast enough to handle the senates needs 
after white estimated the cost of the new subway at 10 million 
sen jake garn rutah asked now what do you estimate the real 
cost to be 
white replied that his estimate was conservative 
chairman wendell ford dky then asked white if he thought the 
cost would be more than 10 million white replied that he thought 
it would be less 
garn wasnt convinced 
having been here 14 years i have yet to see anything that 
didnt cost more than we originally estimated he said

the reagan administration is softening its 
opposition to democratsponsored fair housing legislation but still 
opposes provisions it says would deny the right to trial by jury 
and be unfair to elderly people according to a housing and urban 
development official 
another administration objection that a new ban of 
discrimination against the handicapped could force landlords to 
accept drug addicts or alcoholics was addressed in two amendments 
passed last week 
the bill expected to be voted on tuesday in the house judiciary 
committee would toughen enforcement of the fair housing act of 
1968 and expand it to ban discrimination against handicapped people 
and families with children in rental or sale of living space a 
similar bill has been introduced in the senate 
the administration had introduced its own fair housing 
legislation and favors an expansion of the act which now bans 
discrimination on the bases of sex ethnic origin or religion 
but it is wary of the version now being discussed in the house 
judiciary committee believing it may be unconstitutional and 
unfair to some landlords tenants and home buyers hud general 
counsel j michael dorsey said in an interview friday 
the committee last week rejected changes that would have met 
some administration objections but it tentatively approved one 
excluding abusers of controlled substances from being classified as 
handicapped 
another amendment would allow landlords or sellers to reject 
people whose tenancy would constitute a direct threat to the 
health or safety of other individuals 
dorsey said there is broad agreement that discrimination against 
the handicapped should be added to the law but he had said in a 
letter to the judiciary committee last week that the democratic 
version does not clearly allow those who provide housing to 
exclude individuals with current impairments such as current drug 
abuse that pose a threat to property or safety of others 
major objections to the bill have come from the justice 
department which opposes the setting up of an administrative law 
judge system to handle discrimination cases rather than having 
them go to a regular jury 
dorsey said that despite strong objections to parts of the 
proposed bill the administration is taking a softer stand than it 
has in the past but he said it has not altered its major 
objections to the democratic proposals 
we are not saying anything about a veto at this point at 
all he said 
president reagan has submitted four bills to amend fair housing 
laws in 1983 1985 1986 and this year dorsey said the current 
democratic bill is not the one that we would prefer 
but he indicated the administration wants fair housing laws 
expanded before reagan leaves office 
dorsey said the administration supports the idea that 
discrimination cases can be brought for single incidents rather 
than requiring that a pattern of discrimination be proven which is 
required under the 1968 law but he said the administrative law 
judge plan does not pass constitutional muster 
dorsey noted that the provision banning discrimination on the 
basis of familial status is designed to protect families with 
children 
but he said in the letter this provision intended to ensure 
fairness may well have substantial unfair effects on older 
americans and people without children 
the bill allows retirement communities or buildings where all 
the tenants are over 62 to ban children but singles communities 
that also have younger people in them would have to accept families 
with children 
ralph g neas executive director of the leadership conference 
on civil rights which endorses the democratic bill said that 
despite administration opposition he expects bipartisan support 
for the final measure 
this administration led by the department of justice has 
compiled the worst civil rights record of any administration in 
half a century neas said in a telephone interview 
but he said the justice department has failed in all previous 
efforts to limit civil rights and we believe once again a strong 
bipartisan consensus will reject this one

organizers expect tens of thousands of 
christians to gather in washington on friday for a rally and 
prayers for the future of the nation and the scandalplagued 
evangelical movement 
the washington for jesus rally which will be held on the grassy 
mall will lead into a sevenday aroundtheclock prayer vigil 
called national praise and prayer week that will end at 6 pm on 
may 5 
were gathering to ask god to heal our country and heal our 
church said the rev john gimenez pastor of rock church in 
virginia beach va and chairman of the rallys national steering 
committee 
the rallys aim gimenez said is to show repentance because 
the church has gotten away from the statutes of holiness to 
reconcile differences among christians and to restore the church to 
leadership 
we as christian leaders have a responsibility to our 
country gimenez said but weve been ineffective lately 
because weve had trouble within our own ranks we need to get 
back 
gimenez said he decided to organize the rally before the 
sexandmoney scandals brought down three of the bestknown 
television evangelists jim and tammy bakker and jimmy swaggart 
but he said he believes the rally will help the christian cause 
as well as help the country 
i heard the voice of the lord speak to me and say we should 
have a gathering he said 
gimenez says he got a similar message from god nearly a decade 
ago leading to the first prayer meeting on the mall in 1980 which 
attracted an estimated 200000 people 
we went to washington to pray at that time because our country 
was in trouble gimenez recalled we felt we should gather to 
ask forgiveness and to bring healing because our economy was in bad 
shape our citizens were being held prisoner in iran 
and lo and behold our economy improved and our citizens were 
released 
this time he said were finding many of the same problems 
the iranians our economy is getting shakier we have a drug 
epidemic 
although the rally is dedicated to reviving oldfashioned 
christian values it will rely on the latest in technology to get 
the message across 
nine huge screens similar to those in baseball parks will line 
both sides of the mall and stand behind the stage the screens will 
display the activities on stage and videotapes of people the 
audience will be praying for the stage according to a washington 
for jesus press release is capable of seating a 1500voice choir 
a 100piece orchestra a hundreds of dignitaries and christian 
leaders 
gimenez estimated the cost of organizing the rally at 13 
million 
among the scheduled speakers are singer pat boone tv minister 
kenneth copeland and christian radio show host james dobson 
gimenez said the rally will not have any political overtones 
pat robertson was a speaker at the 1980 rally but isnt on the 
schedule this time because he is running for the republican 
nomination for president gimenez said and he added while the 
rally is prochristian it is not against other religions 
this is a jesus rally he said we are not in opposition 
to other religious groups this is a free country they can have 
rallies too 
one major difference between the coming rally and the 1980 
gathering is in the national council of churches attitude eight 
years ago the council joined more than a dozen other religious 
organizations in issuing a statement accusing washington for jesus 
organizers of trying to christianize the government 
this year according to the rev ernest gibson the councils 
executive director rally sponsors sought our assistance from the 
beginning and they assured us that this will not just be a big 
splash and then theyll leave town 
they have agreed to help us develop drug treatment centers 
that will be operated by local churches and theyve agreed to help 
develop and support a christian network office that will promote 
fellowship among christians and meet human needs like those of the 
homeless gibson said 
weve also been assured that this will not be a political 
forum for a political candidate 
the rally will begin at 6 am on friday and last until 6 pm

over 3 billion worth of loans planned by 
intergovernment banks to raise the standard of living in 20 
countries are also likely to damage natural resources and the 
environment the us government says 
the united states is the biggest contributor to the banks which 
are a major source of aid to poor countries 
by law a list of loans considered dangerous by the us agency 
for international development will be distributed to other donors 
such as japan and the leading countries of western europe the 
associated press obtained an advance copy 
aid is particularly concerned about projects that dam up big 
rivers in the tropics that build roads into undeveloped parts of 
the world and that try to develop rural areas 
one of the biggest loans on the list would provide 420 million 
from the world bank for a dam on the narmada river in central 
india second only to the ganges in sacredness to hindus it will 
displace 120000 people irrigate about 720000 acres of land and 
generate 1000 megawatts of electricity 
the agency says the project could also increase the risk of 
earthquakes of waterlogging the soil and of transmitting 
waterborne diseases including malaria and cholera as many as 
96000 acres will be cleared of forest and submerged 
we continue to have concerns about this project and will 
pursue them again with world bank management as one of our top 
priorities the agency says 
congress has asked for such early warning reports to be made 
every six months 
we do not consider the list all inclusive the agency 
explains 
it adds that the object is to encourage better planning of new 
loan projects with the environment in mind 
six of the loans would go to indonesia including one from the 
world bank for 120 million to help a government effort that has 
moved over 12 million families out of the overpopulated islands of 
java and bali the us agency says it is worried about 
insufficient help to people being moved displacement of those who 
already live near the new settlements danger to water supply and 
to wildlife 
another controversial project also involves the world bank and 
its continued support for a major overhaul of brazils electric 
power system it involves a loan of 500 million 
the agency says it is concerned about the impact on brazils 
indian populations and the regions sensitive ecosystem 
british and west german officials joined the americans in talking 
to the banks management in january they were told that the loan 
had been delayed until september or october mostly for economic 
reasons 
the potential value of the 31 loans could be much higher than 3 
billion no estimates were available for five of them others are 
for major projects on which the banks have already made loans and 
may make more in the future

michael dukakis was getting his early 
morning exercise walking down a pittsburgh street when someone 
gave a cry of recognition hey isnt that caliguiri 
no it wasnt pittsburgh mayor richard caliguiri it was the 
frontrunner for the democratic presidential nomination 
i guess the mayor and i look alike dukakis said as he 
described the sunday morning greeting theres an old saying in 
italian one face one race were all part of the same family 
far ahead in the polls here for tuesdays primary dukakis said 
the incident shows we need to do a lot of work to make sure 
people know who dukakis is on the ballot 
the massachusetts governor himself is working hard taking a 
whistlestop train tour across western pennsylvania on sunday and 
making a sixcity flying tour of the state today 
dukakis is looking for a fourth straight bigstate win here over 
his surviving competitor jesse jackson to tighten his grip on 
the frontrunners crown and widen his margin in the delegate count 
if we can win big here tuesday it will give us a tremendous 
boost dukakis told a big crowd of students on the pennsylvania 
state university campus who were welcoming back his wife kitty a 
penn state graduate 
through the cold cloudy day in pittsburgh greensburg 
johnstown and altoona dukakis hit over and over again on his 
message of good jobs and economic development in a region 
devastated by changes in the steel and coal industries 
if we cant bring good jobs and economic opportunity back to 
the johnstowns of this country then there is something the matter 
with us he told a crowd there i believe we can i believe 
were going to 
dukakis drew the parallels between new englands economic 
troubles of the past and pennsylvanias troubles of the present 
as a new englander we went through the same kind of pain and 
economic distress as you have he said in greensburg our 
communities have come back and these communities are going to come 
back 
drawing on the two weekend debates between the democrats 
dukakis talked of how he and jackson agree on many issues 
instead of investing in a lot of exotic weapon systems of very 
marginal value weve got to take these resources and put them as 
both rev jackson and i said saturday into our infrastructure 
but on sunday dukakis brushed off suggestions from jackson that 
he should put out a budget 
you cant prepare a budget now for next year thats 
absurd he told reporters on the chartered amtrak train 
nicknamed the pennsylvania presidential unlimited 
and dukakis resisted pressure from a new jackson tactic urging 
massive new spending on education drug control efforts and other 
programs 
the frontrunner went down his own list of education programs 
which he says involve only modest spending increases while 
jackson said the federal government should double its spending on 
education 
were not going to run the nations school system from 
washington dukakis said the thing a president has to do is to 
set some priorities and get after them 
the democratic candidate also took a couple of swipes at george 
bush saying that the republican nomineetobe seems more 
interested in building aircraft carriers than in rebuilding the 
nations railroads and highways 
mr bush was critical of me because i oppose spending 36 
billion on two supercarrier task forces that we dont need and we 
cant afford dukakis said if he thinks thats where we ought 
to put our scarce resources then so be it but its going to be a 
fundamental issue in this campaign 
i think i know where the american people are they are tired 
of crumbling bridges congested airports jammed highways homeless 
people on streets and in doorways and they want a change 
if dukakis is the democratic nominee perhaps he will get a wish 
expressed wistfully in pittsburgh 
all of you know me i suppose wed all like to suppose that 
im a household word he told the small crowd id like one of 
these days to come to pittsburgh and hear hey isnt that

defense secretary frank c carlucci says 
predictions that the star wars missile defense system wont work 
are like saying 10 years before we had helicopters that 
helicopters were doomed to failure 
carlucci on sunday defended the administration program to create 
a hitech space shield against soviet missiles saying a panel of 
nongovernment experts believes the system is fundamentally 
sound 
he disputed a report in sundays edition of the washington post 
that quoted an unpublished congressional study as saying the system 
would suffer a catastrophic failure if it were used against a 
multiple missile attack from the soviet union 
thats about like saying 10 years before we had helicopters 
that helicopters were doomed to failure carlucci said in an 
interview on abctvs this week with david brinkley 
the study was conducted by the office of technology assessment 
a nonpartisan scientific arm of congress 
carlucci said he had a panel of nongovernment technicians and 
engineers evaluate star wars and it concluded that the program 
is fundamentally sound and that we can build a militarily effective 
sdi strategic defense initiative program and that is the goal 
carlucci said the defense department has been studying the 
congressional report which he described as long and complex but 
he said there has been no official comment on it 
he said sdi is a program that we are currently designing it 
has not even entered the developmental stage much less the 
deployment stage 
meanwhile the post reported in mondays editions that a 
highlevel pentagon panel has recommended to carlucci that he 
sharply cut the proposed initial sdi deployment from a system of 
spacebased weaponry to a less costly and much less effective 
system of groundbased rockets 
quoting unidentified senior pentagon officials the newspaper 
said the panel directed by robert everett chairman of the 
pentagons senior scientific advisory group has told carlucci that 
such a groundbased defense is worth pursuing as an initial step 
last september thendefense secretary caspar w weinberger 
approved the acceleration of six sdi programs the first decision 
to push star wars technologies from pure research toward 
development the six projects then entered what is known as a 
demonstration and validation phase in which various components 
needed for a working system would be tested 
no decision has been made on which of the six would be the first 
deployed 
the six programs which had been recommended by the defense 
acquisition board the pentagons highest internal review panel 
include 
the groundbased surveillance and tracking system a missile 
that could be fired into space to obtain tracking information on 
missiles approaching the united states 
the spacebased surveillance and tracking system a satellite 
system that would be deployed in space to identify and track enemy 
missiles 
the boost surveillance and tracking system another type of 
orbiting satellite system that would provide an alert if enemy 
missiles were launched 
the reentry vehicle interception system small missiles that 
could be fired from the ground to intercept and destroy enemy 
missiles during the middle and latter stages of their flight 
the spacebased interception system small kinetic kill 
rockets on an orbiting platform in space the rockets could be 
fired at enemy missiles shortly after launch and would destroy them 
through a direct collision 
and the battle managementcommand control and communications 
system the brains of any star wars defense this would consist 
of a series of highpowered computers that would be programmed to 
select targets and direct weapons against them 
in the interview sunday carlucci said the post story on the 
report by the office of technology assessment took selected 
quotes out of that report and drew conclusions from them what 
youre reading from is some kind of a leaked document he said 
the post said it had obtained the reports summary chapter 
the newspaper said the report shows that detailed computer 
instructions needed to destroy thousands of warheads streaking 
towards the united states probably cannot be produced in the 
foreseeable future 
the overall conclusion of the report is that despite five years 
and 12 billion worth of scientific research many questions 
remain about the feasibility of meeting sdi goals which include 
the ability to ward off a soviet missile attack and eventually 
eliminate the threat posed by soviet missiles

inmate dora teeters used to spend her days at 
the ohio reformatory for women in marysville dreaming about life 
outside prison walls 
shes still serving time for manslaughter but now she spends 
her days in this city 50 miles from prison renovating dilapidated 
houses with other inmates the work is done under the supervision 
of trained carpenters not corrections officers 
its a nice feeling to be trusted like this she said 
recently sitting on the front stoop of a house she is helping 
rebuild its a good feeling to work with your hands one day 
theres nothing there soon the job is finished and youre proud 
of what youve done 
ms teeters 29 who was convicted in 1984 is one of about 120 
inmates from the womens reformatory and lima correctional 
institution who have worked for limas rehab project 
david berger is the mastermind behind the project a nonprofit 
organization founded in 1977 that buys and renovates 1520 
abandoned houses each year the homes sell for 25000 to 35000 
usually to low and middleincome families 
berger started using workrelease inmates in 1983 with 
minimumsecurity male prisoners from the lima prison that was 
interrupted when the state changed the rules for honor inmates 
said berger the organizations executive director 
he called officials at the womens reformatory and they agreed 
to participate marking the first time female inmates were used in 
such a project in ohio 
the whole purpose was to teach fundamentally untrained people 
how to build housing he said 
under the guidance of the five fulltime rehab project 
employees the women do all the carpentry work from gutting to 
finishing they dont do electrical work or plumbing both licensed 
trades or major excavation or floor covering 
in the last 11 years the project has helped rehabilitate 160 
houses 
in his office in an abandoned church berger a former seminary 
student said about 7000 of limas 18000 houses need extensive 
repair rehab project targets houses in different neighborhoods 
hoping others will spruce up their houses themselves 
when the program began rehab project bought abandoned houses 
bid repair work to contractors and then sold the houses that 
changed in 1979 when the organization became dissatisfied with the 
quality of the work and realized it could not recoup the cost of 
the extensive repairs needed 
so for the last nine years it has used volunteers 
the program currently uses 20 inmates but has a commitment from 
the corrections department to expand to 80 once in place those 
crews will be able to renovate 30 to 40 houses a year 
rehab project not only allows prisoners freedom to work it 
improves selfesteem and teaches a trade berger said 
we have watched teriffic transformations happen with people 
who have been out with us people who had never imagined themselves 
doing this kind of work people who had never had one inkling that 
they could be up on a roof not just working but somehow knowing 
how to install roof shingles installing furnaces installing new 
dry wall and finish he said

it was a typical night at elaines that 
ordinary restaurant with the extraordinary clientele woody allen 
was at his table albert finney held court at another paloma 
picasso stopped by 
and owner elaine kaufman table hopped playing the amiable host 
the worldlywise wisecracker the sounding board to the stars 
that was saturday tonight is expected to exceed even the starry 
standards of elaines as friends help celebrate the first 
quartercentury of the cluttered italian restaurant 
among those who said theyll be there actresses raquel welch 
and mary tyler moore director sidney lumet developer donald 
trump writer jackie collins and model cheryl tiegs 
this place is a living people magazine said bartender brian 
mcdonald 
elaines a watering hole for writers a wellspring for gossip 
columnists and a favorite target of food critics remains an 
anomaly in the fickle world of manhattan restaurants 
its a friendlylooking place with a reputation deserved or 
not for rudeness it has lasted 25 years despite universally bad 
reviews 
and though it is filled with beautiful people it may seem a 
dingy dump to those who know of it only through the gossip columns 
just a nice neighborhood restaurant is how elaine 
describes it a good bottle of wine a nice plate of pasta i 
mean thats life 
author gay talese a regular from the start said theres no 
officious maitre d in black tie saying wait at the bar while i 
see about a table here you have the bespectacled stout and 
smiling elaine greeting you and saying of course theres a table 
for you 
of course for him for talese that means one of the large 
round tables along the righthand side elaines wall of fame so 
to speak though its not true that tables are hard to come by it 
is true that the prominent ones are kept open for the regulars 
others are shunted to the rear 
im afraid you dont get treated very well if you dont have a 
pencil in your top pocket said author george plimpton whose 
colleagues at the paris review were among the first regulars 
a few weeks ago it was american literature 103 along the wall 
talese norman mailer kurt vonnegut arthur miller 
writers do tend to get together somewhat like grackles and 
what better telephone wire than the tables at elaines said 
plimpton 
when elaine plunked down 10000 for a hungarian bar in the 
unfashionable yorkville section in 1963 she already knew some show 
folk writers and artists from her days as a waitress and cafe 
manager in greenwich village 
actually what i did was just bring the village uptown she 
said 
one day the artist couple robert motherwell and helen 
frankenthaler stopped by and they kept coming in and they would 
bring their friends 
once primarily a writers haunt it has become a requisite stop 
for celebrities from all walks from prince edward to prince billy 
d williams to jackie mason 
allen who set the opening scene of manhattan in elaines 
comes because he loves to peoplewatch elaine said its 
comfortable nobody bothers him we make him what he wants 
anyone who wants to spend 350 for a bottle of beer can stand 
at the bar and peoplewatch too and listen to the stories 
like the time mailer and a lady friend were asked to leave after 
arguing with elaine over whether he could unscrew a light bulb 
above their table 
as he got up he said put the bill on my tab plimpton 
recalled and elaine said you havent got a tab here norman 
he reached into his pocket and threw a handful of change there 
was a great clattering of coins on the floor and by now it was a 
bit of a melee 
mailer vowed never to return and in fact had his own restaurant 
for a while but they always get pulled back somehow plimpton 
said

two years after the chernobyl power station was 
the scene of the worlds worst nuclear accident nepotism sloppy 
repairs and drunkenness are rampant at the facility pravda charged 
the problems cited by the communist party daily were similar to 
those the government blamed for an explosion and fire at the plant 
on april 26 1986 
last july three officials in charge of the plant during the 
accident were convicted of gross negligence and sentenced to 10 
years in a labor camp 
pravda said on sunday that during the last two years engineering 
jobs at the plant have been handed out to medics teachers 
veterinarians and people without any higher education 
it also accused chernobyls managers of trying to resolve at 
any cost obstacles to full electricity production at the plant 
to the detriment of the quality of repair and maintenance of 
extremely intricate equipment 
judging from all this the leadership has not learned a 
lesson from the past pravda said its as though there hasnt 
been an accident 
the explosion at the plant 80 miles north of the ukrainian 
capital of kiev killed 31 people spewed radiation around the world 
and forced the evacuation of 135000 soviets living nearby 
the scathing attack in pravda was a departure from the numerous 
articles appearing in the soviet press before tuesdays anniversary 
previous stories have stressed the extensive safety equipment 
installed at chernobyl improved worker training the decrease to 
safe levels of radiation and the return of people to surrounding 
areas 
pravda began by reporting safe radiation levels at the plant and 
the production of 21 billion kilowatthours of electricity there 
since the accident 
but then the focus turned to criticism by the kiev regions 
communist party committee of kombinat the organization 
supervising the plant and cleanup around it 
plant equipment was repaired without technical supervisors and 
was not tested before being put into service despite serious 
defects the newspaper said 
some safety measures planned on the reactor no 4 at the plant 
were not carried out because of kombinats negligence pravda said 
that reactor in which the explosion occurred has been sealed in 
concrete laden with radiation sensors other official reports have 
stressed the danger from the no 4 reactor has been neutralized 
leadership posts were given to people who had criminal 
records who had been excluded from the party or had received 
strict party penalties pravda said 
units were headed by people not able to cope with the business 
they were entrusted with medics teachers veterinarians and 
people not having any higher education were working in engineering 
posts pravda said 
discipline was slack the newspaper said 
in the kombinat amalgamation drunkenness thievery and 
violations of labor discipline have not been reduced it said 
pravda did not say whether any corrective action had been taken 
other than to report that kiev party leaders reprimanded kombinats 
head and indicated he had been fired 
e ignatenko displayed liberalism and political immaturity in 
the evaluation of the lack of discipline multiple violations of 
organizational and financial discipline protectionism nepotism 
moral breakdown of leaders the paper said 
the article indicated that plant managers tolerated the 
shortcomings because of a widespread problem in soviet industry 
pressure to fulfill a production plan 
the government has said it must increase the production of 
nuclear power plants to meet the countrys electricity needs the 
chernobyl plant with two of its four reactors now operating has 
been ordered to generate 199 billion kilowatthours this year 
hints of problems at the plant first came in december v 
lukyanenko the communist party head in slavutich a new town for 
plant workers near chernobyl told a newspaper that sloppy work 
poor discipline and safety violations at the plant contributed to 
36 accidents over a 10month period three of them fatal 
yuri k semyonov deputy head of the chernobyl cleanup 
commission denied at a moscow news conference on wednesday that 
any major accident or deaths occurred at the plant since the 1986 
explosion

the leftofcenter labor party adopted a 
campaign platform saying israel will never completely withdraw from 
the occupied territories and that voters will be asked to approve 
any middle east peace settlement 
the platform for novembers election appeared to be more 
hardline than the us peace initiative initially backed by shimon 
peres the head of the labor party and the foreign minister in 
israels coalition government 
the platform adopted sunday apparently was aimed winning over 
voters on the right who might consider the party too dovish 
defense minister yitzhak rabin meanwhile told the cabinet on 
sunday that 1700 palestinians more than onethird of the 4900 
arrested since protests began dec 8 were being held without trial 
for up to six months 
israel media said rabin also criticized the justice ministry 
during the cabinet meeting saying it was hampering army efforts to 
deport more palestinian agitators israel has deported 20 
palestinians to lebanon since dec 8 and ordered the expulsion of 
at least four others 
also sunday the army lifted a fourday ban that had prevented 
arabs in the occupied lands from traveling to israel the army also 
permitted the delivery of gasoline to the occupied areas for the 
first time in more than a month 
no major clashes were reported between arabs and israeli 
soldiers in the occupied lands on sunday 
the labor party platform promised voters a final say either 
through elections or a referendum on any middle east peace 
settlement said labor spokeswoman michal cohen 
the platform written by peres also says israel will never 
withdraw completely from the west bank and gaza strip it captured 
in the 1967 middle east war ms cohen told the associated press 
it calls on israel to seek direct negotiations with a 
jordanianpalestinian delegation to be preceded by an 
international peace conference with strictly ceremonial functions 
the palestine liberation organization would not participate in the 
talks 
a negotiated interim agreement on limited selfrule for the 15 
million palestinians in the occupied lands would remain in effect 
for up to five years 
the document also specifies that a final settlement should allow 
no palestinian state in the west bank and gaza preserve all jewish 
settlements there and maintain jerusalem as the united capital of 
israel 
it says areas with a high percentage of arab residents may be 
turned over to palestinianjordanian control 
these specifics in the platform go beyond the us peace 
initiative which do not dictate any such terms the section on 
settlements remaining intact presumably would conflict with the 
views of the american government which has consistently urged 
limiting jewish settlements in the occupied territories 
peres call for giving israeli voters a final say on any peace 
plan has not been stated before the us peace initiative also has 
never directly said that any international peace conference would 
be strictly ceremonial in function 
prime minister yitzhak shamir head of the rightwing likud bloc 
said on sunday that israel would never part with the west bank 
and gaza strip in a speech to the central committee of his herut 
party shamir also suggested that gradual and limited palestinian 
selfrule was as far as he was willing to go 
labor and likud are in the fourth year of a fragile coalition 
peres and shamir traded jobs in october 1987 
also sunday the defense ministry asked the finance ministry for 
an additional 162 million to cover the cost of combating the arab 
uprising said spokesman eitan haber he would not elaborate and 
it was not immediately clear if that sum represented all the money 
the ministry has spent in connection with the uprising since dec 
8 or only a part of it 
last month the economics ministry said the uprising has cost 
israel 312 million in lost production lost exports and added 
security costs 
rabin also said 165 palestinians have been killed in the 
uprising including 147 by the army according to un figures the 
palestinian death toll has reached 173 an israeli soldier and 
jewish settler also have died

president roh taewoos government is 
battling to win crucial legislative elections and overcome 
revelations of highlevel corruption and widespread public distrust 
the governing democratic justice party is expected to win the 
largest number of seats in tuesdays national assembly election 
but it may have trouble retaining its majority government failure 
to keep control would be a major boost for the opposition 
roh who began a fiveyear term in february says the government 
must retain control of the assembly to keep its promises of 
sweeping democratic social and economic reform he accused the 
opposition of dividing the nation and fomenting unrest 
i still believe that the history of hate and darkness can 
never be resolved through revenge and that love and reconciliation 
are the only cures roh said during the campaign 
surveys by leading south korean newspapers indicate the 
governing party may fall short of its goal of winning 125 of the 
224 assembly seats to be decided by voting the surveys indicate it 
was assured of about 65 seats and was neckandneck in about 80 
other districts 
the assemblys remaining 75 seats will be divided on the basis 
of how many votes each party gets the assemblys power was 
increased by a new constitution and the president can no longer 
dissolve it 
but the rival opposition parties have repeatedly failed to unite 
against the government and they are seen as having little chance of 
winning the rival parties depend largely on regional support 
many opposition supporters are disillusioned by the disunity and 
squabbling for power between main opposition leaders kim youngsam 
and kim daejung they drew a combined 55 percent in decembers 
presidential race but their individual candidacies both trailed 
rohs 36 percent plurality 
the two kims symbolically resigned after the loss but remain in 
control of their parties 
the opposition has tried to discredit roh and his party with a 
corruption scandal involving former president chun doohwan 
chuns younger brother chun kyunghwan was charged on march 31 
with embezzling a fortune in cash stocks and land while he headed 
the semiofficial saemaul development program a government probe 
uncovered extortion influence peddling and theft 
kim youngsams reunification democratic party and kim 
daejungs party for peace and democracy claim the government has 
exposed only part of the corruption opposition leaders allege roh 
and other top leaders helped cover up corruption when they served 
under the chun administration 
kim youngsam told a rally the djps call for overwhelming 
support for what they describe as social stability is nothing but a 
clearcut expression of its determination to prolong rule by 
military officers tainted by political interests 
the government has fought back by insisting the issue was raised 
because of rohs promise during the presidential campaign to expose 
corruption under his predecessor 
south korea has experienced significant political liberalization 
since last summer and most controls on political activity have been 
dismantled roh has promised full democracy as quickly as possible 
but roh has not won broad public acceptance many koreans are 
distrustful of roh as a former general who helped put chun in power 
with military backing in 1980 roh has attempted to cut his ties to 
chun and his authoritarian rule 
chun who hoped to retain some power was forced to give up his 
remaining posts as a result of the corruption affair and his 
hardline loyalists in the party were purged 
hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets last june in 
massive protests against the chun government roh backed opposition 
demands for elections at the height of the violence 
electioneering for the national assembly has been restricted by 
limits on the number of rallies and bans on most forms of street 
campaigning 
a uniquely lackluster atmosphere prevailed in stumping 
rallies the korea herald reported in an analysis 
candidates from all the parties have wooed voters with cash 
meals day trips and other gifts that are a customary part of 
electioneering newspapers calcuate millions of dollars have been 
spent 
scattered violent clashes between rival supporters have marred 
some rallies and the government warned it would not tolerate 
unrest but the campaigning has been far less violent than in last 
years presidential election 
the politicians should not disappoint the people of this 
nation anymore said political analyst rhee chongik

the first round of the presidential election was a 
historic moment for two political parties the farright national 
front achieved unprecedented support and the communist party 
tumbled to an alltime low 
perhaps most important for the future of france was the 145 
percent won by jeanmarie le pen president of the national front 
the party has emerged as a significant new force in french 
politiics with its strident antiimmigrant french first 
campaign 
nothing ever again will be done in france without the voters 
of the national front exulted le pen 59 after the results 
became clear in sundays election he said there has been a 
radical transformation of the national political landscape 
premier jacques chirac who will face socialist president 
francois mitterrand in the may 8 runoff won only 199 percent of 
the vote and desperately needs national front support if he is to 
have any chance of overtaking the president who scored 339 
percent 
chirac has vowed he will not do a deal with le pen for his 
backing but he may have no choice but to do so despite the nearly 
universal condemnation it will bring him le pen says his 
instructions to his voters will depend on what chirac says and does 
in the coming week 
while le pens performance was a surprise well above the 10 
percent to 12 percent he had been accorded in preelection opinion 
polls the 68 percent won by andre lajoinie the official 
communist candidate was predictable and confirmed the steady 
decline that began in 1981 
the stodgy tightly structured communist party has been losing 
members for a decade essentially because it has failed to adapt 
its language to a changing french society which is better educated 
more sophisticated and less doctrinaire 
the communists were hampered by the candidacy of pierre juquin 
leader of a splinter reformist movement who won 21 percent 
the poor showing of the official communist candidate could lead 
to further internal party dissension of the sort that led to the 
rebellion by juquin and others over the past four years 
the communist party which once was the major force on the 
french left accounting for more than a quarter of the vote began 
to fall significantly with the 1981 presidential election when 
party secretary general georges marchais won only 153 percent of 
the vote 
that fell to 113 percent in the 1984 election for the european 
parliament and 98 percent in the 1986 national assembly election 
sundays score was the lowest registered by the french communist 
party in a national election since the party was founded in 1920 
the previous low was 84 percent in the 1932 legislative vote 
in the 1974 presidential election le pen won a minuscule 07 
percent in 1981 he was not even able to gather the 500 signatures 
of elected officials necessary to get on the ballot 
but in 1984 the national front thoroughly vilified by all of 
the traditional parties nearly equaled the communists in the 
european vote with 11 percent and matched them in the 1986 
legislatives with 98 
bruno megret le pens campaign manager called 1988 a major 
turning point in the political history of our country 
francois bachelot a national front deputy in parliament said 
the score was not just the most remarkable event of the first 
round of the presidential elections it is the essential political 
event of the postwar period 
the combined vote of chirac head of the conservative rally for 
the republic party and former premier raymond barre supported by 
the centerright union for french democracy totaled less than 37 
percent a serious setback for the traditional rightist parties 
though chirac rejects making overtures to the national front he 
boldly addressed le pens favorite themes in a short television 
appearance after the election was over 
he appealed to all those who want security to be assured and 
delinquence criminality and terrorism to be fought with all 
necessary firmness our national identifity to be preserved and 
clandestine immigration also to be fought 
political analysts generally agreed that le pens newfound 
support was based as much on a widespread dissatisfaction with 
traditional parties as his antiimmigration and lawandorder 
stands 
i am a little ashamed for france that a man like le pen 
has won 4 million votes said marchais that poses a problem 
for me and that poses a problem for my country he has taken votes 
from the workingclass electorate 
he added that france had no reason to be proud of a man 
whose policy is founded on racism 
lajoinie stressed that he waged my campaign not to be elected 
but to affirm demands for new policies he added in that 
context is is obvious that the real influence of the french 
communist party goes very far beyond the results that we registered 
today

apiece to provide each of its residents with public services

a government economist says it would be less 
costly to the us economy to add a gasoline tax of 2 or 3 cents 
than to steer car buyers away from purchasing big cars 
andrew n kleit a member of the federal trade commission staff 
says the us economy would lose 480 for every gallon of gas 
saved in dissuading people from buying big cars while just as much 
fuel would be saved by an additional tax on gasoline of 2 or 3 
cents a gallon 
people clearly get pleasure from buying large cars and i dont 
see anything illicit in that at all kleit said in an interview 
about his report the impact of automobile fuel economy 
standards he said the report represents his own views and not 
those of the ftc bureau of economics which published it as working 
paper no 160 
current transportation department standards require 
manufacturers to meet a 26 mpg fuel efficiency standard but that 
standard will increase to 275 mpg for the 1989 model year unless 
the department acts to make changes 
the lower standards imposed in 1975 were meant as a 
fuelsaving alternative to higher taxes on fuel or imported crude 
oil but environmentalists who want to see less fossil fuel burned 
support the higher standards 
but opponents of the higher standards including auto safety 
proponents estimate that a 1 mpg increase in the standard for 1989 
cars could mean an extra 220 to 390 deaths a year for a decade 
because the large cars people might be discouraged from buying are 
generally considered safer than small ones

a house committee says it is costing the 
government three to 10 times more to provide neonatal intensive 
care and other health and education expenses for babies born 
prematurely than it would to provide care for pregnant women with 
incomes below the federal poverty level who have those babies 
and the panel the house government operations committee 
recommended sunday that states be required to provide prenatal 
health care to prevent premature births 
the committee said only 26 states are currently taking advantage 
of a twoyearold option to extend medicaid to all pregnant women 
with incomes below the federal poverty level 
since the majority of women below the poverty line cannot 
possibly afford health insurance it is necessary to require 
medicaid coverage for pregnant women below the federal poverty 
line the report said 
citing various studies the report said professional prenatal 
care not including labor and delivery fees costs about 400 
while the lifetime cost of health and custodial care for a 
lowbirthweight handicapped infant can amount to 100 times that 
much 
about 40000 us infants born each year die before their first 
birthday a rate higher than many other industrialized nations

a task force report says its up to the marine 
corps commandant to set the tone that will help remedy continuing 
sexual harassment of women in the corps 
the report released sunday said existing directives and the 
corps primary grievance system are appropriate tools to 
implement marine corps policy on this issue but emphasized that 
the commandant must convey that sexual harassment will not be 
tolerated in the service 
the task force on women in the marine corps formed in september 
1987 at the request of thensecretary of navy james webb also said 
the corps did not have a significant problem with 
fraternization 
the report recommended certain steps to improve the quality of 
life for female marines including solving the problem of shortage 
in uniform items and lengthy delays in filling special orders 
ensuring full investigation when homosexual conduct is suspected 
and allowing a pregnant marine to request a 30day delay in the 
notification of her commander by the medical officer

a us defense contractor and the israeli 
government are trying to get the state department to grant the 
company an export license so it can aid israel in designing an 
airlaunched armorseeking eapon system 
but us officials have refused to issue the company the 
necessary license because they say the system would violate a 
sixyear ban on the sale of cluster bomb technology to israel 
in the memo from cr bergwin director of export license 
administration for united technologies to under secretary of state 
for security assistance science and technology the company argues 
that the ban should not apply to the 50 million contract 
in order that we may proceed with the program we urgently 
require an interpretation that the us governments cluster 
munition policy does not apply to our contract bergwin wrote 
he said the company believes that the 1982 ban was aimed at 
cluster bombs designed to be used against people not against tanks 
and armored vehicles 
the white house imposed the cluster bomb ban on israel in 1982 
after evidence surfaced that the devices were used by israel 
against civilians during its invasion of lebanon an apparent 
violation of assurances israel had previously given us officials

kiev residents who get a mysterious ache or pain 
are apt to grasp for the easy explanation radiation from 
chernobyl 
such is one of the lingering scars of the worlds worst nuclear 
accident a fear of what longterm health problems will result from 
the explosion and fire two years ago at the chernobyl nuclear 
plant 80 miles north of kiev the ukrainian capital 
a kiev resident speaking during a moscow visit on condition of 
anonymity said some people blame everything from headaches to 
toothaches on radiation from chernobyl this is despite the 
governments repeated assurances that radiation levels in the 
region are normal and safe 
doctors in accidentaffected regions are spending most of their 
time combating radiophobia the government newspaper izvestia 
reported in february 
a soviet pediatrician said last august that more than 2000 
healthy children were born to mothers who lived around chernobyl 
during the april 26 1986 disaster which killed 31 people and 
spewed a cloud of radioactivity worldwide 
but an american doctor who treated some chernobyl victims 
robert gale wrote april 1 in pravda that the accidents longterm 
effects cannot be predicted he guessed that problems could include 
birth defects genetic deviations and an additional 6000 cancer 
victims in the next 50 to 70 years 
although a pravda report on sunday criticized nepotism 
drunkenness and sloppy repairs at the plant other reports marking 
the disasters second anniversary portray life returning to normal 
they say chernobyls reactors are generating electricity again 
and people are living nearby in once dangerously radioactive areas 
but the fear of nuclear power remains 
taking advantage of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs 
campaign for glasnost or more openness on some issues nuclear 
power opponents have been speaking out and in some cases halting 
construction of new nuclear plants 
who will say that each of these atomic power stations built 
or planned does not conceal another potential chernobyl 
ukrainian writer oles honchar asked at a conference last october 
the governments answer one can say now with confidence that 
even a recurrence of the errors which were made in chernobyl would 
not lead to such a disaster nuclear power minister nikolai 
lukonin told the soviet news agency tass last week 
officials say the publics fears are unjustified plans call for 
doubling by 1990 the amount of electricity generated by nuclear 
plants from the 1985 level of 28 million kilowatts 
part of the increased production is from the chernobyl plant 
itself 
but the resumed production reportedly is not without its costs 
v lukyanenko the communist party head in slavutich a new town 
for plant workers 35 miles from chernobyl said last december that 
sloppy work poor discipline and safety violations at the plant 
contributed to 36 accidents over a 10month period three of them 
fatal 
yuri k semyonov deputy head of the chernobyl cleanup 
commission denied at a news conference last week that any major 
accident had occurred at the plant since the 1986 explosion 
last july three officials in charge of the plant during the 
accident were convicted of gross negligence and sentenced to 10 
years in a labor camp the government blamed the accident on human 
error in shutting down safety systems to conduct unauthorized 
experiments 
in january the ruling politburo put the accidents cost at 
138 billion 
another price paid was in peoples shaken faith in the 
governments ability to harness nuclear energy safely the 
newspaper komsomolskaya pravda said nuclear plants once lent 
prestige to a city but that was before chernobyl 
popular opposition has prevented building two nuclear plants 
near the ukrainian city of odessa and the byelorussian capital of 
minsk 
construction of a nuclear plant in the russian city of krasnodar 
was halted because residents complained it was in an 
earthquakeprone area and too close to a nature preserve 
public complaints appear to have been at least partly behind the 
governments may 1987 decision to stop building two additional 
reactors at chernobyl 
thirty ukrainian scientists writing jan 21 in the newspaper 
literaturnaya ukraina criticized on ecological grounds the 
governments plans to add reactors to three other plants they 
accused the government of ignoring the bitter lessons of 
chernobyl

uses deadly force when reasonably necessary according to 
federation president jerry preiser

president francois mitterrand has distanced himself 
from the modern french socialist party he founded and projected a 
new centrist image in his effort to defeat conservative premier 
jacques chirac in the may 8 runoff 
mitterrand is very much an insider in french politics despite 
his leftist label the bald avuncular incumbent is a veteran of 
four presidential elections has held many cabinet posts and enjoys 
one of the highest status symbols in french society as a former 
fighter in the world war ii resistance 
mitterrand 71 was first elected may 10 1981 in a socialist 
tidal wave that ousted centerright president valery giscard 
destaing a month later the same tide pushed out conservatives 
and centrists who had held power in the national assembly for 23 
years 
mitterrand also has known presidential defeat he was beaten by 
gen charles de gaulle in 1965 and by giscard in 1974 
but from 1981 to 1986 mitterrand and his socialists wielded 
political control in france 
that ended in the march 1986 legislative elections when voters 
returned rightists to power in the national assembly creating for 
two years what the french call cohabitation 
the socialists early freespending policies were abruptly 
reversed and stiff austerity measures instituted high unemployment 
also dragged down the presidents popularity to as low as 27 
percent at midterm 
with the socialist legislative defeat in 1986 mitterrand began 
to take on a new face 
he slipped into the role of elder statesman developing an image 
as the wise grandfather above the daytoday battles of governing 
he distanced himself from his party abandoned revolutionary 
rhetoric and began to reach out to the political center 
his popularity soared again consistently reaching an approval 
rate of 55 percent or more 
mitterrand was born oct 26 1916 in jarnac in western france 
he earned degrees in law and letters in paris he was drafted in 
1938 and shot and captured during the german invasion of may 1940 
escaping from a prisonerofwar camp in germany he returned to 
france the germans were occupying the vichy zone of france and 
mitterrand helped create a resistance network 
his careerlong feud with de gaulle began during the war when 
mitterrand refused to merge his resistance group with de gaulles 
it was also during his resistance days that he met danielle 
gouze whom he married in 1944 shortly after the liberation 
during the chaotic postwar fourth republic mitterrand held 11 
cabinet posts including interior and justice minister 
in the early 1970s mitterrand took the moribund socialist party 
and built it into a major force but the union of the left he 
forged with the communists fell apart in 1977 
it was not until the final days of the 1981 presidential 
election that the two major leftist parties again joined to defeat 
giscard and oust the conservatives 
mitterrand shocked much of the west when he brought communists 
into his government but that new union lasted only until 1984 when 
the communists pulled out in a dispute over economic policy

whatever artist andy warhol touched during his 
lifetime from brightly painted cookie jars to a 1974 rolls royce 
seems to have turned to gold by frenzied bidding at an auction of 
his collection of art and kitsch 
during the first two days of the 10day sale jewelry furniture 
and decorations owned by the late artist fetched 6222892 said 
diana levitt a spokeswoman for sothebys the auction house 
on sunday a pair of pottery cookie jars depicting a black chef 
and a black woman sold for 23100 about 200 times their 
estimated price 
the interest in the warhol collection is very high and were 
looking forward to eight more days of warhol interest and 
excitement she said 
saturdays sale featuring art nouveau and art deco pieces 
brought in 5314347 more than double what had been expected on 
sunday the bidding produced a total of 907995 three times more 
than estimated according to ms levitt 
warhols collection of paintings drawings and sculpture from 
19th century landscapes and portraits to a 1977 collage on paper by 
robert rauschenberg was scheduled to go on the block today 
people lined up around the block sunday to get into sothebys 
and more than 1000 packed the auction room during 4 hours of 
bidding said ms levitt 
the highest bid was 77000 by a beverly hills collector for a 
rollsroyce silver shadow sedan which had a presale estimate of 
15000 to 20000 she said 
the 175 cookie jars on sale projected to bring in 5000 to 
7000 fetched 247000 ms levitt said 
i think people felt they were interesting appealing amusing 
whimsical said ms levitt and the warhol factor was certainly 
at work in achieving these prices 
about 150 of the cookie jars were bought by gedalio grinberg 
chairman of movado watches which has developed a warhol watch that 
will be sold starting in september she added 
among the other sale items was a group of unmounted semiprecious 
stones mostly quartz which sold for 10000 10 times the 
presale estimate 
when a large golden hair ornament went for 1300 auctioneer 
david redden commented something actually sold in the 
estimates 
a series of john lennon lithographs signed in pencil by the 
late exbeatle sold for 10450 just over the presale estimate of 
7000 to 9000 the lithographs depict lennons marriage to yoko 
ono and their honeymoon 
a directors chair with warhols name on the back sold for 
6050 it was expected to bring only 100 to 150 
warhols collection of american classical and federal furniture 
called by sothebys the largest and most important available for 
auction in years will be sold tuesday 
before the sale began sothebys expected the entire collection 
to sell for 10 million to 15 million levitt said the high prices 
were attributable to some degree to the warhol factor but to a 
great degree the quality and rarity of the objects 
more than 10000 items including paintings rare art deco 
furniture watches clocks and photographs are included in one of 
the most extensive sales ever held by sothebys in new york 
proceeds will benefit the andy warhol foundation for the visual 
arts which will award grants to cultural institutions in the 
united states and abroad warhol died at age 58 last year

a group of brandeis university students 
has turned the addition of pork and shellfish to the student menu 
into a debate on the institutions jewish origins 
about 55 students demonstrated sunday against the menu items 
that go against kosher dietary laws protesters said shellfish and 
pork symbolized a desire by brandeis officials to pull away from 
the jewish identity of the 40yearold university 
the protesters in turn faced a counterdemonstration by students 
who said the antipork faction was exhibiting a hostility toward 
nonjews that has damaged brandeis reputation in the past 
brandeis and the administration is backing away from its 
jewish pride said protest organizer stuart kolisky 
claudia salomon agreed saying brandeis needs to retain that 
jewish quality it should be a diverse community but it should 
know that it has a jewish character 
michelle tankin who also is jewish engaged several of the 
protesters in a heated argument what youre trying to do is 
apply laws to people who arent kosher she said 
student adam whitehead held a small sign with the message 
dont discriminate against freedom to choose 
brandeis is officially nonsectarian but about 60 percent of 
the 2800 undergraduate enrollment is jewish the university has 
long offered nonkosher foods such as dishes that mix dairy 
products and meat 
the universitys board has no plans to change the pork and 
shellfish policy said sallie riggs spokeswoman for brandeis 
many of the comments that were made are either onesided or 
half the truth riggs said of the demonstrators she said about 
300 students are on the universitys kosher food plan and have a 
separate and newly expanded cafeteria 
riggs said the menu additions stemmed from a report by the 
universitys board last year on a range of issues among them was a 
desire to offer a menu compatible to all types of students for 
example shellfish and pork are major parts of the diet of asians 
riggs said 
one section of the report was titled a return to the 
historical nonsectarian emphasis of the university riggs said 
the report reflected the boards concern that the university was 
perceived as a jewish school 
it is not a religious school its not a jewish school its a 
nonsectarian university riggs said 
american studies professor jacob cohen supported the protest but 
acknowledged to the gathering this is very often and you know 
it a hostile and clannish and unfriendly place for those who are 
nonjewish 
still cohen said it was as important to avoid alienating jews 
who observe kosher laws cohen called the new food policy a 
statement by brandeis im a little bit ashamed of being jewish

when chirac faces mitterrand in the may 8 runoff the 
conservative premier will be challenging the president who 
appointed him one poll released sunday predicted mitterrand will 
win the runoff with 55 percent of the vote 
by finishing second sunday chirac improved on his first 
presidential run seven years ago he lost out in the first round in 
1981 finishing third behind former president valery giscard 
destaing and mitterrand 
chirac became premier in march 1986 when the conservatives 
ousted the socialists from control of the national assembly in 
legislative elections he then formed the new cabinet and was 
formally named premier by mitterrand 
chiracs conservative rally for the republic is the largest 
party in the centerright government coalition the energetic 
premier has at various times been compared to a bulldozer a 
computer and a robot 
while chiracs immense energy and ability to make tough 
decisions rapidly is considered a key asset critics consider it a 
liability there are those who feel he is too impulsive to be 
president 
chirac is simple in his tastes and acknowledges he likes western 
movies detective novels gin rummy and a good glass of beer he is 
the champion of a liberalized freemarket economy 
chirac was born nov 29 1932 in paris he was educated in the 
capital except during world war ii period and spent most of his 
holidays at the familys country home in the southcentral correze 
region 
after graduating from the institute for political studies in 
paris he fought as a lieutenant in the algerian war he completed 
his studies at the national school for administration whose 
graduates are destined for the top ranks of the civil service 
a frequent visitor to the united states chirac hitchiked around 
america as a youth working for a time as a fountain clerk at a 
howard johnson restaurant he was a protege of the late president 
georges pompidou who referred to him as my bulldozer 
chirac won his first election in 1967 a seat in the national 
assembly from the correze district he became a secretary of state 
in the finance ministry then moved on to be minister for relations 
with parliament agriculture minister and interior minister 
in 1974 at the age of 41 he became premier for the first time 
under giscard destaing 
chirac resigned after two years complaining of a lack of 
authority and disagreement over economic policy in 1977 he was 
elected mayor of paris a post he continues to hold 
instead of supporting giscard destaing in the runoff against 
mitterrand in the 1981 election chirac told his supporters to vote 
their conscience a move believed to have contributed to giscard 
destaings defeat and a source of bitterness between the centrists 
and conservatives

the old issues were blurred with ambivalence for 
some of the 60s revolutionaries who grappled with their past 
during a reunion at columbia university 
the adrenaline surge they remembered from the former struggle 
has been tempered by wistfulness perhaps because the dream didnt 
last 
it didnt just die it was profoundly defeated said tom 
hurwitz a freelance cinematographer who thought a majoritys greed 
overcame a minoritys ideals 
you become an anachronism and a very bitter one if youre 
not careful said bettina berch who was among the hundreds of 
former protesters who last weekend marked the 20th anniversary of a 
weeklong student uprising that shut down the ivy league campus 
one of the things that makes me sad is that people who are 
younger than us picked up on the drugs and forgot most of the rest 
of what we were saying said ann hunter 40 drugs were our 
biggest mistake 
during panel discussions a party and an indoor picnic they 
recalled how about 1000 people mostly students barricaded 
themselves inside five buildings the week of april 23 1968 the 
protest drew international attention to the issues of racism the 
vietnam war and the status quo in general 
this has plunged some of us into a lot of memories that one 
still feels ambivalent about said berch 
after college berch clung to her antiestablishment leanings 
she said she was kicked out of academia in a tenure fight after 
seven years of teaching at barnard college and is now writing a 
book 
in their own terms we were an aberration a time when they 
lost control she said we became very difficult creatures 
some people refused to discuss their feelings saying the 
reunion had brought back painful memories 
i remember seeing people i knew with arms in slings and heads 
in bandages said ann hunter now a law editor 
acting columbia college dean henry coleman was held hostage 
during the revolt professor orest ranum lost a decades research 
when a protester torched his files 
later ted gold a member of the radical weather underground 
was killed when a homemade bomb exploded in a greenwich village 
townhouse in 1970 david gilbert is serving a 75year prison 
sentence for his role in a 1981 armed car robbery 
at a panel discussion an audience of 500 applauded more 
youthful memories of the two men 
others chose to recall the lighter moments 
the wedding of andrea and richard egan in occupied fayerweather 
hall episcopal chaplain william starr crawled in through the 
window 
a pie tossed in the face of a marine colonel recruiting on 
campus 
mark naison now a historian taking his phd oral exam in a 
building that was under occupation he passed the exam and his 
professors left through a window 
there was a sense of real life real peace real happiness 
said hunter there was a feeling of opening up people engaging 
in real dialogue people who had gone around like little moles 
began to speak up 
there was incredible unity a kind of physical feeling 
agreed hurwitz it was a triumph of morality in a way that 
morality has rarely triumphed since 
its sort of sweet like people around the campfire said 
dave crebs 33 of boston about the reunion 
the returning alums opted for bluejeans or baggy corduroys a 
few teamed with ties and sports jackets a few with paunches there 
were plenty of smiles and embraces and buzzwords like the 
perversion of capitalism surfaced now and then 
up against the wall hollered members of the audience 
invoking the oncefamiliar phrase to request that a podium be moved 
away from the movie screen at a panel discussion 
they applauded abbie hoffman who wore a tiedied tshirt and 
sat in the front row a prominent bald spot and a red bandana 
adorning his frizzy gray hair 
hoffman had helped fuel the strikers conviction along with tom 
hayden h rap brown stokely carmichael william kunstler allen 
ginsberg and the grateful dead 
it was not a prank or a party although many have described it 
as the best time of their lives said mark rudd of albuquerque 
nm who was chairman of students for a democratic society in 1968

wildlife rescuers fear hundreds of more 
birds could be found coated in some of the 21000 gallons of crude 
oil that spilled along 10 miles of suisun bay 
more than 100 oilcovered birds and other wildlife were taken 
sunday to berkeley and walnut creek to be cleaned following 
saturdays spill just outside the northeastern reach of san 
francisco bay where it joins the sacramentosan joaquin delta 
rescuers said 
oil and marshes dont go together said al mcnabnay vice 
president of mount diablo audubon society its doomsday for the 
little birds and the big ones 
cleanup crews used vacuum trucks skimming boats and absorbent 
barriers at various sites to mop up the oil which began leaking 
into peyton slough and then suisun bay from drainage pipes leading 
to a storage tank at a shell co refinery 
workers mainly tried to contain the thick gooey slick in the 
slough and the adjacent shell marsh a bird habitat 
weve classified this as a major oil spill said capt david 
zawadzki of the coast guards marine safety office 
officials warned that the biggest threat to wildlife would come 
if any of the oil reached marshes on the northern side of the bay 
or wetlands along the san francisco bay 
if the oil reached the bay it would be virtually impossible to 
contain said capt ryan broddrick of the state fish and game 
department 
it would race up and down the bay with the tide and affect 
hundreds of miles of marshland he said 
the international berkeley bird center reported receiving 55 
ducks covered with oil they were expected to survive about 40 
birds received at the alexander lindsay museum in walnut creek also 
were in good condition said ms granados 
the museum also received two muskrats pond turtles ducks and a 
great blue heron a protected species 
jay holcomb spokesman for the berkeley center said he and 
others fear they will find hundreds more birds coated in oil today 
officials did not know how many birds have been found dead at 
the scene two were reported to have died at the rescue centers 
the spill occurred at the peak of the nesting season said state 
wildlife biologist bob wright 
the leak was quickly plugged said shell spokeswoman judith 
morad 
kgotv of san francisco quoted unidentified coast guard 
officials as saying the cleanup of boats and the marshes would cost 
at least 250000 and take several days

during a protest at the turkish consulate police said 
most of the demonstrators had been part of a crowd of 10000 who 
gathered earlier sunday at los angeles city college 
we cant change the tragedy that occurred 73 years ago under 
the ottoman empire but we can and we must change the way the world 
thinks about that genocide california lt gov leo mccarthy told 
the crowd 
vasken khodanian spokesman for the armenian human rights 
council said armenians want the turkish government to recognize 
the killings and compensate the survivors 
sen pete wilson rcalif told the crowd he has asked 
president reagan to discuss the plight of armenians during the 
summit with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev armenia is a republic 
of the soviet union 
let us hear no more of glasnost if gorbachev will not 
guarantee armenian rights let us not think that 1915 cannot happen 
again he said 
the los angeles armenian community of 200000 the largest 
outside the soviet union annually commemorates the massacre 
in new york more than 2000 people gathered in times square

declare april 24 as a day of remembrance and to get the us state 
department to drop the word alleged when referring to the 
armenian genocide said sam azadian a rally organizer 
mayor edward i koch told the crowd the truth is that there 
was an attempt by the ottoman turks to destroy the armenians and 
thank god they were not successful but the truth is they tried 
if we do not remember what happened to the armenians we will not 
remember what happened to the jews 
many survivors of the massacre were among the times square

when i was a little boy i remember the turks coming and taking 
everything from us manuelian said they took my father away

panamas staterun electric utility 
shut off power to a us embassy annex and the apartments of at 
least 45 of the embassys 180 workers for not paying their bills 
also sunday the civilian chief executive who replaced ousted 
president eric arturo delvalle named seven new cabinet members to 
confront the grave situation facing the nation 
workers from the hydraulic and electrical resources institute 
disconnected electrical meters at apartments of the embassy 
staffers whose power bills havent been paid in more than two 
months the state utility regularly cuts off power to consumers who 
do not pay their bills for two months 
the only difference here is that they did it on a sunday and 
they targeted it all very deliberately said terence kneebone a 
spokesman for the embassy any other business they normally 
would have done it on a workday 
they obviously said ok were going to take the gringos 
out kneebone said he said the embassy itself and the residence 
of ambassador arthur davis were left with power although the 
electric bills for those facilities also had not been paid 
two weeks ago the reagan administration ordered a ban on all 
payments to the government by us citizens and organizations 
however kneebone said the embassy which pays the rent and 
utility bills of its american employees stopped making payments 
even earlier at the request of delvalle whom the united states 
still recognizes as panamas president 
delvalle was deposed feb 26 one day after he tried to fire 
gen manuel antonio noriega the nations de facto leader as chief 
of panamas 15000member defense forces noriega is under 
indictment in us federal courts on charges of drug trafficking 
the united states also imposed economic sanctions on panama which 
led to a severe economic crisis in panama 
manuel solis palma who announced the new cabinet appointments 
sunday became the new chief executive after delvalles ouster 
solis palma said he would name new heads of some semiautonomous 
agencies and departments today 
all ministers and department chiefs offered their resignations 
to him last week the new ministers replace officials that solis 
palma inherited when he replaced delvalle 
solis palma said the primary goal of his new administrative team 
would be to reopen the nations banks closed since march 4 because 
of a lack of money to cover withdrawals by panicky depositors 
he named orville goodin as treasury minister barisnel espino as 
agriculture minister rolando murgas as education minister jorge 
ritter as foreign minister rene bultron as public works director 
gustavo gonzalez as head of planning and economic policy and cesar 
martans chief of labor and social welfare 
ricardo arias calderon president of the christian democratic 
party and a leading opposition figure said the changes appeared to 
be aimed at giving the administration legitimacy but i think it 
represents absolutely nothing really new for the public he 
added it remains an illegal government run by general noriega 
and nothing more than that

in cashstarved panama horacio icaza 
has added one of mankinds oldest forms of trade to his business 
skills he barters 
icaza whose firm casa del medico is the nations largest 
medical equipment supplier recently worked out a deal with the 
governmentowned water and power companies 
he pooled some of his employees water and electric bills then 
told the utilities he would erase a similar amount from the debts 
they owed his firm for laboratory equipment 
they agreed and debts on both side of the ledger were wiped out 
without any money changing hands 
panama suffering from sweeping us economic sanctions and the 
nearly twomonth closure of its onceformidable banking center has 
now become a barter economy 
it stops people from starving to death but it doesnt get the 
economy moving said a western european diplomat who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
panamanians have surpassed by much the traditional banking 
ability and capability of swiss bankers said former banker luis 
h moreno we have been able to do banking outside of banks 
panamas economic crisis was caused by the controversy 
surrounding gen manuel antonio noriega the nations military 
leader and the power behind the civilian government noriega is 
under federal indictment in the united states on drug trafficking 
and money laundering charges 
in a bid to oust noriega washington has cut off military and 
economic aid to panama frozen its assets in the united states and 
prohibited us companies and individuals from making payments to 
the government 
the sanctions combined with the closure of the banking system 
and a twoweek general strike in march have virtually paralyzed 
the economy 
the us dollar the national currency has become scarce 
its place has been partially filled by checks issued in small 
amounts by the government to pay its employees and social security 
recipients 
with those checks panamanians can buy groceries at supermarkets 
or clothing at department stores they also can send the checks 
back to the government to pay taxes or utility fees they owe the 
staterun water electric and telephone companies 
the checks say businessmen have become a quasicurrency 
late saturday afternoon the rodriguez family kept a close tab 
on the pricetags of the meat chicken cheese bread juice fish 
milk and eggs piled into a shopping basket at the rey supermarket 
on via espana 
they planned to fill the basket with food totaling 100 the 
amount of a social security check the elder rodriguez had received 
from the government the rey chain accepts government checks but 
gives no change on any unused portion 
on down the street blanca robles an english and art teacher 
used a 50 paycheck from the government to buy clothing at a 
department store which had sharply reduced the prices on much of 
its merchandise 
with the checks businesses can turn around and pay taxes 
duties or other fees owed the government all without dipping into 
scarce cash 
some of the savvy dealers approach people waiting to pay their 
utility bills offering to swap a government check for their cash 
still others offer to give government employees and retired 
people cash for their checks but at a discounted rate a 100 
check for example can bring 80 or so 
some corporate checks also have become a form of currency 
supermarkets have made arrangements to accept checks issued by 
their suppliers the suppliers pay their employees in 
smalldenomination checks which can be used to buy food or other 
necessities 
in a complicated arrangement the supermarkets then return the 
checks to the suppliers in payment against their accounts 
businessmen said

smiling and waving and wearing bows in her hiplength blond hair 
the clan espouses practices taught by early mormon leaders 
including multiple marriages which was abandoned by the mormon 
church in 1890 
federal agents have testified about gunfire they dodged during 
the standoff which came to a head when mrs singer and addam swapp 
responded to written entreaties from gov norm bangerter with dire 
prophecy and belligerence 
swapps letter denounced the government and the mormon church 
and declared the singer farm a nation independent and separate 
from your wicked society of everchanging laws and dark councils 
that seek to enslave the minds and souls of man 
the clan had buttressed its resolve with the belief that john 
singer husband of mrs singer and fatherinlaw of swapp would be 
resurrected when society collapsed 
singer was fatally shot in 1979 outside the farm after he 
brandished a gun at authorities trying to arrest him on warrants 
stemming from his refusal to send his children to public schools 
bucher swapps cocounsel says the familys beliefs must be 
considered 
the trial should be about the reasons and motivation of these 
people he said this case is simply not what its made out to 
be this is not a gang that got together to bomb a church 
still bucher isnt sure hell give in to his clients desire to 
testify he and the five other defense attorneys werent happy when 
adam swapp showed up for the trial wearing a beaded buckskin jacket 
emblazoned with the flag of early mormon pioneers 
the nine feathers hanging from the jacket reminiscent of the 
nine feathers on a spear left at the bombed chapel symbolize the 
nine years since john singers death 
john timothy singer in a statement to agents after his arrest 
said it was no coincidence the church was bombed two days before 
the anniversary of his fathers death he said it happened so 
that dads death would be recognized we could see there was no 
justice

only one man has been executed in israels 40year history 
adolf eichmann architect of the holocaust was hanged in 1962 
demjanjuk attended todays session in a wheelchair complaining 
of a bad back a christian he was seen making the sign of the 
cross and whispering to himself apparently praying during 
arguments from prosecutors who demanded the death penalty 
demjanjuks lawyers have said they will appeal his conviction to 
the supreme court 
several hundred onlookers crowded into the converted movie 
theater to hear the verdict earlier longtime observers said they 
expected the judges to sentence demjanjuk to death because of their 
sweeping guilty verdict which discounted each defense argument 
i believe a proven nazi war criminal definitely deserves to be 
put to death demjanjuks son 22yearold john jr told the 
associated press before the sentence was announced 
but they are not asking for a death penalty here they are 
asking for my father to be murdered because he is innocent the 
younger demjanjuk said chainsmoking and pacing nervously 
the ukrainianborn demjanjuk was found to be the guard ivan 
who ran the gas chambers at the treblinka death camp in 
nazioccupied poland some 800000 jews died in 1942 and 1943 when 
ivan worked at the camp 
demjanjuk has consistently alleged he is a victim of mistaken 
identity although he admitted lying on his american emigration 
papers about his past he contends he was held in a nazi prisoner 
of war camp during the critical period in question 
i am not ivan the terrible and to that god is the most just 
witness he knows i am innocent demjanjuk told the court today

secretary of state george p shultz 
today said nato faces a problem if denmark attempts to forbid us 
warships with nuclear arms from docking at its ports 
its up to all of us to measure up to our responsibilities 
shultz said after briefing the north atlantic council on his talks 
last week in moscow 
he acknowledged prospects were dim that the united states and 
the soviet union would conclude a treaty to halve their strategic 
nuclear arsenals in time for the may 29june 2 summit meeting in 
moscow 
its extremely difficult to get there shultz said at a news 
conference before flying home 
shultz said if a strategic arms reduction treaty start is not 
signed at the moscow summit the reagan administration would keep 
pushing in its twilight months for an accord well keep at it 
were not going to stop he said 
but he disputed suggestions that superpower relations had 
slumped since decembers signing of a treaty last year to ban 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles 
citing the soviet decision to withdraw an estimated 115000 
troops from afghanistan shultz said of eastwest relations i 
think the picture is one in which we see general progress 
after the session with the nato allies shultz met privately 
with uffe ellemannjensen the danish foreign minister to register 
his concerns over a danish parliament resolution that could bar 
us warships with nuclear arms from danish ports 
on april 14 danish socialists pushed a measure in parliament 
that required the government to tell visiting ships that nuclear 
arms are barred from danish ports in peacetime 
for 30 years denmark has barred such ships from its ports but 
the government avoided the provision by not asking ships if they 
were carrying nuclear arms 
after the vote denmarks centerright government which opposed 
the measure called for early elections on may 10 
ellemannjensen said we want to get a clear message from our 
voters they want denmark to remain a full member of the alliance 
denmark is one of the 16 members of the north atlantic treaty 
organization and among the leaders in pushing for nuclear 
disarmament negotiations with the soviet union 
ellemannjensen said he wants to end denmarks maverick position 
within the alliance if we get the signal from the voters we are 
asking for it will be possible to reach a fair solution 
such a solution would mean denmark sticks by its current ban on 
nuclear arms on its soil and simply expects visiting warships to 
respect that he said 
us and british warships as a matter of policy never divulge 
if their warships carry nuclear arms the danish resolution has led 
britain to suspend visits to denmark by royal navy vessels

conservative premier jacques chirac today received 
the backing of the centrist union for french democracy in his 
uphill battle to defeat socialist president francois mitterrand in 
the presidential runoff may 8 
chirac a 55yearold neogaullist finished a distant second in 
firstround voting sunday to mitterrand who is seeking a second 
sevenyear term 
chirac picked up the support of the centrist partys leader 
64yearold raymond barre sunday night shortly after polls closed 
barre a former premier finished third in the voting 
the union for french democracy formally endorsed chirac today 
but it was not known how many of its supporters would vote for 
chirac exit polls showed many members of the centrist party might 
support mitterrand in the runoff 
i support him in his fight said barre of chirac and i 
ask all those who voted for me to vote for him in the second 
round 
however barre did not write chirac a blank check i count on 
him to defend the objectives to which we are particularly attached 
an open and tolerant society that rejects xenophobia racism and 
extremism barre said 
his comments were aimed at the candidate of the extreme right 
jeanmarie le pen who finished just behind barre and whose 
endorsement could be key to a chirac victory 
le pen president of the national front won 145 percent of the 
vote well above predictions his campaign speeches included calls 
for deporting immigrants and quarantining victims of acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome 
a cartoon in the leftist daily liberation today showed le pen 
dressed as a stormtrooper standing inside chiracs open mouth and 
saying from now on nothing in this country gets done without 
me 
in an editorial liberation editor serge july wrote two years 
under mitterrand have multiplied discontent with chirac le pen has 
systematically welcomed this once again making france an 
exceptional democracy the only one in the western world where 
the economic and political crisis has engendered an extremist 
electorate 
le pen 59 said he will tell his supporters at a rally on 
sunday how to vote on may 8 
an editorial in the conservative daily le figaro today said the 
task of attracting le pen followers without alienating barres 
constituents was difficult but not impossible 
the right has no reason to call this a lost cause as long as 
chirac can rally around him all the men and women in this country 
who dont want mitterrands reelection le figaro said 
with 98 percent of the vote counted on sunday the 71yearold 
mitterrand had 339 percent ahead of chirac who with 199 percent 
did not do as well as expected barre was third with 166 percent 
a telephone poll conducted by staterun antenne 2 television 
after the results were announced showed that mitterrand would 
defeat chirac in the runoff winning 55 percent of the vote 
in a brief statement mitterrand said on sunday now the 
choice is simple to all of you who serve france we have great 
tasks before us let us rally together neglecting no effort to win 
may 8 
the communist party once a significant political force slumped 
to its lowest score in party history with andre lajoinie getting 
68 percent 
rounding out the ninecandidate field were antoine waechter an 
ecologist with 38 percent pierre juquin leader of a splinter 
communist reformist group 21 percent arlette laguiller head of 
the trotskyist worker strggle movement 2 percent and pierre 
boussel leader of another trotskyist group 04 percent turnout by 
frances 38 milion voters was more than 82 percent 
the choice facing french voters may 8 is more over what kind of 
president they want rather than the positions of the two candidates 
this is mitterrands fourth presidential race he was defeated 
by gen charles de gaulle in 1965 and by valery giscard destaing 
in 1974 before winning in 1981 
chirac a smiling energetic campaigner heads the neogaullist 
rally for the republic party 
he has run the government since the right won the legislative 
elections in 1986 in what the french call cohabitation with a 
leftist president 
the president is the chief of state the premier elected by the 
legislature is the head of government sundays vote marked the 
first time a president and premier have opposed one another in a 
presidential election 
discussion in the next few days is likely to focus on a date and 
format for a televised mitterrandchirac debate mitterrand has 
suggested thursday chirac wants a date in the final week of the 
campaign 
a debate is vastly more important to chirac who hopes it will 
help him make up ground against the president 
on the issues both candidates support an open economy and want 
to improve frances education system spending more on technical 
training and research 
on foreign and defense policies both speak of the need for 
france to become more involved in europes defenses

facilities 
under the agreement cls partsdistribution workers will remain 
on the job even if the uaw and caterpillar dont reach a master 
contract agreement by sept 30 and even if manufacturing workers 
decide to strike

a lawyer for a former crewman who was 
acquitted in the killings of eight people aboard a fishing boat 
said the mans family may file suit because of the fouryear ordeal 
that became the most expensive criminal case in alaska history 
john kenneth peel was acquitted saturday of eight counts of 
firstdegree murder and one count of firstdegree arson in the 1982 
deaths aboard the investor he had been tried twice the first 
trial resulted in a hung jury 
its terrible being an innocent man accused of a crime peel 
said i just thank god its over justice did work this time 
peel a boatbuilder from bellingham wash who once crewed on 
the investor was accused of killing skipper mark coulthurst his 
wife irene two coulthurst children and four teenage crew members 
the coulthursts were from blaine wash and three crew members 
were from the blainebellingham area 
the investor was found burning near the southeastern alaska town 
of craig in september 1982 and peel was not arrested until two 
years after the crime 
from the moment it was issued i have always said the 
indictment was not worth the paper it was written on said 
defense attorney phillip weidner 
the prosecutors put an innocent man and his family through 
this ordeal for four years weidner said adding that the family 
is considering a lawsuit to seek restitution but he declined to 
say who might be the target of such a suit 
on saturday peel 27 broke into tears and his family cheered 
when the jury announced its decision in juneau superior court his 
family had been with him throughout the threemonth trial with 
financial support from friends and family in bellingham 
on the advice of his attorney peel did not answer any 
questions he and his wife cathy declined comment on what they 
might do next 
were going to have no place to go but up from here mrs 
peel said 
prosecutor mary anne henry who handled both trials told jurors 
the state had bungled the investor investigation had no evidence 
of a motive and no physical evidence against peel 
nonetheless she contended the prosecution could prove its case 
based on witnesses who said they saw peel near the investor around 
the time of the killings and in the fishing vessels skiff after 
the larger boat was found burning in a cove near craig 
peel was working on another fishing boat docked in craig at the 
time 
peels brotherinlaw jack perram said peel can return to a 
job at perrams bellingham boatyard 
im sort of like a zombie said peels mother marilyn peel 
its been a long three days since the jury went out 
relatives of the victims said they were disappointed 
somebody ought to pay said ted smith who was related to 
five of those slain i dont say it should have been peel but it 
should have been somebody 
i thought after being up there for a couple of weeks watching 
the trial that they would find him guilty as they should have 
said ruth moon mother of slain crew member dean moon who was at 
her home in bellingham 
the state spent 2 million on the investigation and on peels 
first trial and budgeted 700000 for the retrial the defense 
rested its case the second time without calling any witnesses 
i didnt put a case on because there was no need to dignify 
this case by putting on witnesses said weidner 
jury deliberations began wednesday evening the jury forewoman 
said members of the panel had agreed not to talk to reporters 
peel had been in his parents custody on a 1 million property 
bond since his arrest in september 1984

us ambassador mike mansfield today called on 
japan to join in dropping trade barriers and contribute more to its 
own defense 
mansfields remarks came two days after japanese farmers smashed 
and burned an american car torched boxes of us oranges and set 
fire to a us flag in a rally in western japan the estimated 300 
farmers were protesting us demands that japan end its 
restrictions on imported beef and oranges 
for two hours today mansfield answered questions at the 
invitation of a foreign affairs and defense committee of the 
japanese legislature 
the former us senator a specialist in international affairs 
was asked by committee chairman takenori kato of the governing 
liberal democratic party about the agricultural issues that have 
embroiled the two countries in disputes since the quota system on 
beef and oranges officially expired april 1 
mansfield said the united states does not want to destroy the 
agricultural economy of any country he urged both nations to work 
toward developing a world market for food to take care of starving 
people 
also during todays questioning mansfield promoted his proposal 
to include japan in a free trade agreement which is intended to 
remove trade barriers between the united states and japan and put 
them on an equal footing 
but he acknowledged that neither country had shown any interest 
in the plan mansfield said the prospect looks very bleak 
indeed for such an accord even though the united states is 
working on similar proposals with israel and mexico 
however he said handling trade problems on an issuebyissue 
basis only increases the dangers of retaliation misunderstanding 
and the like 
mansfield said an intermediaterange nuclear weapons agreement 
under review by the us senate would put more pressure on nations 
to strengthen their conventional forces at a time when the world is 
already too heavily armed and too much money is being spent on 
weapons 
although he said he wants japan to help share the military 
burden he said he does not want japan to violate its constitution 
which prohibits military action other than defense 
he said the united states is no longer in a position to carry 
the burden of defending other nations as it did after world war ii 
but he also said us economic woes have been problems of our 
own doing and he called on japan to help 
mansfield said he would like to see a purely economic union 
created in the pacific basin

the average price of gasoline nationwide 
jumped 267 cents to nearly a dollar a gallon in the past two weeks 
in what is seen as a precursor to even higher prices during the 
summertime peak driving season 
we have a dramatic leap in the retail price of gasoline across 
the nation trilby lundberg said sunday after compiling results 
of the lundberg survey of prices at 12000 gas stations in every 
state the latest twoweek survey ended april 22 
the average price of 9884 cents includes all grades and sales 
categories as well as taxes 
the greatest increases were found in the midwest the smallest 
in the rocky mountains region ms lundberg said 
prices per gallon at selfservice pumps were regular unleaded 
8990 cents premium unleaded 10445 cents regular leaded 8686 
cents 
at fullserve pumps prices were regular unleaded 11874 
cents premium unleaded 12881 cents regular leaded 11414 cents 
theres a mixed bag of indicators for future trends because 
although wholesale prices to all types of retailers are still on 
the rise our spot price surveys show great variation with drops 
and hikes in the main trading centers ms lundberg said 
crude oil prices meanwhile are holding and a good 
guesstimate might be that if they continue to hold gasoline prices 
to motorists could continue to rise moderately in coming months in 
response to summer demand she said 
ms lundberg noted that most price change usually occurs at 
selfservice pumps but the latest survey showed activity at 
fullserve pumps 
this is a real push upward because the wholesale buying price 
increases that the retailers paid in the past couple of weeks were 
burdens they had to pass on and they did she said

of los angeles to sell two chinese companies technology to produce 
phosphoric acid 
hammer 89 refused to disclose the dollar value of the new 
projects and insisted occidental is not losing money on the 800 
million antaibo coal mine in north china the largest and most 
highprofile uschinese joint venture 
occidental has a 25 percent share in the mine 230 miles 
southwest of beijing in shanxi province 
it opened with great fanfare in september but has been operating 
well below capacity because of mechanical problems and disputes 
with the chinese partners over the price at which the coal should 
be sold 
we consider the problems we have had there minor problems 
hammer told a news conference after signing the two new contracts 
at beijings luxious diaoyutai state guesthouse

hammer said we dont figure weve lost anything 
he insisted the mine can be profitable once it begins producing 
at its capacity of 15 million tons of raw coal per year even if 
coal prices dont recover from their current low of about 20 per 
ton 
chinas official xinhua news agency recently reported design 
problems with the mines washing plant which it said left too much 
moisture in the coal it blamed the mines low production level on 
the washing plant problem 
there also have been reports of personal feuding between the 
occidental and chinese technical staff at the mine 
hammer said his current visit to china was not a 
troubleshooting one 
im not here because of those problems he said they are 
being straightened out without me i came because the chinese have 
invited me to celebrate my 90th birthday hammer turns 90 on may

that he plans to bring up the subject of selling coal

sales of existing homes rose 25 percent in 
march the second consecutive monthly increase in response to 
falling mortgage interest rates a real estate trade group said 
monday 
the national association of realtors said existing singlefamily 
homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted rate of 333 million units 
last month 
lower interest rates have stimulated activity and the first 
quarter has turned out better than we anticipated john a

rates for 30year fixedrate mortgages which had risen above 
115 percent before the october stock market crash edged below 10 
percent in february and march they have been rising in april and 
were 103 percent last week 
the increase in march followed an identical 25 percent rise in 
february and three consecutive monthly declines before that 
however the sales level was still 98 percent below levels last 
year when interest rates were at a nineyear low 
tuccillo said he expected home sales to rise again this month 
the sales increase was accompanied by a 41 percent rise in 
prices to a median or midpoint of 88700 up from 88100 in 
february 
sales were led by a 96 percent advance in the west and a 67 
percent boost in the south sales were unchanged in the northeast

chinese communist party chief zhao ziyang said 
today that china will deal forcefully with separatist movements 
such as the one in tibet and that such movements are doomed to 
failure 
nowadays a very small number of people are attempting to 
split our motherland zhao said at a conference of 4000 people 
representing chinas 56 nationalities 
it is not difficult to see that they are not representing the 
interests of our people and they are only the agents of some 
antichinese foreign forces their vain attempt of splitting china 
cannot possibly be realized 
zhao did not mention tibet by name but it was clear that he was 
referring to the faraway province 
the tibetan capital of lhasa erupted in proindependence riots 
last fall and again in march the bloody protests were led by 
buddhist monks loyal to the exiled spiritual leader the dalai lama 
tibetan authorities have allowed almost no foreign journalists 
into tibet and released few details of action taken against 
rioters sources in lhasa have reported hundreds of arrests 
following the march disturbance chinese officials say five people 
died in the march riots unconfirmed reports have put the death 
toll as high as 24 
zhao said china must carry out a twopronged policy to promote 
the interests of minority nationalities and forcefully oppose and 
deal with any separatist efforts his comments were carried by 
the official xinhua news agency 
zhao told the gathering that discrimination against minority 
ethnic groups is a problem everywhere in the world except china 
he claimed china has banned discrimination against minorities 
protects them by law and grants them privileges not available to 
han chinese who comprise 92 percent of chinas 1 billion people 
chinese minorities which include 55 ethnic groups were often 
the victims of persecution during the first three decades of 
communist rule in china when the government tried to eliminate 
religious worship and local languages and customs 
in the past decade beijing has tried to redress some of the 
wrongs of the past and now encourages minorities many who live in 
sparsely populated strategic areas of western china to retain 
their traditions 
zhao is the author of a plan to give priority to economic 
development of coastal china 
there has been concern that zhaos plan would further widen the 
income gap between the coast which is mostly han chinese and the 
interior where many minorities live in pockets of poverty 
zhao urged minorities to use foreign capital science and 
technology to develop their economies and compete in national and 
international markets

former vice president spiro t agnew lost a 
supreme court appeal today in a lawsuit alleging he was cheated out 
of more than 2 million for arranging a deal between a defense 
contractor and the argentine government 
the justices without comment refused to order the setting 
aside of more than 340000 in a special fund agnew and another 
businessman would receive if they win the lawsuit 
agnew an international business consultant charged in a 1986 
suit filed in federal court in new york city that he was cheated 
out of a commission he earned for winning a telecommunications 
contract for aydin corp of delaware 
agnew said aydin corp and alicanto sa an argentine company 
retained him to help open doors in 1980 with the argentine ruling 
military junta 
his suit said alicanto was to recieve a 15 percent commission 
from aydin and then pay agnew between onethird and onehalf that 
amount more than 2 million 
but agnew alleged that alicanto instead paid a 365 million 
bribe to a bagman who passed it on to argentine air force gen 
lami dozo to help win the contract 
agnew said alicanto then lied to him claiming the deal fell 
through when in fact aydin won a 57 million contract to provide a 
microwave communications system to the argentine air force 
agnew and william h woolverton jr a former vice president of 
alicanto are suing alicanto and its president william h shaw 
us district judge jack b weinstein last year refused to order 
alicanto and shaw to place more than 340000 in a fund that would 
go to agnew and woolverton if they win their suit 
in their appeal to the supreme court agnew and woolverton said 
alicantos assets now may be moved out of the united states and 
most likely out of argentina so that they will be out of reach of 
any court judgment 
agnew elected vice president in 1968 when richard m nixon 
headed the republican ticket resigned in 1973 after he was accused 
of accepting bribes and kickbacks while a baltimore county 
executive in maryland 
he pleaded no contest to tax evasion in that case 
agnew said in his suit against alicanto and shaw that he was 
cheated out of the commission by people who believed his past 
reputation would bar him from winning any case in court 
agnew said he was told by a lawyer who worked for aydin that 
nobody would believe him if he sued because of prior events 
related to his holding public office 
the case is agnew vs alicanto 871464

tensions over indian fishing rights 
rose as about 60 protesters carrying signs and an american flag 
harassed chippewa spearfishers on a northern wisconsin lake 
if they spearfishing opponents keep up what theyre doing 
theyre going to have spears in them tom maulson a lac du 
flambeau tribal judge and spearfishing organizer said sunday 
a department of natural resources official said the tension at 
big arbor vitae lake was increased by the presence of a republican 
congressional candidate the candidate kevin hermening said the 
controversy is an issue of citizenship 
we cant have separate rights for special groups of people 
based on age gender or race hermening told the cheering 
protesters sunday night 
the indians right to spearfish in offreservation lakes has 
been upheld in federal court but protesters say the fishing 
damages stocks and hurts sportfishing a major industry here 
the crowd traded verbal jabs with indians and wardens from the 
great lakes indian fish and wildlife commission took a boat out on 
the water to count measure and record the sex of fish rather than 
face possible confrontation when they were brought to shore 
counting fish on the water may well avoid another time of a 
possible confrontation said george meyer dnr chief 
administrator of enforcement he said spearfishing opponents become 
more upset and vocal when fish are counted 
state wardens planned to cite one of about 15 nonindian boats 
on the lake with causing a hazardous wake said meyer officials 
also were considering whether to cite the boater with harassment 
no one was injured in the incident meyer said 
an indian report of a gunshot heard on catfish lake in vilas 
county was turned over to the county sheriffs department for 
investigation said dale urso dnr northcentral district director 
this was the fourth year the chippewa have exercised their 
right retained in 19th century treaties to harvest resources in 
northern wisconsin lands ceded to the united states 
protests have been violent in previous years including shots 
fired at some lakes in 1986 no serious injuries have been 
reported and a cadre of officers aided by a national guard chopper 
is helping keep the peace this year 
each indian band is allowed 15 days of spearing and may take no 
more than 20 percent of what biologists figure a lakes fish 
population can tolerate the season ends may 6 
the indians fish at night using lanterns to help them find 
fish which they catch with spears up to eight feet long 
protesters say this is an unfair way to fish 
meyer attributed the number of nonindian boats on big arbor 
vitae and some of the tension to the organized protest and 
hermenings presence 
he said there was a marked difference in the tension after 
hermening returned from a boat ride to address the crowd 
his presence increased the size of the crowd and in 
particular some of his discussion after the boat came back in in 
my mind did increase some of the tension meyer said

soviet industrial production increased by 5 
percent in the first three months of 1988 as reforms requiring many 
factories and firms to operate on a selfsustaining basis went into 
effect radio moscow said today 
the official radio said nikolai belov deputy head of the state 
committee on statistics reported the production increase exceeded 
the 45 percent target set in state plans 
however it said production targets have not been met as 
regards a number of major commodities and the quality of many of 
the goods is still substandard 
the brief report did not specify the problem areas of the 
economy or areas of success 
it said the national income increased by 4 percent national 
income is a measurement of economic activity that differs from 
gross national product in not considering the value of some 
services 
as of jan 1 staterun factories and farms responsible for 60 
percent of the soviet unions production were required to depend on 
themselves for the revenue they need to operate 
that is one of the key elements of mikhail s gorbachevs 
economic reforms which are aimed at giving local managers more 
responsibility and flexibility the communist party general 
secretary wants to limit central authorities to overall planning of 
the economy rather than exercising direct control over the 
production plans and quotas of factories and farms 
industries and farms operating under the new requirements are 
performing better than those working in the old way radio moscow 
said 
the radio report came as us intelligence agencies in 
washington released a report saying gorbachevs reforms ran into 
serious obstacles in 1987 
a joint report by the central intelligence agency and the 
defense intelligence agency said the soviet gross national product 
increased only 05 percent in 1987 compared with a 39 percent 
increase the previous year 
it cited the poor performance in 1987 to poor weather that hurt 
farm production and resistance to change in the soviet bureaucracy

the supreme court today agreed to consider 
giving federal prison wardens more power to decide what 
publications inmates may read 
the court said it will review a ruling that limits the authority 
of officials to censor reading material behind prison bars 
one of the prisoners in the case is jack henry abbott a 
convicted murderer and bank robber who achieved notoriety after he 
was befriended by norman mailer and other prominent writers and 
editors 
six weeks after abbott was freed in a workrelease program in 
1981 he stabbed to death an aspiring actor outside of a new york 
city restaurant where the victim was working as a waiter abbotts 
book on prison life in the belly of the beast was critically 
acclaimed 
abbott is among prisoners who challenged federal regulations 
restricting publications that may be sent to inmates 
the us circuit court of appeals here ruled last july that the 
rules go too far in giving wardens control over what publications 
inmates may subscribe to or receive 
the appeals court ordered further trial court hearings where 
officials will have to prove that 46 publications should be banned 
because they threaten security order or rehabilitation 
the freeexpression rights of inmates require that officials 
shoulder the burden of proof when they seek to ban publications 
the appeals court said 
among the publications officials tried to ban were for example 
an issue of the call a leftwing newspaper that included an 
article charging inhumane treatment by racist guards in 
federal prisons 
officials at a federal penitentiary in atlanta said the article 
is considered not to be in the best interest of discipline good 
order and security 
but the appeals court said that is an insufficient reason to ban 
the publication the officials failed to prove the material 
encouraged conduct which would constitute or otherwise was likely 
to produce a breach of security or order or an impairment of 
rehabilitation 
the same limits on official power should apply to sexually 
explicit material the appeals court said 
also the appeals court said censoring parts of a publication is 
less restrictive than banning the newspaper or magazine entirely 
rejecting an entire publication where a part is objectionable is 
inconsistent with the first amendment the appeals court said 
the constitutions first amendment ensures freedom of speech 
the reagan administration urged the supreme court to restore 
fully the prison regulations 
while a warden may have a legitimate fear that a particular 
publication will cause problems he will rarely be able to prove a 
likelihood of violence or disorder as a result of the admission of 
a publication justice department lawyers said 
they cited uprisings last year by inmates from cuba in two us 
prisons as evidence that information from the outside can in 
some circumstances have grave consequences within a prison 
the government also argued that the number of publications 
excluded is small 
between sept 1 1986 and aug 31 1987 some 1728 publications 
were withheld out of 18 million sent to federal inmates the 
governments appeal said 
the groups challenging the prison regulations are the prisoners 
union weekly guardian associates and the revolutionary socialist 
league 
the case is meese vs abbott 871344

williams college administrators 
resumed talks today with protesters who are occupying a deans 
office and demanding more attention to the education of racial 
minorities 
talks began at 7 am barely six hours after negotiators broke 
from a previous meeting college spokesman james kolesar said 
the two sides had met for two hours sunday afternoon with 
williams president francis c oakley taking part then reconvened 
at 915 pm and talked into the early morning hours 
representatives of both sides called the sunday talks 
constructive 
the students members of a group called the coalition against 
racist education took over the jenness house on friday morning and 
issued 13 demands that included the hiring by the prestigious 
liberal arts school of more minority faculty members and the 
admitting of more minority students while incorporating more 
minority perspectives into the curriculum 
theyre responsive to us said one of the student 
negotiators monique waddell 19 a sophomore from new york city 
referring to the administration representatives that included dean 
stephen fix and provost neil grabois 
the meeting is showing some progress she said theres 
not a sense of negativity the energy that is flowing is 
constructive so thats good 
she added its just a matter of getting them to understand us 
better 
the talks were conducted in the physics building adjacent to 
the jenness house 
minority students comprise 13 percent of the 2000member 
student body the protesters include students from asia the 
caribbean and the pacific islands as well as american blacks and 
hispanics 
about 10 percent of the 278member faculty belongs to a minority 
group 
sunday administration officials and the protesters discussed 
three of the demands these were establishing full scholarships 
for lowincome minority students from urban areas creating a 
campus cultural center for minority groups and hiring a special 
assistant to the president to recruit more minority teachers 
school spokesman jim kolesar said the administration would not 
comment specifically on the talks but he called the discussions 
constructive 
while the negotiations were under way a young white man was 
seen taping a sign saying quality not quotas on a window at 
jenness with the words facing inside the house it was later 
removed 
freshman jillian charles who spent saturday night inside the 
house said she heard rocks being thrown at the building 
jenness house which serves as the deans office while the main 
administration building is being renovated is tucked in a corner 
of the campus making the protest less conspicuous while some of 
the hundreds of parents visiting over the parents weekend 
expressed concern and even support for the protest they largely 
spent the weekend undisturbed by it said ellen berek news 
director for the school

the supreme court today let stand a ruling 
that property owners rights are not violated when they are 
required to remove structures that could interfere with lowflying 
planes 
the court citing the lack of a substantial federal 
question rejected an appeal by a cheyenne wyo man fined 200 
a day for refusing to trim a 48foot cottowood tree on his property 
terry rogers the tree owner said a cheyenne ordinance imposing 
a height limit on structures near the local airport is 
unconstitutional because it takes property without just 
compensation 
his tree at 48 feet would have to be cut to 25 or 30 feet to 
comply with the ordinance rogers said that would kill the tree 
costing him 2064 
after he lost an earlier challenge to the ordinances 
constitutionality rogers was found guilty of violating city law 
and fined 200 a day beginning nov 20 1986 
court documents did not indicate the total fine assessed against 
rogers 
the wyoming supreme court last december upheld the fine 
rejecting claims that the air space above rogers property belonged 
to him 
the state court also rejected rogers argument that because the 
tree was in place prior to enactment of the ordinance he was 
entitled to keep it 
the state court said the local law allows for the continuance 
of a nonconforming use it does not allow the expansion of a 
preexisting nonconforming use 
in other words the state court said a violation occurred 
if the tree was allowed to grow higher than it stood in october 
1974 when the ordinance was adopted 
the tree has grown some 18 feet since the fall of 1974 the 
state court said 
the justices in 1986 rejected a related appeal by rogers 
the case is rogers vs cheyenne 871462

not hiring enough women as highway maintenance workers 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by state 
officials who said lower courts improperly weighed the evidence 
the justices also refused to hear an appeal by women who said 
remedies ordered by the lower courts were inadequate 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals last september said there 
was adequate evidence for a federal jury to find that the missouri 
highway and transportation commission discriminated against women 
in the states eighth district 
the verdict was based partly on anecdotal evidence and partly on 
statistics that showed the number of women maintenance workers in 
the district was a small fraction of the women in the regional work 
force 
the appeals court said that from jan 1 1975 through may 31 
1980 the state hired eight women as maintenance workers and 89 men 
for those jobs 
during that period women comprised up to 48 percent of the work 
force the appeals court noted 
missouri officials interpreted the statistics differently they 
said only 312 women applied for maintenance work compared to 3566 
men during that period the state said it hired 26 percent of the 
female applicants and 25 percent of the men who applied 
but the 8th circuit court said the equal hiring rate did not 
prove the state was innocent of bias 
a judge and jury were free to weigh the inference of 
nondiscrimination arising from the hiring rate against the 
inference of discrimination arising from the anecdotal and 
statistical evidence the appeals court said it added the 
evidence was sufficient to support a verdict that the state 
engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination against 
women 
the appeals court upheld a ruling that some 150 women may share 
in back pay to be awarded by the state the group is made up of 
women who were qualified to be hired as maintenance workers if the 
state had not discriminated on the basis of sex 
but the appeals court overturned a portion of a federal judges 
ruling that missouri hire from 37 percent to 48 percent women for 
future maintenance worker openings 
the 8th circuit court ordered the hiring goal replaced by a 
generalized injunction prohibitng further discrimination against 
women 
the appeals court also refused to order the state to hire four 
women who were among the first to charge the state with 
discrimination and it declined to extend its ruling beyond the 
eighth district to make it statewide 
the mountain states legal foundation a conservative group and 
officials from wisconsin and wyoming said the finding of 
discrimination against missouri could have farreaching 
consequences 
they said the charges were based on questionable statistical 
evidence the eligible work force consisted of all working women 
between ages 18 and 70 who had drivers licenses and an eighth 
grade education they noted 
this labor pool is too broad because it failed to consider 
only those individuals willing and able to do the work in 
question they said 
the cases are missouri highway commission vs catlett 871415 
and catlett vs missouri highway commission 871416

an israeli court today sentenced john demjanjuk 
to be executed for war crimes committed as ivan the terrible a 
sadistic nazi guard who ran gas chambers where about 800000 jews 
died 
he was a chief hangman who with his own hands killed tens of 
thousands with cruelty we sentence him to death said judge 
zvi tal onlookers clapped and shouted as the sentence was 
announced some chanted bravo others shouted death death 
last week the court convicted the 68yearold retired ohio 
autoworker of nazi war crimes it said he was responsible for the 
deaths of thousands of jews at the treblinka concentration camp in 
nazioccupied poland about 800000 jews died in 1942 and 1943 
when ivan worked at the camp 
only one man has ever been executed in israels 40year history 
adolf eichmann architect of the holocaust was hanged in 1962 
court spokesman yossi hassin said demjanjuk would most likely be 
hanged if the sentence is upheld on appeal the expectation is 
he would be hanged hassin said 
demjanjuk attended todays sentences in a wheelchair 
complaining of back problems he entered the courtroom moments 
before the verdict was read shouting in hebrew i am innocent 
a christian he was seen making the sign of the cross and 
whispering to himself apparently praying during arguments from 
prosecutors who demanded the death penalty 
after the verdict he was wheeled away expressionless and ringed 
by riot police 
demjanjuks lawyers have said they will appeal his conviction to 
the supreme court todays sentence followed a trial that lasted 14 
months 
yosef czarny a treblinka survivor who testified against 
demjanjuk said that although a thousand deaths cannot compensate 
for what happened at least we have judged one of the angels of 
death 
i feel like a burden has been lifted said pinchas epstein 
another holocaust survivor 
tals statement after three hours of judicial deliberation drew 
applause and whistling from hundreds of israelis in the audience 
including survivors of the holocaust 
several hundred onlookers crowded into the converted movie 
theater to hear the verdict earlier longtime observers said they 
expected the death penalty because of the sweeping guilty verdict 
which discounted each defense argument 
there is no forgiveness in the law or the heart 
holocaust victims are still crying out to us said tal who was 
born in poland even a thousand deaths cannot compensate 
demjanjuks son 22yearold john jr said his family had 
expected a death sentence 
it amounts to nothing less than the judicial murder of an 
innocent man he said it will bring shame to the state of 
israel the israeli justice department the us justice 
department and most unfortunately the six million victims of the 
nazi holocaust 
earlier in the day his father told the threejudge panel it was 
making a very very very big mistake 
the ukrainianborn demjanjuk has consistently alleged he is a 
victim of mistaken identity although he admitted lying on his 
american emigration papers about his past he contends he was held 
in a nazi prisoner of war camp during the critical period in 
question 
i am not ivan the terrible and to that god is the most just 
witness he knows i am innocent demjanjuk told the court today 
he spoke in ukrainian 
the court adjourned briefly after demjanjuk spoke to allow the 
judges time to consider the arguments 
the defense also had pleaded against a death sentence 
there is also a question of an individuals holocaust said 
defense attorney john gill of cleveland the taking of any 
innocent human life is a holocaust 
opening the proceedings today prosecutor yona blattman told the 
three judges that demjanjuk was not a small cog in the nazi 
machine he was a major criminal an archhenchman 
we maintain the only punishment that can be imposed on the 
accused is the death penalty blattman argued 
demjanjuk pointed to his chest shaking his head no as blattman 
alleged that demjanjuk had distinguished himself by the sheer 
brutality of his behavior beating jews mercilessly with a sword 
or whip 
gill said the conviction could be shown at a later date to have 
been incorrect and he cited previous wrongful convictions the 
problem with the death penalty he said is that it is in fact 
irrevocable 
in its verdict last week the tribunal convicted demjanjuk 
without hesitation or doubt of being the brutal guard at 
treblinka 
the three judges said demjanjuk killed masses of human beings 
with his own hands frequently exceeding the brutality ordered by 
nazi commanders 
nazi war crimes and terrorism are the only offenses punishable 
by death in the jewish state 
during the trial five holocaust survivors identified demjanjuk 
of suburban cleveland as the nazi guard who operated treblinkas 
gas chambers 
justice minister avraham sharir had urged the death penalty for 
demjanjuk saying a man convicted of such terrible crimes 
deserves no other sentence

longtime comrade and cofounder of the guerrilla movement did not 
attend because of his feud with assad

opportunity for reconciliation with syria which expelled arafat 
in june 1983 amid a mutiny within the plo inspired by damascus 
he said there was a unanimous belief among the palestinians 
that this opportunity would lead to the restoration of warm 
relations between syria and the plo and bolster the 4monthold 
palestinian uprising in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza 
strip 
wazir was popular with both arafat loyalists and prosyrian 
dissidents palestinian factions divided since the plosyrian 
rift all denounced his killing and vowed revenge 
wazir known as abu jihad was the apparent mastermind of the 
palestinian uprising in the israelioccupied territories

church officials turned away a woman and her 
troubled 9yearold son from services at an episcopal church 
enforcing a court order barring them because of the boys 
disruptive behavior 
this is gods church not your church sheryl geartz quietly 
told the halfdozen men who blocked the door sunday at grace 
episcopal cathedral 
ms geartz prayed aloud before leaving dear lord we know 
this is your house we ask you to open your doors to let us in in 
jesus name we pray 
she then took her son and 7yearold daughter to another church 
the cathedral had obtained a restraining order in shawnee county 
district court last week that barred her and her son jason on the 
grounds that the boy disrupts services and his mother will not 
control him 
the churchs petition for a restraining order described jasons 
disruptive and dangerous activities such as pulling the fire 
alarm making loud noises throwing objects and destroying property 
ms geartz admits that jason has misbehaved but she says he has 
emotional problems and that taking him to church every week has 
improved his conduct 
the dean of grace cathedral the very rev robert r shahan 
said at a news conference later sunday that the church worked with 
ms geartz for seven months to try to restrain jason 
the level of disturbance moved from being merely annoying to 
being utterly intolerable said shahan 
some church members stopped attending services or stopped taking 
communion because of the disruptions shahan said 
we were faced with a situation in which one person had 
determined her needs were paramount to the needs of the entire 
congregation he said our duty as we see it must be to the 
congregation as a whole 
church officials were unable to find a solution ms geartz would 
accept to control the boy shahan said the dean the head 
clergyman of the cathedral said he expected criticism from people 
who would ask is getting a restraining order what a loving 
caring christian community does 
the answer is this is what a loving caring christian 
community does after seven months of trying to help to no 
avail he said 
ms geartz said she was aware that she was under court order not 
to appear at grace cathedral but she said she went to take a stand 
for people who are emotionally disturbed 
where will it stop she said if they ban my son from this 
church are they going to ban other children and even adults who 
have emotional problems 
ms geartz said she would pray before deciding whether to 
attempt to attend services next week

an african gray parrot alerted her owner 
by calling out his name when a tefloncoated pan caught fire but 
died from the fumes after the fire was extinguished 
a veterinarian said burning teflon has been found to cause 
respiratory arrest in birds 
chris barnes a university of colorado student said 7yearold 
coco died exactly one year after his mother barbara barnes givens 
of aurora gave him the bird as a birthday present 
barnes 21 who shares a house with five other students in 
boulder said one roommate arrived home early saturday and put a 
pot of water on the stove to make spaghetti 
barnes said the roommate went to his room and made a telephone 
call then fell asleep while the water boiled away 
barnes said about 430 am he heard coco screeching in the 
living room next to the kitchen and then calling his name 
he got up and found the kitchen was filled with smoke and the 
teflon lining of the redhot pot was aflame 
barnes said he put out the fire and aired out the room then 
checked on coco and found that the bird appeared to be all right 
but several minutes later he said he found the bird on the floor 
of her cage 
coco was valued at 1000 could whistle the theme from the 
movie the good the bad and the ugly and had a life expectancy 
of more than 100 years 
this is really tragic barnes said i was going to put her 
into my will to provide for future care 
veterinarian william dernell said cocos death is typical of 
other bird deaths involving teflon cookware 
he said an illinois veterinarian has found that burning teflon 
on cookware can release noxious fumes that cause respiratory arrest 
in birds 
it doesnt take much dernell said in some cases no 
burning has to take place if the teflon gets hot enough noxious 
fumes can be released and respiratory arrest in birds can occur

the united states is asking the government of 
south korea to give more money for the support of 43000 american 
troops stationed there an administration source said today 
a team of pentagon and state department officials will 
officially raise the request in june at the next round of regularly 
scheduled talks with south korea in seoul said the official he 
asked not to be identified 
we will be talking about increased direct support he said 
one reason we feel they should increase their contribution is 
their economic performance the other is our own budget problems 
he said 
south korea has enjoyed an economic boom in recent years with a 
record 978 billion account surplus last year south koreas trade 
surplus with the united states grew 39 percent in 1987 
south korea now contributes more than 100 million annually for 
the upkeep of the us force said the official 
in 1985 south korea paid 34 million in direct funds for the 
upkeep of the us forces said the official it also contributed 
about 1 billion indirectly through tax and rent exemptions for the 
public lands used by the us military he said 
the united states is asking the seoul government for an increase 
of 120 million but the south koreans would be willing to give 
only 60 million more 
at most the washington post reported today the official 
refused to discuss those figures 
many south koreans have been angered by reports of the us 
request saying that although the trade figures favor their 
country its residents are relatively poor by western standards 
south koreas per capita income is 3000 annually compared with 
about 17500 in the united states 
us officials are also concerned that as south korea builds up 
its military strength it will no longer want us help to protect 
the country against communist north korea 
we must keep our troops there to counter the northern 
threat said the american official theres no doubt about 
that 
without us troops the south korean military is weaker than 
its northern neighbor which enjoys the support of the soviet union 
and china

the supreme court said today it will consider 
overturning a key civil rights precedent allowing people to sue 
private citizens accused of racial discrimination four dissenting 
justices accused the court of undermining the trust minority groups 
have in it 
the court in an extraordinary move said it will use a north 
carolina case involving charges of onthejob racial harassment to 
consider throwing out a 12yearold decision 
in a strongly worded dissent justice john paul stevens said 
minority groups may feel betrayed by the courts order calling for 
reexamination of the 1976 case 
in addition to the impact of todays decision on the faith of 
victims of racial discrimination in a stable construction of the 
civil rights laws the order must also have a detrimental and 
enduring impact on the publics perception of the court as an 
impartial adjudicator stevens said 
he also accused the five justices in the majority of indulging 
in unwise activism by agreeing to review an issue that was not 
raised by either side in the north carolina case 
if the court decides to cast itself adrift from the 
constraints imposed by the adversary process and to fashion its own 
agenda the consequences for the nation and for the future of 
this court as an institution will be even more serious than any 
temporary encouragement of previously rejected forms of racial 
discrimination stevens continued 
the court has inflicted a serious and unwise wound upon 
itself today he said 
he was joined by justices william j brennan harry a blackmun 
and thurgood marshall 
the majority said the dissenters were making it sound like the 
court was overturning the 1976 decision 
we have of course done no such thing the majority said 
it is surely no affront to settled jurisprudence to request 
argument on whether a particular precedent should be modified or 
overruled 
the court took the unusual step of calling for reargument of the 
racial harassment case in a threepage unsigned order 
the case argued on feb 29 now will be held over until the 
courts 198889 term beginning in october 
voting to rehear the case and expand its scope were chief 
justice william h rehnquist and justice byron r white sandra day 
oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
the case stems from an appeal by brenda patterson a black 
woman who wants to use a postcivil war law to force her employer 
mcclean credit union to pay actual and punitive damages for 
alleged harassment 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals in 1986 upheld a ruling by 
a federal judge in winstonsalem nc throwing out her suit 
the appeals court said ms patterson could not use the civil 
warera law to charge racial harrasment the appeals court said the 
law is designed only to ban racial discrimination in hiring firing 
and promotion 
ms patterson still could charge racial harassment under a 1964 
civil rights law but the more recent statute provides that those 
who win their cases in court only may collect back pay not 
potentially heavy damages awarded as compensation for emotional and 
mental suffering 
civil rights groups say the more limited 1964 law may not be a 
sufficient deterrent to harassment 
ms patterson who worked as a teller and file coordinator at 
mclean credit union for 10 years until she was laid off in 1982 
charged her boss repeatedly harassed her because she is black 
todays high court action greatly expands the potential 
significance of the case 
the court said it will use the case to reconsider a 1976 ruling 
called runyon vs mccrary that said racially segregated private 
schools which refuse to admit black students violate the civil 
rights act of 1866 the law was enacted in the aftermath of the 
civil war to ensure that recently freed slaves would enjoy all the 
rights of citizenship 
the 1976 ruling has given civil rights groups an important legal 
weapon to fight discrimination by allowing the law to be used as a 
basis for suits against private individuals 
in a separate dissenting opinion today blackmun said i am at 
a loss to understand the motiviation of five members of this court 
to reconsider an interpretation of a civil rights statute that so 
clearly relfects our societys earnest commitment to ending racial 
discrimination and in which congress so evidently has acquiesced 
in other action the court 
let stand a ban on sexually explicit telephone dialup message 
services in arizona 
the justices without comment refused to hear arguments that 
the ban violates freespeech rights it was the first dialaporn 
case with which the court was confronted 
agreed to consider giving federal prison wardens more power to 
decide what publications inmates may read 
the court said it will review a ruling that limits the authority 
of officials to censor reading material behind prison bars 
turned away an appeal by former vice president spiro t agnew 
in a lawsuit alleging he was cheated out of more than 2 million 
for arranging a deal between a defense contractor and the argentine 
government 
the justices without comment refused to order the setting 
aside of more than 340000 in a special fund agnew and another 
businessman would receive if they win the lawsuit 
let stand a ruling that property owners rights are not 
violated when they are required to remove structures that could 
interfere with lowflying planes 
the court citing the lack of a substantial federal 
question rejected an appeal by a cheyenne wyo man fined 200 
a day for refusing to trim a 48foot cottonwood tree on his 
property

sirens sounded to signal the evacuation at about 925 am and 
brought little immediate response about one hour later only some 
30 people had arrived at an emergency shelter set up in nearby

volunteers participating in the drill which was designed to 
simulate a leak in a railroad tanker at the plant said they 
believed the operation was going well but at least one resident 
said mayhem would result if a real emergency occurred 
institute is the site of a rhonepoulenc chemical plant that 
formerly was owned by union carbide corp the plant produces methyl 
isocyanate the chemical that leaked from a union carbide plant in 
bhopal india in 1984 killing more than 2000 people 
less than a year later a leak of another chemical at the 
institute plant sent 135 people to the hospital prompting the call 
by some community leaders for an organized evacuation plan in case 
of a major leak 
barbara oden assistant vice president of academic affairs at 
west virginia state college next to the plant was in institute 
during the 1985 leak and said todays drill was useful even if 
people didnt participate 
we really didnt know what to do then at least now we have 
some idea she said people normally dont take things 
seriously they dont think it can really happen 
local officials responded to the problem of evacuating the town 
of 1500 by building a onelane emergency road out of town to help 
residents flee but the gate to that road is kept locked except 
when needed today was the first time it was used 
i can envision cars all over the track its just a little 
trail it would be mayhem it will be a mess said barbara clark 
a health and physical education instructor at the state college 
todays evacuation was conducted under special circumstances 
west virginia state called off classes this morning so there were 
no students to evacuate from academic buildings the town also was 
evacuated in stages so the roads leading out of town wouldnt be 
too crowded 
when this was prepared people didnt take it seriously 
said lois thurston a custodian at west virginia state college 
im sure if the students were here they wouldnt know what was 
going on

the judge in the irancontra case barred 
defendants today from presenting witnesses at a pretrial hearing 
on whether the prosecution relied on testimony given congress under 
a grant of immunity 
us district judge gerhard a gesell took the action and gave 
oliver l north and two of his codefendants a tonguelashing 
because they disobeyed his order establishing procedures for the 
hearing 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh was allowed to testify 
and he told the court of an elaborate procedure he established so 
that his entire staff would avoid exposure to the immunized 
testimony especially from news reports 
walsh is unable to use immunized congressional testimony by the 
defendants to prosecute them unless perjury is committed 
testifying with immunity during the irancontra hearings were 
north a former national security council staff memberhis onetime 
boss former national security adviser john m poindexter and 
businessman albert hakim the fourth defendant retired air force 
maj gen richard v secord testified without immunity 
gesell said the three immunized defendants ignored his order 
that they present a single grand jury witness who might testify 
that his grand jury testimony was influenced by the immunized 
congressional testimony 
instead lawyers for the three immunized defendants sought to 
present three witnesses and issued subpoenas for walsh and eight 
members of his staff to testify at the hearing gesell who had 
ordered that only walsh need testify canceled the subpoenas last 
week 
since the defendants did not comply they wont be allowed to 
present witnesses he said today when the hearing began 
its not unusual that defendants make decisions that they are 
not going to cooperate with the court thats their right we will 
proceed whether we have confrontation and namecalling or not 
during the hearing special independent counsel herbert j 
stern who is handling the immunity question introduced into 
evidence memos written or ordered by walsh which instructed his 
staff to avoid exposure to the immunized testimony and to other 
information on the defendants 
the memos also included instructions to grand jury witnesses and 
grand jurors to avoid such exposure especially through news 
articles or broadcasts 
the defendants in the case are charged with conspiring to use a 
lawful presidential order permitting the sale of arms to iran as a 
springboard to illegal actions including supplying assistance to 
the nicaraguan contras when such aid was banned

more than 75 cars and several trucks have been 
seized as part of zero tolerance a crackdown by us customs 
agents on people bringing even the tiniest amount of drugs into the 
united states from canada 
those caught with drugs also face federal charges and stiff 
customs fines 
we believe we are beginning to get peoples attention said 
us customs service agent lawrence ladage 
he said a lot of people are wondering if that marijuana 
joint was really worth this kind of aggravation and loss 
most of the vehicles will be auctioned off after administrative 
hearings a few will be returned to their owners he said 
ken parker assistant us attorney in seattle said he expects 
to file charges later this week in a substantial number of cases 
until recently people caught at the border with what is called 
user amounts of drugs usually paid an administrative fine to 
the customs service and were released 
but under the new program which started march 21 anyone caught 
at a border crossing with drugs faces possible arrest on federal 
charges regardless of the quantity any vehicle found to contain 
drugs is seized as is a vehicle carrying a driver or passenger 
with drugs 
onthespot fines range from several hundred dollars to more 
than 1000 and those caught also must agree to appear in federal 
court 
americans passports are seized and foreigners found guilty in 
federal court arent allowed back into the united states 
in one case ladage said a woman returning from a trip to 
canada with her boyfriend was shocked when her boyfriend was found 
to be carrying a small amount of drugs and authorities impounded 
her car 
she and her boyfriend arrived together at the border he 
said but i was told they left separately 
and on foot

a jury was chosen today for the retrial of a 
man charged in the killings of six members of a farm family in 
1973 and a defense attorney then asked that his client be fitted 
for dentures to improve his image 
it took three weeks to pick 12 jurors and four alternates for 
the retrial of wayne carl coleman after selection was complete 
judge hugh lawson heard arguments on defense motions 
coleman carl isaacs and george dungee were originally convicted 
and sentenced to death in 1974 for the slayings of six members of 
the ned alday family on their farm in southwest georgias seminole 
county 
the convictions were overturned in 1985 by the 11th us circuit 
court of appeals which said fair trials were impossible because of 
extensive publicity about the case 
the appeals court ordered new trials held elsewhere in georgia 
coleman is the second of the three to be retried his case is being 
heard in dekalb county superior court near atlanta 
isaacs was convicted in houston county earlier this year and was 
again sentenced to death 
after jury selection was completed lawson heard arguments on a 
defense request for a continuance to allow coleman to be fitted for 
dentures 
we think he will present a less favorable image to this jury 
without the dentures said colemans attorney thomas m west 
the judge said he would defer ruling on that motion and one for 
a change of venue until the close of business today the change of 
venue motion asks that the trial be moved to another location 
citing extensive publicity in atlanta 
another motion seeking billy isaacs carl isaacs younger 
brother as a defense witness was denied lawson said that since 
the younger isaacs is to be a witness for the prosecution defense 
attorneys will have chance to crossexamine him 
billy isaacs who was 15 when he witnessed the slayings turned 
states evidence and testified at the original trials he is 
serving a 40year prison sentence 
coleman carl isaacs and george dungee were escapees from a 
maryland prison when they were arrested 
alday his brother and three sons were shot one by one on may 
14 1973 when they arrived at the home of one of the sons where 
coleman and his companions were interrupted in a burglary 
according to testimony 
the wife of one of aldays sons was taken to a woods six miles 
away where she was raped and killed

governmentbacked family planning has cut 
chinese births by about 200 million in recent years but baby 
boomers are leading another population surge according to an 
official report quoted monday 
chinas family planning policy which limits the number of 
children per couple and promotes late childbearing has cut the 
births since the 1970s the domestic china news service said in a 
report appearing in hong kong newspapers 
china the worlds most populous nation has more than 1 billion 
people officials have estimated it must keep the birth rate below 
15 percent to reach its planned population limit of 12 billion at 
the turn of the century 
but the birth rate was 2 percent in each of the last two years 
a primary reason for the increase expected to last until at least 
1995 is that people born in the baby boom years of 196275 are 
reaching maturity and having their own babies the reports said

acid rain could be almost as big a contributor 
as fertilizer runoff or sewage and industrial water pollution to 
the decline of marine life in east coast estuaries an 
environmental group concluded today 
a study by the environmental defense fund said nitrate compounds 
from the atmosphere originating mostly as nitric acid 
contribute 25 percent of the total nitrogen input to cheasapeake 
bay compared with 34 percent from fertilizers and 23 percent from 
municipal sewage and industrial discharges 
nitrates act as fertilizers encouraging blooms of algae 
that use up oxygen dissolved in the water and making it difficult 
for other plants and fish to live 
these airborne compounds also are contributing to problems in 
delaware bay albemarlepamlico sound in north carolina long 
island sound between new york and connecticut and the new york 
bight in the atlantic ocean off new york and new jersey the 
groups scientists said 
the problem of enhanced primary productivity from atmospheric 
nitrogen inputs appears to be widespread along the atlantic 
seaboard the funds report said 
release of the report kicked off three days of rallies press 
conferences and other events by environmental groups timed to 
coincide with this weeks visit to washington by canadian prime 
minister brian mulroney 
canada supported by us environmentalists for years has been 
unsuccessfully pressing the united states to act against the 
pollution precursors that form acid rain and flow northward across 
the border before falling on canada 
the mostoftenmentioned precursor is sulfur dioxide which 
turns into sulfuric acid in the atmosphere sulfur dioxide is 
mostly emitted by coalburning power plants but an estimated 
onethird of the rainfall acidity in the eastern united states 
actually comes from oxides of nitrogen which become nitric acid in 
the atmosphere 
nationwide about onethird of nitrigen oxides originate in 
power plant emissions onethird in motor vehicle exhaust and 
oneseventh in industrial emnissions 
todays report was the first to estimate the input to chesapeake 
bay of nitrates originating in the atmosphere not only as direct 
rain and other deposition on the bay itself an estimated 9150 
tons per year but also in runoff from the land of the bays 
watershed 29400 tons per year the fund estimated that 154000 
tons of nitrogen compounds from all sources wind up in the bay 
the total of 154000 tons was in the range of estimates given by 
the joint federalstate chesapeake bay pollution control program 
92000 tons to 198000 tons 
the fund called on the joint program to adopt measures aimed at 
reducing atmospheric deposition of nitrogen compounds to the bay 
and its watershed by 40 percent the program already has adopted a 
goal of reducing nitrogen and phosphorous discharges to the bay by 
40 percent 
at the environmental protection agency spokesman chris rice 
said no agency expert had had a chance to study the funds report 
and the epa therefore was not in a position to comment

british airways will ban smoking on one of its 
busiest domestic routes for a month beginning tuesday in the first 
of a series of smokefree flights 
the airline will forbid an estimated 2500 passengers from 
lighting up on its 12 daily onehour shuttle flights between 
londons heathrow airport and glasgow scotland 
on june 6 some british airways flights to the continent will 
become smokefree for a month and in november some los angeles and 
new yorkbound flights join the experiment 
several small british carriers have banned smoking on domestic 
and international flights but british airways is the largest to 
try it the companys only domestic competitor british midland 
airways said it had no plans to ban smoking 
unlike the united states where the government forced airlines 
to ban smoking on all domestic flights shorter than two hours 
britain has no national laws concerning smoking about 34 percent 
of british adults smoke cigarettes 
british airways officials said they took action because research 
showed that if smoking were banned the number of customers who 
would fly more often was four times the number who would switch 
airlines 
in recent years demand for nonsmoking areas on our aircraft 
have grown and grown today on most routes smokers are very much in 
the minority said jim harris marketing director for the 
airline we have steadily increased nonsmoking areas to reflect 
this trend now we want a full trial of customer reaction to 
see if we can extend the idea still further 
airline spokesman michael blunt said the carrier will decide 
whether to continue the bans after studying surveys and other 
passenger response 
stephen eyres director of a prosmoking group criticized the 
idea as discriminatory dangerous and unnecessary 
our view is that so long as nonsmokers wishes are respected 
with definite nosmoking areas there also ought to be areas where 
smokers can light up and not be treated like social lepers he 
said 
he said the bans would lead to safety risks from people smoking 
in toilets and said that it was unnecessary because cabin air is 
changed every three minutes 
opposition lawmaker george foulkes said monday he would 
introduce a bill in parliament tuesday to ban smoking in the 
workplace saying some people regard it as torture to have to 
work in a smokefilled workplace 
but opposition legislation rarely passes the legislative body 
and a government spokesman said that government planned no national 
laws banning smoking on airlines or in public places 
its like drinking its a question of choice its a part of 
societys freedoms said paul hayward of the department of health 
and social services at this moment this government has no 
intention to inhibit this generally accepted freedom

an explosion and fire struck the submarine 
uss bonefish off florida forcing the crew to abandon ship the 
navy said three of the 92member crew were missing today and 23 
were injured 
crews from two frigates and a helicopter searched the atlantic 
for the missing men after sunday afternoons fire looking and 
listening for any kind of sound or indication of the men said 
lt cmdr bill sonntag of the norfolkbased atlantic fleet 
were doing everything we can to find them out there he 
said 
the submarine was afloat alongside the frigate uss mccloy 
officials said 
no one has been back on board to assess the damage chief 
petty officer terry borton said today from atlantic fleet 
headquarters here at this time there is no smoke coming from 
the vessel 
the bonefish one of the navys last dieselelectric submarines 
surfaced sunday afternoon 160 miles east of cape canaveral fla 
said cmdr fred leeder a fleet spokesman 
the fire was believed caused by an explosion in the 30yearold 
submarines battery compartment sonntag said because of fire and 
toxic fumes the commanding officer ordered the vessel evacuated 
he said 
of the missing we dont know whether they are still aboard 
the submarine or whether they were in the water said capt brent 
baker another fleet spokesman 
the injured were transfered to the aircraft carrier john f 
kennedy and taken to the naval hospital in jacksonville fla 
according borton 
the extent of the injuries were unknown but some of them had 
smoke inhalation baker said 
a spokesman for the hospital nick young said that of the 23 
injured 20 were ambulatory but he had no further information 
the remainder of the bonefishs crewmen were taken aboard the 
frigate uss carr and taken to mayport fla for a flight back to 
the bonefishs home port of charleston sc 
the solemnfaced crewmen refused requests from reporters to 
answer questions about the fire when they arrived in mayport most 
were wearing blue coveralls and sneakers but many were shoeless a 
few carried small plastic bags apparently holding a few of their 
belongings 
they were taken to a waiting cargo plane 
chaplain bill perry went aboard the carr and visited the men 
he said the general mood was overwhelming fatigue adding 
that most had been up all night and many had been on watch the 
night before 
theyve been through a real trauma he said 
leeder said the carr would attempt to tow the submarine either 
to port canaveral fla or charleston there apparently was no 
serious problem in keeping it afloat late sunday leeder said 
the submarine rescue ship uss petrel from charleston is on its 
way and will determine whether the fire is out the navy said the 
petrel is expected to arrive early this afternoon 
people from the petrel will be boarding the sub to make any 
kind of damage assessment said lt cmdr patricia mcmillan also 
a norfolk spokesman adding that afterward a decision would be 
made on where to tow the sub 
leeder said it would take considerable time to tow the bonefish 
into port it can make about 3 mph under tow a senior naval 
officer said 
the bonefish had been taking part in routine exercises for about 
a week with the carr and the jfk in what is called the jacksonville 
operations area authorities said 
the sub was commissioned in 1959 and is used primarily for 
training leeder said 
the 2895ton 219foot submarine was built by new york 
shipbuilding in camden nj and launched in 1958 it normally 
carries a crew of 82 it is capable of traveling about 15 knots on 
the surface and about 21 knots submerged according to janes 
fighting ships 
it is powered by three 1500horsepower diesel engines that 
drive a single propeller while traveling on the surface once 
submerged it is driven by two electric motors 
the bonefish like its sister vessels the barbel and blueback 
is capable of carrying torpedoes but no missiles 
they were the last dieselelectric combat submarines to be 
constructed for the navy and were expected to be decomissioned in 
the 80s 
navy officials use the dieselpowered subs to simulate soviet 
submarines because the soviet union still operates approximately 
100 dieselelectric vessels in all the united states operates 
four dieselelectric boats

education secretary william j bennetts 
report that american education is doing better but not well enough 
met today with a failing grade from one teachers union for 
absolving the federal government from any responsibility for 
improving public education 
teachers deserve the credit for the academic progress in the 
five years since a similar study became a biting critique of us 
education called a nation at risk said mary hatwood futrell 
president of the national education association 
another teachers union called the bennett report a mixed 
bag 
his report a followup requested by president reagan for the 
fifth anniversary of a nation at risk said that american 
schools have begun the long climb back but that the nation is 
still at risk from an academic system rife with mediocrity and 
resistant to change 
bennett says american teenagers are taking more math science 
and advanced placement courses and scoring somewhat higher on 
collegeentrance and other tests 
but curricular foolishness has not been eliminated from 
american high schools he said and the schools are still much 
too cavalier about homework 
in his evaluation of the impact of school reform called 
american education making it work bennett said 
american education has made some undeniable progress in the 
last few years the precipitous downward slide of previous decades 
has been arrested and we have begun the long climb back to 
reasonable standards 
we are doing better than we were in 1983 but we are certainly 
not doing well enough we are still at risk 
bennett will deliver his report to reagan in a white house 
ceremony tuesday the fifth anniversary of the provocative report 
by the national commission on excellence in education that warned 
of a rising tide of mediocrity in us schools 
the national education association which is frequently at odds 
with bennett planned to mark the anniversary tuesday with a 
protest in lafayette park across from the white house 
i give the report a failing grade said ms futrell the nea 
president it absolves the federal government from any 
responsibility for improving public education on the plus side 
teachers deserve the credit for the academic progress the students 
have made since 1983 
had it not been for the efforts of congress which held back 
the tide of budget cuts proposed by the reagan administration 
she said schools would have been in much worse shape which 
gives congress an a 
its a mixed bag said jane usdan spokeswoman for the 
american federation of teachers he highlights what happened over 
the last five years that theres been a lot of good including 
increases in teachers salaries and standards that have been 
tightened 
but she said theres a lot that needs still to be done and 
the question is whether these kinds of reforms are going to do 
the job thats needed 
bennett said too many students drop out and too many of those 
who do graduate have been poorly educated our students know too 
little and their command of essential skills is too slight 
good schools for disadvantaged and minority children are much 
too rare an ethos of success is missing from too many american 
schools he said our teachers and principals are too often 
hired and promoted in ways that make excellence a matter of chance 
not design 
bennett called anew for merit pay for teachers wider choice in 
public education for parents stronger curricula at all levels and 
stricter accountability for educators including freedom for local 
schools to hire the best and fire the worst teachers and principals 
he said a forthcoming national assessment of educational 
progress report indicates 9 and 17yearolds improved their 
performance in math between 1982 and 1986 while 13yearolds held 
steady 
another national assessment will show that in those same years 
17yearold science students made up nearly all the ground lost 
since the 1977 assessment he said 
a new federal study indicated that 127 percent of last years 
high school seniors completed all the courses recommended in a 
nation at risk four years of english three years each of math 
science and social studies a halfyear of computer science and 
for the collegebound two years of foreign language 
by comparison fewer than 2 percent of graduates in the class of 
1982 took such a regimen researchers reviewed the transcripts of 
15000 graduates from each year 
the same study indicated fewer students are drifting into less 
rigorous general tracks in high school only 17 percent were on 
a general track in 1987 down from 35 percent in 1982 
but american students still are humbled by international 
comparisons including a recent science assessment that found 
american 10yearolds were average but our 14yearolds are far 
behind their peers around the world placing 14th out of 17 
countries bennett said 
he took a slap at what he called the chicken littles who believe 
that some children cant learn because their color class or 
family background gets in th way 
bennett said minorities already comprise 28 percent of americas 
schoolage population apocalyptic analyses and chicken little 
stories about an onrushing wave of unteachable students should be 
rejected he said 
above all sound education reforms are threatened by the 
determined opposition they elicit bennett said pointing to 
what might be called opposition by extortion the false claim 
that to fix our schools will first require a fortune in new 
funding 
bennetts predecessor th bell who commissioned a nation at 
risk has accused the president of failing to provide strong 
leadership for school reform 
bell and such groups as the carnegie foundation for the 
advancement of teaching and the committee for economic development 
have warned in recent months that school reform is not working in 
americas largely minority innercity school systems 
bennett however said achievement can be torpedoed by the 
idea that it is mostly a matter of luck wealth or native ability 
an idea altogether too prevalent in american education today 
bennett said average teacher salaries after inflation have 
risen from 23451 in 198283 to an estimated 28300 today nearly 
a 21 percent rise and more college students are expressing 
interest in the profession but until good teachers are paid more 
than bad ones our efforts to improve teaching and learning will be 
frustrated 
he complained that there are more penalties for serving up a 
single rotten hamburger in a restaurant than for repeatedly 
furnishing a thousand children with a rotten education 
we urgently need to improve our methods for locating able and 
talented teachers and administrators for encouraging and promoting 
them and for penalizing those who consistently fail to do their 
job he said 
accountability is the linchpin of education reform

sales of existing homes spurred by lower 
mortgage rates edged up 25 percent in march for the second month 
in a row a real estate trade group said monday 
the national association of realtors said existing singlefamily 
homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted rate of 333 million units 
last month 
despite the march rise which followed an identical 25 percent 
increase in february the rate of sales remained 98 percent below 
march 1987 the sales pace had dipped in november december and 
january 
housing activity has recovered from the low levels of the 
winter but even so we can expect to see fewer sales in 1988 
than in 1987 said mark obrinsky an economist with the us 
league of savings institutions 
john a tuccillo the realtors chief economist attributed the 
sales increase to lower interest rates 
we expect the recovery to continue with aprils sales 
figures likely to be up also he said 
a year ago 30year fixedrate mortgages bottomed out at just 
above 9 percent they rose in spurts topping 115 percent in early 
october rates eased after the stock market crash dipping just 
below 10 percent in february and march before rising again to 103 
percent last week 
obrinsky said interest rates were likely to rise slowly and 
steadily this year but he said that would disrupt sales less than 
the sharp jumps taken by interest rates in 1987 
i think on balance we could see sales still hold up for some 
months down the road before the impact of the higher mortgage rates 
begins to take its toll he said 
the march sales increase was accompanied by a 41 percent rise 
in prices to a national median or midpoint of 88700 up from 
88100 in february tuccillo predicted only modest increases for 
the rest of the year 
by region the median resale price was 143100 in the 
northeast compared with 128900 a year ago 117100 in the west 
compared with 105900 84000 in the south compared with 
81200 and 67800 in the midwest down from 68300 
sales were led by a 96 percent advance in the west to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 570000 units and a 67 percent 
boost to 127 million units in the south sales were unchanged in 
the northeast at 660000 units and down 34 percent in the midwest 
to 860000 units

democrat michael dukakis said today he would 
talk with terrorists holding hostages but never make 
concessions commenting one day after campaign rival jesse 
jackson criticized what he said was dukakis view that we should 
not negotiate with terrorists 
jackson set off the exchange sunday when he said ive raised 
the point in several debates this year every time a question comes 
up about terrorism mr dukakis says im against terrorism 
we should not negotiate with terrorists in the middle east 
never negotiate with terrorists 
i disagree with that if i could get the hostages out id do 
it 
dukakis in pennsylvania told reporters today after being asked 
about jacksons statement i think we need a tough antiterrorist 
policy 
i dont have a problem with talking but you never make 
concessions to terrorists ever if you do what you end up with 
is hostagetaking and terrorism all over the world 
jackson asked today about negotiating with terrorists said he 
would not make material concessions to them but could conceive 
of situations in which he would grant hostagetakers safe passage 
i would never exchange arms for hostages he said a 
reference to the irancontra operations steered by reagan 
administration officials 
us policy holds that american officials will talk to any 
official or group about the safety and release of hostages but we 
will not make concessions a state department spokesman said 
today 
the gentle battling between the surviving democratic candidates 
got more direct as the candidates closed in on tuesdays 
delegaterich pennsylvania primary 
a new poll sponsored by philadelphias kywtv and pittsburghs 
kdkatv showed dukakis apparently increasing his lead among likely 
pennsylvania democratic voters in the new poll taken by telephone 
over the weekend dukakis led jackson 57 percent to 31 percent with 
12 percent still undecided 
last week with sen albert gore jr still being counted 
dukakis led jackson 45 percent to 34 percent with 14 percent 
undecided and 7 percent for gore the polls with a margin of error 
of five percentage points either way were conducted by krc 
research of cambridge mass 
it was jackson who has stirred the biggest controversy in recent 
days with his call on sunday for negotiation with anyone to free 
hostages 
in this world in this ambiguous world you must not set up 
preconditions that stop effectiveness jackson said at a rally in 
washington i would meet with anyone i could meet with to get the 
hostages out of beirut 
eight americans are currently held hostage by moslem extremists 
in beirut 
on sunday dukakis did a whistlestop tour of pennsylvania but 
he was switching to the air today hitting six cities to make an 
impression in every media market in the state before the voters go 
to the polls tuesday 
jackson raised money in washington before returning late sunday 
for a final push in the keystone state 
dukakis has a big lead in the polls in pennsylvania where 178 
delegates are at stake the complicated process with delegates 
elected individually offers a challenge to voters who may have to 
pull the lever up to 12 times but it also offers dukakis if he 
does well a chance to win as many as 100 more delegates than 
jackson 
youve got to vote more than once this is the one time you 
can do so legally he told students at penn state university in 
state college vote early and often vote for me and vote for my 
delegates 
dukakis is more than half the way to a delegate majority 
holding 107515 national convention votes jackson has 8361 while 
59975 were uncommitted a tally of 2081 or more is needed to win 
the nomination at the july convention in atlanta 
guams three convention votes entered the uncommitted column 
sunday evening following caucuses on the pacific island 
on the republican side vice president george bush is virtually 
unchallenged on tuesday in pennsylvania when he may win enough of 
the 78 delegates at stake to go over the magic majority mark 
1139 needed to win the gop nomination in new orleans in august 
a new poll by time magazine indicates that a dukakisjackson 
ticket would get 47 percent of the vote nationwide to 42 percent 
for a republican ticket headed by bush 
a dukakisgore ticket would defeat bush 49 percent to 39 
percent but bush would defeat jackson by 52 percent to 34 percent 
according to the poll released sunday 
on the democratic side dukakis and jackson have been unusually 
cordial recently but the bestfriends atmosphere thinned when 
jackson urged dukakis to release a proposed budget 
im not just for head start im willing to pay for head 
start jackson said during the debate saturday night in 
pittsburgh i have put numbers together to pay for my dreams 
dukakis strongly disagreed 
you cant prepare a budget now for next year thats 
absurd he told reporters sunday on his chartered amtrak train 
nicknamed the pennsylvania presidential unlimited 
ill lay out where im going to make the cuts ive done that 
in great detail dukakis said as he toured western pennsylvania

field commanders in the national war on drugs 
heard a pair of federal battle plans on monday plans that found 
different groups to blame for the growing problem and different 
solutions 
a democratic member of congress charged that the reagan 
administration lacked an organized plan to battle drugs and he 
called for a drug summit meeting with the heads of latin american 
nations 
a top aide to president reagan on the other hand said it was 
time to put more pressure on those who use drugs 
in remarks to a meeting of the national conference of mayors 
rep charles rangel dny said it was not enough that the drug 
enforcement administration and other justice department agencies 
were battling drugs they should be getting help from the state 
department the education department the defense department and 
the department of health and human services 
its not a question of whether were losing the battle its a 
question that we dont even know whos in charge of the war 
rangel told a session of mayors and police chiefs 
but gary l bauer reagans assistant for policy development 
told the meeting that the nation does not appear to have reached 
the collective state of mind neded to defeat the drug problem 
drugs pour into america because there is a market for them he 
said and the battle needs to be waged against the users 
accomplices in crime are young couples who think its all right 
to use drugs casually on the weekend abstainers who look away when 
others use drugs sports heroes who set a bad example by using 
drugs college presidents who know drugs are on campus but fail to 
act civil libertarians who tie up the courts with technicalities 
and sophistry and television and movie producers who glorify drugs 
bauer said 
unless we find the political will to penalize the users as 
well as the dealers the drug problem will remain he said the 
nation cannot buy or blast its way drug free with financial 
programs and the military he said 
rangel pressed by new orleans mayor sidney barthelemy said he 
plans to introduce a measure to direct federal antidrug funds 
directly to large cities rather than through federal and state 
bureaucracies 
in addition rangel called for increased participation of all 
federal agencies in antidrug battles 
to begin with he said the state department should call a 
summit of nations from latin america to find ways to cooperate in 
the drug war a plan must be developed to work with people 
you cant take a farmer who is making 10000 on coca leaves 
and tell him to go back to his former crop that made 500 rangel 
said 
in addition to involving the state department rangel questioned 
the reluctance of the defense department to join in patroling the 
borders asked for education department antidrug programs and 
suggested drug rehabilitation organized by the health and human 
services department 
as to the suggestion that more and more drug users be arrested 
where do you put them he said

a top sandinista official was in miami today for 
talks with representatives of the contra rebels as the two sides 
prepared for a new round of peace negotiations in nicaragua later 
this week 
sandinista deputy foreign minister victor tinoco was meeting 
secretly with the contra directors secretary to discuss the 
agenda and arrangements for talks to begin thursday in managua 
rebel leader adolfo calero said 
calero also said the contras will demand the sandinistas 
immediately allow us food and supplies to rebel troops as a 
precondition for any further talks based on the agreement reached 
last month in sapoa nicaragua 
if that is not done the whole sapoa agreement will collapse 
calero said 
an internal contra memo written by luis fley who goes by the 
name cmdr johnson recently called the situation of the contras 
troops in the field critical 
calero said the sandinistas must immediately agree on what the 
rebels call the modus operandi for getting the humanitarian aid 
to the contra forces inside nicaragua 
the plight of the troops has reportedly been a contributing 
cause to a rift among the contra leaders but today calero 
downplayed the differences among the five directors 
he denied leading a movement to fire top contra cmdr enrique 
bermudez but acknowledged two other rebel field commanders walter 
calderon and diogenes hernadnez had objected to the peace talks 
he also said three top civilian employees of the rebel troops had 
been replaced by military officials 
but he inisted there was still unity among the directors of the 
nicaraguan resistance as the contras are formally called 
all five directors including aristides sanchez who skipped the 
last meeting in managua for personal reasons will fly to 
nicaragua for this weeks negotiations calero said 
calero refused to discuss where tinoco was conducting the 
premeeting talks with the directors secretary in strongly 
anticommunist miami but he said there were no plans for the 
sandinista foreign ministry official to talk with the directors 
themselves here 
tinoco previously has accused the contras of engaging in 
political maneuvering to avoid a definitive ceasefire while they 
receive us aid

added to the domestic news staff during 1988 
the bulk of these will go to our line bureaus whose state and 
regional news coverage is so important to you he told publishers 
and editors of newspapers that use the ap with the membership 
increasing as it has the demands on our state bureaus are 
increasing and we must meet those needs

140year history has the associated press faced greater challenges 
or more exciting prospects than in 1988 with newspaper membership

leadership in news technology will meet those challenges keating

delivery rate can be reduced but he said the news will fly on ap 
circuits at 9600 that increase in capacity will avoid crowding 
that can slow copy delivery just as a crowded highway can slow 
traffic

president najib on monday offered to 
withdraw afghan troops from their posts near the pakistani border 
if anticommunist guerrillas and pakistan agree to do the same 
we are ready to create a nonmilitary line between 
afghanistan and pakistan najib said at the opening of celebrations 
marking the 10th anniversary of the afghan revolution that 
installed a sovietbacked government 
najib told an assembly of three small parties loyal to his 
government that such a withdrawal would allow the estimated 3 
million afghan refugees in pakistan to return home 
however the proposal appeared to be little more than a 
facesaving acknowledgement of the difficulties the afghan army is 
having against onslaughts by anticommunist guerrillas based in 
pakistan and supplied with us and chinese weapons 
soviet troops entered afghanistan in 1979 to help quell an 
uprising by a guerrilla front 
the soviet union has agreed to start withdrawing its estimated 
115000 troops from afghanistan on may 15 under a unmediated 
agreement signed april 14 in geneva by the united states the 
soviet union afghanistan and pakistan 
the united states china and several other countries have been 
aiding the afghan guerrillas via pakistan the soviet union arms 
the afghan military forces each superpower has reserved the right 
to continue its assistance as long as the other one does 
the guerrillas who were not direct party to the geneva accord 
have vowed to continue fighting until najibs government is 
overthrown 
on sunday najib confirmed a guerrilla claim that the afghan 
army had been pushed out of barikot a key post on the pakistani 
frontier 
barikot 150 miles northeast of kabul controls a major road 
leading into afghanistan from pakistan the guerrillas said the 
victory opened a new direct supply route for weapons into 
afghanistan 
the guerrillas said monday they have taken control of three 
other strategic towns in recent weeks ghorband 50 miles north of 
kabul and maarouf and darwazgai both in the south about 30 miles 
from the pakistani bordar 
western sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
guerrillas captured ghorband in late march there was no immediate 
word on the other two claims 
the guerrillas also said najibs government is negotating with 
moslem guerillas for the release of a provincial governor captured 
by insurgents earlier this month 
the insurgents are holding the governor of northern kunduz 
province the chief of police and two senior afghan army officers 
the governor and the two other officials were not identified 
brig abdullah haq ulomi said the afghan army would withdraw 
from the border at the points that are needed several dozen if 
necessary 
ulomi heads the afghan army department of the central committee 
of the ruling peoples democratic party of afghanistan 
a foreign diplomat warned that us officials were incorrect to 
assume that guerrilla victories near the pakistani border were 
signs the sovietbacked government was in trouble 
we are very surprised by the optimism of american officials 
said the diplomat who asked not be identified 
they believe the government of najib will collapse after the 
withdrawal of the soviet troops but this optimism seems to me and 
to other western observers to be very worrying because it is 
absolutely not true he said 
najib in his speech at the polytechnic institute in kabul 
called the soviet withdrawal the significant event of the year 
he asserted that the soviet troops have enabled the afghan army 
to maintain a military balance with the guerrillas 
najib said his army must maintain this balance and much has to 
be done to prepare for the return of refugees 
about 5 million afghans onethird of the countrys population 
have fled since the soviet intervention about 3 milllion are in 
pakistan and most of the rest are in iran 
najib spoke in dari for one hour to the revolutionary 
organization of afghanistan the peasants organization of 
afghanistan and the toilers organization of afghanistan his 
remarks were translated by government employees 
the 10th anniversary of the revolution is wednesday but parades 
and speeches marking the event will take place tuesday

only a few weeks before a soviet 
pullout afghan guerrilla leaders are trying to maintain the 
illusion of unity while they squabble over ways of establishing an 
interim government in afghanistan 
since the signing of the geneva agreement on april 14 the 
guerrillas who were not party to the accord also have stepped 
up their war against the communists with about a dozen reported 
operations inside the country 
more than 180 enemy troops have been killed or wounded 
including 20 soviets the guerrillas say 
what is clear is that in the current month and especially 
since the signing of the geneva accord a significant number of 
enemy military and command posts have fallen to the mujahedeen 
said burhaneddin rabanni leader of the jamiat islami party one 
party in the sevenmember anticommunist front 
these are the last days of the war contended hamed karzai 
spokesman for the moderate national liberation front as in any 
war towards its end fighting intensifies both sides try to 
establish their hegemony 
rabanni said soon after the geneva accord was signed by the 
united states the soviet union pakistan and afghanistan the 
guerrillas gave orders to all field commanders to launch attacks on 
enemy strongholds 
the rebels have also begun setting up new military bases inside 
afghanistan he said 
last weeks guerrilla takeover of the afghan army garrison at 
barikot on the pakistan border should aid the guerrillas in this 
endeavor 
the guerrillas said fridays victory opened a new direct supply 
route for weapons into afghanistan president najib acknowledged 
the guerrilla victory on sunday 
on monday the guerrillas also claimed to have taken control of 
three other strategic towns in recent weeks ghorband 50 miles 
north of kabul and maarouf and darwazgai both in the south about 
30 miles from the pakistani bordar 
the soviet union has said it will begin withdrawing its 115000 
troops from afghanistan on may 15 its troops entered afghanistan 
in 1979 to quell an uprsing by anticommunist guerrillas 
on the political front the the leaders of the sevenparty 
guerrilla alliance disagree about the structure of a provisional 
government and how to go about setting it up 
ahmad shah a 44yearold engineer with the hardline ittihad 
islami party who has been named president of the provisional 
government said the 14member cabinet will meet once a week to 
outline new programs and plans 
but sebaghatullah mojadeddi leader of the moderate national 
front believes the provisional government is a joke 
how can we have a government when it has not been approved by 
the people he said up to 700000 afghans are armed and when 
the government is weak there are going to be clashes and 
bloodshed 
the parties are also divided over the form of elections to be 
held for approving an interim government 
some want elections among the estimated 3 million afghan 
refugees in pakistan others favor elections inside afghanistan as 
well as in pakistan 
the guerrillas do agree on one thing there is no chance for 
reconciliation with afghan president najib and his communist 
supporters 
they differ however on the question of how to deal with the 
communists should they be overthrown 
alliance chief gulbaddin hekmatyar the most hardline of the 
guerrilla leaders has called for a trial of najib and other 
communists 
mojaddedi however says if najib and others repent and 
embrace islam they ought to be pardoned 
this is not the time for revenge he said

the supreme court confronted with its first 
dialaporn case today let stand a ban on sexually explicit 
telephone dialup message services in arizona 
the justices without comment refused to hear arguments that 
the ban violates freespeech rights 
the courts action comes at a time when congress the federal 
communications commission and state governments have taken steps to 
crack down on dialaporn companies whose services are available to 
callers through 976 numbers and atampts 900 longdistance lines 
congress last week sent to the president a bill that would ban 
all dialaporn services 
american civil liberties union lawyers said the proposed law 
likely would be ruled unconstitutional they support providing 
means of having the services available only to those who want them 
the fcc last week levied 600000 in fines against two 
california dialaporn firms accused of failing to prevent children 
from hearing their messages 
among the states the california public utilities commission 
most recently ordered the states telephone companies to provide 
lowcost blocking for customers who want to cut off access from 
their phones to dialaporn and other pay services 
blocking is available to phone subscribers in 21 of the 34 
states where local 976 services are available according to a 
recent survey by state telephone regulation report a 
virginiabased industry newsletter 
only in utah can customers have 976 calls blocked at no cost 
antipornography groups do not like the blocking alternative to 
flat bans because they say it puts a financial burden on the phone 
subscriber and not the provider 
the 976 and 900 exchanges also are used for other 
noncontroversial types of messages such as sports scores time 
checks and stock market and weather reports 
bradley keirnes vice president of citizens for decency through 
law inc a public interest law firm based in phoenix ariz 
specializing in obscenity law said the supreme courts decision 
clearly puts the ball in the phone companies court 
he said the decision means atampt and the bell companies now can 
pull the plug on dialaporn providers without fear of violating 
the companies first amendment rights 
in arizona mountain bell in 1985 announced a new policy banning 
from its 976 message network all firms that provide adult 
entertainment messages with sexually oriented content 
the policy not imposed in other states where mountain bell 
provides phone service was challenged by two firms carlin 
communications inc and sapphire communications inc as impeding 
their freedom of speech 
only the government or some agent of the government can violate 
someones constitutional rights and so the two dialaporn 
companies argued that mountain bells policy represented state 
action 
they noted that mountain bell is a heavily regulated public 
utility and pointed to various pressures state authorities had put 
on mountain bell to rid its 976 network of such message services 
for example the maricopa county prosecutor cited a state 
criminal law shielding minors from harmful items in a letter which 
said should mountain bell continue to air these messages it is 
the intention of this office to prosecute not only the subscribers 
who provide the messages but mountain bell 
a federal trial judge ruled that mountain bell could not refuse 
to carry the dialaporn messages but the 9th us circuit court of 
appeals reversed that ruling last year 
noting that modern telephonic technology permits the pervasive 
transmission of vast quantities of information as well as 
shakespeare shaw and smut the appeals court said mountain 
bells policy did not amount to state action 
a similar decision by another federal appeals court previously 
enabled southern bell to keep dialaporn services out of florida 
georgia north carolina and south carolina 
justice sandra day oconnor did not participate in the courts 
denial of review to carlin communications vs mountain states

the rapist who savagely mutilated a 
teenage girl nine years ago is free from parole today but friends 
of larry singleton worry about his safety wherever he tries to 
settle 
when singleton was paroled from prison a year ago furious 
protests followed him from town to town as state officials tried to 
find a place for him to live 
protesters were outraged that the 60yearold former merchant 
marine served only eight years for his crime a sixyear reduction 
because of good behavior and work credits 
after gov george deukmejian intervened singleton wound up in a 
mobile home on the grounds of san quentin prison last week 
officials moved him to an undisclosed location 
as of midnight sunday singleton was free to go wherever he 
liked and was under no obligation to tell prison officials his 
whereabouts he has told thomas clyde smith jr leader of the 
bride of christ church in azalea ore he would like to live there 
after first visiting his sister in florida 
but his safety is uncertain say some of singletons supporters 
after news reports singleton might live at the oregon church 
farm several shots were fired at its buildings said bob plath an 
attorney and member of teachers network foundation a religious 
group that befriended singleton during his parole 
this is a country of laws plath said in a recent interview 
he served his time he has a right to be left alone and left in 
peace 
singletons victim mary vincent lives in seclusion in the 
pacific northwest and said in published interviews recently that 
her fear has been revived by singletons impending freedom 
ill never get over this said vincent 
singleton hacked off her forearms with an ax on sept 29 1978 
and left her for dead in stanislaus county 45 miles east of san 
francisco 
she recently had singleton served with a 24 million judgment 
won in a civil lawsuit against him last year in nevada she filed 
the nevada order in orange county superior court earlier this month 
after singleton wrote to county prosecutors asking that they 
investigate his claim that it was vincent who attacked him 
public outrage has continued almost unabated since singletons 
release 
heres a girl who lost her arms and will never get them back 
and heres the guy who did it he got 14 years and hes out in 
eight said stanislaus county district attorney donald stahl who 
prosecuted singleton 
there aint no justice its the thing i hear over and over 
and over from everyone 
singleton has insisted he was innocent adding that he believes 
she attacked him i never live in the past he said in a recent 
television interview 
he also passed a lie detector test set up by the teachers 
network foundation which quizzed him on the crime former fbi 
special agent francis connolly who administered the test said it 
only proves that singleton believes he is innocent the test was 
demonstrated on a recent public television program about singleton 
in 1979 a jury in san diego convicted singleton of kidnap 
rape mayhem and attempted murder in the attack on vincent then 
age 15 he was sentenced to 14 years and four months in prison 
vincent was discovered naked on a rural road she told police 
her attacker was a man named larry who picked her up in berkeley 
and told her he would take her to los angeles but instead took her 
to a deserted area near modesto 
singleton was arrested 10 days later in sparks nev detectives 
found the burned remains of vincents clothes in the fireplace of 
singletons house in san pablo

president reagan is still mulling whether to 
increase us military involvement in the persian gulf a white 
house spokesman said today amid indications of fresh 
administration concern about the american presence there 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said a number of options are still 
being weighed and that no decisions have been made on the 
possible broadening of the us escort role for neutral ships in 
the strategic waterway 
but fitzwater contradicted remarks that administration officials 
had made last friday indicating a decision had been made to expand 
the us role to allow american warships to protect neutral vessels 
under attack 
officials who declined to be named publicly said last week 
that a more aggressive us policy in the gulf had been decided 
upon they said such a policy was aimed at deterring iranian 
attacks against gulf shipping the change in policy they said at 
the time was a direct result of the mining of a us frigate and 
mondays extensive fighting between iranian and us forces 
but during his daily white house briefing today fitzwater 
talked of the possibility of returning us forces in the gulf to 
the limited rules of engagement that applied before last monday 
when the united states attacked two iranian platforms and the two 
nations forces subsequently exchanged fire 
while the spokesman emphasized that several options remained 
under study fitzwater indicated a concern within the 
administration about an americanization of the iraniraq war 
right now the rules of engagement are essentially the same as 
they were last week reflecting the emergency nature of the 
situation he said but the question is where do we move back 
to but i cant discuss specifics 
secretary of state george p shultz interviewed from brussels 
belgium on nbctvs today program also indicated a us 
interest in restraining the role of american military involvement 
in the gulf 
we will not get tied up in any serious shooting war with the 
iranians shultz said he added that the final decision is up to 
reagan and that it hasnt yet been made 
as far as our rules of engagement are concerned what the 
right ones are for this stage of the game in the gulf are being 
considered in washington and there is a process of consultation 
going on and i think its premature to describe them in any 
particular way shultz said 
fitzwater said that during the conflict last monday the rules 
of engagement were changed to accommodate the military situation 
that was encountered 
youll recall at that point that our ships were engaging 
hostile forces in any number of areas and we now want to move back 
to our conservative set of rules and so that decision has to be 
made about where to move back to he said you see the rules 
were changed to accommodate the military aggression that was 
encountered that day once that is no longer the case we want to 
move to something that would be more sustainable in the long term 
among the options being examined is adding coast guard ships to 
assist the us navy fleet in the persian gulf where an iranian 
gunboat attack on a neutral vessel drew a muted reaction from us 
officials sunday 
adm william crowe chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said 
the attack on a saudiowned tanker reflected a level of violence 
much less than in the mining incident that touched off last 
weeks us retaliatory strike against two iranian offshore 
platforms 
we consider our response on monday a suitable response for the 
indiscriminate mining and we do not contemplate any more violence 
unless iran continues what we would say is an indiscriminate and a 
threatening pattern crowe said on cbstvs face the nation 
the captain of the saudiowned sea trader said there were no 
casualties but the ship suffered slight damage in the grenade and 
machine gun attack at 730 am sunday 1130 pm edt saturday 
on the option of adding coast guard vessels defense secretary 
frank carlucci said the use of the crafts would provide more 
flexibility in the gulf but no decision has been made 
they have somewhat smaller ships which give a better 
patrolling capability it would free our larger ships for other 
missions carlucci said on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley 
crowe said coast guard vessels would be ideal for assisting 
warships in the escort of merchant vessels watching sea lanes to 
prevent minelaying and guarding offshore installations from 
attacks by small craft 
the coast guard vessels the pentagon may send to the gulf are 
lightly armed islandclass patrol craft now used mainly against 
drug traffic in the caribbean the service said today 
the 110foorlong ships travel at a maximum speed of 26 knots 
and carry two officers two chief petty officers and an additional 
crew of up to 14 
the ships are armed with one 20 mm machine gun in the front and 
two 762 mm machine guns elsewhere said spokesman nicholas 
sandifer janes fighting ships says each craft can carry an 
additional 20 mm machine gun 
the united states remains officially neutral in the 7yearold 
iraniraq war although it used us warships to guard 
americanflagged kuwaiti tankers from attacks since last summer 
the iranian attack on the sea trader came hours after reagan in 
his weekly radio address warned iran that continued military and 
terrorist attacks against nonbelligerents and refusal to negotiate 
an end to the war will be very costly to iran and its people

kraft inc wants to dig up the remains 
of members of several farm families and move them to an established 
cemetery but some local officials are fighting the plans 
these were the settlers of our community this site should not 
be disturbed said northfield township supervisor gregg goslin 
we are looking at an irreplaceable part of this communitys 
history he said recently as he picked his way through underbrush 
surrounding the cemetery northwest of chicago 
goslin said he is trying to persuade kraft officials to change 
their plans to uproot the overgrown cemetary in order to construct 
a new office building 
but kraft doesnt want the abandoned and long neglected 
cemetery in its front yard said spokeswoman magnes welsh 
the cemetary hasnt had a new burial since june 1924 many of 
the headstones are no longer legible and are partly covered with 
earth 
the company wants to dig up the graves and move them to an 
established cemetery she said 
but kraft needs permission from the northfield township board of 
trustees before it moves the remains of the estimated 20 people 
buried there 
the board has scheduled a public hearing on the request for next 
month

the security council voted 140 today to 
condemn the assassination of plo deputy commander khalil alwazir 
the united states abstained from voting it could have vetoed 
the resolution 
tunisian officials and israeli sources say israeli commandos 
gunned down wazir the palestine liberation organizations 
52yearold military commander at his home in suburban tunis on 
april 16 israel has neither confirmed nor denied the allegations 
the security council resolution condemns the slaying but does 
not explicitly criticize israel however the resolution approved 
today does refer to a 1985 resolution passed after israel bombed 
plo headquarters in tunis the 1985 measure condemned israel and 
demanded that it refrain from further acts of aggression 
us ambassador herbert okun said the united states could not 
vote in favor of the resolution today because it lays all the blame 
on israel without taking note of arab aggression against the jewish 
state 
he also praised tunisia as a peaceful nation and a friend of the 
united states 
the perpetration of politic assassination on tunisian soil 
stands in stark contrast to tunisias longstanding tradition of 
nonviolence he said 
both tunisia and the plo expressed satisfaction with the us 
abstention the united states generally uses its veto to shield 
israel in the council 
scores of speakers harshly condemned israel for practicing state 
terrorism and warned that wazirs murder would not end the unrest 
in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
wazir known as abu jihad was the mastermind of the 
4monthold palestinian uprising in the territories 
his slaying has served as a catalyst for possible reconciliation 
between syria and the plo something many arab leaders believe 
could help forge arab unity 
plo leader yasser arafat and syrian president hafez assad met 
today in damascus only their second facetoface meeting since 
arafat was expelled from syria in 1983 
council members who belong to the movement of nations professing 
nonalignment with either superpower algeria argentina nepal 
senegal yugoslavia and zambia sponsored the resolution on 
tunisias complaint 
the other current council members are the soviet union britain 
france china brazil italy japan and west germany

clinically she seems fine 
lab technicians with the coroners office were analyzing the 
suspected pesticide to determine what it is and how it would affect 
a human body el paso county coroner dr david bowerman said 
the alleged attempted poisoning occurred during the end of 
visiting hours saturday guthrie said 
a hospital employee came into the room to do a blood drawing 
on another patient and happened to see what was going on said

the supreme court today turned down an appeal 
by native hawaiians who say plans for developing geothermal energy 
in a volcanic area will violate their religious rights 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the proposed 
development will not interfere unlawfully with access to sacred 
land by worshippers of the goddess pele 
the native hawaiians said the development by turning a 
pristine virgin rain forest into a spiderweb of pipelines roads 
geothermal wells and production plants would by accepted 
religious doctrine destroy the goddess pele 
pele was described as the magma the heat the vapor the 
steam and the cosmic creation which occur in volcanic eruptions 
she is seen by pele people in the lava images of her standing 
erect dancing and extending her arms with her hair flowing into 
the steam and clouds 
at issue are more than 9000 acres of land in an area called the 
kilauea middle east rift zone on the island of hawaii 
the hawaii supreme court ruled in july that state officials did 
not infringe on the religious practices of the natives by setting 
aside the land for geothermal development 
the state court noted that the development site was moved about 
five to 10 miles from a location where tradition suggests pele 
resides the state court said the natives failed to prove 
significant harm would be done to their religious practices 
but the worshippers of pele said it is impossible to identify 
the precise sacred areas where they are commanded by the goddess to 
conduct private ceremonial rituals the precise sites are revealed 
by mysterious signs they said 
the supreme court last week ruled in a similar case from 
california that roadbuilding and timberharvesting in a national 
forest does not violate indians freedom of religion even if land 
they consider sacred is altered 
the case acted on today is dedman vs hawaii board of land and 
natural resources 87605

police arrested jerusalem wholesalers monday 
who were said to be helping the palestinian rebellion in the 
occupied lands and soldiers confiscated identity cards of several 
dozen arabs accused of inciting violence 
military spokesmen said a navy patrol craft sank a rubber boat 
off the lebanese coast before dawn killing an undetermined number 
of palestinian guerrillas israel radio said two guerrillas were in 
the boat 
israel radio said loss of their documents would prevent the gaza 
strip palestinians from entering israel it said the arabs also 
were ordered to check in with gaza police twice a day 
at least 173 palestinians have been killed since riots began 
dec 8 among the 15 million arabs of the occupied west bank and 
gaza which israel captured from jordan and egypt in the 1967 war 
an israeli soldier and jewish settler also have been killed 
violence has declined in the past few days and palestinians are 
expressing frustration with the failure of underground leaders to 
provide enough financial aid to offset economic sanctions imposed 
by the israelis 
the palestinians are asking where is all the support money the 
underground leadership said it would provide said mubarak awad 
an arabamerican who promotes nonviolent resistance to israeli 
rule 
he added however the people are frustrated but they arent 
giving up 
soldiers ordered shops in bethlehem and jerusalem to stay closed 
monday afternoon underground leaders of the palestine liberation 
organizaation leaders told them to open 
soldiers in bethlehem welded shut the doors of six shops that 
followed plo instructions in jerusalem police arrested 14 
merchants who opened their shops 
whoever is given an order must follow it said avi cohen a 
senior jerusalem police official who watched riot police and 
officers on horseback close the stores on the street of the 
prophets near the walled old city 
the 14 shop owners could face up to two years in jail they 
opened their stores across from the damascus gate at 2 pm 
abiding by the plo order and police closed them three minutes 
later 
israeli authorities want arab merchants to open all day but 
leaders of the rebellion have ordered stores opened only in the 
afternoon army instructions monday were that shops on the street 
of the prophets remain closed 
cohen said indictments will be handed up in a few days and 
the matter will be brought before the court 
a merchant who locked his shop while watched by police said 
theres no law which says when you must open or close 
crowds of shoppers patronized open shops on nearby streets 
when asked why the street of the prophets was singled out cohen 
replied you have to start somewhere but nabil feidy a 
merchant on saladin street close by said those arrested were 
wholesalers who supplied essential goods to the west bank to help 
keep the rebellion going 
they are the ones who send all kinds of flour to the refugee 
camps he said 
other arabs speaking on condition of anonymity also said the 
14 merchants had supplied goods to underground committees that run 
the rebellion 
dr hyder abdulshafi a prominent physician in the gaza strip 
said soldiers there in addition to confiscating identity cards 
were forcing people to report to tax offices even if they did not 
owe taxes 
they have to wait on line for hours and hours standing in the 
sun he said its the name of the game they are putting 
pressure on residents they are trying to make them give up 
prime minister yitzhak shamir was quoted as calling for action 
against two american journalists who did not submit to the military 
censor stories about israeli involvement in the assassination of 
plo military commander khalil wazir 
foreign journalists are required to give the censor any material 
involving security matters 
israeli newspapers quoted defense sources as saying authorities 
were considering expelling martin fletcher of nbc and glenn frankel 
of the washington post but israel radio quoted shamir as 
indicating lighter measures 
maybe they should not be expelled from the country but they 
should be punished the radio quoted shamir as saying 
fletcher made the first reports of israeli involvement in 
wazirs killing april 16 in tunis and frankel reported details of 
the operation israeli sources have said wazir was killed by 
israeli commandos but the government has not confirmed it

a call by afghanistans president najib for 
better relations with the united states is absurd the state 
department said monday 
in an interview with a 12member private us delgation parts 
of which were published monday in the washington post najib said 
he was ready for any kinds of compromise with the usbacked 
rebels trying to topple his sovietbacked government 
one possible compromise is for the return of exiled king 
mohammed zahir to act as a rallying point for a broadbased 
government that would run the country after the soviets withdraw 
their troops he said 
moscow which sent elements of the red army into afghanistan in 
1979 has undertaken to start pulling out some 115000 troops on 
may 15 under a unmediated accord 
all the conditions are now present and i think the americans 
could play a great role najib was quoted as saying we want to 
live in friendship with the united states of america without losing 
any element of our friendship with the soviet union 
but a state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said that 
since the united states views the sovietappointed najib government 
as illegitimate i think the question of our improving relations 
with it is absurd 
she labeled najibs comments soviet propaganda 
in his talk with the americans mostly retired officials and 
us business executives najib also said he would only accept a 
cutoff of soviet aid to his government if the us stopped aiding 
its rebel allies 
that comment we also view as absurd of equating soviet aid to 
the regime in kabul with us assistance to the government of 
pakistan mrs oakley said 
the united states has said it would stop arming and financing 
the seven rebel groups if the soviets end their support for the 
najib government 
mrs oakley said the delegation went to kabul strictly in a 
private capacity and has no sanction whatsoever from the us 
government 
in fact before the group members departed for kabul we 
recommended that they not make the trip and alerted them to the 
likelihood that the afghan and soviet propaganda organs would 
exploit their activities 
this is the first us delegation to visit afghanistan since the 
1979 soviet incursion robert e white who heads the group said 
after the najib interview that the afghan government would have to 
share power with the rebels before any change could be made in ties 
with the united states 
two members of the group boycotted the 80minute interview to 
show their disapproval for najib and their support for the rebels 
the post said

consideration by the pentagon to give the 
financially strapped coast guard a role in persian gulf patrols ran 
into heavy sailing monday on capitol hill 
ridiculous harebrained absolute utter nonsense was the 
reaction of sen alfonse damato rny who has criticized the 
reagan administration for not devoting more resources to battle 
against drugs including seizures of imports 
ive never heard of anything so stupid damato told a 
reporter do they think the war on drugs is over 
sen mark hatfield of oregon ranking republican on the senate 
appropriations committee said i dont know what the rationale 
for that would be weve put a lot of additional burdens on the 
coast guard in the last few years and id think they have a full 
plate 
the committee will meet later this week to consider shifting 
money to the coast guard because the service has responded to a 
100 million budget shortfall by suspending routine search and 
rescue patrols and cutting antidrug missions by 55 percent 
they dont have to go to the persian gulf to get money said 
hatfield 
pentagon officials said in weekend that consideration was being 
given to send up to a halfdozen 110foot coast guard patrol boats 
to the persian gulf they would be part of the us policy of 
protecting 11 reflagged kuwaiti tankers against attacks by iran 
the lightly armed island class patrol boats would be pulled 
off antidrug patrols in the caribbean coast guard officials said 
monday the boats would be replaced by new coast guard cutters now 
under construction 
nicholas sandifer a coast guard spokesman said any effect on 
drug interdiction would be minimal and temporary 
defense secretary frank carlucci said sunday that moving the 
patrol boats to the gulf would free our larger navy ships for 
other missions 
adm william crowe jr chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
said the coast guard ships could help escort merchant ships watch 
sea lanes prevent minelaying and guard offshore installations 
from smallboat attacks 
crowe admitted that if the boats are needed for antidrug 
patrols that need would severely complicate the calculus 
adm paul a yost commandant of the coast guard said monday 
the service could be ready to send patrol boats to the gulf region 
in 60 days 
if the president chairman of the joint chiefs think those 
boats would be a help over there im more than delighted to send 
them and my coast guard personnel are ready to go yost told 
reporters really raring and ready to go 
administratively the coast guard is part of the transportation 
department but by law the agency also falls under defense 
department jurisdiction for national security purposes 
congressional sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the navy has offered to pay the coast guards expenses in mounting 
the gulf patrols 
the coast guard has been hit hard by budget cuts that have 
resulted from deficitreduction efforts the service has a 27 
billion budget this year which yost says is 100 million less than 
needed 
as result the coast guard in february closed almost 30 stations 
and offices cut antidrug patrols and halted routine rescue 
patrols 
the administration last month came up with a plan to shift money 
within the transportation department and permit more antidrug 
patrols that proposal has yet to be approved by congress 
the island class boats that would be used in the gulf 
operations have a maximum speed of more than 26 knots and carry a 
crew of 16 according to sandifer the vessels are armed with one 
20mm machine gun in the front and two 762mm machine guns 
elsewhere another 20mm machine gun can be added 
sen john glenn dohio a member of the armed services 
committee said those boats could be good but they dont have 
any of their own defense against missiles and thats what our ships 
are running into these days in the gulf 
im willing to look at the proposal but as of right now it 
doesnt make a lot of sense said glenn i hate to see us pull 
the coast guard off drug work 
last fall the pentagon considered sending coast guard vessels 
to the gulf but decided against the idea in part because the 
boats are so lightly armed 
iran has attacked shipping with a variety of boats particularly 
speedboats the iranians have at least two dozen swedishmade 
boghammer boats which have been armed with machine guns and 
rocket launchers

president hafez assad and plo chairman 
yasser arafat met monday seeking to end five years of bloody 
rivalry and to revive a hardline alliance against israel and a us 
peace plan 
presidential spokesman jibrane kourieh said the two key arab 
leaders met for 3 hours in assads muhajirine palace and talked in 
particular about the palestinian uprising in israel and the need to 
support it 
we all agreed that this is a rare opportunity that would 
lead to the restoration of warm relations between syria and the 
plo palestinian leader nayef hawatmeh said before the meeting 
it was the second time that arafat and assad have talked 
facetoface since the syrian president threw the plo leader out of 
syria in june 1983 they met briefly at the arab summit in amman 
jordan in november 
if their talks are successful it will mean the end of a rift 
that seriously hampered arab efforts to unite in opposition to 
israel 
syrias foreign minister farouk alsharaa and seven of arafats 
senior aides all members of the ruling central committee of 
fatah the main plo guerrilla group attended the meeting in the 
heavily guarded palace the spokesman said 
like arafat most of them had not visited damascus since arafat 
was expelled at the height of a syrianbacked mutiny in the plo 
arafats aides arrived in damascus last week for the funeral of 
the plos military commander khalil wazir assassinated in tunis 
tunisia on april 16 
israeli sources have said wazir was killed by israeli commandos 
but the government has not confirmed it 
arafat failed to show up for the funeral wednesday and flew in 
sunday from libya after libyan leader col moammar gadhafi and 
algerian president chadli benjedid intervened 
mondays crucial session followed a meeting between assad and a 
ranking libyan envoy lt col mustafa kharroubi who accompanied 
arafat from tripoli to damascus on sunday officials released no 
details of that meeting 
hawatmeh who leads the marxist democratic front for the 
liberation of palestine said that arafats threehour session with 
palestinian leaders hammered out an agenda for the future 
hawatmeh said the top priorities were the palestinian uprising 
against israeli occupation in the west bank and gaza strip and the 
united states latest middle east peace plan presented to the 
regions leaders last month by secretary of state george p shultz 
these are two very important developments how to bolster the 
uprising and foil shultzs plan hawatmeh said 
syria and the plo have separately rejected shultzs proposal for 
limited palestinian selfrule in the occupied territories both 
want an independent palestinian state in the west bank and gaza 
the peace plan also does not give the plo a role in the peace 
process 
arabs however regard the plo as the sole representative of the 
worlds 5 million palestinians 
asked if it was not too early to talk of an alliance when arafat 
has been in damascus only 24 hours hawatmeh declared the fact 
that hes here means the feud is over 
now we have to move on to the next stage reviving the 
strategic alliance 
libya and algeria along with syria the plo and marxist south 
yemen formed what was called the arab steadfastness front after 
the late president anwar sadat of egypt signed the 1978 
usbrokered camp david accord that led to a peace treaty with 
israel a year later 
the antipeace accord alliance fell apart when the syriaplo 
feud began 
the feud erupted after israel invaded lebanon in 1982 
arafat at that time refused to set up headquarters in damascus 
and began looking into the prospects of negotiating peace with 
israel 
that angered assad and plo radicals who advocated armed 
struggle against israel 
in may 1983 the friction exploded into a battle between 
arafats supporters and syrianbacked hardliners seeking to oust 
the guerrilla chief from the plo leadership 
arab leaders have been trying to reconcile assad and arafat 
since the split but wazirs assassination accelerated the process 
the 52yearold native of ramle now in israel was respected by 
both arafat loyalists and prosyrian dissidents 
he was said to be the mastermind of the palestinian uprising in 
the occupied territories and his death was a severe blow to the 
plo underscoring israels military might

a contra leader threatened monday to end the 
upcoming peace talks unless the sandinistas immediately allow us 
humanitarian aid to reach the guerrillas and a top nicaraguan 
official met secretly here with the rebels 
contra director adolfo calero said the truce arrangement reached 
last month in sapoa nicaragua would be in danger if the 
sandinistas continue to block food and medical supplies to rebel 
troops inside that central american country 
calero also acknowledged monday the contents of an april 10 
internal contra memo obtained by the associated press 
his forces position was difficult calero said adding that 
immediate delivery of food and humanitarian supplies must be the 
first priority in the talks scheduled to begin thursday in managua 
the internal memo writen by the contra field officer known as 
cmdr johnson said we urgently need that humanitariantype aid be 
permitted to the troops who are in a critical situation 
we must reach an agreement on that said calero if that 
is not done the whole sapoa agreement will collapse 
he said the contras have three private us companies available 
to rush the supplies to nicaragua as soon as the sandinistas agree 
some of the aid approved by congress was already on its way to 
refugee camps on the hondurannicaraugan border he added 
and in preparation for thursdays toplevel negotiations in 
nicaragua sandinista deputy foreign minister victor tinoco arrived 
secretly in miami to discuss the agenda and arrangments for the 
talks calero confirmed 
tinoco was to meet at an undisclosed location monday with the 
contra directors secretary said calero but was not expected to 
meet facetoface with the five directors 
tinoco has previously accused the contras of engaging in 
political maneuvering to avoid a definitive ceasefire while they 
receive us aid 
we have serious doubts they want to enter into a definitive 
ceasefire tinoco said in nicaragua on april 13 they simply 
want to move into zones which means gains for them without a 
threat with security and to gain the release of 50 percent of the 
prisoners american aid and participation in politics 
the plight of the troops has been said to be a contributing 
cause to a reported rift among the contra leaders but monday 
calero downplayed the differences among the five directors 
he denied leading a movement to fire top military chief enrique 
bermudez but acknowledged two other rebel field comanders tono 
and fernando walter calderon and diogenes hernandez had 
objected to the peace talks he also said when asked about a 
contra shakeup that three top civilian employees of the rebel 
troops had been replaced by military officials 
he insisted however that there was still unity among the 
directors of the nicaraguan resistance as the contras are formally 
called 
all five directors including aristides sanchez who skipped the 
last meeting with the sandinistas in managua for personal 
reasons will fly to nicaragua for this weeks negotiations 
calero said 
he denied infighting between himself and sanchez who some 
sources say has the backing of bermudez and many field commanders 
but acknowledged that tactical differences existed among the contra 
leaders just as they did among the sandinistas

the supreme court on monday let stand an 
arizona telephone companys ban on sexually explicit dialup 
message services 
in the first dialaporn case to reach the high court the 
justices without comment declined to hear arguments that mountain 
bells refusal to carry sexually explicit message services violates 
freespeech rights 
the courts action came a week after congress sent to president 
reagan a bill that would ban all dialaporn services which are 
available to callers through 976 exchanges and atampts 900 
longdistance lines 
state governments also have been working to limit availability 
of dialaporn services and last week the federal communications 
commission fined two california dialaporn companies 600000 each 
for allegedly failing to prevent children from hearing their 
messages 
the supreme courts action clearly puts the ball in the phone 
companies court said bradley keirnes vice president of 
citizens for decency through law inc a phoenix arizbased 
public interest law firm specializing in obscenity law 
keirnes said phone companies now have a green light to pull 
the plug on dialaporn services without fear of violating the 
companies first amendment rights 
rep thomas j bliley jr rva who spearheaded the move in 
the house to approve a dialaporn ban said the courts action 
bolsters his belief that such a ban will withstand a court test 
it indicates the thinking of the court which is that this 
kind of speech is not protected by the first amendment he said 
mountain bell a us west company was pleased with the decision 
but the parent company is not considering extending the arizona ban 
to the 13 other states in its territory a spokesman said 
in arizona dialaporn services were particularly harmful to 
our reputation so we felt that a ban was the most appropriate 
action for arizona but there are different circumstances in 
different states said us west spokesman blair johnson 
in its other states us west is offering customers onetime 
free blocking of 976 services establishing a separate prefix for 
dialaporn services and is no longer billing or collecting for 
these services 
we think those will be effective and give parents a tool to 
keep children from gaining access to these types of services 
johnson said 
pacific bell spokeswoman sandy hale said her company will 
review our position in light of the supreme courts action to see 
if there are direct implications 
other bell companies and american telephone amp telegraph co had 
no comment on the supreme court action 
mountain bell in 1985 banned from its 976 network all businesses 
that provide adult entertainment messages with sexually oriented 
content 
the policy was challenged by carlin communications inc and 
sapphire communications inc as impeding their freedom of speech 
only the government or some agent of the government can violate 
someones constitutional rights so the two companies argued that 
mountain bells policy represented a state action 
they said that because mountain bell is a heavily regulated 
public utility that had been pressured by state authorities to pull 
the plug on dialaporn services the companys action amounted to 
an action of the state 
a federal trial judge ruled that mountain bell could not refuse 
to carry the dialaporn messages but the 9th us circuit court 
of appeals reversed that ruling last year saying mountain bells 
action did not amount to a state action 
new york attorney lawrence abelman representing carlin did not 
return a telephone call for comment sapphire is a subsidiary of 
carlin 
a similar decision by another federal appeals court previously 
enabled southern bell to rid its 976 networks of dialaporn 
services in florida georgia north carolina and south carolina

president reagans spokesman suggested monday 
that the administration wants to return us forces in the persian 
gulf to the limited rules of engagement that existed before last 
weeks shooting with iran 
while emphasizing that no decisions have been made on how 
american naval power will be used in the wake of last mondays 
exchanges with iran spokesman marlin fitzwater said everybody 
acknowledges that we need to move back to some more limited set of 
rules 
fitzwaters statement buttressed remarks that secretary of state 
george p shultz made in brussels belgium where american 
officials were consulting with nato allies on persian gulf strategy 
and other issues 
we will not get tied up in any serious shooting war with the 
iranians shultz said in an interview on nbctvs today show 
he said the question of what rules should govern us military 
activities in the gulf remained unresolved saying thats the 
kind of decision that the president makes 
the tone of the comments by fitzwater and shultz differed with 
assessments provided late last week by other administration 
officials those officials who spoke on condition they not be 
named had said the administration decided to expand its policy to 
allow us warships to aid neutral merchant ships under attack 
but those officials said the rules of engagement would not be 
expanded far enough to allow a broadbased us escort for 
nonamericanflagged vessels in the gulf 
the talk of a change in policy came as a direct result of the 
mining of a us frigate and last mondays extensive fighting 
between iranian and us forces at the same time adm william 
crowe chairman of the joint chiefs of staff confirmed over the 
weekend that us officials were considering using coast guard 
vessels in the gulf 
but on monday fitzwater talked of the possibility of returning 
us forces to the limited rules of engagement that applied before 
last mondays clash rules which provide for measured responses to 
the laying of mines or other iranian provocations 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee had voiced fear about an increasing americanization of 
the iraniraq war and there has been a move in congress to revise 
provisions of the war powers act that limit the ability of 
lawmakers to act 
reagan consulted with congressional leaders in advance of the 
military strikes he ordered a week ago and he wrote a letter 
calling the matter closed in the aftermath of the exchanges 
but the administration has taken the position that elements of the 
war powers act are unconsitutional and has refused to invoke a 
provision that would give lawmakers a chance to vote within 60 days 
on whether to keep us troops in the region 
the administration also is consulting members of congress in 
connection with a reassessment of the rules of engagement in the 
gulf 
while fitzwater stressed that several options remain under study 
in the gulf he said right now the rules of engagement are 
essentially the same as they were last week reflecting the 
emergency nature of the situation but the question is where do we 
move back to i cant discuss specifics 
shultz told interviewers that as far as our rules of 
engagement are concerned what the right ones are for this stage of 
the game in the gulf are being considered in washington and there 
is a process of consultation going on and i think its premature

fitzwater said the rules of engagement were expanded a week ago 
to accommodate the military situation that was encountered 
after navy forces bombarded two iranian oil platforms in reprisal 
for the mining of the uss samuel b roberts the week before 
youll recall at that point that our ships were engaging 
hostile forces in any number of areas fitzwater said and we 
now want to move back to our conservative set of rules and so that 
decision has to be made about where to move back to 
the rules were changed to accommodate the military aggression 
that was encountered that day he said once that is no longer 
the case we want to move to something that would be more 
sustainable in the long term

former continental illinois national bank officer 
john lytles luxurious lifestyle and mounting personal debts led 
him to scheme with two oklahoma men to defraud the bank 
prosecutors said monday at his trial 
by the summer of 1981 lytle lived a lifestyle virtually fit 
for a king like the lifestyle of the rich and famous 
assistant us attorney ted helwig contended during closing 
arguments 
lytle tulsa oil driller jere sturgis and william patterson 
former head of oil and gas lending at the failed penn square bank 
of oklahoma city are charged with participating in a scheme to 
defraud continental 
lytle a former continental vice president is accused of taking 
kickbacks in exchange for funding and attempting to fund highrisk 
energy loans from continental illinois national bank amp trust co to 
penn square customers

37 are charged with wire fraud and misapplication of bank funds

us district judge milton shadur is presiding over the trial 
which is into its sixth week 
the indictment cites lytles involvement in 44 million in loans 
made by continental to 12 penn square customers it does not say 
how much was recovered by the chicago bank which came to the brink 
of collapse in 1984 in part because of its troubled energy loans 
continental was rescued with a 45 billion federal bailout 
those loans were approved in 1981 and 1982 at about the same 
time helwig charges that lytle received nearly 600000 in 
kickbacks from patterson in the form of unsecured personal loans 
from penn square 
he said lytle a 20year continental veteran who oversaw the 
banks oil and gas lending in oklahoma needed the money because he 
was living well beyond his means 
he had a home he was doubling in size vacations two vacation 
homes and 565000 from the penn square bank that he used to buy 
cars furs and jewelry 
he had become so completely dependent on bill patterson he no 
longer had the interest of continental first and foremost helwig 
said 
lytle impassive during government arguments took notes he sat 
facing the jury wearing a brown suit and scuffed penny loafers 
one with a hole in the sole

november when thenmayor harold washington the citys first black 
mayor died after suffering a massive heart attack in his office

by thee or not by thee that was the question 
which swirled around a poem that an oxford university professor 
said is by william shakespeare but other scholars rejected as false 
im convinced it is by shakespeare said oxfords professor 
of poetry peter levi as he held up a photocopy of the untitled 
poem at the center of the tempest 
levi called a news conference monday four days after his claim 
emerged in a london newspaper to introduce a 28page book he has 
written to prove the poem was written by the bard 
counters professor stanley wells director of the shakespeare 
institute at birmingham university i do not think for one moment 
it is by him 
the controversy had spread to the huntington library in san 
marino calif which has the disputed poem some experts claim the 
issue is not new that the poem has been known of since 1801 and 
some say its not up to shakespearean standards 
levi has support from a manuscript scholar eric sams who says 
the poem may even be in shakespeares handwriting 
i dont terribly mind what happens to my reputation said 
levi it would be a terrible act of cowardice not to have printed 
as a poem of shakespeare what other people were too idle or too 
silly to notice 
he said he first read the untitled poem when he asked the 
huntington library for photocopies of several manuscripts for his 
shakespeare biography 
the poem is pasted in the back of a manuscript volume containing 
a play by john marston a dramatist contemporary of shakespeare 
and bears initials that could be wsh or wsk 
i think it is w sh otherwise why would marston have 
written it levi said 
without that signature i would not have been absolutely 
certain but no one disputes that the writing is marstons and i 
believe he was appending the initials of the poems author 
asked why the poem had been neglected since shakespeare died in 
1616 levi commented i cant imagine the verses have movement 
like the end of the tempest they recall as you like it and 
antony and cleopatra 
they are exactly what shakespeare might have turned out 
said levi 56 who has published 12 books of his own poems and 
written or edited 25 others 
the poem consists of tributes to be spoken by 14 identified 
ladies presenting gifts to anne chandos at her betrothal party in 
1607 
levi cited this verse to prove the poem was worthy of englands 
greatest poet 
witty pretty virtuous and fair 
compounded all of fire and air 
sweet measure not my thought and me 
by golden fruit from fruitless tree 
thats beautiful it could be shakespeare and i think the 
whole thing is by him the professor said 
levi said he worked from photocopies of the poem because i 
cannot afford to jump on a plane to california i am poorly paid 
lord stockton chairman of macmillan publishers handed 
reporters copies of levis book about the poem a private 
commission new verses by shakespeare 
i regard this as the literary event of the decade and perhaps 
of the whole period since world war ii stockton said 
al rowse a renowned elizabethan scholar wrote in londons 
evening standard newspaper monday that the levi verses were quite 
good but they are simple and direct and lack shakespeares 
elusiveness and imagery 
james knowles an oxford research student who independently 
investigated the poems authenticity said he doesnt believe 
shakespeare wrote it and he will publish his views friday 
i am not merely indulging in scholarly skepticism when i say i 
do not think the verse is shakespeares said birminghams wells 
i do not think levi made anything of a case because he seems to 
be saying that because it is good it must be shakespeares that 
is a subjective judgment 
there were masses of other poets capable of writing good 
poetry and there were other poets whose initials were ws he said 
in an interview 
sara hodson a curator at the huntington said the undated 
marston book and the inserted poem were dated to the 17th century 
by the paper ink handwriting and binding 
it has been in the library since 1917 at least one other 
scholar and probably more have wondered about the shakespeare 
connection she said

a judge sentenced john demjanjuk on monday to 
die for nazi war crimes and said the retired ohio autoworker 
personally killed tens of thousands of people as the sadistic death 
camp guard ivan the terrible 
hundreds of spectators jumped to their feet and applauded some 
shouted bravo and others death death survivors of the 
holocaust in which 6 million jews were killed cried and embraced 
each other 
judge zvi tal said demjanjuks crimes at the treblinka death 
camp in nazioccupied poland could never be forgiven by the 
hearts of men or be obliterated from memory the blood of the 
victims still cries out to us 
ivan the terrible operated the gas chambers at treblinka 
where 850000 jews were killed in 194243 demjanjuk was convicted 
last week 
the judge who was born in poland and lost his parents in the 
holocaust said demjanjuk served as an arch henchman who with his 
own hands killed tens of thousands of human beings he humiliated 
and degraded his victims 
minutes before the sentence was read demjanjuk shouted in 
hebrew im an innocent man 
demjanjuk 68 was in a wheelchair because of back problems he 
is a ukrainian orthodox christian and crossed himself repeatedly 
and muttered apparently in prayer 
the 14month trial in a converted movie theater was only the 
second in israel of someone charged with nazi crimes more than 
250000 people attended and sessions were broadcast live on radio 
and television 
adolf eichmann who directed adolf hitlers program for 
exterminating jews was tried in israel and hanged in 1962 he is 
the only person to have been executed in israel since it bedcame a 
nation in 1948 
court spokesman yossi hassin said demjanjuk also probably would 
be executed by hanging if the sentence is upheld on appeal 
john demjanjuk jr the defendants 22yearold son sobbed 
silently he said the family had expected a death sentence and 
would appeal within days 
this amounts to nothing more than the judicial murder of an 
innocent man he said 
it will bring shame to the state of israel the israeli 
justice department the us justice department and most 
unfortunately the 6 million victims of the nazi holocaust he 
said the united state extradited demjanjuk to israel 
in lorain ohio the rev john bruchok of st marys ukrainian 
orthodox church said its a travesty of justice bruchok met 
the defendant when the family asked for a priest shortly before 
demjanjuk was sent to israel 
i saw his face bruchok said i saw the face of a gentle 
man who was scared an innocent man is being executed i believe 
this with all my heart it is very unfortunate 
josef czarny a treblinka survivor who testified for the 
prosecution said a thousand deaths cannot compensate for what 
happened but at least we have judged one of the angels of 
death 
pinchas epstein another survivor who testified hugged a 
relative and said i feel like a burden was lifted 
earlier in the day demjanjuk told the court in a calm clear 
voice you have made a grave mistake i do not deserve this 
i am innocent innocent innocent god is my witness 
in the 20th century how is it possible for such an injustice 
to be done he asked in ukrainian i am not ivan the terrible 
and to that god is the most just witness he knows i am innocent 
prosecutor yonah blattman said in his argument for the death 
penalty that demjanjuk was not a small cog in the nazi machine 
he was a major criminal 
demjanjuk pointed to his chest and repeatedly shook his head to 
blattmans allegations that he distinguished himself by the sheer 
brutality of his behavior he cut off breasts slashed faces 
beat in skulls 
he crossed himself each time blattman mentioned an atrocity 
causing murmurs among the 650 spectators 
defense lawyer john gill of cleveland said new evidence might 
come to light that would prove his client innocent and cited cases 
of wrongful conviction 
the death penalty is an irrevocable penalty imposed by 
fallible judges let not a second crime happen the taking of 
any innocent human life is a holocaust he said and there were 
gasps from the audience 
after the sentencing ashenfaced demjanjuk was ringed by 
police guards and wheeled from the courtroom 
he shouted to reporters before reaching a police van im an 
innocent man im not ivan the terrible i dont care what they 
the court did 
demjanjuk bumped his head as guards lifted him into the van he 
could be seen slumped in the wheelchair as the vehicle drove past 
jeering spectators

the white house said monday it regretted that 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev has taken strong exception to 
president reagans accurate and realistic assessment of 
ussoviet relations 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater acknowledged that 
reagans comments contained in a speech delivered thursday in 
springfield mass had irritated the soviet leader in advance of 
the may 29june 3 moscow summit 
according to a report by the soviet news agency tass gorbachev 
complained to secretary of state george p shultz about the 
presidents speech during a meeting last week in moscow 
gorbachev took reagan to task for criticizing soviet policy in 
afghanistan and on human rights the report said 
in his speech the president questioned whether the soviets had 
abandoned ambitions to control afghanistan and threaten 
pakistan despite the recent geneva accord outlining the soviet 
pullout he also said the soviets could never have truly normal 
relations with the united states as long as it violated human 
rights 
president reagans comments on eastwest relations in his 
springfield mass speech obviously struck a raw nerve with the 
general secretary fitzwater said when asked about gorbachevs 
comments 
the very harsh rhetoric used by tass to describe the 
presidents speech is most unfortunate we trust it does not signal 
a move away from the steadily improving relations that the soviet 
union has espoused in its recent past fitzwater said 
the spokesman contended that reagans comments signaled no 
change in us policy and defended the speech as accurate in 
terms of the way we view soviet intentions in countries such as 
afghanistan nicaragua and ethiopia 
fitzwater said there have been significant improvements in 
ussoviet relations in recent years particularly in the area of 
arms control but he added that reagan will continue to be 
realistic will continue to point out problems as well as 
positive developments 
asked by reporters why it had been appropriate for reagan to use 
tough language in describing soviet actions but not for gorbachev 
to do the same fitzwater said it seemed needlessly 
inflammatory 
but at another point the spokesman said the soviets have a 
right to say anything they want 
asked if the administration was pleased it had struck a raw 
nerve with reagans speech fitzwater replied i dont regret 
that it struck a nerve but i regret that it has caused this kind 
of personal feelings and trading of harsh language 
the spokesman said reagan wants to be realistic in terms of 
our relations especially as we approach a fourth summit 
as the president said in his speech a major test of soviet 
intentions is how they conduct their regional political affairs 
and hes simply saying thats going to be a part of our 
discussion fitzwater said 
he said it was reagans intention to point out the major 
issues that divide us and that two superpowers need to discuss 
openly and frankly at summits 
we think its a healthy sign that both countries are willing to 
face up to the realities of their problems in a summit 
atmosphere fitzwater added 
asked if the situation might put a strain on the upcoming summit 
between reagan and gorbachev he said i hope not you just never 
know

seven days a week when its sunny henry 
hasselhan sits alone in a closetsized room 100 feet in the air and 
stares into space 
but if a puff of smoke appears the fire tower observer must 
quickly spot it plot its location with help from another tower and 
report in by shortwave radio 
and in the heart of forest fire season hasselhan may do that 
several times a day 
from march 15 to may 15 when humidity is low and leaves have 
not yet covered bare trees to provide shade the warming sun may 
spontaneously ignite the dry forest floor said ben petrini an 
assistant warden with the state division of parks forestry and 
recreation 
hasselhans job may seem monotonous but his windowlined 
office has one of the finest views in all of southern new 
jersey it also sways in the wind 
sometimes it gets boring sometimes it gets very busy the 
33yearold atco resident said a lot of times you just sit here 
on rainy days you either go home or down to the shop to help work 
on the fire trucks 
tower watchers put in lighter hours during the summer then go 
back to the sevendayaweek routine for about a month in autumn 
when leaves fall and dry out they spend the winter in the forestry 
department shop building new fire trucks from the frame up the job 
pays 14000 to 20000 a year 
the curious sometimes ask to visit the towers and hasselhan 
never stops them 
a lot of them reach the third flight and cant make it because 
they get scared of the height he said 
at 945 am each day hasselhan checks the weather gauges at 
the foot of the tower then after catching his breath from the 
long climb up the staircase he checks in with petrini in the 
division c office in mays landing 
division c covers stillforested sections of southern new jersey 
including the pinelands and has six towers built in the 1930s 
scanning a total of roughly 100000 acres petrini said division a 
handles the northwestern corner of the state and division b has 
towers covering forests in the middle of the state 
as of monday more than 257 fires most of them minor have been 
doused in division c covering the states six southernmost 
counties 
a sheet on the towers wall lists nearby industries and power 
plants that emit smoke hasselhan points to a white cloud in the 
distance and explains it is from an asphalt plant 
i know the difference after sitting up here all this time 
he said you know what smoke looks like a house fire doesnt 
move and looks black a woods fire changes color and changes 
direction 
when hasselhan spots smoke he immediately calls another tower 
to confirm it they then locate the smoke with a surveying device 
and call the warden who sends out a firefighting team 
hasselhan has been a fire tower observer for almost four years 
the novelty of having a terrific view wore off quickly he said 
but the tower is just a preliminary stop in his career 
id rather be out fighting fires he said

it was very fortunate he said they must have had a 
friend upstairs

firefighters arrived a second more powerful explosion ripped 
through the paint store blowing out one wall and creating a 
fireball that rapidly spread to nearby structures 
cheryl mcmurray 33 and joe bell 44 were sitting at a dining 
table in a thirdfloor apartment above the store 
the floor went right out beneath us ms mcmurray said 
everything in the kitchen was shaking he bell had me by the 
hand and pulled me down the stairs it took us 20 seconds to get 
out the front door but the smoke was really intense 
by the time we got to the second floor it was really hot as 
soon as we got outside it went poof it just went poof 
caroline boatman who was at a bar a block and a half away said 
several bar patrons left with her and began shouting outside to 
awaken people in the neighborhood she said several people joined 
together to catch residents who jumped from windows when the 
building began collapsing 
i opened the window and some people were shouting to me i 
just jumped and they caught me said david bedwell 24 who 
jumped from the second flood in his underwear 
there was no fire yet but then david bedwell jumped out 
and others saw him and began jumping too ms boatman said 
it took five hours for 165 firefighters using 30 pieces of 
equipment to bring the fire under control authorities predicted it 
would be some time before investigators determined the cause

a 10000 bond couldnt hold a man who 
has since been accused of 194 counts of burglary so a judge has 
multiplied the defendants bond by 1000 to 10 million 
judge mike mcdonald said he did not realize dwight christopher 
had a record of past burglary convictions and had other charges 
pending when he set his bond at 10000 on march 4 after he was 
booked with a count of burglary 
he bonded out within an hour and a defense attorney caught him 
coming out the window of a house the next day mcdonald said 
sunday 
christopher 35 of baton rouge was arrested again on march 16 
and an investigation led to all the charges of committing 194 
burglaries since july 1987 to support an alleged 300 to 
500perday cocaine habit said police officer jeff wesley 
after learning that christopher had a fivepage rap sheet

the senate voted 4830 approval monday of a 
bill granting new benefits to an estimated 250000 atomic 
veterans who were exposed to radiation during the us nuclear 
attacks on japan in 1945 and in postwar nuclear tests 
the bill still requires house approval but the measure faces a 
veto threat from president reagan if it reaches his desk 
it is time to be fair to these men said sen alan cranston 
dcalif chairman of the senate veterans committee and chief 
sponsor of the bill 
the measure would cost an estimated 36 million in its first 
year to pay for medical treatments 
the atomic veterans are service personnel who either took part 
in the occupation of hiroshima and nagasaki after us atomic bombs 
were dropped on those japanese cities in august 1945 or who took 
part in openair tests of american atomic weapons in the pacific or 
nevada during the two decades after the war 
many of those veterans have developed cancer and have urged the 
veterans administration to make a presumptive finding that their 
cancers are related to their exposure to radiation during the 
tests many of the servicemen were exposed to radiation during the 
tests with little or no protective clothing 
the bill would include 13 specific types of cancer 
under existing law veterans with cancer can receive 
compensation but in each case they must show that the illness is 
servicerelated 
only 28 of the nearly 5000 veterans who have filed 
radiationrelated claims with the va have been approved for 
disability benefits 
originally the bill passed monday was part of a larger health 
and compensation bill for the nations 274 million veterans 
but the atomic veterans measure was so strongly opposed by 
the reagan administration that it was dropped because of a veto 
threat issued by the white house 
administration officials argue there is no scientific basis for 
presuming that the 13 types of cancers were caused by exposure to 
radiation during military service 
sen alan simpson rwyo said the bill just ignores sound 
medical scientific evidence its just an absurd approach 
toward compensation

the house passed and sent to president reagan 
on monday a bill providing for the prompt return of children 
abducted from a parent and taken to another country often by the 
other parent 
the measure approved by voice vote would implement an 
international treaty on child abduction that the united states 
signed in 1981 and the senate approved five years later 
the house which had passed an almost identical bill march 28 
approved on monday a slightly different senate version giving 
jurisdiction over international child abduction cases to both state 
and federal courts 
the measure is intended to remove difficult timeconsuming 
legal issues involved in returning children abducted to another 
country or helping foreign parents recover children wrongfully 
taken to the united states

thursday an encounter they believe can only help chirac 
by monday afternoon 99 percent of the vote had been counted 
lacking only returns from french polynesia 
former centerright premier raymond barre 64 who finished 
third with 166 percent immediately threw his support behind 
chirac 55 and called on his voters to do the same 
on monday the centrist union for french democracy which had 
backed barre also gave chirac its endorsement 
it was not clear however how many of barre supporters would 
actually vote for chirac polls indicate a significant number could 
cross over to mitterrand who has moved markedly to the center 
since becoming president in 1981 
le pen 59 whose campaign focused on curbing immigration and 
crime said he would wait until a major national front rally may 1 
to announce what counsel he would give his voters 
if chirac wants his votes le pen said he will have to announce 
concrete acts in the area of housing in the area of subsidies to 
immigrants and also in the area of family allocations 
one of the national fronts main arguments is that immigrants 
are taking french jobs overburdening the french welfare system and 
making less money available to help needy french citizens 
it is up to jacques chirac to define what electoral 
majority is possible for him le pen said then we will see if 
that jibes with what we feel it should be 
le pen said the vote of his supporters depended on their 
individual choice but he added it is certain that if i give a 
warm counsel it has a good chance of being widely followed 
chirac called a meeting of his cabinet on monday and told them 
it goes without saying that no negotiation will be held with 
anybody 
nonetheless the subject of immigration is popping up with 
increasing frequency in the remarks of both chirac and his aides 
he chirac already has taken on le pens themes and ideas 
said socialist party spokesman jeanjack queyranne will he also 
take the men and allow them ministerial portfolios 
chirac noted that sundays voting carried a message it is up 
to the conservative candidate to respond to the preoccupations of 
the french people to their expectations to their hopes such as 
they have been expressed by the vote 
alain juppe budget minister and spokesman for the chirac 
campaign said the national front performance was a message that 
was based on three or four ideas 
the first is that immigration is a problem of french society 
today and that we perhaps have not done enough in this area and 
that we must tackle the problem with respect to our values and our 
convictions he said 
juppe said chirac must rally a wide range of the french to 
avoid a new period of socialism of laxness and undoubted decline 
and political troubles for france 
francois leotard chiracs culture minister said the national 
front has indicated that things that are totally unacceptable for 
the immense majority of french and things which can be discussed 
let us try to make the distinction between all of that but 
without negotiating anything whatever with anybody xenophobia and 
racism are not for us 
lionel jospin first secretary of the socialist party said the 
voters had shown sunday that chirac does not inspire confidence 
they dont think that he can be president

secretary of state george p shultz on 
monday urged denmark to measure up to its nato responsibilities 
and to stop a resolution that would effectively ban allied ships 
from danish ports 
shultz met with danish foreign minister uffe ellemannjensen to 
restate us concerns about a danish parliament motion which 
demands that visiting warships not carry nuclear arms into danish 
harbors 
it constitutes a real problem shultz said of the april 14 
motion 
denmarks minority centerright government opposed the measure 
and has called for early elections may 10 
if you like the benefits of nato membership then you 
ought to like the responsibilities that go with making that 
possible shultz said 
he met with ellemannjensen after briefing nato foreign 
ministers on his talks last week in moscow with soviet leaders 
the talks were held to prepare for the may 29june 2 summit 
meeting between president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev shultz said prospects for a treaty by then to halve us 
and soviet strategic nuclear arms were dim 
its extremely difficult to get there there are hard issues 
to get at they involve a lot of pickandshovel work he said 
the issues deal with verification of compliance and counting 
different arms systems under a strategic arms reduction treaty 
shultz told reporters at nato headquarters 
he said he would continue negotiating after the summit in the 
last months of the reagan administration 
well keep at it were not going to stop he said citing 
broad bipartisan support for a start accord in the united 
states 
he denied superpower relations had slumped since last years 
signing of a treaty to remove hundreds of mediumrange nuclear 
missiles from europe 
citing moscows decision to withdraw its troops from 
afghanistan shultz said i think the picture is one in which we 
see general progress 
ellemannjensen said his government was looking to the may 10 
elections for an answer to the nato problem 
we want to get a clear message from our voters that they want 
denmark to remain a full member of the alliance he said if we 
get the signal from the voters we are asking for it will be 
possible to reach a fair solution 
that means denmark would stick by its current ban on nuclear 
arms on its soil but would not demand a declaration from visiting 
ships he said 
us and british warships as a matter of policy never say if 
their warships carry nuclear arms the danish resolution has led 
britain to suspend visits to denmark by royal navy vessels 
ellemannjensen said both the americans and the british have 
made it clear many times it would be necessary to discuss the full 
participation of denmark in military matters if we effectively 
banned allied warships from these two countries 
shultz said the parliamentary resolution while an internal 
danish matter has natowide implications norway also formally 
bans nuclear arms from its territory and there have been calls 
there for a motion similar to the one in denmark 
denmark bans the basing of allied troops on its soil in 
peacetime relying on the united states and britain to reinforce 
its territory in times of crisis 
shultz said nato membership yields benefits but it also 
entails responsibilities the two things go together and it is up 
to all of us to measure up as best as we can to our 
responsibilities

acid rains sewage from the sky is an 
important and unrecognized contributor to the death of marine life 
in east coast estuaries and coastal waters an environmental group 
said monday 
nitrate compounds originating in the atmosphere mostly as 
nitric acid appear to contribute about 25 percent of total 
nitrogen flowing into chesapeake bay said the environmental 
defense fund in a report by staff scientists 
ammonium compounds from the atmosphere mostly originating in 
the evaporation of manure contribute another 14 percent of the 
bays nitrogen load the report said 
the damage comes not from the acidity which is immediately 
neutralized by salt water but from the overload of nutrients 
provided by nitrates and ammonium these fertilizers encourage 
blooms of algae that use up oxygen dissolved in the water 
making it difficult for other plants and fish to live and cut off 
light necessary for bottomanchored plants to grow 
by contrast the fund estimated the nitrogen contribution from 
fertilizer runoff at 34 percent municipal and industrial 
discharges at 23 percent and direct runoff from animal waste at 4 
percent 
michael oppenheimer an atmospheric scientist on the fund staff 
and one of the studys authors said this should change forever 
our view of the acid rain problem showing that sewage from the 
sky in the form of nitrogen compounds are a major pollutant of 
inshore waters 
although the funds scientists concentrated on chesapeake bay 
they said there was evidence these airborne compounds also are 
contributing to problems in delaware bay albemarlepamlico sound 
in north carolina long island sound between new york and 
connecticut and the new york bight in the atlantic ocean off new 
york and new jersey 
nationwide a little more than 21 million tons of nitrogen 
oxides are emitted from all sources about one third from motor 
vehicle exhausts one third from power plant smokestacks and one 
seventh from industrial boilers 
the fund said it had provided the first estimate of how much of 
the nitrogen flowing into the bay originates in the atmosphere 
both as runoff into streams and as direct precipitation on the 
bays surface 
the funds estimate of 154000 tons of nitrogen compounds 
flowing into the bay from all sources was higher than the 110000 
estimated by the federalstate chesapeake bay pollution control 
program for an average year but within the range of that programs 
estimates of 92000 tons for a dry year to 198000 tons for a wet 
year 
the joint program has set a goal of reducing nitrogen loading on 
the bay by 40 percent and the funds report said a 40 percent 
reduction should be aimed for in airborne nitrogen 
oppenheimer called for enactment of one of the acid rain control 
bills pending before congress saying with the exception of new 
auto controls the states on the atlantic seaboard can begin this 
program on their own but they cannot finish it a strong 
federal role is absolutely necessary 
bob beck environment manager of the edison electric institute 
the major trade association of private utilities said nitrogen 
oxides from his industry were declining 
chris rice spokesman for the environmental protection agency 
said epa had not had a chance to study the funds report and thus 
could not comment immediately 
the report kicks off three days of rallies press conferences 
and other events by environmental groups seeking an acid rain 
control program that the reagan administration opposes on the 
grounds that not enough is known to justify it the activity is 
timed to coincide with the visit of canadian prime minister brian 
mulroney who also is seeking a us program because half the acid 
rain falling in canada originates in the united states

two alleged african national 
congress guerrillas were convicted of murder monday in connection 
with land mine explosions that killed seven people in 1985 
one of the defendants mzondileli nondula was found guilty of 
planting a mine that killed two white woman and four white children 
as they drove in a pickup truck near the zimbabwe border in 
december 1985 
his codefendant mthetheleli mncube was convicted of laying a 
mine that killed a black farm worker in the same area in november 
1985 mncube also was convicted of murdering two white policemen 
while trying to escape following his arrest in 1986 
both defendants pleaded innocent defense lawyers are scheduled 
to present arguments tuesday in an effort to avoid death sentences 
for the pair 
evidence presented during a sixmonth trial in the northern town 
of messina indicated that both men received military training at 
anc facilities in angola tanzania and zambia 
the anc outlawed in south africa has waged a bombing and 
sabotage campaign since 1961 aimed at ending whiteminority rule 
mncube described himself during the trial as an anc soldier 
but both he and nondula said they were tortured by police before 
signing confessions in a separate development monday the 
staterun south african broadcasting corp reported that a black 
policeman was shot dead by an unknown assailant near newcastle in 
northern natal province 
the broadcasting company said investigators found cartridges at 
the scene from a sovietmade ak47 automatic rifle a weapon which 
authorities say is used by anc guerrillas

consider them collaborators with the whiteled government

a contra leader threatened monday to end the 
upcoming peace talks unless the sandinistas immediately allow us 
humanitarian aid to reach the guerrillas and a top nicaraguan 
official met secretly here with the rebels 
contra director adolfo calero said the truce arrangement reached 
last month in sapoa nicaragua would be in danger if the 
sandinistas continue to block food and medical supplies to rebel 
troops inside that central american country 
calero also acknowledged monday the contents of an april 10 
internal contra memo obtained by the associated press 
his forces position was difficult calero said adding that 
immediate delivery of food and humanitarian supplies must be the 
first priority in the talks scheduled to begin thursday in managua 
the internal memo writen by the contra field officer known as 
cmdr johnson said we urgently need that humanitariantype aid be 
permitted to the troops who are in a critical situation 
we must reach an agreement on that said calero if that 
is not done the whole sapoa agreement will collapse 
he said the contras have three private us companies available 
to rush the supplies to nicaragua as soon as the sandinistas agree 
some of the aid approved by congress was already on its way to 
refugee camps on the hondurannicaraugan border he added 
and in preparation for thursdays toplevel negotiations in 
nicaragua sandinista deputy foreign minister victor tinoco arrived 
secretly in miami to discuss the agenda and arrangments for the 
talks calero confirmed 
tinoco was to meet at an undisclosed location monday with the 
contra directors secretary said calero but was not expected to 
meet facetoface with the five directors 
tinoco has previously accused the contras of engaging in 
political maneuvering to avoid a definitive ceasefire while they 
receive us aid 
we have serious doubts they want to enter into a definitive 
ceasefire tinoco said in nicaragua on april 13 they simply 
want to move into zones which means gains for them without a 
threat with security and to gain the release of 50 percent of the 
prisoners american aid and participation in politics 
the plight of the troops has been said to be a contributing 
cause to a reported rift among the contra leaders but monday 
calero downplayed the differences among the five directors 
he denied leading a movement to fire top military chief enrique 
bermudez but acknowledged two other rebel field comanders tono 
and fernando walter calderon and diogenes hernandez had 
objected to the peace talks he also said when asked about a 
contra shakeup that three top civilian employees of the rebel 
troops had been replaced by military officials 
he insisted however that there was still unity among the 
directors of the nicaraguan resistance as the contras are formally 
called 
all five directors including aristides sanchez who skipped the 
last meeting with the sandinistas in managua for personal 
reasons will fly to nicaragua for this weeks negotiations 
calero said 
he denied infighting between himself and sanchez who some 
sources say has the backing of bermudez and many field commanders 
but acknowledged that tactical differences existed among the contra 
leaders just as they did among the sandinistas

the european economic community has to get 
serious about seeking solutions to an increasingly chaotic 
condition in global agricultural trade or risk being blamed by 
other trading countries agriculture secretary richard e lyng said 
monday 
but the eec is unwilling to even define a longterm goal in 
the reform of the rules of international trade lyng said they 
term our proposal to eventually eliminate tradedistorting 
subsidies as unrealistic or too far too fast yet they have 
not stated what alternative they will accept 
lyng warned that failure to make progress in the negotiations by 
the time of the gatt midterm review in montreal next december 
will bring into question the change for eventual success of the 
socalled uruguay round 
im not pessimistic but ill have to admit theres not whole 
lot to be optimistic about at this point lyng said 
he added i think the european community unless they show 
some willingness to even discuss with us their longterm 
objectives are going to wake up having the problem of failure of 
these talks tossed in their laps i think that will be unpopular 
throughout the world i know it will be and i suspect they might 
begin to come around a little bit 
it has been almost a year and a half since the new uruguay round 
of multinational trade talks began under the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade or gatt yet lyng said the major agricultural 
shippers are expanding export subsidies rather than reducing them 
lyng said the eec for example has just paid a subsidy equal to 
126 per metric ton to wheat exporters and continues to pay huge 
subsidies on a host of other commodities including mixed feed 
291 per ton durum wheat 281 per ton and barley 130 per ton 
the united states he told a meeting of the newspaper farm 
editors of america is calling for agricultural trade reform at the 
uruguay round ultimately under the us proposal international 
trade barriers and subidies would be eliminated over a period of 10 
years or so 
lyng said the excessive influence of governments in farm 
product markets leads to a grossly inefficient allocation of 
resources in developed countries and leave poorer developing 
countries in economic shambles 
the worst offenders are the big nations who are unwilling or 
reluctant to change he said japan with huge trade surpluses 
from exports of industrial and consumer goods clings to import 
barriers on products such as beef rice and citrus 
other exporting countries including the 12nation eec say they 
are not alone in subsidizing agricultural trade and point to the 
export enhancement program operated by the us department of 
agriculture 
under eep as it is known private exporters are given surplus 
usdaowned commodities so they can sell grain or other products to 
selected foreign countries including the soviet union china and 
others department officials claim eep was necessary to compete 
with europes subsidized exports

jesse jackson plans to pour as much as 3 
million into california and spend the better part of a month 
campaigning there in an allout effort to win in the nations most 
populous state his campaign chairman said monday 
california will be a major player in the presidential 
sweepstakes said california assembly speaker willie brown who 
heads up jacksons national presidential campaign 
noting that it is virtually impossible for either democratic 
frontrunner michael dukakis or jackson to get the necessary 2081 
delegates to win the nomination before californias june 7 primary 
brown said no matter what happens between now and then we are a 
player 
with his eye on the states 314 delegates jackson will campaign 
in calfornia from may 5 through may 28 making only about two 
forays to other states during that time brown told reporters 
during a visit to the capital 
for the first time in the campaign jackson may be able to 
compete financially because his fund raising has picked up 
tremendously brown said 
in every place jackson has been a candidate he has been 
outspent three or four or five to one california is a 
mediaoriented market the way our money is coming in for us now 
its clear we are going to be better than competitive in 
california he said 
dukakis has led the democratic field in fund raising and 
spending since the beginning of the primary season but during 
march he was not far ahead of jackson raising 24 million to 
jacksons 2 million 
jackson is counting on winning votes from groups that have 
supported him in other states including peace activists 
environmentalists and gay voters as well as his strong black 
constituency brown said 
the battle for the states sizable hispanic population is 
expected to be intense with jackson bringing in former new mexico 
gov toney anaya and former state health director mario obledo to 
campaign for him dukakis speaks fluent spanish and has done well 
among hispanics in other states 
brown said that if jackson does well among his constituent 
groups and can double the white vote that he got in 1984 he is 
in a position to spring a surprise in california 
jacksons campaign also hopes to get dukakis to participate in 
joint appearances and debates but so far only one debate is 
scheduled in california brown said 
california is an issuebased state with such regional concerns 
as offshore drilling timber harvesting and coastal protection 
brown said 
jackson is a lot smarter than you think he said he is 
already hip on those issues 
brown sought to undo recent comments he made about jackson being 
a vice presidential prospect if he does not win the presidential 
nomination 
he said jackson is running for president only he said that in 
answering questions from reporters about the second spot on the 
democratic ticket sometimes were not as judicious in our 
answers as we should be 
he said he knew of no conversations between jackson aides and 
the dukakis camp about the vice presidential issue

democratic presidential candidate jesse 
jackson said monday he could conceive of situations where he would 
grant safe passage to hostagetakers saying i choose negotiation 
over blind bloody confrontation 
jackson rejected what he called material concessions to 
terrorists but did not rule out political accommodation 
if we are going to deter terrorism we must address the 
underlying causes of terrorism he said after an appearance at a 
high school in pittsburgh terrorism does not emerge out of the 
blue 
jackson met later with gov bob casey as he prepared for 
tuesdays pennsylvania primary but the candidate was beseiged with 
questions stemming from a statement he made sunday 
jackson said then he disagreed with rival michael dukakis 
position that we should not negotiate with terrorists jackson 
said i disagree with that if i could get the hostages out id 
do it 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said monday that the 
us government will talk to anyone to any group to any 
government about the wellbeing and release of the americans still 
held hostage in lebanon 
she added we will not make concessions to terrorists or 
compromise our fundamental principles 
but jackson insisted the fact is that our government has 
talked with terrorists and has negotiated in some instances 
successfully it is good as a policy but there must be always 
flexibility in the policy we ought to take every initiative we 
can to gain the freedom of the american hostages in beirut 
jackson said he believed it made sense to talk with terrorists 
because no one else has direct control over the hostages 
the reason that we must keep open to talking with terrorists 
or any enemy is because in the final analysis terrorists our 
enemy are the only ones who have the ability and power to end the 
terror and declare peace we must talk to them or find out what 
their underlying grievances are about 
he noted that as a private citizen he talked with the state 
department before making efforts on behalf of american hostages to 
make sure he was not contradicting us policy 
the first principle is that we should not jeopardize our 
national interests or national security he said 
he said he would not make material concessions to 
terrorists a term he defined that as giving something physical 
jackson said in certain circumstances he might be persuaded to 
grant hostages safe passage and freedom from prosecution in 
exchange for hostages 
we did it to gain the freedom of the hostages in the twa 
airliner and i think it was the right thing to do he said he 
was referring to the 1985 hijacking of a twa jet in lebanon 
he also used the attica prison uprising in 1971 as an example 
jackson said then new york gov nelson rockefeller charged and 
there was nothing left but blood i choose negotiation over blind 
bloody confrontation 
it was jacksons talks with syrian leaders that led to the 
release of captured navy flyer robert goodman in 1984

the supreme court is flexing its conservative 
muscle resurrecting fears among liberals that president reagan may 
have succeeded in pushing the court to the right 
in a move that sparked sharp criticism and dire predictions from 
opponents a 54 court majority said monday it is thinking about 
overturning a 1976 decision considered a key civil rights victory 
the ruling 12 years ago never undone by congress interpreted a 
civil warera law as permitting lawsuits for monetary damages 
against private businesses and individuals over alleged racial 
discrimination 
the decision in runyon vs mccrary adopted in hundreds of lower 
court cases since has become what one civil rights lawyer called 
a major strand of the civil rights enforcement infrastructure 
four justices said mondays announcement could shake minorities 
faith in the court 
time alone will tell whether the erosion of faith is 
unnecessarily precipitous said justice john paul stevens a 
swing vote who most often sides with the courts liberals but in 
the meantime some of the harm that will flow from todays order may 
never be completely undone 
ira glasser executive director of the american civil liberties 
union agreed the message is theres a new court and previous 
rulings are up for grabs he said if this decision possibly 
can be overturned perhaps a lot more are endangered 
the courts three reagan appointees justices sandra day 
oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy joined chief 
justice william h rehnquist and byron r white in voting to 
restudy the 1976 decision 
joining stevens in dissent were justices william j brennan and 
thurgood marshall the courts leading liberals and justice harry 
a blackmun another swing vote 
will there be five votes to overturn the 1976 precedent 
rehnquist long the courts most conservative member and white 
a conservative with a generally liberal voting record in civil 
rights cases dissented from the 1976 decision they are two likely 
votes to overturn 
scalia is considered as conservative as rehnquist and a third 
vote to overturn 
the keys may be the votes of oconnor who in recent years has 
shown greater independence from the courts conservative bloc and 
kennedy whose impact to date has been minimal because he only 
joined the court in february 
kennedy won senate confirmation after reagans nomination of 
robert h bork was rejected 
borks critics in the senate and among civil rights 
organizations said they feared his replacing centrist lewis f 
powell on the court could threaten 30 years of civil rights 
precedents 
in its first seven years the reagan administration has had 
little success persuading the court to adopt the presidents 
conservative agenda outlawing abortion restoring prayers in 
public schools and curtailing affirmative action 
kennedy whose views on such matters are unknown is viewed as a 
staunch conservative but less ideological than bork the concerns 
voiced during the bork nomination fight were echoed monday however 
calling kennedy the key to a new court the aclus glaser 
said bork had an extensive record of civil rights animus and 
kennedy did not but this isnt encouraging

released monday 
the important mission and critical safety role of the nrc 
require that it possess a firstrate investigative capability 
the general accounting office said in the study which was released 
by the nrc 
gao the investigative wing of congress said the study was 
based on the review of three investigations made within the nuclear 
agency gao said that in two cases the work done by the nrcs 
office and inspector and auditor was not thorough enough 
one case involved allegations by an nrc inspector that superiors 
had pressured him to change findings in 1986 about safety 
conditions at the comanche peak steam electric station in texas 
the other involved alleged improper discussions in 1986 between 
victor stello the nrcs executive director of operations and 
steve white head of the tennessee valley authoritys nrcregulated 
nuclear program 
gao said its review supported the findings of nrc investigators 
who said neither matter was improper but in both cases gao said 
nrc investigators had not interviewed individuals with key roles 
the third case looked into nrcs investigation of how a copy of 
an internal nrc document turned up in 1985 in the files of the 
louisiana power and light cos waterford iii plant along with a 
memo from lpls holding company saying the document had been 
received from sources inside the nrc 
gao said notations on the copy indicated it was duplicated from 
the file copy in the office of nrc commissioner thomas roberts who 
was in charge of investigating the alleged leak 
gao was critical of the very limited investigation made by 
roberts but gao said it was unable to determine how the copy 
reached the regulated utility 
a properly conducted investigation might have provided nrc 
with the identity of the leaker according to gao 
the case gao said demonstrated that a regulated utility 
secured unauthorized access to nrc documents the ability to obtain 
such materials could impact on the nrcs enforcement program 
licensing functions and regulatory procedures 
the nrc should assure that its investigators conduct their 
work in a competent manner using professional standards said 
gao adding that there is a lack of coordination between the nrcs 
office of investigations and office of inspector and auditor 
nrc chairman lando zech said in a statement accompanying the gao 
study that he agrees the agency needs a firstrate investigative 
capability 
the commission will give careful consideration to the entire 
report in our continuing efforts to assure that we carry out our 
investigative responsibilities fairly and efficiently zech said

opec and independent oil exporters on 
monday made lastminute preparations for a series of meetings aimed 
at tightening oil supplies and driving prices up further 
officials of the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
and rival oil producers expressed cautious optimism that an 
agreement could be reached this week on joint measures to support 
prices 
any meeting between opec and nonopec nations is important 
but this one is particularly so because prices seem to be weak 
said indonesian delegate subroto a former oil minister 
he said all 13 countries participating in the meetings tuesday 
were eager to do something to prop up prices 
world oil markets appeared to be taking a cautiously optimistic 
stance on the upcoming conferences 
in the european spot or noncontract market the price of 
brent crude from the north sea was up about 10 cents a barrel at 
1725 in late trading compared with last fridays close traders 
said activity was light 
futures prices also edged upward on the new york mercantile 
exchange where contracts for june delivery of west texas 
intermediate the benchmark us crude closed at 1840 per 
barrel up 10 cents from friday 
senior officials from mexico colombia egypt angola oman 
malaysia brunei and china were to meet tuesday and wednesday with 
opecs price monitoring committee comprised of the oil ministers 
of saudi arabia indonesia venezuela nigeria and algeria 
that is to be followed on thursday by a meeting of all 13 opec 
members 
also in vienna though not expected to participate in the joint 
meetings was kent hance a member of the texas railroad 
commission which regulates the states oil production of 2 million 
42gallon barrels a day he has indicated he plans to meet 
individually with ministers to discuss his concern about 
instability in the oil market 
mexicos oil minister fernando hiriart balderrama told 
reporters that mexico was ready to accept a 5 percent cut in its 
oil exports if other producers agreed to do the same he declined 
to be specific about how many or which others must go along 
mexico exports about 14 million barrels a day of its total 
daily output of 29 million 
we know that it might be difficult to reach unanimity at 
this weeks meetings hiriart balderrama said through an 
interpreter but we expect a substantial number of countries to 
do something similar to mexicos proposed cut 
together the eight nonopec countries represented in vienna 
produce about 8 million barrels a day compared with opecs 
estimated output of between 175 million and 18 million barrels 
daily 
industry analysts expressed doubt that this weeks meeting could 
reach a concrete agreement on opec and nonopec production cuts 
but some said it could mark a turning point in opecs long and 
largely unsuccessful campaign to win closer cooperation with rival 
producers 
the worlds two biggest oil producers the soviet union and the 
united states were not invited to the vienna meeting

and cut off her forearms with an ax a decade ago was freed from 
parole monday and headed for an undisclosed location his case 
continuing to arouse public outrage 
he was a free man according to law at 1201 am today and 
he just simply walked off parole from the place he was located 
said bob gore spokesman for the california department of 
corrections 
we have no legal right to follow him any further and no 
statutory means of requiring him to go somewhere he said 
bob plath a member of an inmate support group said he knew 
where singleton planned to go but could not reveal the location for 
fear someone might hurt singleton 
singleton 60 was convicted of abducting a teenage hitchhiker 
raping her and then hacking off her forearms near modesto 45 miles 
east of san francisco in 1978 he served eight years of a 14year 
sentence 
he was under no obligation to tell officials where he planned to 
go when his year of parole expired and gave only noncommital 
answers when asked gore said 
i think he is very dangerous and unstable i think hes 
operating under a delusion of innocence said donald stahl 
stanislaus county district attorney i dont know what will 
happen when the pressure gets to be too much or if he falls off the 
wagon 
singleton who was drinking heavily the day of the attack has 
not had alcohol during his imprisonment or parole officials said 
singletons victim mary vincent is living at an undisclosed 
location and still fears singleton her lawyer said she wants to 
remain undisturbed and in seclusion 
singleton has friends and supporters who do not accept his 
claims of innocence but believe he will not be dangerous if he is 
lef alone and can stay with people who care about him 
while we cant forget cant we forgive said plath a marin 
county lawyer 
angry protests followed singleton from town to town last year 
when officials tried to place him in several san francisco bay area 
communities on parole singleton was finally put in a small trailer 
on the grounds of san quentin prison to complete his parole but a 
few days ago he was moved to an undisclosed location 
the protests now have shifted north to azalea ore where 
singleton reportedly will join the bride of christ church after 
visiting family in florida frightened residents have denounced the 
plan and earlier this month someone fired a shotgun at church 
buildings and vehicles

a top state department official said monday he 
will meet with representatives of japan south korea china and 
poland about a possible voluntary agreement to ban fishing in an 
area of the bering sea that scientists fear is being overfished 
edward wolfe ambassador of oceans and fisheries said he will 
brief the four nations in the next few days on ussoviet fishing 
talks last week that included discussion of a moratorium on fishing 
in the bering seas socalled doughnut hole 
while no agreement was reached between the united states and the 
soviet union over the future of fishing in the doughnut hole 
another round of meetings is expected in moscow later this spring 
wolfe earlier had said the ussoviet negotiations were 
exploratory and involved a good exchange of views 
both countries are concerned that overfishing in the doughnut 
hole by foreign trawlers including those from japan south 
korea china and poland could cause a decline in the catch in the 
us and soviet fishing zones that surround the area 
the 4500square mile doughnut hole is considered one of the 
richest fishing grounds in the world and the catch in the area has 
grown from about 200000 metric tons to more than 1 million metric 
tons over the past four years 
both the soviets and the us would prefer a voluntary ban on 
fishing in the doughnut hole the moratorium could be temporary 
or permanent as scientists study the fish stocks in the bering sea

george bush campaigning on the eve of the 
primary that should put him over the top promised monday to keep 
showing the flag no matter how firm his grip on the republican 
presidential nomination 
i still want to continue to campaign through the primary 
season bush told the greater pittsburgh chamber of commerce 
bush spent the day traveling and speaking in the state where he 
is expected to top the 1139 delegates needed for the gop 
nomination in tuesdays primary 
most of his remarks were routine but he answered back after 
being met at the scrantonwilkes barre airport by a dozen or so 
hecklers some of them bearing signs urging the united states to 
end its aid to the contras in nicaragua 
im glad to see the jesse jackson supporters here or maybe 
the mike dukakis supporters he said i will welcome them in 
debate i will welcome taking on their ticket and we will beat them 
in the fall 
he has been virtually unopposed for the republican nomination 
since the withdrawal last month of sen bob dole his only 
remaining opponent pat robertson has ceased active campaigning 
bush who has said he expects to face democrat michael dukakis 
in the fall election struck at democrats who he said talk about 
despair and agony 
youre going to see a clear choice in the general election 
he said 
he called pittsburgh tough and resilient and compared its 
revival to his own 
you took it on the chin economically in the 1970s and early 
1980s bush said 
i know what its like to be knocked to the canvas he said 
noting his defeat in the iowa caucuses 
but bush said he picked himself up and started anew calling 
that a parallel to what you demonstrated here 
despite his apparently insurmountable lead he said im still 
showing the flag in pennsylvania 
at campaign stops through the day bush 
said he intends to take part in generalelection debates with 
the democratic nominee but he would not be pinned down on dates or 
format 
there will be debates im looking forward to them he said 
but he also said in an interview with local reporters im not 
going to let some outside group even within my own party set the 
agenda 
said he is in full accord with president reagans promise to 
veto trade legislation nearing final congressional approval but 
also said he hoped some other way could be found to notify workers 
of impending plant closings 
the bill contains a provision requiring 60 days notice when 
plants are to be shut down i know its an emotional issue but it 
interferes with our ability to compete 
told a republican veterans rally he would try to maintain the 
defense buildup begun by reagan ill never be afraid to reach 
out for peace but ill do it with my eyes open he said

jews seeking to emigrate are receiving revised 
invitations from israel that promise to provide them with visas in 
romania activists said monday 
the activists said the change is apparently part of an effort to 
boost emigration to the jewish state but it could make it 
difficult for jews to settle anywhere else they said 
invitations from family members and the israeli government are 
the official basis on which jews are allowed to leave visas now 
come through the dutch embassy which has handled israels 
interests since the kremlin broke relations after the 1967 middle 
east war 
sergei mkrtchyan said monday he knew of about a half a dozen 
people who did not emigrate because the soviet visa office said 
they could go only to israel with the new invitations 
they rejected it because they wanted to go to america he 
said in a telephone interview 
according to the new invitations israeli visas will be issued 
in bucharest capital of romania the only soviet bloc nation that 
has formal relations with israel 
michael stolar an american citizen who remains in moscow 
because his soviet wife is refused permission to leave said jews 
who want to go somewhere other than israel are worried 
a lot of people are talking about the problem whether it 
will increase or decrease emigration whether the soviets will let 
more people out or whether fewer people will apply he said 
both he and mkrtchyan want to go to israel and are active in a 
group called poor relatives for people who are denied 
permission to leave because a family member will not waive 
financial obligations imposed by law 
they said the new invitations began arriving about three weeks 
ago and the longterm effect is unclear 
in the past many soviet jews left the country through vienna 
and traveled from there to western europe the united states or 
israel 
mkrtchyan said it could be difficult for jews to go anywhere 
except israel from bucharest because of limited connections and 
because a jew arriving in israel automatically becomes an israeli 
citizen limiting his ability to settle elsewhere 
jews who emigrate from the soviet union lose their soviet 
citizenship 
israel wants soviet jews to settle there and has promoted a 
direct air link via romania among those emigrating through 
bucharest was josef begun a prominent soviet jew who emigrated in 
january 
according to the union of councils for soviet jews only 221 of 
the 986 who emigrated in march went to israel and 42 traveled 
through bucharest 
the 986 represented the highest total in 15 months more than 
8000 jews were allowed to emigrate in all of 1987 many more than 
in any of the previous several years but still far below the peak 
of 51000 in 1979 more than 2400 jews emigrated in the first 
three months of 1988 
sources said israel instructed the dutch embassy to continue 
issuing visas with which jews can emigrate through vienna or any 
other transit city but activists said that may not matter if 
soviet authorities insist on emigrants going by way of romania 
requiring jews to leave through bucharest may increase the 
number going to israel by 5 to 10 percent but the rest want to 
settle elsewhere mkrtchyan said

holocaust survivors hugged each other and 
shouted bravo bravo when an israel judge on monday sentenced 
retired ohio autoworker john demjanjuk to death for nazi war crimes 
other israelis however said they were uncomfortable with the 
imposition of the death penalty 
in the cleveland area where the ukrainianborn demjanjuk lived 
for more than 30 years before his 1986 extradition to israel the 
sentence increased the grief and anger of the local ukrainian 
community ukrainianamericans there prayed and raised money for 
the man they believe to be innocent 
when judge zvi tal whose parents were killed in the holocaust 
announced the sentence dozens of courtroom spectators jumped to 
their feet shouting bravo bravo and death death and 
singing the people of israel live 
but ephraim zuroff head of the israeli branch of the simon 
wiesenthal center told israel radio that while he understood the 
emotional outburst it was totally uncalled for and just lends 
credence to defense claims that someone like demjanjuk cant 
get a fair trial in israel 
the center collects and provides to authorities information on 
suspected nazi war criminals 
some survivors wept with emotion as the sentence was announced 
the only justice will be to give him to the survivors and let 
them finish him off piece by piece said frances jason of los 
angeles who survived the auschwitz death camp in nazioccupied 
poland 
a thousand death penalties cannot compensate for what 
happened but at least we have passed judgment on one of the angels 
of death said yosef czarny a survivor of treblinka death camp 
where 850000 jews were killed in 194243 
the court last week convicted demjanjuk 68 of being ivan the 
terrible a sadistic guard at treblinka who operated gas chambers 
and tortured inmates before sending them to their deaths 
about 6 million jews were killed in the holocaust a stated goal 
of israel which was founded after the nazi slayings is to bring 
adolf hitlers henchmen to justice 
us industrialist armand hammer who aided israel in obtaining 
evidence that helped lead to demjanjuks conviction told a news 
conference in beijing monday before the sentence was announced 
theres no question in my mind that demjanjuk is guilty 
hammer chairman of los angelesbased occidental petroleum was 
in china to sign a new joint venture agreement he helped israel 
obtain a nazi identification card that purportedly was issued to 
demjanjuk as a camp guard 
demjanjuks soninlaw ed nishnic of cleveland told a news 
conference in toronto that demjanjuk was sentenced to death because 
jews are haunted by memories of the holocaust and desperate to 
punish those guilty of war crimes 
but we believe there is doubt demjanjuk is ivan the 
terrible said nishnic hes been falsely convicted the real 
ivan the terrible does not have our sympathy or our support he 
should be sentenced to death 
foreign minister shimon peres told israel army radio if he 
demjanjuk was a nazi who killed thousands of people i have 
no problems with the severity of the punishment 
but chaim dasberg a psychiatrist and holocaust survivor said 
many israelis feel uncomfortable with the death penalty even if 
they believe it is the correct punishment for nazi war criminals 
dasberg said he himself opposed the death penalty for several 
reasons among them humanitarian ones 
but this goes beyond that there are criminals and there are 
criminals he said 
the rev john bruchok of st marys ukrainian orthodox church in 
lorain ohio said monday its a travesty of justice 
bruchok met demjanjuk and his family shortly before demjanjuk 
was sent to israel to stand trial 
the priest said i saw his face i saw the face of a gentle 
man who was scared an innocent man is being executed 
the rev john nakonachny a priest at st vladimirs ukrainian 
orthodox church in parma the demjanjuk family parish said it 
has been the unanimous opinion of this parish that demjanjuk is 
innocent that has been the opinion since the beginning 
demjanjuk a retired ohio autoworker lived in the cleveland 
suburb of seven hills 
after he was convicted jewish organizations in akron about 40 
miles south of cleveland asked for police protection because 
callers were threatening local jews 
mary dackiewicz who operates the john demjanjuk defense fund 
said that after the sentencing monday she had received many 
telephone calls 
the phone calls are from people who have been totally outraged 
at what happened over there she said 
edgar bronfman of montreal world jewish congress president 
said he is not a believer in capital punishment but for 
holocaust criminals such as demjanjuk i would be hard pressed not 
to impose the death sentence

iran called monday for the nations youth 
to prepare to go quickly to the battlefront iraq announced it has 
successfully tested a new missile capable of reaching deep into 
iranian territory 
president ali khamenei of iran speaking on tehran radio said 
young iranians should get ready to to be sent to the fronts and 
to fight against the enemies of the islamic revolution in a most 
extensive way 
the young people especially those who have received training 
and who are ready should move forward their allotted time for 
dispatch and go earlier others too should continue their dispatch 
in an accelerated form he said 
tehran radio said khamenei spoke after a meeting of the supreme 
war effort council the broadcast was monitored in cyprus 
iran suffered a battlefield setback 10 days ago when iraqi 
forces recaptured the faw peninsula in southern iraq it had been 
seized by iranian troops in february 1986 
the two countries have been at war since september 1980 
iraqs official news agency also monitored in cyprus said a 
powerful new surfacetosurface missile has been tested 
successfully 
the announcement could serve as a warning to iran not to respond 
to the loss of faw by resuming the deadly missile duel known as the 
war of the cities the last such battle lasted from feb 29 to 
last thursday with the capitals of baghdad and tehran being 
frequent targets 
brig hussein kamel hassan director of iraqs military 
industries informed president saddam hussein that the new missile 
named alabass has a range of 550 miles according to the news 
agency 
iraq has used alhussein missiles since last august in the duel 
with iran 
it claimed the alhussein missiles were domestically produced 
but western military analysts believe they are sovietdesigned ss1 
scudb weapons with special rocket boosters to give them a range of 
up to 400 miles 
the agency report gave no details of the new missile 
western analysts said they thought iraq may have obtained a 
larger missile that also could be equipped with boosters 
there was a lull in action along the 730mile front both sides 
reported scattered skirmishes and artillery duels

an irancontra prosecutor withdrew from the 
case partly because he felt he had been impermissibly exposed to 
the defendants congressional testimony independent counsel 
lawrence e walsh testified monday 
during a lengthy grilling by a lawyer for marine lt col oliver 
l north walsh revealed that associate independent counsel 
christopher todd had withdrawn from participation in the case 
walsh said todd withdrew partly because he believed he might be 
tainted by congressional testimony given by three of the four 
defendants under grants of limited immunity from prosecution 
i dont know whether he was tainted or not walsh told 
defense attorney brendan v sullivan jr all i know about mr 
todd he chose to follow a certain course 
todd who remains on the independent counsels staff doing 
unrelated work didnt explain the possible exposure because he 
didnt want to taint me walsh said 
walsh did not say when todd withdrew but he was seen last month 
in us district court when former national security adviser robert 
mcfarlane pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of withholding 
information from congress about covert reagan administration aid to 
the contras 
the defense contends that forcing north former national 
security adviser john m poindexter and businessman albert hakim to 
go to trial on conspiracy charges would violate their fifth 
amendment right against selfincrimination because they were forced 
to testify to congress last summer 
arguing there was enormous taint of walshs staff as a 
result of unprecedented publicity of the three defendants 
immunized testimony sullivan said this case cant proceed if i 
have any understanding of the fifth amendment 
no date has been set for the trial of the three men who along 
with retired air force maj gen richard v secord are accused of 
conspiring to illegally divert usiran armssale profits to the 
nicaraguan rebels secord testified on capitol hill without an 
immunity grant 
at the outset of mondays hearing us district judge gerhard 
a gesell barred any defense testimony on the ground that lawyers 
for the defendants had disobeyed his order that they give walsh 
timely notice of the witness they intended to produce 
the orders of the court are going to be complied with 
gesell told the defendants 
we are going to proceed whether the atmosphere is one of 
confrontation and namecalling or not the judge told the 
defendants and their lawyers who had accused the judge in court 
papers of establishing a procedure that makes a mockery of 
their clients rights 
late in the day the defense filed a notice that it intended to 
appeal gesells april 13 order to the us circuit court of appeals 
here 
i have a great sense of unfairness for my client when you 
rebuke defense counsel sullivan who denied he had violated the 
order told the judge after the midday recess 
i dont believe you abided either with the letter or the 
spirit of the court order gesell replied 
during more than four hours of testimony walsh described 
elaborate procedures he used to prevent investigators prosecutors 
and grand jurors from exposure to the testimony that north 
poindexter hakim and other immunized witnesses gave congress 
despite those procedures walsh said he was exposed to 
information about immunized testimony on six occasions three 
before the four defendants were indicted on march 16 
i was never exposed to the testimony itself so far as i 
know walsh said the information he received was in the form of 
summaries 
members of the staff were instructed to file reports of similar 
episodes with john douglass a parttime independent counsel who 
was designated to determine if such incidents of exposure would 
require a prosecutor to leave the staff 
but walsh conceded under sullivans crossexamination that he 
never looked at any of the reports douglass received to determine 
how well his procedures were working 
if douglass had too many breaches i would know about that 
walsh said 
although his orders sometimes called for subjective judgments a 
prosecutor would know he was jeopardizing the investigation if 
hes careless walsh said 
walsh turned over douglass file to the court so that defense 
lawyers could examine the reports and question the independent 
counsel about them when the hearing resumes on wednesday 
herbert j stern a former federal judge and veteran prosecutor 
representing walsh on the immunity issue said he can show that 
every bit of the evidence was independently derived 
the extensive procedures of insulation are just extras and are 
really not needed stern said 
gesell said that exposure of a grand jury witness to immunized 
testimony wouldnt necessarily scuttle the case it might only mean 
that the particular witness couldnt testify in the trial 
going ahead with the case and immunity are not necessarily 
irreconcilable he said

section of wildliferich marshland to an oil spill saying the 
tactic would save hundreds more acres of wetlands 
were trying to keep new areas from becoming oiled said 
brian hunter of the state department of fish and game were 
willing to try and capture as much oil as we can in 20 acres of 
marsh

northeast of san francisco 
by monday morning a slick stretched for 10 miles in suisun bay 
and carquinez strait but was beginning to dissipate in tidal 
currents the biggest concentration was confined to an area of 
marshland and coated at least 100 birds 
coast guard spotter planes six vessels with oil skimmers and 16 
vacuum tanktrucks raced to capture oil and save wetland animals 
floating oil booms were laid in the water to keep oil away from 
wildlife areas 
coast guard spokesman ken massey estimated it could take until 
next week to clean up the spill 
shell acknowledged responsibility for the spill and massey said 
the company would have to pay for the costs of the cleanup and 
damages which would include new paint for the bottoms of thousands 
of pleasure boats in area marinas 
there was no immediate estimate of the damage 
shell spokesman bill sharkey said the spill was the companys 
worst in 73 years the last at the 850acre refinery occurred in 
june 1986 when a tank overflowed 8000 gallons of oil 
by monday about 100 birds including egrets avocets cinnamon 
teals mallard ducks grebes herons and the endangered clapper 
rail bird had been rescued and taken to centers in berkeley and 
walnut creek for cleaning hunter said the spill also threatened 
many nests

four of the navys main nonnuclear missiles 
still are having quality problems that have delayed delivery or 
produced some substandard weapons the general accounting office 
said monday 
all of the missile systems we examined had defects that is 
they failed in one respect or another to conform with contract 
specifications said the congressional watchdog agency 
the gao reviewed the phoenix highspeed antiradiation harm 
harpoon and sparrow missiles four weapons deployed on a variety 
of navy ships for use against other ships and planes 
the review done for the house energy and commerce 
investigations subcommittee found 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
design and workmanship problems on safety and arming devices 
aboard the phoenix aim54c problems which the gao said have 
delayed deliveries of more than 500 phoenix missiles the weapon is 
built by hughes aircraft of tucson ariz 
pressure transducers for some harms may not have been tested 
before being put into the missiles the transducer is used in 
activating the weapons targetseeking device the chief contractor 
is texas instruments 
altimeters for the harpoon were being accepted under a contract 
deviation permitting a solderingrelated condition which the gao 
said could affect the weapons reliability the main contractor is 
mcdonnelldouglas 
detonators on some sparrows were unknowingly built without 
enough explosive compound to set off the warhead the chief 
contractor is raytheon 
most of the problems occurred at the level of subcontractors 
the gao said 
one common problem was that changes were made in manufacturing 
processes which were unknown to the prime contractor but affected 
the quality of the product the gao told congress 
many of the problems related to soldering but it is unclear how 
serious the problems are the gao said 
some contractors and government officials believe that certain 
requirements in the navys soldering specification are more 
stringent than necessary to have a reliable missile the report 
said 
they cite high reliability rates and the successful use of 
missiles that deviate from the soldering specifications as evidence 
that the navys soldering specifications may be too stringent it 
said 
the pentagon in a response that was part of the review said it 
partially agrees with the gao 
jack katzen deputy assistant secretary of defense for systems 
said the pentagon acknowledges that a number of problems have 
been experienced during the production of navy missiles 
but katzen added contrary to the gao implication in no case 
has the navy knowingly accepted missiles suspected of containing 
defects that could affect the performance of the missile in any 
case where the defects were determined to affect performance the 
contractor was required to take the necessary corrective actions 
in addition the gao noted pilots ordnance officers and other 
navy officials aboard ships were satisfied with the missiles 
performance and capabilities and cited no particular problems

us and soviet publishers agreed monday to 
breathe some glasnost into the hightech field by jointly 
publishing the first russianlanguage magazine devoted to personal 
computers 
international data group inc said the venture with radio i 
sviaz publishers was the first joint publishing effort in the 
soviet union 
the soviet government is definitely interested in getting the 
use of pcs widespread idg president alex leblois said when 
you think that a few years ago getting permission to use a 
typewriter or a copying machine was very difficult the change is 
very great 
idg publishes pc world the second largest us publication on 
personal computers with a monthly circulation of about 475000 
the first issue of pc world ussr is scheduled to hit soviet 
newsstands at the end of june a staff of seven soviet writers and 
editors will produce about onethird of the magazines copy with 
the rest translated from european and the us sources 
the magazine will cost 2 rubles or about 320 at the official 
exchange rate leblois said 
eugene n salnicov director of radio i sviaz said some foreign 
language computer journals are available in moscow libraries but 
that soviet pc users have no information about developments within 
the country 
personal computers are in their infancy in the soviet union 
with under 100000 westernmade machines used only by a few 
universities government officers scientists and engineers 
salnicov said but the country has a potential market of 30 million 
users he added 
we feel that from what our experts think the pc enables you to 
increase your labor productivity by several hundred percent so 
theres every reason to have them salnicov said 
about 50000 copies of the magazines first issue will be 
available in bookstores and on newsstands which we know will not 
come near to satisfying the demand salnicov said 
leblois said issues will average 150 pages or more of which 
about 20 percent will be advertising four issues a year are 
initially planned 
in keeping with soviet guidelines on joint ventures adopted in 
january 1987 the soviet partner will own 51 percent of the project 
and idg will own 49 percent 
leblois said idg has invested 250000 into the project but 
expects to recoup that almost immediately through advertising from 
western computer makers seeking a foothold in the soviet union 
the magazine already has sold ads for its first issue to 
companies including microsoft atari ashtontate bull and 
siemens he said the first issue should carry 120000 of ads 
leblois said 
the soviets did not detail their investment but in addition to 
the seven writers the magazine will be printed in the soviet union 
as long as they can hold their investment down theres not 
much to lose marshall goldman associate director of the russian 
research center at harvard university said of idgs participation 
the question is how long advertisers will be interested if 
theyre selling to a soviet audience which cant buy what theyre 
selling 
but leblois noted that 16bit personal computers which include 
the ibm pc and other compatible machines can be exported to the 
soviet union under relaxed guidelines agreed by western countries 
in january he predicted that american western european and 
japanese computer makers will rush to secure jointproduction 
agreements 
pc world ussrs sales will cover all production costs and 
advertising revenues will be paid in western currencies that will 
make it easier for idg to repatriate earnings from the project 
something which has been a problem for other joint ventures 
generating earnings in rubles 
idg hich publishes local language editions of pc world in 14 
nations it has published china computerworld a monthly since 
1980 and began a computer magazine in hungary two years ago its 
only other publication in the east bloc

the government will hire foreign experts to train 
a special 100member antiterrorism force to combat hijackers like 
those who commandeered a kuwait airways jumbo jetliner this month 
security officials said monday 
kuwaits crown prince and prime minister sheik saad alabdullah 
alsabah meanwhile called on sister and friendly states to 
arrest try and punish the hijackers and asked for interarab 
cooperation to fight terrorism 
he said he did not know if the hijackers were still in algeria 
where the ordeal ended on its 16th day last wednesday 
kuwaits move came amid growing fears in arab states that the 
7yearwar between iran and iraq will increase terrorism by 
proiranian shiite moslem groups saudi arabia intends to form its 
own antiterrorist squad it was reported last month 
the saudis are to receive help from gen ulrich wegener 
commander of west germanys crack antiterrorist force he headed 
the commandos that stormed a hijacked lufthansa jetliner in 
mogadishu somalia in 1977 considered a classic antihijacking 
operation 
many west european countries including britain france italy 
and west germany have elite units which have acted against 
terrorists over the last 20 years 
the new kuwaiti force will be directed by the interior ministry 
after a sixmonth training program by foreign experts in kuwait and 
abroad said the security officials speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
they gave no details and did not identify the foreign 
specialists 
proiranian shiite moslems hijacked the kuwaiti boeing 747 with 
112 people aboard april 5 as it was flying from bangkok thailand 
to kuwait the hijackers killed two kuwaiti passengers before the 
ordeal ended in algiers on wednesday 
the hijackers demanded that kuwait release 17 terrorists 
convicted for bombing the us and french embassies in kuwait in 
1983 kuwaiti officials said they would not release them 
the hijacking ended when the gunmen slipped off the jet 
apparently after receiving a promise of safe passage to an 
undisclosed country the passengers left the plane shortly 
afterward 
rashed abdelaziz rashed minister of state for cabinet affairs 
told saudi arabias alsharq alawsat newspaper that kuwait had not 
been told of the hijackers whereabouts 
however the rightwing daily newspaper alseyassa and the 
radical alrai alaam daily reported monday that kuwaiti security 
authorities aided by unidentified foreign intelligence agencies 
have identified the hijackers it did not elaborate 
rashed told alseyassa that certain powers and parties hostile 
to the arabs were behind the hijacking it was an apparent 
reference to iran and the proiranian lebanonbased hezbollah or 
party of god 
iran is persian not arab although it shares the moslem 
religion with the arabs it adheres to the minority shiite sect 
that has been at odds with the predominant sunni branch of islam 
for 1300 years 
the shiite fundamentalist hezbollah is believed to be the 
umbrella group for shiite factions holding most of the 21 foreign 
hostages in lebanon 
the longest held is terry anderson 40 chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
the kuwaiti cabinet set up a committee to investigate the 
hijacking rashed announced sunday saying murdering the two 
kuwaiti passengers is a crime that will not go unpunished 
prime minister saad told editors of local and weekly newspapers 
in a televised news conference monday that tiny oilrich kuwait 
alone cannot put an end to or contain the activity of terrorists 
i hereby issue a frank and sincere call to our arab brethren to 
cooperate to fight terrorism and terrorists wherever they exist 
the apprehension trial and punishment of the kuwait airways 
hijackers should take place through constructive dialogue between 
us and sister and friendly states saad said 
he also said that when the jet landed at mashhad airport in iran 
early in its odyssey iranian officials pressed the kuwaiti team 
which flew to mashhad to accept all or part of the hijackers 
demands but the kuwaiti reply was a clear and frank rejection

the security council on monday condemned 
the assassination of the plos military commander and the united 
states abstained allowing the resolution to pass 140 
america has frequently used its veto power as one of the 
councils five permanent members to block resolutions criticizing 
israel 
the resolution did not explicitly accuse israel of killing 
khalil wazir the no 2 man in the palestine liberation 
organization but israeli sources and tunisian officials have said 
wazir was slain by israeli commandos 
wazir also known as abu jihad was shot to death april 16 at 
his home in suburban tunis 
israel has not made any official response to the claims that it 
was responsible for the assassination and it boycotted the council 
debate 
diplomats said the resolution probably would have been vetoed by 
the united states if it had specifically blamed israel 
the resolution condemns vigorously the aggression perpetrated 
against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of tunisia in 
flagrant violation of the charter of the united nations 
international law and norms of conduct 
the carefully negotiated text mentions israel by name twice 
it cites a 1985 resolution passed after israel bombed the plo 
headquarters which denounced acts of aggression and in the 
preamble notes tunisia complained to the council about a new 
israeli act of aggression 
us ambassador herbert okun said one reason the united states 
could not vote for the resolution was that it contained language 
suggesting sanctions 
the resolution expressed the councils determination to take 
the appropriate steps to ensure the implementation of the present 
resolution 
okun said the measure disproportionately places all blame for 
this latest round in the rising spiral of violence in the middle 
east on one event only while failing to mention other actions that 
preceded it 
israeli ambassador johanan bein contacted by telephone 
declined comment on the us abstention he accused the security 
council of putting israel on trial even though it has made no 
admission of responsibility 
he also said the council had ignored wazirs terrorist past and 
the fact that wazir masterminded a 1978 bus hijacking in which 35 
israelis were killed 
the plo including abu jihad took responsibility and 
glorified those acts of terrorism which they planned and 
perpetrated and the security council never dealt with it and never 
condemned it bein said 
both tunisia and the plo expressed satisfaction that the measure 
passed but it did not fully come up to our expectations said 
foreign minister mahmoud mestiri of tunis 
okun referred to tunisia as a friend of the united states and 
said the perpetration of political assassination on tunisian soil 
stands in stark contrast to tunisias longstanding tradition of 
nonviolence 
during three days of debate scores of speakers accused israel 
of practicing state terrorism 
the permanent members of the 15member council are the united 
states soviet union britain france and china 
although security council resolutions are considered binding 
they are often ignored

panamas new foreign minister said monday 
his top priorities are normalizing relations with the united states 
and persuading it to lift economic sanctions against his country 
jorge e ritter also said gen manuel antonio noriegas 
departure would not solve panamas problems unless it was part of a 
national dialogue with the opposition 
noriega commander of panamas 15000member defense forces has 
rejected us demands that he resign and leave the country 
washington responded by imposing economic sanctions against panama 
noriega who controls panamas civilian government was indicted 
in february by a federal grand jury in florida that accused him of 
being a drug trafficker 
lets suppose gen noriega would leave today ritter said in 
an interview would banks open immediately no would all the 
private companies go back in business no would all the people who 
lost their jobs because the us froze panamanian assest get their 
jobs back no 
ritter who described himself as a noriega loyalist had served 
for the past 14 months as panamas ambassador to the united 
nations he was named foreign minister sunday in a cabinet shuffle 
replacing jorge abadia 
ritter is to return to panama tuesday 
it is not in the interest of the united states or panama to 
keep this awkward relationship for long he said in the interview 
we have to get together and talk about it but its a very 
complicated thing i myself dont know exactly whats going to 
happen 
he urged the panamanian opposition to agree to a national 
dialogue that he said could include negotiations for noriegas 
resignation 
i think people are missing the point when they think gen 
noriegas departure is the final solution to panamas crisis he 
said we have to speak about the next elections we have to speak 
about the press that has been silenced we have to talk about the 
future of the economy 
opposition leaders in march rejected what they called an 
illdefined offer of negotiations with the government saying 
noriega must leave first 
if that noriegas departure is conceded from the beginning 
there is hardly anything that will bring panamanians and the 
government together for a dialogue ritter said there cannot 
be any preconditions for the dialogue

the senate on monday began debating a 
bill to ban nuclear weapons in the philippines and to prohibit 
nuclearcapable military ships from making port calls the measure 
is directed at us military bases 
sen wigberto tanada the main sponsor said the proposed 
freedom from nuclear weapons act would give the philippine 
government legal and moral authority to put the united states 
on the defensive once it is approved by the 23member senate and 
200member house of representatives 
us policy is to neither confirm nor deny the presence of 
nuclear weapons on its warships or at the clark air base and subic 
naval base they are the two main american bases here and filipino 
antinuclear activists claim they provide storage or transshipment 
points for nuclear arms 
our best information is that there are nuclear weapons in 
the bases and that is why we need to approve this legislation 
said tanada 
the bill is expected to pass the senate but to face strong 
opposition in the lower house 
tanada said the measure would reaffirm a constitutional 
provision that bans nuclear weapons from philippine territory 
consistent with the national interest 
a draft of the proposal says peaceful uses of nuclear energy 
and commercial nuclearpowered ships would be excluded 
nuclearcapable ships in distress would be allowed access to 
philippine waters for a limited duration and with the philippine 
presidents permission 
the bill proposes creation of a monitoring commission 
violators would face six years to life in prison with 
foreigners to be deported after serving their jail term 
also on monday defense secretary fidel ramos said filipino 
commanders should have access to all areas of the two large usrun 
military bases including rooms where sensitive messages are 
decoded 
the united states and the philippines are reviewing the 1947 
military bases agreement under which the americans maintain six 
military installations here 
the current agreement expires in 1991

emperor hirohito held a rare news conference monday 
to talk of his health and his fabled past as the worlds 
longestreigning monarch 
the annual news conference which will be broadcast friday on 
the emperors 87th birthday came as some japanese already were 
preparing for the death of the emperor 
medical equipment has been moved from a hospital on palace 
grounds into hirohitos living quarters so he can die at home said 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity access to the living 
area has been limited to close family members they said 
however they said there was no indication his health is failing 
some newspaper have already chosen the words they will use to 
announce his death 
at mondays news conference for 30 japanese reporters hirohito 
talked of world war ii and its aftermath said the sources it has 
been 13 years since his last news conference with foreign 
reporters when he denied planning the attack on pearl harbor but 
left many other questions unanswered 
on the throne since dec 25 1926 hirohito is especially known 
for his role as japans wartime leader who was considered 
semidivine he has ruled longer than any monarch alive 
the emperor underwent surgery sept 22 after complaining of 
weakness and nausea surgeons performed an intestinal bypass to 
relieve pressure on the intestines caused by an enlargement of the 
pancreas 
since then hirohito has resumed some duties but 54yearold 
crown prince akihito has taken an increasingly active role under 
the constitution hirohito is a symbol of japan not a political 
leader 
hirohito has been spending most of his time in the imperial 
palace a vast complex in the center of tokyo he has said he lives 
like a bird in a cage 
three days a week he goes into his office behind the grand 
meeting hall for foreign dignitaries 
twenty times a year the emperor holds religious ceremonies to 
mark such occasions as equinoxes the rice harvest and his 
birthday although he renounced his divinity at the end of world 
war ii hirohito still holds the position as the nations 
highestranking shinto priest 
japanese feelings toward the emperor differ greatly among 
generations 
there is strong reverence among the elderly who remember him 
when he was believed to be a god their first duties as 
schoolchildren during a fire were to remove the emperors portrait 
younger people born after the start of japans rapid economic 
growth tend to take less interest

a man accused of embezzling 11 
million from an iowa credit union nearly five years ago was 
arrested monday by authorities who said they had grown suspicious 
of his spending cash on a home and fancy cars 
steven hadley 40 was taken into custody without incident by 
fbi agents and police in this city near houston the fbi said 
friendswood police lt gary edwards recognized hadley after 
seeing his picture in a recent fbi flier issued in connection with 
the television series unsolved mysteries the fbi said 
hadley was reported missing by his wife in july 1983 the same 
time the 11 million disappeared from the john deere employees 
credit union in waterloo iowa where hadley had worked 
he left a note saying he could no longer cope with the pressures 
of job and family 
hes been here since 1984 when he bought a house but has no 
visible means of support edwards said 
hadley paid cash for the house and drove around town in a 
ferrari and an alpha romeo which he also bought for cash edwards 
said 
we did a reverse investigation edwards said we 
researched how he came into a lot of money when he bought his 
house and fancy cars in cash people were suspicious 
there was no doubt in my mind it was him when i saw the 
flier he said i was shocked i probably have 600 pages of 
reports on this guy from the last three years and he looks the 
same 
hadley admitted his identity following his arrest said 
nicholas v ohara fbi special agent in charge of the district 
office at omaha 
authorities believe that after his disappearance hadley took a 
july 21 flight to chicago but they were not able to track his 
movements he left behind a note to his family saying he took the 
money and fled because he could no longer cope with home and work 
pressures 
in part of the letter included in federal court documents 
hadley wrote to his wife this is a very difficult letter to 
write but i couldnt let you find out from someone else first if i 
call you to read this letter it means that i have successfully 
left the state with around 1 million from the credit union 
hadley had worked at the credit union for 10 years and was 
described as a reliable and respected employee 
his wife kathryn has since divorced hadley and retained 
custody of their three children ages 11 7 and 1 when their father 
disappeared 
hadley who is charged in iowa with credit union fraud and 
embezzlement is being held in texas pending an appearance before a 
us magistrate 
hopes of catching hadley rose in february when producers of the 
unsolved mysteries program arrived in waterloo to prepare for a 
segment on the missing cash and credit union employee 
during the show viewers are provided with a telephone number to 
call if they can identify a photo of the subject

one of the navys last dieselelectric 
submarines lay on the oceans surface tied to a rescue vessel 
monday after a underwater explosions and a toxic fire injured 22 
sailors and left three missing 
the 30yearold uss bonefish its remaining crew evacuated to 
shore bases floated alongside the submarine rescue ship uss petrel 
about 160 miles off florida said lt cmdr aaron long a spokesman 
at atlantic fleet headquarters in norfolk 
there was no apparent danger that the submarine which carries 
only conventional weapons would sink said chief petty officer 
terry d borton a fleet spokesman 
it was not known if the missing men were aboard the sub or in 
the water 
long said preliminary indications pointed toward a series of 
explosions including one in the battery compartment but he said 
he was unable to say precisely where the other explosions occurred 
on the ship the fire broke out in the forward battery compartment 
he said 
the charleston scbased uss petrel arrived on the scene 
monday afternoon but navy officials said any decision to board the 
submarine was being delayed until tuesday 
the decision made was that no one goes aboard until the 
petrels experts declare the ship free of dangerous fumes tuesday 
morning long said 
the petrel based in charleston sc was alongside the 
submarine with a line attached to keep the submarine from drifting 
long said 
they are waiting until daybreak to commence any operation no 
one has boarded the vessel at this point long said 
also steaming to the scene was the salvage ship uss hoist from 
the little creek amphibious base in norfolk 
the explosion occurred sunday afternoon in the boats battery 
compartment while the bonefish was submerged on a routine training 
mission said borton 
the explosion triggered a fire that filled the 219foot vessel 
with smoke and toxic fumes the sub surfaced and cmdr mike wilson 
the commander ordered it evacuated 
the frigate uss carr which also was in the training exercise 
took aboard 89 of the bonefishs 92 crewmen the mccloy which also 
was training nearby reached the bonefish before nightfall the 
navy said 
also steaming to the scene and expected to arrive tuesday was 
the salvage ship uss hoist from the little creek amphibious base in 
norfolk 
the bonefish was launched in 1958 from new york shipbuilding in 
camden nj it is powered on the surface by three 1500horsepower 
diesel engines that drive a single propeller and charge batteries 
while submerged the batteries power two electric motors 
the bonefish and its two sister ships the barbel and blueback 
are among the last of the navys dieselelectric submarines and are 
used principally to mimic soviet submarines in training exercises 
the soviets still operate about 100 dieselelectric boats 
the bonefish is the second navy vessel to bear that name the 
first a world war ii submarine disappeared in the sea of japan in 
june 1945 while on combat patrol 
the 22 injured were transferred to the aircraft carrier john f 
kennedy which steamed to mayport fla from there they were flown 
to the naval hospital in jacksonville the other crewmen were taken 
to mayport by the carr and flown to the charleston air force base 
where they arrived monday afternoon 
atlantic fleet headquarters said two sailors were seriously 
injured but the nature and extent of their injuries was not 
immediately available 
the majority of the sailors disembarked from the carr in mayport 
wearing blue overalls and sneakers though many were shoeless 
reporters were not allowed to talk to the crewmen when they 
returned to charleston they looked grim as they walked across the 
tarmac to meet about 30 waiting relatives one woman wore a jacket 
reading diesel boats forever beneath a cartoon of a submarine 
one bonefish sailor aboard a bus awaiting transport back to the 
navy base was asked if he and his shipmates were alright 
yes thank god for that said the unidentified crewman he 
refused to comment about conditions on the boat during the fire

pilots responding to a survey on airport safety 
rated los angeles international the most dangerous in the nation 
and dallasfort worth international the safest it was reported 
monday 
however many of the pilots said the main factor governing 
airport safety is people and that can vary at any facility at any 
time according to the survey conducted by the atlantic 
constitution 
the newspaper in february and march polled 2200 pilots who hold 
air transportation certificates asking them to list in no 
particular order the five safest and least safest airports 
the newspaper reporting the survey results in its monday 
editions said 1360 pilots responded the report did not include 
how many times a particular airport was named and did not list 
additional airports 
in addition to los angeles international the airports listed as 
the five least safe were washingtons national new yorks 
laguardia chicagos ohare and in a tie san diegos lindbergh 
field and denvers stapleton international 
in addition to the texas airport listed among the five safest 
facilities were ohare hartsfieldatlanta international 
washingtons dulles and seattletacoma 
many pilots in written comments said it was difficult to rate 
airports for safety 
it depends on the people wrote a continental pilot these 
constantly change so an airport that could be labeled unsafe today 
might not be tomorrow 
a trans world airlines pilot said it can be compared to the 
question where is the safest place to drive a car texas has 
great long and wide roads that are well lit but you better watch 
out because an animal or human with a gun might ruin your whole 
day the key is pilot complacency 
but quite a few pilots had gripes about specific airports some 
of the harshest criticism was reserved for washingtons national 
where pilots expressed displeasure with that airports noise 
abatement procedures and the ban on flying over national monuments 
nationals noise rules require them to cut power on takeoff 
while performing relatively tricky maneuvers at uncomfortably low 
altitudes 
this is particularly a consideration when aircraft are 
departing for long flights and may be loaded to or near maximum 
allowable weight wrote a pan am pilot with 22 years experience 
power loss in conjunction with lowaltitude maneuvering and even 
minimal wind shear or turbulence could be disastrous 
the rule about national monuments makes pilots take awkward 
routes in and out of the airport poll returns said 
national the airport of choice for congressmen and lobbyists 
remains open only for political convenience one pilot said 
los angeles international also drew the ire of many respondents 
among the problems at that airport pilots said was its varied mix 
of small planes and jumbo jets 
any airport that mixes light aircraft and commercial jet 
aircraft is less safe in direct proportion to the number of light 
aircraft using the facility one pilot wrote light aircraft 
are difficult to see and often do not show up on air traffic 
control radar 
chicagos ohare stood out for making both the fivesafest and 
fivemost dangerous lists it received praise from several pilots 
for its controllers ability to deal well with the combined 
pressures of heavy traffic and winter storms 
to get to laguardia pilots must run the gantlet between newark 
and kennedy airports both within 15 miles 
that can make approaches kind of dicey one pilot wrote 
laguardia also has strict noiseabatement rules similar to those at 
national 
the paper printed no specific comments on either the san diego 
or denver airports

britain on monday announced its approval of a 
374 billion jet fighter project involving four european nations 
britain was the first to declare its support of the european 
fighter aircraft no final decisions have been made by the 
governments of west germany italy and spain 
defense secretary george younger told parliament the british 
decision still depends on agreement by the three other countries 
the first of the 800 aircraft are to be in service in 1996 
british officials expect the defense ministers of the four 
countries will approve the project at a meeting in hanover west 
germany on may 11 
under a preliminary accord signed in september britain and west 
germany each will pay onethird of the cost italy 21 percent and 
spain 13 percent 
britain and west germany are to each order 250 of the warplanes 
with the first to come into service in 1996 
the estimated cost of each jet will be 49 million and some 
west german critics say that is too much 
younger said the european fighter aircraft will fulfill a 
vital defense need in the best and most costeffective way it will 
continue the trend of successful european collaboration in 
aerospace and it will ensure that our industry remains in the 
forefront of this technology to the end of the century and beyond 
denzil davies the opposition labor partys defense spokesman 
expressed relief that on this occasion at least the government 
has been forced to agree to european rather than american 
technology 
in 1986 britain scrapped its own surveillanceplane system that 
had cost millions of dollars and ordered instead airborne warning 
and control awacs aircraft produced by the seattlebased boeing 
co 
the european fighter aircraft is among the projects on which the 
united states and its european allies are supposed to share 
information to avoid duplication in developing technology

a former argentine general facing 
extradition has been ordered to pay 21 million to a lawyer who was 
held four years without charges and tortured repeatedly in a prison 
run by the generals soldiers 
the judgment against carlos suarez mason made public monday is 
the largest known damage award by a us district court for human 
rights abuses said joanne hoeper a lawyer for plaintiff horacio 
martinezbaca 
suarez mason commander of the first army corps in buenos aires 
from 1976 to 1979 during a period of military rule directed a 
pattern and practice of terror against the general population of 
argentina said the ruling by us district judge samuel conti 
suarez mason a fugitive from argentina who is being held 
without bail during extradition proceedings never submitted a 
response to the civil suit refused to answer pretrial questions 
and was held in default by conti 
suarez mason has insisted he has no money after spending his 
last 100000 on lawyers for his extradition case ray archuleta a 
lawyer who sought to represent suarez mason in the civil suit did 
not return a reporters calls 
suarez mason 64 fled argentina after a civilian government 
came to power in 1983 he was arrested in january 1987 at his home 
in foster city south of san francisco after argentina located him 
and requested his extradition 
another judge is scheduled to rule wednesday on argentinas 
attempt to extradite him on charges of 43 murders and 24 
kidnappings allegedly committed by soldiers under his command 
martinezbacas suit is one of three filed in the san francisco 
federal court by former argentinians who say they were tortured or 
their relatives killed by soldiers under suarez masons 
supervision 
us courts have allowed civil suits against foreigners in their 
jurisdiction for violations of internationally recognized human 
rights such as torture and summary execution 
martinezbaca a labor union lawyer and former local government 
official in mendoza argentina said he was arrested in march 1976 
six days after a military coup and tortured several times before 
his release in april 1980 he said suarez mason once intervened 
personally to block his release 
the damages can be collected against any of suarez masons 
assets that martinezbaca and his lawyers can find ms hoeper said 
she was skeptical about suarez masons claim of poverty 
this is someone who is alleged to have taken many millions of 
dollars when he was in a position of power in argentina she 
said he paid his attorneys 100000 in wire transfers from 
argentina and were sure theres more where that came from 
martinezbaca who lives in oakland and works in a law office 
said he doubted he would ever collect all the money he said he 
would donate half of anything he gets to a fund for victims of 
human rights abuses in argentina

signs of thawing in ussoviet relations are 
giving a measure of hope to some people in the strifetorn middle 
east the associated press chief correspondent there said monday 
they hope that there is a spinoff there for the middle east 
said nick tatro the aps chief of bureau in jerusalem we see in 
the middle east a certain loss of hope a very negative type of 
atmosphere he said 
tatro and four other ap executives and correspondents discussed 
the situation in their areas in a conversation with ap president 
louis d boccardi during the aps annual meeting here monday 
also participating in the discussion called the worlds 
hotspots a firsthand view were bryna brennan correspondent in 
central america terence p hunt chief white house correspondent 
michael putzel chief of bureau moscow and barry renfrew chief 
of bureau seoul 
the failure of secretary of state george p shultz and soviet 
foreign secretary eduard shevardnadze to find a breakthrough on 
arms control makes it sure that arms control will not be the 
centerpiece of the upcoming summit between president reagan and 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev said putzel 
despite that reagans staff will be looking for a big public 
relations gain for the president hunt said 
unless the president stumbles badly there is always a bounce 
that comes out of the summit he said 
reagan will address the soviet people and a group of soviet 
students during the may summit and will stress that if gorbachev is 
sincere about giving the soviet people more freedoms he should 
grant them passports to travel freely and ease the restrictions on 
the literature they can read hunt said 
renfrew said south korea was hoping for success is hosting the 
summer olympics 
they hope the olympics will launch the country on the path cut 
out for themselves as a second japan he said 
however north koreas potential for violeance cannot be 
underestimated he said and the north could engage in a major 
provocation and interrupt the olympics he said 
brennan said wars in guatemala el salvador and nicaragua were 
essentially civil wars which started as reaction to poverty and 
land distribution which was completely unfair

this nations main black labor 
federation warned monday of anger and confrontation if 
president pw botha fulfills a threat to impose wage controls in 
the private sector 
the government underestimates just how sensitive an issue 
wages is said frank meintjies spokesman for the congress of 
south african trade unions we completely reject the state 
presidents plans to impose a general wage freeze 
meintjies said botha may feel he can curb wages because black 
workers have no vote but he will have to deal with other 
consequences the anger and confrontation of millions of workers 
crucially located at the point of production 
the government imposed a wage freeze for public employees 
earlier this year as part of its campaign to curb the current 134 
percent annual inflation rate this drew bitter protests from white 
teachers and railway workers among others 
botha complained last week in parliament that the private sector 
was not holding down salaries and said legislation was being 
drafted to force wage and price restraints he said private 
employers were envisioning wage increases in the range of 15 
percent 
the reaction thus far from the private sector has been 
disappointing botha said it is becoming increasingly clear 
that this quid pro quo will not come about by means of persuasion 
or voluntary teamwork other mechanisms will have to be found

defense secretary george younger said monday that 
if fellow nato member denmark adopts a policy of forcing visiting 
ships to say if they are carrying nuclear arms britain will not be 
able to land troops there 
if we cannot send ships into that situation we clearly would 
not physically be able to deliver 13500 british troops of the uk 
mobile force on site without ships to transport them younger 
told a luncheon for foreign correspondents 
denmarks conservative prime minister poul schlueter has called 
an election for may 10 in a showdown with leftofcenter foes over 
the nuclear issue and its effect on the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
schlueter heads a minority coalition government he called the 
election rather than implement a parliamentary vote that could have 
forced visiting warships to declare if they had nuclear arms 
the united states and britain both refuse as a matter of 
policy to say if their warships carry nuclear arms 
denmark is a key nato country geographically britain is 
supposed to land reinforcements there as part of the defense 
strategy of the western alliance 
privately british officials have expressed concern that if 
denmark insists on a nuclear arms declaration norway greece and 
spain other nato members with strong antinuclear sentiments 
might follow suit 
britain and the united states have already stopped visits to new 
zealand a nonnato member because it insists that ships disclose 
the presence of nuclear arms on board 
we and our american allies have a very firm policy that we 
never confirm or deny that any of our ships has nor has not got 
nuclear weapons on board said younger it would be valuable 
information to the outside world to know either that they have or 
have not

a federal appeals court monday threw out a 
lower courts order requiring government prosecutors to share 
secret documents with lawyers for indicted teamsters president 
jackie presser 
pressers defense has claimed that the government documents 
would prove his innocence 
but a threejudge panel of the 6th us circuit court of appeals 
unanimously agreed that presser and two teamsters union 
codefendants had no constitutional right of access to the 
documents overturning a ruling last year by us district judge 
george white in cleveland 
federal prosecutors argued that they should be permitted to keep 
the documents confidential until presser and codefendants harold 
friedman and anthony hughes fellow officers of clevelands 
teamsters local 507 went on trial 
the trial is scheduled for july 12 in whites court the three 
defendants were charged in a may 1986 indictment with arranging a 
700000 payrollpadding scheme that put ghost employees on the 
payroll of local 507 
presser 60 is secretarytreasurer of local 507 as well as 
president of the 16 millionmember teamsters union 
the defense has argued that the documents would show that 
presser and the other defendants were serving as government 
informants and that the fbi had authorized the payrollpadding 
scheme 
in essence the district court concluded that the defense 
has a constitutional right to know the tactical strengths and 
weaknesses of the governments case against it appeals judge 
danny boggs wrote for the 6th circuit court 
the supreme court has never held that the constitution creates 
such a right and we do not believe that it exists boggs wrote 
defense lawyer john climaco contacted through his cleveland 
office said he was unaware of the ruling and declined immediate 
comment

government prosecutors said monday 
they will oppose a bid to reopen the trial of the sharpeville 
six a group of blacks convicted of complicity in a mob killing 
and sentenced to death 
pj van zyl registrar of the pretoria supreme court said the 
attorney general of transvaal province had filed a notice of 
intention to oppose the defense lawyers application to reopen the 
trial he said a ruling was expected may 3 
the defendants five men and a woman were granted a stay of 
execution on march 17 the day before they were scheduled to be 
hanged the stay was ordered after their lawyers filed papers 
claiming a key state witness had been coerced by police into giving 
false testimony 
defense lawyers asked that the trial be reopened to consider 
that claim and to review the credibility of other state witnesses 
many human rights organizations and western leaders have 
appealed to south africas whitecontrolled government to commute 
the death sentences 
the six were convicted of complicity in the september 1984 
killing of a black municipal councilor kuzwayo dhlamini during 
riots against rent increases in the black township of sharpeville 
south of johannesburg 
but they were not found guilty of physically contributing to 
dhlaminis death they were convicted under the doctrine of common 
purpose which holds defendants responsible if they are found to be 
participants in mob violence 
the government has said their conduct inluded throwing stones at 
dhlamini helping set his house afire and slapping a woman who 
begged the crowd not to burn him 
black government employees frequently are targets of militants 
battling to overthrow the government and its policy of apartheid 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

a row over cyprus on monday between greek and 
turkish officials led to cancellation of a european economic 
community meeting according to diplomats 
this is a very serious matter said one diplomat after an 
announcement that the turkeyeec association meeting was called off 
an eec official who like the diplomats spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the turkish delegation refused to take part in the 
meeting as a protest of the agendas mentioning the turkish 
occupation of cyprus 
he said the turkish delegation agreed to discuss political 
cooperation with the community over dinner but would not attend 
the talks themselves 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher of west germany failed 
to resolve the problem after more than three hours of closeddoor 
negotiations and postponed the meeting indefinitely 
genscher spokesman hansjurgen chroborg said west germany which 
holds the rotating eec presidency until the end of june hopes to 
reschedule the meeting before its term expires

angered over greeces insistence on including the turkish 
occupation of northern cyprus in the eec statement adopted by the 
communitys foreign ministers earlier monday 
the statement said ankaras occupation of the east mediterranean 
island has a bearing on the communitys relations with turkey 
the community went into the meeting with a broad declaration 
taking note of turkeys desire to improve relations with the 
12nation common market 
turkey wanted the talks to help release a longfrozen eec 
development credit of 748 million it also wanted a discussion of 
the free movement of turkish workers in the community and the 
removal of restrictions on turkish imports 
eec financial aid to turkey was frozen since the military coup 
in turkey in 1980 
despite a recent thaw in its relations with turkey greece said 
last week it would block the funding until turkish troops were 
withdrawn from cyprus it also said it wants improved treatment of 
the greek minority in turkey

there wont be any elephants but there will be a 
cast of 600 performing for an arena seating 15000 people in this 
summers aida extravaganza at earls hall 
it is the largest opera setting ever in britain the cavernous 
hall also used for ice shows and pop concerts covers 12 acres and 
was the largest reinforced concrete building in europe when it was 
built in 1937 
its seating capacity is six times greater than the royal opera 
house in covent garden and ticket prices at 40 and 4750 are 
about half the price of good seats at the opera house 
public fascination with giuseppe verdis opera first performed 
in cairo in 1871 abounds 
the tickets are going so well that we have extended the run 
from six nights to seven said lilian hochhauser who with her 
husband victor heads one of three groups of impresarios who got 
together to stage aida at earls court near kensington in west 
london 
the triumphal procession in aida has included elephants in 
some productions but animals were turned down for earls court 
elephants in egypt are totally historically inaccurate and 
camels were not originally known there either mrs hochhauser 
said everybody wants animals but i think perhaps its better not 
to start 
asked about a newspaper report that the impresarios expect a 2 
million profit she said nothing like that and you can say i 
laughed hysterically 
she also declined to say how much the production would cost 
we dont know what to expect because production costs have 
risen so enormously this is unknown territory theres never been 
an opera at earls court before and never one in britain on this 
scale she said 
i think there are thousands of people who are intrigued by 
opera and would like to hear one but they are put off by the price 
and the lowercost seats always sell out quickly 
they feel an opera house is not their world but they would 
feel more at home in a place like earls court she said 
mrs hochhauser said the royal opera and its rival the english 
national opera toyed over the years with the idea of going to 
earls court 
but they never came up with a solution to the set problem 
they didnt have one to fit she said 
american mezzosoprano grace bumbry will portray aida on opening 
night and give one extra performance while other international 
stars will rotate in the leading roles 
the production is the idea of italian director and designer 
vittorio rossi who has put on similar shows in indoor stadiums in 
paris and zurich 
aida the grandest of grand operas tells of the love of 
radames captain of the pharaohs guard for aida a slave and 
daughter of the king of ethiopia whom radames has captured 
radames tricked into betraying military secrets is buried alive 
and aida chooses to die with him 
the tricky task of projecting the singers voices to all parts 
of the hall is being solved by having the singers wear tiny radio 
microphones the producers say the distances are so great that the 
mikes are unlikely to be visible 
the london symphony orchestra will perform with 85 musicians 
conducted by nello santi the london city ballet is also taking 
part as well as the ambrosian opera chorus of 200 
the production opens on sunday june 26 and runs through saturday 
july 2

for william broyles jr vietnam veteran 
author and former magazine editor the juxtaposition of an 
evacuation hospital and an randr center near da nang seemed the 
perfect tv setting to capture not just the wars horror but also 
its black humor 
china beach the show broyles cocreated with 
writerproducer john sacret young premieres tonight as a twohour 
movie on abc then will run for six wednesdays 
it tells the story of vietnam from a different perspective that 
of three women in vietnam in late 1967 a nurse a red cross 
volunteer and an entertainer 
china beach is the name of a real area said broyles i 
was there during the war its south of da nang on the ocean its 
like an incountry restandrecreation area right next to it was 
the 95th evacuation hospital those two worlds are what the shows 
all about it had a strange club med atmosphere and the very 
intense reality of the hospital 
if theres any word id use its the contrast between the 
randr area and the hospital this is not a war story but the war 
setting does give us the opportunity for great drama and great 
comedy because of the intense activity 
the deepest humor is when you laugh in the presence of death 
when i was in vietnam some of my friends were killed but we still 
laughed thats how you survived were going for that kind of 
humor 
the series stars dana delany as nurse colleen mcmurphy chloe 
webb as singer laurette barber and nan woods as red cross worker 
cherry white 
few series have looked at women at war broadside in 196465 
was more or less the distaff side of mchales navy operation 
petticoat was a brief show in 197778 about army nurses aboard a 
pink submarine in world war ii there was mash of course 
with famous nurse margaret houlihan but the viewpoint on the 
nurses in korea was strictly male 
you meet these women and you get enthusiastic about them 
said broyles they went there to serve not to kill they went 
there to help their fellow man i dont want to sound too 
pretentious but thats what these women did weve got a wealth of 
stories about them one of our writers susan rhinehart was in the 
army in vietnam 
broyles and young worked with women who had served in vietnam 
who helped not only with the scripts but with the sets the movie 
was filmed in hawaii and indian dunes an area north of los 
angeles where the sets for the randr area and hospital were 
built 
broyles 43 was a combat marine lieutenant in vietnam in 1969 
and returned in 1984 as a writer looking for material for his book 
brothers in arms a journey from war to peace 
he was one of the first combat veterans to return i wanted to 
meet the people i had fought against he said 
broyles founded texas monthly magazine in 1972 with michael 
levy later they bought new west magazine and changed the name to 
california from there broyles went to newsweek as editorinchief 
in 1982 he stayed with the magazine for two years 
broyles had suggested the concept of the television series to 
scott kaufer vice president of development at warner bros 
television kaufer had worked with broyles as an editor on 
california magazine 
then john came in as executive producer said broyles he 
has an extensive knowledge of vietnam and hes never been there 
we worked together on the pilot and he wrote the script

a white elephant in thailand is not 
anything you blithely unload white elephants here are revered and 
pampered as national treasures 
thailand today is the home of the white elephant believed to 
have given rise years ago to the term white elephant of the 
other kind 
but thais dont demean the beasts by calling them white 
elephants they call them auspiciously significant elephants 
they are modern thailands link to the days when kings rode 
elephants into battle and fought over the white ones 
white elephants today reside in finely appointed stables are 
assigned two caretakers each and daily consume up to 660 pounds of 
specially purchased greenery garnished with papayas bananas and 
other elephant delicacies 
white elephants are by law offered to the king and the current 
monarch bhumibol adulyadej has 11 of them they make themselves 
very much at home around his palace strolling on manicured lawns 
bathing in a lake and liberally stripping the royal foliage 
white elephants which are said to bestow good fortune on their 
owners dont come without expense the herd doesnt earn its keep 
which includes of food bill equivalent to several thousand dollars 
a month 
hence the term white elephant as used elsewhere to mean a 
possession maintained at very high expense with very little in 
return 
while the term in that sense isnt used in the thai language 
the english one may have originated from the practice of old thai 
monarchs giving white elephants to nobles such gifts could hardly 
be refused and the creatures proceeded to eat their masters out of 
house and home 
in former times the earliest records of their capture date to 
the 15th century white elephants bathed behind a screen to 
protect them from commoners eyes kings of thailand siam in those 
days and burma went to war over them 
beliefs some still extant grew up around them ailing 
children it is said can be cured by walking or crawling under 
their bellies the hair from the tails of white elephants 
incorporated into rings can ward off evil 
the fortunes of all elephants have since declined in thailand 
massive deforestation has dramatically depleted the wild population 
to probably fewer than 2000 
modern machines and roads have reduced elephants usefulness in 
the logging industry and as beasts of burden domesticated 
elephants which numbered nearly 13500 in 1950 are down to fewer 
than 4000 today 
roundups in the jungles royal processions of caparisoned 
animals the thundering charges of elephants in battle have been 
replaced by spectacles that some traditionalists regard as less 
than dignified today elephants play soccer take part in mock 
combat and lift their trunks on command in hotel reception areas 
for the amusement of tourists 
only a few outsiders are allowed into the stables of the white 
elephants at chitralada villa where the animals ranging in age 
from 10 to 59 years are protected from undue stress disease and 
any wouldbe human predators killing a white elephant is 
punishable by five years in prison 
phiphatanachatr diskul a veterinarian assigned to the white 
elephants medical care said the elephants get a blood test every 
six months and are given medicines and vitamins as needed 
initially the keepers tried to sneak pills into bananas sticky 
rice and other food but since the animals gingerly discarded them 
a 4inch syringe now is used 
to warrant such attention an elephant must have 11 special 
characteristics including whitish eyes and a pinkish palette white 
elephants or albinos are rarely if ever all white but rather 
mottled with offwhites and other skin tones other than the 
standard elephant gray 
once such an elephant is found the word makes its way up 
through official channels to the royal household in bangkok an 
expert is dispatched and looks for the requisite characteristics 
he also assesses the beasts personality bearing and even whether 
it possesses a pleasantsounding snore if those tests are met he 
proclaims the animal an auspiciously significant elephant 
at a later date the king presides over an elaborate induction 
ceremony the roots of which lie deep in hindu and buddhist lore 
sawej thanapradit an 82yearold expert who has worked with 
royal elephants most of his life said the traditions and rituals 
surrounding white elephants once also existed in laos burma 
cambodia and sri lanka formerly ceylon but political and social 
changes in those countries have turned royal white elephants into 
mere albinos 
in thailand they will be with us a very long time sawej 
said explaining that auspiciously significant elephants are 
closely linked to the monarchy which remains a vigorous 
institution

you can describe what is happening 
in the country like this said the head of a major company as he 
drew a circle on a piece of paper have you ever seen a snake 
eating its tail 
trapped in the standoff between gen manuel antonio noriega on 
one side and the local opposition and reagan administration on the 
other panamanians are using up what little panama has left with 
dim prospects of getting more 
the country is becoming paralyzed and now we are in the phase 
of eating up our inventories said the panamanian who is the 
general manager of a major american company here like most 
businessmen here he spoke only condition of anonymity because of 
the sensitive situation 
there is going to be a total exhaustion of supplies on hand 
he added if we cant import raw materials when the inventories 
run out we cant produce 
banks have been closed to the public by government order since 
march 4 because of cash shortages following monthslong runs on 
accounts and a us freeze on panamanian assets as part of the plan 
to force noriega out as strongman 
without banks the local economy runs on a cashonly basis even 
the most reliable customers have lost the credit they had with 
suppliers 
some panamanian and foreign banks reopened april 18 but only to 
accept deposits 
except for some foods such as rice an essential here and a few 
manufactured goods panama runs on imports 
the situation became critical feb 26 the day noriega 
engineered the ouster of president eric arturo delvalle for issuing 
an order firing the general noriega had just been indicted in the 
united states on drug trafficking charges 
hardly anyone seems to have escaped in the aftermath 
like everyone else harinas panama one of the countrys three 
flour mills cant buy wheat because its supplier wants cash for it 
general manager tirso a wolfschoon said the company is 
negotiating to get more wheat but then there might not be any bags 
to put the flour in he said his suppliers are having trouble 
getting materials for cloth and plastic bags 
an association of insurance companies announced it cant pay 
claims and its clients cant pay premiums 
construction is virtually halted equipment stands idle at the 
concrete skeletons of twin 24story condominium towers on prime 
real estate 
colgate palmolive a wholly owned branch of the us company 
is selling from its inventories of toothpaste detergents and other 
personal care and cleaning products like many others companies it 
has given its employees vacations but general manager carlos 
rodriguez said that when worker get back from their vacations the 
factory will use up its inventories 
the main problem will be the massive unemployment this can 
generate he said 
for 10 years panama has been selfsufficient in rice but 
growers say farmers arent planting because of the lack of credit 
and uncertainty over whether theyll be able to get fertilizers and 
other chemicals 
rice on hand normally would last through june or july they say 
but in the crisis people are buying only essentials and rice is 
at the top of the list 
supermarkets are still wellstocked nicolas psychoyos of the 
rey chain said sales are running at 40 percent of last years some 
imported items such as breakfast cereals cooking oils and canned 
fruits are running low but local brands and all essentials are 
available 
activity in the cluster of white towers of the international 
banking center that grew up here in the 1970s is near a standstill 
according to one estimate 50 to 70 of the 118 foreign banks 
have closed or are in the process of closing others say none have 
closed officially 
some panamanian economists said they hold out hope that the 
center can revive at least on some scale but others say it is all 
but gone and that business is already moving to britains cayman 
islands in the caribbean south of cuba 
to survive the panamanian business instinct has come up with 
some creative answers 
some companies like colgate have been paying employees with as 
much cash as they can muster giving it to the lowestscale 
workers the rest receive coupons to buy food at supermarkets 
supermarkets and some other businesses are accepting the 
paychecks of government employees and in turn using them to pay 
utility bills 
supermarkets also are accepting checks of low denominations from 
suppliers employees then returning them for supplies 
some businesses are resorting to barter 
psychoyos of the rey supermarket chain said he has exchanged 
food or cancelled overdue accounts for windows doors reinforcing 
rods wood cinder block trucks of fruit and just about anything 
that has value to it 
well find someone who needs them and pay them with that he 
said 
a beer distributor in the provinces accepted food in payment 
then used the food to pay its employees 
even if the situation is resolved soon recovery will take years 
and depend on the influx of foreign aid according to businessmen 
and economists 
some panamanians now question the economic pressure the united 
states is using to force noriega out and reduce the role of his 
panama defense forces 
right now theres no winner in panama said one were 
all losers

concerned that some military men 
might still be restless in the barracks argentinas civilian 
government is running television spots to promote democracy 
democracy comes from a greek word meaning peoples choice 
the narrator says solemnly in one of them 
the commercials follow revolts at three army camps last year and 
similar uprisings three months ago at six army garrisons by the 
cashiered rebel leader lt col aldo rico 
the military which has a history of intervention in government 
turned government over to civilians in 1983 after ruling for seven 
years 
president raul alfonsins radical civic union party and the 
opposition peronist party have began debate on a law to amend the 
constitution to strengthen civilian rule and reform the military to 
keep the armed forces out of politics 
this country is tired of the continous agitations provoked by 
a small group that does not represent the general sentiment in the 
armed forces said antonio cafiero the governor of buenos aires 
province chairman of the peronist party and a leading 
presidential candidate 
no civilian president in argentina has completed a full term in 
60 years the military has toppled governments here six times since 
1930 most recently when isabel peron was ousted in 1976 as the 
successor to her husband president juan d peron 
alfonsin has 20 months left in his sixyear term 
but recent events indicate domestic instability recent 
terrorist bombings in this capital and cordoba wounded four people 
including two federal policemen one terrorist suspect was killed 
by police 
prorico graffiti has spread from shantytowns outside buenos 
aires to downtown near the seat of government 
rico is a patriot rico is god and rico is freedom 
the graffiti says 
rico is being held pending rebellion charges in the magdalena 
military prison 62 miles south of buenos aires the prison is where 
five former military leaders including two military expresidents 
also are held 
the five leaders of the former military junta were convicted by 
the alfonsin government for their roles in human rights abuses 
during argentinas dirty war a campaign waged in the late 
1970s by the military against alleged leftist subversion 
at least 9000 civilians vanished without a trace according to 
a government panel but human rights groups say the number of 
people abducted tortured and ultimately disappeared is closer 
to 30000 
a year ago flashing tv spots saying democracy or 
dictatorship urged civilians to take to the streets to show 
support of the government during military uprisings april 1521 in 
buenos aires cordoba and tucuman 
alfonsin won the surrender of rico at campo de mayo argentinas 
largest army base in suburban buenos aires and told 400000 people 
assembled in the central plaza de mayo the house is in order and 
no blood was shed 
when new rebel uprisings in january ended after 96 hours with 
ricos surrender again alfonsin said we have again put our 
house in order 
but in the past year conditions have worsened on the economic 
and social fronts 
argentina had to renegotiate its 543 billion foreign debt 
thirdlargest in latin america and inflation has run at a rate of 
206 percent in the 12month period workers are restive because 
their wages buy less and less and alfonsins party was routed in 
congressional and gubernatorial elections by the resurgent 
peronists 
human rights groups such as the mothers of the plaza de mayo 
made up of relatives who lost loved ones in the dirty war 
charged alfonsin caved in to rico and that he pushed a law through 
congress that pardoned most officers accused of rights atrocities 
rico meanwhile has attracted support from rightist groups such 
as national alert an organization that favors a return to military 
rule 
three army officers have gone underground since february 
announcing they sided with rico and planned to fight what they 
described as the marxist enemy 
rico maintains the military should not be penalized for tactics 
he described as necessary in its 1970s war against subversion or be 
blamed for the embarrassing loss to britain in the 1982 falklands 
war 
while rico has found support among younger midlevel army 
officers he is the butt of many local jokes particularly about 
his surrendering after vowing to fight to the finish 
argentines say rico has broken an unofficial record by 
surrendering three times in six years first during the falklands 
war where he was a decorated commando and twice at his own 
rebellions

the roughly chiseled features and 
downcast eyes are all that remain as reminders of the little girl 
who lived here more than 2000 years ago 
nearby looking down at her in the excavation stood another 
little girl this one from the modern village that had been built 
atop the ancient saar burial mounds where the chiseled stone was 
found in february 
the village girls hair was cut short like that of the girl in 
stone they could have been sisters had they not been born 20 
centuries apart 
the little girl tombstone is one of five identified as 
belonging to the tylos culture that existed on this island in the 
persian gulf around the time of christ 
the thousands of ancient graves on bahrain 30 miles long and 10 
miles across at its widest point once gave rise to a theory that 
it was used as a regional burying ground 
however the danish archaeologist bruno frolich among others 
says there is no existing evidence that requires us to assume 
that the dead were anything other than inhabitants of bahrain 
island 
over the years many of these burial sites have been obliterated 
by population and urban growth a process that continues the saar 
mounds are being excavated under pressure from developers who own 
the property and are impatient to have it cleared 
our problem is that the construction of new buildings is 
coming very quickly said abdul aziz sowaileh the superintendent 
of archaeology bahrain would like to build houses houses and 
everywhere you dig in bahrain you will find some evidence of the 
prehistoric or ancient past 
so we cant preserve all the mounds but we try to do our best 
to preserve as many as we can 
at this site known as the baby grave 85 graves radiate 
from the center of a giant burial mound with the most recent at 
the outer edges 
thirtyfive jars containing skeletal remains of infants were 
also found here giving the site its name 
sowaileh said some burial jars pottery and skeletal remains 
probably will be removed and exhibited in bahrains new national 
museum 
ancient writings suggest bahrain may have been the garden of 
eden described in the old testament the sumerians of what is now 
southern iraq knew the island as dilmun during the bronze age 
some 4500 years ago 
succeeding cultures built atop earlier ones making this a rich 
area for archaeologists although most of the saar mounds a few 
miles west of manama bahrains main city are older this 
particular site dates from the grecoroman period 200 bc200 
ad when the island was called tylos 
for centuries bahrain which is near the persian gulfs western 
shore has been a stoppingoff place for traders merchants 
pirates and armies on the move 
alexander the great never reached bahrain during 13 years of 
conquering the world as he knew it but some of his generals did 
along with skeletal remains the contents of other graves 
escaped pillage over the years one family mound has yielded a 
trove of about 1000 items necklaces glazed pottery and 
glassware some in relatively good condition 
the mounds are rounded cones enclosing burial chambers or grave 
complexes from afar they resemble giant anthills up close they 
are distinguished from natural formations by their even appearance 
some rise to about six feet others are at ground level at this 
site the chambers are generally below ground cut into bedrock 
bahrain still has about 100000 known burial mounds 
in 1880 a british officerexplorer el durand wrote in his 
journal mighty mounds bare of vegetation tower above the palm 
groves mass upon mass mound upon mound they stretch on in 
endless chains all round the slope that falls from the cliffs to 
the sea 
the 30 tylos mounds of which the family site is one could 
prove important in the study of the tylos civilization sowaileh 
said it shows for example that people of that time made glazed 
pottery 
we also notice a change in burial customs from this period 
he said people are buried clothed their positions are changed 
so they are placed on their backs and put into some kind of 
coffin we didnt see these things before the greeks came to 
bahrain 
he said the discovery of more than 300 silver greek coins some 
bearing the likeness of alexander the great indicate that ancient 
tylos like modern bahrain was a flourishing trade center 
sowaileh surveying the gravesite as he spoke said the 
craftsmanship of such artifacts as the little girl tombstone is 
local 
there are other tombstones very similar to this one that 
have inscriptions in greek and must have been made for the greek 
people living here at the time but they dont have the facial 
representation like this one he said of the little girl in stone 
the little girl from the village had wandered off by now to 
rejoin her playmates digging in dirt piled near the mound 
her past is only now being discovered

from random insults on the street to 
graffiti in dorms to fistfights on fraternity row black students 
say part of their education at the university of wisconsinmadison 
is learning how to deal with racism 
geneva brown 23 copresident of the black student union has 
received hate mail and heard herself called a spook and 
jungle bunny 
this environment is hostile to blacks she says there is 
no reason for any black person to come here or stay here 
solomon ashby 21 who came to madison on a football scholarship 
from portsmouth va says it was a severe culture shock i went 
from a community where everyone i saw was black to being a total 
minority after five years the senior says i still find it 
very stressful im in a zoology class of 500 where i am the only 
black student 
there are 722 blacks among madisons 43368 students or 166 
percent that is down from 906 seven years ago when blacks 
comprised 23 percent of the students its among the smallest 
percentages of any major us university 
racial incidents have erupted into protests on other campuses 
from the 1986 world series dispute that spilled over into a racial 
brawl at the university of massachusettsamherst to protests at the 
university of michiganann arbor over racist jokes on a campus 
radio station to a furor over a fraternity sex show at the 
university of pennsylvania 
at pennsylvania state university 89 activists most of them 
black were arrested in april for occupying a building in a protest 
over that institutions failure to achieve a courtordered goal of 
5 percent black enrollment some 2424 or 36 percent of penn 
states 67278 students are black penn states president bryce 
jordan later dropped the charges 
the upsurge in racial incidents and strife coupled with lagging 
black enrollments on many campuses is prompting many colleges to 
mount new drives to achieve minority hiring and enrollment gains 
that have eluded them in the past 
robert h atwell president of the american council on 
education says we have hit the wall on minority participation 
and are loath to face the tough road ahead our own inner fatigue 
has been accentuated by an administration that has not seen equity 
issues as important 
the council has enlisted former presidents carter and ford as 
cochairman of a blueribbon commission that will issue a report 
this spring on problems that may lie ahead for the united states if 
more minorities dont graduate from college 
kenneth shaw president of the 26campus university of wisconsin 
system which has only 3190 blacks among its 161887 students 
says this isnt a sunday school lesson were talking about 
were approaching a situation by the year 2000 where a third of our 
young people going into the work force are going to be minorities 
we cant afford for them to undereducated 
the extent of educators concern was evident at a recent 
videoconference on racism on campuses the conference was organized 
by the johnson foundation and governors state university and seen 
by 11000 people on 176 campuses 
in panel discussions at the wingspread conference center in 
racine wis and interviews on the madison campus and elsewhere 
experts agreed that todays racial problems are different from the 
outright legal discrimination that once kept black students from 
college campuses 
reginald wilson who directs the office of minority concerns for 
the american council on education says much of the student protest 
arises from a wellspring of alienation fed by daytoday kind 
of indignities inside and outside the classroom 
he says that in student surveys 70 percent of minority students 
will say weve got real problems while 70 percent of white 
students will say this is a wonderful place 
raymond mack a northwestern university sociologist said it 
is the casualness of racism the fact that it is built into 
american society that makes it such a continuing problem and so 
hard to deal with its the little flick flick flicks that hurt 
not the one blow 
while atwell and others view hispanic enrollment rates as 
abysmally low it is the rate among blacks that has attracted 
the most attention and it has been blacks who have been subjected 
to most widely noted incidents of racism on campuses 
according to the us department of educations center for 
education statistics black college enrollments fell almost 3 
percent between 1980 and 1984 but increased slightly by 1986 the 
latest year for which the figures are available the department 
says its survey indicated there were 1081000 blacks enrolled in 
fall 1986 down from the peak of 1107000 in 1980 
but over the past decade the black share of enrollment has 
sagged from 94 percent to 86 percent at the same time census 
bureau figures show the percentage of black high school graduates 
ages 18 to 24 enrolled in college dropped from 335 percent in 1976 
to 261 percent in 1985 
only 261 percent of the black high school graduates attended 
college down from a peak of 335 percent in 1976 according to the 
census bureau 
the main problem of access is the kid who doesnt have the 
stuff to go says education secretary william bennett among 
students with similar academic achievements black students are 
just as likely or more likely than white students to go to 
college 
most higher education institutions have been diligent about 
recruiting black students bennett says the most serious 
underlying barrier to greater black college enrollment is the need 
to enlarge the pool of black students who have had the right 
preparation 
black men in particular are passing up college they were 
outnumbered by black female college students 645000 to 436000 
in 1986 the department of education says 
in 1985 34455 black women received bachelors degrees 3 
percent more than in 1976 but the number of black male graduates 
23018 was down 10 percent for that same period

overall black enrollment in the university of wisconsin system 
has slid 15 percent since 1980 other states are wrestling with 
similar figures in new jerseys nine state colleges and 
universities black undergraduate enrollment dropped from 18366 in 
1980 to 14237 in 1985 in rhode island 1975 blacks were enrolled 
in colleges and universities in 1986 down from 2213 in 1980 
shaw the president of the wisconsin system kicked up a storm 
last november by proposing free tuition for all minorities who 
maintained a cplus average in core academic subjects in high 
school 
the idea drew fire from many sides including minority leaders 
at the madison campus who feared it would arouse new enmity against 
blacks and other minority students some said cplus students 
didnt deserve scholarships 
in a revised design for diversity shaw has proposed 
doubling minority enrollments by 1993 in part with 1700ayear 
grants available to 500 disadvantaged wisconsin residents not 
just minorities 
shaw also wants to raise minority faculty and staff hiring by 75 
percent and to groom 15 new minority phds each year for teaching 
jobs in the system the total price tag over four years is nearly 
17 million 
shaw builds on the socalled madison plan that new university of 
wisconsin chancellor donna e shalala unveiled in february six 
weeks after arriving in madison and finding on her desk a thick 
pile of recommendations from a studentfaculty steering committee 
on minority affairs 
shalala a onetime carter administration housing official came 
to wisconsin by way of the presidency of new york citys hunter 
college where 60 percent of the 19000 students are minorities 
her blueprint fashioned after a frenetic round of meetings with 
faculty student staff and community leaders calls for doubling 
freshman minority enrollment by 1993 hiring 70 new minority 
faculty over the next three years and 125 minority staff members 
at duke university in durham nc the faculty advisory council 
reversed itself last month following faculty and student protests 
and required each of the institutions more than 50 departments to 
hire one more black faculty member by 1993 
the university of wisconsin faculty senate is being asked to 
approve an ethnic studies course requirement and shalalas 
administration endorsed construction of a multicultural center for 
students although not one left solely in the hands of minority 
students as activists had called for 
shalala found 16 million in existing funds to launch the plan 
and is asking the state legislature for 47 million more for its 
first three years some of the money will go into financial aid for 
the disadvantaged 
big debts have become a routine part of college life for many 
students in the past decade with the federal government shifting 
its emphasis from grants to loans many educators suspect that is a 
prime reason why the black share of college enrollment has dropped 
they say the military is also recruiting a growing share of black 
high school graduates with its promise of both training and a 
paycheck 
david wright 23 minority affairs director for the wisconsin 
student association says a lot of people just dont feel like 
going out and taking out 20000 in loans thats what ive had to 
do 
then theres the army be all you can be its tempting 
says wright a senior from milwaukee who is one of 11 children i 
know people who have college degrees who cant buy a job and i 
know people who got jobs out of high school and are making money i 
dream of 
fellow senior solomon ashby says a lot of people see this 
high level of education as superfluous theyd much rather get into 
the job force right after high school a lot of the trade skills 
are making much more money than people with a bachelor of arts 
degree 
ashby has worked summers in the shipyards back in portsmouth as 
an 8anhour painter and has seen buddies who chose not to return 
to college the future may be somewhat limited he says but 
the jobs pay more than beginning teachers make 
charles holley 23 from chicago also a senior political 
science major and copresident of the black student union says 
i dont think madison has a good image in terms of black 
students everybody who has friends who go to madison knows there 
is nothing for you to do if youre black up here theres no black 
musicthe social life is essentially null and void 
shalala says what i want to do is make this place more like 
the real world more multiethnic more multicultural there is a 
new generation of leaders not only in higher education but in 
this society we have come up through the civil rights movement 
through the peace movement and through the womens 
movementtwenty years ago i was one of those demonstraters and i 
promised myself if i ever got into a position of power i would be 
different in the way in which i led an institution 
the 47yearold shalala says madison will build its minority 
enrollment numbers the hard way including finding transfer

editors note in pennsylvania birthplace of the oil industry 
pumping crude and gas is a way of life for many small operators 
theyre not about to yield to regulators whose environmental rules 
they say are ruinously adding to their costs even if it makes 
them look like moonshiners

falling oil prices and tough new 
environmental regulations have don taylor producing oil like a 
bootlegger working a still 
were running illegal says taylor a short stocky man who 
fiercely protects his 150 oil wells from inquisitive state 
officials 
every time my black lab barks i look to see whether its the 
law its just like moonshining but what choice do we have 
taylor refuses to register his wells with state authorities 
if they have a problem he says they should know where the 
problem is so far hes managed to avoid investigators because of 
spotty enforcement and legal challenges to the new regulations 
its not a matter of being a hero or a smart aleck he says 
referring to his candor its just a matter of trying to 
survive 
defiance is not uncommon among small producers in this the 
oldest oil and gas field in the world here the first oil well was 
drilled in 1859 and the first gas well in 1868 
operating on the shady side of the law may mean the difference 
between making a living and going bankrupt says taylor he 
estimates it would cost him about 100000 to be legal 
complying with state regulations which include a 25000 bond 
and expensive rules for discharging brine and plugging unused 
wells may cost more than the 5aday revenues realized from the 
average oil well and 8 a day from the average gas well in 
pennsylvania 
the regulations probably would have gone down easier had they 
not accompanied the worst price collapse in the history of the 
energy industry a collapse that has hurt the nations other 32 
oil and gas producing states as well 
this has been the worst depression in the oil industry since 
the 1930s says ron harris spokesman for the independent 
petroleum association of america which represents 7000 
independent oil and gas producers 
a lot of independents are struggling 
about 20 miles away near the village of knox dwight stover 
maneuvers his fourwheeldrive pickup up a steep rutted trail to 
check for the last time on wells that have been oozing fuel as 
predictably as old faithful for almost 100 years 
in this pristine setting populated by wild turkeys deer black 
bear and grouse forests of hemlocks and mountain laurel camouflage 
one of the most densely developed natural gas areas in the state 
many of the wells are still flowing although at low volumes 
kept alive by thousands of small operators like taylor and stover 
small producers started the oil and gas industry more than 120 
years ago theyre the wildcatters who explored new oil fields 
drilled new gas wells and resurrected abandoned sites and even in 
these times of multinational conglomerates their lowvolume wells 
called stripper wells still make up threequarters of the nations 
total 
you cant afford to drill a new well to get 10 gallons of oil 
a day but if you can sell 10 gallons of oil at a decent price you 
can pump that well indefinitely says stover a trim man of 54 
whos been producing gas for 20 years 
but while the worlds appetite for gas and oil continues to 
grow a host of problems including rockbottom prices stringent 
environmental regulations arab oil and restricted pipelines have 
forced the grandchildren of the energy pioneers out of business 
you know everybody would like to own an oil well everybody 
thinks that all you need is an oil well to be rich but thats the 
farthest thing from the truth said stover he recently turned 
off his 97 gas wells after his main customer a glass plant went 
out of business 
three years ago i had an offer of 750000 for my wells 
today i dont think i could give them away 
in 1986 us crude oil dropped to 10 a barrel from a march 
1981 high of 3470 according to the independent petroleum 
association of america 
currently prices hover around 1425 a barrel for us crude and 
16 for pennsylvania grade crude a paraffinbased oil prized for 
its lubricating qualities 
for the states stripper wells which average onethird a barrel 
per day or 14 gallons the yield is about 5 a day a mere drop in 
the bucket compared to the 200 barrels daily produced by a typical 
mediumsized oil well in texas or oklahoma 
legislators think in barrels and we talk gallons thats why 
it takes so many wells to survive says taylor 45 who owns 
several 100yearold wells

natural gas rates vary widely depending on the contracts 
producers have with their customers but generally they average 
about 230 per thousand cubic feet in pennsylvania stripper gas 
wells yield about 3500 cubic feet a day about 8 according to 
steve rhoads of the pennsylvania oil and gas association 
this is a technical business stover says i dont mean to 
overplay it but if someone gave the average guy 10 oil wells and 
he attempted to produce them hed be a lot poorer at the end of 
two years than if he didnt do anything it takes a lot of 
innovation and technical savvy to make money with all the equipment 
in an oil well when you get only 4 a day 
compounding the economic troubles for pennsylvanias oil and gas 
operators is a new package of stringent environmental regulations 
passed in 1984 rhoads calls them vindictive overkill 
theres no way any individual operator can afford to comply 
with the current structure of the regulations he says its 
not a problem of law its a problem of the way the laws are 
administered problems the bureaucrats have discretion over 
we always survived the low price before you just learn to run 
your operation to what your oil or gas check is taylor says 
but we didnt have all this environmental threat theyve got the 
penalties so far out of range and theres no way in gods world we 
could comply 
rhoads acknowledges that before the law was passed the industry 
was mostly selfpolicing drilling permits were free and operators 
could do what they wanted in fact he says pennsylvania was 
one of the last states to adopt environmental regulations for the 
energy industry 
but the new law he says dealt with worstcase scenarios rather 
than everyday problems to which were added excessive fees and 
burdensome paperwork in one permit process for instance stover 
spent more than 373 in postage to send 97 applications to the 
state because each had to be mailed individually 
the new law includes a 2500perwell bond for fewer than 10 
wells or 25000 bond for 10 or more wells and a 
presumptionofguilt clause that makes operators liable for 
drinking water contamination if the pollution occurs within 1000 
feet of their well abandoned wells must be plugged within a year 
which rhoads says can easily cost more than 5000 per well 
rather than allowing operators to standardize the method of 
discharging brine a common byproduct of oil drilling the act 
requires separate plans for each discharge point which can cost 
6000 to 50000 per permit rhoads says 
many small independents say they would rather sell than deal 
with such regulations even that may not be feasible under current 
prices 
its impossible to sell or even give away property with 
inactive wells i know because i tried says willard cline 63 
from bradford who owns several hundred wells near the new york 
border any buyer would have to bond the wells and be 
approved by the state he would have to put aside money for 
plugging 
we cant hang it up says taylor whose father carried him 
into the oil fields when he was a boy weve either got to plug 
these wells or bond them and get legal if i cant afford to 
produce how am i going to afford to plug 
john ifft oil and gas program manager for the department of 
environmental resources says producers woes are more related to 
price than regulations pennsylvanias laws he says are no more 
stringent than those of other states 
all you have to do is read the newspapers and find out the 
same problems exist in the western states says ifft who used to 
be an independent producer 
not surprisingly environmentalists dont see eye to eye with 
the producers 
oil and gas people create this false issue of environmental 
regulations says mark peterson of the pennsylvania public 
interest coalition a statewide consumer group with 100000 members 
to look at them in one period of time is to really misconstrue 
the business theyre in a boom and bust business and they know it 
full wellthese are big operators they may look small but they 
can still make fantastic sums 
hes watched too much tv counters rhoads the typical small 
operator is a working man who has a family to support and is 
living in the woods and enjoys it hes a momandpop business 
despite their complaints most small operators will stick it 
out rhoads says 
out here in this country youre talking a marginal lifestyle 
for many people there arent a whole lot of employment 
opportunities so you deal in what you knowwhat these people 
know is oil and gas because they were born with it

editors note irving berlin americas bestknown but most 
private songwriter turns 100 this week a diverse group of 
entertainers will take part in a tribute to berlin at carnegie 
hall but dont expect him to attend except for occasional 
strolls berlin stays home talking infrequently with his friends 
by telephone 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
shortly before midnight on may 10 a small group 
of carolers will gather in front of a fivestory brick mansion 
facing the east river on new yorks posh beekman place 
when the clock strikes 12 this impromptu glee club led by 
composer and cabaret performer john wallowitch will break into 
happy birthday followed by a chorus of always 
they will be celebrating at the doorstep of the man who wrote 
that haunting love song irving berlin americas bestknown yet 
most private songwriter turns 100 on may 11 1988 
just mention the melodies berlin wrote and youll start to 
sing white christmas easter parade god bless 
america theres no business like show business 
alexanders ragtime band a pretty girl is like a melody 
puttin on the ritz blue skies how deep is the 
ocean cheek to cheek to name a few 
wallowitchs berlin salute an annual celebration he began more 
than 20 years ago and which he usually holds at 6 pm on christmas 
eve may be the most personal tribute to berlin this year 
they have been devastatingly emotional experiences says 
wallowitch an unabashed berlin fan who lives down the street and 
around the corner from the composer 
but the only festivity officially recognized by the songwriter 
will be a carnegie hall salute on may 11 held in connection with 
ascap the american society of composers authors and publishers 
berlin is a charter member of the organization founded in 1914 
that licenses music for public performance 
the collection of diverse performers expected to appear at the 
gala includes frank sinatra willie nelson jerome robbins walter 
cronkite isaac stern ray charles and garrison keillor it will be 
taped by cbs for a television special later in the month 
dont expect an appearance by the master berlin is passionate 
about his privacy except for short walks around beekman place when 
the weather is warm berlin never is seen in public on his 
infrequent strolls through the tranquil treelined neighborhood 
he usually is accompanied by a young woman or a doorman from a 
nearby building 
call the irving berlin music corp and ask for an interview with 
the boss youll get hilda schneider berlins longtime secretary 
she is polite and friendly but adamant in declining interviews for 
her employer 
im sorry i cant be more encouraging the woman says if 
we do one wed have to do them all its all in the record you 
can look it up 
and the record is pretty impressive some 1500 songs that span 
the worlds of theater movies and popular music no other composer 
can match that record 
for the stage berlin wrote annie get your gun and more than 
a dozen other broadway shows his movies include several fred 
astaireginger rogers classics such as top hat and follow the 
fleet his pop hits those songs not written for any particular 
stage show or film include such standards as remember and 
all alone 
what makes his music so great 
his songs have the sophistication of simplicity says morton 
gould president of ascap you know precisely what hes saying 
and singing hes been able to distill everything down to its 
essence 
he also expresses universal truths gould adds if you 
look at his song titles and listen to his music he expresses 
emotions that human beings would like to experience most people 
want blue skies they want the equivalent of white christmases or 
the whole idea of what easter parade evokes and most of us dont 
want to be all alone by the telephone he says it directly and you 
feel it 
ironically the telephone is how berlin communicates with the 
outside world today when he wants to talk he calls the 
songwriter has a small circle of telephone friends people he dials 
when he has something on his mind gould is one such listener 
he will just call gould says his liaison will say mr 
berlin would like to talk to you when that happens you drop 
everything and pick up the phone its a wonderful thing he has a 
keen mind and hes right on top of everything

another member of this select telephone circle is stanley green 
a musical comedy historian and author of several books about the 
broadway musical green last spoke to berlin when fred astaire died 
last year berlin called green to express his regret about the 
passing of a man he admired very much 
most of berlins contemporaries are dead hes the last of the 
great musical comedy composers a pantheon that once included 
george gershwin jerome kern cole porter and richard rodgers of 
his theater contemporaries only director george abbott who turns 
101 in june survives 
berlin born israel baline in russia came to the united states 
at the age of 2 his family settled on new yorks lower east side 
where as a young boy berlin got jobs singing on the bowery he 
worked as song plugger and a singing waiter at a chinatown cafe it 
was there that he learned to play the piano laboriously picking 
out tunes with one finger this selftaught musician writes the 
same way 
its an incredible catalog this man has achieved with no formal 
education as well as no musical education green says and to 
be able to write music and lyrics 
for all his success berlin is a loner a man very much aware of 
his humble origins his first wife dorothy died from typhoid 
fever less than a year after they were married 
in 1926 berlin married his second wife ellin mackay the 
daughter of a wealthy and socially prominent businessman clarence 
mackay the president of a commercial telegraph company she eloped 
with berlin over her catholic fathers objections and the marriage 
was frontpage news all over the country 
in the more than 60 years they have been married berlin has 
kept his wife and his three daughters out of the public eye 
i think a reason he is so very private is that he is wildly in 
love with his wife wallowitch says i think it is one of the 
greatest romantic love affairs in history 
berlin is the only major songwriter who never had a film 
biography like cole porters night and day george gershwins 
rhapsody in blue sigmund rombergs deep in my heart or 
rodgers and harts words and music 
coupled with his desire for privacy was berlins shrewd business 
instincts in the early 1920s he and two partners built the music 
box theater to showcase his musical revues he and the shubert 
organization still own it 
his music publishing company tightly controls his songs ascap 
wont reveal the amount of money these melodies have generated but 
the man is believed to be a millionaire many times over berlin 
gave the royalties from god bless america to the boy scouts and 
girl scouts of america so far they have earned some 700000 from 
that one song 
berlin withdrew even more from the public eye in 1962 after his 
last broadway musical mr president flopped the show 
starring robert ryan and nanette fabray was a wildly anticipated 
musical generating a record boxoffice advance but tepid reviews 
it had a sixmonth run 
still he came back four years later he wrote a new song an 
old fashioned wedding for the lincoln center revival of annie 
get your gun which starred ethel merman twenty years after the 
original production she stopped the show again with berlins new 
song 
in all his years of serenading berlin wallowitch finally was 
invited into the berlin home nearly five christmas eves ago after a 
chorus of white christmas on an impulse he rang the doorbell 
a maid answered the door and he and his fellow singers were taken 
into the kitchen 
there they were greeted by berlin himself wearing a bathrobe 
and slippers the composer hugged the men kissed the women and 
told them thats the nicest christmas present ive ever had 
every day wallowitch walks his dog winnie around beekman place 
and often wonders what is going on inside the big house now 
i keep holding on to the idea that the man is not allowing 
himself to be bored and is still writing wallowitch says god 
i hope its true

editors note to hear some of them tell it there are more 
witches in north america than you can shake a broom at one of them 
is an american who emigrated to canada a high priest of wicca who 
is campaigning for witches rights among other things he wants a 
license to perform weddings 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
hes a vietnam veteran who spends quiet evenings 
watching cary grant movies and would like to be reincarnated as 
fred astaire 
but charles arnold is also canadas most visible witch a 
seconddegree high priest of wicca the religion of witchcraft 
i dont melt if water is poured over me says the 
40yearold clerical worker who is campaigning for legal acceptance 
of his beliefs in both a male and female divinity the potency of 
magic and absence of original sin 
arnold began the quest last year when he asked his boss for paid 
religious leave on the wiccan holidays of samhain nov 1 when 
witches celebrate the mortality of the body and immortality of the 
soul and belthane may 1 welcoming summer life and fertility 
humber college of applied arts and technology which employs 
arnold in its hospitality office denied his request because wicca 
is not recognized by the canadian council of churches and lacks 
taxfree charitable status 
arnold protested to a labor arbitration board which upheld his 
grievance and said wicca is obviously a religionthe modern 
survival of the ancient pagan religions of western europe 
but arnolds victory was shortlived 
the native of washington dc who served a year in vietnam 
became an antiwar activist and emigrated to canada 15 years ago 
had also applied for a license to become the first canadian witch 
authorized to perform weddings 
in a march ruling the ontario registrargenerals office turned 
him down it questioned the legitimacy of his ordination and the 
nature of the wiccan marriage ritual known as a handfasting 
arnold blamed ontarios protestant establishment although 
council of churches official edith shore showed some sympathy for 
the wiccans christianity was a fringe group when it started 
too she said 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
arnold complained that the marriage act discriminates against 
canadas 5000 witches by making it a crime punishable by up to 
six months in jail to perform an unauthorized wedding 
they should either license me or do away with the law 
altogether he said noting that wiccan weddings are permitted in 
38 us states he had to travel to montpelier vt for his own 
wiccan wedding three years ago 
the practice of witchcraft is fairly widespread in the united 
states but precise numbers are hard to come by 
its everywhere every big city probably has a group says 
the rev w m kent burtner a dominican priest based in portland 
ore who studies cults i see it basically as a nature religion 
not associated with satanism but that may be skewed because of 
whom i get to meet as a catholic priest its a writeyourown 
theology sort of a approach and it runs a real broad spectrum 
lady sabrina a high priestess in nashua nh estimates there 
are a couple of hundred thousand members scattered across the 
united states including a couple of thousand high priests and 
priestesses 
starhawk a san francisco high priestess and author of the 
spiral dance a book about wicca largely agrees 
i just had a conversation with someone and we decided that 
there were between 250000 and 4 million of us she says the 4 
million she explains would include all pagans 
in any case she says there are more of us than there are 
unitarians 
starhawk says many members are underground 
there is a long tradition where it is not safe to be a 
witch she says we dont necessarily announce it many 
peoples jobs would be in jeopardy 
starhawk an author and lecturer teaches at a catholic college 
in oakland calif her most recent book is truth or dare 
encounters with power authority and mystery 
lady sabrina runs our lady of enchantment a wicca mail order 
school with 6000 members representing 25 countries

i have performed marriages and have taxexempt status but i 
only know 12 or 15 others who have tax exemptstatus she says 
you really have to fight to get it 
many of us in california perform marriages but here if you go 
through the trouble to sign the papers and take a blood test you 
can get licensed to perform marriages starhawk says a dog 
could get the license here 
lady sabrina whose church is open to the public on friday 
nights says she never heard of charles arnold but that does not 
surprise her 
for a while a woman in salem mass who was picketing the 
movie witches of eastwick became very well known since there is 
no central organization whoever makes the most noise becomes the 
most prominent witch 
arnold a softspokeman man with a beard says he was initiated 
as a priest in witchcraft traditions dating back thousands of years 
each coven grove or temple chooses its own rituals and vows 
some covens meet in the nude but arnolds group prefers robes 
he offered this description of a wiccan wedding 
inside a magical circle the male and female divinities are 
summoned along with the guardians of the four elements air 
water fire and earth 
the grooms left hand is bound to the brides right hand and 
some choose to draw blood from their skin and touch like blood 
brothers 
couples exchange rings bracelets or floral crowns step over 
flames for purification and fertility and jump over a broom to 
symbolize household unity 
traditional gifts include bread for plenty silver 
prosperity salt health and wood or coal physical and 
emotional warmth 
before the priest pronounces them husband and wife he invokes 
the couple to pleasure one another arnold says we dont cut 
sex off from the rest of life we dont make a big thing out of it 
either 
at the heart of the primitive religion lies the power of the 
male and female in nature symbolized by the god usually referred 
to by the celtic name herne and the goddess known as cerridwen or 
athena or isis arnold said 
wiccans also believe in the mysteries of magic reincarnation 
and in celebrating the rites of passage such as first menstruation 
and menopause 
we go through life after life to learn and evolve and progress 
to the point where we rejoin the god and goddess arnold says 
behind them there is something we cant even identify the unity 
they come from 
witches dont go around laying curses on people and they dont 
conduct human or animal sacrifices eat babies or worship the devil 
as depicted in folklore and comics he said 
but the craft does have a practical side 
i mix up potions and my wife makes some of the finest liqueurs 
youve ever tasted arnold says i use wormwood and calendula 
a rare herb in vinegar to take bruises away and lavender vinegar 
for sunburn 
arnold says he discovered his religion 10 years ago after 
intuitively constructing a wiccan altar in his home a woman he was 
dating happened to be a witch and was startled to see the altar 
leader of the 50member temple of the elder faiths in toronto 
arnold was raised in new jersey by a grandmother who read tea 
leaves 
we believe that if you are meant to find the craft you 
will he says many traditional wiccans think were growing too 
fast and this will water down the religion and may actually destroy 
it 
he said covens usually meet on eight sabbaths coinciding with 
the years solar and lunar cycles the average age in his group is 
27 and members include a real estate agent a schoolteacher and a 
naturopath 
covens are closer than most families members tend to be more 
imaginative than most people and a little bit eccentric said 
arnold a published poet and expert on ritual body decoration

editors note a group of columbus ohio police patrolmen 
formed a rock n roll band about a year ago as a fun way to get 
away from the stress of street duty when the police chief heard 
them play he got the idea of using the band to help combat drug 
abuse since then hot pursuit has been spending a lot of time 
on the road across the northeast 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
theyre just four street cops and a real 
estate agent until they take their guitars keyboard and drums 
before a high school audience then they become hot pursuit a 
rock n roll band with a message 
stay away from drugs 
in just over a year theyve taken that message to high school 
auditoriums and gymnasiums from here to new jersey theyve cut a 
record album appeared on national television performed at a white 
house antidrug conference and have been invited to china 
the band leans heavily on music from the early days of rock n 
roll the 1955 hit jail house rock is their theme song and they 
quickly follow with such numbers as mony mony from 1968 
twist and shout and wipe out 
the five musicians get their kicks watching their young 
audiences 
they dance in the aisles and they come on stage to sing with 
us says columbus patrolman keith ankrom the drummer 
lt karl tresselt who doubles as promoter and manager of the 
band says when you hear the enthusiasm of the kids and how they 
get into the music its all worthwhile 
patrolman richard gillilan bass guitarist and vocalist says 
one thing we want to do is show them that cops are people who 
have a job to do and then they go home to their families and 
bowling leagues like other people 
at first it was just a pickup band organized by columbus 
patrolmen then about a year ago one dropped out and they brought 
in michael finks a real estate agent with a radiotv background 
who works the keyboard and is a backup vocalist 
other members of the band are vocalist randy moon and lead 
guitarist michael wilson pat barr is the sound engineer 
we started as a weekend fun way to get away from the stress of 
street duty tresselt says we just played private parties at 
first 
then police chief dwight joseph happened to hear the band play 
one night 
he said he wanted to see all of us in his office the first 
thing monday and we thought we were in trouble tresselt says 
then he told us the department could use us to go into schools 
with the antidrug message 
from that the bands reputation has grown it played at a 
regional drug conference in cincinnati last fall and then got an 
invitation to perform at the white house conference for a drugfree 
america in february en route home they played at three schools in 
scotch plaines nj a suburb of newark they plan a fourcounty 
swing to schools in michigans upper peninsula in may and have been 
invited back to new jersey 
they also have invitations to play at a july 4 party for the u 
s embassy in beijing and at a national boy scout conference in 
boston on july 16 
weve got the hotel reservations and are trying to get someone 
to underwrite the plane tickets tresselt says 
the band has played a regular schedule of area schools twice a 
week since last nov 1 this year they began making oneday swings 
to other parts of ohio 
gillilan says a hollywood entertainment group has approached 
them about making a twohour pilot movie for television 
just on the sale of the album alone weve raised 12000 for 
the childrens hospital guidance center drug and alcohol program 
gillilan says 
stacks of mail on tresselts desk testify to the reaction from 
students across the state 
after one performance a kid wrote us that he had never thought 
about policemen having families says ankrom percussionist for 
the band he thought we just stayed in uniform and rode in patrol 
cars 24 hours a day 
the band has no budget to speak of and money is a major 
problem they still play for private parties on weekends but most 
of the money earned goes to pay for equipment that tresselt says is 
mostly owned by a bank 
a department store underwrote the trips to cincinnati and 
washington a local automobile dealer has leased the city a band 
equipment truck for 1 a year and the city rented some equipment 
such as strobe lights and smoke machines that allow them to play in 
larger auditoriums 
weve got all kinds of ideas for the band and no money 
gillilan says 
but weve found that the kids are remembering us he added 
two of our guys caught a kid stealing cars on the south end of 
town and all the way to the central station all he talked about was 
hot pursuit and the fact he wasnt on drugs 
and says tresselt the band keeps us off the street

i grew up she said 
she had not wanted to come to excelsior youth centers and was 
more than ready to go home but she said the school finally helped 
her escape the revolving door of juvenile courts and group homes 
she had been stuck in for years in indiana 
excelsior a place for troubled girls perched on the high plains 
southeast of denver consists of a junior and senior high school 
and residential child care facility 
excelsior is one of a few such schools for girls in the country 
and draws students from 17 states 
for many girls the school represents one last chance before 
they are locked up or placed in a hospital 
you have to put up with the girls with their smart mouths and 
their attitudes and their moods says liz not her real name 
but you get the support of the girls too and of the staff and 
the therapist 
she came to excelsior on the recommendation of a caseworker in 
gary ind after five previous placements had failed to improve 
her behavior 
at first i was just really upset because i was getting sent 
away from my family she says then she started working at a 
nearby clothing store saving money making friends and continuing 
to work with a therapist things got better 
they make you deal with your issues you just have to be 
willing to deal with your issues she says 
the issues for excelsiors 130 girls ages 12 to 18 range 
from incest and abuse to murder prostitution and often 
depression 
theres 13yearold jackie found by social service workers in a 
rundown shack in rural wyoming unable to speak after years of 
sexual and emotional abuse when she arrived at excelsior she 
would hoard pieces of metal in her clothes and try to kill herself 
with them school officials said 
theres laura who will stay at excelsior until she recovers 
from the shock of losing two family members to violent deaths and 
tracy who arrived after frequent encounters with the juvenile 
system in los angeles for prostitution and drug abuse 
one of the schools betterknown graduates is deborah jahnke 
the wyoming teenager who was convicted with her younger brother 
richard in the november 1982 shooting death of their abusive 
father deborah jahnkes prison sentence was commuted and she spent 
1 years at excelsior undergoing psychiatric evaluation and 
awaiting court rulings 
these are students they cant educate in the public school 
system kids with severe emotional and behavioral problems who 
would otherwise probably be in a psychiatric hospital says 
excelsior director william c gregory known to the girls as mr 
bill 
when gregory walks through the halls during a typical school 
day he is greeted with hellos and hugs 
in one room a class is making sushi and mr bill is invited to 
test it in another room a chorus of girls is preparing for a 
concert they ask him if hell come to see it 
the cottages where the girls live look out on the rockies they 
resemble college dormitories more than a reform school the girls 
rooms are plastered with posters of animals rock stars the denver 
broncos and inspirational quotations gregory says he can tell how 
well a girl has adjusted by how much she has plastered on her wall

gregory said excelsior girls have had an average of eight 
previous placements in institutions such as psychiatric hospitals 
halfway houses and foster and group homes the majority come out of 
locked institutions 
most referrals to excelsior come from county social workers and 
school districts a few wealthier students are placed privately by 
their parents 
the average stay at the school is 13 months and theres a long 
waiting list 
excelsior a private association run by an 11member board is 
funded mainly by counties which pay a fee for each child placed at 
the school the fee for both treatment and school comes to about 
2700 per month per student which gregory says is cheaper than 
psychiatric hospitalization 
in effect what were doing is taking kids whove been in the 
system for a long time were putting kids out of the system 
while residential childcare facilities are numerous there are 
only about 15 girls schools in the country that offer the broad 
program excelsior does gregory says 
excelsior began its operation here in 1973 and runs on an annual 
budget of 45 million derived from the fees paid by counties and 
from contributions because the state has imposed a threeyear 
freeze on county payments for childcare facilities excelsior has 
been seeking more outofstate students 
it needs more help from the state gregory says with the number 
of disturbed adolescents and teen suicides rising meantime fund 
raising and a bond issue is to finance a new 700000 building that 
will include a 12bed treatment unit 
originally isolated the 33acre campus now is surrounded by 
homes and shopping centers neighbors have never complained about 
the school gregory says 
an accredited junior and senior high school excelsior offers a 
licensed school of cosmetology and fields basketball volleyball 
and softball teams calling themselves the eagles 
it also has a treatment and learning center that can handle 
severely disturbed students gregory says there are three or four 
incidents a month there have been no suicides but weve 
come close 
the schools 170 employees include therapists medical 
personnel teachers and counselors who live with groups of students 
in cottages 
gregory calls the treatment reparenting 
a lot of these kids missed good parenting in their important 
developmental needs he says we dont focus exclusively on the 
psyche we take care of the total child training in hygiene 
social skills 
we as adults are in charge and these types of kids need good 
healthy authority its not a punitive authority but a strong 
nurturing parenting kind of authority 
excelsior also emphasizes family therapy sometimes flying child 
and therapist to the parents home in an effort to get the girl 
back into her family 
gregory says about 85 percent of the girls who leave excelsior 
have completed treatment and are able to function independently 
lizs treatment coordinator murray rodnick says she was 
seriously disturbed and selfdestructive when she came to 
excelsior but the school could reach her by offering an 
incentive to work 
they realize the benefits come from taking responsibility 
he says yes a lot of terrible things have happened in your life 
parental breakups sexual abuse but the bottom line is youre 
responsible for your life now 
a liz decides the payoff is in working not in denying

its been more than 20 years since richard 
chamberlain has starred in a regular television series but he says 
hes about to make a comeback 
not that chamberlain has been a stranger to the tube he has 
been bouncing around the world the past few years filming 
miniseries 
in his latest he costars with jacyln smith in the bourne 
identity based on robert ludlums spy thriller which abc will 
televise in two parts on sunday and monday 
chamberlain is now developing a regular series his first since 
he quit dr kildare in 1966 and took off to england to shed his 
boyish image and become a serious actor 
weve hit on a wonderful idea which i cant talk about he 
says we took the idea to cbs and lorimar and got a deal for 13 
shows 
chamberlain is quite ready to relinquish his title as the king 
of the miniseries and have work that will keep him off the road 
im tired of this gypsy life says chamberlain just back 
from four months in europe filming the ludlum story 
i hadnt anticipated doing another series but i wanted to 
find a way to settle down when you do a series youre at the 
studio all the time but you do get to go home at night 
smith the former charlies angel whos known as the queen 
of the miniseries also doesnt want to travel as much now that 
her children are approaching school age shes looking for a comedy 
series 
about his role in the bourne identity chamberlain says 
jason bourne is a fascinating character very complex very 
divided hes basically a scholar and teacher but he has become 
this terribly efficient undercover agent the story begins when he 
has been shot in the head and washes up on shore in the south of 
france with amnesia 
all he knows is that he has a swiss bank account with 15 
million and everyone is trying to kill him evidence begins to 
build that he is the notorious terrorist carlos he takes jackie 
smith hostage then they fall in love she ends up saving him 
the story like all of those by ludlum is terribly complicated 
but it has been simplified by screenwriter carol sobieski it was 
directed on location by roger young 
theres a lot of mystery about the character chamberlain 
says not only for the audience but for him as well carol has 
taken the story and kept it clear and simple 
filming started last year in nice on the riviera then after a 
christmas break moved to london zurich paris and back to zurich 
we were terrified before starting that zurich would be 30 
below zero chamberlain says but we had an incredible break in 
the weather it was a very warm winter paris was more stunningly 
beautiful than ever 
we had a lot of phone booth scenes because it figures in the 
plot we carried our own phone booth with us we set it up in place 
vendome which is sacred to the french people driving by couldnt 
believe it 
this is a very physical role we had a lot of fights and car 
chases in zurich i rescue marie jaclyn smith from a fate worse 
than death and get beat up in the process we filmed six nights in 
a row in zurich we had so many scenes with a streetcar that we 
rented our own 
before going to europe chamberlain spent six months in new york 
doing blithe spirit on broadway 
most of his projects have kept him away from home he was in 
japan for six months for shogun in yugoslavia three months for 
wallenberg and in africa for eight months for king solomons 
mines 
other projects also took him many places for centennial to 
colorado for three musketeers to england for cook and 
perry to canada and for dream west to arizona the thorn 
birds was the only miniseries filmed here 
hes also developing a new theatrical movie based on the novel 
say goodbye to sam

earle hyman best known for his tv role as bill 
cosbys father says the only place where he is truly recognized as 
a star is in norway a country he loves 
but hyman is pleased with the reception hes getting on broadway 
where he recently took over the role of the chauffeur in the 
pulitzer prizewinning play driving miss daisy 
and he says that playing the part of the chauffeur hoke 
coleman is one of his favorite roles in his 45 years as an actor 
im not leaving unless they fire me says hyman 61 its 
a play that shows pure love coming from the strangest place it is 
the mystery of the human heart 
the play written by alfred uhry and set in atlanta in the years 
from 1948 to 1973 opened in april 1987 hyman followed the 
original hoke coleburn morgan freeman in february frances 
sternhagen had taken over the role of miss daisy from dana ivey in 
january ray gill the only other member of the cast continues to 
play miss daisys son 
frances and i get entrance applause once or twice a week 
hyman says its heartwarming i come from a time in the theater 
when there were stars and we always applauded when they made their 
entrances 
only 287 people a night can be seated in the john houseman 
theater to watch hyman play hoke but hes seen by millions in his 
tv appearances on the cosby show 
his earnings from television enabled hyman to buy a house in 
norway where he frequently appears on the stage 
the only place im a star in the true sense of the word is 
norway he says there they come to see me and hope the play is 
all right im the only foreign actor and only black actor who 
peforms in both norwegian languages 
hyman says that the first time he took a vacation during his 
five years at the american shakespeare festival in stratford 
conn he visited scandinavia he wound up staying the entire three 
weeks in norway the home of his longtime lady friend 
the first time i stepped on that soil i fell in love with 
it he says i felt id been there before 
in norway hyman met the grandson of henrik ibsen the famous 
dramatist who introduced him to theater people 
hyman was born in rocky mount nc his parents both 
schoolteachers moved to brooklyn so their four children could be 
educated in the north 
i was the only black boy in the school he recalls the 
pressure was awful i had nowhere to hide im glad i managed to be 
the best i had a photographic memory id read things twice and i 
knew it 
hymans father became assistant to the city parks commissioner 
and designed the landscaping in prospect park and at the 
planetarium 
its very moving today for me to go look at those trees 
hyman says 
then the depression came along and he was fired he thought it 
was because he was black im sure he was right it hurt him he 
became bitter about it which is worse than being hurt and he kind 
of gave up 
down times came and we moved to poorer and poorer houses and 
apartments it pushed me straight into theater 
on his 13th birthday hyman took his girlfriend to see his first 
professional play ibsens ghosts 
i rushed to the library the next day and read all of ibsens 
plays he says my interest in norway started there i went to 
the theater every week twentyfive cents it cost to sit in the 
second balcony 
he attached himself to mercedes gilbert black who played in 
the green pastures 
i haunted her house hyman says she sort of adopted me 
gave me pointers there were no jobs for black actors 
then a radio producer called the actress one day while hyman was 
there he needed someone to play george washington carver as a boy 
black told hyman then 16 to speak pitching his voice high to 
sound like he was 7 he got the job but the producer was startled 
when in walked a 6foot4 teenager 
hyman added an e to his first name earl and in 1943 was 
offered a walkon part in run little chillun on broadway 
it lasted two weeks but led to his appearance in the american 
negro theaters threes a family 
hyman decided to stay in show business after appearing in the 
american negro theaters anna lucasta this time we came down 
to broadway to stay and stay he says 
driving miss daisy will be made into a movie but hyman 
doesnt think hell get the role because he hasnt done many 
feature films 
i really wish id done more movies he says dore schary 
offered me a featured role in something of value starring rock 
hudson and sidney poitier i turned it down i felt i couldnt do 
it well sometimes in this business it isnt too good to be too 
honest with yourself 
i turned down a few other roles in movies because i love the 
theater so much what snobs we theater actors can be

rick baker is an academy awardwinning makeup 
man but not many stars would ask him for a touchup before facing 
the camera 
well maybe boris karloff or bela lugosi lon chaney would have 
been delighted 
bakers specialty is creating movie monsters he won the first 
annual oscar award for special makeup effects in 1981 for an 
american werewolf in london last month he won a second academy 
award for his makeup work in harry and the hendersons

the something a grotesque alien that comes to earth and begins 
a series of grisly murders 
joe cortese stars as a detective investigating the strange 
deaths maryam dabo costars as a mysterious woman he learns is 
from another planet and is pursuing the creature 
i started with a sketch which i showed to the producer 
said baker in an interview at his glendale studio once we all 
agreed i did a clay mockup 
two assistants hauled out the mockup which was about 4 feet 
long and looked like a mutant scorpion it also has some spider 
features and its back is covered with huge spikes like a dinosaur 
its a space bug baker explained and we call it spike 
because it has so many spikes its able to change appearance and 
take over the body of its victims we constructed a tail section 
thats 12 feet long the creature we built for the movie is much 
nastier looking than this it has a number of fingerlike feelers 
on its face which makes it look like someone stuck a big spider on 
his face 
with looks like that imagine spikes personality it has a 
terrible personality if you can call it that baker said 
its really just a killing machine thats trying to survive 
baker said its much more graphic than whats usually allowed on 
television 
i dont know how much theyll allow on the air he said 
it was difficult to do and keep it acceptable 
at an age when most kids were playing cops and robbers or 
cowboys and indians baker was creating monsters 
i already knew what i wanted to do with my life when i was 
10 he said i was fascinated by frankenstein i wanted to know 
who made it my father was an artist and he taught me a few basic 
things i bought books on sculpting and mold making 
i lived in covina but i had no connection with the movie 
business that made it very difficult to get started i grew up 
working with grease paint putty and making rubber masks 
i was very shy and i found that when i made myself up i could 
things i wouldnt do otherwise also i loved to fool people the 
first time i did a gash on my arm my mother thought i was really 
hurt i did a lot of bloodandgore stuff when i was a kid i 
scared so many people i wasnt allowed in a lot of houses

heads different hands it took 10 months to do the suits with 90

may 3 1968 
it began as any other friday in paris people headed for work 
with no idea that by nightfall blood would be in the streets that 
students would battle police in an insurrection destined to shake 
french society to its roots 
nineteen sixtyeight was a cultural revolution in every sense 
of the word afterward nothing was the same said regis debray 
then a radical and today an adviser to president francois 
mitterrand 
the monthlong series of strikes protests and pitched battles 
nearly brought down the fifth republic of president charles de 
gaulle he resigned the following year 
two decades later historians call may 1968 the greatest popular 
uprising ever experienced by a capitalist democracy in time of 
peace the events of may as they are called still reverberate in 
french minds 
politics schools family life and work art and popular culture 
were transformed may 1968 was a knife blade that severed past from 
future youth from authority then from now 
when the tear gas cleared a new libertarian tolerance was in 
the wind and the twin political pillars of gaullist nationalism and 
communism were permanently fractured 
debray said it was a revolution in the way we live a 
transition from an old rural france where everyone had great 
respect for central authority toward a modern urban france of more 
liberal individualists 
the spasms of unrest in france were part of a common impulse 
felt by a global generation the affluent postwar children who 
from berkeley to berlin focused their anger in protest of us 
involvement in vietnam the former french colony 
today many of these angry young men are leaders of french 
society 
the flashpoint of the events of may was the suburban campus of 
nanterre where protests the preceding march led to the closing of 
the school 
on may 3 about 500 students staged a sitin at the sorbonne 
the old and respected university in paris to protest disciplinary 
action at nanterre by late afternoon masses of riot police had 
surrounded the sorbonne and began making arrests 
students poured from latin quarter cafes with shouts of 
liberez nos camarades free our comrades 
fighting began 
a frantic administration shut down the sorbonne for only the 
second time in 700 years 
a week of shocking violence followed students erected 
barricades of buses felled trees benches and streets signs they 
tore cobblestones from the streets and to hurl at police 
riot police clubbed students and chased them through narrow 
streets sometimes blocking medical help to the injured stinging 
clouds of tear gas shrouded left bank neighborhoods 
by midmay the brutality had swung public opinion behind the 
students 
writer mavis gallant in her recently published diary described 
the morning after a violent clash that injured 367 students 
ripped streets around the luxembourg station people who live 
around here seem dazed paving torn up where i used to 
live looks bombed burned cars ugly grayblack armed men and 
unarmed children we all feel sick 
marc kravetz a leading student figure on the barricades and now 
foreign editor of the newspaper liberation said the burning car is 
the single image of the street fighting that endures in french 
minds 
the car was the symbol of middleclass achievement he said 
and bourgeois values were going up in smoke 
more than a million people formed a river of flags and banners 
pouring down left bank boulevards may 13 and reports of 
demonstrations came from college towns across france 
then something even more astonishing happened 
in a spontaneous wave that swept the nation more than 9 million 
people went on strike 
normal life in paris came to a halt it was impossible to buy a 
newspaper go to school send a letter cash a check ride the bus 
or subway watch television or take a train frightened people who 
remembered world war ii began hoarding cigarettes sugar and 
canned goods 
the difference between the strikes at columbia university in 
manhattan and the sorbonne in paris was that the rest of new york 
city barely noticed what was happening uptown at columbia paris 
was paralyzed 
garbage piled up in the streets teachers stopped teaching 
actors stopped acting the odeon theatre was occupied by students 
and workers holding marathon debates on creating a new society 
even rugby players went on strike

<TEXT>
the strikes marked the beginning of the end for the communist 
party which sabotaged the student movement believing it an 
uncontrollable revolt of spoiled middleclass kids but that 
attitude permanently alienated intellectuals and youth and 
contributed to the eventual election of socialist president 
mitterrand 
more significantly french politics had to deal with a new force 
the media young people came to view television radio and 
newspapers as not just reporters of events but tools for the 
creation of events 
debray said one such creation was daniel cohnbendit the best 
known of the radical student leaders called danny the red because 
of his rusty hair and provocative style 
it was not cohnbendit who organized the rallies or did the 
concrete work debray said but he was the one the television 
cameras loved so whether he wanted to or not he became a major 
leader of the movement 
nineteen sixtyeight was the beginning of the medias conquest 
of french politics and life 
young people realized that all they needed was not a place in 
the french cabinet to be effective but two minutes on the evening 
news 
we stopped thinking in terms of traditional politics said 
historian herve hamon once a student on the barricades and now 
author of a history of the 1968 generation 
hamon said as his peers grew older they indeed rejected 
politics to pursue careers in medicine teaching the arts and 
above all journalism 
cohnbendit born in france of german parents now publishes a 
current affairs magazine in frankfurt west germany at 43 he 
still lives the life of a freelance radical writing books and 
working with west germanys antiestablishment greens party 
i believe i can still legitimize everything i do from my 
standpoint in 1968 cohnbendit said in an interview with the 
associated press adding that events 20 years ago irrevocably 
changed morality sexuality and french education 
alain peyrefitte who as de gaulles education minister in 1968 
considered cohnbendit a troublemaker now agrees with his 
assessment of the events 
i was against the movement and felt it was my duty to limit it 
at the time but i recognize that in the longterm the effects were 
good said peyrefitte now head of the editorial board for the 
conservative newspaper le figaro people became more responsible 
for their lives gained more dignity and felt more free 
on may 30 de gaulle made a longawaited radio speech 
reassuring french citizens who were fed up with upheaval that the 
government was in control hours later millions of frenchmen 
jammed the place de la concorde waving the french flag the nation 
cooled down as abruptly as it caught fire 
under de gaulle a series of reforms came in late 1968 to 
decrease the number of students in a classroom increase personal 
contact between students and professors and decentralize the 
control of schools 
nineteen sixtyeight opened the door for the french feminist 
movement in the 1970s and the introduction of legal reforms 
governing abortion and contraception relationships between men and 
women changed 
the students of the barricades now are graying parents and 
relationships between these fathers and sons are less formal more 
tolerant 
in the marches of 68 you never saw any parents said 
kravetz in 1986 in the demonstrations against the education 
reforms parents marched beside their kids there is greater 
communication between the generations now 
to understand what 1968 meant to us you would have to have 
seen what we were like before

germany isnt a land of 
immigration government officials like to say 
but a massive influx of turks and other foreigners has changed 
the face of this once insular nation 
from dozens of kebab stands in big cities to young turkish 
children playing in rural towns the foreigners are making their 
presence felt 
nearly 15 million turks live in west germany the largest group 
among the 45 million foreigners in a country with a total 
population of 613 million frankfurt has a turkish bazaar 
yugoslavs number about 590000 and italians are the 
thirdlargest with about 535000 
one of the turks is nedzhati baris who has acquired a small but 
successful business and an expensive home in the affluent town of 
koenigstein outside frankfurt 
my position here now is quite good he said in german at his 
store we are well known since weve been here a long time 
the only worry is bringing my mother for a visit from turkey 
weve been waiting eight months for a visa 
the immigrant workers began arriving in the 1960s and 1970s and 
were called gastarbeiter german for guest workers to signify what 
was to have been a temporary stay 
now most of the turks are still work on assembly lines or at 
menial jobs shunned by west germans 
journalist guenther wallraffs 1985 book on the exploitation of 
turkish workers ganz unten rock bottom became a bestseller 
and stirred controversy and soulsearching among west germans 
federal and state authorities are trying to reduce the number of 
foreigners in the country and make it more difficult for them to 
bring in family members 
but opposition groups say west germanys economy one of the 
worlds strongest will need even more foreign workers in the 
future as the german birth rate continues to drop 
although most turks hold lowpaid jobs some of them are 
successful businessmen turkishowned travel agencies specializing 
in trips to their homeland are mushrooming across the country 
cashing in on the west germans growing interest in turkey 
turks nevertheless have been physically attacked by west 
german extremist groups and they face other problems 
according to all our studies the turks by far have the most 
difficult time integrating into the german society said hartmut 
reichow an expert in the federal office for foreigners in bonn 
this has to do with their background they have a different 
religion islam and come from a totally different culture 
reichow said in an interview 
but the situation is much better now than it was in the late 
1960s then very few turkish children went to school now more 
and more and are getting even higher education and their prospects 
look much brighter 
two high schools in gelsenkirchen a ruhr valley industrial 
city recently became the first in west germany to offer the 
turkish language as one of the subjects for the abitur the 
examination that gives successful candidates a diploma roughly 
equal to a junior college degree in the united states 
the schools whose student bodies are about a quarter turkish or 
turkishborn were the first to apply a longexisting law allowing 
a foreign language to be one of the subjects in the final exam 
turks are also making their mark on cultural life 
the turkishborn director tevfik baser scored a hit two years 
ago with his movie 40 square meters germany a moving story 
about a the wife of a turkish worker forced by her husband never to 
leave their tiny apartment in hamburg 
the leading role was played by ozay fecht who came to west 
germany from istanbul when she was 18 and became a critically 
acclaimed actress and jazz singer 
another turk saliha scheinhardt who married a west german 
advanced from a textile factory worker waitress and air hostess to 
prizewinning author writing mostly in german 
but it is the service sector where turks and other foreigners 
are beginning to play dominant roles 
they run neighborhood ethnic restaurants and groceries as well 
as tailor and shoerepair shops 
istanbul kebab balkan grill and italian pizza are 
found not only in large cities but also in many villages across 
west germany

in koenigstein a halfhours drive northwest of frankfurt 
grocer baris explained that 15 years ago he traded his ice cream 
parlor at adana in the southern turkey for an uncertain future in

some beer fanciers have brushed off as a 
passing fancy the popularity of corona extra the biggestselling 
mexican beer in the united states 
market experts questioned whether the light lager could compete 
in an import market traditionally dominated by darker and heavier 
european brews 
not so valentin diez of cervecerias modelo the makers of 
corona under his guidance as modelos general sales director 
corona has vaulted into second place among imported beers in the 
united states and the company is aiming to be no 1 
in the process grupo modelo the brewerys parent company is 
exemplifying president miguel de la madrids controversial effort 
to wean mexican industry off years of subsidies and trade 
protection to create an exportdriven economy that can successfully 
compete abroad 
we want to be a model for all mexican businesses by giving 
prestige and credibility to mexican products abroad diez said at 
his mexico city headquarters 
a growing number of american beer drinkers are convinced 
americans consumed 25 million cases of corona extra last year 
more than double the 1986 figure and 10 times above that just six 
years ago 
corona captured 18 percent of the us import market in 1987 
second only to heineken of the netherlands with 25 percent 
according to impact international a new yorkbased publication 
that monitors the beer industry 
and with corona now available in only 36 states grupo modelo 
directors have reason to believe theyll achieve their goal 
diez cited strict quality control strong advertising and sound 
marketing as reasons for coronas export success but it has been 
sound financial planning at home that has steered modelo through 
mexicos economic crisis 
tight credit rising costs slack consumer demand and crushing 
private debts have hurt many mexican businesses including modelos 
chief competitor cuauhtemoc of monterrey 
modelo avoided these pitfalls by refusing to borrow to finance 
investment when borrowing from foreign lenders was the rage in the 
late 1970s and early 1980s the company continuously plowed its 
earnings back into the firm 
grupo modelos policy always has been to grow using its own 
resources that means no debts diez said we did it by 
reinvesting all of our dividends over the years to construct our 
own breweries malt and glass producing firms our own warehouses 
and distributors 
many at the time thought we were wrong but this policy has 
allowed us to consolidate our leadership position in the mexican 
beer industry 
modelo brands now account for nearly half the mexican market and 
60 percent of all mexican beer exports diez said 
corona has been available in western us states since 1966 but 
sales growth was limited because a puerto rican brewery owned the 
us rights to the familiar corona blueandwhite crown trademark 
cervecerias modelo was able to arrange a concurrent use 
agreement in 1983 and bought the trademark two years later 
with the trademark question out of the way this allowed us to 
launch ourselves into the market diez said 
not quite 
modelos governing board insisted on introducing the lager into 
the us market on a gradual basis rather than trying to flood it 
all at once 
corona showed up first in restaurants and bars before it 
appeared in liquor stores and supermarkets the beer became 
identified with trendy establishments and ethnic cuisine 
they dont want to just open a market said roberto viejo a 
sales director at modelo they work it service it it isnt 
just hey heres a new brand no way 
coronas popularity has benefited from a slick advertising 
campaign with its cross the border message linking the lager 
to mexican tourist attractions in magazines and on billboards 
in mexico modelo has pushed its premium beer at sporting 
events the beers logo is found everywhere inside mexico citys 
social security park home to the citys red devils and tigers 
professional baseball teams and at boxing arenas 
the sports angle is being developed in the united states as 
well a promotional stint during the week of the ncaa college 
basketball championships featured six corona bottles two of them 
empty and the slogan on to the final four 
a us commerce department decision to revoke trade preferences 
for mexican beer in 1987 didnt hurt coronas sales growth 
instead the company judged it a sign that the brew could 
successfully compete on equal terms with other american imports 
so has president de la madrids administration which cited 
cervecerias modelo for export achievements and diezs colleagues 
in the mexican association of sales and marketing executives 
designated him their distinguished executive of the year in 1987 
increased competitiveness means facing the prospect of more 
imported beers in mexico as well a trade agreement signed with the 
united states last year will allow many american beers in mexico 
for the first time 
diez is confident modelo will rise to the challenge 
we welcome them having plain confidence that the quality of 
our beers will allow us to freely compete with the best beers in 
the world he said 
with new markets opening up in new york new jersey alabama and 
the carolinas this year diez predicts corona sales will jump an 
additional 15 percent 
the company hopes its other leading export brands negra modelo 
modelo especial and pacifico also will catch on with american beer 
drinkers 
corona is making inroads in other countries the lager was 
recently introduced in japan and after just one year it is the 
thirdleading import by volume in canada 
distributors in france spain belgium australia and south 
korea have expressed interest in corona diez said 
viejo the sales director dismissed some experts opinion that 
corona may already be falling out of the trendy import category in 
the american market 
i wouldnt worry about it as long as they keep talking about 
it he said corona is not in or out its a mainstream brand 
corona did fall into the list of outs for beers in 
businessweek magazines trends list for 1988 
the brew that took its place in the in column negra modelo

no one is better qualified than blake edwards to create a movie 
about the early days of hollywood he is a thirdgeneration 
filmmaker his grandfather was a silent film director his father 
was an assistant director and production manager his daughter 
jennifer a promising actress makes it four generations 
the latest movie from the prolific edwards breakfast at 
tiffanys the great race 10 is sunset an 
affectionate funny exhilarating glimpse at what hollywood in the 
1920s might have been give or take one or two lies as one of 
the characters explains 
based on a book by rod amateau edwards script contains a 
delicious idea the teaming of wyatt earp and tom mix to solve a 
hollywood murder case the juxtaposition of an authentic western 
hero and a gaudy star of horse operas makes a splendid metaphor 
and edwards adds another element from movie lore the bootlegging 
mafia 
the plotting of sunset becomes a bit convoluted for easy 
comprehension and the heroics grow farfetched but the movie 
rolls along with edwards faultless pacing and most of all by the 
inspired casting of james garner and bruce willis they are the 
slickest screen pairing since paul newman and robert redford 
the two mythic heroes are brought together when earp comes to 
hollywood as technical adviser for a movie in which he will be 
portrayed by mix after an early antagonism the pair develop a 
mutual respect and visit a luxurious hollywood brothel 
when one of the leading ladies of the evening turns up dead 
earp and mix are plunged into a web of intrigue that leads to the 
doorstep of studio head alfie alperin malcolm mcdowell once a 
silent movie clown blake edwards who has a long history of 
battles with studio bosses must have delighted in making one one 
of the villains of sunset 
the story involves a wide range of characters including the 
dead womans daughter mariel hemingway a crooked cop richard 
bradford the oily studio police chief m emmet walsh and an 
underworld lord joe dallesandro they interweave sometimes 
confusingly but most of the elements unweave at the end 
garner is a marvel to watch his quiet authority dominating 
every scene but willis also shows his best bigscreen form yet 
capturing the flamboyance of mix as well as his selfmockery 
the tristar pictures release was produced by tony adams the 
rating is r for language and sexual content running time 101

119minute film directed by brian de palma and written by david

deniros capone is a a boss who keeps his troops in line with 
batwielding brutality he jokes with reporters bribes the legal 
system and cries at the opera at the same time hes being told of a 
successful killing 
sean connery won an academy award as best supporting actor for 
his role as an honest cop who joins ness he offers this harsh 
advice on how to beat capone he pulls a knife you pull a gun 
he sends one of yours to the hospital you send one of his to the 
morgue thats the chicago way 
fashions by giorgio armani enhance the films stylishness 
it has an rrating for language and graphic violence including

george gershwin rhapsody in blue concerto in f william 
tritt piano the cincinnati pops orchestra erich kunzel 
conducting 
 
the popularity of george gershwins rhapsody in blue owes a 
lot to the orchestration prepared by ferde grofe in 1942 but there 
was an earlier version also grofes work for paul whitemans 
experiment in modern music at the aeolian hall in new york in 
1924 
this was the version and this was the concert that established 
rhapsody in blue as an american standard 
whiteman commissioned gershwin on the strength of the composers 
broadway successes notably swanee for al jolson in 1920 
setting to work just a month before the concert gershwin wrote 
a solo piano part and a second piano part which represented the 
orchestra grofe then helped in orchestrating the piece for eight 
violins double bass three woodwinds two horns two trombones 
tuba tympani banjo celeste percussion and piano 
it is this orchestration which the cincinnati pops orchestra has 
recreated using 24 players in the guise of the cincinnati jazz 
orchestra 
its a beguiling performance despite the digital clarity the 
small forces evoke the sound of old 78 rpm recordings and those 
makebelieve ballrooms of the early days of radio 
delightful though it is the recording also affirms the 
rightness of the more familiar 1942 version in its final bars 
rhapsody begs for more oomph than two dozen players can muster 
the concerto in f variations on i got rhythm and the 
rialto ripples rag performed by the full pops orchestra round 
out a very satisfying hourplus compact disc

pinker and prouder than previous columbia nick lowe 
 
forgive nick lowe for feeling a little baffled about what the 
general public wants in its music stars 
this veteran british rocker has done everything but jump through 
hoops in an attempt to break through during the past few years he 
released two solid albums including the exceptional rose of 
england after a string of inferior early 1980s records he 
rerecorded one of his best songs i knew the bride with huey 
lewis and the news 
still no luck the back cover of his new album pinker and 
prouder than previous shows lowe standing against a brick wall 
gazing wistfully at a street sign called market place 
the relaxed tone of pinker suggests lowe has thrown up his 
hands and just decided to do whats comfortable while the results 
are a few notches below his last two records pinker has its 
moments 
lowes a rock n roller as he constantly tried to reassure 
fans who saw him on a solo acoustic tour last year but he takes a 
few intriguing left turns at the outset of this record youre my 
wildest dream is a roadhouse blues number backed by the fabulous 
thunderbirds and crying in my sleep is a rare ballad 
he cajoles two fine contributions from friends who happen to be 
sterling songwriters love gets strange is a john hiatt 
throwaway for which many songwriters would kill and black 
lincoln continental by graham parker is a rollicking good time 
yet whats designed as this albums showcase is oddly 
disappointing lowe briefly reunites with former rockpile partner 
dave edmunds with whom he spent much of the 1980s feuding but the 
reunion is only for one song and instead of complementing the 
album lovers jamboree stands uncomfortably apart 
one hopes the slightly disjointed feel of this record doesnt 
herald a return to lowes early 80s sloppiness hes too much fun 
even when not at his best to lose heart over a lack of commercial 
success

once a reluctant member of the muchmaligned 
brat pack demi moore has graduated to become a star in her own 
right a budding producer wife of bruce willis of tvs 
moonlighting fame and a future mother 
these dizzying changes have somehow left the actress more serene 
than ever during a recent interview at tristar pictures where 
she occupies offices for development of screen projects she seemed 
calm and controlled a 25yearold confident of the future 
moore currently stars in the seventh sign as a pregnant wife 
who is the central figure in a presentday threat of a biblical 
apocalypse the film has received a cool response from reviewers 
and the public 
a lot of people have commented that it might be in that genre 
of films such as rosemarys baby and the omen she said i 
dont think we set out for it to be that type of film when i read 
the script the story always had an uplifting message whereas 
those other films always dealt with the devil and the concept of an 
outside evil force coming in and taking over 
for me the only evil force in the movie is the human race and 
what were doing to ourselves 
its the first time ive had to carry a movie and on that 
level it was more challenging she said also its a different 
character and the subject matter was much weightier ive always 
been associated with light romantic comedies 
moore said some of her roles in such movies as about last 
night and st elmos fire had moments of emotional depth 
that had to be reached particularly about last night exposed 
that i was capable of more than just a frivolous lookinggood 
character 
tristar thought so and she is now developing a film project 
based on a book she discovered you just cant be at the studios 
mercy to bring you that ideal role she said 
moore whose parents spotted the name demi in a fashion 
magazine had an unsettled childhood she attended 30 different 
schools as her advertising manager father moved to various 
newspapers of a large chain her childhood curiously parallels 
those of other young stars such as tom cruise and rebecca de mornay 
that experience definitely has something to do with how i 
ended up here moore said when you move around a lot youre 
always having to adjust and fit in meet people and situations 
ive talked to a number of people who have had similar 
experiences rebecca being one i dont quite know what it is 
maybe its just being able to adjust fit in cope create whatever 
you need to survive make it work 
there are two choices you can become introverted isolated 
and alone or you can become extroverted and put yourself out there 
and try to fit into the group so youre not alone i dont think 
that always leaves you with a great sense of yourself or of 
security 
moore chose to be extroverted and at 16 she dropped out of 
school to become a model she had the flawless beauty but at 5 
feet5 inches not the height so she took acting classes and at 
18 landed the role of jackie templeton on the tv soap general 
hospital her first major film role was in blame it on rio 
in which she appeared topless as michael caines headstrong 
daughter 
more films followed no small affair st elmos fire 
one crazy summer wisdom in the latter she costarred 
with emilio estevez who was then her fiance last nov 21 she 
married bruce willis in las vegas nev she said their baby is due 
in late summer 
moore was well prepared for her pregnancy to research the 
seventh sign she talked to pregnant women and obstetricians and 
visited delivery rooms 
it was a lot of fun for me she said i had a leotard suit 
with a belly that weighed 10 to 15 pounds i wore it for two weeks 
before the film started to get the feeling the walk people 
responded to me differently 
i also had a prosthetic device which was sculpted of rubber 
and took six hours to apply gluing it to my skin thank god i only 
had to wear it four or five times 
for me it is much more exciting that i got to play pregnant 
and make it so realistic and now to have the real thing happen

shes a bird shes a maid shes a flirtatious 
landowner shes a kid sister 
shes dawn upshaw supersoprano and during the final weeks of 
the metropolitan opera season her sweet lyric voice seemed to be 
piping up all over the place 
if anybody had told me i was going to be doing what i did this 
season id have been flabbergasted miss upshaw said in a recent 
interview it was very draining 
what she did within the space of two months was sing the 
offstage role of the forest bird in wagners siegfried the 
comic housemaid despina in mozarts cosi fan tutte adina the 
heroine of donizettis the elixir of love and sophie the 
younger sister of charlotte in massenets werther 
its not something i would want to do very often so many 
different things all at once she said the preparation was not 
the problem it was more concentration 
the centerpiece of all this activity was four performances as 
adina by far the biggest role the 27yearold soprano has sung at 
the met and one she almost didnt sing at all 
i was the cover understudy for kathy battle and supposed to 
be singing the smaller role of giannetta she said the night 
of the first performance i was on my way out the door at 10 to 7 
when i got the call saying kathy was sick and could i please go on 
as adina 
the same question had been put to her last fall when illness 
forced judith blegen to cancel a run of adinas 
they gave me a choice of going on but it was a new role a 
new style for me she said i thought no id better wait 
they were very nice they didnt pressure me to rush in 
in february miss upshaw decided she was ready and the critics 
agreed 
the result was a highly successful charming performance as 
might have been expected from one of the most critically admired 
singers of her generation wrote john rockell of the new york 
times 
she drew equal praise for the other roles she sang in her 
lateseason burst as sophie declared the aps mary campbell she 
displayed a voice as fresh as spring as despina said times 
critic will crutchfield she was a joy to the ear 
despina put her in the midst of a backstage drama that miss 
upshaw would just as soon forget the korean soprano heikjung hong 
another budding met star at age 29 had been scheduled to sing 
the opening performance however according to some accounts the 
evenings star soprano kiri te kanawa expressed displeasure and 
demanded that she not join the cast until the second performance 
all i know is someone i know there called and asked me 
could you come in we dont think heikjungs quite ready for the 
first performance miss upshaw said its not something id 
care to discuss with heikjung our friendship is just as it was 
before this didnt have anything to do with the two of us 
though this was miss upshaws fourth season at the met most of 
her previous appearances were in tiny roles starting with a debut 
as the countess ceprano in verdis rigoletto 
i think i had two lines she recalled 
verdi is not a composer of whose works she expects to sing a 
lot miss upshaw describes herself as a lyric soprano but the 
quality is not strictly soubrette meaning she is wellsuited for 
parts more substantial than the traditional comic maid 
but my voice is not heavy enough for puccini not even mimi 
in la boheme she said 
there was a time when miss upshaw who grew up in the chicago 
suburb of park forest had her sights set no higher than singing 
jingles in tv commercials 
while i was in high school i worked as a secretary for a 
jingle producer she said i thought this looks good people 
come in sing for five minutes go home and thats how they make 
their living 
her plan was to study singing in college and become an expert 
sightreader a requirement for professional jingling but when she 
went to illinois wesleyan university she discovered the world of 
classical music and began to think of a somewhat loftier career 
david nott her voice teacher at wesleyan and the schools 
choral director encouraged her to attend the manhattan school of 
music in new york after she graduated there she studied with ellen 
faull a former opera singer and highly respected teacher 
during the summers she made the rounds of american music 
festivals such as aspen and tanglewood studying with established 
singers and developing a reputation of her own as an upandcomer 
she also attracted the attention of the met which put her into its 
informal internship program for young artists 
like many singers of my age i didnt have to work for years 
in europe before being accepted here miss upshaw said i think 
maybe americans are becoming very proud of our own singers 
next years met schedule calls for her to be just as busy as 
this season but itll be more spread out shell repeat the 
forest bird sophie and giannetta and also sing ilia in mozarts 
idomeneo down the road she will be zerlina when the met 
stages its longawaited new production of mozarts don giovanni 
when not singing at the met miss upshaw who makes her home in 
new york with her musicologist husband keeps busy performing solo 
recitals and singing at major european summer festivals including 
salzburg and aixenprovence

and the songs he did were novelties and saloon tunes with witty 
anecdotes 
he played at a club called tramps with his fivepiece banshees 
of blue and moved to the bottom line with his 11piece banshees of 
blue then he went national saturday night live snapped him 
up he was interviewed on the tonight show starring johnny 
carson signed for miami vice and appeared in ads for 
amaretto liqueur 
his new album for rca buster poindexter has been on 
bestselling charts for months hot hot hot a tune he once 
heard on a caribbean vacation sung by a calypso king named arrow 
was the first single his newest single also borrowed is oh me 
oh my which was recorded in 1925 by the new orleans owls 
and buster poindexter is playing dates in much nicer rooms than 
david johansen ever did 
i like places where your feet dont stick to the floor he 
said until i had the album there was no going out as buster 
poindexter people wouldnt come you can have the greatest show on 
earth but if they havent heard of you theyre not going to come 
out and see you 
the 38yearold johansen explained the reasons for his new 
persona id been doing a straight rock n roll show for many 
years and i got tired of it i think i outgrew it i wanted to do 
something a little more sophisticated and something i could 
entertain people of all ages with instead of just kids 
as solo performer david johansen after the 197375 new york 
dolls heyday a lot of things i would say were going over the 
audiences heads now im in a situation where i can be funny it 
is very satisfying 
every year youre singing rock you get older but the kids stay 
the same age buster is suitable entertainment for all ages people 
who like rock like buster 
he chose the obscurities from days gone by for the album 
the reason i started doing buster poindexter was i wanted to 
sing all these songs ive cataloged in my head it wasnt like 
i seriously expected to do this 
i didnt stop doing the other thing and start doing this i 
started monday nights at tramps i said i was buster poindexter so 
they wouldnt come expecting to see david johansens schtick for 
six months maybe i was singing as both it was a natural 
progression now guys on the street go yo buster 
johansen is married to portrait photographer kate simon 
he started in show business in the campy gay theater troupe 
charles ludlums ridiculous theater and moved on to become lead 
singer in a campy male rock group the new york dolls who wore 
high heels and makeup 
i guess i was a precocious kid he said in an interview 
most of the people in my family sing dance are always in plays 
i was the least inclined in that direction im the one who took it 
up as a profession now my mother comes to my shows all the time 
with her friends 
his norwegian father who died three years ago was a light 
opera singer who became an insurance salesman when he and his irish 
wife had the first of their six children we always went to see 
broadway shows when we were kids johansen said i liked them 
all 
at home on staten island david johansens street name was 
buster 
i was the one in the gang who read books he says they 
called me poindexter some people have that wanderlust both 
physically and intellectually i had a band in high school the 
blue banshees i wanted to revive that name for whatever reason 
im not sure 
after high school he worked for people who owned a store one 
of them was in the late charles ludlums theater company i just 
kind of fell into it charles ludlum was a brilliant man very 
generous with his information i learned a lot it was like an 
apprenticeship i was a lion in one play a saint in one i was an 
extra really 
then i started up the new york dolls at that time rock was 
very blue jeans and flannel shirts we wanted to bring a sense of 
flamboyance fantasy and fun to it the way we dressed scared the 
homophobes people afraid of homosexuals 
we got involved with each other because we looked like that 
i dont think we thought what we were doing was particularly 
outrageous i think it translated that way we made two albums for 
mercury released many times the best of very best of complete 
works of 
it has been said the new york dolls were the beginning of 
punk i dont agree i think it was classic rock n roll we 
played i wrote lyrics that were teen angst with a sense of humor 
johansen said the new york dolls broke up because they got tired 
of each other we were very volatile wed have an argument that 
would be it most people would say we still have this viable 
gig not us we were amateur i guess 
in retrospect it was a project that was completed i dont 
want to go around looking like that forever i see grown men still 
wearing their mothers clothes i say there but for the grace go 
i 
after the breakup johansen and another band member made money 
touring japan johansen now calls them the dollettes then he 
wrote songs and made six solo albums for epic continually touring 
the united states for eight years 
i love to sing he says its the schlep that kills me

eric hansen has vivid memories of the split second 
it took to make the decision turn his back on civilization and 
return to the borneo jungle he had just spent five months crossing 
on foot 
six years after his marathon trip other memories continue to 
haunt hansen who relates his experiences in his new book 
stranger in the forest on foot across borneo houghton 
mifflin co 1795 
he recalls his brush with death with former headhunters 
convinced he was an evil spirit and his fantasies about 
crosscountry skiing while trudging through the hot leech and 
insectinfested rain forest 
departing from kuching in the west in may 1982 hansen made a 
2500mile journey through uncharted rain forest to tanjungselor in 
the east and back carrying only a bed sheet a change of clothes 
and barter goods 
he had the company of guides for much of the time but also 
traveled alone he emerged a changed man a spearwielding hunter 
and a gatherer whose western sense of time had washed away 
after spending five months in the jungle i wasnt fully aware 
of how much i had changed hansen said then i went back two 
more months and i had changed even more 
in singapore his first real exposure to civilization 
afterwards there was all this traffic and the pollution and 
i was acutely aware of the fact that there were no trees at all 
and i felt much more uncomfortable coming back into western society 
than i had going into the jungle 
civilization lost its terrors within about two months for the 
author but longterm changes remain to this day 
im much more patient much more resilient its very much 
developed my selfconfidence he said in a recent interview 
the borneo journey was not the first adventure for the 
40yearold los angeles native who has traveled to nepal and 
northern afghanistan he also has worked as a goldsmith a buffalo 
catcher and as a barber for mother teresas home for the destitute 
in calcutta 
like his other experiences hansen said that the decision to 
embark on a rain forest odyssey was compulsive 
i think a lot of us fantasized about a place we want to go or 
a situation we would like to be in and most of us are quite happy 
to keep it on that fantasy level he said i thought about 
going to borneo for five or six years and it became an overwhelming 
desire on my part 
hansens 278page book is at its most fascinating when it 
juxtaposes civilization against the rain forest and its creatures 
the author among them among such vignettes is an episode 
describing the aftermath of a wild boar hunt with parangs heavy 
knives 
squatting on my haunches i could feel the fat running down my 
forearms and dripping from my elbows i was totally absorbed in the 
meal when i heard a vaguely familiar droning sound growing louder 
and louder 
i looked up through a gap in the jungle canopy and saw for 
perhaps five seconds a commercial airliner 
i imagined myself sitting on the plane far below at the 
edge of a small clearing almost hidden from sight i could see 
myself seated by a campfire with two brownskinned jungle men 
speaking an unknown language nearby lay the steaming carcass of a 
wild boar 
from that perspective i suddenly realized what an astonishing 
situation i was in submerged in a sea of giant trees hunting wild 
animals a bloodied parang at my waist the stuff of pure fantasy 
six months earlier 
hansens encounter with american missionaries and his decision 
to retrace his steps is perhaps the keystone episode and clearly 
explains the triteness of civilization to a man grown 
accustomed to harsher realities 
ian and julie were perched nervously on the edge of their 
seats staring at me perhaps waiting for me to disappear i looked 
at the christian paintings calendars and framed scriptural quotes 
that covered the walls i had been in the jungle too long to make 
any sense of them 
all these symbols seemed trite and out of place and their 
puppy that sweetsmelling freshly shampooed little bundle of 
white fluff would have been torn to pieces in thirty seconds by the 
village hunting dogs 
hansen chuckled as he thought back to that time 
they had this little bungalow beside the jungle and inside the 
house was a perfect time capsule he said everything about it 
was ridiculous from the soap to the rugs to the cookies in a jar 
i was convinced that it had been brought by helicopter and just 
dropped there 
in the book he presents the forest and its inhabitants at their 
most frightening on his return trip when he ignored the locals 
advice and embarks alone during the season of fear the former 
time for headhunting when evil spirits lurk 
hansen was mistaken for a bali saleng half man half 
spirit who kills for blood and who cannot be killed 
what i did not know was that the description of bali saleng 
changed regularly he writes at the time the description 
was a tall whiteskinned man with brownish hair who walks by 
himself in the jungle 
his book describes several close calls with frightened natives 
including one hairraising encounter where he was stripped and 
crossexamined for hours until he laboriously convinced his 
interrogators to let him free 
hansen said his journey left him none the worse for wear and 
that he is looking forward to his next project an extended tour 
of rugged north yemen 
the slightly built balding adventurer laughed heartily when 
told that he did not seem physically rugged enough for such 
experiences 
i think theres a myth fed by movies and television that its 
the hairychested gunslinging whipwielding individual that 
conquers the mountain or the river or the woman or whatever he 
said 
in fact ive never seen anyone in real life like that get 
very far because theyre the first ones to get sick or 
complain or freak out when something happens 
when they cant scream or pay somebody off they give up

legendary disc jockey wolfman jack says 
his new cable tv show spotlighting the golden era of rock n roll 
rivals his old hit show the midnight special 
the wolfman who portrayed himself in the 1973 movie american 
graffiti is the host of rock n roll palace on the 
nashville network the 30minute program is taped at little 
darlins rock n roll palace in kissimmee fla 
the bearded host says he does not missing doing the midnight 
special of which he was host for eight years because the new 
program is so good 
we have very special and wonderful people the 49yearold 
wolfman said in an interview we had a magic and it comes out on 
the tube the show comes on and goes off fast everyone was 
inspired and wanted to be there and wanted to perform it was very 
magical 
guests this season include the diamonds the shirelles tommy 
sands the coasters del shannon brian hyland joey dee lou 
christie the crystals bobby vee martha reeves mary wells 
johnny tillotson the platters the crickets lenny welch freddie 
cannon spencer davis billy j kramer and the tokens 
on tv theres not one show going after these acts the 
wolfman said this is the first show to come along and do this 
its real american music what rock n roll originally was 
before people turned it around and sideways and upside down from 
1958 to 1964 thats real rock n roll then the beatles hit and 
everyone sounded like them they didnt give our boys long enough 
there were real classics from that era 
the feeling of some of the music today is a little bit like 
that era but the purity of rock n roll when it first came out 
was astounding she said it was pure simple nothing heavy 
nothing but fun and romance it had a good beat and you could dance 
to it there were great ballads in those days 
the wolfman who has a syndicated radio show on about 70 
stations said music today emphasizes the performer rather than the 
song 
you dont go see michael jackson for the song but for his 
great entertaining and dancing you see a 2 million show in the 
old days you paid 23 and saw 18 acts back then everyone 
worked together you try to put 18 acts together today and see what 
it costs you 
the wolfman said he has many fond memories of the midnight 
special which he left in 1982 because the show was 
deemphasizing live music he said 
there were some fine moments i remember ray charles and 
aretha franklin and billy preston and at the end of each show wed 
jam this was very unusual for those days for us to put them all 
together was very important 
the wolfman really is bob smith who grew up in a tough 
neighborhood in brooklyn ny his character emerged in the 1960s 
from xerf a mexican station with a signal that carried into the 
united states he later was on xerb another mexican station 
then he appeared in the george lukas movie american 
graffiti which starred ron howard richard dreyfuss harrison 
ford and cindy williams and briefly featured suzanne somers 
it took the wolfman from a cult figure to the rank of american 
flag and apple pie he said it made me legitimate most actors 
go all their life and try for that kind of opportunity the wolfman 
stumbled and fell into it i am very lucky 
so many people got started in that picture it sort of became 
a classic 
hes not so complimentary of a later movie the big chill 
which also featured 60s rock 
it was kind of depressing being about a funeral and all but 
it did depict different kind of people in that age group but i 
didnt particularly care for it 
after american graffiti he began doing various advertising 
campaigns and appeared in more than 40 network tv shows he also 
had his own syndicated tv show the wolfman jack show 
todd rundgren the guess who leon russell and freddie king all 
wrote songs about him 
he currently is a deejay for radio station xtra gold in san 
diego calif broadcasting from his home in beverly hills calif 
his voice he said has been very valuable to him 
its kept meat and potatoes on the table for years for wolfman 
and wolfwoman a couple of shots of whiskey helps it ive got that 
nice raspy sound

just before sunset a golden glow warms 
the big sur coast where highway 1 crosses bixby creek on a bridge 
so graceful it improves its idyllic natural backdrop 
california native richard sears visits the area a halfdozen 
times a year just to stare at the stunning scene 
i feel attached to this place he says in a reverent tone 
i lived in europe for 20 years all the time i was gone i kept 
dreaming about this particular highway this particular spot 
thats why i came home eventually 
sears is not alone in his enthusiasm for the wonders of 
californias 644mile coastal highway if you picture california in 
your mind chances are you are viewing it from highway 1 
maybe its the sight of surfers silhouetted against a santa 
monica sunset or the brightly colored fishing boats chugging out 
of morro bay perhaps its the grandeur of big sur or the quaint 
main street of mendocino if these are the jewels of the california 
coast highway 1 is the necklace 
it became the nations first scenic highway in 1964 when the 
separate segments of the route were linked under the common name of 
highway 1 
the journey north begins at dana point in orange county when the 
pacific coast highway peels off from interstate 5 a chain of beach 
towns makes up this land of surfboards and string bikinis laguna 
newport hermosa redondo manhattan sunset santa monica 
yachts take harbor at newport beach laguna beach attracts 
artists huntington beach is perforated with oil wells everywhere 
there are whitewashed walls of spanishstyle villas redtile roofs 
and dangling boughs of purple bougainvillea 
the highway rolls past venice and the famous santa monica pier 
en route to malibu where celebrities mingle with common folk its 
expensive the traffic is often jammed the land is not stable 
grass fires threaten hillside mansions in the summer monster waves 
damage beachfront homes in the winter yet most people who live 
here wouldnt trade it for nirvana 
highway 1 passes through the lima bean fields and lemon orchards 
of ventura county as it heads up towards santa barbara at gaviota 
it heads west on a journey through time that takes it from cow 
pastures into the space age giant radar domes and distant launch 
pads mark vandenberg air force base the future home of the space 
shuttle 
san luis obispo was the site of a california mission later 
became a quiet college town and today is an oasis for motorists 
with the spanishinfluenced architecture of its relaxed downtown 
it proves an excellent tonic for those too long behind the wheel 
ten miles west is morro bay and a little farther up the coast 
lies san simeon where william randolph hearst built hearst castle 
the dozens of bedrooms in the main house once welcomed the likes of 
gable and lombard presidents and kings the mountaintop mansion is 
now a state park 
the highway now enters big sur 70 miles of coast where the 
dramatic santa lucia mountains drop suddenly to the sea 
the highway dances with the mountains here rising around a 
point high over the ocean then falling gracefully into a sweeping 
curve before spinning again toward the sea 
the deepest canyons are crowned with arching concrete spans 
built like other parts of the highway with the help of convict 
labor from san quentin prison 
the beauty of the 714foot bixby creek bridge belies the 
difficulty of its construction from 300 tons of steel 6600 cubic 
yards of concrete and 300000 board feet of douglas fir used as a 
falsework 
even though 15 million people drive through big sur each year 
the scale of the landscape generates a feeling of isolation for 
some the greatness of the area has inspired many writers and 
artists including author henry miller and photographer ansel adams 
a halfhour north of bixby creek sits reclusive 
carmelbythesea and a few miles farther rests monterey with its 
oncebustling waterfront that now features one of the worlds great 
aquariums 
this is no longer the cannery row that john steinbeck 
immortalized a halfcentury ago but millions still come here 
searching among the crumbling piers for the ghosts of doc and wide 
ida 
the highway races past fort ord on its way to the amusement park 
at the santa cruz boardwalk where a warm summer night conjures the 
smell of cotton candy and the cheap thrill of a rickety wooden 
roller coaster 
another 70 miles of coastline leads the highway to san francisco 
where the routes beauty is lost is a maze of traffic until 
resurfacing across the golden gate in marin county the highway 
clings to the shoulders of mount tamalpais before reaching the 
funky communities of stinson beach and bolinas 
for many a trip along highway 1 on the north coast will seem 
redundant after the scenery further south but the observant will 
find extraordinary beauty in the lagoons and grasslands that have 
become refuge to myriad species including red tail hawks and 
peregrine falcons 
passing through the towns along the north coast bodega bay 
mendocino fort bragg gualala pronounce it wuhlahlah it is 
hard to imagine one is still in the same state as the sunnsurf 
cities of southern california soon even the northern california 
coast is a memory as the highway turns inland through virgin 
redwood groves and indian reservations 
at leggett the highway comes to an anticlimactic end when it 
meets highway 101 and the traveler has the option of continuing on 
the more heavily traveled road or turning around and seeing what 
highway 1 looks like from north to south

on a bluff with a sweeping view of the 
big sur coast 808 feet above the pacific ocean sits a restaurant 
that serves something more with its burgers than a side of fries 
nepenthe has been a popular eatery on highway 1 since the late 
1940s not just with the 15 million motorists who pass by 
annually but with many of the writers artists and thinkers who 
have given big sur its unique reputation as the birthplace of the 
human potential movement 
the restaurant designed by rowan maiden a frank lloyd wright 
disciple makes the most of its view with a dining room surrounded 
by picture windows and a wraparound bilevel patio inside and 
out there are giant fireplaces to ward off the chill of the 
notorious coastal fog 
the food ranging from quiche and burgers to steaks and red 
snapper is good and not unreasonably priced by big sur standards 
but its the history and people of nepenthe that really makes the 
place special 
the restaurant named for a mythical egyptian drug that induced 
forgetfulness and eased sorrow sits beside a log cabin built by 
the equestrian trails club in 1925 
the cabin was purchased by orson welles in the 1940s reportedly 
as a gift for rita hayworth but she never lived there and the 
property was sold again to bill and lolly fassett in 1947 
today nepenthe is managed by their grandson kirk fassett 
granddaughter erin fassett supervises the dining room and lives in 
the rustic cabin 
born and raised in big sur during the 1960s they had a good 
view of social changes here and of the changes in people who gave 
up the straight life somewhere else to seek an alternative 
lifestyle on the california coast 
in big sur there is really only one industry the 
entertainment industry restaurants and inns notes erin so 
people who wanted to live here unless they were independently 
wealthy or selfemployed ended up working in restaurants 
i know people who have phds or were doctors and didnt want 
to be doctors anymore people who dropped out of a different life 
and were working here and thats still true these people have 
gone through a real rebirth in a way a rejuvenation they get 
excited about life again she said 
every night somebody comes through and says i came here 10 
years ago and i was never able to forget it its really kind of a 
haunting community you dont forget it very easily

when gov bob martinez drove a 1929 ford model aa 
truck to open the final 33mile stretch of interstate 95 last dec 
19 it marked the end of a superhighway project that began snaking 
its way from miami to maine 32 years ago 
the idea for the road was born in the 1940s as a way to speed up 
troop movement when needed while aiding the burgeoning east coast 
population it was included in a national interstate network 
outlined in 1956 in the federal aid highway act signed into law by 
president dwight d eisenhower 
ambitious plans called for the entire network 90 percent funded 
by the federal government to be carrying traffic by 1972 
it was designed as an unbroken freeway but its 1866 miles are 
interrupted in central new jersey where there is a short gap near 
trenton the interstate picks up a few miles later where it shares 
the new jersey turnpike plans for completing i95 in new jersey 
were scuttled in 1983 
i95 now runs through all or parts of 15 eastern states and the 
district of columbia from miami to houlton maine 
in parts of the heavilytraveled northeast i95 often becomes a 
traffic nightmare 
howard t owens a state senator from bridgeport conn and 
chairman of the general assemblys transportation committee 
describes the situation on interstate 95 in connecticut as 
absolutely horrendous 
its gridlock from 630 am to after 830 a ride from 
bridgeport to stamford that should take 25 minutes takes more than 
one hour and if every aspect of mass transportation was used by 
the year 2000 wed still have hopeless gridlock owens said 
work on the 222 million final leg in florida began in 
jacksonville in february 1985 with money appropriated by congress 
three years before the last link runs from northeastern palm beach 
county into martin county loops west across the florida turnpike 
and then meanders back toward the coast to connect with what used 
to be a deadend stretch of the highway in st lucie county 
during several years of construction the thenincomplete 
portion of i95 became a favorite runway for drug smugglers 
it became the longest runway in the united states for drug 
smuggling planes james d holt the sheriff of martin county 
said when the link was opened in december 
in florida interstate 95 offers easy access to all of the 
atlantic beaches and is little more than an hour away from disney 
world sea world and many other central florida attractions 
i didnt know whether id live long enough to see it complete 
or not said bill fowler of the state department of 
transportation who helped oversee work on the missing link 
some officials say completion of the section between palm beach 
and st lucie counties in southeastern florida will open the 
treasure coast to commuter traffic from as far away as miami 
you figure a twohour commute to miami really isnt any worse 
than what some people do to get from one end of miami to the other 
or fort lauderdale said martin county commissioner maggy 
hurchalla 
but lance dehavensmith associate director of the florida 
atlantic universityflorida international university joint center 
for the study of environmental and urban problems sees it as one 
more step in the los angelization of south florida

interstate 95 the 1866mile corridor 
that takes truckers snowbirds and salesmen from maine to florida 
begins at the canadian border in this far north potato town 
before reaching bangor the nearest big city i95 winds through 
miles of potato farms brushes the haynesville woods made famous 
by dick curless country and western hit tombstone every mile 
then passes through a strand of white birches before cutting 
through the brooding argyle peat bog 
remote and isolated the only access to points south before the 
opening of the twolane highway in 1966 were state routes 2 and 2a 
hilly winding treacherous roads particularly in winter then 
the trip to bangor could take up to four hours and had to be a 
wellplanned event 
we would go only a couple times a year recalls lois ward 
62 who has lived her entire life in this aroostook county 
shiretown of 6750 wed leave early in the morning do our 
shopping have dinner and it was probably 10 oclock at night 
before we were home it was an all day thing but it was grand 
fun 
today the interstate is a fourlane highway and the speed limit 
65 mph which has cut the driving time to bangor in half 
it was a godsend as far as getting to the southern part of the 
state lifelong area resident robert anderson 50 said of the 
highway the interstate cant be equalled in my opinion 
anywhere 
the opening of the interstate has increased traffic into the 
united states from canada 
when i95 first opened two miles from the mainenew brunswick 
border 4900 people a month entered the united states by 1987 
273000 people and 5000 trucks a month were streaming into the 
country according to marc russell us immigration and 
naturalization service supervisor at the border checkpoint 
the interstate which cost 140 million to build from bangor to 
houlton also created a new business district forcing motels 
restaurants and stores from downtown houlton or route 2a to close 
or move near the highway to accommodate the rerouted traffic 
some believe business has increased in houlton where the 
economy is based on the potato industry and the lumber trade 
there seems to be more activity in houlton than there has been 
in prior years said anderson an insurance and real estate 
agent maybe thats just a gut feeling but there seems to be 
more construction i think development around an interstate seems 
to snowball 
while the road has made access to southern maine easier life in 
houlton as one resident says hasnt changed much 
its just a long way from the rest of the world mrs ward 
said even though you can get to bangor in just under two hours 
you still have a long way to go if you want to go to boston

once called the hermit kingdom south 
korea is preparing to entertain the world at the 1988 olympic games 
and show just how much things have changed 
the country which for centuries tried to seal itself off from 
the world has been transformed in recent years into one of asias 
most modern and fastestgrowing nations staging the olympics is 
the crowning glory of south koreas economic rise 
seoul a sprawling city of 10 million people has been preparing 
for years to host the games and ensure that everything is right 
when the olympic spotlight turns on south korea beginning sept 17 
the city of highrise buildings broad avenues and meticulous 
neatness is dotted with olympic flags and banners for the games 
the five interlocked circles symbol of the olympic movement is 
stamped on everything from milk cartons and television logos to 
carriages in the seoul subway system 
the no 1 games the no 1 people proclaim the subway signs 
on every carriage door 
counters ticking off the days to the start of the games stand 
outside all government offices and police stations in every subway 
station and in many shops and businesses some buildings even have 
little counters in the elevators 
newspapers are filled with articles on the olympics seoul taxi 
drivers are taking courses in english and other foreign languages 
homeowners are being urged to provide accommodation for tourists 
and hotels and new shops are under construction all over seoul 
the sprawling olympic park in the south of seoul with its giant 
stadiums tracks and pools is ready for the games workers scurry 
around the immaculate complex every day polishing the stadiums and 
trimming lawns and trees 
but visitors hoping to attend the olympic games had better 
already have firm hotel and airline reservations accommodation is 
likely to be scarce with more than 200000 visitors expected 
visitors who want to get the real flavor of korea should get off 
the main streeets and take a walk through the sidestreets and 
alleys that are usually just one block over street life in seoul 
is colorful and entertaining 
little shops offer brightly colored quilts and basketwork 
antique dealers sell old pottery and elaborate korean chests stall 
holders are everywhere selling fruit vegetables and flowers 
sidewalk vendors or little makeshift restraurants offer onion 
pancakes rice noodles in red pepper sauce and jam and almond paste 
cakes roast chestnuts and dried squid 
koreans like to socialize over food and drink and seoul is 
covered with thousands of restaurants beer halls tea rooms snack 
counters and sidewalk vendors serving a vast range of dishes 
korean food offers distinctive spicy dishes such as pulgogi a 
barbecued beef that is cooked at your table and kalbi or barbecued 
beef ribs kimchi fiery pickled cabbage that is the most famous 
dish in korean cuisine accompanies just about every meal 
another pleasure are the many small and inexpensive noodle and 
rice restaurants where a steaming bowl of fish or beef soup can be 
had with noodles or rice for 2 or 3 
many visitors enjoy sampling both local brews and korean society 
by visiting korean beerhalls where local beers and a potent 
sorghum liquor called soju are served koreans love to sing and 
strangers and friends join in everything from country and western 
hits to haunting korean love melodies 
seoul has much to offer shoppers with bargains in clothes 
luggage shoes and leather goods porcelain oriental prints 
fabric and inexpensive jewelery several fur companies offer 
bargain fur coats that shoppers pick up at the airport on their way 
out 
the city is covered with shops department stores arcades and 
markets many visitors head for the itaewon district where english 
is widely spoken 
more colorful are the vast open air markets at tongdaemun and 
namdaemun where vendors sell everything from sneakers and bolts of 
brilliantly colored silk to live carp and turtles for dinner 
foreign visitors invariably say language is the biggest problem 
they encounter english and other foreign languages are not widely 
spoken but koreans will happily assist guests and smiles nods and 
hand gestures are often sufficient 
one problem confronting olympic visitors will be very strict 
security that could make getting around difficult at times during 
the games 
the government concerned about possible terrorist threats from 
rival communist north korea will deploy tens of thousands of 
troops and police to ensure the safety of the games and the 
visitors

the seoul metropolitan government has established a homestay 
program involving 668 korean families to cater to foreign tourists 
expected for the olympic games in september 
part of the preparation for the host homes involves learning 
westernstyle cooking 
the basic price of the homestay program 25 a person per 
night includes breakfast and obviously most western visitors 
will not be used to the koreanstyle morning meal of soup fish 
rice and kimchi a spicy cabbage dish said a city government 
official 
we want to be able to offer them the kind of breakfast dishes 
they are used to at home thats no problem in our citys hotels 
but perhaps a new cooking experience for some korean housewives 
the homes in the program which is operated by the korea travel 
bureau include traditional koreanstyle houses and modern 
apartments

dolphins their 
bodies luminous in the black sea swam alongside the bow in the 
dark moonless night playfully racing our sailboat as it cut 
through the water on the second night of our trip to the galapagos 
islands 
a few hours later they frolicked just outside the porthole of 
our cabin waking us up with their highpitched whistles seemingly 
to watch their midnight antics 
by then we were hooked on the wonders of these fascinating 
islands located some 600 miles off the coast of ecuador in the 
pacific ocean and populated with strange and unusual birds 
reptiles and animals 
these islands are a unique entity related to no other part of 
this planet writes tui de roy moore in her book galapagos 
islands lost in time 
they contain mountains forests beaches and bays unlike any 
others on the earth she said here animals and plants have 
evolved into unique forms some have survived scarcely changed 
from prehistoric times 
indeed a visit to the islands there are 13 large ones and 
dozens of small ones and reefs spread over about 18000 square 
miles is to go back in time 
charles darwin the english naturalist visited the islands in 
1835 aboard the ship beagle his observations were key in 
formulating the theory of evolution 
in his book darwin and the beagle alan moorehead quotes 
darwin as saying about the islands 
here both in space and time we seem to be brought somewhere 
near to that great fact that mystery of mysteries the first 
appearance of new beings on this earth 
that sense of mystery remains 
grayblack swirls and coils left by flowing lava at the turn of 
this century still virtually intact stretch eerily as far as the 
eye can see at sullivan bay on santiago island 
marine iguanas their heads like armored helmets shaped at the 
dawn of time sun their grayish bodies on rocks at james bay also 
on santiago island 
the giant tortoises the name galapagos comes from the spanish 
word for tortoise lumber across the landscape much as their 
prehistoric ancestors did they are the worlds largest a ranking 
shared only with a species on the seychelles the islands in the 
indian ocean 
sailing in a 48foot yacht we were able to visit six of the 
islands in five days and see a wide variety of animals birds and 
reptiles in their natural habitat as well as hike over volcanic 
terrain 
the trips are regulated by the galapagos national park service 
which limits visitors to 26000 a year tourists are restricted 
where they can walk so they dont disturb the islands ecology 
we slept and ate aboard the yacht food was prepared by a cook 
who used local products to make such ecuadorean specialties as a 
mashed potatoes and cheese dish called llapingachos ceviche topped 
with popcorn and desserts of sweet tomatoes 
a guide approved by the park service traveled with us pointing 
out bluefooted boobies lava herons and swallowtailed gulls by 
day and constellations by night 
never having been threatened by humans the islands creatures 
are extraordinarily tame nearly all were unfazed by our presence 
enormous colonies of sea lions some swimming others sparring 
and one even nursing a pup on south plaza island let us walk 
gingerly among them without scurrying away 
some even turned the tables and inspected us 
a young sea lion pulled himself out of a shallow pool at james 
bay to get a closer look with his tiny ears alert he sniffed a 
friends white jogging shoe before slithering away to dry off on a 
warm cliff 
a tiny penguin darted around us swimming as we snorkeled in 
beautifully clear water near pinnacle rock on bartolome island a 
pelican maybe hoping for some leftovers from our cook perched 
atop the motor on the dinghy behind our yacht 
a few creatures were decidedly unfriendly and we werent 
certain about the intentions of two sharks spotted circling one 
night when our becalmed yacht stalled for more than an hour during 
a long sail in the deserted waters between two islands 
the captain of our boat reassured us that galapagos sharks were 
special like the islands other creatures vegetarians he 
said with a big smile

men and women with heavy loads on their 
backs trudge the roads of pokhara some are trekkers americans 
europeans australians going up into the mountains others are 
gurung tribesmen coming down with loads of cloth or grain 
pokhara 124 miles west of katmandu owes its existence to the 
majestic sweep of half a dozen himalayan peaks to the north it 
calls itself gateway to annapurna after the tallest at 26504 
feet 
it is crowded with young tourists chattering about treks and 
older ones waiting hopefully for frequent clouds and mist to part 
for a glimpse of the snowy peaks 
it was not always so in fact says retired british col jom 
roberts pokhara was once one of the worlds most isolated places 
anything you can see here cut it down it didnt exist 
roberts said recalling his initial visit as one of the first 
westerners into the pokhara valley in 1950 
nepal was closed to tourists until 1951 and the ony way to 
pokhara was to walk french climber maurice herzog the first 
european to conquer a major himalayan peak bypassed the place en 
route to his conquest of annapurna i on june 3 1950 
roberts said that on his second visit in 1957 he saw only an 
airstrip and a tree even the oxcart ubiquitous in south asia did 
not arrive in pokhara until 1961 brought in by aircraft 
today where only rocky paths existed a string of villages 
makes up the town of pokhara corrugated tin shops thatch shacks 
and concreteblock houses have sprung up willynilly 
about 70000 people live in the area many are gurungs or mayars 
who came down from the hills to settle after seeing the outside 
world in the famed gurkha regiments in which roberts also served 
db thapa of the government tourist office said 70000 visitors 
also come to pokhara each year 
but natives and foreigners rarely collide since tribesmen do 
their business in the mahendra pul area north of the airport and 
westerners hang out near lake phewa to the west 
at the native bazaar most signs are in nepali script though 
the shakva tailors advertises satisfaction is our garent a 
search for books in english turns up only basic chemistry and 
similar texts 
the lakeside by contrast is a bibliophiles dream 16 
bookstores can be found in a 15minute walk with titles in a 
halfdozen languages traded or sold by wandering readers 
at one shop the bible in german shares a shelf with ill take 
manhattan by judith krantz tolstoys war and peace and 
annapurna premier 8000 herzogs tale of his conquest nearby 
are books on mountains and mysticism along with batik versions of 
the tantric erotic art carved on nepals hindu temples 
the rest of the lakeside is a similar international jumble the 
amica german hair composer axis steaks and pizza the monsoon 
restaurant japanese food and tranquility lodge offering 
harmony peace and good energy 
you can get a room in pokhara from 15 rupees to 1500 
rupees 70 cents to 70 dollars said ranga nath timilshina 
19 who was hawking the amrit hotel four rooms each with bath 
added to his familys lakeside home 
a friend 22yearold madabah prasad neupane leaned on his 
bicycle and mused about changes since pokharas hotel boom began in 
the late 1960s people here used to be farmers now they find the 
hotel business is an easy way to get money he said 
roberts grumbles about the concrete mess of todays pokhara 
but his trekking service here makes him part of the place he even 
has a role in one supposed legend of the ersatz town 
one guidebook relates how an expedition that roberts led in 1957 
to climb 22958foot macha pucchare fishtail peak the nearest to 
the town turned back because sherpa guides feared the wrath of 
the mountain goddess 
not so said roberts the sherpas had no superstitions and it 
was two british climbers who were forced to quit about 150 feet 
from the top 
we were beaten by the mountain he said 
its still not been climbed he added its nice to have 
something untouched

conner prairie one of the nations 
most authentic 19thcentury villages is adding something new a 
stateoftheart 105 million museum center 
the museum center will open may 7 with a twoday celebration 
conner prairie six miles north of indianapolis depicts the 
lives times attitudes and values of indianas first settlers it 
stretches over 250 acres and attracts 200000 visitors annually 
youre in your own historical novel or personal john wayne 
movie said frank werner who supervises the museums 
documentation people who know nothing of the 1830s come out here 
and suddenly find themselves wrapped up in the history we awaken 
people to the realities good and bad 
the museum center will house a permanent gallery temporary 
exhibition hall audiovisual program restaurant 100seat 
theater library classrooms and administrative offices 
the center has been designed as a complement to the village 
museum smokeswoman brenda myers says its a modern visitors 
center meant to augment whats outside the village is real so why 
imitate 
open since 1974 conner prairie features citizens 
interpreting everyday events from a 19thcentury perspective 
visitors are encouraged to participate in handson activities as 
they circulate among the towns 30 authentic buildings 
kids can poke around and play here and that doesnt happen at 
most historic sites myers said there are so many generic 
living history museums and no touch places out there thats what 
we want to avoid 
we encourage active participation because we want visitors to 
get not only a sense of how people lived but how they felt how 
better to learn history 
werner said family members of all ages enjoy chatting with the 
more than 100 history interpreters at conner prairie and joining 
them in weaving making soap cooking working with wood and 
playing pioneer games 
you cant describe what the interpreters do as acting said 
werner who also participates in the roleplaying it goes beyond 
acting youre recreating social political cultural and emotional 
circumstances 
he also underlined the museums success in educating visitors 
in some cases despite themselves 
people expect the typical history museum where everything is 
over there and roped off werner said but here no ones 
lecturing you peoples hesitancy breaks down and they become a 
part of the village we impart factual knowledge without their 
knowing it 
evening concerts on the prairie candlelight walks and 
hearthside suppers are among the special programs scheduled 
yearround at the museum families can also relive the pioneer 
experience by reserving a rustic cabin on the prairie or by 
attending horse races weddings funerals and political debates in 
the village 
we generally have funerals in the fall because that was the 
cholera season we aim to make visitors feel and understand that 
these are real people not just historic figures myers said 
everything here has to be tried and true and confirmed by at 
least three sources 
international pharmaceutical heir eli lilly originally purchased 
the property in 1934 with his wife he restored the original 
william conner home decorating it with period antiques before 
donating it and the surrounding farmland to earlham college in 1964 
conner a frontiersman trader and statesman was instrumental 
in developing central indiana during the early 19th century

dixieland was a big cheaply constructed frame house of 18 or 
20 drafty highceilinged rooms it had a rambling unplanned 
gabular appearance 
in thomas wolfes autobiographical first novel look homeward 
angel dixieland was the fictional name for the place called 
old kentucky home a boarding house run by his mother in his 
birthplace of asheville nc wolfe moved into the boarding house 
when he was about 6 years old 
the construction was after her own plans wolfe wrote of the 
house and of the cheapest material it never lost the smell of 
raw wood cheap varnish and flimsy rough plastering 
wolfes mother julia the eliza of look homeward angel 
bought the house in 1906 for 6500 she renovated it added rooms 
and a sun porch and rented to traveling salesmen vaudeville 
performers school teachers and others her business cards 
advertised large lawns no sick people rates reasonable 
wolfes father wo refused to become a part of the enterprise 
and stayed at the old family home on woodfin street now a ymca 
the boarders provided wolfe with much material for his novels 
look homeward angel shocked asheville residents of the 
time who objected to the unvarnished thinlydisguised portraits 
of those in wolfes fictional town of altamont the book was 
banned from the local asheville library 
but today theres renewed interest in thomas wolfe the 1988 
pulitzer prize for biography went to david herbert donald for 
look homeward a life of thomas wolfe and asheville nc is 
saying you can go home again 
the 28room boarding house at 48 spruce st spring st in

a living history attraction is featured this may 1415 with 
role players at the house wearing period costumes of 1916 the year 
wolfe left asheville to attend the university of north carolina in 
chapel hill 
we try very hard to present the house and its inhabitants 
exactly as they were back then says steve hill site manager of 
the wolfe memorial the costumes of the people playing the role 
of boarders are specially made to assure their authenticity 
once visitors enter the home they will think they have taken 
a trip back in time to 1916 even the music we play is from that 
time period 
the house reflects the early 1900s with furnishings and many 
personal effects intact an upstairs bedroom contains wolfes 
belongings from his new york apartment including clothing a 
writing table and typewriter which he never used preferring to 
write in longhand

george w vanderbilt mansion built in asheville in 1885 by 
architect richard morris hunt and landscape designer frederick law 
olmsted 
touted as the largest grandest residential estate ever built 
in america the renaissancestyle chateau has 250 rooms and 17 
acres of gardens built as vanderbilts dream house in the 
mountains outside of asheville it originally encompassed 125000

the consumer uprising by air travelers appears 
to be easing a bit as the 1988 summer travel season approaches 
complaints about airline service though still coming into the 
transportation department at the rate of several thousand a month 
have eased as airlines try to eliminate what irritates travelers 
the most 
under government pressure the major air carriers have scheduled 
flights more realistically eased the bunching of flights around 
busy travel times and funneled additional manpower and money into 
dealing with their customers 
much of the confusion and inconvenience is behind us now 
said stephen hayes vice president for public information at the 
air transport association the airline trade group 
hayes acknowledged past problems but suggested in a recent 
speech that the airlines are determined to provide better service 
cornish hitchcock legal affairs director for the aviation 
consumer action project a public interest group that keeps tabs on 
aviation issues and has been critical of the industry in the past 
also suggests that perhaps the worst consumer problems in aviation 
may be over 
at least he says there may not be the indifference to the 
plight of passengers that marked 1987 as far as many of the major 
air carriers were concerned 
im not sure you can declare victory yet said hitchcock in 
an interview adding that the test is likely to come as the busy 
summer travel season begins 
for millions of people who travel by air 1987 often became a 
nightmare in june of last year the transportation department 
received as many complaints about air travel as it had received in 
all of the previous five months members of congress began talking 
of reregulating the industry and on more than one occasion unruly 
passengers stormed a ticket counter because a flight had been 
canceled or they faced long delays 
the turmoil and pressure from congress caused the transportation 
department to get tough with the airlines 
they were told to stop scheduling flights unrealistically 
knowing that delays would result and in a major change the 
airlines were told beginning last september to make detailed 
reports to the government about their ontime performance as well 
as complaints about mishandled bags and problems with overbooking 
after six months of such reports it became clear that even in a 
good month about onefifth of the flights by 14 major airlines are 
likely to be late the airlines worst performance came last october 
when onethird of the flights were late 
today the ontime record of each flight can be provided by a 
travel agent or airline reservation clerk through the reservation 
computer a code shows how often a flight has been on time in the 
previous month although a customer normally must ask for the 
information 
but travelers so far have not availed themselves to such 
information on a widescale basis according to travel agents 
furthermore some critics have argued that the information is of 
minimal value because often a traveler has little choice as to 
which flight to take to a particular city 
many members of congress want more detailed consumer reporting 
by the airlines but consumer legislation aimed at the airlines has 
been bogged down in a dispute over testing airline employes for 
drugs 
airline opposition is strongest to provisions in pending 
legislation that would require the transportation department as 
well as airlines to provide tollfree telephone lines for consumer 
complaints provide free tickets for lost baggage require that 
tickets be refundable and require airlines to establish a minimum 
time for flights 
these provisions if approved would force the cutback of service 
and harm consumers the airlines have argued 
meanwhile the airlines are not yet certain what if any 
problems will develop this summer from two new requirements from 
the federal aviation administration 
a new regulation that bans smoking on flights of two hours or 
less could unleash not only confrontations aboard aircraft but 
prompt a range of complaints about enforcement 
furthermore neither the airlines nor travelers have gotten 
accustomed to carryon baggage restrictions that went into effect 
at the beginning of the year 
as the busy travel season begins both the smoking and baggage 
rules are likely to result in at least some friction says 
hitchcock

groups that represent the handicapped are 
eagerly awaiting a transportation department regulation expected 
within a few months that they hope will clarify their rights 
aboard commercial airliners 
people who must use wheelchairs or are blind have complained for 
years that they are being discriminated against and often 
embarrassed when they travel by air 
the battle lines between the handicapped and the airline 
industry have at times been tense according to the national 
federation of the blind there have been more than 20 blind people 
arrested and taken from aircraft because of disputes over seating 
or other issues 
what the blind want most is simple straightforward 
uncomplicated and reasonable we want to be left alone to buy our 
tickets and fly in peace marc mauer president of the 
federation told a government panel last september 
the new regulations are expected to provide broad guidelines to 
the airlines on how they should accommodate the handicapped and 
also provide specific requirements 
once we get these regulations in draft form a lot of people 
will finally know what their rights are and the airlines will know 
what their obligations are things will be a lot clearer says 
david capozzi an official of the paralyzed veterans of america 
the regulations stem from the air carrier access act enacted by 
congress in 1986 to specifically guarantee the rights of the 
handicapped to have access to air travel without discrimination 
capozzi who uses a wheelchair said issues still to be resolved 
include 
the question of where handicapped passengers should be allowed 
to sit federal regulations include no seating restrictions 
although many airlines have policies that direct handicapped to be 
seated in certain sections of a plane 
should airlines be allowed to set a limit on the number of 
handicapped people to allow on a single flight airlines want to 
restrict such passengers to no more than the number of emergency 
exits on an aircraft 
should a handicapped traveler be required to be accompanied by 
an attendant advocacy groups for the handicapped argue that should 
be up to the traveler involved 
the seating issue is among the most controversial 
the airlines want the government to specifically exclude 
handicapped passengers from certain seats such as the row next to 
an emergency exit but groups representing the handicapped scoff at 
suggestions that a blind person might be a liability in such a 
location they also say that if there is a restriction it should be 
limited to the door adjacent to the exit and not an entire row 
some airlines require the handicapped to be seated in specific 
seats in an aircraft recently a blind passenger aboard a midway 
airlines jet was arrested when she refused to move from the smoking 
section at the rear of the plane to the first row close to an exit 
door 
capozzi said that the incident was an example of another problem 
facing the handicapped 
they the airlines treat the disabled persn as a homogenized 
group you need to look at the individual differences he says 
travelers who are confined to wheelchairs for example like the 
first row of an airplane because of the easy access but to a blind 
person that same requirement may not be irrelevant he suggests

shamu namu and kandu are readying a 
killer of a sea show that organizers hope will fishtail with the 
alamo and the citys river walk 
while the killer whales swim around in a 7 million gallon tank 
gardeners are putting the final landscaping touches on sea world of 
texas a 140 million 250acre facility billed as the nations 
largest marine theme park 
the parks big splash opening is set for may 28 but 
workers animals and trainers are already performing in rehearsals 
for visitors 
sea world 13 miles northwest of downtown san antonio will be 
open yearround it is expected to employ 2000 people during its 
peak summer season generate a 25 million annual payroll and 
attract 3 million visitors bearing another 300 million yearly for 
the parks and south texas economies 
city and tourist industry officials have looked at sea world as 
a magnet for tourists to help the state diversify from its 
dependency on petroleum but sea world chairman george becker warns 
against expecting too much too soon 
ive cautioned a few people that well do the very best that 
we can but not to rest on their laurels and expect us to be the 
endall and the answer to all of their business problems he said 
visitors can expect to see the parks star shamu a twoton 
killer whale that was among the fish and animals brought in from 
three other sea world parks around the country 
shamu will perform in a 4500seat stadium at other smaller 
stadiums dolphins seals sea lions walruses and other animals 
will show their stuff too 
skiers will perform acrobatics in a 12acre lake and visitors 
can walk across the united states via a oneacre map of the 
country 
there are restaurants lounges a disco for teenagers and a 
playground for children there also is cypress gardens west a 
botanical center where a variety of flowers will bloom yearround 
san antonio tourism already generates more than 1 billion 
annually with lures like the alamo and the river walk 
texas is home to six flags of texas in arlington and to 
astroworld in houston both of which attract about 17 million 
visitors a year each 
tourist industry officials believe sea world will help not 
hurt those amusement parks 
its actually going to help them because it completes the 
triangle of from san antonio houston and the dallasfort worth 
area said larry todd director of the texas tourist agency 
he said sea world is following the lead of other tourist 
attractions by promoting texas first and its location second 
i dont think tourism is a panacea but its all fresh new 
money and its an immediate boost to the economy and its rapidly 
becoming one of our top industries todd said

as the wellknown old european capital cities london paris 
rome slowly regain travel favor with americans andrew harpers 
hideaway report provides a list of enchanting small hotels he 
describes as wellmanaged personalized properties nestled in 
uniquely private settings 
harper is a pseudonym for the editor and publisher who travels 
the world incognito for a monthly newsletter directed primarily at 
top business executives with a median annual income of more than 
200000 
his choices as 1987 hideaways of the year in europe include 
these country house hotels 
park hotel kenmare kenmare ireland 
chewton glen new milton england 
bodysgallen hall llandudno wales 
arisaig house arisaig scotland

zurserhof zurs am arlberg austria 
falsled kro falsled denmark 
il pellicano porto ercole italy 
wald and schlosshotel friedrichsruhe near ohringen west 
germany 
pousada da rainha santa isabel estremaz portugal 
two urban sanctuaries listed by harper as best small hotels 
are the plaza in copenhagen denmark and the hotel de orangerie in 
bruges belgium 
his selections he says are based on service charm comfort 
decor food and the intangible q factor that separates the good 
from the truly enchanting 
harper who promotes his newsletter as a connoisseurs guide 
to peaceful and unspoiled places limits his circulation to about 
15000 and carries no advertising he says his subscribers are 
willing to pay a premium to get away from other people in a very 
crowded world 
in 1987 more than 6 million americans visited europe about 18 
percent more than the previous year according to the european 
travel commission etc said it was the second best year ever for 
us travel to europe topped only by the 64 million total of 1985

soho the bohemian neighborhood famed for its 
smorgasbord of restaurants and expensive touristoriented topless 
bars is cleaning up its naughty image 
families are moving back to the once seedy halfmile square area 
of central london that was originally settled by immigrants and 
refugees 
trendy restaurants wine bars and media companies are moving 
next door to generationsold firms of tailors silversmiths and 
clockmakers reclaiming the classic georgian buildings from what 
was collectively known as the vice 
part of soho has become the capitals chinatown with gerard 
street converted into a busy mall lined with chinese restaurants 
supermarkets bookstores and pay phones with pagodastyle roofs 
the impetus for change came from sohos residents who were tired 
of gazing out their windows at pulsating pink neon signs boasting 
girls girls girls and of having to slink past peep shows 
pornographic cinemas lingerie shops and topless bars every time 
they took their children to school or shopped for groceries 
the local community realized that it was them or us 
explained bryan burrough chairman of the soho society and we 
wanted to make sure it was us 
soho became synonymous with sleaze during world war ii when 
american soldiers swarmed to its clubs and pubs but burrough said 
soho didnt hit rock bottom until the mid1970s 
prior to the mid1960s the vice was represented in the main 
by prostitutes who were fairly unnoticeable he said 
in the 1970s it became sex cinemas topless encounter bars 
all sorts of things totally outside the provisions of the law so 
ordinary legitimate businesses were being pushed out 
the 1000member soho society was founded in 1972 as a community 
group and one of first accomplishments was to have soho declared a 
conservation area meaning nothing can be demolished without 
permission from the westminster borough council 
westminster then passed tougher laws to regulate the flesh 
trade the borough set aside just 10 licenses for sex shops and a 
spokeswoman says only five were actually issued all to book and 
video stores 
burrough said about 20 more sex shops still operate illegally 
compared with a decade ago when 185 soho buildings were devoted to 
the sex industry he said 18 such buildings were on greek street 
alone but now its four short blocks are home to 18 restaurants 
three pubs two sandwich bars a patisserie and only one sex shop 
soho in the heart of londons west end theater district is 
bounded by oxford street regent street charing cross road and 
leicester square 
the name is thought to come from the ancient harehunting cry 
soho the areas cosmopolitan flavor dates back to its first 
immigrants french protestants known as huguenots who arrived in 
the late 1600s germans and italians many of them cooks and 
waiters arrived in the 1860s and 1870s followed by polish and 
russian jews many of them tailors in the 1890s 
joining the melting pot were families from almost every other 
european country as well as british colonies past and present 
indians and hong kong chinese 
in the 1960s a favorite soho haunt was carnaby street with its 
swinging fashion shops stocked with bellbottoms gogo boots 
miniskirts and fishnet stockings 
today sohos nooks and crannies are still packed with old 
established family businesses here the savile row tailors have 
their workshops and gold lace is handmade for buckingham palaces 
livery 
sprinkled among them are dozens of new film production and 
distribution offices film laboratories advertising agencies and 
other support services for londons tv and cinema industry 
street for street soho is said to have more restaurants than 
any other part of london ranging from japanese sushi bars to a 
1950sstyle chrome and formica diner 
gourmets and gourmands can wallow in a cheese shop offering 200 
varieties including cartiresized wheels of swiss emmenthal a 
coffee shop sells 25 types of fresh aromatic beans and barbecued 
ducks hang in chinese markets

take the train thats the message of railroads 
all over europe north america and japan 
their lures include rail passes and reduced rates tours 
sponsored by the railroads or by companies using rail 
transportation and rideabit driveabit arrangements covering 
trains and cars 
railroads have taken into account that a person may not want to 
ride the rails continuously day after day and yet wants full 
moneys worth from his pass so some offer passes that are good for 
perhaps nine days of train travel within a 21day period or 16 days 
within a month or other combinations eurails flexipass and the 
french railpass fall into this category 
the flexipass is one of eurails four types of passes all first 
class and covering 16 countries from austria and greece to portugal 
and ireland but not britain for that one would want the first 
class or economy class britrail pass 
eurail britrail and the france railpass all must be purchased 
outside the countries concerned 
travelers seeking to concentrate on a given region might look 
into the scandinavian rail pass covering denmark finland norway 
and sweden and sold in the scandinavian countries or the benelux 
tourrail pass covering belgium the netherlands and luxembourg and 
sold only in those countries 
the european travel commission also lists more than a dozen 
countries that have their own passes they include italy btlc 
pass ireland rambler austria austrian network pass and 
switzerland swiss holiday card 
a number of countries also offer discounts of up to 50 percent 
for senior citizens or sell halffare cards entitling a traveler to 
halffare on all train travel for a given period 
on this side of the atlantic amtrak has its all aboard america 
fares enabling people to take the train to any destination within 
one region of the country for a set roundtrip price within two 
regions for a bit more and across the entire country for still 
another set price one intermediate stop is allowed each way 
amtrak also offers a 7 return fare under which the purchaser of a 
oneway ticket in many cases can get the return trip for only 7 
on regular amtrak fares seniors get a discount 
canadas railroad system via has a canrailpass and a 
youthrailpass which can be purchased in canada and senior 
citizens get onethird off regular fares 
in japan there are firstclass and ordinary rail passes and a 
new undersea tunnel more than 33 miles linking the main island of 
honshu with hokkaido to the north 
in many countries passes also carry such perks as cutrate 
entry to places of interest or free travel on city buses or subways 
this is just a glimpse along the tracks railroads urge 
travelers to consider all the options before they make a choice 
sometimes a senior discount for instance or a onetime payment 
for halffare privileges might be a bigger bargain than a pass 
many americans unused to trains may feel lost without a car 
the railroads have the answer a car waiting at the station 
explore the countryside return the car and board the train again 
for the next destination and the next car eurail users can even 
leave the car involved in another country in some cases 
for travelers who dont want to lift a finger there are tours 
by rail mexicos famed copper canyon with its 37 bridges and 86 
tunnels canada coasttocoast a nostalgic trip on the orient 
express from istanbul to zurich switzerland you name it the less 
ambitious can take oneday excursions from paris to the chateau 
country or london to bath stonehenge and salisbury for instance 
tours take care of luggage hotels many meals sightseeing and 
escorts to tell one what its all about and leap the language 
barrier

a japanese method of massage that follows the patterns used in 
acupuncture a person can become involved with a scotch hose swiss 
shower salt glo polarity reflexology thalassotherapy or sit 
it out in a roman bath a heated seawater jacuzzi with benches 
the average person pedaling an exercise bike and swimming laps 
at the y may think spas are not for her or him too expensive 
not so say the spa people who say you can find some costing only 
a few hundred dollars a week per person 
ryan vollmer in affordable spas amp fitness resorts says 
nearly 90 percent of spas now operating in the united states cost 
less than 1000 a week and some are priced in the 400 to 500 
range 
some are advertised for even less spend a week at a new 
hampshire retreat that emphasizes stressreduction by massage 
yoga meditation long walks in the woods sunbathing and swimming

temperatures of 98 to 120 degrees at a kerosenelit hotel on ground 
that was considered sacred for healing by the indians bring your 
own food and cook it on a country stove all these places are under 
400 
at the other end of the price list are such establishments as 
californias golden door whose fans insist its worth every bit of 
the more than 3000 one will spend for a weeks hospitality 
jeffrey joseph of spafinders has found that the spa market is a 
united states one if americans go abroad he says its usually to 
wellknown resorts such as montecatini in italy badenbaden west 
germany or baden switzerland 
but there are bargains waiting all over europe and other 
countries including australia margaret island in the danube at 
budapest the greek island of kos yugoslavia and austria and

ripoffs and muggings of foreign 
tourists are giving rio an image problem and the government 
discreetly is trying to persuaded gringos to skip this famous 
city and visit other parts of vast brazil 
theres only one trouble spot for tourists in brazil and 
thats rio de janeiro joao doria jr president of embratur the 
federal government tourist board told the ap 
police figures are imprecise but almost every day rio 
newspapers carry stories of americans europeans and even latins 
from the spanishspeaking part of south america complaining of 
1000 percent jackups of taxi fares thefts of cameras and wallets 
from beaches and hotel rooms and even outright stickups sometimes 
by armed robbers 
a federal government poster at rios international airport shows 
a dolllike figure wearing shorts and a flowery shirt with a 
camera around its neck written below in big letters is respeite 
o turista or respect the tourist in portuguese brazils 
language 
embraturs official line is that rio is still a great place but 
meanwhile the agency is trying to make it easier for foreigners to 
visit other parts of the country 
many foreigners dont realize that brazil is bigger in area than 
the 48 contiguous united states and tropical beach cities such as 
recife and natal at the countrys northeastern tip and the amazon 
jungle gateway of manaus are thousands of miles closer to the 
northern hemisphere than rio is 
brazils varig airlines has a daily nonstop run from miami to 
rio but one extra flight on that route stops weekly in manaus 
where embratur has begun a program of ecological tourism aimed 
at the appreciation for and preservation of the remarkable flora 
and fauna along the tributaries of the amazon river 
varig air france and air portugal now include recife with its 
miles of palmfringed balmy beaches and precious portuguese 
colonial architecture on some of their european flights 
we want to increase airline competition to brazilian entry 
points that are not now generally well known doria said the 
goal is to reduce air fares and attract more visitors 
despite its climate scenery music and cheap currency brazil 
attracts just 1 percent of world tourism and of the 2 million 
annual visitors most come from neighboring argentina and uruguay 
with the united states in third place followed by italy and west 
germany 
because brazil is a poor country surrounded by poor 
countries in the faroff southern hemisphere it will never 
compete with places such as mexico spain and italy for 
international tourism doria said but we do think 
realistically we can get our share up to 3 percent 
but brazils own typical latin bureaucracy often gets in the way 
of tourism objectives 
the air force ministry which determines international airline 
routes has been reluctant to promote unrestricted air competition 
the ministry has been let us say conservative in this area but 
still we are making progress doria said five years ago no 
charter flights were permitted in brazil today we have them every 
week from north america and europe 
brazils foreign relations ministry often makes foreign tourists 
obtain a visa before they can come to brazil the standard is 
reciprocity if a foreign country requires a visa for brazilians 
then citizens of that country must get a visa for brazil 
sometimes what sounds right diplomatically doesnt make sense 
economically doria said of the visa policy take the case of 
canada which recently instituted visas for brazil because some 
brazilian tourists were caught working there illegally so now 
canadians need visas to visit brazil but i cant imagine many 
canadians seeking to work illegally in brazil 
our own governments countermeasures was not in our countrys 
best interests financially speaking doria said

some of his armys deficiencies yet wrote to his wife i trust 
that a kind providence will watch over us and notwithstanding our 
weakness and sins will yet give us a name and place among the 
nations of the earth 
the excerpts are from a national park service daybook of the 
campaign part of the national commemoration of the 125th 
anniversary of the key battle at the gettysburg pa national 
military park

simulate the battle firing blanks from original and 
authenticlooking civil war guns and cannons

the conflict that became the high water mark of the 
confederacy on july 1 1863 the confederate army of northern 
virgina pushed the union army of the potomac from its positions

hotels are going up so 
fast at playa dorada resort that golf vistas include halfbuilt 
buildings as well as palm trees and sunbathers have to walk past 
construction workers and cement mixers to get to the beach 
fresh water and electricity are in short supply and the 
romantic candles guests find in their rooms really are there to 
tide them through blackouts 
but never mind tourists drawn by white sand beaches warm 
winter breezes and bargain prices are flocking to this 
spanishspeaking nation and making it the most popular caribbean 
destination after puerto rico and the bahamas 
tourism minister fernando rainieri says i hope to make the 
dominican republic the tourism mecca of the caribbean before 1990 
just a few years ago such an expectation would have seemed 
hopelessly optimistic in 1979 there were only 3400 hotel rooms 
in the whole country direct flights were few and marketing efforts 
haphazard 
today resorts like puerta plata and la romana are as well known 
as cancun mexico and montego bay jamaica 
visitor arrivals jumped 21 percent to 791380 last year and are 
up 60 percent this decade hotel capacity has soared to 12000 
rooms and is expected to reach 23000 in time for the 1991 winter 
season 
the boom is the result of increased promotional efforts a 
favorable exchange rate the us dollar that bought 1 peso four 
years ago now buys more than 5 and generous financial incentives 
for investors 
airlines increased seats by 50 percent in 1987 rainieri said 
and plan to do the same this year 
the industry is the brightest spot in an economy where one of 
every two workers is jobless or only marginally employed and one 
in four lives below the poverty line 
tourism has created 40000 direct and 100000 indirect jobs 
many paying several times the minimum wage of 70 a month 
most new construction is taking place on the north coast a 
sundrenched strip of beaches wedged between a mountain ridge and 
the atlantic ocean that seems a world removed from the crowded 
impoverished capital santo domingo located on the caribbean coast 
four hours away by car 
the playa dorada resort built on a sugar cane field has eight 
hotels with 150 to 400 rooms each four more are under construction 
and another four are in the planning stage 
the town of sosua 10 miles to the east was a sleepy dairy 
community five years ago now 30 hotels are under construction 
dairy farms are being sold to developers and land prices have 
skyrocketed 
a similar boom in tourism and construction is taking place in 
the rest of the caribbean where the number of visitors topped 9 
million for the first time last year up 12 percent from 1986 
jamaica puerto rico and other places have undertaken major 
construction programs and estimates on the number of rooms being 
built right now range up to 20000 
that concerns some tourism officials who wonder where the 
tourists will come from to fill all the rooms after two record 
years in a row the number of visitors to the region this year is 
likely to stabilize at 1987 levels

american business will spend more than 100 billion on travel 
and entertainment by 1990 according to an american express survey 
of business travel management 
by comparison an estimated 85 billion was spent in 1986 which 
american express says is onethird more than business paid in 
taxes the travel expense figure was 2 billion in 1985 
nearly 2500 companies were surveyed and 28 percent responded 
says american express 
according to the survey air travel accounted for the largest 
portion of the travel and entertainment expenses 41 percent of 
every travel dollar lodging 22 percent and meals 17 percent 
were next highest followed by entertainment 14 percent and car 
6 percent 
in the future competition for business customers will focus on 
quality of service according to american express travel management 
services 
the competition for business customers is going to be won on 
quality of service not price as travel vendors respond to a high 
level of consumer discontent and focus on service issues said 
tomasso zanzotto president of travel management services in a 
1988 business travel forecast 
brian froehlich of american express travel management services 
says theres a definite interest in delivering high quality 
service to companies and their travelers we understand that 
quality is directly related to our success 
a recent booklet from the american society of travel agents a 
trade association reminded customers to plan ahead and ask 
questions of their travel agents what is included in the price 
what restrictions apply on discounted fare travel what about 
passports and foreign currency 
travelmasters a chicagobased agency is among those who have 
created information services to help customers make decisions 
the agency has a travel line for special and last minute details 
for leisure travel customers and fare update a monthly newsletter 
for corporate travelers and a travelmaster market pack containing 
travel costs tour information maps and weather information 
as our business has become more computerized says agency 
executive peggy blitz its more important than ever that we give 
meaningful service to each other 
in another report runzheimer international said business travel 
prices rose sharply during 1987 increasing by 165 percent over 
the previous year runzheimer is a consulting firm based in 
rochester wis 
the reason for the big increase is due mostly to rising costs 
in air travel said brad burris executive vice president the 
airlines tightened restrictions for travelers in 1987 making 
discount fares less available than in the past therefore business 
travelers had difficulty fitting their schedules around the 
available low fare flights 
air fares rose 305 percent during the year according to 
runzheimer

a proposal by two of the nations biggest cable 
television concerns to pay about 155 billion for the cable 
systems of the former storer communications follows a bigger 
consortiums abortive proposal to buy the properties at a higher 
price 
comcast corp and telecommunications inc announced sunday they 
had a definitive agreement to acquire sci holdings the company 
formed when storer was taken private by the investment firm 
kohlberg kravis amp roberts in a 25 billion leveraged buyout in 
1985 
sci last year sold its six television stations for about 14 
billion leaving it with cable television systems serving about 
148 million subscribers in 12 states in the east and south 
the acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and other 
conditions 
comcast and telecommunications both members of the consortium 
that proposed and later dropped a plan to acquire sci for about 
29 billion earlier this year 
sci said in december it had gotten a letter of intent for the 
acquisition by the consortium which included comcast american 
television and communications corp which is owned by time inc 
and taft cable partners a partnership of telecommunications and 
texas investor robert m bass 
that proposal was for an acquisition of scis 212 million common 
shares at between 925 and 975 apiece plus the acquisition of 
preferred stock and 24 billion in debt 
but the deal fell through in february when the consortium 
attempted to cut the purchase price john malone president of 
telecommunications contended that sci had made inaccurate 
representations that were disclosed during the course of the deal 
prompting the group to seek a price reduction 
comcast and telecommunications did not provide details of the 
proposed acquisition in a news release and telephone calls sunday 
to spokespeople at comcast headquarters in bala cynwyd pa and 
telecommunications headquarters in denver were unanswered sci 
offices in miami were closed sunday 
sci did state that it estimated the purchase price would mean a 
payment of between 4 and 450 for each outstanding warrant of sci 
comcast operates cable systems serving about 135 million 
subscribers plus muzak franchises the company also owns american 
cellular network corp which operates cellular telephone systems 
in new jersey delaware and maryland 
comcast posted a net loss of 94 million in its 1987 fiscal 
year compared with a 1986 profit of 1 million or 3 cents a 
share due to the costs of financing several acquisitions and to 
accounting factors revenue rose to 3092 million from 1308 
million 
telecommunications owns or controls cable systems serving about 
six million subscribers according to industry estimates it also 
owns a 52 percent stake in the operations of the newly merged 
united artists entertainment co which has interests in cable 
television and movie theaters 
telecommunications posted a profit of 56 million or 4 cents 
a share in its 1987 fiscal year down from 723 million or 48 
cents a share the previous year its revenue rose to 17 billion 
from 6457 million 
the company blamed the earnings decline on the costs of 
financing its acquisition of heritage communications inc and costs 
related to its investment in united artists entertainment the 
profit figures included onetime gains of 424 million in 1987 and 
165 million in 1986 from asset sales and a charge of 225 
million in 1986 from settlement of litigation

few hightechnology products are as unwanted 
as used computers and thousands are junked each year in the united 
states but now more than 1 million worth of these hightech 
handmedowns are headed from america to the third world 
since setting up formally in march the global technology 
foundation has received pledges of computer donations worth that 
much and drawn requests for equipment from as far as bangladesh 
and zimbabwe said one of the founders philip friedman 
with the accelerated pace of innovations in research and 
technology a computer generation can last as little as two or 
three years in the united states after that obsolescence sets in 
thousands of outdated computers are stacked in warehouses 
gathering dust thousands more are crushed or melted down still 
others are cannibalized for spare parts 
upset with the waste friedman and two friends in boulder 
colo decided to set up a clearinghouse for diverting the us 
computer glut to developing countries in the third world 
computer experts american businessmen and third world 
specialists laud the idea 
for users in the third world this could leapfrog them into 
the 80s said robert curley chairman of pc distributing inc 
i have never been able to bring myself to throw out perfectly 
good equipment this concept is very exciting to us said curley 
whose illinoisbased company is one of the largest computer 
distributors in the midwest 
he estimated that his companys donations could amount to about 
100000 annually in used computer hardware 
for computer businesses the donations are financially 
beneficial they are a tax deduction and can save thousands of 
dollars in storage costs said friedman 
global technology is asking donors to include manuals with the 
computers and hopes to put together training packages including 
literature and experts for the third world users 
were not just going to dump the stuff and leave them to 
figure it out said friedman 
global technology has received the taxexempt status of a 
charitable foundation and has applied to several foundations for 
grants to fund transportation for the donations and management of 
its projects he said 
gary gaile a geographer who serves on the foundations advisory 
board has worked on a separate project to introduce computers to 
government service in kenya gaile who teaches at the university 
of colorado in boulder said kenyans were thrilled with the 
computers it gave them a rare skill in that society 
he said the kenyan government used to compile its budget 
manually and was almost through the budget year before the 
document was completed with computers the budget is on time 
gaile said 
here its difficult to dump old computers there where 
theyre 10 or 15 years behind these machines are more than 
adequate he said 
the ymca is one of the first in line to receive global 
technologys free computers michael diamond assistant director of 
the organizations international division said most of the ymcas 
in 92 countries run themselves without computers 
this would give them a tremendous chance to improve their 
management he said 
computers would also be useful for the ymcas vocational 
training and remedial programs in african and south american 
countries he said 
computer corporations do contribute some surplus equipment 
overseas but most of the computers go to specific government or 
university projects but the emphasis is on supplying training 
experts rather than equipment 
ibm for example is contributing to 200 projects overseas for 
disaster preparedness planning soil reclamation public health and 
other programs said a company public affairs official linda 
nardin but most of ibms contributionconsists of supplying 
professional advice she added 
global technology is also collecting medical and dental 
equipment agricultural machinery construction machinery 
telephone equipment water testing and purification devices even 
sewing machines are welcome

textile giant jp stevens amp co target of a 
protracted takeover battle has accepted a 12 billion cash offer 
from two buyers after initially rejecting the deal the companies 
involved said today 
the 6850ashare deal will split up the 175yearold fabric 
maker one of the nations largest textile producers and an 
important employer in the southeastern united states 
the major buyer is rival textile producer west point pepperell 
inc which will keep most of stevens sheet and towel operations 
but sell some to another textile producer bibb co of macon ga 
to satisfy previously announced federal antitrust concerns 
odyssey partners a wall street investment firm that had been 
vying with pepperell to buy stevens will get the companys other 
operations including its carpet and industrial fabrics plants for 
about 530 million 
pepperell and odyssey arranged the purchase with stevens after 
an initial 12 billion offer was rejected partly because of the 
target companys concerns about the tentative nature of odysseys 
financing 
the terms were revised over the weekend to stevens 
satisfaction and the deal was accepted 
in early trading on the new york stock exchange stevens rose 25 
cents to 6775 a share 
pepperell has made its bids in conjunction with the ntc group 
parent of bibb under terms of the agreement with stevens the 
pepperell group will acquire the entire company for 6850 a share 
under a tender offer that will expire at midnight edt may 6 unless 
extended 
odyssey will then purchase its portion of the the stevens assets 
from pepperell but if pepperell cannot complete its end of the 
deal odyssey has agreed to purchase stevens subject to financing 
odysseys outstanding 6850ashare tender offer has been extended 
to may 20 
pepperells interest in stevens has centered exclusively on the 
companys sheet and towel operations which include manufacturing 
facilities as well as designer brand names those operations 
account for 60 percent of stevens annual sales which amounted to 
161 billion last year 
among the top brand names in stevens towel and sheet arsenal 
are ralph lauren laura ashley gloria vanderbilt perry ellis 
pierre cardin and givenchy among others pepperells brands 
include arrow martex lady pepperell and burberry 
headquartered in new york stevens employs more than 23000 
people 
the takeover maneuvering for the company began earlier this year 
when management offered to buy it for 765 million 
pepperell and odyssey went three rounds in a heated bidding 
contest before announcing last week that they would work together 
to draft a joint buyout proposal

rig count went with it dropping to 663 the lowest since hughes 
began compiling figures

about 3000 black autoworkers 
returned to work monday after staging a 10day strike in defiance 
of their union to protest divestment arrangements made by ford 
motor co 
the wildcat strike began april 15 at the south african motor 
corps main plant in pretoria the company known as samcor said 
its entire paidbythehour workforce joined the strike and the 
production loss was estimated at between 1800 to 2000 vehicles 
the workers were protesting an agreement signed last year by 
ford samcor and the national union of metalworkers under which 
ford donated the bulk of its minority holding in samcor to a trust 
administered by the workers 
the trust was intended to fund development projects in the 
communities where the workers live but the workers maintain they 
should receive the dividends directly 
according to an industry source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity the strikers decided to resume work while negotiations 
with the union continued to resolve the dispute over the dividends 
the union had no immediate comment on the matter 
prior to its disinvestment late last year ford owned 42 percent 
of samcor the corporation was formed in 1985 when ford and anglo 
american corp south africas largest conglomerate merged their 
south african auto operations

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether exxon company usa a division of exxon corp waited too 
long in seeking to collect on a 195 million standby letter of 
credit in a contract dispute with a houston oil company 
the justices said they will use the case to decide a procedural 
point on the relationship of federal and state court rulings in 
cases based on state law 
standby letters of credit are common in the business world they 
are issued by banks to assure the prompt payment of money to one 
signer of a contract if the other signer fails to live up to the 
contracts terms 
the bank issuing such a letter of credit is required to make 
payment only if it is presented with specified documents within a 
specified time 
exxon in 1981 contracted with houston oil amp refining inc to 
make reciprocal deliveries of crude oil 
exxon agreed to ship 558000 barrels of oil to houston oil 
during july 1981 and houston oil agreed to ship an equal quantity 
of oil to exxon from september through december of that year 
houston oil was issued a 193 million standby letter of credit 
by banque de paris et des paysbas paribas that said 193 
million would be payable upon certification that houston oil failed 
to deliver the promised oil between september and december 1981 
but the certification had to be presented to paribas not later 
than october 1981 an inconsistency with the contracts terms 
exxon which delivered 558000 barrels of oil to houston oil in 
july 1981 learned sometime in november 1981 that houston oil would 
not be delivering any oil to it 
exxon requested payment from paribas on the letter of credit but 
the bank refused contending that exxons request was too late 
exxon sued in federal court even though its lawsuit alleging 
the wrongful dishonor of a letter of credit was based on texas 
contract law exxon could do that socalled diversity 
jurisdiction rules because paribas is not based in texas 
a federal trial judge ruled for exxon but the 5th us circuit 
court of appeals last oct 8 reversed that ruling we find that 
the obligation of the issuing bank had terminated even though it 
might not have been possible to present to the bank the documents 
required for payment bvefore the expiry date the appeals court 
said 
while exxons request for a rehearing was pending before the 5th 
circuit court a texas appeals court ruled in a very similar case 
that under such circumstances a letter of credits expiration date 
is unenforceable 
in the appeal acted on today exxon is asking the justices to 
rule that the federal appeals court faced with a clearer 
definition of state law should set aside its october ruling and 
reconsider the case in light of the state courts intepretation of 
texas law 
lawyers for paribas argued that the 5th circuit courts ruling 
was based on wellsettled principles of texas law and should 
not be reviewed 
the case is exxon company usa vs banque de paris et des 
paysbas 871467

ibm corp shareholders today defeated a 
proposal that would have forced the computer giant to stop selling 
its products in racially segregated south africa

aggressive against competitors 
if we have learned anything during the past few years we have 
learned that our industry the information industry is a 
volatile one and ibm is subject to that volatility akers said

in the beginning mankind traded goods 
themselves a bushel of grain in exchange for a cow or a pelt in 
trade for a weapon 
as skills developed and trade expanded it became easier to use 
mediums of exchange analogs such as metals or beads or other 
things prized for their beauty or rarity 
and then we created coins which substituted for the beautiful 
or rare precious objects that had substituted earlier for the 
actual products being traded and then we invented checks which 
substituted for cash 
all these were great steps forward and of course they portended 
even greater changes to come but marketplace evolution apparently 
isnt a steady ascent in sophistication weve been stalled ever 
since 
which in a fashion is prelude to the question of what ever 
happened to the cashless society and its cousin the checkless 
society twenty years ago they appeared imminent the leaders of 
technology said so 
instead of the customer handling cash the bank would 
electronically adjust the customers balance transferring funds to 
the accounts of creditors named by the customer less need for 
cash and almost no need for checks 
while embraced by industry the checkless and cashless society 
gained no more acceptance among consumers than the picturephone or 
ordering products by electronic computer 
a good idea perhaps but not just yet while advocates swear 
their time is coming they concede that at the moment mankind seems 
to have achieved a level of marketplace sophistication that suits 
consumers fine 
a study made at the federal reserve bank of san francisco shows 
that cash and checks will be around for a while more it found that 
57 percent of families pay by check 36 percent by cash and only 7 
percent by credit cards 
there are more dollars in the hands of the public now than ever 
before says the banks michael keely and the total is growing 
fast rising to 200 billion in 1987 from 148 billion in 1983 
why do we like to keep dealing in cash 
its convenient says keeley and almost everyone is likely to 
agree it takes less time to handle than a check or credit card it 
often costs less to pay by cash and cash is direct and 
uncomplicated thus highly acceptable 
even automatic tellers those impersonal machines stationed in 
bank lobbies and reception areas prefer cash they are even more 
rudimentary than the least sophisticated consumers they cannot 
deal with checks 
the banks that employ the automatic tellers are just as 
insistent on cash since banks can process money exchange old 
bills for new at the fed without charge whereas they pay a fee 
for the feds checkprocessing services 
why should people prefer checks to automatic electronic 
payments among the possibilities better recordkeeping more 
personal control and a greater variety of options such as who to 
pay first and when and how much 
but beneath all these obvious explanations is one that may apply 
to a host of electronic devices that have been proposed over the 
past two decades a feeling that theyre not fully understood and 
especially not even needed

shareholders of firestone tire and rubber co 
have voted overwhelmingly in favor of the 26 billion buyout by 
bridgestone corp of japan firestone chairman john j nevin said 
today 
the japanese tiremakers 80ashare offer was supported by 993 
percent of the 58 percent of shareholders who voted on the 
question said nevin who announced the outcome at a special 
shareholders meeting this morning 
bridgestones tender offer expires tuesday and the acquisition 
could become effective wednesday nevin said 
approval of the bridgestone offer comes on the heels of general 
motors corps announcement that it would drop firestone as a tire 
supplier for its vehicles 
nevin would not speculate on why gm made the decision 
to a japanese company the long term is considerably more 
important well look at this as anything one has to deal with in 
the business world and decide what path the company has to take in 
the future said bridgestone spokesman dennis allen 
gm spokesman james crellin said the automakers action was part 
of our rationalization study which is a periodic review of 
capacity and future needs of suppliers 
crellin declined to discuss how long the phaseout of firestone 
tires would take or discuss the amount of business gm does with its 
suppliers 
weve got four other tire suppliers general tire goodyear 
michelin and uniroyalgoodrich crellin said there are no 
plans to look for another supplier at this time we will be 
informing the other four tire suppliers of the availability of 
increased business 
nevin said in a statement issued saturday that he was 
surprised and disappointed by gms move but said firestone is 
confident it will find other markets for its tires without hurting 
profits 
firestones statement offered no reason for gms action but the 
company said it was advised by bridgestone that the action will 
have no effect on the 80ashare buyout offer 
firestone said the phaseout would occur over two years 
estimates in the trade publication modern tire dealer show that 
gm buys about 34 percent of its tires from uniroyalgoodrich 
making it gms largest tire supplier goodyear is second at 225 
percent firestone third with 20 percent general tire fourth at 
175 percent and michelin fifth at 45 percent 
firestone moved its corporate headquarters in november from 
akron ohio to chicago it operates four us plants with 1400 
employees at its main plant in akron 
firestone agreed to be acquired in march by bridgestone after 
an unsolicited takeover bid by italys pirelli spa 
kimball firestone a firestone board member and grandson of 
firestone founder harvey s firestone said he did not know what 
bridgestone planned to do after the takeover but he did not 
foresee shakeups in the companys top management 
i think it is tight he said of firestones corporate 
leadership structure i have an impression bridgestone plans to 
leave top management but its their call 
he said it also seemed logical to leave the headquarters for 
firestones north american tiremaking operation in akron 
firestone is the nations secondlargest tiremaker after 
goodyear tire amp rubber co with tires accounting for nearly 70 
percent of its 42 billion in annual sales

the securities and exchange commission said 
monday it was delaying by two months the effective date of a rule 
designed to make it easier for investors to shop for mutual funds

yield is not computed according to sec standards

than anticipated 
the soybean complex had led the grain markets higher in early

soybean meal but with the expectation downstream for poor 
domestic use and export the market couldnt hold said richard 
loewy senior grain and oilseed analyst for prudentialbache

the soybean market also sold off on expectations that the weekly 
us department of agrigulture export inspections report would show 
8 million to 11 million bushels of soybeans were approved for 
shipment last week but the report issued after the close showed 
soybean inspections totaled more than 131 million bushels

workers with their sights set on moving up in the 
business world may do better in eyeglasses says a new study that 
found corporate recruiters look favorably on the bespectacled 
the survey conducted by the dallasbased pearle vision center 
found 79 percent of the corporate recruiters and fashionimage 
consultants queried said that glasses connote intelligence 
sixtynine percent said they viewed glasses as enhancing a 
professional image 
joseph dono pearles senior vice president of marketing said 
monday that the survey doesnt necessarily mean the 2020 set 
should rush to buy glasses but it could be a consideration for 
those who need corrective lenses 
eyeglasses are not only functional for vision correction but 
they also make a statement about the individual wearing them 
dono said todays consumer may purchase glasses as a fashion 
accessory or to project a more businesslike image for that board 
room look 
pearle researchers interviewed 100 corporate recruiters and 
image consultants in new york chicago los angeles and san 
francisco about 60 percent of those polled recruit either for 
executivelevel positions or for the financial or communications 
field 
the survey reported 80 percent of the respondents think 
eyeglasses help the wearer focus on making a power statement during 
a business presentation 
removing glasses at strategic points is considered an effective 
way to emphasize a particular word or phrase a third of those 
surveyed admitted using glasses for such a purpose 
its an eyeopener to people who are buying eyeglasses 
today dono said many people who are buying glasses today 
havent bought eyewear in about two years everything has changed 
since then the materials are running the gamut from plastic to 
metal to carbon a very light metal titanium and then there are 
cosmetic tints available on the lenses and lightweight plastic 
lenses 
the poll showed the best choice for the work environment for 
both men and women is the the classic tortoiseshell frame style 
which for years has suggested a studious bookworm image for 
the wearer 
the secondmost popular styles with recruiters on men were wire 
frames while ultramodern designer frames ranked second for women 
applicants 
it may seem ironic that the survey favors wearing glasses at a 
time when contact lenses have advanced to include not only hard and 
soft lenses but also gaspermeable extendedwear and 
eyecolorchanging lenses 
not everyone can wear contacts and many people do not like to 
wear contacts dono said 
the fact that there are designer labels and quality brands 
isnt enough of an attraction for everyone dono said but 
amongst people who have to wear glasses the choices are more 
appealing today than they were five years ago 
dono said there may be some upwardly mobile businesstypes who 
will begin wearing eyeglasses even if they dont need them because 
of poor vision 
there are some people who will and already do wear them for 
that reason but thats a small minority dono said i mean 
many people wear sunglasses not for the effects on they have on 
cutting out sunlight but because the people think they look good

major us oil companies led by topranking 
exxon corp and secondlargest mobil corp reported strong 
improvements in their firstquarter earnings monday many citing 
sharp gains in refining and marketing as well as chemicals 
amoco corp occidental petroleum corp and unocal corp also 
reported hefty increases 
exxon said its earnings were up 36 percent to 146 billion or 
106 per share compared with 107 billion or 75 cents per 
share in the 1987 first quarter sales totaled 220 billion vs 
194 billion a year earlier it said 
mobil said its quarterly profit doubled to 505 million or 
123 per share compared with 252 million or 62 cents per share 
in the 1987 period revenue from continuing operations totaled 
138 billion vs 117 billion in the first three months of last 
year 
both companies are based in new york 
among the others 
amoco of chicago said its earnings leaped 804 percent to 
469 million or 182 per share vs 1987 firstquarter earnings 
of 260 million or 102 per share sales totaled 58 billion in 
the first three months compared with 52 billion in the 1987 
period the nations fifthlargest petroleum company said 
occidental ranked seventh said its earnings increased by 165 
percent to 113 million or 52 cents per share compared with 97 
million or 50 cents per share a year earlier both periods 
included extraordinary gains however 
the los angelesbased company said its sales totaled 448 
billion in the three months compared with 416 billion in the 
1987 first quarter 
unocal said its earnings nearly tripled but were also affected 
by special items the company ranked 13thlargest is also 
headquartered in los angeles 
unocals quarterly earnings totaled 1784 million or 153 per 
share on 23 billion of revenue vs 607 billion or 52 cents 
per share on sales of 206 billion in the same period of 1987 
included in those results were a 456 million onetime gain due 
to an accounting change related to income taxes this was partially 
offset by an posttax charge of 322 million for a writedown of 
certain company assets the company said 
excess supplies and weak winter demand associated with 
warmerthannormal weather caused crude prices to move sharply 
lower during the quarter crude prices in last years first quarter 
were higher and relatively stable observed exxon chairman lg 
rawl 
the sharply lower crude prices together with much stronger 
margins for petroleum products and record chemical earnings were 
fundamentally responsible for exxons overall earnings 
improvement he added 
the quarterly comparison was helped by sale of property abroad 
and lower incentive compensation costs in 1988 but the effect of 
these benefits was largely offset by the absence of 1987 foreign 
exchange gains and tax credits associated with foreign 
operations rawl said 
mobil chairman allen e murray said the companys quarterly 
performance was the best since 1981 with the most important 
improvements occurring in its domestic refining and marketing 
segment and chemicals which posted its best quarter ever 
the latest report did not reflect the impact of mobils 
montgomery ward unit which was sold on march 7 mobil said the 
retailer made 19 million in profits compared with 8 million in 
the first quarter of 1987 those profits and proceeds from the sale 
will be posted in the second quarter the company said 
amoco chairman richard m morrow attributed the companys 
performance to substantial strengthening of refined product 
margins compared with the same period last year along with 
continued record earnings by its chemicals division 
in los angeles occidental chairman armand hammer said chemical 
operations more than tripled during the quarter 
the company said its 1988 results included an aftertax gain of 
53 million primarily from the sale of a 25 percent interest in 
its colombia oil holdings as well as extraordinary gains of 2 
million primarily from capital loss carryforwards 
its 1987 firstquarter results included a posttax gain of 103 
million from the sale of certain chemical operations plus 24 
million in capital loss carryforwards 
fred l hartley unocals chairman said the main negative 
factors affecting quarterly performance were higher dry hole costs 
and exploratory expense and lower geothermal earnings and domestic 
crude prices 
these were offset somewhat by higher natural gas production in 
thailand and higher refining and marketing profits he added 
the writedowns included unocals remaining investment in a shale 
oil project about half its investment in mining and processing 
facilities in new mexico and pennsylvania and 40 percent of its 
investment in certain coking facilities at its chicago refinery

the head of american telephone amp telegraph cos 
computer products division is leaving to rejoin the office 
equipment giant ing c olivetti spa of italy atampt announced 
monday 
vittorio cassoni who had been head of olivettis north american 
operations before joining atampt in 1986 will be nominated as 
managing director of the italian company atampt said in a statement 
robert m kavner atampts chief financial officer was named to 
replace cassoni as president of the companys data systems group 
the announcement came a week after robert e allen succeeded 
james e olson as atampt chairman olson who had headed the 
telecommunications giant since september 1986 died of cancer 
cassoni 45 joined atampt after the american company and olivetti 
signed a 10year agreement under which olivetti began to produce 
personal computers for both firms 
wall street analysts said they did not know whether cassonis 
departure was being planned before olsons death although allen 
said in a statement when we brought vittorio to atampt in 1986 it 
was understood that he would eventually return to olivetti 
no one knows the answer to that said john bain who tracks 
atampt for the investment firm shearson lehman hutton inc im 
tempted to say it must have been they wouldnt undertake something 
at this high level at a whim 
olivetti was disappointed recently by atampts refusal to increase 
its 23 percent stake in the italian company but bain said it was 
not known if there was a connection between that event and 
cassonis resignation 
analysts also said it was too early to tell what effect the 
change might have on the data systems group which is responsible 
for the development and marketing of atampts computer products 
it is a loss thomas mckeever an analyst at first boston 
corp said of cassonis departure 
however mckeever added a good chunk of his work is behind 
they have laid the foundation and gotten a dedicated sales force 
bain noting cassonis overhaul of atampts national marketing 
system said if he has gotten things turned about this could 
be viewed as a very positive step but he said we dont 
know 
under cassoni the data systems group agreed to develop a new 
version of atampts unix computer with sun microsystems inc atampt has 
also agreed to acquire a stake of up to 20 percent in sun 
the data systems group is currently vying for a 45 billion 
contract to supply 20000 computers to the air force and other 
defense agencies digital equipment corp and wang laboratories 
inc dropped out of the bidding recently claiming the deal favored 
atampt 
bain said the data systems position could be a testing ground 
for kavner 
if he can be a general purpose executive rather than just an 
accountant there could be higher things in the cards down the 
road bain said 
kavner 44 joined atampt in 1984 after 10 years as a partner at 
coopers amp lybrand the accounting and consulting firm

capital citiesabc inc said monday its first 
quarter profit nearly tripled despite a wider loss at its abc 
television network 
the communications giant warned that its business outlook for 
the rest of the year is not as encouraging however because of 
anticipated weak advertising demand for the television network and 
specialized publications 
capital cities said it earned 703 million or 416 a share 
in the three months ended april 4 compared with 239 million or 
143 a share a year earlier 
first quarter revenue rose 34 percent to 129 billion from 959 
million a year earlier 
on an operating basis income rose 722 percent to 167 million 
in the quarter from 973 million in 1987 
broadcasting revenue which includes revenue for the companys 
eight television stations 21 radio stations and its 80 percent 
interest in the espn cable network as well as for the abc 
television network rose 44 percent to 104 billion mainly due to 
the 1988 telecasts of the super bowl football game and the winter 
olympics games 
operating income in broadcasting rose 86 percent to 1644 
million from 88 million a year earlier 
nonetheless the abc television network reported a 
significantly increased loss in the quarter the company did 
not provide a specific loss figure for either period the network 
earned 50 million in all of 1987 
the company said continuing cost control efforts and income from 
the telecast of the super bowl by the network failed to offset a 
loss in excess of 65 million from the broadcast of the winter 
olympics 
the network spent about 350 million for the rights to the games 
and production of the telecast but generated only about 285 
million in revenue according to spokesman joseph fitzgerald 
the company said operating earnings for the companys television 
stations and espn were well ahead of last year 
publishing revenue rose 4 percent to 246 million but 
publishing earnings declined 175 percent to 287 million 
the company said there were modest revenue gains in the 
newspaper and shopping guide operations partly offset by weakness 
in specialized publications

the dollar ended mixed in light trading monday 
reflecting dealer reluctance to speculate prior to potentially 
marketmoving developments later this week 
gold prices fell marginally after rising in europe and falling 
in asia republic national bank quoted bullion at 44750 a troy 
ounce as of 4 pm edt compared with 44950 late friday 
money dealers attributed the dollars mixed behavior partly to 
uncertainty about the impact of a government report on 
firstquarter us economic growth due out tuesday 
they also said the senates impending vote on a major trade 
bill along with questions about the outcome of a planned opec 
meeting with noncartel oil exporters injected uncertainty into 
foreign exchange trading 
theres not much to say today said christianne mandell a 
trading analyst at the new york branch of britains barclays bank 
plc it was quiet because theres anticipation about events that 
are happening later until those things come out there wont be 
information to trade on 
traders said the commerce departments report on the gross 
national product would be a tricky number to interpret estimates 
range between 15 percent and 3 percent but it will be the 
underlying components of that figure that influence the dollars 
value 
for example if firstquarter gnp is high that could boost the 
dollar provided that the growth was caused by strength in exports 
thereby helping reduce the trade deficit but if the growth was 
caused by strong consumer demand for foreign goods that suggests 
higher imports a widening trade deficit and a further decline in 
the dollar 
on the other hand a substantially lower gnp could boost the 
dollar because it implies a slowdown in imports but it also could 
hurt the dollar by relieving pressure for higher domestic interest 
rates traders said 
its really a catch22 situation said alberto soria 
foreign exchange manager at the new york branch of swiss bank corp 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day 
begins the dollar rose 035 yen to a closing 12500 yen in london 
it retreated to 12460 yen and in new york it traded at 12473 
yen down from 12491 yen late friday 
the british pound fell in london to 18730 cheaper than the 
18880 reached friday largely because of weekend remarks by 
britains chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson that sterling 
shouldnt rise further in new york the pound fetched 18736 
cheaper than 18840 quoted friday 
other late dollar rates in new york compared with levels late

chicago said he expected demand for copper to weaken further as 
summer approaches

from shoes to machines the soviet economy had 
trouble meeting the countrys needs in the first three months of 
this year the government said monday in a sobering report on 
mikhail s gorbachevs reforms 
perhaps the most telling admission in the lengthy report was 
that national income the overall barometer of the countrys 
economic health fell 26 percentage points short of the planned 
level 
national income went up 4 percent over the first quarter of 
1987 whereas the plan called for an increase of 66 percent the 
same shortfall was reported in labor productivity 
the first quarter of 1987 to which the new figures are being 
compared was marred by overall poor performance 
now its important for everything designated not to remain 
only on paper the council of ministers the governments 
cabinet said monday in reviewing the economic report 
the council stressed that many of the economys bottlenecks were 
hurting the countrys 2852 million people 
the shortcomings noted in the work of a series of industries 
and complexes became serious brakes in the buildup of production 
and increase in peoples wellbeing the council said according 
to the news agency tass 
the report covered a period in which a new system was introduced 
in the soviet economy as of jan 1 more than 76000 staterun 
factories and farms responsible for 60 percent of the soviet 
unions production were required to depend on themselves for the 
revenue they need to operate 
that is one of the key elements of gorbachevs economic reforms 
aimed at giving local managers more responsibility and flexibility 
the communist party chief wants to limit central authorities to 
overall planning of the economy and allow local managers to 
exercise direct control over production plans and quotas 
the media said the reforms were not to blame for the 
shortcomings noted in the report industries and farms operating 
under the new requirements are performing better than those 
working in the old way radio moscow said 
industrial production increased 5 percent over the first quarter 
of 1987 exceeding the 45 percent target set in state plans radio 
moscow quoted nikolai belov deputy head of the state committee on 
statistics as saying 
energy production transportation equipment computers and 
medical equipment all grew strongly the statistics said 
but onethird of the machinebuilding industry a key sector in 
gorbachevs drive for greater efficiency did not complete its 
orders the council of ministers noted 
among the specific problems cited in the report splashed over 
two pages of the government newspaper izvestia were shortcomings 
in consumer products it sais 87000 radio receivers 44000 
washing machines and 44000 vacuum cleaners called for in state 
plans were not produced clothing and shoes were either in short 
supply or were left unpurchased because they were oldfashioned or 
of poor quality 
in agriculture meat vegetable and dairy production failed to 
satisfy peoples needs and in some areas bread quality and 
assortment was poor the report said 
of the 15 soviet republics armenia had the worst record from 
january to march for fulfillment of industrial contract 
obligations armenian factories completed just 985 percent of 
their orders compared to a high of 999 percent for byelorussia 
and latvia 
the report also criticized armenia for not raising workers 
salaries improving household services or building schools 
hospitals and cultural centers 
during much of february many of armenias factories schools 
and businesses were closed in a strike prompted by an ethnic 
dispute 
the report was released as us intelligence agencies released 
in washington an assessment saying that gorbachevs reforms ran 
into serious obstacles in 1987 
a joint report by the central intelligence agency and the 
defense intelligence agency said the soviet gross national product 
increased only 05 percent in 1987 compared with a 39 percent 
increase the previous year 
it said the poor performance in 1987 was due to poor weather 
that hurt farm production and resistance to change in the soviet 
bureaucracy 
national income the barometer the soviets use is a measurement 
of economic activity that differs from gross national product 
because it does not consider the value of some services

senators traded lastminute sales pitches 
monday as they fought for votes on a sweeping trade bill advancing 
in defiance of presidential veto threats 
you let this bill go down the tubes and ill tell you where 
the champagne corks will be popping theyll be popping in japan 
and theyll be popping in germany said senate finance committee 
chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas 
the bill scheduled for a senate vote on tuesday or wednesday 
was expected to pass with votes to spare and the major question 
remaining was whether it would get enough support to override a 
veto 
its close bentsen told reporters 
democrats were expected to back the measure overwhelmingly while 
republicans were divided 
the administration and its supporters said a veto would not 
finish off the issue for the year and that there still would be 
time to pass a strippeddown version that deleted the most 
controversial provisions 
i know this is an election year and the majority party may be 
looking for a campaign issue rather than a trade bill but i am 
confident the congress could pass a better bill if this one is 
rejected said sen robert t stafford dvt 
the house passed the 1000page measure on thursday 312107 
more than enough support to override president reagans threatened 
veto 
over the last month the administration has focused most of its 
criticism on a provision that would require all but the smallest 
employers to provide 60day notice of plant closings and 
largescale layoffs 
a number of business groups have campaigned against the measure 
saying it would dry up capital for investment frighten off 
customers and cause other problems for management 
basic provisions of the bill would overhaul the system under 
which the united states imposes import curbs in retaliation for 
international trade violations and other unfair practices 
among other things it would make retaliation mandatory for 
violations except in certain cases such as national security 
it also would transfer from the president to the us trade 
representative the authority to determine whether retaliation was 
in order and if so what kind of sanctions to impose 
other central features would streamline the machinery under 
which the united states imposes import quotas and tariffs to aid 
american industries that are threatened by surges in foreign 
competition 
the measure contains scores of other features ranging from 
billions of dollars in agricultural subsidies to repeal of the 
windfall profits tax on earnings of oil companies

a state judge tentatively approved on monday a 
proposed 55 million settlement of ohios lawsuit against arthur 
andersen amp co accounting firm for the collapsed home state 
savings bank 
judge richard a niehaus of hamilton county common pleas court 
said he would accept objections to the proposed settlement and make 
a final ruling on may 6 
the state blamed the firm for negligence in auditing home 
states books which ohio officials said contributed to the march 
1985 collapse of the cincinnatibased thrift arthur andersen 
denied the states allegations and admitted no wrongdoing in 
reaching the settlement 
the settlement was reached april 15 after the case already had 
gone to trial in the ohio court of claims in columbus the case is 
before niehaus because he has jurisdiction over the states 
liquidation of home state 
the case is one of numerous civil suits the state filed in its 
efforts to recover costs of guaranteeing all the deposits of home 
state after its collapsed home state was closed for three months 
until another company bought and reopened it in june 1985 allowing 
depositors to get their money back 
home state collapsed three days after the us securities and 
exchange commission had esm government securities inc a 
securities trader in fort lauderdale fla closed for bankruptcy 
with more than 300 million in debts home state was esms biggest 
investor through securities transactions and lost 144 million 
because of esms closing 
home states failure caused a statewide crisis for 69 other ohio 
savings and loans insured by the private ohio deposit guarantee 
fund of cincinnati which was weakened when home state drained 
backup money to cope with losses and withdrawals by panicked 
depositors 
a number of home state and esm have since been convicted of 
crimes in connection with the failure of the two institutions

an omnibus trade bill that president reagan has 
promised to veto could be revised easily to his liking with its 
major provisions intact the chairman of the us international 
trade commission said monday 
i think youre a bit premature in calling in the undertaker 
susan liebeler told fellow panalists discussing the bill the issue 
was raised at the 102nd annual convention of the american newspaper 
publishers association here 
the trade bill passed the house by 312107 last week and is to 
be voted on by the senate this week 
reagan objects to a provision requiring most manufacturers to 
give 60 days notice of plant closings and major layoffs 
liebeler said she thought that reagan would veto the bill and 
that in a revised version the notification provision would be 
dropped and the bill approved 
you may in fact see a trade bill the administration will 
sign she said 
the other panalists were makoto kuroda vice minister for 
international affairs in japans ministry of international trade 
and industry pat choate vice president for policy at trw inc 
and william h davidson an associate professor at the university 
of southern californias school of business administration 
the japanese government has urged reagan to veto the bill which 
would punish toshiba corp for a subsidiarys sale of sensitive 
equipment to the soviet union and give the us trade 
representative more power to deal with complaints of unfair trade 
practices by foreign countries 
the panalists were divided on the bill with kuroda voicing 
opposition and choate and davidson supporting it 
the flip side of the trade issue choate said was foreign 
investment in the united states an issue he said the federal 
government was illequipped to handle because it did not keep an 
accurate count of money invested by foreigners 
how can we have a good policy without good information 
choate asked 
kuroda said japans investment in the united states would help 
revitalize the economys of both countries and provide for 
technological transfer 
the discussion called international trade is protectionism 
dead was moderated by karen elliot house foreign editor of the 
wall street journal 
the panel was the first group discussion in the threeday 
convention which began monday 
more than 2000 people including about 1500 publishers who 
represent 90 percent of the daily newspaper circulation in the 
united states are attending
