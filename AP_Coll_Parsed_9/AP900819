for perhaps the first time in a century 
north american indians have taken up arms against the white man and 
won an important battle 
the war is far from over but the lesson from the sixweek 
confrontation between mohawks and the forces of law and order seems 
to be that violence and militancy get public attention and public 
attention leads to action 
the situation has evolved considerably since july 11 when the 
provincial police launched an illadvised attack on a small group 
of mohawk militants blocking a road through kanesatake reserve at 
oka just west of montreal on the st lawrence river 
the police were repulsed and an officer was killed though it is 
still unclear by whom 
to the south of montreal in the bedroom community of 
chateauguay mohawks from the kahnawake reserve set up a sympathy 
blockade shutting down the mercier bridge vital to commuters who 
work in the city 
since then there has been a steady war of nerves growing anger 
on the part of frustrated south shore residents three nights of 
rioting last week and onagain offagain talks 
on thursday serious negotiations finally got under way and the 
army began preparations over the weekend to replace the weary 
police on the barricades 
ostensibly the fuss was over the village of okas plan to 
expand its ninehole golf course on land the indians claim is 
theirs including a sacred burial ground the golf course question 
was resolved when the federal government agreed to purchase the 
land and turn it over to the mohawks 
but the land claim issue is much wider and much more complicated 
here and it goes far beyond the mohawks at kanesatake and 
kahnawake 
any outcome at oka short of a bloodbath will send a powerful 
message to native people across canada whose grievances far 
outweigh those of kanesatake wrote university of toronto 
historian desmond morton 
even the massive land claims settlement in the western arctic 
proudly announced last spring is now in a state of collapse while 
native leaders wait to see whether oka tactics produce better 
terms 
ojibwa indians in ontario jumped on the bandwagon and cut all 
eastwest rail traffic to support their land claims one band set 
up a blockade at longlac and another group cut rail traffic east of 
white river north of lake superior however authorities said 
sunday that the longlac group had agreed to end their blockade 
there are thousands of indian land claims pending before the 
federal government covering about twothirds of canadas 
territory the government actively processes only six at a time and 
typically settlements take 20 years or more 
quebec premier robert bourassa who called on the army for help 
seems to have only two options neither of them good 
he can again try to dislodge the indians by force in front of a 
worldwide television audience and international observers or he 
can surrender to the pressure and negotiate with guntoting 
militants who clearly have broken the law he has opted for the 
second 
the situation on the ground now is being watched by 24 observers 
from the parisbased international federation of human rights the 
negotiation process has been sealed off 
the quebec public was horrified last week when it saw a federal 
minister a provincial minister and a judge sit down with armed 
masked indians to sign a document on a format for talks 
the image remains indelible 
did you see that scene here with the ministers lamented 
yvan patry mayor of oka parish which surrounds both the village 
of oka and the kanesatake reserve 
both sides in the conflict have clammed up since the beginning 
of talks they say they have agreed not to speak about the 
negotiations not even what is on the agenda 
tom siddon the federal minister of indian affairs claims that 
promises to reopen land claim talks with the mohawks have nothing 
to do with the blockades in oka and chateauguay 
i dont in any way agree with any suggestion that we have 
agreed to negotiate in the face of guns said siddon we will 
not 
appearances however are to the contrary 
the kanesatake reserve is a patchwork of indian territory with 
pieces separated by privately owned land there had been earlier 
talks about finding a way to join up the various patches of mohawk 
land 
what the federal and provincial governments clearly fear is 
setting a dangerous precedent 
blockades will not result in any band being allowed to jump 
the queue in the claims process the minister vowed 
one thing is certain the barricades will come down one day 
soon and it appears likely that the band of mohawk warriors who 
held off the forces of the white man will walk away with their 
heads held high and an inspiration for their brothers elsewhere 
and that is perhaps the biggest concern of the canadian 
authorities

us warships fired the first shots by american forces in the 
persian gulf crisis in an unsuccessful effort to halt two iraqi 
tankers and iraq said thousands of foreign captives will suffer 
first if a us blockade curtails food 
iraqs threat which singled out foreign babies and elderly 
people was immediately denounced by the white house as an illegal 
use of innocent civilians as pawns in the middle east standoff 
the un security council late saturday unanimously demanded 
that iraq let all foreigners leave and that baghdad take no 
action to jeopardize the safety security or health of such 
nationals 
 
iraqs statement coupled with an earlier threat to use 
americans and other foreigners as a defensive shield for iraqi 
military installations made it clear the foreigners have become a 
central part of iraqs antius strategy 
iraq said saturday it had begun moving some of the foreigners to 
strategic locations around the country 
in washington the pentagon said the uss reid fired six warning 
shots across the bow of the iraqi ship khanaqin in the gulf of oman 
after it refused repeated requests to halt 
the shots were the first fired in the 2dayold interdiction 
effort ordered by president bush to halt goods leaving and entering 
iraq 
also the uss bradley fired three warning shots across the bow 
of another iraqi tanker to the north in the persian gulf and headed 
toward the gulf of oman the pentagon said 
the persian gulf which connects with the gulf of oman is 
iraqs outlet to the sea 
both tankers are currently under way but are under close us 
navy surveillance the pentagon said a pentagon source who spoke 
on condition of anonymity said navy ships were unlikely to take 
further action against the ships during nighttime hours 
the pentagon said the iraqi vessels which were heading out of 
the persian gulf area were believed carrying iraqi oil 
baghdad said the tankers were not hit and continued on their 
way but that a similar act in the future will have grave 
consequences 
iraqs foreign minister tariq aziz said he did not consider 
the iraqi treatment of foreigners an act of war merely an attempt 
to prevent us forces massing in saudi arabia from attacking iraq 
or kuwait 
foreigners would live with the iraqis in some places that are 
the target of probable american aggression aziz told cbs news 
that might deter the american government from committing the 
crime that the iraqi people would like to avoid 
in an interview saturday with britains independent television 
news iraqi ambassador to france abdul razzak alhachimi said in 
paris some of them the foreigners have been distributed in 
strategic installations in iraq starting all the way from north of 
iraq to the south 
thomas r pickering the us ambassador to the united nations 
said later saturday that iraqs actions over the past 24 hours make 
it clear that iraqi president saddam hussein is going to hold 
hostage all foreigners 
us officials had previously avoided using the word hostage 
to refer to the americans and other foreigners trapped in iraq and 
kuwait 
the british foreign office said 40 britons five americans four 
germans and one french citizen were moved from kuwaiti hotels to 
undisclosed locations aziz told cbs that iraq will not use 
chemicals weapons unless the united states uses nuclear weapons in 
the conflict 
however iraqs army newspaper on saturday reiterated a threat 
to use weapons of mass destruction against any attacker an 
apparent reference to iraqs arsenal of longrange missiles nerve 
gas and mustard gas 
the united states meanwhile continued to pour thousands of 
troops into saudi arabia in an effort to build up a force that 
could withstand an invasion by tens of thousands of iraqi soldiers 
massed on the saudikuwait border 
for the first time since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 and later 
annexed the emirate us troops stationed in the saudi desert 
conducted maneuvers at night in temperatures that still hovered 
around 95 degrees 
were here sweating because our lives may depend on it said 
one private who carried a 50pound pack friday night but its 
really not up to us our lives are in the politicians hands 
finding the courage is tough said a medic traveling with 
the soldiers its scary out here but youve got to swallow that 
and go out and do it 
in other developments 
president bush prepared to call up military reserves to fill in 
the ranks of military doctors cargo handlers and other 
specialists an army source said as many as 80000 reservists and 
national guardsmen could be activated 
the pentagon launched an unprecedented diversion of civilian 
aircraft to bolster the us military presence in the middle east 
defense secretary dick cheney said the us military commitment 
to saudi arabias defense is longterm where well be a year 
or two from now i wouldnt want to speculate he said while en 
route to saudi arabia 
iraq which made peace overtures to iran in order to devote its 
full attention to the standoff with the united states withdrew 
thousands of troops from its iranian border and said they would be 
deployed near saudi arabia 
saudi arabia said it is ready to increase its oil output by up 
to 2 million barrels a day to help offset the shortfall caused by 
the iraqi invasion but a saudi minister said that would leave 
world markets 2 million barrels short of preinvasion levels and 
it may not halt soaring gas and oil prices 
thousands of arabs continued to reach jordan after fleeing from 
iraq and iraqoccupied kuwait the only westerners to get out were 
the few brave enough to dash for the border in private cars 
the baghdad government holds 3000 americans 4000 britons and 
about 14000 other westerners among the more than 2 million 
foreigners caught in iraq and kuwait when iraqi troops invaded 
kuwait on aug 2

about 120 troops stationed in saudi arabia are 
sitting in the front seat of armageddon without weapons or 
equipment for chemical warfare an noncommissioned officer said 
saturday 
i want to have a fighting chance i dont have that said 
air force master sgt johnnie bratton in a phone interview from 
dhahran on saturday night im ready to go out and do whatever i 
have to do but i dont have the minimum protection that is 
required 
the thousands of american servicemen recently deployed to saudi 
arabia are equipped for chemical warfare but those who have been 
there for months are not he said 
bratton a vietnam veteran who has been in the military for 19 
years said the persian gulf situation could evolve into another 
long conflict and troops should be protected every way possible 
were in the front seat of armaggedon he said 
bratton of san marcos said he and 120 other troops have been 
based at dhahran about 165 miles south of kuwait for up to two 
years on training missions he said his unit was composed of air 
force army and navy personnel and that he was based in grand 
forks nd declining to disclose further details 
bratton said he decided to speak to the news media after pleas 
to his superiors congressional leaders and others failed 
the pentagon had no immediate comment saturday night 
i dont have any knowledge of that said pentagon spokesman

us navy ships closely watched 
two iraqi tankers late saturday after the oilcarrying vessels 
ignored us warning shots and headed out of the persian gulf area 
us military officials said 
a navy officer told reporters with defense secretary dick cheney 
aboard the uss eisenhower in the red sea that the guidedmissile 
frigate uss reid fired the first shots of the twodayold 
interdiction effort ordered by president bush 
the pentagon later confirmed two iraqi ships were warned with 
gunfire in separate incidents and that both continued under the 
watch of us vessels the pentagon statement said both tankers 
were believed carrying iraqi oil 
officials aboard the ships said us forces briefly went to 
battle stations over the incidents the us operation is intended 
to halt goods leaving and entering iraq in the persian gulf crisis 
both tankers are currently under way but are under close us 
navy surveillance according to a pentagon statement issued late 
saturday when it was already past midnight in the gulf 
a pentagon official in washington speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the navy warships were unlikely to use any force 
against the tankers during nighttime hours 
the uss reid fired six warning shots across the bow of an iraqi 
tanker that it intercepted in the gulf of oman the pentagon said 
initial reports indicate the iraqiflagged vessel khanaqin 
refused repeated requests to halt and the reid then fired the 
warning shots the pentagon said 
also the uss bradley fired three warning shots across the bow 
of another iraqi tanker after it refused us requests to halt the 
pentagon said the unidentified tanker was in the persian gulf 
heading toward the gulf of oman 
the only iraqi port from which oil could be shipped is at the 
northern tip of the persian gulf connected to the gulf of oman 
through the strait of hormuz the gulf opens up into the arabian 
sea where oilladen ships fan out to world ports the eisenhower is 
on the other side of saudi arabia in the red sea 
in baghdad iraq reported that the united states had fired on 
two iraqi oil tankers that refused to be searched and said a 
similar act in the future would have grave consequences 
in the red sea capt morris foote of the guided missile cruiser 
ticonderoga said one of our frigates out in the gulf of oman 
has fired a warning shot at an iraqi tanker in fact fired six of 
them 
the ticonderoga was operating with the carrier eisenhower in the 
red sea on the opposite side of the saudi arabian peninsula from 
the shooting incident 
foote later clarified that statement to say the shots were fired 
across the bow of the tanker 
foote said the persian gulf forces initially went to battle 
stations the eisenhower battle group however did not go on high 
alert status during the shooting incident and he said the iraqi 
tanker posed no apparent danger to us forces 
the reid incident occurred about 4 pm local time 9 am edt 
south of the narrow entrance to the persian gulf from the gulf of 
oman 
foote did not have details but other officers said they believed 
the iraqi ship had not stopped when ordered foote said warning 
shots were fired by the reids 76 millimeter gun after the 
frigates commander received permission to do so from rear adm 
william fogarty commander of the middle east task force in the 
persian gulf 
iraqi oil minister issam chalabi said in baghdad that us 
warships had fired on the iraqi oil tanker baba karkar in the 
persian gulf and the oil tanker khanaqin in the gulf of oman 
chalabi said the shots fell in front and behind the ships and 
they proceeded without stopping 
foote said there was apparently no threat from the iraqi tanker 
in the gulf of oman which like all other commercial vessels should 
not be armed 
i dont think that there was any other provocation i dont 
think there was anything in fact threatening from the iraqis or 
from any other source he said 
but as a general course when we start getting into the 
business of firing shots youre never sure of the reaction he 
said 
on thursday evening president bush authorized american warships 
to use force if necessary to stop commerce headed to and from iraq 
and kuwait which is occupied by an estimated 160000 iraqi troops 
defense department spokesman pete williams accompanying cheney 
aboard the eisenhower at the beginning of a fourday trip to the 
region refused to comment on the situation cheney was not 
available for comment 
while on board the destroyer uss scott cheney was told that the 
scott had just returned from its interdiction duty at the mouth of 
the gulf of aqaba and had turned back a cypriot bulk freighter 
headed for the port 
the captain of the scott said the cypriot freighter was headed 
for the port of aqaba and had departed from port sudan sudans 
main red sea port 
scott commander tom corcoran said he had a very polite 
conversation with the master of the cypriot ship and the 
freighter turned around after reporting that it was carrying a 
cargo of aluminum chromate and other chemicals 
we didnt want to take the chance we maneuvered at a safe but 
fairly close distance and spoke on the radio corcoran told pool 
reporters 
he said the ship turned around and headed for an unknown 
destination 
cheney was to remain on the eisenhower until sunday morning when 
he was to travel to northern saudi arabia and visit american troops 
deployed on land in the defense of the desert kingdoms vital oil 
fields 
he was to travel on to bahrain and several other persian gulf 
nations before visiting in jiddah on monday and stopping in cairo 
before arriving back in washington early wednesday

the un security council on saturday 
unanimously demanded that iraq let all foreigners leave and the 
us ambassador accused baghdad of holding them hostage 
concern about thousands of americans west europeans and 
japanese trapped in iraq and kuwait heightened after iraq said 
friday foreigners from aggressive nations would be used as 
defensive shields for iraqi military installations 
on saturday iraq said some foreigners were moved to strategic 
installations around the country 
it also said the foreigners including babies and the elderly 
would be among the first to suffer the privations of the 
unordered embargo on iraq 
in its resolution saturday the security council demands that 
iraq permit and facilitate the immediate departure from kuwait and 
iraq of the nationals of third countries and grant immediate and 
continuing access of consular officials to such nationals 
the resolution also demands that iraq take no action to 
jeopardize the safety security or health of such nationals 
all 15 members of the council voted for the resolution yemen 
the only arab nation on the council voted for the resolution but 
its ambassador mohamed a sallam said food should be allowed into 
iraq 
the un sanctions allow food and medicine shipments to iraq for 
humanitarian purposes 
meanwhile un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
dispatched two senior un officials to baghdad to urge iraqi 
officials to safeguard the foreigners and let them leave 
earlier saturday us ambassador thomas r pickering denounced 
the latest moves by iraqi president saddam hussein 
we are now responding to the three steps which saddam hussein 
has taken in the last 24 hours including beginning a process of 
sequestering foreign nationals the announcement that he was going 
to use them as military shields and finally the statement this 
morning in which it was clear he was going to hold hostage all 
foreigners 
us officials had previously avoided using the word hostage 
to describe the americans and other foreigners trapped since the 
aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait 
asked if he was aware of anyone being harmed or in danger in 
iraq or occupied kuwait pickering said the united states was 
concerned about people who might need routine medical treatment 
iraqi ambassador abdul amir alanbari speaking before the 
security council said the economic embargo of his country is 
unjust and called the us blockade of food and medicines 
to iraqis a terrorist act 
iraq will not prevent foreign nationals from obtaining 
foodstuffs and medicines it will share with foreign nationals what 
comes in alanbari said 
the representative of the ousted kuwaiti government mohammad 
saad al sallal told the council the resolution addresses a 
situation unprecedented in the whole history of the international 
community the taking thousands rather millions of citzens of 
many countries as ransom 
saturdays resolution was the fourth passed by the council 
condemning iraq since the invasion the council previously 
denounced the iraqi invasion imposed the trade embargo and 
rejected the annexation of kuwait 
in the resolution the council again declared the annexation of 
kuwait null and void and therefore demands that the government 
of iraq rescind its orders for the closure of diplomatic and 
consular missions in kuwait and the withdrawal of the immunity of 
their personnel 
iraq has ordered all embassies in kuwait to close claiming the 
country is now part of iraq and diplomats should only be accredited 
in baghdad 
un spokesman fred eckhard said perez de cuellar is sending two 
undersecretarygenerals to baghdad to discuss freedom of movement 
for the foreigners in iraq and kuwait 
the two un officials whom he did not name are expected to 
arrive in baghdad early monday 
the baghdad government holds 3000 americans 4000 britons and 
about 14000 other westerners among the more than 2 million 
foreigners caught in iraq and kuwait when iraq invaded kuwait 
thousands of arabs east europeans and soviets and asians have been 
allowed to cross into jordan 
a usled multinational force and an arab force have been 
deployed to keep iraq from attacking saudi arabia and to impose the 
trade embargo on iraq 
a statement read over iraqi television and radio saturday 
referred to the usled quarantine as an act of war and said 
that as food and medicine become scarce supplies will be set aside 
for the military 
were outraged ambassador sir crispin tickell of britain 
said earlier saturday its almost incredible something like that 
could happen

also were convicted of riot 
the three were jailed without bail as juveniles they faced a 
maximum of 10 years in prison at sentencing sept 11 
the 30yearold jogger was found lying senseless in a pool of 
blood after the april 19 1989 attack in a coma for two weeks 
she recovered enough to return to her investment banking job and 
give dramatic testimony at the trial 
the jury spent 10 days in deliberations the last three 
convincing one holdout who believed mccray was innocent it also 
took three days to consider the attempted murder charges said 
juror charles nestorick the jury finally decided to acquit because 
they believed the teenagers didnt intend to kill 
youths that age are not well versed in how many blows it takes 
to kill someone nestorick said 
the case created enormous sympathy for the victim whose name 
was not printed by most newspapers the defendants also had 
supporters who demonstrated outside the courthouse regularly 
charging racism because the victim was white and wealthy the 
youths black or hispanic 
defense attorneys claimed police lied and threatened santana and 
mccray into making videotaped confessions salaam did not sign a 
written statement or make a videotaped statement 
prosecutors said the three defendants were part of a gang of as 
many as 30 youths who rampaged through the park harassing at least 
nine people three other teenagers charged in the assault on the 
woman await trial two are free on bond 
salaam mccray and santana also were convicted of assault and 
robbery for attacks on two male joggers john loughlin and david 
lewis 
the woman was jogging through the northern end of the park when 
she was attacked she was dragged about 70 feet into the woods 
gangraped and bashed repeatedly with a brick and pipe 
she recovered enough to resume work and jogging within eight 
months of the attack she is a vice president for salomon brothers 
a wall street firm 
in a statement after the verdict mayor david dinkins said the 
attack seared the soul of every decent new yorker 
we should recommit ourselves to building a city and forging a 
society in which such heinous crimes do not occur he said 
while the womans recovery was inspirational to many new 
yorkers a few activists including the rev al sharpton claimed 
police arrested the youths because most were black 
earlier saturday the jurors had asked for the fourth time to 
see mccrays videotaped statement in which he told police he 
kicked the jogger and feigned sex with her to impress his friends 
mccrays father bobby mccray testified he encouraged his son 
to lie to police because he was led to believe there was an 
agreement that would allow his son to go free the detective who 
took the statement said no deal was offered 
another detective testified that santana told him he counted 33 
youths who entered the park shortly after 9 pm on the night of 
the attack to beat up and rip off joggers and cyclists 
when the group saw the female jogger on her nightly sixmile 
run we all charged her mccray said on the videotape she 
struggled and screamed as several teenagers dragged her from the 
paved drive down a wooded slope into the darkness he said 
the defendants told detectives the naked woman was struck with a 
metal pipe bashed in the head and face with a brick cut on the 
legs with a knife and sexually attacked in a frenzy of violence 
assistant district attorney elizabeth lederer said 
the trials most riveting moment came when the jogger took the 
witness stand she walked unsteadily before describing the lasting 
effects of the attack trouble with balance and sight no sense of 
smell a sixweek stretch of amnesia 
the rampaging youths went on to attack several other people 
loughlin a teacher hospitalized for two days with his injuries 
lewis a banker who escaped serious injury because of his speed 
and john goode a british airways employee who was punched 
medical workers testified the woman had lost about 
threequarters of her blood and was near death when she arrived at 
a hospital she later was transferred to a connecticut 
rehabilitation center 
the jurors criticized salaams attorney robert burns for 
putting his client on the stand 
it shot down everything he had going for him because his story 
was so farfetched nestorick said

the pentagon geared up for expected activation 
of thousands of reserves as us warships began attempting to 
enforce an embargo against iraq on saturday firing warning shots 
at two iraqi oil tankers and shadowing them as they sailed away 
under cover of darkness 
president bush could activate as many as 80000 members of the 
army reserve and the army national guard to bolster the us 
military buildup in the middle east which defense secretary dick 
cheney said could last for years 
but the actual number was likely to be much less said an army 
source speaking on the condition of anonymity the source said 
80000 was a tentative upper limit planning figure 
the shots were the first fired by american forces in the persian 
gulf crisis following bushs order thursday to interdict shipments 
in and out of iraq using the minimum force necessary 
iraqi oil minister issam chalabi said the shots fell in front of 
and behind the two tankers the baba karkar in the persian gulf and 
the khanaqin in the gulf of oman and they proceeded without 
stopping 
the pentagon said navy ships were closely monitoring the two 
iraqi tankers heading out of the persian gulf area and believed to 
be carrying iraqi oil military sources said it was unlikely the 
navy would take any further action against the ships during the 
night which settled over the region a few hours after the initial 
incidents 
but the iraqi news agency said a third iraqi tanker was fired 
upon sunday as it sailed in the central part of the gulf it did 
not say in which direction the ship was heading or name the us 
warship that allegedly fired the shots sunday 
the report could not be immediately confirmed independently and 
a pentagon spokesman marine lt col stuart wagner said 
nothing has been called into the pentagon about it we have not 
been notified of any such incident 
in a statement the pentagon said the uss reid fired six warning 
shots across the bow of an khanaqin in the gulf of oman after it 
refused repeated requests to halt 
also the uss bradley fired three warning shots across the bow 
of another iraqi tanker in the persian gulf and headed toward the 
gulf of oman the pentagon said 
both tankers are currently under way but are under close us 
navy surveillance the pentagon said 
iraqs only port is nestled at the northernmost tip of the 
persian gulf which connects with the gulf of oman through the 
strait of hormuz beyond the gulf of oman is the arabian sea and 
beyond that the open waters of the indian ocean 
meanwhile fears mounted that iraqi president saddam hussein was 
using us citizens and other foreign nationals in iraq and 
occupied kuwait as weapons in his battle to defeat unsponsored 
economic sanctions 
the iraqi government announced that the sanctions were causing 
shortages of food including milk for babies it said the same 
calamity would befall the thousands of foreign nationals 
including babies under iraqi control because the government 
considered the sanctions an act of war 
the white house said it was deeply concerned by iraqs latest 
moves 
the use of innocent civilians as pawns to promote what iraq 
sees to be its selfinterest is contrary to international law and 
indeed to all accepted norms of international conduct 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said from kennebunkport 
maine 
an estimated 3000 americans are in iraq and kuwait 
bush vacationing in kennebunkport was preparing to sign an 
executive order to authorize the callup of thousands of army navy 
and air force reserves officials said he had decided a callup was 
necessary but details of how many and from which reserve units 
were still being worked out 
a wide variety of tasks are assigned to reserve forces from 
cargo handling and medical support to aerial refueling and infantry 
operations the army navy and air force are heavily dependent on 
the reserves during a largescale mobilization 
a reserve callup shows the magnitude of the us military 
commitment in saudi arabia which cheney described as long term 
and said might last for years 
where well be a year or two from now i wouldnt want to 
speculate cheney told reporters friday en route to the desert 
kingdom cheney was on a fourday swing through several gulf 
nations to visit us soldiers sailors and airmen and to talk with 
government officials 
a decision to activate reserves is fraught with domestic 
political risk because of a public perception that it is tantamount 
to putting the nation on a war footing 
cheney had recommended to bush that he use his authority to call 
as many as 200000 armed services reserves to active duty it would 
be the first reserve callup for military action since president 
johnson activated 35000 reserves in 1968 following the tet 
offensive in vietnam and the seizure by north korea of the us 
surveillance ship pueblo 
some reservists would be deployed to us military installations 
and ports to help with the transportation of troops and equipment 
to saudi arabia others may make the trip to the arabian desert as 
part of the us combat force 
reserves provide more than twothirds of wartime medical 
personnel support threequarters of medical evacuation crews and 
nearly all of the navys search and rescue operations 
in a further indication of the enormous scale of the us 
military deployment the pentagon on friday night announced it was 
commandeering up to 38 airplanes from 29 commercial carriers to 
help ferry troops and cargo to the middle east it was the first 
time the pentagon has exercised its contractual right to use the 
civil reserve air fleet in the 38 year that the program has existed 
and on saturday the navy issued a formal statement confirming 
earlier acknowledgment from pentagon sources that the aircraft 
carrier uss kennedy was being dispatched to the middle east 
also the head of the military sealift command said the navy 
which runs the seatransport system chartered four commercial 
merchant ships to bolster its fleet of vessels ferrying supplies 
weapons and equipment to saudi arabia 
admiral francis donovan said in an interview that more 
commercial ships would be needed in the days ahead he said the 
overall sealift was operating satisfactorily 
he declined to provide exact details of the sealift but said 
nine ships prepositioned near guam and the indian ocean island of 
diego garcia were carrying enough supplies to saudi arabia to 
sustain 33000 marines for 30 days

guidedmissile frigate uss reid fired the first shots saturday of a 
twodayold interdiction effort ordered by president george bush 
in washington the us defense department later confirmed that 
two iraqi ships had been warned with gunfire in separate incidents 
and that both continued sailing under the watch of the naval 
vessels 
on saturday the uss reid fired six warning shots across the bow 
of an iraqi tanker that it intercepted in the gulf of oman the 
pentagon said 
later the uss bradley fired three warning shots across the bow

unimposed economic sanctions against iraq designed to force that 
country to withdraw from kuwait which it invaded on aug 2 and 
later annexed

president saddam hussein of iraq said on sunday that he will 
hold westerners who have been detained since the kuwaiti invasion 
at vital targets in iraq to avert a catastrophe that might 
result from a usled attack 
but he offered to let the foreigners leave if president bush 
offers written guarantees that american forces will be withdrawn 
from saudi arabia and that the embargo imposed on iraq after it 
invaded kuwait will be lifted 
earlier iraqi government statements had said the foreigners 
would be used as a shield for iraqi military installations and 
that they would suffer first if an international embargo on iraq 
causes shortages of food and medicine 
sundays statement broadcast on iraqi television and translated 
by the associated press was described as an open letter to the 
families of the thousands of foreigners including 3000 americans 
trapped in iraq and kuwait 
saddam also defended detaining the foreigners blamed western 
powers for causing the persian gulf crisis and reiterated iraqs 
longstanding historical claims to kuwait which it annexed six days 
after its invasion three weeks ago 
us warships on saturday fired warning shots at two iraqi oil 
tankers one in the persian gulf and one further south in the gulf 
of oman 
the official iraqi news agency claimed that us warships fired 
on another iraqi tanker sunday as it sailed in the central persian 
gulf but the pentagon and shipping sources in the region could not 
confirm the report 
elsewhere in the gulf an official in the jordanian port of 
aqaba said us warships prevented a sudanese ferry from entering 
the port sunday to pick up 550 sudanese who had escaped from iraq 
and iraqioccupied kuwait 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said us 
warships also searched a chinese freighter sunday before allowing 
it to enter the port 
although jordan has said it will enforce an international 
embargo on iraqi goods heavy trucks with iraqi license plates 
continue to load goods from docked ships and warehouses in the port 
area and drive them back to iraq the embargo was imposed after 
iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
since overrunning kuwait iraq has mined kuwaits oil ports and 
placed explosives in kuwait citys electric and water plants 
according to a report from official radio france international that 
quoted egyptian engineers 
refugees fleeing occupied kuwait said on sunday that a kuwaiti 
resistance fighter carried out a suicide car bomb attack friday on 
iraqi forces near a hospital in a suburb of kuwait city a 
clandestine kuwait radio station said an unspecified number of 
iraqi soldiers died or were wounded in the attack 
defense secretary dick cheney said sunday that iraq has massed 
200000 troops and more than 1000 tanks on the saudi border and 
that us forces in the region are there to defend the oilrich 
nation from a possible iraqi attack cheney spoke to servicemen 
aboard the uss eisenhower in the red sea 
at another stop at a military base in saudi arabia cheney 
refused to say how many us troops have been rushed to the 
kingdom but he said they should be able to repulse an attack 
ordered by saddam 
should saddam hussein be foolish enough to launch an attack on 
saudi arabia we would be able to do a very effective job of making 
him pay a bit of a price for that cheney said but he added 
obviously ill be more comfortable once weve got more forces in 
the country 
also sunday the gulf cooperation council alliance was to meet 
in jiddah saudi arabia sources said to consider sending troops 
to help defend member nations who include saudi arabia bahrain 
and the united arab emirates 
the latest iraqi statements carried by the iraqi news agency 
came amid growing international anxiety over the fate of an 
estimated 21000 westerners including 3000 americans who were 
trapped in iraq and kuwait by the invasion 
the statements also came just hours after the un security 
council unanimously demanded that iraq let all foreigners leave and 
take no action to jeopardize the safety security or health of 
such nationals 
in one statement carried by the news agency iraq singled out 
western foreigners and australians living in three cities in 
kuwait for assembly at three hotels in the capital kuwait city 
it said the measure was to secure their safety and anyone who 
does not comply will together with his government bear full 
responsibility for any undesirable action that might be targeted 
against them by hostile elements 
westerners in kuwait city alnidaa and aljahrah were ordered 
to assemble at the hyatt regency the meridian and the 
international according to the statement monitored in nicosia 
cyprus 
aljahrah is the site of a former kuwaiti military air base west 
of kuwait city but the location of alnidaa could not immediately 
be determined 
radio france international also reported sunday that iraq has 
moved some westerners to kuwaiti oil installations to prevent them 
from being attacked 
the iraqi statement was the second such asssembly order in four 
days on thursday american and british nationals in kuwait were 
ordered to report to hotels but no iraqi officials were there to 
meet the few who showed up 
on saturday iraq said foreigners would be the first to suffer 
if the embargo results in shortages of food and medicine in iraq 
on friday iraq said foreigners may be placed around iraqi military 
installaions to prevent us forces in the region from attacking 
them 
on sunday the iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz called us 
shipping interdiction efforts piracy and armed aggression and 
demanded the international community condemn them the iraqi news 
agency said 
in a letter to un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar on 
sunday aziz protested the warning shots fired at iraqi tankers 
the news agency said 
such acts are clear proofs that america is permitting itself 
to commit piracy and armed aggression on high seas against iraq 
the letter said 
two us destroyers meanwhile steamed through the suez canal 
on sunday on their way to the red sea a canal official said 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the john

israel officials said sunday that jordan has 
declared a toplevel military alert and is recruiting more than 
80000 volunteers for the iraqi army moves that have confused 
israel and heightened tension in the region 
a senior government official said the jordanian actions follow 
repeated signals from israel that it has no intention of attacking 
the neighboring country 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity told the 
associated press israeli intelligence analysts have concluded that 
a usiraqi military conflict is imminent 
he said analysts also believe that iraq is likely to use 
palestinian terror groups for attacks on us targets in the middle 
east 
speaking of jordan the official said the army has been placed 
on the highest possible level of alert and is ready for war what 
war we dont understand 
the official declined to specify what steps have been taken by 
jordans military but a reporter who arrived from jordan last week 
said police and army leaves were cancelled and civil defense was 
being organized in the jordan valley along the 225mile border 
with israel 
in jordans capital of amman rumors of impending mobilization 
of reserves circulated among the population the reporter added 
the israeli official said israel was unable to comprehend the 
jordanian moves and was worried that jordans king hussein may be 
losing control 
after knowing this guy for 37 years we suddenly come to a 
point when we dont understand what he does he said but maybe 
it does not matter what the king says or does anymore because he 
may not be in control 
hussein has remained iraqs closest ally throughout the persian 
gulf crisis israel is concerned that iraq may eventually use 
jordan as a platform from which to attack the jewish state and has 
warned that the entrance of iraqi troops into the kingdom would 
mean war 
the official expressed concern that king hussein known as a 
moderate may now be swept up in the wave of proiraqi enthusiasm 
in jordan 
he cited mass rallies in support of iraqs president saddam 
hussein persistent proiraqi propaganda by the jordanian media 
and the registration of some 80000 jordanians who have volunteered 
to serve in the army of iraq 
the official said king hussein is definitely in alliance with 
saddam he is agitating proiraqi sentiments and definitely did not 
agree to fully blockade aqaba jordans red sea port and a 
principle supply route for iraq 
as one sign of increasing tension the official noted sundays 
firefight between an israeli military patrol and two jordanian 
soldiers who infiltrated into israel one jordanian was shot to 
death and another wounded and captured 
we expect more such clashes the official said 
some israeli military analysts said jordans military actions 
could be explained by fear of an israeli preemptive strike 
the jordanian action is a prudent one they are worried about 
a possible israeli preemptive strike i would do the same thing in 
their place said ron benishai military commentator for the 
daily yediot ahronot 
but the government official said israel had repeatedly assured 
king hussein that it had no aggressive intentions we have sent 
all kinds of signals to calm him the official said 
as part of its effort to reassure jordan the government has 
requested officials to avoid alarming statements such as claims by 
rightwing politicians that a palestinian state should be created 
in jordan the government official said 
we are definitely not saying anything that we know can provoke 
more worry on the part of king hussein he said 
turning to the gulf the official said israeli intelligence has 
concluded that the americans are preparing for a military strike 
and we believe saddam will resist he said it was still unclear 
who will start a shooting war 
but saddam was prepared to use palestinian terrorist groups for 
attacks on american targets including those in saudi arabia 
the official said 
he said the organizations likely to be used include the radical 
abu nidal group abul abbas palestine liberation front and perhaps 
other factions of the palestine liberation organization

cafe specialty grocers costa e martins and the 350yearold casa 
batalha button shop on rua garrett 
the disaster inspired a debate worthy of the ferrari on topics 
ranging from city planning to safety standards 
most of the woodframe buildings had no fire sprinklers stone 
terraces in a new pedestrian mall kept fire trucks away from the 
heart of the blaze 
many lisbon residents proud of the beauty of a city stretching 
over seven hills along the shimmering tagus estuary worried that 
modern office blocks might be built in the old baixa or lower town 
in 1985 controversial architect tomas taveira shocked the city 
by building the amoreiras a massive pastelcolored shopping 
apartment and office complex atop one of the citys hills the 
amoreiras is a commercial success but few lisbon inhabitants say 
they like its style 
faced with this traditionalmodern rivalry siza departed from 
the contemporary ascetic style that won him the alvar aalto 
international architecture award in 1988 
it would have been wrong to use an accident to make an island 
of modern architecture in the historic center of lisbon he said 
chiado will look much the same as before he said because 18 of 
the 20 charred facades now propped by scaffolding can be saved but 
there will be new hidden improvements and the district wont 
be a museum 
the project approved by mayor jorge sampaio last month 
includes a luxury hotel and smallscale shopping malls behind the 
facades 
up to 40 percent of space on upper floors of reconstructed 
buildings will be devoted to apartments to keep people in the 
chiado not offices the architect said 
a new subway station will link the district with the baixa 
which was rebuilt on a grid system by the marquis of pombal after 
an earthquake destroyed most of lisbon in 1755 
one victim of the quake was the carmo convent siza plans a 
pedestrian ramp leading up to the convent ruins which have become 
part of lisbons skyline and to the labyrinth of trendy bars and 
restaurants in the narrow cobbled streets of the bairro alto or 
upper town 
the stone terraces on the rua do carmo that stopped the fire 
trucks will be ripped up and the street reopened to limited traffic 
mayor sampaio said the chiado project would set a precedent for 
restoring other parts of the city some of which date to the 11th 
century 
two areas that need renovation are alfama and mouraria where 
the rosepink and ocher houses usually are in bad repair because 
regulated low rents do not leave the owners enough money to fix 
them 
city housing expert vasco franco said 15 neglected houses 
collapsed in last winters heavy rains and he hoped foreign 
financing could be obtained perhaps from the european community 
repairing the old houses is cheaper than building new ones he 
said 
last year the ec gave 135000 toward the renovation of 
mouraria the old arab quarter symbolic but a good start 
said joao geraldes another city project coordinator

she arrived in central park just another 
anonymous new york runner she came out of a coma 15 days later as 
a tabloid headline a victim of unspeakable crime and a symbol of 
hope in a city choked by violence 
shes known to millions now but still maintains her anonymity 
to all but a handful she is as nameless and faceless as she was on 
april 19 1989 her remarkable recovery inspired the city just as 
the brutality of her assault had horrified it 
the central park jogger 
she was found lying in a puddle of mud and blood early on april 
20 unconscious she arrived at metropolitan hospital a short time 
later an unlikely candidate for survival much less recovery she 
seemed destined to become another fatality in a record year for 
homicides 
her skull had been fractured threequarters of her blood was 
gone splattered around the roadway crossing the park her body 
temperature had dipped into the 80s 
she needed a machine to breathe her body was bruised literally 
from head to toe with severe head lacerations brain contusions 
and fractured facial bones 
photos of her injuries produced looks of dismay and disbelief 
from a jury which sat pokerfaced through six weeks of graphic 
testimony about her injuries 
on a scale of 3 to 15 used by neurologists to measure brain 
function the woman was rated a 4 even as she began to emerge from 
the coma attending physician dr howard s kurtz put her chances 
for full recovery at slim 
slowly steadily she came back new yorkers were cheered by 
reports of her highfiving a nurse of a soft hello to her 
brother 
she had no recollection of the events that changed her life her 
last memory before the attack was canceling dinner with a friend 
her next was waking up in the hospital for the memorial day weekend 
her progress could be charted by the holidays rapid improvement 
in a connecticut rehabilitation center by labor day back home 
and out jogging again for thanksgiving back at work by 
christmas and ringing in the new year with a promotion to vice 
president at salomon brothers 
while it appeared on the surface that her life was returning to 
normal the jogger in a dramatic 12minute appearance in a 
manhattan courtroom demonstrated that things were forever altered 
in her life 
it was 15 months after the attack when a bailiff in state 
supreme court summoned the woman now 30 to the witness stand by 
now everyone knew who she was there was silence for 2 minutes as 
spectators and reporters waited tension building for the arrival 
of the central park jogger 
she took her seat slowly assisted by a court officer a jagged 
scar ran along her face mute testimony to the viciousness of her 
attackers in a steady voice she detailed the lasting effects of 
the beating she cant remember 
i have problems with balance when im walking and 
coordination at times ill veer off to the right or the left 
she testified i have trouble walking down steps i also lost my 
sense of smell completely that has not come back 
i have double vision when im reading i hold newspapers over 
to the left to compensate it takes a fair amount of concentration 
to make the image one 
she left the courtroom and slipped quietly back into her 
daytoday existence her anonymity respected by almost all news 
media 
yet everyone reported intimate details of the womans life after 
her testimony her method of birth control the last time she made 
love with her boyfriend a defense lawyer in his closing argument 
suggested she stopped for a tryst on her way to the park and had 
never been raped 
much of her background is well known a pennsylvania native 
holder of graduate degrees from yale a wall street investment 
banker a hard worker a dedicated runner family members say she 
holds no grudges and remains determined in her recovery 
but no one can say what the future holds for the central park 
jogger other than to say it cant be like the past 
the fact that she could even come to this courtroom is a 
miracle assistant district attorney elizabeth lederer told the 
jury in her closing argument the jogger will never be the same 
as she was

as military tensions in the persian gulf 
increase the sixyear american effort to moderate iraqi policies 
seems in retrospect like perhaps the most ineffectual us 
diplomatic venture in more than a decade 
the reagan administrations attempts to tame president saddam 
hussein evoke memories of the 1970s when the united states tried 
to encourage peaceful behavior in the soviet union by promoting 
expanded trade and financial ties 
over the short term the detente policy toward the soviets 
was a disappointment by contrast it was a glittering success next 
to the outcome of the us effort in iraq 
an overture to iraq seemed to some an obvious option for the 
reagan administration in the early 1980s at the time the big 
concern was iran and its goal of spreading its shiite 
fundamentalist orthodoxy elsewhere in the gulf region and beyond 
by the fall of 1984 the united states had removed iraq from the 
list of countries engaged in statesponsored terrorism and had 
restored full diplomatic relations with baghdad 
american rice and wheat farmers began doing a flourishing 
business with baghdad and iraq also made use of the us 
exportimport bank to buy american products on credit overall 
transactions between the two countries were measured in the 
billions of dollars 
the new york times reported last week that the cia provided the 
iraqis with valuable military information on their iranian foes the 
long and bloody iraniraq war of the 1980s the united states also 
helped finance iraqs war effort through oil purchases 
part of the reason for helping the iraqis was concern that they 
might otherwise be routed by iran since the end of the war in 
1988 the rationale for maintaining ties with iraq changed it was 
thought that saddam would be eager to preserve the benefits of his 
economic ties with the united states and shape his foreign policy 
accordingly 
thus the administration resisted congressional attempts this 
year to impose economic sanctions against iraq arguing that the 
dissolution of the relationship would rob the united states of all 
leverage with saddam 
so appalling was iraqs behavior even before the kuwaiti 
invasion that at least one farm state senator kansas republican 
nancy kassebaum lobbied hard for economic sanctions even though 
many of her own constituents have benefitted from iraqi wheat 
purchases 
the iraqi conquest of kuwait on aug 2 dramatized just how much 
the administration overestimated its sway with the iraqis 
to many members of congress the warning signs have been there 
to see for years iraq has a record of using chemical weapons 
dating back to 1984 and used them against iraqi kurds just two 
years ago 
since iraqs war with iran ended there has been no appreciable 
reduction in iraqi military spending iraq has a millionman 
military and missiles capable of reaching israel it is believed to 
be the worlds largest manufacturer of chemical weapons it may 
also be developing biological weapons and it is harboring some of 
the most radical palestinian leaders 
secretary of state james a baker iii spoke for many current and 
past government officials last week when alluding to iraqs 
behavior dating back to the 1980s he said the united states 
should have been concerned about all of this years ago other 
officials conceded that the united states should have been far more 
outspoken in calling attention to iraqi behavior 
perhaps kuwait should have been more wary as well the kuwaitis 
lent the iraqis more than 10 billion to help the finance saddams 
war effort against iran 
now saddam has contrived a way not to have to pay the kuwaitis 
back

armed serbs patrolled streets in the 
republic of croatia sunday to stop police from intervening as the 
serb minority voted on autonomy in open defiance of a government 
ban 
voters formed long lines in front of polling booths in this 
serbian center in southwestern croatia for the referendum 
organized by the serbian democratic party the party favors a 
degree of selfgovernment for serbs 
croatians who are roman catholic dominate the western half of 
yugoslavia while orthodox serbs form the majority in the south of 
the country the two ethnic groups have been traditional rivals 
ever since they were united within yugoslavia in 1918 
according to official statistics serbs make up 11 percent of 
croatias 5 million people the two ethnic groups are intermingled 
in a patchwork of small communities in southwestern croatia 
if the referendum is passed it is likely to worsen tensions 
between the two groups voting was to continue for the next two 
weeks in ethnic serbian areas of croatia 
the vote was declared illegal by croatias government which 
says it is part of a scenario to destabilize the newly elected 
administration 
organizers of the referendum said that all ethnic serbs born in 
the area were being allowed to vote and that the referendum is 
expected to be passed by a near unanimous vote 
nikola ozegovic the official in charge of one polling station 
claimed that about 90 percent of the eligible voters among knins 
10000 serbs had cast ballots by early afternoon the town has a 
total population of about 11000 
he said that croatians who expressed a desire to vote for 
autonomy were being allowed to participate in the ballot he said 
two such croatian women were permitted to vote at his polling 
station 
serbs armed with automatic rifles patrolled streets and stood 
guard at government buildings and the radio station to prevent 
police from intervening in the vote 
on friday and saturday armed villagers blocked highways leading 
to the adriatic coast on sunday traffic was reported to be 
flowing through the roadbocks which were manned by serbs with 
walkietalkies 
we cant believe the serbs are suddenly so full of hatred for 
us said nikola pozar a local croatian political leader but 
weve been advised by the croatian government not to respond to 
their provocations he added 
authorities in croatia where a centerright party swept into 
power last spring in the first multiparty elections in the area in 
more than 50 years claimed the plebiscite was being directed by 
the communist leadership of serbia yugoslavias largest state 
they said the effort was an attempt to divert public attention from 
the lack of democratic reforms in serbia 
polling stations were decorated with posters showing the red 
blue and white serbian flag and a large yes printed in the 
middle there were no voting booths and ballots were marked openly 
in front of polling officials 
yugoslavia is a loose federation of six republics and two 
autonomous provinces

commerce secretary robert a mosbacher expects 
growing exports to keep the us economy out of a recession this 
year 
reacting ecstatically to the record export posting in the latest 
merchandise trade report mosbacher said in an interview in his 
fifth floor office late last week 
i feel that the export side not only will keep us out of 
recession but its going to bring back a continuing higher growth 
the record 343 billion in exports combined with a reduced 
3937 billion in imports resulted in a 507 billion trade 
deficit in june the lowest since a 396 billion imbalance in june 
1983 
asked if he were satisfied with the report mosbacher replied 
satisfied might be an understatement im very pleased with it 
he said emphasizing the word very 
so far this year he said of the export gain its very much 
across the board its capital goods its hightech goods and 
its agriculture 
the secretary repeated his belief that the nations merchandise 
trade deficit would drop below 100 billion this year for the first 
time since 1983 already he said the deficit has tumbled to 458 
billion the lowest sixmonth imbalance since the second half of 
1983 
but like most other observers he had a caveat the rising cost 
of oil following the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
now you tell me how long the crisis will last and the prices 
will stay up if the price of oil doesnt stay up very long well 
still make it he said 
many analysts have said they believe skyrocketing oil prices 
will cause americas oil bill to shoot up in the second half of the 
year offsetting any growth in exports 
mosbacher said the united states has been running an oil deficit 
of between 47 billion and 48 billion a year thats 18 a 
barrel oil plus or minus if youve got 27 oil you got about a 
50 percent increase 
on friday oil was costing nearly twice the 1464 a barrel it 
averaged during june 
nevertheless assuming oil prices do decline soon he said 
were headed at close to a 90 billion trade deficit this year 
it could be 95 billion under 100 billion is what ive been 
saying 
that would be more than a onethird cut from the 1987 peak 
deficit of 15212 billion the trade imbalance has declined each 
year since then falling to 109 billion last year 
the commerce secretary attributed the export progress to the 
decline in the dollar improved quality of us goods and greater 
export expertise 
us goods are a lot cheaper overseas now for these 
customers he said plus our quality keeps improving and our 
knowledge of how to export keeps improving and finally the 
governments working with exporters 
this is just what we need to accomplish to keep our 
competitive edge in this world export buildup he said you 
know instead of talking about what we can do to limit imports we 
need to keep working on building exports 
thus far he said the growing export base shows american 
business is competitive around the world it shows american 
business is beginning to realize its a global marketplace with 
the biggest potential area of growth and unsatisfied demand is 
outside the us 
and it does create jobs and business opportunities for 
everyone he said it can keep the economy on the positive 
side i mean keep us from a recession

a grimfaced president bush headed 
back to washington to review the persian gulf crisis with national 
security advisers sunday as the administration for the first time 
called foreigners trapped in iraq and kuwait hostages 
bush scheduled a dinner meeting with senior officials and 
planned to remain at the white house overnight on monday he will 
deliver a major speech in baltimore before the annual veterans of 
foreign wars convention focusing on the showdown with iraq and the 
high stakes it holds for the united states 
the president is to return to his vacation home later monday 
after stopping at a republican fundraising reception at a rhode 
island country club 
bushs mood has noticeably darkened over the past week as 
baghdad has issued increasingly bellicose statements and has warned 
that it will use foreigners as a shield against western attack 
there are an estimated 3000 americans in iraq and iraqioccupied 
kuwait 
thomas r pickering the us ambassador to the united nations 
said saturday that iraqi president saddam hussein had made clear 
that he was going to hold hostage all foreigners us 
officials previously had avoided using the word hostage to 
describe the foreigners trapped since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
bush emerging from services at st anns episcopal church with 
his family ignored a reporters shouted question about whether he 
agreed with pickerings characterization he walked directly to his 
limousine instead of stopping to greet fellow worshippers as he 
usually does 
a day earlier a visibly irritated bush announced that he was 
going to stop answering questions from reporters on the golf course 
during sundays service the rector the rev laman h bruner 
jr offered a poignant prayer for the president the captive 
foreigners in iraq and kuwait and the success of the us military 
mission 
o almighty god uphold the hand of our president in our 
resolve in the middle east support with thy might our people in 
their proving that they fear not the threatenings and strokes of 
their enemy bruner said 
protect those who are interned and restore them to their homes 
in safety he added

western reporters are finding that 
the challenge of reporting in a society that has been virtually 
closed to foreigners until now is as stiff as working in heat that 
often soars above 100 degrees 
although the saudi government allowed the defense department to 
chaperone a small pool of reporters in the country more than a week 
ago it was not until the last few days that the kingdom agreed to 
grant visas for open coverage to more than a dozen journalists 
when the thumbsup came on visas the networks were ready 
we are hitting the ground running nbctvs today show 
cohost bryant gumbel said as he plotted the days work sunday with 
two producers in the coffee shop of the dhahran international hotel 
gumbel and at least a score of other foreign television and news 
reporters have arrived in saudi arabia more than two weeks after 
iraqi troops invaded kuwait 
the thousands of american troops president bush dispatched to 
defend this desert kingdom have turned saudi arabia into the 
hottest news story around literally 
habib shaheen a spokesman for the saudi government said the 
number of reporters in the country was unprecedented the last time 
he dealt with all four television networks here was three years ago 
when iranians attacked mecca he said 
on saturday the saudi government flew reporters including 
some of the biggest names in television to jiddah 1000 miles 
away for interviews with top officials 
ever sensitive to the draw of television the government 
arranged for nbcs tom brokaw abcs sam donaldson and cbs bob 
simon to have individual interviews with the saudi oil minister and 
the foreign minister 
very smooth donaldson pronounced after his 10 minutes with 
prince saud alfaisal the foreign minister alfaisal clad in his 
traditional flowing robe and red headdress spoke in flawless 
english as he recounted saudi arabias insistence that iraqi troops 
leave kuwait 
the saudis decision to open their borders awed some reporters 
who until now have spent years trying to penetrate the kingdom 
we would wait forever just to get one interview and now we 
have three top officials in one day said barnie mason of bbc 
radio 
although the saudis appear to be amenable to open coverage 
gumbel said he thought it might be difficult to really find out 
what is happening in the country where some citizens are not keen 
on opening their society 
we have a different culture please be kind to us said 
ahmad alotiri an f15 pilot 
he said he hated television reports that seemed to be critical 
of saudi arabia such as one that focused on saudi displeasure at 
american soldiers wearing teeshirts 
and a highranking saudi official said the reluctance for 
publicity has not been forgotten 
whatever the news the logistics for covering it are formidable 
cnns carl rochelle was the pool reporter who flew to saudi 
arabia with the defense department once in the country he and his 
technicians had to set up a portable satellite earth station at the 
dhahran air base 
the heat was so intense that one technician was overcome and 
military officials were forced to install an air conditioner in a 
tent 
weve learned to drink a lot of water said tom mote a cnn 
cameraman

jurors say they decided to acquit three 
teenagers of attempted murder in the central park jogger case 
because they did not think the youths intended to kill the young 
woman who suffered brain damage 
juror rafael miranda said the mood in the jury room was often 
tense with a lot of screaming and a lot of names called 
before the teenagers were convicted saturday night of raping and 
assaulting the jogger 
the anonymous victim now 30 became a national figure as she 
recovered from the savage assault by a youth gang during her 
nightly run on april 19 1989 
the savage attack on the woman taking her nightly run horrified 
new yorkers because of its randomness and brutality 
after therapy she returned to work and to jogging within eight 
months but she doesnt remember the attack has lost her sense of 
smell and sometimes has difficulty in walking and in focusing her 
vision 
like some other recent highprofile trials in new york city 
this case involved victims and attackers of different races the 
three on trial were black or hispanic and the victim was a white 
wall street executive 
supporters of the youths charged that the police were satisfied 
with the arrest of any minority suspect defense lawyers charged 
the defendants incriminating statements were the product of police 
lies and intimidation 
but miranda said the jury of four blacks four whites three 
hispanics and one asian never was split along racial lines during 
10 days of deliberations 
the defendants yusef salaam antron mccray and raymond santana 
were acquitted of the top count of attempted murder and a lesser 
count of sodomy 
salaam 16 mccray 16 and santana 15 were tried as adults 
but will be sentenced as juvenile offenders on sept 11 they face 
up to five to 10 years in prison on the top count of rape all 
three defense attorneys promised to appeal 
justice thomas galligan ordered them all jailed without bail 
three other defendants have yet to stand trial 
the defendants supporters demonstrated frequently outside the 
courthouse accusing the victim of promiscuity and questioning her 
reasons for being in the park late at night 
when prosecutor elizabeth lederer left the courthouse a group 
shouted the devil herself the devil shes going to pay for 
it 
lederers boss manhattan district attorney robert morgenthau 
denied any racial element in the case this city is illserved by 
those who have sought to exploit it and advance their own 
private agendas he said 
the brutal events which occurred at central park late one 
april night in 1989 seared the soul of every decent new yorker 
mayor david dinkins said in a statement we should recommit 
ourselves to building a city and forging a society in which such 
heinous crimes do not occur 
charles nestorick one of two jurors who agreed to talk with 
reporters after the verdict was read said the attempted murder 
charges gave us a lot of difficulty because she had really been 
beaten 
but he said the jurors felt the teens didnt realize how badly 
they had hurt her youths that age are not well versed in how 
many blows it takes to kill someone he said 
after three days of deliberating on nothing but the attempted 
murder charges we saw that we couldnt prove intent he said 
asked why it took 10 days for a verdict nestorick said one 
person held out to acquit mccray on rape and assault 
the defendants statements to police were the heart of the 
prosecutions case a detective testified that santana told him he 
counted 33 youths who entered the park to wild some joggers 
beat up and rip off joggers and cyclists 
the defendants told detectives the naked woman was struck with a 
metal pipe bashed in the head and face with a brick cut on the 
legs with a knife and sexually attacked lederer said 
the defendants also were convicted of firstdegree riot of 
assault and robbery in an attack on one male jogger and of 
assaulting a second man

former threeterm sen lawton chiles is being 
chased by questions about his health particularly his resumed use 
of the antidepressant drug prozac as he heads into the stretch of 
the democratic gubernatorial race 
since his surprise entry into the race in april chiles has been 
the frontrunner both to win the sept 4 primary and to unseat 
republican gov bob martinez in november but an initial lead of 30 
to 40 points over sixterm us rep bill nelson was down to 12 
points in polls last month 
and last month chiles disclosed that he had resumed taking 
prozac his use of the antidepressant was leaked to the news media 
as he entered the race but chiles had stopped taking it until 
recently 
i started experiencing some of the symptoms id seen before 
so i resumed the taking of it chiles said friday citing loss of 
appetite and sleeplessness 
theyre doing much better now he added 
nelsons running mate state house speaker tom gustafson 
suggested two weeks ago chiles could be a suicide risk in the 
governors mansion nelson distanced himself from the remark and 
gustafson eventually apologized 
questions about chiles use of prozac come as the 
antidepressant is the subject of lawsuits filed against its maker 
eli lilly amp co of indianapolis by users or their survivors 
linking the drug to violence and suicide 
eli lilly says the drug has been prescribed to more than 2 
million people and that extensive testing has shown no link to 
suicidal impulses 
during the campaigns first live television debate thursday 
nelson 47 renewed his call for chiles to release his medical 
records chiles agreed and said friday he has told his physician to 
assemble his medical files 
the 60yearold chiles who underwent quadruplebypass heart 
surgery in 1985 had balked at releasing records but he decided to 
release them in hopes of quieting any concerns about his health 
chiles said voters dont query him about his health while he is 
out campaigning i think they sort of look at me see the 
schedule im keeping and see how im doing he said 
with former us rep kenneth buddy mackay as his running 
mate chiles has sought to make bigmoney politics the issue he 
and mackay have long been among the states most respected 
politicians for integrity they have raised nearly 2 million while 
imposing a 100 limit on contributions 
nelson has raised 58 million and martinez has been running 
ahead of the democrats in funds 
the democratic campaign has gotten more heated in its final 
month with nelson raising ethics charges against chiles and 
chiles criticizing nelson for the politics of negativism and big 
money 
while chiles hopes voters will back him against what one of his 
ads terms the politics of the sewer nelson is pushing the 
health issue 
he wrote chiles on friday asking a timetable for the release of 
chiles medical records and campaign manager jay hakes said nelson 
will bring the disclosure issue up in their next televised debate 
friday if chiles still hasnt responded 
nelson and martinez both joggers made their medical records 
public months ago 
hakes said chiles health is a legitimate but delicate 
issue 
i dont think its really going to be appropriate to discuss 
prozac hakes said calling it too personal 
but the nelson campaign cites chiles own statement in december 
1987 that he was retiring from the senate because he was burned out 
nelson repeatedly talks about energy and vitality 
chiles said he didnt recognize his depression until after he 
left the senate he decided to retire when as senate budget 
chairman he became frustrated because senate politics were making 
it impossible to make headway toward reducing the federal deficit 
jm mac stipanovich martinezs sharptongued politic guru 
said he would have no reticence in highlighting chiles mental 
health 
lawton chiles by his own admission was incapable of continuing 
in public office he said by his own admission he suffered 
from clinical depression by his own admission while campaigning 
without the medication he couldnt sleep or function 
stipanovich said those admissions raise questions about how 
depressed chiles is 
theyre all fair questions and that has nothing to do with 
the morality of prozac or depression said stipanovich who said 
his own mother takes prozac that doesnt make him a bad person 
chiles insisted hes not worried that he is proving hes fit 
im sure theyll use anything against me he said chuckling

organizations ranging from law enforcement to religious groups have 
formed a coalition to battle nagging social ills in black 
communities 
the group calling itself the national association of black 
organizations grew out of a threeday summit conference of black 
organizations in washington assembled by the national association 
for the advancement of colored people 
coalition members which include groups as varied as the 
national organization of black law enforcement executives and the 
progressive national baptist convention will focus their efforts 
on such problems as teenage pregnancy school dropouts and other

communications network to share information development of a brain 
trust to research and make recommendations on social and economic 
concerns affecting blacks spreading of effective selfhelp 
initiatives and development of strategies to strengthen support 
for black institutions 
the naacp moves in a new direction with the formation of the 
coalition the nations preeminent civil rights organization has 
traditionally focused on legislation and litigation 
what we have accomplished here is but a beginning hooks 
said it marks the start of a new approach where the visible 
payoff is farther down the road 
hooks said the naacp does not intend to turn from its historical 
focus but he said the 81yearold group also realizes the need for 
black organizations to address problems facing blacks 
we as black people are stepping up to the bat and saying we 
are taking responsibility for our own destiny hooks said

may of the civilian workers from fort 
monmouth crowding into hannahs restaurant after work recently have 
been crying in their beer as well as quaffing it 
the 292 employees laid off from the army post were among some 
5400 at installations nationwide to receive pink slips in a 
continuing congressional effort to trim president bushs proposed 
307 billion defense budget 
fort monmouth with 8200 civilian and 2800 military workers 
provides hightech logistic support for military operations and has 
a research and development center for military electronics 
the army called the layoffs rif terminations for reduction in 
force 
no matter what theyre called carol locklin a fort monmouth 
secretary will be out of work effective oct 15 unless the rif 
is reversed 
we dont really have savings so to speak said the 
42yearold bricktown resident its going to really affect us if 
i dont find a job that pays as much money 
some members of the house and senate armed services committees 
have lobbied to shrink the defense forces citing the budget 
deficit and democratization of eastern europe 
the senate armed services committee wants to reduce the military 
force by 100000 and the house armed services committee wants it 
cut by 129500 the defense department said 
some fort employees hope the invasion of kuwait by iraq and the 
projected deployment of as many as 250000 military personnel to 
the middle east will give both houses of congress reason to 
reconsider proposed cutbacks 
bill eastburn a section chief in the forts computer controlled 
systemsautomatic data processing division said an rif notice he 
received in 1970 was retracted 
i keep telling other people my experience eastburn said 
i tell them dont jump off a bridge just hang in there now 
with the iraqi situation this may all be wiped out with a phone 
call or the stroke of a pen 
eastburns optimism finds some echo in congress 
i think whats going on now will bring some appreciation to 
members of keeping a ready reserve and a ready capability said 
alabama rep william dickinson the ranking republican on the house 
armed services committee we cant just slash defense spending 
and think everything will be ok the worlds just not like that 
president bush who had proposed cutting 37605 troops in his 
1991 budget request has cited the dispatch of us forces and 
materiel to the middle east in arguing against largescale defense 
cuts 
because congress has not decided how large the reduction in 
armed forces should be no termination notices have been given to 
enlisted staff said maj doug hart a pentagon public affairs 
officer 
through attrition retirement and a cutback in recruitment the 
number of troops in all branches of the service has fallen from 
212 million to 205 million in the 12 months ending june 30 
a hiring freeze mandated by secretary of defense dick cheney on 
jan 11 has helped shrink the civilian work force from 115 million 
at the end of 1989 to 113 million as of june 30 hart said 
layoffs for the militarys 1991 fiscal year which begins oct 
1 so far have exclusively affected army civilians he said 
at fort monmouth there had been talk of layoffs for weeks but 
when the division chief called mrs locklin to his office this 
month to say she would lose her 16000ayear job she was 
shocked the notification was dated aug 9 
the worst i thought they would do is move me or downgrade 
me mrs locklin said 
people at fort monmouth are running scared mrs locklin said 
theyre wondering am i next she said 
at hannahs manager chuck armstrong said the layoffs havent 
translated into reduced business 
everyone comes over to party after they get their pink 
slips said armstrong who keeps petitions to save fort monmouth 
jobs in the restaurant entrance

voters considered sunday whether to give a seat in 
the national parliament to a kgb renegade who says the soviet 
secret police still play dirty tricks and cling to stalinist 
repression 
a total of 20 candidates were running against former kgb agent 
oleg kalugin for a seat in the congress of peoples deputies from 
the southern russian province of krasnodar among them were 
cosmonaut anatoly berezovoi a veteran of a 211day space flight in 
1982 and gen vladimir sein political chief of the transcaucasian 
military district 
election commission officials in krasnodar said nearly 60 
percent of the 35 million eligible voters turned out to vote the 
winner was expected to be announced monday although a runoff may 
be necessary 
the kgb and its supporters tried hard to discredit kalugin 
before the election one resident of the region about 740 miles 
south of moscow on the black sea wrote to the arguments and facts 
weekly that rumors were circulating that people who voted for 
kalugin would be imprisoned 
kalugin worked as an operative in the united states from 
19581970 first under the cover of a radio moscow correspondent 
and later as a first secretary in the soviet embassy in washington 
kalugins recent charges of wiretapping smear campaigns and 
other dirty tricks have been a major thorn in the kgbs side while 
it is trying to improve its image many soviets associate the kgb 
and its predecessor agencies with the deaths of millions of people 
under dictator josef stalin in the 1930s and 1940s and exile 
beatings and imprisonment of dissidents through the early 1980s 
kalugin 55 focused renewed attention on the kgbs tarnished 
past and he claims its present when he went public in june he 
told foreign and soviet journalists that kgb agents are still 
tapping telephones infiltrating the russian orthodox church and 
labor unions and carrying out dirty tricks at the behest of their 
superiors he said the agency should be abolished 
at first the kgb rejected his charges as hostile and distorted 
and accused him of making them to further his own political 
ambitions later president mikhail s gorbachev stripped his 
military rank and decorations for compromising the honor and 
dignity of the state security organs 
the soviet prosecutor then began investigating kalugin under a 
law against divulging state secrets kalugin is fighting back with 
a lawsuit against gorbachev premier nikolai ryzhkov and kgb chief 
vladimir kryuchkov 
a member of the democratic platform reform movement kalugin is 
trying to gain a seat in the the national parliament that meets 
twice yearly the seat became vacant in june when ivan polozov left 
to become the communist party chief of the russian federation

hundreds of people who had fled this 
desert city near the saudikuwait border are returning because they 
believe the threat of attack by iraq has eased but some are still 
jittery 
khalid al otaishan the administrative head of the area said he 
had drawn up an evacuation plan that calls for 50000 people to 
move to a tent city should iraqi troops cross the border from 
kuwait 
we have warned the people al otaishan said in an interview 
outside the city government building that overlooks the persian 
gulf six saudi tanks could be seen parked in the desert several 
hundred yards away 
the governor said more saudi troops were stationed nearby but 
few could be seen in the city which resembled a ghost town in the 
midday sun 
handfuls of saudi soldiers prayed along the side of the road 
during regular moslem prayer times 
only one batch of american soldiers was spotted in the course of 
a day seven army men sat in a parked station wagon at the border 
checkpoint one studied a detailed map of the area 
i am sorry we cant talk to you the colonel in charge told 
an american reporter 
the americans were among a force of tens of thousands of troops 
deployed to the persian gulf region backed up by an array of 
planes and warships 
mursi abu bakr whose family owns the al khafji hotel was asked 
if he was worried about an invasion 
the first week we were now things are getting better and we 
work the best we can he said the arrival of american and other 
troops in the region provided somewhat of a sense of security he 
said 
but scott scheid of newport beach calif said the town only 
six miles from the border checkpoint was too close for comfort to 
occupied kuwait with its huge iraqi military contingent 
i dont think you want to be here if something starts up 
said scheid who works for an american oil company is based in 
khobar more than 180 miles to the south his company has evacuated 
its 19 local employees from khafji 
there is a lot of tension in the air said scheids 
coworker albert skiba of tuscon ariz 
khafji was flooded with kuwaiti refugees after the invasion 
for the first week it was terrible al otaishan said 
they needed too much food water 
the small oil town continues to serve as a magnet for those who 
flee across the desert from kuwait as well as for those awaiting 
word from relatives and friends still in kuwait 
iraq annexed the emirate six days after the invasion and 
baghdad has said kuwait is now irrevocably part of iraq

for anyone into yard sales it was 
handmedown heaven the us 127 corridor 450mile outdoor sale 
festival 
sunday marked the end of the fourth annual fourday fourstate 
roadside extravaganza which started thursday it stretched from 
covington ky and ended around gadsden ala passing through 
tennessee and georgia 
although there wasnt a continuous line of stalls along the 
entire route there was no shortage of tables and truckbeds to pick 
over and racks to browse through 
the festival is meant to help the economies of small towns and 
counties along us 127 by luring tourists off the interstates 
weve got beautiful scenery along 127 and its worth the drive 
even if you dont find any bargains said judy roysden of 
jamestown tenn 
she said the sale was promoted in tourist magazines and by 
tourism departments in kentucky and tennessee 
business slowed down toward the end the weekend after a brisk 
start on thursday and friday several dealers attributed the slump 
to travelers from northern states already having passed through 
george and june minor of louisville ky who were en route to 
the annual pioneer days festival in kentuckys mercer county said 
they didnt know about the yard sale event but were stopping at 
many of the stands 
george is crazy about yard sales june minor said 
by saturday afternoon some dealers were beginning to see 
travelers returning from the south their vans and cars loaded and 
their pockets empty 
rebekka seigel of owenton ky about 25 miles north of 
frankfort said a pennsylvania man had stopped to buy some marbles 
but lacked the money to pay for them 
his van was completely full she said 
the man pulled out a piece of pottery made in north carolina and 
asked if the seigels would trade they did and the man added 100 
marbles to his load 
his van would have been a real treat to go through she said

an iranian newspaper close to the 
government said sunday that tehran is prepared to ease tensions 
with iraq but will not help baghdad circumvent a multinational 
embargo 
iranian media also reported sunday that the withdrawal of 
thousands of iraqi troops from the iraqiiranian border will be 
completed by tuesday many of those troops are expected to be 
shifted to the iraqikuwait border where they will face us 
forces 
the englishlanguage tehran times which is close to iranian 
president hashemi rafsanjani said iraq demonstrated good will by 
offering wednesday to bring a formal end to the 19801988 iraniraq 
war a ceasefire halted the fighting two years ago 
the englishlanguage daily said tehran was well prepared to 
reciprocate any iraqi goodwill gesture but it denied suggestions 
that iran would help baghdad violate the economic sanctions imposed 
by the united nations the measures were enacted after iraq invaded 
kuwait on aug 2 iran has condemned the invasion 
the daily said western circles and us congressional 
quarters were voicing such concerns to drag iran into the 
current crisis 
it also stressed that iran will in no way pit itself in a war 
against iraq in order for the kuwaiti sheiks to return or for the 
sake of western interests in this part of the world 
irans official islamic republic news agency said sunday the 
iraqi troops blew up fortifications and laid minefields along the 
border as they withdrew 
as the threedayold pullout continued the biggest 
prisonerofwar exchange since world war ii gathered momentum after 
iraq began the longdelayed swap of soldiers captured in the 
persian gulf war 
iraqs army daily alqaddisiyah has reported that an 
unspecified number of the 30 divisions it said were deployed along 
the 730mile frontier with iran following the ceasefire will be 
sent south to confront us forces in saudi arabia 
the divisions contain an estimated total of about 300000 troops 
irans news agency quoted an unidentified iranian officer as 
saying that since the pullback of forces began friday iraq has 
withdrawn 90 percent of the forces that it had occupying an 
estimated 700 square miles of captured iranian territory the 
number of troops in that territory is unclear 
the withdrawal is part of the peace initiative with iran 
launched by iraqi president saddam hussein last week primarily 
aimed at securing his eastern flank in the confrontation with the 
united states 
in the pow exchanges irna said 3000 men were repatriated by 
iraq and 2000 by iran 
the agency quoted an unidentified foreign ministry spokesman in 
tehran as saying that the two countries have agreed to speed up the

iraq promised on sunday to free citizens 
of nations that are neutral in the persian gulf crisis but renewed 
threats to punish aggressive countries by using their nationals 
as a shield against attacks 
three thousand americans are among about 21000 westerners who 
were trapped by iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
in a series of statements on sunday baghdad promised to allow 
the nationals of five european countries to leave iraq and occupied 
kuwait but said it would use the other trapped foreigners 
including americans as protection against attacks on vital 
installations 
our people are seeking to avert a catastrophe president 
saddam hussein said in comments read by an announcer on iraqi 
television the presence of the foreigners with iraqi families at 
vital targets might prevent an attack 
saddam demanded the withdrawal of us and other forces deployed 
to protect saudi arabia and called for an end to the international 
embargo against iraq 
when those conditions were met he said all foreigners would be 
free to go 
iraqs treatment of the foreigners was denounced by western 
governments 
france said sunday it had been informed by the iraqis that 27 of 
its nationals in iraq and kuwait had been taken from their hotels 
to undisclosed locations it protested the move and ordered its 
naval commanders in the persian gulf to firmly enforce the united 
nations embargo 
spains foreign minister francisco fernandez ordonez called 
saddams threats absolutely unacceptable there are 184 
spaniards in iraq and kuwait 
britain which has about 4000 citizens in iraq and kuwait has 
accused baghdad of using outlaw tactics in its treatment of 
foreigners 
the white house on saturday said iraqs holding american and 
other foreign citizens is totally unacceptable and denounced 
the use of innocent civilians as pawns 
late saturday the un security council unanimously demanded 
that iraq let all foreigners leave 
baghdad said sunday it would allow citizens from five countries 
to leave iraq and occupied kuwait as a goodwill gesture 
because their governments had not sent aggressive forces to the 
region 
the official iraqi news agency quoted sadi mehdi saleh the 
speaker of the iraqi parliament as saying austrian swiss 
swedish finnish and portuguese would be allowed to leave iraq 
those nationals account for fewer than 600 of the stranded 
westerners they included 160 swedes 48 finns 140 swiss 140 
austrians and 100 portugese 
the news agency quoted saleh as saying the national council or 
parliament would consider allowing citizens of other countries 
neutral in the crisis to leave as well 
saddam whose broadcast message was monitored in nicosia called 
on the un security council to guarantee a withdrawal of us and 
other western forces from the region 
he suggested saudi arabia be given assurances the security 
council would coordinate collective military action against 
iraq if it attacked the kingdom 
under what the iraqi agency described as saddams peace 
initiative the security council also was to guarantee regional 
security on the basisof our previous initiative 
that was a reference to an earlier offer from saddam linking a 
possible withdrawal from kuwait to israels withdrawal from 
occupied arab territories and a syrian withdrawal from lebanon 
saddam said the kuwait crisis should be left for arabs to 
tackle as an arab issue and denounced the united states and 
britain as the chief obstacles to peace 
let us cooperate to prevent these governments from committing 
major crimes which will result in an inferno and an 
insurmountable flood of fire he said 
he said the detention of foreigners was meant to prevent 
death murder and starvation that he said would result from 
american policy thus he said holding the foreigners was a 
service to humanity 
earlier sunday iraq ordered westerners in three cities in 
occupied kuwait to report to hotels in the kuwaiti capital he 
issued veiled threats against anyone who disobeyed 
anyone who does not comply will together with his government 
bear full responsibility for any undesirable action that might be 
targeted against them by hostile elements said the news agency 
monitored in nicosia 
it was the second such asssembly order in four days on 
thursday american and british nationals in kuwait were ordered to 
report to hotels but no iraqi officials were there to meet the few 
who showed up 
britains foreign office said it was told by the iraqis that 
those who report to the hotels would be taken to key 
installations in kuwait and iraq while those who did not report 
to the hotels would be rounded up and taken straight to the sites 
it repeated its advice to britons to stay home and not to 
resist if confronted by iraqi troops 
iraq said friday it was detaining citizens of aggressive 
countries and placing them in areas that would be likely targets 
in the event of a us attack such as iraqi oil installations on 
saturday iraq said foreigners along with iraqis would suffer any 
shortages provoked by unimposed economic sanctions

a plan to ration services provided by 
oregons medicaid program to ensure that basic health care is 
available to the largest number of people has fallen more than a 
year behind schedule 
approved by the legislature in 1989 the program is the nations 
first to consider eliminating expensive or ineffective treatments 
for medicaid patients instead of providing total care as most 
states do 
a key to the program is an effort to establish a priority 
ranking of medical procedures that will be used to draw the line on 
medicaid spending 
but that effort encountered criticism when an initial ranking 
put crooked teeth near the top of its list and aids treatment near 
the bottom 
moreover critics say any reduction in medicaid coverage sets a 
dangerous precedent 
but state medicaid director jean thorne says health care costs 
are increasing at an alarming rate and she would far prefer to 
ration services than reduce the number of people who qualify for 
medicaid 
we constantly hear weve got to do something well 
theres no way we can attack this problem without being 
controversial she said if the critics dont have anything 
better to offer why not let us try this 
major health coverage celebrated its silver anniversary just 
last month on july 30 1965 president lyndon johnson signed into 
law medicare and medicaid its companion health plan for the poor 
medical spending increased from 38 billion in 1965 to 70 
billion in 1970 by 1980 health care costs had reached 236 
billion 
in 1983 the program was retooled payments to doctors and 
hospitals decreased and what constitutes the poor was redefined 
in oregon that meant a 6yearold whose parents earn 575 a 
month was entitled to a heart transplant but if the familys 
income totaled 576 a month that child could not get so much as a 
booster shot 
even so the states medicaid budget increased from 250 million 
during the 198587 biennium to 520 million during the current 
twoyear budget period according to thorne 
thats a 106 percent increase in funding but the number of 
people covered has increased by only 33 percent thorne said 
if were going to increase spending lets spread the money 
around more equitably 
the medicaid rationing program approved by the 1989 
legislature originally was to have begun on july 1 but state 
officials now concede there is little chance it will be ready by 
july 1 1991 
an 11member panel of doctors health care administrators and 
consumers has been poring over the priority list since september 
they spent months devising a mathematical formula that would weigh 
the cost of a medical procedure against the severity of an illness 
and the benefit of treatment 
detection and prevention of aids was high on the list but 
treatment for aids when a patient is close to death is near the 
bottom so are liver and bone marrow transplants which can run 
into the hundreds of thousands of dollars 
 
thumb sucking was 37th ahead of croup and congenital syphilis 
thats because common ailments like thumb sucking are easily 
treated at a relatively low cost 
the first draft was a data dump said paige sipesmetzler 
executive director of the oregon health services commission 
there will be another draft possibly more than one but for the 
time being we have something to work with 
in june the panel split into two subcommittees each taking a 
different approach to the priority list 
the panel has postponed until september any further decision on 
a ranking method meanwhile no deadline has been set for the next 
draft of the priority list 
we felt it was more important to get an extension of the 
deadline than to produce a list that doesnt work said 
sipesmetzler adding its never going to be a perfect list or 
satisfy everybody but at least people will understand it

the defense attorneys who won an acquittal for 
claus von bulow say they have new evidensein the jeffrey macdonald 
case the subject of the bestselling book fatal vision 
boston attorneys harvey silverglate and alan dershowitz plan to 
file a writ of habeas corpus to overturn the conviction of 
macdonald a green beret found guilty of murdering his wife and two 
daughters 22 years ago the motion is due to be filed in us 
district court in raleigh nc sometime late next month or early 
october 
silverglate said last week that his team has uncovered forensic 
evidence in the highly publicized case that he says was hidden by 
the government during macdonalds trial and subsequent appeal he 
did not describe the evidence but said it corroborates a claim by a 
woman now dead who allegedly had told others she participated in 
the killings 
had it been available to jeffrey macdonald prior to the trial 
he would have been acquitted said silverglate it will 
demonstrate that the story he told on the night of the murders was 
true 
macdonald a princetoneducated army doctor was convicted in 
1979 of the bludgeoning and stabbing deaths of his pregnant wife 
colette and two small daughters kimberly and kristen at their 
fort bragg nc apartment in february 1970 
macdonald has maintained from the beginning that he and his 
family were attacked in their home by three men accompanied by a 
woman with hat blond hair and boots he said the woman 
chanted acid is groovy kill the pigs 
james blackburn who prosecuted the 1979 case said sunday he 
has been hearing the writ would be filed for more than a year 
they have made that claim for a long time that they were going 
to file those motions he said in a telephone interview from his 
home in raleigh where he is now an attorney once they are 
filed i or the appropriate authorities will file a response 
during the trial certainly absolutely no evidence was hidden 
from the defense that they were entitled to he added 
macdonald 46 is currently serving three consecutive life 
sentences at the terminal island federal penitentiary in san pedro 
calif he was transferred there from a phoenix prison three years 
ago to be near his mother dorothy macdonald who is in poor health 
i shouldnt be in prison said macdonald in a telephone 
interview from prison friday im going to keep fighting i 
would never give up and just remain quietly in prison i need to be 
vindicated 
macdonald asked silverglate to take his case in 1983 and called 
him again last year with the new evidence macdonald working from 
prison with a network of outside investigators and supporters 
uncovered the new evidence said attorney phil cormier part of the 
defense team 
macdonalds case has followed a surreal zigzag course through 
the years though he was originally a suspect in the case the army 
cleared him of charges after the longest pretrial hearing in 
military history he moved to huntington beach calif and took a 
job as an emergency physician at a long beach hospital 
his fatherinlaw freddy kassab initially his staunchest 
supporter turned bitterly against him and conducted a virtual 
crusade against him kassabs persistence led in part to 
macdonalds eventual indictment in 1975 macdonald was tried and 
convicted of the crimes in 1979 
a onetime suspect in the case helena stoeckley a chronic drug 
abuser allegedly confessed to the crimes to various people on 
several occasions the testimony of those people to whom stoeckley 
allegedly confessed was not allowed during the trial stoeckley 
died in 1983 
silverglate said the new evidence links both stoeckley and 
others to the crime scene and corroborates the testimony she gave 
witnesses for the first time 
author joe mcginniss wrote the bestselling 1983 book fatal 
vision in which he concluded macdonald was guilty of the 
murders the book was made into a highly rated television movie 
macdonald later sued mcginniss claiming the author lied to gain 
his confidence and write the book macdonald won a 325000 
outofcourt settlement but was allowed to keep just 50000 
macdonald said he is convinced he will finally be vindicated 
once the new evidence is made public 
then i can home and rebuild my life he said 
blackburn characterized the legal maneuvering as another in a 
long series of attempts by macdonald to deny that he was in fact 
involved when a trial jury found he was guilty 
dershowitz and silvergate made the celebrated defense of claus 
von bulow who in 1985 was acquitted in rhode island of trying to 
murder his heiress wife martha sunny von bulow von bulow had 
been convicted three years earlier

police said sunday that 49 
blacks were killed in weekend tribal fighting waged with clubs 
machetes and spears bringing the death toll in a week of violence 
to 291 
soldiers were sent in to assist police in tokoza and other 
townships east of johannesburg where battles broke out a week ago 
between xhosas and zulus the countrys two largest black tribes 
despite the increased security presence 49 blacks were killed 
in tokoza and five neighboring townships from saturday morning 
through sunday night said police spokeswoman lt ida van zweel 
some victims were ritually castrated and had their hands cut 
off corpses were burned so badly police could not determine if the 
deceased were men or women 
at least 213 blacks have died in tokoza and neighboring 
townships since aug 12 another 78 blacks have been killed in 
soweto township southwest of johannesburg during the same period 
xhosas on sunday looted a deserted migrant workers hostel in 
tokoza that had been occupied by thousands of zulus a week earlier 
smoke rose from one hostel building that had been set alight 
police fired tear gas and shotguns to drive off looters but 
when the police left the looters returned piling refrigerators 
stoves and other items into cars and pickup trucks 
there were scattered clashes and at least one zulu was killed 
sunday morning witnesses said some zulus returned to the hostel 
to pick up their possessions 
they are trying to kill me one zulu man said of the xhosas 
it is a war 
more than 6000 armed zulus remained at hostels in other parts 
of tokoza police said 
has the descent into a beirutstyle apocalypse begun asked 
the sunday times the countrys largestcirculation newspapaper 
in countless white homes families watched the carnage and 
wondered if it would ever be possible to share power with people 
who regard the panga machete and the knobkerrie club as tools 
of political expression the newspaper said in a frontpage 
editorial 
the fighting appears to be mostly a tribal conflict with a long 
history but it also has political overtones 
nelson mandela and many other leaders of the african national 
congress the largest opposition movement are xhosas the rival 
inkatha movement is a zulubased organization headed by mangosuthu 
buthelezi 
according to local media reports sunday an anc leader walter 
sisulu blamed inkatha for the violence but buthelezi denied the 
allegation 
it only stokes the violence when he sisulu indulges in war 
talk buthelezi said its nonsense to say that inkatha has 
imported the violence 
mandela and buthelezi are old friends and both have repeatedly 
called for an end to black faction fighting that has plagued the 
eastern province of natal for five years and now is spreading to 
the johannesburg area 
but the two men have not met since mandela was released from 
prison in february after serving 27 years for plotting to overthrow 
the whiteled government 
city press the countrys largest blackoriented weekly printed 
an open letter to mandela and buthelezi urging them to hold 
immediate peace talks 
like millions of other black people i cannot understand why 
you mandela refuse to talk to dr buthelezi when at the drop of 
a hat you meet and talk to president fw de klerk wrote the 
papers editor khulu sibiya 
i also fail to understand why in this century you buthelezi 
still encourage tribalism among your people sibiya added 
both the anc and inkatha oppose apartheid the system of racial 
segregation that allows the 5 million whites to maintain political 
and economic control over the 30 million blacks 
however the two blackled groups differ over tactics the anc 
has favored confrontational tactics such as boycotts and strikes 
but recently agreed to suspend its ineffective armed struggle 
against the government 
the relatively conservative inkatha movement has never endorsed 
those methods and favors capitalism as opposed to the 
socialistoriented anc

the sailors aboard this guided

young sailors closely studying an array of video screens puff on

aboard his ship 
in the darkened hightech combat intelligence center that is 
the warships nerve center sailors peer at giant circular screens 
marked with neon symbols they keep track of any air sea or 
underwater threat to them or their lead ship 
its a little like being an air traffic controller in new york 
city or chicago corcoran says these guys are playing an 
enormous video game with life or death consequences 
the threat of missiles mines or enemy aircraft could bring 
death to those aboard the battle group as it spreads across this 
vital shipping lane on the eastern coast of saudi arabia 
corcoran shows cheney the rooms wide array of computers and 
weaponry guidance systems as he introduces young sailors who man 
some of the worlds most potent weapons 
memories of past tragedies are in everyones mind as cheney 
views the closein weapons system control panel which directs a 
highspeed cannon 
its a lastditch weapon but its so fast it can shoot the 
missiles right out of the sky ltjg daryl hancock tells the 
defense secretary 
they didnt use it on the stark he said recalling the may 
1987 incident in which an iraqi exocet missile inadvertently hit 
the uss stark killing 32 american sailors

its crew of 5200 or other us ships and their crews 
corcorans ship and the eisenhower battle group have been at sea 
since march once the alert was sounded after iraqs aug 2

arm and supply itself for passage through the suez canal and into 
the persian gulf 
posted where it can stop ships entering or leaving the crucial 
jordanian port of aqaba the scott became one of the first ships to 
play an active role in president bushs interception of iraqi 
shipping 
aqaba has been the one loophole through which iraq has 
transported goods since a united nationsmandated trade embargo 
began 
most ships encountered by the scott have been empty or posed no 
problem corcoran says but a cypriot freighter carrying aluminum 
chromate and other chemicals bound for aqaba was told not to 
continue and turned back after an hour of radio communications the 
captain says 
corcoran describes his crew as very very alert but very 
confident and relaxed about what theyre doing

they are involved in an international struggle for control of the 
worlds oil reserves 
speaking of iraqi leader saddam hussein cheney says if he 
succeeds hell control the world economy 
its tough hard dirty duty cheney says but it is an 
enormously important deployment this may be one of the most 
important moments for this nation for the rest of this century

the armed forces chief sunday warned of a 
renewed crackdown on leftists saying guerrillas have infiltrated 
the military and planned a wave of attacks 
subversion is a reality in honduras said armed forces chief 
arnulfo cantarero lopez in an interview with the associated press 
and to counteract this the country could return to the era of 
the doctrine of national security 
cantarero lopez was referring to the period from 19821984 when 
the armed forces then led by gen gustavo alvarez martinez 
followed a policy of detaining leftists in advance of attacks 
human rights organizations have accused the armed forces of 
killing about 300 people and causing the disappearance of 150 
others during that period 
alvarez martinez was shot to death in 1988 by the cinchonero 
popular liberation movement cantarero lopez 44 took over the 
post in january 
in the interview he said the armed forces have been 
infiltrated by leftist guerrillas who are now trying to obtain 
resources to finance a wave of terrorism in honduras 
the general interviewed in the city of omoa 180 miles north of 
tegucigalpa suggested the leftists could be financed by 
international drug trafficking 
this is logical because traditionally honduras has been used 
as a trampoline for drug traffic between colombia and the united 
states he said 
he did not specify what national security measures the 
22000member army might take 
but he said the armed forces will do everything possible to 
block the communists from taking power in our nation and in 
this fight we hope to count on the aid of our people 
the armed forces are vulnerable and have been infiltrated 
by subversion said cantarero lopez military intelligence has 
detected numerous cases of guerrilla infiltration 
he said a foiled bank robbery on aug 15 in el zamorano 18 
miles east of tegucigalpa was the work of the cinchoneros 
no group has admitted attempting that robbery which resulted in 
the deaths of six alleged guerrillas three policemen a bank guard 
and two other people six security agents were injured 
the native guerrillas have been strengthened by the return of 
numerous honduran leftists who for the past decade were in exile in 
nicaragua cantarero lopez said the local insurgents have been 
trained for the past 10 years in the soviet union cuba and libya 
because of that they are well consolidated 
we dont want to frighten the people but the genesis of 
leftist violence has already been introduced in honduras he said 
the cinchoneros rose in honduras in 1979 as an armed wing of the 
communist party which has operated clandestinely since 1920

engineers continued to read data from 
magellans memory banks sunday looking for clues as to why the 
unmanned space probe temporarily lost contact with earth during its 
mission around venus 
franklin odonnell a spokesman for the jet propulsion 
laboratory in pasadena said the process of reading the crafts 
computer memory would take another four or five days 
were only getting data at 40 bits per second odonnell 
said usually we read it at some thousand bits per second 
in order to regain solid communication with magellan ground 
engineers commanded the craft to point a secondary antenna at 
earth odonnell said 
magellans secondary antenna sends a much broader radio beam 
than the main antenna but it sends data at a slower 40 bits per 
second so unloading magellans memory banks proceeded at a crawl 
but the contact with magellan was quite solid odonnell 
said 
the engineers lost contact with magellan thursday night just 
after it bounced radar waves off venus for a test and sent the 
information to earth 
they already know the malfunction made one of magellans 
computers stop sending signals called heartbeats to another 
computer said david okerson a magellan engineer assigned to jpl 
that spurred magellan to put itself into a series of protective 
safety modes that cut off contact with earth then sent radio 
signals across the heavens in a long effort to restore its radio 
link with controllers 
a steady hookup was reestablished friday night after nearly 15 
hours of no radio contact followed by eight hours of intermittent 
contact 
the spacecraft administered cpr to itself okerson said 
these protection mechanisms just saved our bacon 
jet propulsion laboratory spokeswoman mary beth murrill said the 
time needed to diagnose and fix the problem likely would delay the 
planned aug 29 start of magellans mission to use radar to map 
venus cloudcovered surface 
normal contact with magellan would be restored after it is 
ordered to leave the safety mode point its main antenna at earth 
and send data at a higher speed scientists hope to do that this 
week 
magellan was launched from the shuttle atlantis on its 744 
million venus exploration mission on may 4 1989 it went into 
orbit around venus aug 10 after a circuitous trip of 948 million 
miles

volunteers to various locations including the middle east since 
aug 8 
thirty unit members were sent to saudi arabia said adj gen 
joseph skaff state secretary for public safety 
skaff who commands the air guard and the states army national 
guard said most of the rest were filling in at us bases for 
regular troops deployed to the middle east 
the group based in this northeastern west virginia town is 
comprised mainly of west virginians but includes members from 
nearby maryland pennsylvania and virginia 
no one around here is saying anything said garza 42 as he 
served food on a slowerthanusual friday i havent really heard 
much about it and were familiar and close to a lot of them 
air guard members quickly volunteered for duty after iraq 
invaded kuwait and the united states began moving troops to the 
region their response carried on a patriotic tradition said jack 
koch a retired air national guard colonel and former air commander 
of the 167th 
west virginia has on a per capita basis more medal of honor 
winners than any other state koch said it also has the greatest 
number of war volunteers and the highest number of war casualties 
on a per capita basis 
there are few outward signs of the mobilization around this 
prosperous town of 14000 where many residents commute to work in 
washington residents are as likely to shrug as to answer when 
asked about the callup 
before it was communism now its oil said jim mahares 40 
as he tended his hot dog stand on the towns main street 
no one has said a single thing to me about this said f 
page burdette editor of the morning journal we have received no 
letters to the editor no phone calls nothing 
now if you ask them what do you think about gas prices going 
up thats different burdette said theyre thinking about 
their pocketbooks 
national guard members from at least 21 states are part of the 
us mobilization 
the pentagon has refused to say how many guardsmen were 
deployed but information from state capitals indicates that more 
than 1000 air crew members technicians communications experts 
and medical personnel have volunteered for duty 
skaff said west virginia guardsmen and their aircraft could be 
close to the fighting if a shooting war breaks out

two influential democratic congressmen said 
sunday that us warships should fire on iraqi vessels that ignore 
orders to stop even if that meant an act of war against iraq 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee said us warships should be prepared to fire on ships 
that try to break the embargo against iraq 
i think thats what a blockade is all about aspin said on 
nbctvs meet the press program you give people ample 
warning to stop and to be searched and to be checked out and then 
if they dont then of course you proceed to try and disable the 
ship 
us navy vessels in the persian gulf region fired warning shots 
at two iraqi oil tankers saturday following president bushs 
orders thursday to interdict shipments in and out of iraq using 
the minimum force necessary 
the oil tankers proceeded without stopping and were being 
monitored by us warships the pentagon said it knew nothing about 
a claim by the official iraqi news agencys of a third firing 
sunday 
rep lee hamilton dind chairman of the house middle east 
subcommittee said any firing on an iraqi vessel would be an act 
of war under international law 
hamilton said that if bush orders ships to open fire i 
believe that the congress will support the president 
the white house dismissed an offer by iraqi president saddam 
hussein to release westerners held since the aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait if bush offers written guarantees that us forces will be 
withdrawn from saudi arabia and the economic boycott against iraq 
is ended 
it seems were getting a daily seminar of iraqi ridicule these 
days said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater he said the 
latest iraqi proposal doesnt have much relationship to our 
objective and contains no new relevant proposals and makes no 
reference to the united nations and arab league calls for them to 
leave kuwait 
washington has insisted that us military action in the middle 
east will end only after saddam removes his troops from kuwait and 
the ousted kuwaiti government is restored to power 
fitzwater commented on air force one as bush was returning to 
washington from his maine vacation home sunday afternoon for a 
meeting with national security adviser brent scowcroft 
in related news sunday 
undersecretary of state for political affairs robert kimmitt 
said on the nbc program that there was no confirmation yet the 
iraqis were carrying through on threats to move americans and other 
foreigners to vital targets to deter a us attack he said the 
state department was urging the estimated 3000 americans trapped 
in iraq and occupied kuwait to stay in their homes but not to 
resist if iraqi authorities try to move them 
cbs news quoting a us consular official in baghdad reported 
that 35 americans have been taken to us diplomatic quarters in 
the iraqi capital a state department official asked about the 
report said we cant comment on that at this time 
iraqi ambassador to the united states mohammed sadiq almashat 
interviewed on abctvs this week with david brinkley program 
rejected suggestions that iraq was violating international norms by 
refusing to allow americans and other westerners to leave iraq and 
kuwait 
when you deny our children food and milk what do you 
expect he said adding that the united states should work for 
peace rather than beating the drums of war because we are on 
the brink of a catastrophe for everybody 
sen ted stevens ralaska said defense secretary dick cheney 
has asked transportation secretary samuel skinner to authorize the 
use of armed coast guard personnel for boarding ships in the 
persian gulf region but a coast guard spokesman lt cmdr kim 
krzywicki said the agency had heard nothing about such an 
assignment 
the white house has shied away from referring to us navy 
action in the middle east as a blockade but hamilton also 
speaking on nbc said i think the lawyers may quibble about these 
words but i dont think the public does 
hamilton and aspin cautioned however that bush will not have 
support for use of military force against iraq unless iraqi 
president saddam hussein escalates the current war of nerves 
the key is that the president and the congress must not move 
too far out in front of the consensus both domestic and 
international hamilton said

the air force showed off its oncesecret 
stealth fighter sunday as 22 of the attack planes headed toward the 
mideast in a show of force intended to warn iraq of us air 
superiority 
reporters were invited to langley air force base to view the 
f117a planes as they landed here en route to joining the military 
buildup in the persian gulf 
the united states has said the buildup is defensive and intended 
to assure that the iraqis who invaded kuwait on aug 2 dont 
attempt further military adventures 
col anthony tolin until recently a wing commander of the 
stealth fighters which are based at nellis air fore base in 
nevada acknowledged the f117a is not a defensive weapon 
i guess it would be tough to classify the f117a as a purely 
defensive weapon its defensive nature is its ability to penetrate 
enemy radar without detection tolin said 
he said the presence of the planes in the gulf could be an 
important psychological weapon 
they give us an ability should we need it to get in with the 
least amount of casualties and attack those important targets if 
necessary tolin said 
the planes are scheduled to leave for the gulf monday afternoon 
the air force has already sent f15 fighter planes and a10s 
since iraq moved on kuwait and massed troops on kuwaits border 
with saudi arabia the a10 is a ground support aircraft designed 
to take out tanks and other armored vehicles 
tolin said the stealth fighter was designed to penetrate enemy 
defenses to locate high priority targets and to deliver 
ordinance 
the plane was once considered so secret the air force flew it 
only at night on test missions high above the nevada desert the 
plane was designed and built by lockheed cos supersecret skunk 
works in burbank ca the air force says it has 56 of the planes 
the f117a and the newer b2 stealth bomber got their stealth 
nickname because they are designed to be nearly invisible to radar 
the f117a has seen combat only once when they bombed a target 
using laserguided bombs during the december 1989 panama invasion 
tolin left his job as commander of the 37th tactical fighter 
wing at nellis two days ago he is now assistant deputy chief of 
staff of the tactical air command at langley 
the planes began landing shortly after 330 pm about the size 
of an f15 the ungainly matte black jets gently settled onto the 
runway and slowed with the help of a drogue chute 
at 426 million per plane not including the research and 
development costs the fighters are one of the worlds most 
expensive planes 
tolin said the planes are remarkably easy to fly but was 
closemouthed about the planes capabilities and armament 
he was more talkative about the planes odd appearance 
im often asked how i can love something this ugly he said 
as another f117a landed tom clancy the author gave me a good 
story that can explain it 
the scottish wolfhound is considered the ugliest dog in all of 
scotland but the owners of scottish wolfhounds are always quick to 
point out that there are no wolves in scotland 
clancy is the author of the hunt for red october and other 
thrillers with military themes

bf skinner one of the centurys 
leading psychologists who believed human behavior could be 
engineered to build a better world died saturday of leukemia at 
age 86 
he was the patriarch of the school of thought known as 
behaviorism and the inventor of the skinner box a tool he used 
to demonstrate his theory that rewarded behavior is repeated 
while remembered by many and sometimes scorned for teaching 
pigeons to play pingpong and guide missiles his book walden 
two was required reading for a generation of college students in 
the 1960s and 1970s 
burrhus frederic skinner views were based on his principle of 
operant behavior the idea that seemingly spontaneous action is 
regulated through rewards and punishment 
many psychologists disagreed with his theories 
but his application of the ideas of the russian physiologist 
ivan pavlov left an indelible stamp on american society parents 
use his operant conditioning each time they praise a behavior 
they want and punish one they dont want

saddam hussein offered on sunday to free all foreigners in iraq 
and kuwait if the united states promises to withdraw its forces 
from saudi arabia and guarantees that an international economic 
embargo will be lifted 
us and british officials dismissed the initiative 
as a goodwill gesture iraq said it will immediately free all 
detainees from austria switzerland sweden finland and portugal 
those countries account for fewer than 600 of the 21000 westerners 
who have been trapped in kuwait and iraq for the last three weeks 
when the abovementioned items are met we will use our 
constitutional powers to allow all the foreigners to travel out of 
iraq each according to his wish the official iraqi news agency 
quoted the iraqi president as saying 
in the meantime saddam said the remaining foreign captives 
including 3000 americans will be held at vital iraqi targets to 
avoid the flood of fire that will result if usled forces 
attack iraq 
cbs news reported from baghdad on sunday that 35 americans 
including four women and three children have taken refuge at us 
diplomatic quarters in the iraqi capital it did not specify 
what it meant by quarters 
the report quoted the officer in charge of the us embassy in 
baghdad joseph wilson as saying he and his staff were doing 
everything possible to prevent americans from being rounded up by 
iraqi authorities 
asked about the report a spokesman at the state department 
said we cant make a comment on that at this time 
one of the refugeseeking americans vivian hill of orlando 
fla told cbs that her biggest concern was that it could get 
worse we could be taken from here i wouldnt be surprised weve 
contemplated that happening 
cbs also reported that some other americans had been taken from 
a baghdad hotel and dispersed as human shields at strategic 
locations including a sulphuric acid plant at al qaim munitions 
and chemical sites in baiji and taji and a chemical and artillery 
production facility at al iskandariyah 
saddams statement also carried on iraqi television was 
described as an open letter to the families of the detained 
foreigners 
it was saddams second attempt to negotiate an end to the 
persian gulf crisis since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 in a 
dispute over oil money and territory he later annexed the 
oilrich nation 
earlier saddam had linked an iraqi withdrawal from kuwait with 
an israeli pullout from its occupied territories and a syrian 
withdrawal from lebanon 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater dismissed the latest 
iraqi proposal 
it seems were getting a daily seminar of iraqi ridicule these 
days said fitzwater who was traveling on air force one en route 
from kennebunkport maine to washington 
he said the iraqi proposal doesnt have much relationship to 
our objective and contains no new relevant proposals and makes no 
reference to the united nations and arab league calls for them to 
leave kuwait 
when president bush sent thousands of troops to defend saudi 
arabia against a possible iraqi attack he also demanded that iraqi 
troops unconditionally withdraw from kuwait and restore its 
monarchy to power 
in london a british foreign office spokesman also dismissed 
saddams latest initiative saying it doesnt represent any real 
progress at all 
saddam gave a lengthy justification sunday for the invasion and 
reiterated iraqs longstanding claims to kuwait 
earlier iraqi announcements have ordered westerners living in 
iraq and kuwait to report to specific hotels prompting fears they 
will be interned iraq also has said that foreign babies and 
elderly people will be the first to suffer if the embargo results 
in food and medicine shortages in iraq 
thomas r pickering the us ambassador to the united nations 
said on saturday that saddam has made it clear he intends to hold 
hostage all foreigners us officials previously had avoided 
using the word hostage 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar meanwhile 
dispatched two senior un officials to baghdad to urge iraqi 
officials to free its detainees perez de cuellar said saddam had 
sent a letter requesting that the envoys be sent but he did not 
elaborate 
the united states and the other four permanent members of the 
un security council met sunday at the french mission in new york 
and explored the possibility of joint military action under the 
un charter western diplomats said 
the meeting was inconclusive but some members felt the council 
should move toward some kind of military action said a diplomat 
who spoke on condition of anonymity informal private consultations 
of the council were likely monday 
the united states is pouring thousands of soldiers into saudi

bf skinner one of the centurys 
leading psychologists who believed human behavior could be 
engineered to build a better world died of leukemia he was 86 
skinner died saturday at mount auburn hospital in this 
university city a hospital administrator said 
he was the patriarch of the school of thought known as 
behaviorism and the inventor of the skinner box a tool he used 
to demonstrate his theory that rewarded behavior is repeated 
while remembered by many and sometimes scorned for teaching 
pigeons to play pingpong and guide missiles his novel walden 
two was required reading for a generation of college students in 
the 1960s and 1970s 
he was certainly the leading psychologist of his time said 
richard herrnstein a psychology professor at harvard who knew 
skinner for 38 years 
burrhus frederic skinner bf to the world fred to his 
friends spent most of his career at harvard where he applied his 
observations of animals to the motives and manipulation of human 
conduct 
skinners views were based on his principle of operant 
behavior the idea that seemingly spontaneous action is regulated 
through rewards and punishment people dont shape the world he 
said the world shapes them 
in the months leading up to his death skinner remained active 
preparing a defense of his research that explored the uses of 
positive and negative reinforcement to improve human behavior 
i will be dead in a few months he said in an interview last 
month but it hasnt given me the slightest anxiety or worry or 
anything i always knew i was going to die 
skinner believed that human behavior is predictable just like a 
chemical reaction since people were run through their paces by 
their environment behavioral technology could put them to work 
to create a happy and safe world free of overpopulation war and 
pollution 
many psychologists disagreed with his theories of his 
contemporaries skinner once said i can mention only one or two 
who really very seriously changed their attitudes toward the study 
of behavior as a result of anything i have ever done or said 
but his application of the ideas of the russian physiologist 
ivan pavlov left an indelible stamp on american society parents 
use his operant conditioning each time they praise a behavior 
they want and punish one they dont want 
skinners work was opposed to that of the cognitive 
psychologists who emphasize the unconscious structures of the 
human mind that are unaffected by conditioning skinner saw no 
difference between brain and mind 
what he did was decry psychological theory and place the 
emphasis on what behavior could be observed said albert ullman 
a retired professor of sociology at tufts university in medford 
skinner in his later years a lean man with a finefeatured 
patrician face beneath a broad expanse of forehead was born march 
20 1904 in susquehanna pa the elder son of grace burrhus an 
amateur musician and william skinner a lawyer 
after majoring in english at hamilton college in clinton ny 
skinner decided he wanted to be a writer he sent some short 
stories to the poet robert frost who wrote back you are worth 
twice anyone else i have seen in prose this year 
skinner went to manhattans greenwich village to work on his 
craft but after a year or so gave it up i discovered the unhappy 
fact that i had nothing to say he recalled and went on to 
graduate study in psychology hoping to remedy that shortcoming 
he was attracted to the work of john b watson the founder of 
behaviorism and earned his doctorate from harvard in 1931 he 
taught at the university of minnesota and indiana university before 
joining the harvard faculty in 1947 
it was at harvard that the lifelong tinkerer devised the 
skinner box a soundproof enclosure with buttons or levers that 
animals press to receive food in return for doing whatever the 
experimentor wants them to do 
the box provides a precise way to observe record and measure 
behavior it is widely used by psychologists many of whom are not 
skinnerians as well as by drug researchers who watch the way 
animals react to new medicines 
skinner preferred to call his invention an operant 
conditioning apparatus he employed it to teach rats and later 
pigeons to perform amazing tricks birds learned to play the 
piano walk in figure eights and dance 
table tennis though might have carried things too far asked 
once what he would do differently if given the chance he replied 
just one thing i performed one experiment that has never 
ceased to reverberate ive been laughed at by enemies and kidded 
by friends if i could do it all over again id never teach those 
pigeons to play pingpong 
during world war ii he rigged up a way for a pigeon to guide a 
missile to its goal by pecking on an image of the target when it 
appeared on a screen the government never adopted the method 
in the 1940s skinner also invented something he thought could 
revolutionize child rearing his air crib known less reverently 
as the baby box 
the crib was a roomy insulated temperaturecontrolled box with 
a window inside the baby could sleep and play comfortably without 
blankets or clothes skinners younger daughter deborah was 
raised in an air crib for 2 years but like the pigeonrun 
missiles it never caught on 
many peoples understanding of skinners vision for society came 
from his novel walden two which was published in 1948 in it 
he described a tightly controlled utopia in which people were 
motivated by positive and negative reinforcements rewards and 
punishment 
during the 1960s and beyond the book attracted a kind of cult 
following hundreds of thousands of copies were sold many to young 
people intrigued by skinners image of a better world 
in the society he drew everyone is happy people dont know the 
meaning of envy and jealousy buildings are communally owned and 
everyone helps out with chores theres time for reading and 
painting song and friendship 
the key to this communitys success is child rearing youngsters 
are raised together discipline is strict and children are taught 
to rein in their desires though selfcontrol exercises 
some critics decried his model society as tyrannical others 
thought that a world populated by such happy and wellbehaved 
people would be bland indeed 
said psychologist carl rogers i can only feel that he was 
choosing these goals for others not himself i would hate to see 
skinner become wellbehaved as that term would be defined for him 
by behavioral scientists and the most awful fate i can imagine for 
him would be to have him constantly happy it is the fact that he 
is very unhappy about many things which makes me prize him 
skinner recorded his work in a series of scholarly books 
including the behavior of organisms verbal behavior and 
science and human behavior he wrote a threevolume 
autobiography and as he turned 80 reflected on aging in enjoy 
old age 
after his retirement in 1974 skinner maintained an office at 
harvard walking the 2 miles each day from his cambridge home he 
also spoke occasionally at scientific societies and in 1982 gave 
the american psychological association a report on how to cope with 
the frailties of age build a stimulating environment create 
memory tricks work less and rest the mind between intellectual 
workouts 
his honors included the national medal of science which he won 
in 1968 and the gold medal of the american psychological 
association in 1971 
skinner is survived by his daughters deborah buzan and julie 
vargas and his wife yvonne

of volunteers police and civil defense officials 
forecasters predicted thunderstorms could bring two more inches 
of rain early monday and the national weather service issued a 
flash flood watch 
leaks appeared in the dam on saturday after six inches of rain 
pushed the lake about two feet above flood stage the lake rose at 
about one inch per hour until cresting at 1 pm sunday fulton 
county conservation officer dick eurit said 
at least 100 people were evacuated from the area immediately 
below the dam officials said 
other residents of the lightly populated area below the dam were 
advised to leave their homes or prepare to evacuate if the dam were 
to break said fulton county chief jailer robert bryant 
twentyeight patients at woodlawn hospital were dismissed taken 
to other hospitals nursing homes or the local high school 
gymnasium shortly after midnight officials said 
volunteers fire crews and civil defense officials laid about 
13000 sand bags along the dam early sunday bryant said 
its holding at this point our main problem is now were 
expecting another 2 to 3 inches of rainfall tonight he said 
sunday afternoon 
the us army corps of engineers brought large pumps to attempt 
to lower the lake the national weather service said 
lake manitou is about 12 feet above mill creek which flows 
along the eastern edge of rochester a town of 5000 in 
northcentral indiana and empties into the tippecanoe river 
a complete failure of the dam could raise mill creek by 6 feet 
the weather service said it would crest in rochester within a half 
hour of a dam failure 
the biggest problem it would affect would be our hospital if 
the dam was to go out a large quantity of water would hit it he 
said

lemonweir river and caused alarm downriver in mauston and new 
lisbon the juneau county sheriffs office said late sunday the 
lemonweir was within a foot of flood stage 
tomah got about 8 inches of rain in three hours late friday

iraqs invasion of kuwait sent the already bearish 
tokyo stock market plummeting and traders said the trend is likely 
to continue 
the dollaryen exchange rate meanwhile settled into a range of 
around 147 to 148 yen to the dollar after major fluctuations early 
in the crisis 
analysts predicted that the strength of the japanese economy 
and the relative weakness of the us economy would keep the 
exchange rate hovering around the same level until the middle east 
stalemate breaks 
tokyos stock traders were already seven months into a bear 
market by aug 2 when iraqi troops overtook kuwait the market 
which had been near the 31000point level immediately plunged 
nearly 600 points 
the next two weeks brought new shocks 
the first was japans decision a few days after the invasion to 
impose unpredented strict sanctions on iraq followed by the united 
nations decision to impose sanctions 
the second was prime minister toshiki kaifus decision the 
following monday to cancel his longplanned tour of five middle 
eastern countries scheduled to begin aug 15 
also during the second full week of august the traditional 
obon holiday beautiful weather and the distraction of the 
national high school baseball tournament combined to weaken 
interest in all markets traders said 
on friday the 225issue nikkei stock average closed at 
2678672 points down 13 percent from its aug 1 close 
traders said the market would continue to slide 
the most likely scenario for the stock market right now is to 
weaken further said pelham smithers an analyst for shearson 
lehman hutton asia ltd citing weakness in the bond market along 
with uncertainty about the iraqkuwait situation as influences 
low yields on the stock market he said have made other 
instruments such as holding cash more attractive 
longterm interest rates on bonds for instance started going 
up in june when japan agreed to spend some 272 billion on public 
works over the next 10 years he said the yield of the benchmark 
10year japanese government bond closed friday at 8050 percent up 
from 7505 percent on aug 1 
the market has been on a longterm downswing since dec 29 when 
the latest postwar superbowl market peaked at 38916 points 
said darrel whitten director of research at the tokyo office of 
prudential bache securities 
superbowl markets when markets typically expanded by about 55 
percent have been followed by corrections averaging 80 to 90 
months he said the question is how long the adjustment will 
last 
another indicator the fiveyear moving average suggests the 
market will bottom out at 2500021000 points he said 
with higher oil prices killing any chance of bringing interest 
rates down and corporate profits unlikely to go up the blowoff 
comes in the market he said 
early in the crisis japans near total dependence on imported 
oil buoyed the dollar 
brent crude for october delivery closed friday at about 2610 
to 2620 a barrel in tokyo compared with 1990 to 2100 a 
barrel in new york on aug 1 
but eventually the markets valued the yen higher because of 
japans economic strength although the dollar normally gains 
strength in times of crisis the structural weaknesses of the us 
economy has overwhelmed its traditional strength in times of 
crisis many traders said 
japan has been working since the first oil shocks of the early 
1970s to broaden its list of suppliers and lessen its dependence on 
oil imports through efficiency and use of other energy sources 
notably nuclear they said 
the yen appears to have settled temporarily into a trading 
range against the us dollar and the deutschemark and the earlier 
pattern of dollar weakness is not expected to reemerge until the 
middle east situation is clarified said analysts at salomon 
brothers asia ltd in a newsletter prepared for the week of aug 
13 
the dollar closed at 14735 yen to the us dollar friday on 
aug 2 the currency jumped 225 yen to 14713 yen closing figures 
bounced between 149 yen and 150 yen but no higher than 15065 yen 
in subsequent days 
with energy prices already high oil and utility company profits 
would cushion the japanese economy while the united states economy 
is struggling under numerous burdens added analyst robert a 
feldman

when spalding sports worldwide wanted 
to entice television journalists into doing stories on its new 
topflite golf ball the company knew sending out a few typed pages 
and a photograph or two wouldnt be enough 
so spalding put out a video joining the growing number of 
companies that are turning to video news releases to promote 
their products 
known as vnrs the 90second spots have become an electronic 
alternative to standard news releases 
spaldings vnr cost just 10000 to make compared to the 
hundreds of thousands of dollars a commercial can cost but ended 
up reaching more than six million viewers according to steven 
shaw president of visual concepts media inc a bloomfield company 
that produced and distributed the video 
first the video was distributed to local television stations 
across the country then spaldings new golf ball made the national 
airwaves when after seeing the video the today show did its 
own story on gameimprovement equipment 
it was an opportunity for us to be associated with a 
tremendous growth in the game of golf without being blatantly 
commercial said j greg sherry a spokesman for spalding based 
in chicopee mass 
publicityhungry corporations have been sending public relations 
film to local stations since the advent of television in the 1940s 
but vnrs only began to enjoy a boom in popularity in the 
mid1980s when the proliferation of satellite dishes made them 
easier to distribute and local news shows needed more material to 
fill longer onehour formats 
most vnrs closely resemble news stories complete with 
interviews and narration the product being hawked is presented 
but only as part of what appears as a larger news story 
the spalding video is presented as a story about how hightech 
sporting equipment can improve the performance of weekend athletes 
professional and weekend golfers were interviewed about what 
they look for in a golf ball greg norman without ever endorsing 
or even mentioning the topflite ball tells the viewer that the 
average golfer should simply find a ball he likes and stick with 
it but after his interview the camera zooms in on one of 
spaldings topflite plus ii balls 
for a cost of between 10000 and 20000 a vnr which 
typically runs about 90 seconds can be beamed to newsrooms around 
the country via satellite 
the use of vnrs remains a controversial topic in the television 
news industry 
many news directors question the objectivity of a 
corporateproduced video and claim to have rigid policies against 
using them 
theyre great for the company but theyre terrible for 
viewers because theyre biased said paul frega news director of 
wvittv in new britain 
deborah johnson assistant news director at wfsbtv in hartford 
added theyre not useful to us because they are no different 
than a press release 
johnson and frega acknowledge that their stations sometimes use 
a small film clip from a vnr for background footage that might be 
difficult to get on their own both news directors cringe however 
when asked if they ever use unedited versions 
we never ever use those said frega i think its kind of 
sad that some stations do 
such hostility comes as something of a surprise to those who 
produce vnrs who say many stations use them despite their 
disclaimers 
its a holierthanthou attitude said douglas brush 
executive vice president of dj brush associates a new york 
consulting firm specializing in corporate communications 
news directors do not like to admit they use prepared 
material brush said but the fact of the matter is there are 
cutbacks in the television news industry and despite what they 
tell you many of them welcome wellprepared video releases 
medialink a new yorkbased public relations firm that is the 
nations largest distributor of video news releases commissioned a 
poll in february to find out whether news stations were using vnrs 
james gold medialinks managing editor said 78 percent of news 
directors and producers who responded to the nielsen poll said they 
used edited material from a video news release an average of once a 
week 
gold whose company distributed 1200 vnrs last year said most 
of the videos provided television stations with story ideas they 
later developed themselves usually only a small portion of the 
video news release ends up being used in the news broadcasts 
if used responsibly theres nothing wrong with them said 
gold 
at visual concepts shaw and partner ric serrenho both former 
staffers for wtnhtv in new haven say they are amazed when local 
stations claim they never use vnrs 
i really take offense to that says serrenho were not 
forcing anybody to take this product it has to be a legitimate 
news story 
industry analysts however say most television news stations 
still view vnrs with skepticism because of their inherent public 
relations slant 
these people are not stupid they know a commercial when they 
see it said james kaminsky editor of corporate video decisions 
a magazine that covers the corporate video industry 
despite the war of words between news directors and video 
producers vnrs are becoming a lucrative cottage industry within 
the corporate video industry 
today vnrs account for anywhere from 60 to 100 million of the 
corporate video industry according to industry estimates 
medialinks survey showed that last year approximately 3500 vnrs 
were produced across the country 
its big and getting bigger kaminsky said

donald trump blames troubles at his 
three casinos on a faltering economy and believes his latest deal 
will give them time to rebound state officials disagree 
the division of gaming enforcement says mismanagement and the 
opening in april of trumps taj mahal casino resort are to blame 
and a report by the gaming division for the state casino control 
commission holds out little hope for a longterm turnaround apart 
from trumps request for approval of a plan to put up his casinos 
as collateral for an emergency 65 million loan 
trump pledged the casinos as security for the loan as part of a 
restructuring of the casinos 1 billion debt the banks agreed in 
june to lend him the 65 million so he could make an overdue 43 
million bond payment on trump castle casino resort by the bay a 
trump attorney says the loan is in escrow awaiting the commissions 
decision 
the gaming division reluctantly recommended the commission 
approve the plan tuesday but it attached 13 reporting conditions 
and it said the deal which is part of trumps scramble to 
handle the 32 billion in debt he has amassed to build his 
fortunes here and in new york is no guarantee of success 
these agreements even if approved and strictly adhered to by 
the parties do not and will not bring to a conclusion the 
financial difficulties facing the trump organization said the 
report released on the first day of commission hearings thursday 
the report said mistakes in loading the casinos and trumps real 
estate and airline holdings with so much debt might force the 
developer to shed assets and concentrate on rallying a few core 
assets 
excessive debt has acted as a powerful agent for change and 
ironically has acted as a brake on management mistakes the 
report said 
according to secondquarter casino reports released wednesday by 
the casino association the taj mahal lost 14 million in its first 
three months ended june 30 trump castle lost 8 million last 
quarter and trump plaza hotel and casino recorded an 863000 
profit 
the division blames the new taj mahal in part for accelerating 
trump castles decline and weakening the previously solid trump 
plaza the taj mahal has hovered around its breakeven point of 
13 million a day during the busy summer months leaving trumps 
remaining casinos and the citys other gaming halls to split the 
remaining business 
trump conceded friday that perhaps the taj mahal had 
cannibalized some of the business directed at his other two 
casinos but he repeated his claim that none of his gaming halls is 
for sale saying the taj mahal merely had the misfortune to open in 
a stagnant gaming market and a recession striking especially hard 
in the northeast 
had the taj mahal opened in a good economy the other casinos 
would not have been hurt trump said atlantic city business is 
down when you have something opening in a bad economy youre 
looking at a whole different ball game 
ed tracy president of trumps casinos and noncasino hotel 
here said the taj mahal has taken some business away from the 
citys other gaming halls but that he expected the situation to 
turn around within six months
