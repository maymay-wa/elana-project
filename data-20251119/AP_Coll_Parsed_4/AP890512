a woman described as the high priestess of a 
murderous drug cult swore friday that a former head of interpol in 
mexico who killed two women and himself last year belonged to the 
sect members of the sect have been blamed for 15 ritual slayings 
the woman 24yearold sara aldrete villarreal protested her 
own innocence and denied she urged a gang member to kill their 
leader as police closed in 
at one point she started to cry and said i want to see my 
father 
ms aldrete a former honor student in a texas college 
testified at her arraignment hearing that florentino ventura was a 
member of the sect 
ventura a veteran police officer who had been the interpol 
chief in mexico since early 1985 killed his wife and another woman 
and then shot himself during an argument on sept 17 1988 
authorities called it a case of double murder and suicide they 
said ventura 60 and his wife maria cira villanueva 39 got into 
an argument after dining with another couple and ventura shot his 
wife and olga trevino arizmendi 39 before killing himself they 
based their report on the testimony f mrs trevinos husband elias 
orozco salazar who witnessed the killings 
interpol is the parisbased international police organization 
that coordinates the police activities of participating nations 
against international criminals its full name is international 
criminal police organization 
ms aldrete was charged with murder criminal association and 
resisting arrest 
the charges were filed in connection with the saturday shootout 
in mexico city in which she and four other cult members were 
arrested and the ringleader adolfo de jesus constanzo 26 and a 
companion were shot to death in a closet 
i never gave orders to kill adolfo ms aldrete said at her 
hearing before judge bernardo tirado gutierrez of the 58th federal 
district court 
no charges have been filed in connection with 15 macabre 
slayings on a ranch outside matamoros a mexican border town near 
brownsville texas or the cults purported drugsmuggling 
activities 
authorities say the cult believed that through human sacrifices 
it could gain occult protection for its drug running officials 
said members cut off body parts and boiled organs as part of the 
rituals 
prosectors say ms aldrete constanzo and three other cult 
members made a pact to kill each other rather than face arrest 
when constanzo saw police on the street below he panicked and 
demanded to be killed they say 
they said ms aldrete encouraged fellow cultist alvaro de leon 
valdez to turn his machine gun on constanzo a cubanborn american 
from florida and constanzos righthand man martin quintana 
the death pact and her alleged encouragement are the basis of 
the murder charge 
ms aldrete denied ordering de leon valdez to shoot constanzo 
and quintana 
everyone was yelling she said i was extremely 
nervous what i yelled to alvaro de leon was that they stop 
shooting that they the police were going to kill all of us 
speaking from behind a barred enclosure facing the courtroom 
ms aldrete repeated earlier statements to authorities that she was 
not involved in the ritual slayings or the drug smuggling 
the way i found out about the deaths and everything that 
happened at the ranch was when the bodies were shown on 
television she said 
but she said she suspected constanzo was involved in drug 
trafficking because of all the money that he carried 
ms aldrete said she tried to escape when the group fled to 
mexico city after the 15 bodies were unearthed 
authorities on both sides of the border had been searching for 
constanzo ms aldrete and other cult members since the first body 
was dug up on april 11 
most of the victims bodies were mutilated including that of 
mark kilroy a premed student from santa fe texas 
ms aldrete said friday she tried to attract police attention to 
the hideout of the fugitive cult members by tossing a note out the 
window of the fourthfloor apartment the note said a woman was 
being held hostage in the apartment 
after the charges and her earlier statements to authorities were 
read to her ms aldrete was allowed to speak briefly with a lawyer 
for the first time since her arrest 
the attorney horacio moyar quintanilla of monterrey said he 
was hired by ms aldretes father 
something that is not there in my previous testimony is that 
also florentino ventura was a godson of adolfo according to what 
adolfo told me ms aldrete told the court she did not elaborate 
also arraigned friday were de leon valdez and omar francisco 
orea the lengthy prosecution statement against them also said 
ventura had been initiated into the sect 
two other people maria del rocio cuevas guerra and dr maria de 
lourdes guero were charged with covering up a crime in connection 
with the killings on the santa elena ranch outside matamoros their 
case was to be transferred to a federal court 
francisco orea was charged with homicide firing a weapon at 
authorities resisting arrest criminal association and causing 
injuries de leon valdez was charged with the first four crimes 
orea and two other men also were charged in the july 1988 
killing of a transvestite ms aldrete was charged with covering up 
that case

when political times were bad and his photograph 
album meant certain persecution li dachen buried it in the park 
near his house now he displays with pride the pictures of his 
days as a chinese student in leningrad 
this one is an old woman who lived near my dormitory he 
said cradling a torn photograph of a woman in a flowered apron 
she often cooked me lunch on the weekend but she is dead now i 
learned that from a letter a few years back 
li 65 is one of the thousands of chinese who studied in the 
soviet union during the 1950s before the two countries split in 
1960 over ideological and personal matters between their leaders 
the rift sent many chinese back home and left thousands more 
with friends and colleagues across the border wondering whether 
they would see them again 
in recent years however the two socialist giants have begun to 
heal that rift mikhail s gorbachev will come to china on monday 
in the first visit by a soviet leader to china in 30 years 
xing shugang one of chinas experts on the soviet union laughs 
when he thinks of his recent research 
it was like a great big joke the 59yearold professor said 
in an interview here i am a wellknown scholar and i had to talk 
to americans and japanese and australians about the soviet union 
finally i can go back 
xing who was president of the chinese students association in 
moscow from 1956 to 1959 met his first russian in 1947 when he 
went to harbin in northeastern china to learn the language 
we were the young cadres of the communist party i was 18 and 
ready to work for the motherland china and the soviet union were 
close allies then and we needed help in our war against chiang 
kaishek 
at the time harbin was home to hundreds of russians who had 
fled their homeland following the bolshevik revolution 
most of them didnt really hate the soviet government some 
were just afraid we were very close with them they were not just 
our teachers but our friends 
when the group returned to the soviet union in 1955 xing said 
he felt a great loss other soviets soon replaced them 
this was a different breed they were the experts he said 
referring to the thousands of soviet engineers scientists and 
businessmen who came to china in the 1950s to help develop the new 
communist country 
many were chauvinists always ordering the chinese about 
telling us what to do we chinese are proud people and dont take 
kindly to that kind of treatment 
when xing went to the soviet union in 1956 he looked up his old 
teachers from harbin 
i found olga kalenin a wonderful teacher in a small town 
outside moscow but it was very sad the soviet government had not 
been good to her they didnt treat her like one of their own her 
son had been forced to drive a truck others were washing dishes 
life as a student also had its unpleasant surprises 
we were closely watched by the kgb they were always trying to 
get information from us he said its an indication of the 
problems in both our governments that this fear was and is almost 
unshakeable 
even now xing said he sees great impediments between the two 
peoples 
both of our countries are changing rapidly but were not at 
the point where we can travel freely with no worries thats a 
question of human rights i hope that changes 
in his apartment with his photo album spread out on his bed li 
sighs and turns a page 
one way or the other this summit wont change my life the 
soviet union was my past now i have nothing to do with it 
a retired naval officer li studied engineering in leningrad in 
the 1950s during the ultraleftist cultural revolution of 196676 
he was suspected of being involved in a great spy ring of soviet 
agents 
it was then that i buried the book he said many of my 
old classmates burned theirs but i kept mine those were good 
years 
li said he remembers the first day he went to the hermitage in 
leningrad 
it was in late april it was a clear day and i was with my 
russian friends we spent the day looking at the beautiful 
paintings and listening to them recite pushkin then we drank 
vodka 
the album with its tattered cover is a sad book for li 
the friends and teachers i tried to keep in touch with have 
all died or left the country he said its been so long

east jerusalem where 140000 arabs live on 
land annexed into israels capital is emerging as a major 
stumbling block to prime minister yitzhak shamirs peace plan 
israel calls jerusalem its eternal capital and shudders at 
the hint of giving up the eastern sector captured from jordan in 
the 1967 middle east war it includes the western wall judaisms 
holiest shrine 
jerusalem the city of jerusalem all of the city of 
jerusalem is part of the state of israel shamir declared on a 
recent walking tour of the jewish quarter in the walled old city 
but the plo also has declared jerusalem as the capital of its 
wouldbe state and many palestinians say the arab sector must be 
part of any agreement to end the bloody uprising against israeli 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
the west bank is the body and jerusalem is the soul arab 
poet fauzi bakri said in an interview one without the other is 
empty nothing 
the seemingly irreconcilable demands have cast a shadow over 
shamirs call for elections to choose representatives in the 
occupied territories to negotiate an interim peace plan with israel 
shamir and members of his rightwing likud bloc want to exclude 
the arabs of east jerusalem from voting 
but the us state department and the leftleaning labor party 
which shares power in shamirs coalition government are pressing 
for some arrangement to let those residents vote 
the question is further complicated because several influential 
palestinians likely candidates in any election live in east 
jerusalem 
more than 80 palestinian leaders from jerusalem and the 
territories have rejected shamirs plan as has the plo they say 
it does not recognize their demand for independence 
conflict over jerusalem is nothing new canaanites jews 
greeks romans christian crusaders and arabs have been among its 
conquerors 
jerusalem was to have been an international city under the 
neverimplemented un partition plan to create jewish and arab 
states in palestine the 1948 arabisraeli war left east jerusalem 
in arab hands and the western sector in israel 
after east jerusalems capture in 1967 israel sought to annex 
it it met with strikes and boycotts like those of the current 
uprising and only a few hundred arabs accepted israeli citizenship 
bakri noted that most arabs have boycotted city elections 
believing that voting would acknowledge israels sovereignty 
israeli democracy for the arabs is like plastic flowers he 
said there is form and color but no scent 
amir cheshin an israeli who advises mayor teddy kollek on arab 
affairs says israel has tried to accommodate the arabs in the 22 
years since the barricades splitting the city were torn down 
there are job opportunities travel opportunities freedom of 
the press and religion and all the benefits of israeli law he 
said 
he noted that under jordanian rule jews were not allowed to 
live in the old city and were denied access to the western wall 
the last remant of the ancient jewish temple 
today christians moslems and jews can worship freely 
cheshin said 
but israel has forced arabs out of the jewish quarter recently 
it has limited access to the al aqsa mosque one of islams holiest 
sites because of the violence of the 17month uprising 
ibrahim dakkak an engineer who heads an arab development group 
charges that israel has used the past two decades to try to 
judaize east jerusalem 
they have put rigid limits on arab construction he said 
but they have surrounded east jerusalem with jewish colonies to 
try to keep it forever separate from the west bank 
the seven housing developments that israel has built house about 
110000 jews around east jerusalems arab neighborhoods 
the population of jerusalem has grown from 267800 in 1967 to 
more than 482000 today municipal statistics show that four out of 
every five arabs living in jerusalem were born in the city while 
only two in five jewish residents were 
because the city is disputed territory most western governments 
keep their embassies in tel aviv some like the united states 
have built two consulates in jerusalem one in the east and 
another in the west 
the eastern sector remains largely arab in character 
men go to cafes to drink thick arabic coffee and linger over 
water pipes women in anklelength dresses and white scarves sell 
vegetables at street corners and boys push carts piled high with 
arab bread through crowded markets 
in a paean to jerusalem titled candles on the town wall 
bakri hails the citys arab traditionalists 
you are the prophets 
of poverty and steadfastness 
in the old town 
you are the homeland

over tangiabrishin afghanistan ap tangiabrishin means 
ridge of silk and straddles the ancient trade route but helicopter 
crews flying convoy cover call it the wall of death 
nearly every day senior capt humayun his copilot and 
engineer have flown shotgun for trucks carrying food and weapons 
from kabul to jalalabad the eastern provincial capital under siege 
by moslem insurgents since march 7 
this is our job we do it for our homeland said the 
24yearold pilot who has been a member for six years of the 377th 
hero regiment based at the airport in kabul capital of afghanistan 
on wednesday he flew 13 western journalists the 75 miles to 
jalalabad in an mi8 chopper over the ridge bristling with 
guerrilla rockets escorted by five hind helicopter gunships it 
was the first trip to the city by western reporters since the siege 
began 
humayun says guerrillas shoot down one in four helicopters 
flying over the wall of death 
humayun lifted off from kabul airport crossed the mountains 
that surround the capital then settled his machine to an altitude 
of about 30 feet skimming at 160 mph over barren hills and valleys 
dotted with bombed mudandbrick houses and the burned wreckage of 
military vehicles 
the sarobi oasis where sporadic fighting has been reported 
flashed past below and the chopper climbed for tangiabrishin 
which loomed ahead within minutes 
over a deep gorge the crew began dropping decoy flares designed 
to deflect any heatseeking missiles insurgents might fire 
a wedge of three hind gunships led the passenger helicopter 
launching their own rockets occasionally breaking formation to fly 
laterally into gullies and pelt the ground with cannon and rocket 
fire 
with two gunships trailing humayun raced the mi8 through the 
canyons at 130 mph diving and weaving around hills and 
outcroppings using the terrain as natural cover 
ill fire the rockets if i suspet something is out there but 
that wont necessarily mean were under attack he said 
then he fired three rockets backfires jolted the helicopter and 
humayuns nervous passengers dived to the floor 
in 10 minutes the six aircraft were past the ridge of silk 
having bested the wall of death at least for now and humayun 
said the danger is over 
he guided the helicopter across the rocky plains and landed in a 
rice paddy on the outskirts of jalalabad a centuriesold way 
station between east and west near the khyber pass 
four hours later he returned to take the visiting journalists 
back to kabul this time with six attack choppers flying escort 
tangiabrishin was less than 20 miles away and this time the 
guerrilas fired two rockets 
humayun put the mi8 down in a shallow stream and two escorts 
hovered above while the other four circled nearby hills with guns 
blazing 
the young pilot jumped out of the helicopter when he returned 
moments later his passengers demanded to know why 
i was thirsty he said humayun grinned and returned to the 
cockpit 
with the way cleared he headed his aircraft for the ridge 
again he dropped flares fired rockets and dodged through the 
canyons then the seven choppers cleared tangiabrishin and 
clattered past sarobi 
humayun opened the cockpit door and pointed at the buildings in 
the distance 
kabul he said with a thumbsup 
the rebels control much of the countryside but they have yet to 
capture a major city capturing a city would give them a base for 
the interim government formed in pakistan in february and offer an 
alternative to the sovietbacked government in kabul 
president najib has said the 11yearold war will continue until 
all sides agree to sit down at the negotiating table he has called 
for direct talks with the united states which supports the 
guerrillas but washington has rejected the idea 
on thursday foreign minister abdul wakil said the failure of 
the jalalabad offensive proved a negotiated peace settlement was 
the only solution 
he said us policy would fail if the united states continues to 
support the rebels 
if america wants to give them more time to demonstrate their 
military power then all they will be doing is giving them more 
rockets he said theyve had time to show their power they 
have no power they only fire rockets

reyes syndrome a potentially fatal disease 
associated with aspirin in childhood flu and chicken pox cases has 
reached the lowest reported level since its discovery just 20 
us cases last year officials said thursday 
at its peak in 1980 reyes syndrome struck 555 people the 
disease struck 101 americans in 1986 the year in which aspirin 
containers were first required to carry warnings about it 
since then reyes syndrome reporting dropped to 36 cases in 
1987 and 20 in 1988 the us centers for disease control reported 
reyes syndrome first observed in the 1950s causes symptoms 
including severe vomiting and lethargy and can result in coma and 
even death it usually occurs in children and is usually preceded 
by a bout with a viral illness such as influenza or chicken pox 
researchers have documented a link between the use of aspirin by 
young patients during chicken pox or flu and the subsequent 
development of reyes syndrome 
the decline in the number of rs cases since late 1980 
coincides with the increased publicity about this association 
the atlantabased cdc said 
that is the reason concluded dr larry schonberger a cdc 
researcher study after study shows aspirin is the primary cause 
of reyes syndrome cdcs been pushing this since 1980 
the 1988 count is the lowest since national surveillance of 
reyes cases began in 1976 the cdc said 
nine of the 20 reported reyes syndrome patients in 1988 had 
suffered respiratory illness such as flu before the onset of 
reyes four had chicken pox the previous year 18 of the 36 
patients had respiratory illnesses and seven had chicken pox 
in 1988 as in 1987 most cases occurred in january february or 
march the peak months for flu or chicken pox cases

the department of veterans affairs is taking 
another look at the cases of all vietnam veterans whose benefits 
claims due to exposure to agent orange were denied and easing the 
standards for receiving compensation 
the change became known thursday when va secretary edward 
derwinski said the government will not appeal a federal judges 
decision earlier this week that struck down regulations restricting 
compensation for victims of agent orange 
derwinskis decision was seen as a major step toward disability 
benefits for some of the more than 34000 veterans of the vietnam 
war who have unsuccessfully sought to have the government admit 
their exposure to the toxic herbicide has caused health problems 
derwinski said the va will follow the judges instructions to 
review all previously denied claims and use new statistical 
standards to decide whether specific diseases are presumed to have 
been caused by agent orange exposure 
its a very significant step said mary stout president of 
the vietnam veterans of america a 35000member group that filed 
suit over the vas denial of benefits in agent orange cases i 
think it does show that theres a new veterans administration and a 
new administration thats taking a different view of the agent 
orange situation 
agent orange was widely sprayed by us forces in vietnam as a 
defoliant its medical effects years and decades later on the 
soldiers who handled it or were exposed to it have been the subject 
of intense legal and scientific debate 
us district judge thelton henderson ruled this week in san 
francisco the va had used an impermissibly demanding test in 
requiring proof of a causeandeffect relationship between exposure 
to agent orange and specific diseases 
instead he said the agency should require only a finding of a 
statistically significant correlation or increased risk of 
incidence a less difficult standard to meet 
derwinski a veteran and former member of congress said he had 
begun a good hard look at the departments agent orange policy 
even before the federal judges ruling he said he concluded it was 
not good policy and frankly not good politics to fight the 
ruling 
va officials said the department will direct its 11member 
scientific committee that reviews agent orange issues to take a new 
look at all scientific and medical studies of agent orange using 
the new statistical standard 
derwinski said he expected final decisions on the diseases by 
october 
deputy secretary anthony principi said the va would consider any 
veteran who served in vietnam to have been exposed to agent orange 
and would not require specific proof they were in an area where the 
herbicide was sprayed 
the department which until this year was known as the veterans 
administration has consistently held that only one disease a skin 
condition known as chloracne was caused by exposure to agent 
orange during military service 
as a result the va has denied disability compensation for 
veterans who claimed exposure to other diseases including cancer 
the va has provided medical treatment for those conditions however 
whether those cancers and other illnesses can be linked 
statistically to agent orange exposure has been a matter of 
dispute derwinskis decision puts that question before the vas 
panel of scientists and other experts which had concluded there 
was no scientific link based on the previous standard 
derwinski and other va officials said they had no way to 
estimate the potential cost to the government in added benefits to 
veterans if the panel agrees to a statistical assumption that 
additional diseases were caused by agent orange exposure 
the cost is irrelevant derwinski said 
rep gv sonny montgomery dmiss chairman of the house 
veterans affairs committee said derwinskis decision was in line 
with congressional wishes that compensation be decided on the 
basis of sound scientific and medical evidence 
the judge has said that the department has written the 
regulations too narrowly and the department has agreed to go back 
and rewrite them montgomery said i think the secretary has 
made the right decision 
of the claims related to agent orange already filed nearly 
7000 involve three main categories of illness nonhodgkins 
lymphoma softtissue sarcoma and a liver ailment known as pct 
for which some contend links to agent orange have been established

this was not their fathers 
oldsmobile 
but a swarm of bees still sought to call a cutlass supreme 
parked outside a local pub home frightening customers and leaving 
a tavern waitress in a sticky situation 
dana birmingham a waitress at the verona lounge wasnt 
flattered when the swarm of about 20000 bees picked her car to 
settle down on tuesday 
people kept coming in and saying theres a swarm of bees out 
back said birmingham 29 then they started to come in the 
front because they were afraid to go through the bees i kept 
trying to figure out what was on the back of my car that attracted 
them 
when bees reproduce in the spring colonies sometimes split in 
two with half the swarm left hiveless said michigan state 
university entomology professor roger hoopingarner they normally 
settle on a tree or bush while scouts look for a new hive location 
its a fairly common phenomenon but not on oldsmobiles 
hoopingarner said 
i was scared to drive home said birmingham who enlisted 
the aid of beekeeper paul parsons he baited a hive and lured away 
most of the homeless bees 
then i went to the car wash birmingham said

the nations winter wheat harvest may be the 
smallest since 1978 because of lingering drought and severe freeze 
damage in some major producing areas 
as a result the thriving us export trade may slacken and some 
additional upward pressure will be put on consumer food prices 
says the agriculture department one bright spot for the lucky 
farmers wheat market prices probably will rise further 
the usda said thursday in its major crop estimate of the new 
season that winter wheat production may be about 143 billion 
bushels down 8 percent from last years 156 billion bushels 
despite a boost in planted acreage 
officials said the average yield based on indications as of may 
1 was estimated at 349 bushels per harvested acre compared with 
last years 392 bushels per acre 
farmers are expected to have about 41 million acres for harvest 
this year up 3 percent from 398 million in 1988 said the 
departments agricultural statistics board but there has been 
widespread abandonment by growers 
initially plantings totaled 547 million acres meaning that 
only 75 percent of the acreage planted is good enough to harvest 
this year the report said that is the lowest since 1951 
reggie wyckoff president of the national association of wheat 
growers said drought in the central great plains and freeze damage 
in the pacific northwest have ravaged crops 
as a result farmers in these areas deserve to receive federal 
assistance similar to that offered last year when drought 
devastated the northern plains and the corn belt he said 
last year congress approved a 39 billion emergency aid package 
to help relieve some of the drought damage many have urged usda to 
extend the major benefits to 1989 wheat producers who have had 
similar losses but the administration says it is up to congress 
the new estimates provide solid evidence of this seasons 
losses and conditions will probably get worse rather than 
better wyckoff said in a statement issued here 
conditions point to lower yields than last season in the 
central and southern plains the southeast and along the pacific 
coast states the report said 
the kansas wheat crop was estimated at 2024 million bushels 
less than twothirds of the states 1988 production of 323 million 
bushels washingtons harvest showed a comparable decline with 
output estimated at 689 million bushels against 1085 million last 
year 
despite the sharp losses in the winter wheat areas usda 
economist ralph parlett said the effect will be mild on grocery 
shoppers 
its going to be small but it will have an effect he said 
in a telephone interview 
parlett said a 1 loaf of bread has about seven cents worth of 
wheat in it theoretically he said if the cost of wheat doubled 
the loaf would still cost only 107 but he emphasized again that 
was a theoretical example 
winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the following 
summer it makes up about threefourths of total us wheat 
production the remainder is planted in the spring 
no 1989 production estimates for spring wheat corn and other 
major springplanted crops were included those will be issued by 
usda later in the growing season 
however in a related supplyanddemand report usda projected 
based on assumptions of normal weather and trend yields that 
total wheat production in the united states this year could be 
about 205 billion bushels up from last years 181 billion 
bushels 
the report showed wheat prices could rise to a range of 380 to 
420 per bushel on the average in 198990 from 374 estimated 
for the current marketing year that will end on may 31 
at the higher prices wheat exports would drop significantly to 
115 billion bushels from 146 billion bushels currently the 
report showed the us wheat stockpile on june 1 1990 would be 
drawn down to around 500 million bushels from 594 million bushels 
estimated this june 1 
the report also projected the 1989 corn crop at 785 billion 
bushels up from the droughtriddled harvest of 492 billion last 
year soybeans were indicated at 195 billion bushels up from 154 
billion in 1988 
but the projections were described as highly tentative and 
subject to change as the season progresses 
another usda report meanwhile showed that the soviet union is 
headed for another bumper grain harvest 
department analysts said soviet grain output could be 210 
million metric tons up 8 percent from last years production 
the good outlook stems from a relatively good growing season 
to date but moscows push for greater output of livestock 
products for soviet consumers will mean record grain use and 
continued large grain imports to cover shortfalls the report 
said 
a metric ton is 2205 pounds equal to 367 bushels of wheat or 
394 bushels of corn 
by comparison the tentative projections put total us grain 
production in 1989 at 2944 million tons up from 2039 million 
tons in 1988 
the soviet forecast included 915 million tons of wheat 1055 
million tons of coarse grains such as corn and barley and 13 
million tons of miscellaneous grains and pulses 
last year when production was 1951 million tons the harvest 
included about 844 million tons of wheat 975 million tons of 
coarse grains and more than 131 million tons of miscellaneous 
crops 
if realized the forecast of 210 million tons would mean that 
soviet grain production has exceeded 200 million tons in three of 
the last four years an unprecedented production record by that 
country the alltime high grain output was 2374 million tons in 
1978

a los angeles production company wants to 
produce a madefortv movie about pan am flight 103 which exploded 
over scotland before christmas and killed 270 people victims 
relatives said 
fredda weiss a producer for rainy day productions presented a 
proposal april 29 to the victims of pan am flight 103 a group 
formed by victims relatives after the bombing 
two other companies have inquired about making a similar film 
but the firms have made no proposals relatives said 
on dec 21 1988 a bomb destroyed the pan am jet carrying 259 
people near lockerbie scotland the victims included 35 syracuse 
university students studying abroad eleven people in lockerbie 
were killed 
the idea of a movie drew mixed reactions from relatives of those 
killed in the plane crash 
eleanor hudson the mother of 16yearold victim melina hudson 
said some liked it while others thought it was too soon to do a 
movie on the incident 
if the relatives received any money it would go to lobbying 
efforts to persuade the government to investigate the handling of 
the bombing and to push for improved airport security said mrs 
hudson of albany 
initially i had mixed feelings said aphrodite tsairis of 
franklin nj whose daughter alexia 20 was killed to think 
about this bombing depicted on tv is less than comforting 
but so much information already is out that someone will do a 
movie with or without the relatives cooperation tsairis said by 
working with the production company the relatives hope to have 
some control over the final product she said 
as proposed the film would be a drama focusing on what happened 
after the bombing and would tell the story of the families weiss 
said it would not concentrate on the actual bombing and crash she 
said 
it might stir people to call for an investigation said 
eileen monetti of cherry hill nj who lost her 20yearold son 
richard in the tragedy if that happened then it would 
definitely be positive

a hospital and some homes were evacuated 
thursday night after three midsouth railroad engines and 12 cars 
derailed and leaked chemicals into the chunky river about 10 miles 
west of meridian officials said 
no injuries were reported in the derailment which occurred 
about 830 pm 
we have directed a precautionary evacuation in a onemile 
radius around the derailment site said jim maher director of 
the mississippi emergency management agency 
it wasnt immediately known how many patients were being 
evacuated from the private pine forest hospital and sanitarium 
said agency spokesman sandy megrolis 
the patients were being taken to matty hersee hospital in 
meridian a state charity hospital which has many open beds as 
state officials are preparing to close it and two other hospitals 
by june 30 
by 1130 pm officials said they still didnt know how many 
families lived in the evacuation area emergency management agency 
spokesman dusty perkins said as few as a dozen people may live 
within the evacuation area 
at the point of the derailment the railroad parallels the 
chunky river and they went off on the river side of the rail line 
theyre either in the water or right on it close to it maher 
said of the cars 
perkins said officials main concern was one car of caustic 
soda which had dumped almost all of its 20000 gallons into the 
river he said caustic soda can kill fish and would burn on direct 
contact with the skin 
our concern now is a pollution concern rather than a public 
safety concern nobody is going to breathe any toxic fumes from 
this and die but we dont know what will happen to the river he 
said 
investigators had yet to determine the cause of the derailment 
besides the caustic soda car perkins said three engines were 
spilling diesel fuel into the river and three of six derailed cars 
carrying ethylene glycol alcohol had small leaks 
he said four derailed cars carried vinyl chloride but they 
werent leaking he said the vinyl chloride could create toxic 
fumes if it caught on fire 
he said the remaining derailed car carried plastic beads of 
styrene b which would only be hazardous if it burned

george bush wont have to worry about one 
thing following his response to his first major international test 
as president few will accuse him of overreacting 
for days the administration had raised expectations of a tough 
response to the defiant attitude of panamanian leader manuel 
antonio noriega 
no option is being ruled out white house and state 
department spokesmen said after noriega according to scores of 
international observers tried to rig sundays national elections 
and then decided to throw out the results some in congress were 
publicly advocating the removal of noriega by military force 
after bushs brief statement thursday listing the steps he 
intended to take a reporter asked an administration official how 
such modest measures would induce noriega to seek another line of 
work 
we hope he will see the error of his ways the official said 
but after carefully calculating potential costs and benefits 
bush apparently felt that a pugnacious response to the tumult in 
panama could be counterproductive 
perhaps recalling john f kennedys darkest hour early in his 
presidency bush may have decided he was not about to risk a bay of 
pigstype disaster in panama 
uprooting noriega with military force presumably would be a 
cinch for the pentagon but the diplomatic costs for the united 
states would linger for years given the latin american aversion to 
evidence of american heavyhandedness 
the latin americans would have been equally unforgiving if bush 
had decided to respond by scrapping the panama canal treaties 
imposing a trade embargo against panama would cause even further 
damage to the countrys already weak economy but the costs for the 
large american business community would be high too high bush 
apparently felt 
at the start of his remarks bush stressed the need to send a 
clear signal in support of democratic values in latin america but 
the one significant action he took dispatching more than 2000 
combat troops to panama had less to do with democracy than with 
protecting american lives 
that was the way bush portrayed the troop movement but he 
wouldnt object if noriega gave it a less benign interpretation it 
wouldnt be the first time that a strong country tried to achieve 
its political goals by projecting its military power without 
actually using it 
bush is now hoping that international public opinion will 
encourage noriega to do what the philippines ferdinand marcos did 
three years ago surrender power to someone who supposedly has a 
legitimate claim to it namely guillermo endara the opposition 
candidate last sunday 
some european countries have already weighed in against noriega 
but the latin americans thus far have been disappointingly slow to 
respond according to state department officials 
at an organization of american states meeting wednesday only 
venezuela peru and el salvador joined the united states in 
denouncing noriega delegates from 27 other countries remained 
silent 
mexicos view is that elections are an internal matter and 
should not be on the oas agenda but oas foreign ministers 
nonetheless are expected to convene here next tuesday at 
venezuelas request to discuss the panama question 
secretary of state james a baker iii has spoken often of the 
need for the united states to act in concert with latin american 
countries on issues of common interest that policy will be put to 
its first significant test at the oas meeting 
in his first brush with a crisis situation bush clearly showed 
he is no bomb thrower rhetorically the administration could not 
have been tougher on noriega during the week preceding the election 
and in the immediate aftermath 
all of noriegas perceived efforts to impose his will on the 
panamanian people were trumpeted from government podiums around 
washington noriega was portrayed as willie horton in khaki in the 
end though noriega was treated kinder and gentler than michael 
dukakis well almost

president bush is winning broad support from 
congress for placing a much tighter noose around the neck of 
panamas manuel antonio noriega without an excessive show of 
military force 
but many lawmakers say bush will encounter intense pressure for 
direct military action to topple noriega from power and return 
panama to democracy if the situation there worsens if us 
civilians are attacked or if the security of the panama canal is 
threatened 
democratic leaders of the senate and house joined their 
republican counterparts in endorsing as measured reasoned 
careful and deliberate the bush plan to protect the 50000 
american civilians in panama and to send an additional 2000 combat 
troops there 
they also endorsed his decisions to open a diplomatic offensive 
in latin america and elsewhere to repudiate noriegas efforts to 
undermine last sundays presidential election and to condemn the 
subsequent violent attack on panamanian opposition leaders 
but several lawmakers questioned whether bush has carefully 
considered how the united states will respond if international and 
domestic pressure fails to achieve noriegas downfall 
sen alan cranston dcalif the senates deputy democratic 
leader said bush has so far rejected pressure to either invade 
panama or scrap the treaties that commit the united states to turn 
over control of the panama canal at the end of the century 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas and other key 
lawmakers acknowledged that many members of congress believe the 
president did not go far enough and should take tougher action to 
drive noriega from power 
sen richard lugar rind said the people of panama who by 
most accounts defeated noriegas handpicked presidential candidate 
by a 3to1 margin may be able to settle matters on their own 
but lugar also declared that the united states has the right to 
to keep all further military options open for response to 
potential crises 
were drawing a much tighter noose around noriegas neck with 
every one of these unified actions lugar said 
the bipartisan leadership of congress issued a joint statement 
expressing support for the republican president a step that was 
unheard of in the rancorous and bitter partisan debates that marked 
major foreign policy actions in the reagan administration 
the statement was signed by house speaker jim wright dtexas 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine house majority 
leader tom foley dwash house minority leader robert h michel 
rill and dole 
at a news conference mitchell said he had told the president 
there will be those who think this does not go far enough 
sen christopher dodd dconn chairman of the senate foreign 
relations subcommittee on latin america said he commended bush for 
his restrained action despite a probable tremendous degree of 
pressure on the president to take actions that were more strident 
defense secretary dick cheney emerging thursday afternoon from 
a briefing for house and senate members said he found wide support 
for the presidents very careful very measured response 
many members of congress said they agreed with that 
but sen brock adams dwash sounding a cautionary note 
voiced the hope the president would consult with congress under the 
terms of the war powers act if there were any chance that us 
troops might be involved in combat in panama 
i want to be certain that we act all together so we dont have 
a split between members of congress and the administration as we 
take action adams said the situation is fraught with peril 
and we want to have more than just briefings we want them to use 
the law

a new antipollution bill would extend 
alreadyexpired deadlines for cities to meet clean air requirements 
but force many areas to install tougher pollution controls 
hearings on the bill were quickly scheduled for may 2324 by 
chief sponsor rep henry waxman dcalif chairman of the house 
energy and environment health subcommittee the panel with initial 
jurisdiction over clean air legislation 
the legislation is certain to be controversial because it would 
require tough new controls on auto emissions the powerful chairman 
of the house energy and commerce committee rep john d dingell 
dmich has opposed such controls in the past 
almost every us city is in violation of the current clean air 
acts dec 31 1988 deadline for meeting air pollution standards 
the noncompliance could bring those areas economic penalties such 
as moratoriums on new industrial facilities or a cutoff of federal 
highway money 
the new measure sponsored by more than 100 lawmakers would end 
the economic threat except for areas that act in bad faith in 
combatting air pollution 
instead the legislation would extend the deadlines but require 
the most severely polluted localities to install tougher pollution 
controls 
local areas would be classified as having either moderate 
serious severe or extreme air pollution moderate areas would 
receive four years to attain federal standards serious areas would 
get eight years severe areas 12 years and extreme areas 16 years 
each area would have to install special measures based on the 
category the higher the category the more measures to be 
required controls would range from tighter control of new 
pollution sources to requirements for greater use of alternative 
fuels 
the legislation would require stricter standards for tailpipe 
emissions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides the two key 
components of ozone pollution controls also would be tightened for 
carbon monoxide including a special standard for coldweather 
conditions 
new requirements also would be installed for reduction of 
hydrocarbon pollution from the evaporation of gasoline while cars 
are running parked or refueling

they decided to stay 
weve never had any trouble at all the panamanians have been 
wonderful to us said kirberg whos been posted here since 1987

the bottom of the box 
i like panama the boy declared while the kirbergs were not 
the only americans on the move thursday many were staying put 
an army family that lives near albrook air force base said they 
were being permitted to remain off base because they were already 
so close 
an american who works for a commercial importing firm in panama 
city said he had considered taking up bushs offer to shelter any 
american but i dont want to live on an army base 
both families asked that their names not be used 
leblanc said he had three spare bedrooms because his daughters 
are in college he was planning to put a family in each 
his wife had run out to rent some videotapes to entertain their 
guests which also included three children 
its going to be great to hear the patter of little feet 
again leblanc said 
i dont know said kirberg dubiously looking at leblancs 
neat living room blakes got enough toys with him to trash this 
joint 
both blake and kirberg said they thought it was better to be 
safe than sorry and they felt safer behind the tall chainlink 
fence that surrounds fort clayton 
but they were upset to leave their home 
i wish things were better so we could stay ms boyle said 
you never feel comfortable in somebody elses home

north americans are less likely than 
europeans to fear dying when a panic attack strikes but more likely 
to think they may be going crazy a new study suggests 
north americans also appear more likely to avoid situations in 
which previous attacks occurred a condition that can make a person 
housebound said researcher heinz katschnig of the university of 
vienna in austria 
the differences may reflect cultural influences on how people 
perceive symptoms or different kinds of panic disorder katschnig 
said 
panic attacks afflict some 12 million americans who suddenly 
suffer overwhelming terror for no apparent reason 
katschnig and colleague michaela amering studied 1168 panic 
attack patients from 14 countries they presented the work thursday 
at the annual meeting of the american psychiatric association 
the different responses also may result from cultural 
differences in how people describe panic attacks katschnig said 
or they may reflect differences in how patients in the study were 
signed up in different countries the patients had been recruited 
for a drug trial 
the study included 220 panic attack sufferers in the united 
states and canada 367 in southern europe belgium france italy 
and spain 324 in northern europe austria denmark west germany 
sweden and the united kingdom and 257 in latin american brazil 
colombia and mexico 
dizziness feeling faint and palpitations were the most common 
symptoms reported by about 90 percent of patients in each of the 
four geographic areas 
choking or smothering was reported most often in the latin 
american group followed by southern europe northern europe and 
north america 
fear of dying followed the same ranking suggesting it is a 
reaction to the sense of choking or smothering katschnig said 
fortyfour percent of north american patients said they feared 
death during the attacks compared to 57 percent of patients from 
northern europe 70 percent from southern europe and 72 percent 
from latin america 
fear of going crazy and a sense of unreality were each more 
common in the americas than in europe suggesting the fear was a 
reaction to the feeling of unreality katschnig said 
seventythree percent of north american patients and 64 percent 
of latin american patients reported fear of going crazy during 
an attack just under half of the two european groups reported it 
while 91 percent of the north american patients reported 
avoiding situations they associated with previous attacks only 65 
percent of south american patients did seventynine percent of 
northern europeans reported avoiding such situations and 72 percent 
of southern europeans did 
staying home to avoid those situations may be more common in 
cultures where most of ones needs can be met at home through such 
means as ordering out for meals katschig said 
the austrian researchers collaborated with german and american 
scientists on the study 
armand loranger a psychologist at cornell university medical 
college cautioned that studies comparing countries must rule out 
noncultural explanations before ascribing differences to culture 
for example he said the study sample may be skewed by 
differences in how often panic attack victims end up at psychiatric 
facilities

officials of the bush and carter 
administration say the furor over last weekends elections in 
panama may bode well for prospects that nicaraguas sandinista 
government will conduct fair balloting next year 
i am prepared to accept the nicaraguan governments intention 
today to carry out an honestly counted election francis macneil 
who was president carters ambassador to costa rica told the 
commission on free and fair elections in nicaragua 
certainly they have before them the example of gen noriega 
who has demonstrated how not to steal elections macneil said 
thursday in the final round of three days of hearings by the 
privately financed conservativebacked bipartisan commission 
his testimony came as president bush urged allied nations to 
join in condemning gen manuel antonio noriega panamas military 
leader for election fraud in sundays balloting in which noriega 
has claimed victory 
on wednesday peter rodman special assistant to the president 
for national security affairs told the commission i think the 
sandinistas may well have been watching what happened in panama 
he added the sandinistas are smarter than noriega 
but keith e schuette president of the national republican 
institute for international affairs said his group found 
disturbing parallels too frequent to be considered accidental 
in the election laws government organization and opposition in 
nicaragua and panama 
sufficient freedom of organization expression and activity 
does not currently exist to ensure a free and fair election in 
nicaragua schuette said thursday 
luigi einaudi director of policy planning for the state 
departments bureau of interamerican affairs and 
ambassadordesignate to the organization of american states agreed 
the nature of the nicaraguan government raises major questions 
about the ability to in fact carry out a free and impartial 
election 
however einaudi said these need not be insurmountable 
obstacles he expressed cautious optimism that the game is not 
automatically over and that it may in fact be possible to move the 
political conflict in nicaragua to the political ground and away 
from the military 
the nicaraguan elections are to be held in february 1990 under 
an agreement managua made with the governments of costa rica el 
salvador guatemala and honduras

even though his murder conviction was 
questioned in the movie the thin blue line and the verdict 
against him eventually thrown out randall dale adams does not feel 
vindicated 
but since he is unlikely to get a new trial adams said 
thursday he hopes to spread his story widely hoping it will help 
keep others from getting railroaded 
adams and filmmaker errol morris answered questions from about 
300 people following a special screening of the film here thursday 
since adams release march 22 morris said he had received many 
letters from prisoners proclaiming their innocence adams lawyer 
randy schaffer of houston also has been deluged with requests for 
help 
morris said he was flattered his work had led to the release of 
adams convicted in 1977 for the slaying of dallas policeman robert 
wood but was a little overwhelmed 
i have been getting a lot of letters from lawyers and 
prisoners but im a filmmaker not an investigative journalist 
morris said 
even distant family members are calling saying theyre in 
trouble morris said no more miscarriage of justice films 
for me 
adams 40 spent more than 12 years in a texas prison and once 
faced execution for the 1976 slaying in 1980 his death sentence 
was commuted to life in prison 
in morris documentary david ray harris an inmate now on death 
row for another murder recanted his testimony against adams and 
all but confessed to the killing 
the texas court of criminals appeals set aside adams conviction 
march 1 ruling the prosecution suppressed evidence and used 
perjured testimony the dallas county district attorneys office 
dropped the charge march 24 saying evidence was insufficient for a 
new trial 
i would have preferred to have a jury in dallas release me 
adams said in an interview im not fully satisfied 
adams was set free march 22 and has hit the talk show and 
lecture circuit since returning to columbus where he lives with 
his mother on the citys west side 
its been very therapeutic for him going around the country to 
talk about his case said schaffer the attorney the reaction 
he has gotten has probably done more for him than any psychiatrist 
could have done 
adams was asked whether he felt bitter about the time he spent 
in prison 
i dont like the fact that the years were taken from me 
adams said but im happy they didnt execute me 10 years ago 
monday would have been the 10year anniversary of my execution 
date 
adams was asked if he thought harris would ever be tried for 
woods slaying 
the only way they could try harris is if they got randall 
adams to testify and i dont think theyre big enough to do that 
he said 
tickets to the film showing were 10 each with proceeds going 
toward the randall dale adams benefit fund the fund was 
established to help adams pay legal expenses

the widely publicized vindication of former death 
row inmate randall dale adams has created public mistrust of texas 
prosecutors and is forcing them to think about fair play local 
attorneys say 
the texas court of criminal appeals threw out adams capital 
murder conviction march 1 and he walked from prison march 22 after 
an appeals process that stemmed from a documentary film saying 
adams had been unfairly convicted 
since then a prosecutor involved in the case has been fired 
two others have resigned a former dallas detective has been 
investigated and cleared on perjury allegations and the state 
bar of texas has begun a review of claims that a former prosecutor 
suppressed evidence in adams 1977 trial 
in april 17 potential jurors had to be stricken from a dallas 
murder case panel after saying they distrusted prosecutors 
one said he could not believe anything presented by assistant 
district attorney winfield scott who led a lastminute rally to 
keep adams behind bars 
scott since has been fired 
i think its too early to tell whether anything positive will 
come out of this said adams attorney randy schaffer of 
houston they terminated winfield scott thats a start 
this case might have brought home what happens when you dont 
play fair in a real dramatic way said leslie mcfarlane who 
represented the state when adams was arguing for a new trial then 
resigned shortly after the case was dropped 
it might have cost the district attorney a credibility price 
in the short term but i dont think so in the long term he 
said 
ms mcfarlane said she believes it was right to drop the charge 
adams 40 was convicted for the 1976 shooting death of dallas 
policeman robert wood and came within three days of execution 
before his sentence was commuted to life 
public awareness of the case was revived last year by the errol 
morris documentary the thin blue line which questioned the 
truthfulness of witnesses including david ray harris the star 
prosecution witness against adams 
harris has since virtually confessed to the slaying he is on 
death row for an unrelated killing 
the appeals court in overturning adams conviction ruled that 
then prosecutor doug mulder had suppressed evidence and several 
witnesses lied under oath during adams trial the state bar 
association is reviewing mulders actions in the case 
ms mcfarlane and colleague john c creuzot who also worked on 
the case submitted their resignations april 5 the same day dallas 
county district attorney john vance fired scott one of the 
original adams prosecutors 
scott and vance did not return repeated calls from the 
associated press over a twoweek period mulder now a private 
defense attorney also did not return calls 
a dallas county grand jury this month declined to indict a 
former dallas police detective gus rose who allegedly had 
perjured himself in a december appellate hearing on the case 
mark obbie editor of texas lawyer said several attorneys have 
called the weekly magazine asking about the case 
theres a certain amount of defensiveness obbie said 
theyre afraid of what new yorkers and californians will say 
about texas and they attorneys wish that the system were 
better 
schaffer said adams case could occur anywhere 
prosecutors still get promoted and see their careers made by 
whether they win the case or not schaffer said in the glare 
of the publicity and the tv cameras the pressure will always be on 
prosecutors to cut corners to make their cases as quickly as 
possible

withdrawals from the nations thrift 
institutions remain near record levels and prospects for 
substantial improvement remain dim economists say 
the federal home loan bank board said thursday that depositors 
withdrew a net 85 billion in march compared with 92 billion in 
february and a record 108 billion in january 
it was the 11th month in a row in which thrifts lost ground and 
the fifth of withdrawals in excess of 7 billion 
i dont know that the withdrawals can continue at these levels 
for the rest of the year without threatening the solvency of major 
institutions almost by definition it has to get better but it 
wont get all that much better said economist paul getman of the 
wefa group a bala cynwyd pa forecasting firm 
net withdrawals for the first three months of 1989 totaled 285 
billion more than triple the 84 billion outflow for all of last 
year from october 1987 through april 1988 money had moved into 
sampls as stock market investors sought the safety of federally 
insured accounts 
getman said he sees little prospect of improvement in the two 
main factors driving the withdrawals shaky public confidence in 
sampls and rising interest rates at competitors such as mutual funds 
interest rates after a temporary lull will begin rising again 
later this year he predicted and he said he doubted confidence 
will improve because president bushs proposed sampl bailout will 
increase the rate of thrift takeovers and closings 
thrifts are going to be in the news in a negative sense as far 
as the eye can see he said thats not to say the bush plan is 
not a good thing it is but depositors dont make fine 
distinctions 
however james barth the bank boards chief economist said 
apart from a few isolated instances there is no evidence that 
the outflows reflect a loss of depositor confidence 
economist martin regalia of the national council of savings 
institutions a trade group agreed that rising interest rates are 
driving the bulk of withdrawals 
with the housing market weak and shortterm and longterm 
interest rates nearly identical sampls see little need to attract 
more deposits he said 
im not alarmed by the outflow number if it got to the 
point where institutions that wanted to keep deposits couldnt 
then it would be more serious right now we have not heard anything 
to that effect regalia said 
but getman said large institutions in california where the 
housing market is booming are suffering because of difficulties in 
attracting funds

implementing the brilliant pebbles 
spacebased defense plan could reduce the 691 billion pricetag 
attached to the early development stage of star wars research says 
a pentagon official 
lt gen george l monahan jr director of the strategic 
defense initiative told members of the senate appropriations 
defense subcommittee thursday that brilliant pebbles could trim the 
cost of phase i of star wars he did not provide specifics 
the united states has invested about 17 billion in sdi 
commonly known as star wars and members of the senate panel 
expressed reservations about the direction and the high price of he 
research program 
the members of congress and their constituents must ask 
themselves whether the nation can afford sdi and whether the return 
on the investment is justified said sen daniel inouye 
dhawaii chairman of the subcommittee 
inouye called current spending on star wars robust and said 
the 17 billion could have been funded in other weapons 
sen tom harkin diowa criticized the research program as 
illdefined with conflicting goals 
ronald reagan told us sdi is to protect people it looks like 
were going to protect missiles harkin said 
but monahan sought to assure the lawmakers as he described the 
brilliant pebbles process and the pentagons current plans 
monahan said the defense science board and the jasons a group 
of university professors mostly physicists will review the 
concept for the department this summer 
this fall subsequent to brilliant pebbles study efforts 
we will reexamine our spacebased architecture with a view toward 
the degree of incorporation of this concept monahan said 
under the system 3000 to 5000 satellites about three feet 
long and weighing less than 100 pounds each would be placed in 
orbit about 400 miles above the earth 
brilliant pebbles is supported by outgoing sdi chief lt gen 
james abrahamson who predicted in a feb 9 memorandum that it 
could be deployed in space for about 25 billion far less than the 
estimates of 45 billion for other sdi orbital systems 
monahan said recent budget cuts have forced the pentagon to 
delay work on some star wars research including a sixmonth slip 
in development of a tracking satellite and a twoyear delay in a 
demonstration experiment 
defense secretary dick cheney has proposed cutting the fiscal 
1990 budget for star wars from the 59 billion called for by 
former president reagan to 46 billion 
overall fiveyear spending on star wars would be cut from 41 
billion to 33 billion 
in an appearance last month before the house armed services 
committee cheney said money for star wars will buy us the 
capability to look aggressively at brilliant pebbles 
if brilliant pebbles does not work out the ultimate 
deployment date of the current spacebased missile program would 
slip by two years cheney said he did not set a date

the us dollar today hit an eightmonth high 
against the japanese yen while the key index on the tokyo stock 
exchange fell 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues an 8914point 
gainer thursday shed 21516 points or 063 percent to finish at 
3386633 points 
the dollar ended trading at 13580 yen up 125 yen from 
thursdays close of 13455 yen opening higher at 13540 yen the 
currency remained above that level throughout the days trading and 
at one point hit 13583 yen 
it was the dollars highest closing rate against the yen since 
the currency closed at 13560 yen on sept 6 
traders said the dollars surge followed overnight gains against 
most major currencies including the japanese yen on overseas 
markets 
the dollars rise was triggered by a decision thursday by 
president bush to send us troops to panama to help protect 
americans in that country said a trader at the bank of tokyo 
there are 10000 troops already based at us installations in 
panama 
the us currency is regarded as a safe haven in times of 
international tension 
in a news confernce this morning finance minister tatsuo 
maruyama said he was not alarmed by the dollars surge the 
dollar was bought due partly to its potential strength at the 
time of an emergency such as confusion over the panamanian 
situation maruyama said 
on the tokyo stock exchange share prices declined on a broad 
front due to concerns over the yens fall and the possibility of a 
discount rate hike 
some japanese economists have said the nations monetary 
authorities are waiting to assess price data due later this month 
before deciding on the timing for cutting the discount rate which 
now stands at a postworld war ii low of 25 percent

federal rule changes aimed at speeding up 
licensing of nuclear power plants are inadequate and wont revive 
the stagnant industry an official of a leading nuclear utility 
told congress 
richard b priory a senior vice president of duke power co 
said his companys analysis of the rule change which takes effect 
next thursday does not alter its view that nuclear power is not 
now a viable option in this country 
priory told a house energy and commerce subcommittee thursday 
that while the rule change adopted by the nuclear regulatory 
commission was a step in the right direction it did not go far 
enough in freeing utilities from legal entanglements 
the rule does not provide the necessary assurances that a 
utility having invested more than a billion dollars in a nuclear 
power plant will be able to operate that plant in a timely manner 
or indeed to operate it at all he said 
priorys main objection was that the nrc rule did not eliminate 
the possibility of someone raising a legal challenge to a completed 
nuclear plant after it had received its operating license but 
before it could begin running 
he said congress should amend the 1954 atomic energy act to 
limit the possibility of such 11thhour challenges which in recent 
years have stopped plants from opening 
duke power which provides power in north and south carolina and 
relies on nuclear plants for twothirds of its electricity is 
widely considered one of the most successful nuclear utilities 
the main aim of the nrcs rule change was to ensure that 
questions about the suitability of a nuclear reactor design as 
well as the plants location are answered before construction 
begins 
lando w zech jr the nrc chairman told the subcommittee the 
new rule was a huge positive step toward reviving the nuclear 
industry he said the nrc had received no orders for new plants 
since 1978 but that many new generating plants would be needed to 
meet energy demands in the 1990s 
the commission is confident that the final rule as presently 
structured provides a sound basis for the efficient construction 
and licensing of new safe nuclear power plants zech said 
dean r tousley speaking for the union of concerned scientists 
told the panel that while his group favored speeding up the 
licensing process the nrc revisions go too far by limiting the 
kinds of issues that can be raised after a plant is completed he 
said the rule meant only design and site issues could be raised 
where the commission runs adrift is in thinking that it can 
resolve all constructionrelated issues prior to construction and 
deny a hearing on those issues at the end of construction 
tousley said

the defense budget submitted to congress last 
month will leave the navy short of f14 jetfighters according to a 
congressman from the state where the aircraft are made 
the navy will have 110 fewer f14 fighter planes than it needs 
by 1996 rep george hochbrueckner dny said thursday in 
releasing an analysis prepared for him by the congressional 
research service of the library of congress 
no matter how you slice the bushcheney budget it comes up 
dangerously short in navy aircraft the conventional weapons 
america needs and uses in real life hochbrueckner said 
the fivepage report described in its introduction as a 
quick rough analysis concludes that the navy will have 417 f14 
tomcats at the end of fiscal 1996 110 fewer than it has said it 
will need that equates to a 209 percent shortfall 
the study assumes that there will be an increased demand for 
f14s as two aircraft carriers are converted from midway airwings 
which carry no f14s to roosevelt airwings which carry 20 each 
the analysis also projects a loss of 70 f14s during the period due 
to peacetime accidents 
the report is the latest weapon in a battle being waged by long 
islands five congressmen to save the plane manufactured by the 
grumman corp of bethpage ny 
the f14 was a casualty of the pareddown budget submitted last 
month by defense secretary dick cheney cheney saved 360 million 
in fiscal 1990 by canceling orders for 12 new f14s 
cheney said the f14s are too expensive at a time when the 
pentagon has been ordered to cut 10 billion from its 1990 budget 
according to published reports and navy calculations the new 
planes cost 75 million each

the white house has quickly reversed itself on 
a major environmental problem and embraced the idea of a formal 
treatynegotiating process on global warming 
the decision puts the united states in line with all other major 
western economies in supporting such an initiative 
and the reversal occurs the same week a government scientist 
testified the white house made him alter his testimony on the 
greenhouse effect to give the impression not everyone agreed on 
the severity of the problem 
the change of course was revealed in a cable dispatched thursday 
night to us delegates at an environmental conference in geneva 
sponsored by the united nations 
declaring it was essential for the united states to exercise a 
leadership role the cable said we should seek to develop full 
international consensus on necessary steps to prepare for a formal 
treatynegotiating process 
it proposed that us delegates seek agreement for a global 
warming workshop hosted this fall by the united states 
the cable a copy of which was obtained by the associated press 
was signed by white house chief of staff john sununu who only last 
week earlier had rejected efforts to put the united states in the 
lead in establishing an international convention on global warming 
the convention idea had been supported by secretary of state 
james a baker iii and environmental protection agency 
administrator william k reilly 
however sununu had argued that a convention was premature and 
that more analysis was needed of economic and other effects of the 
potentially dramatic actions needed against global warming 
officials said 
scientists believe that global temperatures could rise by 4 
degrees or as much as 9 degrees fahrenheit by the middle of the 
next century because increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other 
manmade gases in the atmosphere will trap and retain heat from the 
sun in a process similar to what happens in a greenhouse 
such a warming trend could melt polar ice caps and cause sea 
levels to rise cause severe droughts and storms and severely 
disrupt the earths biological systems 
scientists at a senate hearing on monday testified that the 
problem might be worse than their own computer programs can predict 
the white house had ordered one of the scientists james e 
hansen director of national aeronautics and space administrations 
goddard institute for space studies to change his testimony to 
avoid the impression that there is unanimity within the 
government on this issue 
the hearing had put a sharp focus on the fact that the united 
states was out of step with its allies on global warming 
in his cable sununu said we consider the reported emerging 
agreement on an advanced preparatory program to address global 
climate response issues comprehensively to be extremely positive 
to further this process please make every effort to obtain 
agreement on a global warming workshop this fall hosted by the 
united states sununu said 
he said such a meeting should be designed to identify the 
scientific legal technical and economic issues critical to 
further progress on beginning negotiations on an international 
convention on global climate change 
while seeking consensus on steps for a treatynegotiating 
process sununu cautioned that because the size of the problem is 
so large improper or illadvised actions could have enormous 
unintended environmental economic and social consequences 
moreover he said that the interests of developing nations must 
be taken into account 
sununu said the proposed workshop should be structured to help 
identify the elements that should be included in a framework 
convention on global climate as well as identifying key domestic 
and economic policies of all countries that must be included in any 
comprehensive process

congressional budget writers say they expect 
the house and senate to give final approval next week to a 117 
trillion spending plan for 1990 that claims a big deficit bite but 
leaves most federal priorities unmolested 
housesenate negotiators agreed to the plan which claims a 
997 billion deficit reduction by a unanimous voice vote 
thursday after only two short days of public meetings the few 
disagreements the two chambers had were worked out behind closed 
doors 
i dont expect any problems senate budget committee 
chairman jim sasser dtenn said when asked about the prospects 
for approval on the floor of congress 
democratic and republican leaders have been working together 
since the bush administration and congressional leaders forged a 
deal last month that settled most questions about spending levels 
and how to achieve savings on may 4 bipartisan majorities in the 
house and senate approved their own spending plans which differed 
little from each other 
in reaching their compromise the house agreed to the senates 
higher spending totals for energy and commerce programs while the 
two chambers compromised on education health law enforcement and 
community development initiatives 
one of the last disputes was resolved when the senate agreed to 
drop a provision that would have guaranteed 11 billion for public 
housing subsidies the decision will instead be left to congress 
appropriations committees which normally make most spending 
choices 
middle ground was also found in the 28 billion the package 
claims in deficit reduction for next year the senate agreed to 
reduce the 27 billion in savings it sought from the medicare 
program to 23 billion an amount expected to come from lowered 
payments to doctors and hospitals 
the makeup of 53 billion in additional tax receipts still must 
be determined a choice that is expected to be difficult president 
bush says 48 billion of it can come from cutting the capital 
gains tax but democrats say the plan is a handout to the wealthy 
and a moneyloser 
other fights are expected to be waged over a controversial 
proposal to raise 250 million by having the government sell 
broadcast rights and 400 million by licensing the production of 
chloroflourocarbons the chemicals blamed for depleting the earths 
ozone layer 
battles will also be raised over about 35 billion worth of 
undetermined savings expected to come from agriculture 
transportation community development health and other programs 
in addition out of 163 billion worth of savings that will 
require changes in the law the budget assigns only about half to 
specified congressional committees for action the budget simply 
assumes that the rest of the savings will occur an assumption that 
sen pete domenici of new mexico ranking republican on the senate 
budget committee said causes a very serious credibility 
problem 
the spending plan allows 2992 billion in defense spending 
42 billion less than the amount needed to keep up with inflation 
another 17 billion would be spent on foreign aid both totals were 
set in last months budget pact between bush and congress 
the budget has been savaged by critics who say it relies too 
heavily on unrealistic economic assumptions that make the deficit 
seem smaller and accounting gimmicks that create little real saving 
the lawmakers claim 850 million in savings by moving some 
payments for farmers from 1990 to this year and 200 million in 
savings because of the offbudget plan the bush administration 
prefers for rescuing the nations ailing savings and loan 
institutions 
the claimed 997 billion shortfall allows congress to claim to 
have met the 100 billion deficit target set by the grammrudman 
law for the fiscal year beginning oct 1

here is a transcript of president bushs 
announcement on panama and his news conference thursday 
the people of latin america and the caribbean have sacrificed 
fought and died to establish democracy 
today elected constitional government is the clear choice of 
the vast majority of the people of the americas and the days of the 
dictator are over 
still in many parts of our hemisphere the enemies of democracy 
lie in wait to overturn elected governments through force or to 
steal elections through fraud 
all nations in the democratic community have a responsibility to 
make it clear through our actions and our words that efforts to 
overturn constitutional regimes or steal elections are unacceptable 
if we fail to send a clear signal when democracy is imperiled 
the enemies of constitutional government will become more dangerous 
and thats why events in panama place an enormous responsibility 
on all nations in the democratic community 
this past week the people of panama in record numbers voted to 
elect a new democratic leadership of their country 
and they voted to replace the dictatorship of gen manuel 
noriega 
the whole world was watching 
every credible observer the catholic church latin and european 
observers leaders of our congress and two former presidents of the 
united states tell the same story the opposition won 
it was not even a close election 
the opposition won by a margin of nearly three to one 
the noriega regime first tried to steal this election through 
massive fraud and intimidation and now has nullified the election 
and resorted to violence and bloodshed 
in recenty days a host of latin american leaders have condemned 
this election fraud 
theyve called on general noriega to heed the will of the people 
of panama 
we support and second those demands 
the united states will not recognize nor accommodate with a 
regime that holds power through force and violence at the expense 
of the panamanian peoples right to be free 
ive exchanged these views over the last several days with 
democratic leaders in latin america and in europe 
these consultations will continue 
the crisis in panama is a conflict between noriega and the 
people of panama 
the united states stands with the panamanian people 
we share their hope that the panamanian defense forces will 
stand with them and fulfill their constitutional obligation to 
defend democracy 
a professional panamanian defense force can have an important 
role to play in panamas democratic future 
the united states is committed to democracy in panama 
we respect the sovereignty of panama and of course we have 
great affection for the panamanian people 
we are also committed to protect the lives of our citizens

and were committed to the integrity of the panama canal 
treaties which guarantee safe passage for all nations through the 
canal 
the panama canal treaties are a proud symbol of respect and 
partnership between the people of the united states and the people 
of panama 
in support of these objectives and after consulting this morning 
with bipartisan leadership of the congress im taking the 
following steps 
first the united states strongly supports and will cooperate 
with initiatives taken by governments in this hemisphere to address 
this crisis through regional diplomacy and action in the 
organization of american states and through other means 
second our ambassador in panama arthur davis has been 
recalled and our our embassy staff will be reduced to essential 
personnel only 
third us government employees and their dependents living 
outside of us military bases or panama canal commission housing 
areas will be relocated out of panama or to secure us housing 
areas within panama this action will begin immediately it will be 
completed as quickly and in an orderly a manner as possible 
fourth the state department through its travel advisory will 
encourage us business representatives resident in panama to 
arrange for the extended absences of their dependents wherever 
possible 
fifth economic sanctions will continue in force 
sixth the united states will carry out its obligations and will 
assert and enforce its treaty rights in panama under the panama 
canal treaties 
and finally were sending a brigadesize force to panama to 
augment our military forces already assigned there 
if required i do not rule out further steps in the future 
the united states and all democratic nations in this hemisphere 
hope that peaceful resolution can be found to the crisis in panama 
and we urge all those in panama every individual every 
institution to put the wellbeing of their country first and seek 
an honorable solution to this crisis 
the way is still open 
thank you god bless 
q mr president 
a helen 
q are you willing to drop the drug charges against noriega if 
it will mean that he will leave the country or at least give up 
control in a quid pro quo 
a no 
q mr president do you recognize mr endara as the 
presidentelect and what steps should the united states take to 
help them get inaugurated 
a we have not made any formal recognition determination at this 
point 
q mr president we understand that youve been trying to 
a we have been talking to our other countries in the hemisphere 
on that point i might add terry but we have made no further no 
official determination 
q we understand youve been trying today sir to get other 
leaders in the hemisphere to agree on a joint statement of 
condemnation of noriega and i wondered if you can give us a 
progress report on that diplomatic effort 
a well one i have not by joint statement encouraged a joint 
statement in which the united states would participate 
some of the leaders in this hemisphere are working on getting a 
joint statement 
and indeed im told authoritatively that there might be a 
joint statement out of some european countries 
but we would encourage countries in this hemisphere to either 
jointly or personally make strong statements 
and i believe that i want to say 10 countries have already made 
individual statements 
and now i think the next collective diplomatic action is going 
to be at the oas

q mr president sir how many troops will that be and will 
they be quartered in the military compounds will they stay there 
quietly and just be there or will they be out on the streets 
patroling 
a we will assert our treaty rights enforce our treaty rights 
and i will refer i will let general scowcroft answer the 
question 
but my estimate of the troops would be about 2000 
yes 
q mr president why what is your justification for sending 
the brigade of troops what are you worried about 
a im worried about the lives of american citizens and i will 
do what is necessary to protect the lives of american citizens 
and we will not be intimidated by the bullying tactics brutal 
though they may be of the dictator noriega 
q mr president your statement just now about defense forces 
would that be a signal that the united states would look favorably 
on a coup attempt 
a ive asserted what my interest is at this point it is 
democracy in panama it is protection of the life of americans in 
panama 
im going to take two more and then im going to go 
right here and here on the aisle 
q sir weve been calling around these latin american 
embassies we find no enthusiasm for the dispatch of american 
troops there and the mexican embassy even said that they warned 
against intervention are you disappointed with the reaction youre 
getting from the latin americans 
a weve had good reactions from the latin americans 
i havent talked to them on that particular point but we have 
had very good reactions from them 
and ive been impressed with what the role of several of the 
latin american leaders i think for the first time there is a 
total understanding on their part of the threat to democracy from 
the stealing of this election or the threat to democracy in the 
hemisphere from totalitarianism 
and its brought home by this theft of the election 
so they dont and i might add on the troops i have a 
profound obligation and that is as commander in chief of the 
armed forces and as president and that is to protect american life 
and im going to do what is prudent and necessary to do this 
and so we have a different obligation 
we also have certain treaty rights and obligations 
im prepared to fulfill our treaty obligations and i am prepared 
to see that our treaty rights are exercised 
and id leave it right there in terms of the troop deployments 
last one 
q mr president in the reagan administration there was a very 
formal negotiating process with general noriega over terms under 
which he might leave is there any possibility that that might 
repeat itself now that there might be some sort of formal 
discussions between yourselves and the panamanian government and 
general noriega about conditions under which he might leave 
a oh he knows my position on the fact that if he does leave 
we would have the instant restoration of normal relations with 
panama that has been conveyed to him very very recently 
but look i will be openminded about seeing what it might take 
to see him leave 
im not going to go back and do what helen asked about in 
dropping these indictments 
im not going to do that 
it has that has profound implications for our fight against 
narcotics which is has got to be worldwide 
but if theres something short of that the doors open to 
understand what it is that would be required 
but i dont think hes the panamanian people should be asked 
to compromise in terms of their election which was won 
threetoone by those opposed to noriega 
so thered be certain things other nonnegotiable things but i 
dont think that thats between noriega and the panamanian people 
thank you all very much and brent will take your remaining 
questions 
q how is endara is he in the hospital 
bush he was out and then i think hes back in 
but now i dont know whether hes gotten out later on or not 
q is noriega capable taking hostages sir 
q what about ford 
q have you made contact with him 
q are you concerned about him taking hostages 
bush im concerned about protecting the lives of americans and 
thats exactly why ive taken the actions that i have here today

president carlos andres perez marked 
his first 100 days in office today on an ominous note unions set 
a strike date to protest austerity measures ordered by the 
international monetary fund similar protests last winter sparked 
clashes that left nearly 300 venezuelans dead 
if the first nationwide strike in 31 years of democratic rule 
goes off as scheduled next thursday it would underscore the social 
democratic leaders difficulties in convincing venezuelans that his 
program will lift this oilproducing nation out of its economic 
doldrums 
leaders of the powerful venezuelan workers confederation have 
vowed to bring the country to a standstill with the strike saying 
a massive work stoppage would force perez to twist and rectify 
his controversial plan 
the elimination overnight of a number of subsidies that for 
years kept prices down triggered a wave of violence in caracas and 
the deaths of at least 276 people in late february and early march 
the elimination of subsidies on basic commodities had been 
advocated by the imf 
while the violence caused no reshufflings of the perez 
administration it did expose the radical changes that have 
occurred in venezuela a model of stability in latin america 
since he was first president from 197378 when the country was 
rich with petrodollars 
the bonanza of those years helped perez easily win a second term 
in december elections and he begin his new government with a 
festive ceremony that featured 20 presidents heads of state and a 
special us delegation presided over by vicepresident quayle 
but the enthusiasm soon faded overwhelmed by crushing economic 
realities 
inflation during the first four months of the year was 39 
percent and about 15 percent of the labor force of 58 millions is 
jobless almost double that of last year 
the government too is still far from an agreement with foreign 
banks on measures to help alleviate its foreign debt 
perez meanwhile has launched a campaign to gain funds from 
private institutions and if successful news reports say he would 
increase his nations debt from an already high 33 billion to 50 
billion by 1994 when his term ends 
banks however have been reluctant to grant fresh money to 
venezuela 
it is hard to come to terms easily with somebody who is asking 
a debt reduction with one hand and with the other asking for more 
loans said one foreign banker 
the debt is among the strikes targets but it is not clear yet 
if the unions will ask the government to declare a unilateral 
moratorium which perez has consistently rejected or reiterate 
demands for better terms of repayment 
private business leaders have condemned the strike saying it 
will cause 300 million in production losses something the country 
can illafford

president bushs assault on crime will include 
a further assault on combatstyle semiautomatic weapons and the 
criminals who use them administration sources say 
according to the sources bush will make permanent his ban on 
importation of the semiautomatic weapons that are modeled after 
their fully automatic military assault rifles and machine pistols 
gun control opponents in congress and members of the national 
rifle association have strongly urged against a semiautomatic ban 
because it might be used by gun opponents to push for stiffer 
restrictions on all types of guns 
the gun ban was initially imposed in midmarch while the 
government reviewed the uses of the weapons and is part of an 
anticrime package bush will unveil in a speech monday 
bush has not approved the final package but it is expected to 
include more money for prisons stiffer sentencing requirements for 
criminals who use guns and more money for law enforcement in 
general including additional agents for the bureau of alcohol 
tobacco and firearms said the officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
when bush ordered the initial ban he also asked batf to study 
the suitability of the weapons for sporting purposes 
current law requires that such weapons can only be brought into 
the country if they are to be used for sport the bush 
administration initiated the suspension when public outcry mounted 
against street crimes in which such weapons were used 
the guns were increasingly used in drugrelated shootings and 
after the jan 17 killing of five youngsters at a stockton calif 
by a man who used a semiautomatic 
several administration officials want bush to extend the ban on 
imports to cover domestically manufactured weapons that are very 
similar to the foreign models 
but the presidents plan in its preliminary stages did not 
include such a measure the officials said it was unclear how he 
would deal with the suitabilityforsports question in deciding on 
that aspect 
batf is conducting a survey to determine the sports adaptability 
of the weapons the agency has sent out questionnaires to hundreds 
of organizations state fish and wildlife commissions shooting 
clubs gun owners and dealers to learn whether the semiautomatics 
are being used for hunting purposes 
the agencys report to bush dealing with the uses of such 
weapons as well as recommendations from a political standpoint is 
not expected to be complete before midjune 
however sources said bush will deal with the issue before 
obtaining that review since he will be disclosing other components 
of his crime package 
the review will deal with the sticky problem of determining 
which of the weapons some of which are distinguished only by their 
appearance and trappings but not their firepower are for sporting 
bush is expected to announce his plan monday in a washington 
speech to the national fraternal order of police 
among the provisions he is expected to approve are an increase 
in the mandatory federal sentence for crimes involving use of a 
gun and stiffer penalties for crimes involving assaultstyle 
weapons 
bush promised during his campaign last year to back tougher 
sentencing and also called for doubling of the federal prison 
budget over four years adding 250 million each year 
he also called for conversion of unneeded military bases into 
state and federal prisons and said money captured from drug 
dealers and racketeers should be used to pay for the prisons

richard secord the retired officer who ran 
arms to the nicaraguan contras lied to congress in his testimony 
on the irancontra scandal and covered up more than 1 million in 
personal profits a second indictment against him alleges 
secord enlisted by oliver north in the contra arms supply 
network said the ninecount indictment unsealed thursday shows the 
weakness of the governments original case and is a senseless 
attempt to secure a conviction 
the retired air force major general was originally indicted on 
six criminal charges in march 1988 
the decision to indict again is vindictive and contrary to any 
notion of fair play and professionalism secords lawyers said in 
a statement the threepage statement issued by the washington law 
firm of sharp green amp lankford also asked for financial 
assistance from the public to help pay for secords defense 
independent counsel lawrence walsh has seen his socalled 
conspiracy case eviscerated by court rulings and most recently by 
a jurys verdict said secords lawyers 
north who was indicted with secord in march 1988 was convicted 
last week of three of 12 criminal charges against him conspiracy 
and theft counts against the former white house aide were dropped 
jan 13 due to national security concerns 
the new indictment against secord was returned april 7 by a 
federal grand jury investigating possible perjury by irancontra 
figures it was kept sealed to avoid bringing it out during norths 
trial 
secord was the lead witness in the televised hearings conducted 
in the spring and summer of 1987 by the house and senate 
committees he testified without immunity from prosecution before 
the congressional panels 
the new charges include seven counts of perjury in connection 
with his congressional testimony to congress and one count of 
obstructing congress rancontra committees secord also is accused 
of making false statements to congressional staffers about a 
200000 educational benefit for norths children and a 13800 
security system secord paid for at norths home 
secord faces a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment and 
250000 in fines on each count if convicted 
the false statement charge accuses secord 56 of denying to 
lawyers for the congressional irancontra panels that he was aware 
of any money from the irancontra transactions that went to benefit 
north 
the indictment alleges that secord used former internal revenue 
service lawyer willard zucker who was granted immunity from 
prosecution and testified at norths recent trial to hide large 
sums that he diverted to his personal use 
the money came from more than 47 million that zucker based in 
switzerland moved through swiss bank accounts for secord and 
business partner albert hakim the indictment said the accounts 
were part of an enterprise made up of a clandestine network of 
foreign corporations the indictment said 
secord lied to congress by saying that his only profits from 
arms sales to the contras and iran came from his 6000 monthly 
salary the government alleged 
zucker testified at the north trial that in 1986 286 million 
was funneled through swiss bank accounts used in the irancontra 
affair by secord and hakim one 9000 draft testified zucker was 
partial payment for norths security system north was convicted of 
accepting an illegal gratuity from secord in connection with the 
system 
zucker wasnt permitted to testify in detail at norths trial 
about the 200000 death benefit for norths children because north 
wasnt tried on that matter but prosecutors said zucker would have 
testified that he set aside 200000 and that the money is now in 
an account earning interest 
secord was indicted in march 1988 along with north hakim and 
norths exboss former national security adviser john poindexter 
the heart of that indictment was that the four men conspired to 
illegally divert profits from the iran arms sales to the contras 
other charges against secord in the original indictment are 
theft of government property wire fraud conspiracy to pay illegal 
gratuities the offer of an illegal gratuity and payment of an 
illegal gratuity the gratuities charges involve the security 
system and the death benefit 
in a separate legal matter secord was convicted in the fairfax 
county va general district court of drunken driving the 
prosecution said secords blood alcohol level was 020 twice the 
legal limit when he was arrested feb 26 he was fined 200 and 
ordered to enter an alcohol safety program 
secords lawyer said an appeal was planned

researchers report in a study published today 
that a gene previously linked to breast cancer also can also be 
found in ovarian tumors 
the study published today in the journal science suggests that 
testing for the presence of the gene may provide a way of tailoring 
cancer treatment to the precise needs of a patient 
in a cooperative study by seven laboratories researchers found 
that a specific cancerrelated gene called the her2neu oncogene 
was present in tumors of both the breasts and the ovaries 
an analysis of samples from 668 breast tumors and 120 ovarian 
tumors also showed that the oncogene was actively producing a 
protein within the tumors suggesting that the gene plays an 
important role in the disease process 
dr michael press a university of southern california 
researcher who participated in the study said the finding raises 
the possibility that diagnostic tests to detect the gene in breast 
and ovarian cancers could help doctors determine the precise level 
of treatment required by each patient 
earlier studies showed that the numbers of her2neu oncogenes 
in a breast tumor could predict the outcome of a specific disease 
an amplification or elevated number of the oncogenes lead to a 
quicker relapse and a shorter period of survival of breast cancer 
patients 
finding the oncogene in ovarian cancers said press may give 
clinicians a predictor of the disease progress in these patients 
also 
this gene might be a way of identifying patients who would 
have a less favorable clinical outcome he said if one could 
identify such patients then they could be singled out for more 
aggressive therapy 
this would be particularly important for ovarian cancers press 
said doctors now can gauge the level of treatment for breast cancer 
patients based on whether or not cancer cells are found in nearby 
lymph nodes there currently is no such prognostic indicator for 
ovarian cancer he said 
the exact role that hef2neu plays in development of cancer 
tumors is not understood but press said it clearly is an oncogene 
a genetic molecule with a normal function that is changed or 
activated in some way to become part of the cancer disease process 
why that is and what the gene does is unknown at this point 
said press were assuming that the gene is important because it 
codes for a protein but we dont know what the function of that 
protein is 
press said the researchers looked unsuccessfully for the same 
oncogene in tumors from cancers of the lung adrenal gland and 
colon 
the researchers also did a statistical study to relate 
amplification or the numbers of the oncogene present in a tumor 
with the outcome of the disease 
press said the results show that the greater the amplification 
the poorer the prognosis 
with ovarian cancer patients having only one copy of the 
oncogene in tumor cells the median survival time was 1879 days 
for patients with a two to a fivefold amplification the median 
survival was 959 days those with a greater than fivefold 
amplification had a median survival of only 243 days a similar 
pattern was shown earlier among breast cancer patients 
breast and ovarian cancers account for onethird or about 
162000 of all the cancers diagnosed annually in american women 
these types of cancers account for about 25 percent of all cancer 
deaths in women 
coinvestigators with press in the study were judith udove of 
usc william godolphin of the vancouver general hospital canada

university of chicago medical center steven wong duane keith and

pfc greg rieth admitted 
being nervous as he got ready to leave for panama with about 900 
troops of the armys 7th light infantry division 
sure yeah im scared but ill do what needs to be done 
said rieth a cleveland native who wore camouflage fatigues and 
face paint we need to clean up the streets 
the soldiers were scheduled to begin departing at sunrise today 
theyre part of the 2000 combat troops president bush is sending 
to the central american nation to augment the 10000 troops already 
stationed there 
bush said the deployment is intended to protect the lives of 
americans following bloody postelection attacks on opposition 
leaders by supporters of gen manuel antonio noriega 
the president also ordered all us government employees and 
their dependents living off military bases in panama to be 
relocated onto us bases or to return to the united states 
the 7th division troops waved and smiled to reporters and 
photographers as they left fort ord about 100 miles south of san 
francisco by truck and bus convoy they began arriving at travis 
about 35 miles northeast of san francisco thursday night 
the group includes about 100 cooks medics and other support 
personnel 
a mother and daughter waited for the convoy outside the travis 
gate holding cardboard signs that read good luck and hurry 
home 
linda sexson 43 whose son is a submarine crewman based on the 
east coast said she came because im a mother with a son in the 
service and i just came out to say goodbye and good luck 
having someone in the service makes you think about what 
theyre doing it makes you feel it a little more personally 
said her daughter 19yearold nicole fisher 
the division known as the bayonet division is part of a highly 
mobile outfit that carries most of its equipment on its back and is 
designed for quick deployment anywhere in the world 
other military units being deployed include one battalion of the 
armys 5th infantry division at fort polk la and one company 
from the second marine expeditionary force at camp lejeune nc 
fort ord officials got the deployment orders about 
threequarters of the way through the presidents news conference 
thursday said army spokesman jim davis they were not unexpected 
he said when youre a rapid deployment force you pay attention 
to whats going on 
more than 1100 fort ord soldiers were sent to honduras on march 
17 1988 after the reported movement of nicaraguan troops into 
honduras they returned shortly afterward in april of last year 
26 us army helicopters and 200 aviators and other workers were 
sent to panama to bolster protection of us citizens 
the 7th light contingent being sent today includes one battalion 
of light infantry one battery or company of light field 
artillery and one headquarters brigade said a military spokesman 
fort ord was placed on alert wednesday evening and is capable of 
dispatching soldiers within 18 hours of such an alert officials 
said 
many soldiers had time to notify their families davis said 
and he said a family support group met after the deployment began 
and set up a telephone network to keep relatives informed of 
developments 
the wives become pros and they know to get ready for that 
he said 
still emotions were running high as the troops were moved out 
elizabeth shepherd asked how she felt about her husbands 
departure replied scared because im stuck here with the kids 
and i dont know whats going on

clouds could prove to be a builtin thermostat 
for the earth cooling things down to counter the threatened 
greenhouse warming a group of scientists report 
but while researchers attending a meeting of the american 
geophysical union agreed thursday that such a balancing is 
possible they refused to predict that it will actually take place 
lets be very careful about that we dont know that as the 
climate warms up with the greenhouse effect these clouds are going 
to increase and compensate for itdont jump to any 
conclusions cautioned bruce a albrecht of penn state university 
the threat of rising temperatures has attracted considerable 
attention recently many climatologists worry that increasing 
levels of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere will 
raise the planets average temperature by trapping excess heat from 
the sun that would ordinarily be radiated back into space 
the panel of scientists reporting early results from an 
international cloud research project said they found that some 
clouds add to the greenhouse warming while others reduce it even a 
small change in the amount of cloud cover can have a major impact 
they said 
the apparently helpful clouds are the stratocumulus large decks 
of white clouds that form at relatively low levels in the 
atmosphere and are widely seen especially over the oceans 
the way these clouds work they are highly reflective in the 
short wave but they have very little effect on the longwave 
radiation albrecht explained thus shortwave radiation 
arriving from the sun that would ordinarily warm the surface of the 
planet gets reflected back out into space while longwave 
radiation cooling the earth isnt blocked from leaving 
the clouds effectiveness increases if they contain more water 
or if they consist of smaller droplets the researchers said 
if the climate warms and the amount of liquid water in the 
cloud increases that can lead to more reflecting clouds more 
reflecting clouds means that the total amount of energy available 
to the earths energy system is reduced explained tony slingo of 
the national center for atmospheric research 
that acts as a thermostat bringing the climate back into 
equilibrium he said 
the sensitivity of climate to clouds is so enormous that you 
really need only very modest changes in particle size and you can 
wipe out the carbon dioxide warming now whether those process 
really are operating and they really are wiping out the 
warming remains a question he added 
while he too was cautious about predicting what will happen 
penn states albrecht agreed that the stratocumulus clouds can have 
a major effect on cooling the atmosphere 
the number that we toss around if you increase the amount 
of stratocumulus by 4 percent that would be enough to compensate 
for a doubling of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere he said 
on the other hand cirrus clouds those high wispy ones that are 
hard to see actually add warmth to the earth by trapping heat from 
the sun in much the same way that carbon dioxide and other 
socalled greenhouse gases do explained david starr of the 
national aeronautics and space administration 
these clouds are the most common type covering 25 percent to 40 
percent of the earths surface starr said 
the importance of cirrus clouds to climate is similar to that 
of the greenhouse gases added howard hanson of the university of 
colorado at boulder 
recent cloud studies have convinced researchers that the effects 
of clouds are much more complex than they had previously thought 
hanson said 
cirrus clouds are not well understood and are difficult to 
study starr said although scientists are trying to learn more 
government and scientific attention to the theory of greenhouse 
warming has been widespread some researchers warn that rising 
temperatures could severely disrupt climate and weather change 
crop yields and even cause coastal flooding by melting the polar 
ice caps 
some reports have indicated a slight rise in average 
temperatures over the last century a time when industrialization 
has added large amounts of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere

the dispute over the panama canal 
treaties threatens the special relationship that panama and the 
united states have enjoyed since the central american nations 
birth 
this weeks annullment of panamas presidential elections have 
focused new attention on the treaties that allow the us 
government to operate the canal and nearby military bases but say 
it must turn relinquish control of the canal and pull out its 
troops by the end of the century 
cancellation of those treaties was one measure us legislators 
suggested thursday after president bush announced he would send 
nearly 1900 troops to augment the 10000 servicemen already 
stationed in panama 
the troops are part of an effort to force out gen manuel 
antonio noriega who the us government says rigged the elections 
and was behind attacks by his supporters on the opposition 
presidential and vice presidential candidates 
noreiga the countrys de facto ruler since 1983 has said the 
us government plans to renege on the treaties 
panamas relationship with the united states dates to 1903 the 
year it seceded from neighboring colombia with president theodore 
roosevelts help 
that same year the two countries signed a treaty to construct a 
50mile canal across the narrow isthmus connecting the pacific and 
atlantic oceans 
the canal designed to save ships the long voyage around the 
southern tip of south america was inaugurated in 1914 
in subsequent years the united states built numerous military 
installations along the canal and constructed a huge communications 
network 
that early treaty formed a usadministered canal zone while 
panama retained sovereignity in the area the united states had 
unilateral control over canal operations 
the arrangement continued with minor modifications until 1977 
when president jimmy carter and dictator gen omar torrijos signed 
a new set of treaties that said 
the united states would relinquish canal administration to 
panama and pull out all its military installations in a gradual 
process ending on dec 31 1999 
the united states would retain control of and have primary 
responsibility for protecting and defending the canal until then 
the treaties went into effect in 1979 when the united states 
relinquished a bit of americana known as the canal zone along with 
several military installations 
still the cartertorrijos treaties included a clause allowing 
the united states to station train and transport military forces 
in panama 
many panamanians worry that that clause could allow the united 
states to pack the area with soldiers if it believes its control of 
the canal is at stake 
the cartertorrijos treaties said after the termination of the 
canal treaty only panama will administer the canal and maintain 
military forces defense sites and military installations within 
its national territory 
but the us congress approved the treaties with an amendment 
giving its government the right to act against any aggression or 
threat aimed at the canal or against the peaceful movement of 
ships 
that amendment also said the two countries could make future 
arrangements to allow a us military presence in panama by mutual 
agreement 
noriega says the opposition which claims victory in sundays 
aborted elections planned to give the united states that option

exxon corp has recommended naming an 
environmentalist to its board but one of the nations top wildlife 
advocates emerged from a meeting with the companys chairman saying 
exxon was shirking its duties 
they simply are looking at a shortterm fix national 
wildlife federation president jay d hair told reporters thursday 
after meeting with exxon chairman lawrence g rawl and other 
company officials 
the oil company bowing to pressure from pension funds holding 
about 1 billion in the companys stock announced earlier it would 
establish a special committee on environmental matters that would 
review corporate policies and programs related to worker safety and 
the environment 
in addition exxon said it would consider spending more money on 
environmental research and pollution prevention about 55 billion 
has been spent on that from 1970 to 1988 the company said 
the announcement comes about a week after a meeting between 
exxon management and representatives of new york citys pension 
fund a large shareholder 
new york city comptroller harrison j goldin who recommended 
the changes exxon plans to adopt said he was pleased by exxons 
announcement 
its a rather extraordinary development for a large american 
company he said in a telephone interview were pleased that 
they have accepted our proposals and its clear that these 
could go far in helping prevent a repeat of the alaska disaster 
but ed rothschild a spokesman for the washingtonbased consumer 
group citizen action called the announcement nothing more than a 
public relations window dressing that will do nothing concrete to 
improve the environment 
new york officials had said three city pension funds owning 6 
million shares of exxon stock would vote against company management 
at the may 18 annual shareholders meeting if the company failed to 
act on their recommendations 
californias state employee pension fund the nations biggest 
had indicated that it might back the new york group 
about 35 percent of exxons shares are owned by institutional 
investors the company has some 713000 shareholders 
hair said exxons efforts to clean up the spill resulting from 
the march 24 wreck of the tanker exxon valdez were ineffective and 
the company had no longterm plans for restoring the delicate 
balance of life in prince william sound 
hair said rawl rejected several proposals designed to ensure 
that exxon is going to be there as long as it takes no matter how 
much it costs 
among the federations proposals was a plan for exxon to 
contribute 1 billion annually to an independent trust fund until 
the total extent of the longterm economic and environmental 
impacts to the prince william sound region have been objectively 
determined 
sarah johnson an exxon spokeswoman said the company believed 
that such a trust fund would not be in the best interest of its 
shareholders 
fears that exxon would abandon the region once the visible 
effects of the spill are gone were unwarranted she said

a house panel weighing a report on alleged 
mismanagement and contract abuse in a federal lowincome housing 
renovation program denounced aspects of the housing departments 
probe 
members of the banking and finance subcommittee on housing and 
community development on thursday called department of housing and 
urban development inspector general paul a adams to task for his 
investigative methods which turned up no evidence of criminal 
wrongdoing 
democrats criticized adams for waiting until a day before former 
hud secretary samuel pierce was to leave the department to question 
him 
why would you have waited until jan 19 of this year to 
interview the hud secretary samuel pierce who was going out of 
office the next day asked rep henry gonzalez dtexas the 
subcommittees chairman he noted the inspector generals probe had 
begun almost a year earlier 
this seems to be quite planned charged gonzalez calling 
adams derelict in waiting so long 
adams said the delay in interviewing pierce was just a matter 
of scheduling 
the subcommittee also criticized adams for singling out for 
culpability thomas t demery the former assistant secretary for 
housing who was responsible for administration of the controversial 
renovation program 
current housing secretary jack kemp two weeks ago suspended more 
than 100 million in fiscal 1989 funding for lowincome renovation 
projects saying adams investigation had uncovered a system that 
was undocumented ignored existing standards and regulations and 
was based on the perception and reality of favoritism and abuse of 
nonpublic information 
the inspector general reported that former housing appointees 
and other government officials including former hud 
undersecretary philip abrams former assistant secretary for 
housing philip winn and former sen edward brooke rmass used 
the system to win lucrative consultant contracts with public 
housing authorities and developers 
but the report found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing in the 
investigation which covered activities in the hud section 8 
moderate rehabilitation program from january 1984 through november 
1988 
gonzalez asked why adams made no specific recommendations 
regarding possible violations of law by former hud officials 
adams said his office had consulted with the justice department 
throughout the investigation and found no evidence that criminal 
statutes had been violated 
i find a disturbing indication in the documents that because 
these allocation formulas and the laws that pertain to hud are not 
criminal statutes that the conspiracies that go on here of 
individuals working together in order to go around established 
procedures are treated as if they are not criminal matters said 
rep bruce morrison dconn 
adams said the justice department is reviewing the report 
adams and demery appearing for the second time this week before 
a congressional panel described to the subcommittee their roles in 
the program and the subsequent investigation into its selection and 
allocation process 
demery insisted as he had earlier he shared with other hud 
officials concern about the discretionary nature of pierces 
funding decisions in the program soon after his appointment in 
october 1986 
demery said as a result of his persistence a selection 
committee was set up in january 1987 but pierce retained final 
approval over its recommendations 
rep joseph kennedy dmass warned that the inspector 
generals conclusions might compromise any future investigation 
rep marci kaptur dohio indicated she might request that a 
special prosecutor investigate the program 
i dont really hear legal reasoning i hear administrative 
reasoning in the inspector generals conclusions she said 
other democrats on the panel also questioned adams and demery 
about how the congressionally mandated fair share allocations 
to the states and regulations for public notice of competitive 
bidding for contracts were circumvented 
peter pretorius the founder of food for africa a favored 
charity of demerys made a surprise appearance adams report 
indicated that food had received large donations from several 
developers that won contracts to renovate housing under the federal 
rehabilitation program

reyes syndrome cases have fallen dramatically in 
nine years as a result of warnings about the links between aspirin 
and the childhood disease federal health researchers say 
just 20 cases of reyes syndrome were reported in 1988 the 
national centers for disease control reported thursday at its peak 
in 1980 reyes syndrome afflicted 555 people 
the 1988 count is the lowest since national surveillance of 
reyes cases was begun in 1976 the cdc said 
the disease struck 101 americans in 1986 the year in which 
aspirin containers were first required to carry warnings about it 
only 36 cases were reported in 1987 the cdc said 
the ailment first observed in the 1950s causes severe vomiting 
and lethargy and can result in coma and death it usually occurs in 
children and is generally preceded by a bout with a viral illness 
such as influenza or chicken pox 
researchers have documented a link between the use of aspirin by 
young patients during chicken pox or flu and the subsequent 
development of reyes syndrome 
the decline in the number of rs cases since late 1980 
coincides with the increased publicity about this association 
the atlantabased cdc said 
study after study shows aspirin is the primary cause of reyes 
syndrome said dr larry schonberger a cdc researcher who 
termed the 1988 count shockingly low compared with previous 
levels 
at least 10 of the 36 patients in 1987 died in 1988 five of 17 
patients for whom the outcome is known died 
nine of the 20 reported reyes syndrome patients in 1988 had 
suffered respiratory illness such as flu before the onset of the 
reyes four had chicken pox the previous year 18 of the 36 
patients had respiratory illnesses and seven had chicken pox

prime minister yitzhak shamir was released from 
jerusalems hadassah hospital today after undergoing two days of 
tests following complaints of fatigue shamirs office said 
mr shamir is feeling well and is in excellent mood he will 
rest at home during the weekend and will return to work sunday a 
spokeswoman at prime ministers office said 
officials at haddasah confirmed that shamir 73 intended to 
attend a crucial cabinet debate on his middle east peace plan 
our prime minister took us by surprise and decided to leave 
three hours earlier than scheduled hospital spokeswoman ruth 
mekel said i think he went first to his home as far as i 
understand he resumes work sunday and will attend the cabinet 
meeting 
mrs mekel quoted shamirs doctors as saying the premiers tests 
were good and that his physical condition was excellent 
however neither she nor officials in shamirs office would say 
what tests he underwent or provide details of his illness 
he only complained of fatigue mrs mekel said he really 
worked very hard after returning from abroad 
shamir traveled to the united states in april to unveil his 
peace plan calling for elections among palestinians living in the 
israelioccupied territories 
tuesday night shamir struck his head in a fall and complained 
later he felt weak according to his spokesman yossi ahimeir 
however during israels independence day celebrations which 
ran from tuesday night to wednesday night shamir appeared at a 
halfdozen rallies 
at the international bible quiz on wednesday he was wearing 
dark glasses with a large reddish welt visible on his right cheek 
the lack of official comment on the nature of shamirs illness 
or what tests he was given prompted complaints by israeli media 
they noted that illnesses of foreign leaders notably americans 
usually brought detailed reports from government officials

citizens more than 20000 us civilians many of them retirees 
live in the central american country 
denounced the regime of panamanian military leader gen manuel 
antonio noriega and said he is recalling us ambassador arthur 
davis bush said the embassy staff also will be reduced 
directed that us government employees and their dependents 
living outside of military bases be returned to the united states 
or relocated to the bases along the panama canal

president bushs decision to order more us 
troops into panama and evacuate some american dependents in the 
wake of aborted elections and the beating of opposition leaders is 
another benchmark in the twoyear slide in relations between the 
two nations 
twentyfive years ago the united states and panama actually 
broke off diplomatic ties temporarily following antiamerican 
riots but the more recent government of gen manuel antonio 
noriega himself charged in the united states with drug 
trafficking has caused even more frustration and anger in 
washington 
here is a chronology of key events related to the noriega regime 
june 1987 col roberto diaz herrera the retiring 
secondincommand of the defense forces accuses noriega of 
drugrelated activities of rigging the 1984 election in favor of 
government candidates and of murdering dr hugo spadafora a 
former vice minister of health who had accused noriega of drug 
trafficking 
june 9 1987 a protest movement headed by the national civic 
crusade a grouping of professionals and students demands a probe 
into herreras allegations and a return to democracy street 
protests are crushed brutally 
feb 4 1988 a federal grand jury in miami indicts noriega on 
drug running charges a grand jury in tampa returns similar 
indictments 
feb 25 1988 president eric delvalle who was put in place by 
noriega announces he has fired his patron eight hours later the 
national assembly meets ousts delvalle and names manuel solis 
palma as minister in charge of the presidency a title he retains 
the united states refuses to recognize solis palma the government 
closes opposition news media 
march 16 1988 a coup organized by defense forces officers 
against noriega fails demonstrations erupt in the capital and a 
power outage blacks out the nation 
march 28 1988 after a large antinoriega march members of 
the defense forces enter the marriott hotel beating and arresting 
journalists and opposition leaders 
april 9 1988 the united states announces economic sanctions 
that prohibit american companies and the government from making 
payments to the panamanian government some 56 million in 
panamanian funds in american banks are frozen the united states 
tries to negotiate the departure of noriega without success 
may 9 1988 banks reopen but with severe restrictions

the army battalions on their way to panama 
include one from a light division organized for quick movement 
around the world and one from a standard mechanized division that 
trains to fight with personnel carriers and tanks 
the one company from the 2nd marine division meantime is the 
first to deploy on a realworld mission in what the corps calls its 
light armored vehicle or lav 
president bush ordered the battalions to panama on thursday 
the lav is an armored eightwheel personnel carrier that sports 
a 25mm chain gun which is a highspeed heavy type of machine gun 
as well as a 762mm machine gun 
the 7th light infantry division and the 5th infantry division 
are part of different corps within the army i and iii 
respectively and are based at different parts of the country 
fort ord calif and fort polk la 
they also reflect deliberately different capabilities 
the 7th known as the bayonet division was the first of four 
activeduty light infantry divisions created by the army during the 
reagan administration although the 7th has a long history as a 
regular army division it didnt become a light infantry division 
until oct 1 1985 
with about 10700 soldiers assigned to it instead of the roughly 
17000 assigned to a normal mechanized division the 7th is full of 
riflemen carries no heavy vehicles and deploys with only modest 
amounts of artillery and antitank weapons 
the idea behind the light divisions championed by former army 
chief of staff gen john wickham was to provide a president the 
option of using a fairly large force that could be moved rapidly 
around the world 
for example a normal heavy division such as those assigned to 
europe would require about 2850 flights of a c141 to deploy a 
complete light division could show up for combat with just 500 
flights 
the 7th was one of two army units the other being the 82nd 
airborne tapped for a similar emergency deployment to central 
america in march 1988 in that case the troops were sent to 
honduras because of incursions by nicaraguan troops 
the 5th infantry division meantime is a standard mechanized 
division whose history dates to world war i known as the red 
diamond division the 5th fought in four major campaigns during 
world war i and five major campaigns in europe during world war ii 
the 5th includes three activeduty mechanized brigades which 
rely on armored personnel carriers such as the m113 or the bradley 
fighting vehicle and three activeduty armor brigades equipped 
with m1a1 tanks 
one ranking military official said thursday a mechanized force 
was being sent as a precaution in case the situation in panama 
deteriorated further and additional protection was needed to help 
dependents evacuate 
although a mechanized infantry division can be transported by 
air the heavy equipment makes it a slow process in this case the 
pentagon announced the one battalion from the 5th would travel to 
panama by sea aboard the ship bellatrix 
the marines meantime are sending alpha co of the 2nd light 
armored infantry battalion that unit will be traveling by aircraft 
with 18 of the new lavs 
the 2nd marine division traces its roots to feb 1 1941 when 
it was formed for world war ii during that war the division 
fought in some of the bloodiest battles of the pacific including 
guadalcanal tarawa and okinawa 
the 2nd also went to lebanon in 1958 and 1982 to the dominican 
republic in 1965 and to grenada in 1983 it fights under the 
motto second to none

us health officials are urging testing 
isolation and other measures to curb the spread of tuberculosis in 
the nations prisons 
centers for disease control researchers cited a survey in 29 
states where prisons reported 31 tuberculosis cases per 100000 
inmates in 198485 compared with eight cases per 100000 among 
nonincarcerated adults in those states during the same period 
in some large correctional systems the incidence of tb has 
increased dramatically the cdc said in its report thursday 
it noted especially high rates in new york new jersey and 
california 
tuberculosis a contagious bacterial lung disease infects 
about 22000 people each year in the united states most can be 
cured with drug treatment scientists estimate that about 10 
million americans are infected with the virus but the vast 
majority will never get the disease 
the spread of aidsvirus infections during this decade may play 
a part in the spread of tb in prisons the atlantabased cdc said 
aids weakens the immune systems of patients making them more 
susceptible to infections which other people might fight off 
including tuberculosis 
tests for acquired immune deficiency syndrome should be offered 
to all inmates with known tb infections the cdc report said 
persons at highest risk are close contacts the cdc 
said noting that tb can pose particular problems in prisons 
where the environment is often conducive to airborne transmission 
of infection among inmates staff and visitors 
the cdc committee recommends new tests at least once a year 
rapid chest xrays for tbinfected people showing symptoms and 
isolation for those with suspected or confirmed symptomatic tb 
cases 
isolation should include separate ventilation systems to cut 
down the risk of airborne transmission of tb the committee said 
it may be necessary to move a patient to another facility or 
hospital with a respiratory isolation facility the panel said 
prison overcrowding may be a cause for spreading tb said dr 
dixie snider a cdc tuberculosis specialist 
in new york there were 106 tb cases per 100000 inmates in 1986 
seven times more than the average of 15 cases reported in 197678 
inmates in new jersey had a tb rate of 110 per 100000 in 1987 
11 times higher than the general new jersey population in 
california the 80 per 100000 rate was nearly six times higher 
than in the general population

the nations top business leaders today 
predicted that economic growth this year will taper off from an 
already slackening pace but they nonetheless radiated confidence 
that a recession can be avoided 
in its semiannual forecast the business council predicted that 
growth as measured by the gross national product will fall to 29 
percent this year and to 17 percent in 1990 
although that would represent a significant slowdown from the 
healthy 39 percent pace posted last year the council expressed 
general optimism that no economic downturn is likely in the 
next two years 
indeed the councils consensus report forecasts that growth 
will rebound in the latter part of 1990 rising from 14 percent in 
the first quarter to 31 percent by the fourth quarter 
this suggests not only that recession will be avoided but that 
the economy could be headed in 1991 toward an unprecedented ninth 
year of peacetime cyclical expansion the report said 
the council made up of executives of 65 of the nations largest 
corporations said the anticipated slowergrowth trend for the near 
future comes largely from an expectation that exports and business 
investment will contribute less to the economy this year than in 
1988 
the panels economists also expressed concern about worsening 
inflation extending into 1990 with some corporate analysts 
expecting price increases to advance at an annual pace exceeding 6 
percent 
inflation worries have heightened this year as several sharp 
monthly advances in the consumer price index combined to pace a 61 
percent annual inflation rate during the first quarter 
the councils consensus call is for a 5 percent rise in consumer 
prices in both 1989 and 1990 up from 44 percent in the past two 
years 
the central view is that although the flareup of prices early 
in 1989 was an aberration price behavior overall will not improve 
appreciably until mid1990 the report cautioned 
it said future price increases would be held down somewhat by a 
falloff in oil prices which were a big part of the firstquarter 
surge in inflation 
the councils report based on the judgment of 19 corporate 
economists said a minority of the analysts remain concerned about 
the lagging effects of inflation and believes that there will be 
echoes from both the earlier period of strong economic growth and 
the oil episode for some time after growth decelerates 
that is the recipe for socalled stagflation a period when 
prices continue to rise even as the economy loses steam 
the federal reserve board concerned about the nations 
disturbing inflation numbers has been pushing up interest rates 
for the past year in an effort to ease inflationary pressures by 
restraining economic growth 
it is the feds antiinflation campaign that has a growing 
number of private analysts worried the central bank may 
unintentionally push the nation into a recession as it tries to 
hold the economy to a more sustainable level of growth 
but the business councils judgment was that the further fed 
tightening is unlikely contributing to expectations of a long life 
for the current economic expansion which already has achieved a 
peacetime record at more than six years 
walter v shipley chairman of chemical banking corp summed up 
the councils three reasons for optimism it doesnt believe 
there are major imbalances in the economy at this time it doesnt 
think the fed is going to nudge interest rates much higher and it 
sees other industrial economies continuing to perform strongly 
thereby providing support for american exports 
the council did express some concern that less progress is 
likely this year and in 1990 on reducing the countrys massive 
trade deficit although it expects continuing moderate gains 
the 1990 trade gap is forecast at 100 billion down from 
11976 billion in 1988 and 15212 billion in 1987 
the projection for some ongoing improvement was partly based on 
an expectation that slower economic growth in the united states 
will dampen import demand even as export demand is sustained 
in addition the council said the dollar is likely to decline 
in value against other major currencies helping make us products 
more competitive overseas 
the economic forecast was issued at the start of a twoday 
conference at which the executives will hear from speakers such as 
fed chairman alan greenspan members of the congressional budget 
committees and richard breeden a key adviser to president bush on 
domestic issues

a string of rare bird thefts at several 
zoos around the country is prompting more stringent security and 
even leading some zoos to pull the valuable animals from exhibits 
on may 2 a thief broke into the parrot cage at the rio grande 
zoological park here and took an australian king parrot a 
sulphurcrested cockatoo and a dusky lory 
the crimson and green parrot one of only 12 such birds in 
captivity was found dead on the zoo grounds the lory a 
shorttailed parrot flew back to the zoo the white cockatoo with 
a pale yellow crest is missing 
im hopeful that whoever did it got chewed up sufficiently 
said zoo director john moore these birds are not real kind 
the global destruction of rain forests the birds natural 
habitat and export restrictions imposed by foreign countries have 
driven up the value of rare birds and encouraged thefts officials 
say 
zoos in los angeles san diego el paso texas columbia sc 
and elsewhere have been hit in recent years 
there are people willing to pay just like art collectors i 
suppose without asking questions said mike cunningham 
associate curator of birds at the los angeles zoo 
if the birds are really rare its hard to find out where they 
go its like somebody stealing a work of art they dont take it 
to the corner store and sell it 
zoos are prime targets because they often hold rare species that 
arent available to the pet trade he says 
the lucrative black market also attracts smugglers 
a lot of the same people that smuggle narcotics are smuggling 
birds the return is just as great said john cross assistant 
regional director of law enforcement for the us fish and wildlife 
service in albuquerque 
the us customs service seizes rare birds almost daily along 
the border with mexico which outlaws commercial exports said 
charles conroy a customs spokesman in houston 
large cages are strapped to wooden rafts floated across the 
rio grande conroy said we even had one case where a woman who 
had an artificial leg brought six birds across in this artificial 
leg that has been hollowed out 
zoo officials would not put a price on the birds 
in one respect theyre priceless said san diego zoo 
spokesman jeff jouett in another respect i dont want to give 
an incentive to anyone that would endanger the lives of these 
birds 
the zoo lost a pair of australian cockatoos which are gray with 
red markings about a year ago 
palmer krantz director of the riverbank zoo in columbia sc 
also declined to discuss prices 
when people visit the zoo we want them to visit for the 
beauty and educational value of the animal not that it may be 
worth 20000 or 15000 he said 
zoos that have been hit by thieves have beefed up security and 
some no longer exhibit their rarest birds 
the birds that are highly saleable like the rare cockatoos 
and rare parrots we dont have on display said cunningham of 
los angeles thats the sad part of it all you cant display 
something like that in a zoo because somebodys going to rip it 
off 
claudia newman said the el paso zoo has pulled its rare birds 
off display loaned them to other zoos or sold them because of 
thefts two parrots were stolen from the zoo in february and an 
african gray parrot was taken about six months ago she said 
many curators find it difficult to take such steps though 
the taxpayers pay for this and they ought to be able to see 
it said moore of the rio grande zoological park but if it 
gets to the point we cant keep rare birds maybe i think we 
ought not to have them

the deployment of additional american troops 
to panama will bolster the us presence there with armored 
vehicles as well as additional manpower once it is completed in a 
week or more 
dan howard the pentagons chief spokesman said president bush 
on thursday ordered 1881 soldiers and marines sent to panama in an 
operation the defense department called nimrod dancer 
the units will include two army battalions and one marine 
company howard said and the marines and one of the army 
battalions will be bringing a large number of vehicles with them 
a battalion from the 5th infantry division at fort polk la 
will travel to panama by sea with 726 soldiers and 59 m113 armored 
personnel carriers six m106 mortar vehicles and 106 support 
vehicles 
the marine company meantime will travel by air with 18 light 
armored vehicles a relatively new weapon introduced to marine 
forces in 1984 that has eight wheels can ford streams and carries 
a 22mm chain gun and 762mm machine gun 
one pentagon official who requested anonymity said the defense 
department had made a deliberate decision to move in armored 
personnel carriers because of a concern they might be needed to 
evacuate americans 
the other army battalion is being dispatched by air from the 7th 
light infantry division at fort ord calif howard said it will 
include 890 soldiers in a battalion plus one headquarters company 
of 100 soldiers 
the spokesman said some of the initial elements of the 7th light 
infantry division and of the 2nd marine division at camp lejeune 
nc could depart for panama within the next 24 hours 
the first soldiers headed south thursday night as almost 1000 
infantry troops left fort ord the 7th light infantry division at 
fort ord dispatched 880 combat troops and 100 cooks medics and 
other support soldiers to travis air force base 160 miles away 
for the flight to central america 
but howard added a total of 70 airplane flights using c141 
cargo planes and several days will be required to complete the 
aerial deployment of the troops and marines 
as for the 5th infantry divisions battalion with its heavier 
equipment howard declined to estimate how long the voyage by sea 
would take but other sources said roughly a week would be 
required 
the battalion must travel from fort polk to beaumont texas to 
load up on the military sealift command ship bellatrix for the 
voyage howard said 
the spokesman added the troops would be sent to us military 
installations in panama for the sole purpose of protecting the 
lives of american citizens and ensuring security of the canal 
itself 
but he said the united states would exercise its right of access 
to use public roads in panama and that there was no end time 
for bringing the troops home 
howard also said the us southern command which is based in 
panama had begun notifying the families of servicemen living off 
military bases to move to one of the 10 military bases the united 
states still operates in panama 
the spokesman said the families of servicemen who were command 
sponsored meaning they were there under official us government 
sponsorship were being ordered to bases 
the families who are not command sponsored are being urged to 
move to military installations but cannot be forced to do so 
howard said 
according to the pentagon there are about 14000 dependents of 
servicemen and defense department employees living in panama of 
whom 3081 live off base of that total 1396 are 
commandsponsored and 1685 are not

the first test flight 
of an unarmed midgetman missile was cut short when air force 
officials destroyed the rocket after a malfunction 
the missile began tumbling about 70 seconds after launch 
thursday morning as its second stage was firing a range safety 
officer issued a command that destroyed the missile two minutes and 
nine seconds into flight said maj gen ed barry director of the 
midgetman program 
this was a partial success in that we achieved 50 percent of 
our flight objectives barry said 
excellent telemetry data was received on the first stage and 
most of the second stage he said the missile was destroyed 10 to 
12 seconds before the third stage was to ignite 
the midgetman is designed to be fired from a mobile trucklike 
launcher and has been in development since 1983 
steam pressure popped the missile 150 to 200 feet out of a 
launch canister on a pad then its first stage rocket motor ignited 
and boosted it across the partly cloudy windy sky 
the missile was supposed to deliver a dummy warhead to a test 
range about 4600 miles away in the kwajalein atoll about 30 
minutes after launch 
barry said congressional critics shouldnt view the test as a 
setback this is a developmental flight testing program he 
said 
the midgetman formally the small intercontinental ballistic 
missile is designed to carry a single nuclear warhead to a target 
up to 6900 miles away 
its future is clouded by an intense political debate over 
whether the united states should develop one or two mobile 
landbased missiles for its nuclear arsenal the soviet union 
already has developed and begun deploying two such missiles the 
united states has none 
a version of the 10warhead mx missile that could be launched 
from a railroad car is favored by defense secretary dick cheney 
who says the pentagon would be hard pressed by the 25 billion cost 
of 500 midgetmans 
but president bush recently decided that both the mx and the 
midgetman should be developed

about 2500 chinese moslems chanting punish 
chinas rushdie marched through beijing today demanding two 
editors be imprisoned for publishing a book on the sexual habits of 
moslems 
these men must be jailed said li jing a uighur turk from 
the central academy of nationalities and a leader of the protest 
if they disappeared from the face of the earth we would be 
happy 
the protest came a day after iranian president ali khamenei told 
a news conference in beijing that iran still demands the execution 
of british author salman rushie who is accused of blaspheming the 
islamic religion in his book satanic verses 
the chinese book in question is called sex habits a 
compilation of essays on the sexual tastes of people around the 
world 
the section on islam says that the purpose of a moslems 
pilgrammage to mecca is to engage in bestiality it said the domes 
and towers of moslem mosques symbolize human sex organs 
in an unusually early report by chinese standards beijings 
afternoon newspaper the beijing evening news reported the 
demonstration it also said the book had been banned in beijing 
because it has hurt the unity of chinas minorities 
the city communist party committee and city government clearly 
stated that this book must be swiftly suppressed the paper said 
the demonstration which included students from eight school and 
13 minority groups twisted through the streets of beijings moslem 
quarter to the niujie mosque bejings oldest 
mullahs at the temple set out tea for the marches and police 
directed traffic out of their path the demonstration was the first 
in more than three weeks of student protests in beijing to be given 
official approval earlier protests have called for a free press 
and democracy 
allah is great the crowd chanted as it marched down the 
street down with blasphemy 
a member of the uzbek minority led the protest cradling a 
framed letter of permission from the beijing public security 
bureau hundreds of men in white fezzes and women in colored 
scarves followed 
we support them fully said ma yue an official at the 
niujie mosque as he watched the marchers pass these men should 
not be allowed to publish this stuff they have seriously insulted 
the moslem peoples 
uighur turks who inhabit the northwest province of xinjiang 
are also known to clash occasionally with local chinese in smaller 
protests 
the books editors are han chinese the main ethnic group in 
china comprising more than 90 percent of the population they are 
apparently teachers from shanxi province but published the book 
under pen names 
the book has been selling rapidly since it was published by the 
shanghai cultural publishing co in march chinese sources said 
that in early may the shanghai city government stopped a second 
printing of the book which had already sold 50000 copies 
city officials also are trying to recall the book offering 
three times its official price of 94 cents but to no avail they 
said 
the black market price has already hit 50 yuan 1350 
said one chinese journalist familiar with the book 
on the street students passed out leaflets 
our great and holy islam religion has again been insulted by 
vicious scoundrels read one pamphlet referring to the first 
insult as being the rushdie affair facing this kind of brazen 
insult how can a true moslem remain aloof 
the demonstration ended at tiananmen square where student 
leaders presented a letter to the national peoples congress 
chinas legislature calling for the imprisonment of the editors 
one moslem student who watched from the protest from the niujie 
mosque said he supported the demonstration but did not believe the 
editors should be jailed 
its just like the rushdie case he said we shouldnt 
kill these people or throw them in jail we should criticize them 
i may be a moslem but i am also a modern youth

public health workers should hit the streets to 
warn about the danger of aids among the nations 12 million 
intravenous drug abusers up to onethird of whom may already be 
infected a researcher says 
outreach seems to be a very important component of the fight 
against the spread of the virus said dr robert a hahn of the 
centers for disease control in atlanta 
hahn urged the antiaids effort in conjunction with a study he 
and a team of researchers published in todays journal of the 
american medical association 
about 15 percent of intravenous drug abusers are in drug 
treatment at any given time he said 
that percentage could be increased by health workers going out 
into the streets finding out where they are and what theyre doing 
trying to get them into therapy trying to educate them hahn 
said 
the researchers reviewed 92 studies of intravenous drug abusers 
in late 1987 and found wide regional variation in the rates of 
infection with the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv which 
causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
the highest rates were in the northeast where the prevalence 
depending on the study was 10 percent to 65 percent and in puerto 
rico where the prevalence was 45 percent to 59 percent 
lower rates were found in the south atlantic region 7 percent 
to 29 percent as well as in metropolitan atlanta with 10 percent 
and in detroit and san francisco both 7 percent to 13 percent the 
researchers said 
in the west midwest and south infections occurred among 5 
percent or less of drug abusers tested 
the wide variation in hiv prevalences found in this survey 
indicates an opportunity to prevent increases in many areas of the 
united states the researchers wrote 
the total number of infected drug users could be from 61000 to 
398000 or 5 percent to 33 percent of the total injection 
drugabusing us population the study found 
at least 94280 americans have contracted aids since 1979 and 
54402 of them have died according to cdc figures as of april 30 
the virus that causes the incurable and fatal syndrome is passed 
mainly through sexual intercourse shared hypodermic needles and 
from infected mothers to their infants before or during birth 
intravenous drug users comprise 20 percent of adult cases 
reported so far and homosexual and bisexual men who also inject 
drugs make up another 7 percent of adult cases according to cdc 
figures 
the proportion of drug abuserelated aids cases has risen in 
recent years the cdc said in march that 10747 drugrelated aids

an interview with former hungarian 
leader janos kadar seems to contradict official reports he is 
gravely ill and suggests the path to reform is not entirely cleared 
neither kadar nor magyarorszag the conservative magazine 
publishing the interview today indicate he is in the dire state of 
health claimed by party officials who stripped him of his last 
posts earlier this week 
it is presumed they acted at the urging of communist party 
reformers troubled by increasing indications that kadar played a 
role in official repressions after the 1956 anticommunist revolt 
kadar is rumored to have resisted the push for more democracy 
since he was replaced as communist party leader a year ago 
state television reported last week that kadars secretary 
robert ribanszky has found a conservative communist party faction 
that threatens to establish an independent more hardline party 
the first installment of the interview to be serialized by the 
weekly magazine is accompanied by a picture of the 76yearold 
kadar casually dressed and relaxed behind a desk 
he refers to minor health problems in the interview a rarity 
since his departure from the top party post 
party central committee secretary gyoergy fejti told reporters 
kadar was stripped of his honorary title of party president monday 
because he is gravely ill in a seemingly irreversible process 
the new party chief karoly grosz said this month that kadar is 
disabled by lung disease 
state radio tuesday reported that kadar spoke incoherently at an 
april 12 central committee session other officials refer to 
serious mental and physical impairments 
magyarorszags motives for portraying kadar in a more vibrant 
light and giving him a platform to recount his 32year leadership 
were not immediately known but the newspaper may be in the control 
of antireformists 
andras kanyo magyarorszags new chief editor added to the 
mystery by refusing to tell the associated press when the interview 
with kadar was conducted and hinting next weeks issue will 
contain some major disclosure 
but it was clear from references to the april 12 central 
committee session that kadar gave the interview within the last 
month 
kadar referred to the trial of laszlo rajk the former foreign 
minister executed in 1949 after conviction on trumpedup charges 
the repressions against rajk and execution of imre nagy for his 
leading role in the 1956 revolt are among incidents kadar has been 
linked with 
kadar denied playing an important part in rajks trial or 
confession of alleged treason the government daily magyar hirlap 
on saturday printed an account by former senior communist mihaly 
farkas that told how he and kadar personally approved rajks 
beating by the secret police 
in a letter wednesday to the central committee kadar said he 
has made mistakes but asked hungarian communists to believe he 
always acted with good intent 
he said his doctors had ordered him to cut back on work last 
november and that his health took an unspecified turn for the worse 
in april 
but the letter shed no light on the continuing mystery 
surrounding his whereabouts and physical condition

announce today whether he accepted the agreement

minneapolis lawyer for the hotel as saying the settlement would be 
substantially less than the 200 million for the the 1980 mgm hotel 
fire in las vegas 
plaintiffs in the case being tried in us district court in 
san juan had sought damages of 18 billion 
a former hotel maintenance worker pleaded guilty to setting the 
dupont plaza fire during a labor dispute at the 22story hotel 
which was packed with almost 1000 tourists about 140 people were 
injured 
the hotel was cited for 25 violations by the occupational safety 
and health administration including lack of emergency exits from 
the casino where 84 of the victims died 
richard bieder whose bridgeport conn law firm represents the 
families of the nine connecticut people killed in the blaze 
confirmed wednesday there was a settlement but refused to discuss 
the amount 
fetterly said the settlement did not cover claims against about 
170 defendants including those who provided furnishings and 
services in the hotel

about 2500 chinese moslems chanting punish 
chinas rushdie marched through beijing today demanding two 
editors be imprisoned for publishing a book on the sexual habits of 
moslems 
these men must be jailed said li jing a uighur turk from 
the central academy of nationalities and a leader of the protest 
if they disappeared from the face of the earth we would be 
happy 
the protest came a day after iranian president ali khamenei told 
a news conference in beijing that iran still demands the execution 
of british author salman rushie who is accused of blaspheming the 
islamic religion in his book satanic verses 
the chinese book in question is called sex habits a 
compilation of essays on the sexual tastes of people around the 
world 
the section on islam says that the purpose of a moslems 
pilgrammage to mecca is to engage in bestiality it said the domes 
and towers of moslem mosques symbolize human sex organs 
in an unusually early report by chinese standards beijings 
afternoon newspaper the beijing evening news reported the 
demonstration it also said the book had been banned in beijing 
because it has hurt the unity of chinas minorities 
the city communist party committee and city government clearly 
stated that this book must be swiftly suppressed the paper said 
the demonstration which included students from eight school and 
13 minority groups twisted through the streets of beijings moslem 
quarter to the niujie mosque bejings oldest 
mullahs at the temple set out tea for the marches and police 
directed traffic out of their path the demonstration was the first 
in more than three weeks of student protests in beijing to be given 
official approval earlier protests have called for a free press 
and democracy 
allah is great the crowd chanted as it marched down the 
street down with blasphemy 
a member of the uzbek minority led the protest cradling a 
framed letter of permission from the beijing public security 
bureau hundreds of men in white fezzes and women in colored 
scarves followed 
we support them fully said ma yue an official at the 
niujie mosque as he watched the marchers pass these men should 
not be allowed to publish this stuff they have seriously insulted 
the moslem peoples 
uighur turks who inhabit the northwest province of xinjiang 
are also known to clash occasionally with local chinese in smaller 
protests 
the books editors are han chinese the main ethnic group in 
china comprising more than 90 percent of the population they are 
apparently teachers from shanxi province but published the book 
under pen names 
the book has been selling rapidly since it was published by the 
shanghai cultural publishing co in march chinese sources said 
that in early may the shanghai city government stopped a second 
printing of the book which had already sold 50000 copies 
city officials also are trying to recall the book offering 
three times its official price of 94 cents but to no avail they 
said 
the black market price has already hit 50 yuan 1350 
said one chinese journalist familiar with the book 
on the street students passed out leaflets 
our great and holy islam religion has again been insulted by 
vicious scoundrels read one pamphlet referring to the first 
insult as being the rushdie affair facing this kind of brazen 
insult how can a true moslem remain aloof 
the demonstration ended at tiananmen square where student 
leaders presented a letter to the national peoples congress 
chinas legislature calling for the imprisonment of the editors 
one moslem student who watched from the protest from the niujie 
mosque said he supported the demonstration but did not believe the 
editors should be jailed 
its just like the rushdie case he said we shouldnt 
kill these people or throw them in jail we should criticize them 
i may be a moslem but i am also a modern youth

senior politician masayoshi ito today officially 
refused a ruling party request that he take over as prime minister 
to restore confidence in the government following an 
influencepeddling scandal 
leaders of the governing liberal democratic party had wanted 
ito one of a handful of experienced leaders untainted by the 
recruit co scandal to replace prime minister noboru takeshita to 
improve the partys image ahead of summer elections for half the 
seats in parliaments upper house 
mr ito formally expressed his rejection and despite party 
leaders persistent attempts to persuade him didnt change his 
position party deputy secretary general ryutaro hashimoto told a 
news conference 
ito rejected a series of appeals by party secretary general 
shintaro abe hashimoto said adding that itos refusal left the 
party at a loss 
we cant just accept his rejection as it is and requested him 
to reconsider once again hashimoto said 
but the 75yearold ito a diabetic has repeatedly said he is 
not interested in becoming party president and thus prime 
minister citing his age and poor health 
hashimoto said itos reasons for rejecting leadership were his 
health and disagreement with party leaders on the way it was taking 
responsibility for the scandal and on measures for party reform 
the kyodo news service said ito had told takeshita all party 
figures linked to the scandal should resign from parliament but 
the prime minister had rejected it as an impractical idea 
whoever is chosen to head the ruling party becomes prime 
minister because of the partys large majority in parliament 
itos formal denial has left the conservatives without a strong 
candidate to replace takeshita who has said he will step down 
after this years budget is passed by parliament expected later 
this month 
party sources said abe intends to resign his party post if he 
fails in his assigned job of persuading ito to become prime 
minister 
takeshita who has admitted receiving more than 111 million in 
donations from recruit an information services conglomerate 
announced april 25 he would resign to take responsibility for 
public outrage over the scandal 
three of his cabinet ministers have resigned over the scandal 
and 14 businessmen and exbureaucrats have been arrested on bribery 
or other charges in connection with sales of unlisted 
bargainpriced shares in a recruit subsidiary 
on thursday takeshita wined and dined ito as the party sought 
to convince him to take over the job 
after his dinner meeting with takeshita late thursday however 
ito said he had not changed his mind 
ito said his talks with takeshita had centered on reform of the 
party 
revolutionary changes in the partys way of thinking are 
needed ito said

national party leader fw de 
klerk expected to become the next president said today that he 
seeks a drastically changed political system in which neither 
the white minority nor black majority can dominate 
in his most detailed policy speech since becoming party leader 
feb 2 de klerk told parliament that establishment of a 
oneperson onevote system would lead to black majority rule 
which he termed totally unacceptable 
but excluding blacks from decisionmaking as advocated by the 
farright conservative party would ultimately lead to conflict 
and revolution that would destroy the very security and freedom of 
whites which the conservative party claims to be protecting de 
klerk said 
he said the national party sought a system in which decisions 
were made by consensus disputes should be settled by a fair 
referee he said without elaborating 
white security can never be built on injustice toward 
others he said the present situation cannot last 
indefinitely things will have to change drastically and quickly 
klerk 53 became party leader when the post was vacated by 
president pw botha who suffered a stroke in january botha head 
of government since 1978 plans to retire after a general election 
on sept 6 and de klerk the education minister is virtually 
assured of succeeding him 
the national party is expected to retain its overwhelming 
majority in the dominant white chamber of parliament despite 
challenges from the conservative party and the antiapartheid 
democratic party 
the conservative party stands for a minority government in a 
south africa that will by its own admission in perpetuity be 
populated by a majority of people of color it is unfair and does 
not pass the test of justice de klerk said 
the democratic party stands for a majority government in a 
country with such a massive and wide diversity as ours this is 
unfair to the smaller peoples and population groups their policy 
too fails the test of justice 
de klerks speech came a day after a fellow cabinet member and 
senior party leader constitutional development minister chris 
heunis announced his resignation last week heunis made a speech 
suggesting that blacks be given a role in parliament in the 
cabinet and in the selection of a president 
parliament currently includes subordinate chambers for asians 
and people of mixedrace but the 28 million blacks have no formal 
role of any sort in national politics 
de klerk played down the significance of heunis speech saying 
to deduce from his speech that the national party is now 
following in the democratic partys tracks on the way to majority 
rule is untrue 
the conservative party leader andries treurnicht nonethelesss 
charged that the govermnments policies would lead to black rule 
south africa is at the end of a failed political experiment 
and the national party government is in disarray treurnicht said

john p macks desk at the capitol is empty 
today but questions remain about the balance between justice and 
forgiveness following his resignation amid a furor over his brutal 
attack on a woman 16 years ago 
a top aide to house speaker jim wright and one of the most 
powerful staff members in congress mack resigned thursday saying 
i wish i could rewrite the past but unfortunately i cant 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo cochairwoman of the 
congressional caucus for womens issues called the resignation 
very sad but necessary 
i believe in rehabilitation but not when it leads to such a 
high position she said 
while many people on capitol hill knew the mack story it 
resurfaced last week when the washington post published fresh 
details of the unprovoked 1973 attack in an interview with the 
victim pamela small 
small recounted how mack then a 19yearold store manager 
attacked her with a hammer stabbed her with a steak knife and then 
left her for dead in her car doctors said she was lucky to survive 
at the time wrights daughter was married to macks brother 
although he was sentenced to 15 years in prison mack served just 
27 months and was given a job by wright following his parole he 
rose steadily from a 9000ayear mail clerks position to become 
the 89500ayear head of the democratic steering and policy 
committee which sets the majority partys agenda in the house 
wright said in a statement that he had been willing to give 
this young man another chance and in the intervening years i have 
never had occasion to regret it the speaker already under fire 
and the subject of a house ethics investigation said mack resigned 
without being asked 
rep beryl anthony dark chairman of the democratic 
congressional campaign committee said that after the victims 
account was published there was an immediate reaction that went 
nationwide 
i can understand the emotional outcry he said i heard it 
from my staff we heard it in congressional committees 
as executive director of the steering committee mack was a 
visible figure in the house often working on the floor and running 
meetings for wright 
house majority leader thomas foley dwash said he was very 
sorry that mack resigned and called him one of the most able 
and dedicated employees in congress 
this society believes in forgiveness added rep tony 
coelho dcalif the house majority whip and a close friend of 
macks 
the two were even investors together in dairy management 
associates a business in merced calif coelhos hometown 
according to david dreyer coelhos spokesman 
others were less sympathetic especially in light of smalls 
declaration that mack had never apologized or made any restitution 
for his attack on her 
last week rep lynn martin rill talked with schroeder and 
rep olympia snowe rmaine the other cochair of the womens 
caucus about what course of action to follow snowe said martin 
also broached the subject of mack with wright an aide said 
i think mr mack made the appropriate decision martin said 
following the resignation 
on wednesday snowe one of 26 women in the house said she 
drafted a letter to wright telling him he ought to reconsider 
john mack the message to wright was that he ought to dismiss his 
assistant she said 
snowe who had obtained signatures from several other female gop 
house members said she never gave the letter to the speaker 
because mack resigned making the suggestion moot 
snowe said she believed mack shouldnt hold such an influential 
job when he clearly violated the law didnt finish his sentence 
and didnt pay restitution to small 
rep dan glickman dkan said apparently there was outrage 
among the women members of congress over the mack story rep 
mary rose oakar dohio said shed always found mack to be a 
decent person but the type of crime he committed was very 
offensive 
snowe said women often feel vulnerable when they read 
stories like the one about mack 
but rep barbara boxer dcalif was critical of the timing of 
the posts story at a time when wright is under fire from the house 
ethics committee for his personal financial dealings 
i dont see what has been gained by this she said 
rep charles wilson dtexas said macks success on capitol 
hill obviously upset some people 
we all believe in rehabilitation thats everyonee goal he 
said but he said society wants rehabilitated convicts to be 
carpenters and plumbers not highranking congressional aides

a suspected communist rebel has 
admitted taking part in last months killing of an american 
colonel but investigators have doubts about the confession 
military officials said today 
brig gen cesar nazareno said ricardo prestosa 29 made the 
confession during interrogation today by military officials in 
bataan province where prestosa was arrested wednesday 
nazareno however said no charges have been filed a senior 
officer speaking on condition of anonymity said prestosa 
repeatedly recanted and then repeated the confession and seemed 
confused 
nazareno played a tape to reporters in which prestosa told his 
interrogator that the rebels killed us army col james nick 
rowe because he was a big hindrance to the revolutionary 
movement 
rowe a vietnam veteran who escaped from five years 
imprisonment by the viet cong was gunned down april 21 while on 
his way to work at the joint us military assistance group in the 
manila suburb of quezon city 
the communist new peoples army released a statement the 
following day claiming responsibility for the slaying it said the 
rebels killed rowe because of alleged us interference in the 
philippine governments counterinsurgency campaign 
nazareno said prestosa made the confession to col ramsey 
ocampo constabulary commander in bataan 40 miles west of manila 
but ocampo in a telephone interview denied prestosa admitted 
taking part in the killing 
negative said ocampo reached by telephone at his bataan 
headquarters after nazarenos news conference insofar as our 
investigation is concerned he prestosa is denying it 
when the associated press told him about the nazareno tape 
ocampo said i suggest you talk with camp olivas the regional 
headquarters 
the line was suddenly cut when the associated press reached 
ocampos office later aides said the colonel was out 
ocampo said late thursday that prestosa had denied any 
involvement in the assassination he said intelligence officiers 
believed prestosa was not directly involved but may be in the 
know about the assassination 
in the tape played by nazareno the voice said in tagalog the 
local language that he knew rowe because we had been watching 
him for a long time 
why did you kill him the interrogator asks 
because he was a big hindrance to the revolutionary movement 
nazareno said prestosa said he and five others were in the car 
from which rowes vehicle was sprayed with bullets three blocks 
from his office he said they were armed with two m16 rifles and 
two pistols 
but at least two details in prestosas alleged confession did 
not jibe with fact 
he says in the tape that rowe was killed around 10 am 
police and witnesses said the killing occurred about at 710 am 
the tape says also that the killers abandoned the car in 
manilas paco district but earlier police said they found the car 
in the san francisco del monte district about four miles from paco

the government today urged students not to hold 
prodemocracy demonstrations when soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev visits china next week and a spokesman said officials 
are considering legislation to limit protests 
also today a newspaper said politburo member hu qili met with 
reporters from the china youth news many of whom have been active 
in a journalists movement for freedom of the press 
the china youth news reported that hu responsible for 
supervising chinas staterun media talked with the journalists 
thursday in a cordial harmonious and friendly atmosphere 
it said hu listened to their opinions but it gave no details 
about his reply 
earlier this week chinese journalists gave the government a 
petition signed by more than 1000 reporters requesting a dialogue 
on censorship 
students have marched from their schools to tiananmen square 
seven times during nearly monthlong protests for freedom and 
democracy and about 300 journalists took part in a similar 
demonstration may 4 
government spokesman yuan mu said he hopes students will not 
disrupt the first sinosoviet summit in 30 years 
im sure that the overwhelming majority of the students will 
proceed from the standpoint of maintaining the political and social 
stability in china and act to protect the international prestige of 
china yuan said 
leaders of the student campaign for democratic reforms have 
indicated they may march to tiananmen square in central beijing on 
monday the day gorbachev arrives 
we have not ruled out a demonstration to express our support 
for political reform one activist said thursday 
students at beijing university by thursday night had also 
gathered 1200 signatures for an open invitation to gorbachev to 
speak at chinas most prestigious university 
yuan speaking at a news conference devoted mainly to economic 
matters said if the students do march i think that the correct 
policies and approaches adopted by the chinese government recently 
will be continued to be pursued 
the government after threatening a crackdown and mobilizing 
troops early in the campaign has acted with restraint there has 
been no serious attempt to stop the demonstrations and the 
government has agreed to meet selected students to discuss such 
issues as freedom of the press and official corruption 
activists however accuse the government of stalling in 
responding to their demands that new independently elected student 
groups be recognized and be given a voice in the dialogue 
in a frontpage editorial the peoples daily mouthpiece of the 
communist party also appealed today for calm and stability but 
acknowledged complaints by students are real 
more and more people have realized that there are problems 
existing in our country including the problems raised by students 
these problems can only be solved under circumstances of stability 
and on the track of democracy and law it said 
many beijing students returned to classes this week after tens 
of thousands demonstrated on may 4th the 70th anniversary of 
chinas first democratic movement however large numbers of 
students at beijing university and other schools have continued 
their strike 
yuan said the government is discussing the draft of a law on the 
holding of demonstrations 
yuan said details of the law have yet to be worked out but 
that law will be designed to both protect the exercise of civil 
rights of citizens and at the same time protect social and state 
interests 
chinas constitution guarantees the right to demonstrate but 
since large student demonstrations in 198687 most chinese cities 
have passed regulations stating that planned street marches must 
first receive the approval of local police 
police citing traffic problems rarely approve applications for 
demonstrations and all the student rallies over the past month have 
been technically illegal

chancellor helmut kohl said today he 
welcomed the soviet unions offer to reduce its stockpile of 
shortrange nuclear missiles and tactical weapons 
but kohl at the center of a divisive nato dispute over the 
shortrange missile issue urged the kremlin to take further steps 
to eliminate its superiority in conventional and nuclear forces 
this proposal is certainly a step in the right direction 
kohl said in a statement but we urge once again that the soviet 
union work toward reducing its crass superiority in conventional 
and nuclear forces 
we want to arrive at a point where the soviet union like 
nato already is no longer capable of launching a surprise attack 
or an invasion he said 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev on thursday offered to 
unilaterally remove 500 tactical nuclear warheads from eastern 
europe this year he also proposed superpower negotiations on the 
reduction of shortrange nuclear weapons in europe 
kohls statement on the offer mirrored that of secretary of 
state james a baker iii who called gorbachevs proposal a good 
step but a small step 
kohl said gorbachevs offer was in part the result of his 
continued calls for such cuts 
baker described gorbachevs decision to carry out a unilateral 
reduction of 5 percent from an arsenal of 10000 battlefield 
nuclear weapons as a modest move 
the cuts gorbachev intends to make this year without requiring 
action by nato include 284 shortrange missiles 166 nuclear 
bombs carried by airplanes and 50 nuclear artillery shells 
gorbachev also proposed reductions in tanks combat aircraft and 
artillery pieces 
baker was in brussels today to brief senior nato officials on 
the results of his visit to moscow 
he was expected to meet with west german foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher who along with kohl has urged early 
superpower talks on the reduction of shortrange nuclear weapons 
most of the weapons are in west germany 
the united states and britain have rejected the call saying 
that the warsaw pact was so far ahead in tactical nuclear weapons 
and conventional forces that negotiations could not be considered 
until the imbalance was significantly reduced 
the dispute has split the alliance before a crucial nato summit 
to be held in brussels later this month 
the arms reductions proposals were expected to be a central 
topic of conversation during talks today between kohl and soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze who was in bonn 
in moscow the official tass news agency said shevardnadze would 
discuss a document setting out the fundamental concept of 
relations between the two countries

mayor marion barry arrived at an alleged crack 
house with eviction papers in his hand and television cameras by 
his side surprising 16 people in the apartment and federal agents 
who arrived an hour later to serve a search warrant 
barry directed city workers to nail shut the apartments windows 
and doors thursday agents from the treasury departments bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms soon appeared and tore down the 
plywood boards and ignored the no trespassing signs erected by 
the city 
this is a classic case of no coordination lt reginald l 
smith a city police spokesman told the washington post youre 
going to need coordination to fight this war on drugs and no 
ones talking to each other 
federal agents said their search warrant was based on a previous 
alleged drug purchase at the apartment in the citys southeast 
section where drugrelated violence has been high 
atf spokesman dick pedersen said both local and federal 
authorities were just trying to do their jobs if there is a 
little overlap thats ok no one got hurt he said 
no one was found in the apartment in the federal raid and no one 
was arrested in the city raid conducted by police barry and more 
than a dozen representatives of the city housing department 
a small plastic bag containing what appeared to be 18 rocks of 
crack cocaine worth 50 each was found in the middle of the front 
room during the first raid and confiscated by police 
capt robert boggs who accompanied barry and a handful of 
reporters through the apartment said he could not make arrests 
based on such evidence 
barry said the home was being closed because the tenant listed 
on the lease owes the city 1200 in back rent and the apartment 
had been the scene of a gunfight between an offduty police officer 
and two men wednesday night 
according to housing officials police had raided the residence 
twice before in august and october 1988 and found guns and crack 
the tenant had been given two previous eviction notices but 
because of delays in the eviction process he remained in the 
building they said 
the mayor said he initiated the eviction after he heard over his 
police radio a gunfight between an offduty police officer and two 
men in the neighborhood wednesday night he visited the housing 
project that night and warned residents of the apartment im 
going to put you out 
barrys administration has come under criticism for failing the 
stem the increase in drugrelated violence and the white house has 
chosen washington as the focal point for a new national antidrug 
campaign 
barry himself has been criticized for his personal associations 
including his friendship with a former official of the us virgin 
islands government recently convicted of drug trafficking

once he was compared to magic johnson but lloyd 
daniels a national basketball association allstar in waiting 
never escaped the city streets where his game first flourished 
daniels was in critical condition today after a drugrelated 
shooting it was the latest episode in a troubled 22year life that 
has taken him through five high schools two rehabilitation centers 
and finally to a hospital 
daniels reportedly was shot three times in the neck and torso 
thursday in a dispute over an 8 drug debt 
although his talent helped him receive chance upon chance to 
straighten out his life it might have aggravated some of his 
problems said a close friend of the 6foot8 daniels 
i definitely think certain things were overlooked because of 
his talent said lou dalmeida a basketball fanatic who took 
daniels under his wing four years ago he wasnt required to make 
any decisions early on 
that was the only problem he had trouble making the right 
decisions that and pushing himself in school 
academics were never daniels strong suit i aint allergic to 
no school i just dont want to go he said 
when he arrived at the university of nevadalas vegas in 1987 
daniels could read at a thirdgrade level 
time magazine aptly summed up his diplomaless odyssey through 
five high schools in three states each school had availed itself 
of his talents on the court but never managed to solve his profound 
reading problems 
as he got older daniels began making the wrong decisions he 
was arrested on a drug charge in nevada he began drinking heavily 
his work habits led to his release from two teams within three 
months last year 
but through the drinking the drugs the dropouts daniels had 
one thing to hold on to his game 
at andrew jackson high school in new york city sweet pea 
daniels averaged 312 points 123 rebounds and 10 assists per game 
until quitting in february 1986 
in a high school allstar game several months later daniels 
limited sean higgins a key performer for champion university of 
michigan to 8 points while pouring in 24 himself 
as he was refusing help from a drug rehabilitation program 
daniels was scoring 16 points per game and showing glimpses of his 
old skills with the topeka sizzlers of the continental basketball 
association he wore out his welcome there in just 29 games and was 
cut in february 1988 
while sucking down a case of beer per day he still averaged 27 
points per game in the new zealand basketball federation last year 
but his drinking led to his release in may 1988 
hes as gifted a ball player as ive ever seen said jerry 
tarkanian head coach at college basketball powerhouse unlv 
without question he could have been an nba allstar every year 
tarkanian compared his overall skills to those of los angeles 
lakers star magic johnson st johns university head coach lou 
carnesecca whos handled such homegrown talent as chris mullin 
mark jackson and walter berry said daniels was one of the 
greatest players new york city had ever produced 
recently daniels was showing signs of making another comeback 
he visited the tarkanian family on christmas day and appeared 
clean healthy and ready to play ball tarkanian recalled 
but daniels may be running out of chances if he hasnt run out 
of them already 
im just keeping my fingers crossed now he should learn his 
lesson what else could be more scary than the possibility of 
losing his life asked dalmeida hopefully hell come through

obviously these demands of the chinese side are inconsistent 
with the position it has taken earlier it said 
it said that on march 1 1985 chinas foreign ministry issued a 
statement saying if the vietnamese government decides to pull 
out all of its troops from cambodia the chinese side will right 
after the first withdrawal of vietnamese troops be ready to resume 
negotiations between the two countries 
at the same time as more and more vietnamese troops continue 
to be withdrawn the chinese side will take practical steps to 
improve its relations with vietnam 
vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 and overthrew the 
fanatical khmer rouge which is accused of killing tens of 
thousands of people while trying to set up a marxist agrarian 
system the khmer rouge now is one of three guerrilla factions 
seeking to oust the vietnamesebacked regime 
vietnam has promised to withdraw its troops from cambodia by 
sept 30 but the makeup of a transitional government and fears 
that the khmer rouge will return to power have complicated the 
talks 
on thursday chinese foreign ministry spokesman jin guihua 
blamed vietnam for the failure of the talks between the vice 
ministers 
he said the cambodian issue is one of the major topics on the 
agenda of the may 1518 summit between soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev and chinas top leaders including deng xiaoping he 
indicated china will ask the soviets to urge vietnam to withdraw 
its troops and seek a comprehensive settlement

mediterranean island of cyprus

pledge to hold a national referendum on any new agreement 
under the old accord greece and the united states have until 
june 1990 to reach an agreement before the bases are shut

a police department training session to 
demonstrate the effects of alcohol went sour because of 
insufficient supervision resulting in one participant being 
hospitalized after she passed out the mayor says 
mayor thomas d schneider said further disciplinary action is 
expected because of the may 2 training session 
obviously something went wrong with the way it was done he 
added that drinking is supposed to be a controlled situation 
not getting sloppy fallingdown drunk 
the program was intended to educate 15 volunteer reserve 
officers about effects of alcohol 
police chief robert a jones said three dispatchers and two 
police officers drank alcohol reserve officers then observed their 
behavior gave sobriety tests and used a breathalizer machine to 
measure blood alcohol content 
one dispatcher passed out and was taken by ambulance to 
community north hospital schneider said thursday she was treated 
and released 
officer steve york who is certified to teach the training 
sessions was in charge but jones said capt lana robinson in 
charge of training for the department should have been present 
there was a lack of supervision jones said 
schneider said the incident disappointed him 
what really just irks me to death is that the new reserve 
officers have been given the impression this kind of conduct is 
acceptable behavior when it is in fact totally unacceptable by 
this administration schneider told the indianapolis news 
he said a supervisor should be held accountable there is no 
question that someone will have to pay 
but jones said he did not blame robinson for what happened 
we all have to be broad minded enough to know that we are 
human and we all make mistakes he said

soviet officials said today they were not 
concerned about the presence of us warships in shanghai on the 
day soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev is to visit chinas largest 
city 
i dont think we should overestimate the importance of the 
planned port call by the us navy during gorbachevs visit soviet 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov said 
at least two warships from the 7th fleet are to sail into 
shanghai the afternoon of may 18 when gorbachev is to tour the 
city on his final day in china 
it will be only the second port call by us naval vessels to 
communist china the first was in 1986 to the yellow sea port of 
qingdao 
foreign diplomats see the port call as a clear signal by the 
chinese that better relations with the soviet union will not 
interfere with chinas strong ties with the united states 
china has stressed that gorbachevs visit and normalization of 
longstrained relations with the soviet union will not affect its 
ties with other countries 
gorbachev arrives monday for the first sinosoviet summit in 30 
years 
yevgeny m primakov director of the institute of world economic 
and international relations of the soviet academy of sciences also 
denied any relation between the port call and the gorbachev visit 
there has been no request either from the soviet leader or 
from chinese leaders to visit the ships at that time he said 
primakov and other soviet speakers at a news conference 
emphasized the importance of sinosoviet rapprochement 
this is not just another visit in the framework of times but 
of historic necessity primakov said 
we are two socialist states faced with major challenges our 
rapprochement will in one way or another make it easier to clarify 
our difficulties

the soviet submarine accident off norway last 
month was a product of the cold war and a scientific tragedy 
reminiscent of the challenger space shuttle disaster pravda said 
today 
the official communist party newspaper said the accident which 
left 42 dead showed once again that the cold war carried down 
into the oceans depths devours not only billions of dollars 
rubles pounds and francs but thousands of seamens lives too 
in a separate report the defense ministry newspaper red star 
said a group of ships has been dispatched to the site where the 
submarine sank to locate and inspect it the soviets say they have 
not decided whether to raise the nuclearpowered ship which was 
carrying nucleartipped torpedoes 
soviet officials say the radiation level in the water 
surrounding the site remains normal 
pravda devoted a full page today to the fate of the experimental 
submarine komsomolets which sank april 7 after a fire broke out on 
board 
i would dare to say that the loss of this boat for our country 
means the same thing as the loss of the shuttle challenger for the 
united states wrote correspondent nikolai cherkashin 
the komsomolets was the first hydrocosmic orbital station so 
to speak it carried torpedoes only because there was no getting 
away from the ongoing naval confrontation pravda said adding 
that the komsomolets could have been a prototype of a new kind of 
sea transport its crew were actually experimenters 
western defense experts said soon after the submarine sank that 
top scientists probably were on board because of its experimental 
nature 
pravda did not specify what the submarine was working on 
the newspaper said some of the money that will be saved with 
soviet defense cutbacks should go toward perfecting rescue systems 
for sailors 
the pravda article which gave a minutebyminute account of the 
accident described how many of the sailors ended up in fatally 
frigid water without protective gear because they did not believe 
the submarine would sink 
it described how the fire spread from one section of the 
submarine to another and how the crew having emerged to the 
surface of the boat could not believe they would end up in the 
icy water 
they all knew that the solid body of their submarine was the 
most solid in the world it said they all knew that nowhere 
and never do burned submarines sink in a few hours 
but the body of the submarine was shaken by explosions and soon 
sank pravda said 
the fire probably began with a short circuit the government 
newspaper izvestia said soon afterward

a dolphin with a strong maternal 
instinct had to be isolated after she kidnapped a newborn dolphin 
and refused to allow the natural mother near the baby marineland 
officials said 
this is the second time shes done that she wants a baby so 
bad park spokesman bill puckett said thursday liz is the one 
that did the dirty deed 
liz has since been returned to the main dolphin tank following 
the abduction last month officials say the baby dolphin is now old 
enough to fend for itself 
the baby was abducted by liz april 7 after a dolphin named betty 
gave birth in a 300000gallon tank that holds marinelands 20 
atlantic bottlenose dolphins 
liz who is believed to about 22 has never had any babies 
puckett said she apparently chooses bettys babies to kidnap 
because betty is much weaker than the other adult females in the 
tank 
when betty has a baby liz goes after it he said 
soon after the dolphin was born liz swam in and pushed the 
30to 40pound baby away from its mother 
just in that minute or two liz just swept right in there 
betty tried to get the baby back puckett said 
but liz stayed between betty and the baby 
officials worried that the baby would starve if it could not get 
milk from its mother that happened two years ago when liz 
kidnapped another of bettys babies and the young dolphin died 13 
days later 
officials drained most of the 12footdeep tank scooped liz 
into a sling and put her in a flume behind a gate 
she stood right by the gate the whole time and pined for the 
baby puckett said 
marineland officials returned liz to the dolphin tank last week 
and they believe the young dolphin has bonded with its mother and 
is strong enough to fend off liz 
we didnt see any ill effects at all i think she liz has 
learned her lesson puckett said

neighborhood of gaza city one in the rimal neighborhood of gaza 
city one in the nusseirat refugee camp and one in el bireh near 
ramallah on the west bank arab reports said 
the army said it was checking the reports 
akraas death raised to at least 472 the number of palestinians 
killed since the palestinian uprising began in december 1987 
twentyone israelis have died 
the clashes occurred in gaza despite a curfew that confined the 
strips nearly 700000 residents to their homes for a fifth 
consecutive day 
also today israelis continued antiarab violence in the coastal 
city of ashdod the hometown of sgt avi sassportaz an israeli

bruises at tulkarem hospital yamani told doctors that his car was 
stoned by soldiers driving by in an army truck near the tulkarem 
refugee camp 
the army said it had no report of the incident 
prime minister yitzhak shamir and his cabinet plan to meet 
sunday to set up guidelines for elections in the territories 
shamir has proposed elections to choose palestinian 
representatives who would negotiate with israel on a period of 
limited autonomy talks would follow three years later on a 
permanent settlement 
when it meets on sunday the 25member administration likely 
will sidestep controversial issues such as international 
supervision and the participation of palestinians from outside the 
territories in the elections 
what we are bringing are the main principles the skeleton of 
the plan without getting into details said a shamir aide who 
spoke today on condition of anonymity 
ministers of shamirs rightwing likud bloc are expected to 
approve the elections idea saturday night shamirs spokesman 
yossi ahimeir said maybe one or two will oppose but the 
majority support it he said 
among the opponents is ariel sharon the trade and industry 
minister who has argued such elections would lead to a palestinian 
state and be a calamity for israel 
ministers of the leftleaning labor party in the coalition 
government approved the plan thursday with only two ministers 
stating opposition 
once the plan is approved it is to be conveyed to dennis ross 
an aide to secretary of state james baker iii ross arrives 
saturday to meet with prominent palestinians and brief israeli 
leaders on bakers talks in moscow with soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze 
ross is expected to try to make the election plan more 
attractive to palestinians by urging israelis to allow 
participation of 140000 east jerusalem residents a concept that 
has been opposed by shamir 
the jerusalem post said that in a letter to foreign minister 
moshem arens 12 days ago baker called for palestinians abroad to 
also be allowed to participate 
the post said the participation of outside palestinians is 
rejected by israeli officials who fear it would be tantamount to 
involving the palestine liberation organization which the 
government views as a terror group bent on israels destruction

the state commission on judicial conduct has made 
public allegations against a state judge who enraged gay activists 
and civil rights groups with his remarks about homosexuals 
after a court hearing thursday lawyers for district judge jack 
hampton and the commission said they had agreed to release the 
contents of formal proceedings sparked by more than 2000 
complaints against the judge 
the allegations cite comments hampton made in december to the 
dallas times herald and the associated press and remarks court 
personnel in hamptons office allegedly made to callers protesting 
the judges statements 
hampton told the newspaper he gave a lighter sentence to 
convicted killer richard bednarski 18 partly because his two 
victims were queers 
the commission charges allege that hamptons remarks violated 
the code of judicial conduct which prohibits a judge from publicly 
commenting on a pending case hampton also is charged with 
violating the code that requires a judge to conduct himself in a 
manner that promotes public confidence in the impartiality of the 
judiciary 
the hearing thursday was before special master robert murray a 
retired judge from san antonio appointed to handle the case 
hampton was not present 
bednarski was convicted of killing tommy trimble 34 and john 
griffin 27 and was sentenced to 30 years in prison he could have 
received a maximum life sentence 
i dont care much for queers cruising the streets picking up 
teenage boys hampton told the times herald ive got a 
teenage boy 
the same day that was published he told ap network news the 
victims were homosexuals they were out in the homosexual area 
picking up teenage boys had they not been out there trying to 
spread aids around theyd still be alive today 
the allegations also refer to citizens who called hamptons 
office to protest his remarks the callers were referred to a 
dallas attorneys office and told to have a gay christmas the 
commission alleges 
that response commission documents state was cavalier 
disdainful and undignified 
the commission announced in february its decision to initiate 
formal proceedings against hampton 
murray will report to the 11member commission then the panel 
could dismiss the complaint issue a public censure or recommend 
the judges removal

a cheyennearapaho woman choking back tears 
told a senate committee today she lost her home and children 
because her royalties from federally managed oil wells stopped 
without explanation 
mary limpy speaking before a special investigating committee of 
the senate select committee on indian affairs said she is living 
in an abandoned house in oklahoma city okla and lost custody of 
her two youngest children because she could not pay her bills 
the checks were small but she used them to support her family 
said mrs limpy who is disabled from polio and ineligible for 
welfare programs as long as she is on the oil royality rolls 
her three wells are managed by the bureau of indian affairs but 
when she went to the agency to find out why her checks stopped 
they could not help her she told the committee 
mrs limpy is part of a federal classaction lawsuit charging 
that the government is not living up to its trust responsibilities 
to indians with oil well interests said attorney steve moore 
that lawsuit has been held under advisement of the judge for two 
and a half years moore said 
on thursday sen dennis deconcini dariz chairman of the 
special committee announced that the navajo indian nation may be 
owed as much as 5 million in back taxes from companies that have 
purchased oil from its property 
the committee discovered the tax error during its investigation 
of oil theft and royalties underpayment by companies doing business 
on indian land 
deconcini said it appears taxes owed the navajos have been 
miscalculated for eight years 
let me make clear that we have found no evidence that the oil 
companies themselves intentionally misstated the amount of taxes 
paid or even that the oil companies were the source of the 
possible misinformation deconcini said 
he said the committee alerted the tribe and will assist it in 
making the correction needed to collect the money and ensure the 
problem isnt repeated 
deconcinis announcement which came on the third day of 
hearings about indian oil hinted at the extent of confusion over 
royalty and tax payments 
accounting errors are rampant in the industry said randy 
fetterolf an oil and gas expert working as a consultant to the 
committee companies are so busy finding producing and selling oil 
that they dont have time to perform the intricate but necessary 
accounting procedures he said 
fetterolf called the oil industry a boom and bust business 
and said many companies that failed to pay royalties are now 
bankrupt 
deconcini and committee member sen john mccain rariz have 
been highly critical of the three agencies charged with protecting 
indian oil rights the bureau of indian affairs the bureau of 
land management and the minerals management service 
chuck norman a committee investigator said thursday that the 
minerals management service was a model of efficiency compared 
to the other two agencies 
however he said the service fails to catch improper valuation 
of oil and improper deductions that companies make from the 
royalties they are supposed to pay 
norman said unlike the irs the minerals service doesnt have 
any builtin signals to alert it to illegal deductions 
he says companies are allowed to deduct some expenses from 
royalties but evidence exists that the privilege may be abused 
furthermore said norman there is a very serious problem with 
the mms penalty system 
he said in the last seven years the service imposed 35 
penalties on indian and nonindian public land but only collected 
five none of which were on indian land 
norman said that because of a loophole in the law companies 
that fail to pay their penalties escape unscathed 
earlier in the day witnesses from the southern ute tribe in 
colorado described how they took over management of their oil wells 
because of the federal governments failure to do the job 
tom shipps attorney for the southern utes told the committee 
he didnt trust the minerals service to effectively police royalty 
payments his tribe uses its own accountants to audit oil 
transactions 
norman praised the work of the southern utes 
what needs to be encouraged is more autonomy for the indians 
like the southern utes said norman

a dutch soldiers union on friday 
called for the government to cut the draft time by onequarter 
citing inefficiency and boredom 
the government however wont consider such a move because of 
nato commitments on military training and personnel strength said 
defense ministry spokesman hans schonau 
the draft period for lower ranks could be cut from 14 to 10 
months because at least 25 percent of a conscripts time is 
squandered said union spokesman frans vergouwe 
concripts make up 49000 of the netherlands 65000member armed 
forces 
a union poll of 408 drafted men showed 56 percent thought they 
worked inefficiently thirty percent said they routinely completed 
their days work in four hours instead of the regulation eight 
vergouwe said 
more efficient use of time would allow for shorter army stints

thanks to an invitation to dinner at a restaurant 
construction worker jaime polomo got to meet his sons firstgrade 
teacher and tell her why he had not gone to school for conferences 
this year 
i work all day he said at night i study english 
polomo his wife valentine their son jaime and teacher jean 
smithandrade had dinner courtesy of local businessman phil garvin 
who has sponsored more than 100 such teacherparent dinners 
garvin gave jose valdez elementary school 10000 from his 
television production company norac productions inc to encourage 
the six firstgrade teachers to take their students and the 
students parents out to dinner 
we wanted to start this the first year that kids have homework 
so we can set in motion hopefully for the rest of their lives 
this communication between teachers and parents he said 
sevenyearold jaime said his firstgrade classmates all were 
talking about these teacherparent dinners and he was excited 
garvin said that enthusiasm and the occasion is what his 
investment is all about 
thats it if the exciting thing of the year can be a meeting 
with the teacher thats it education is important said garvin 
the dinners are meant to be a special occasion that sends 
a clear message to the parents hey you can make a difference 
garvin said 
mrs polomo who had met the teacher a few times before said 
the dinner provided time to talk when you go to school you have 
about 15 minutes to talk with the teacher and thats all 
garvin lives in the comfortable suburb of englewood but does 
business a few blocks from the school north of downtown denver he 
said he wanted to put something back into the poor largely 
hispanic neighborhood where teachers say about 60 percent of 
firstgraders speak spanish at home 
garvin said he was disturbed by news reports in recent years of 
a decline in the quality of american public education 
i was reading all these studies that say that the big 
difference between a successful school and an unsuccessful school 
is parental involvement he said 
he said his interest in helping education was inspired partly by 
the example of new york city businessman eugene lang who pays for 
college for students who graduate from the harlem high school lang 
attended he said he also was moved by the movie stand and 
deliver about los angeles superteacher jaime escalante 
when garvin suggested his dinner plan to valdez officials last 
christmas his business already had been giving 10000 a year for 
the past three years to nearby north high school to reward good 
teaching under that program five teachers receive 2000 grants 
each 
the dinners generally have drawn rave reviews 
some parents said it was the first time they had eaten in a 
sitdown restaurant 
teacher josie garcia who has 16 students and was able to 
arrange 15 dinners said that at one of her dinners the students 
father worked in the restaurant kitchen and got time off to come 
out for the occasion 
we found out how hard the parents work said teacher amy 
pleasantphillips we sort of knew it but werent aware quite 
how hard they work how much of their time is spent paying the 
rent 
it gave us a realistic picture of where the priorities are 
said garcia most parents are very involved with their children 
but its very hard for them to find time to help them with school 
teachers said they talked to parents at dinner about the 
importance of education and ways parents can help their children 
from making sure they have a place to do homework to reading with 
them for even 10 minutes a night 
said smithandrade we tell them that attitude is an important 
part a parent doesnt need to take much time just show they 
care 
she said many parents in the area are recent immigrants and 
many are dropouts such parents tend to be intimidated by teachers 
and school authorities 
a restaurant is neutral ground she said 
for the children the dinners are events one child wore an 
easter bonnet and others talked for days about what they would 
wear and what they would order to eat teachers said 
when asked what they enjoyed most about the dinner a group of 
five children answered unanimously ice cream

a federal judge today accepted a 
reported 100 million settlement of lawsuits stemming from the 1986 
dupont plaza hotel fire that killed 97 people on new years eve 
us district court judge raymond l acosta did not disclose the 
amount of the settlement but said he was generally satisfied 
with it 
agreement in the case involving about 2300 plaintiffs from 
across the country seeking damages from at least 200 defendants 
was reached tuesday and approved thursday night by district judge 
louis c bechtle in philadelphia 
us supreme court chief justice william rehnquist had appointed 
bechtle to head the negotiations bechtle was the presiding judge 
in a similarly complex case for the 1980 mgm grand hotel fire in 
las vegas that left 84 people dead the settlement in that case 
totalled 200 million 
an envelope with the settlement was handed to acosta on 
wednesday 
plaintiffs in the case tried in us district court in san 
juan had sought damages of 18 billion 
a former hotel maintenance worker pleaded guilty to setting the 
dupont plaza fire during a labor dispute at the 22story hotel 
which was packed with almost 1000 tourists about 140 people were 
injured 
the hotel was cited for 25 violations by the occupational safety 
and health administration including lack of emergency exits from 
the casino where 84 of the victims died 
under the agreement signed in philadelphia 50 million will be 
paid by the insurer american international underwriters corp and 
35 million by the socalled dupontfamily group of partnerships 
and individuals who owned many hotel enterprises including the 
dupont plaza other insurance carriers will pay the remaining 15 
million 
the settlement halted a complex trial in san juan that focused 
on who owns the hotel and who is liable for damages 
acosta said the agreement was fully binding on all parties 
but contingent on certain unspecified conditions being met within 
60 days he said the jury will be recalled july 14 to learn whether 
those conditions have been met and whether the trial should move on 
in the meantime acosta issued a 60day stay against all claims 
in the case

more than 200 people were out of their 
homes today after a midsouth railroad train derailed and spilled 
thousands of gallons of antifreeze and diesel fuel into the chunky 
river authorities said 
no injuries were reported in the derailment which occurred 
about 830 pm thursday 10 miles west of here but officials said 
the chemicals and diesel fuel that leaked near and into the river 
created a pollution hazard booms were placed downriver from the 
spill site to catch leaking fuel 
the evacuees who included 22 nursing home patients and about 
200 other people may have to stay away from their homes until 
sunday authorities said 
we now estimate that 20000 to 25000 gallons of ethylene 
glycol alcohol antifreeze got into the river along with 3000 
to 5000 gallons of diesel fuel said eleana turner spokeswoman 
for the mississippi bureau of pollution control 
investigators did not know what caused the derailment which 
involved 12 cars and three engines two of the engines fell into 
the river which runs parallel to the railroad tracks 
we have directed a precautionary evacuation in a onemile 
radius around the derailment site said jim maher director of 
the mississippi emergency management agency 
six of the derailed cars carried the ethylene glycol alcohol or 
antifreeze at least three leaked but it was believed that only 
one of the three spilled a significant amount of the chemical said 
dusty perkins a spokesman for the mississippi emergency management 
agency 
authorities told people downstream from the derailment to stay 
away from the river and keep livestock away from it because 
drinking high concentrations of antifreeze can be fatal the booms 
set up to contain the diesel fuel would not stop the antifreeze 
perkins said but the water would eventually dilute it 
our concern now is a pollution concern rather than a public 
safety concern perkins said nobody is going to breathe any 
toxic fumes from this and die but we dont know what will happen 
to the river 
a car containing about 20000 gallons of sodium hydroxide a 
powder also called caustic soda that is used in a variety of 
industries spilled right next to the river 
perkins said first reports indicated some of the caustic soda 
had entered the river but we have a correction from the scene 
that it has been contained and did not get into the chunky 
sandy metrolis of the lauderdale county emergency management 
agency said some people on the scene complained of burning eyes and 
a strong odor but as far as the effect on the river i dont 
know she said 
four derailed cars carried vinyl chloride but they werent 
leaking while the 12th derailed car had plastic beads that would 
be hazardous only if burned 
perkins said that the federal environmental protection agency 
was bringing in sampling equipment to determine the spills effect 
on the river 
lauderdale county deputy david taylor said a community center in 
meridien was set up as a shelter for the 200 people who live within 
a mile of the derailment site

christian and moslem sectors friday to try to settle a dispute over 
the terms of a ceasefire and keep the rivals from rekindling their 
war 
the arab leagues latest truce the fifth in more than two 
months of fighting was tested by minor shelling fired from syrian 
positions at the coast of the christian enclave north of the city 
a police spokesman said the shelling was a clear message that 
the syrians would not allow any ship carrying iraqi weapons to dock 
at ports in the enclave 
syria accuses iraq of aiding the christian forces 
the police spokesman said syrian gunners fired six rockets at 
the christian coastline north of beirut the 122mm grad rockets 
exploded in several locations of the coast causing damage but 
no casualties said the spokesman

conflicting demands about the deployment of the 321member arab

the other by aoun said one source they are concentrating 
their talks on a compromise plan accepted by all the parties 
the syrianproposed plan the source said calls for deploying 
the observers at ports in the christian enclave to try to prevent 
ships carrying iraqi weapons and ammunition from resupplying 
aouns forces 
aoun in a counterproposal called for their deployment along 
lebanons extensive border with syria and at the syriancontrolled 
beirut airport in the citys moslem sector to monitor the 
syrians moves the source said 
iraq syrias main arab foe supports aouns declared war of 
liberation to drive syrias 40000 troops out of lebanon

sen alan cranston accused 
ambassadordesignate donald gregg today of deliberately misleading 
congress and perhaps lying under oath about his involvement in the 
illegal resupply of the contra rebels while serving as intelligence 
chief to thenvice president george bush 
leveling a barrage of accusations against gregg cranston 
dcalif said an intensive investigation and an examination of 
documents submitted during the trial of oliver l north leads him 
to believe that gregg sponsored a freelance covert operation out 
of the vice presidents office to illegally resupply the contras 
in their fight against the leftist government in nicaragua 
gregg said cranstons characterization based on greggs 
friendship with former cia operative felix rodriguez was 
inaccurate 
i think it is a rather fullblown example of a conspiracy 
theory gregg said of cranstons comments thats not what i 
was doing it is not what felix was doing to my knowledge my job 
was to keep the vice president informed i did not have operational 
responsibility for anything to do that would have been the 
quickest way for me to lose my job 
gregg said bush made it clear that greggs job was sitting 
and listening and reporting he said he did not learn until 
august 1986 that rodriguez was involved in assisting the contra 
military resupply operation and that he didnt learn until december 
1986 that north had recruited rodriguez in september 1985 to assist 
that effort gregg said he thought rodriguez efforts were focused 
on assisting the salvadoran military combat guerrillas 
cranston told the senate foreign relations committee that the 
investigation has raised so many questions about greggs 
credibility and truthfulness that many senators believe he is not 
qualified to become us ambassador to south korea the post to 
which president bush has nominated him 
north during his trial contradicted the sworn testimony of 
gregg who says he didnt find out until august 1986 that north was 
assisting the contras 
cranston asked why senators who it appears that you have 
systematically misled should now be asked to reward your actions 
and entrust you with the position of ambassador of the united 
states 
cranston said that he asked secretary of state james a baker 
iii weeks ago to withdraw the gregg nomination so an airing of 
allegations against the nominee would not be necessary 
since this nomination is now before us we must now endeavor to 
make clear whether you mr gregg have played any part in 
deliberate efforts to deceive the congress cranston said 
in his lengthy opening statement cranston said he is now 
prepared to expand the investigation to include greggs other 
activities while working as a national security adviser in bushs 
vice presidential office 
he said these include greggs activities relating to honduras 
panama and the secret us arms sales to iran 
if we are obliged to we will explore all of these and 
consider calling other witnesses to obtain sworn evidence 
cranston said 
gregg in a 21page prepared opening statement made no 
reference to any of the issues raised by cranston and spoke only 
about us relations with south korea 
cranston challenged greggs previous congressional testimony 
that prior to the revelation of the secret arms sales to iran and 
the diversion of a portion of the profits to the contras in 
nicaragua in november 1986 you and the vice president had never 
discussed the contras we had no responsibility for it we had no 
expertise in it 
he said gregg a 30year veteran of the central intelligence 
agency had also told a us district court that he had no 
respoonsibility to bush for central american issues 
yet the committee is now in receipt of memos under your name 
which indicate that your involvement in the promotion of central 
american activities did not in fact end when you joined the vice 
presidents staff cranston said 
 
four months after joining the bush staff cranston said gregg 
gave enthusiastic written support for a 1982 proposal by 
rodriguez to conduct helicopter strikes against a wide range of 
central american targets 
on sept 19 1984 cranston said gregg wrote a memo briefing 
bush on sources of contra resupply 
in april 1986 he said gregg wrote a memo setting up a meeting 
for rodriguez to brief bush on the status of the war in el 
salvador and resupply of the contras 
cranston noted that 18 months earlier the boland amendment 
barring certain us personnel from any involvement in military 
resupply of the contras had gone into effect 
cranston ticked off memo after memo all of which he said 
indicate gregg played a far greater role in central american 
activities than he has publicly acknowledged 
we could go on to explore the other glaring contradictions in 
your sworn testimony and we will cranston said 
but at a certain point your repeated denials and professions 
of ignorance take upon themselves a certain the dog ate my 
homework refrain the senator said

will march to tiananmen square on saturday to begin the hunger 
strike they pledged to remain there until authorities agree to 
sincere dialogue on their demands 
gorbachev is to arrive monday for the first sinosoviet summit 
in 30 years 
at beijing university students crowded around a table in a 
dormitory hall to sign up for the hunger strike

activist at nearby beijing normal college well strike to the 
end 
hundreds of students gathered at the campus center late into the 
night to listen to colleagues pledge support for the hunger strike 
students have marched from their schools to tiananmen square 
seven times since protests for freedom and democracy broke out a 
month ago 
government spokesman yuan mu said he hopes students will not 
disrupt the gorbachev summit 
im sure that the overwhelming majority of the students will 
proceed from the standpoint of maintaining the political and social 
stability in china and act to protect the international prestige of 
china yuan said 
students at beijing university by thursday night gathered 1200 
signatures for an open invitation to gorbachev to speak at chinas 
most prestigious university 
yuan said if the students do march i think that the correct 
policies and approaches adopted by the chinese government recently 
will be continued to be pursued 
yuan said the government is discussing a proposed law on public 
protests 
yuan said details of the law have yet to be worked out but 
that law will be designed to both protect the exercise of civil 
rights of citizens and at the same time protect social and state 
interests 
the government has acted with restraint after threatening a 
crackdown and mobilizing troops early in the campaign there has 
been no serious attempt to stop the demonstrations and the 
government has agreed to meet selected students to discuss such 
issues as freedom of the press and official corruption 
activists however accuse the government of stalling in 
responding to their demands that new independently elected student 
groups be recognized and be given a voice in the dialogue 
in a frontpage editorial the peoples daily mouthpiece of the 
communist party also appealed friday for calm and stability but 
acknowledged complaints by students are real 
more and more people have realized that there are problems 
existing in our country including the problems raised by students 
these problems can only be solved under circumstances of stability 
and on the track of democracy and law it said 
also friday a newspaper said politburo member hu qili met with 
reporters from the china youth news many of whom have been active 
in a journalists movement for freedom of the press 
the china youth news reported that hu responsible for 
supervising chinas staterun media talked with the journalists 
thursday in a cordial harmonious and friendly atmosphere 
it said hu listened to their opinions but it gave no details 
about his reply 
earlier this week chinese journalists gave the government a 
petition signed by more than 1000 reporters requesting a dialogue 
on censorship

the nato allies today welcomed in 
guarded terms soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs plan to 
unilaterally cut 500 shortrange nuclear weapons and called on 
moscow not to stop there 
we consider reduction in 500 weapons alone as a welcome 
positive but rather modest step nato said in a statement after 
us secretary of state james a baker iii discussed his trip to 
moscow this week with senior officials of the 15 other nato nations 
nato already has removed 2400 nuclear arms in the past decade 
the statement said 
our levels are much lower than those of the soviet union it 
said and added that nato looks to moscow to make further 
reductions in its unwarranted superiority 
nato estimates the soviet union has 1450 shortrange nuclear 
missile launchers in europe against 88 for the western alliance 
national security adviser brent scowcroft traveling with 
president bush to texas took a harder approach to gorbachevs 
plan he told reporters he thought it is designed principally to 
create problems within the alliance divisions within the 
western alliance 
baker discussed with the allies a new challenge by gorbachev to 
cut not only shortrange nuclear weapons but tanks troops and 
aircraft in europe as well 
the nato meeting was attended by seven foreign ministers 
including baker and west germanys hansdietrich genscher and 
senior officials of the 16 nato nations 
the soviet offer to cut 500 shortrange nuclear weapons comes at 
a time when nato is buffeted by an internal dispute over whether to 
modernize its 88 lance missiles the issue is expected to dominate 
a may 2930 nato summit here 
baker met separately here with genscher who wants nato to delay 
the modernization of the lance missiles until the early 1990s and 
begin talks on reducing shortrange nuclear arms with the soviet 
union 
at the outset of their session at nato headquarters a reporter 
asked baker if he planned to bury the hatchet with genscher 
there is no hatchet replied baker 
baker was also met separately with dutch foreign minister hans 
van den broek whose country is one of several nato members trying 
to mediate in the modernization debate that has pitted britain and 
the united states against west germany and several other allies 
the secretary of state at a news conference acknowledged he was 
unable to persuade west germany to back off its demands for us 
negotiations with the soviet union to reduce nuclear missiles in 
europe after meeting with genscher baker said he still was 
hopeful for a settlement before the meeting later this month 
it has not as yet been resolved baker said 
many of the 16 allies are lined up with west germany while the 
united states has the strong support of britain and a handful of 
others the germans also are balking at usefforts to more than 
triple the range of the shortrange us lance nuclear missiles 
most of which are based on german soil 
it is a very very important issue involving as it does 
questions of alliance security baker said 
after a full exchange on the issue baker said he hoped 
genscher better understands our position 
on another sensitive issue there was apparent nato unity as 
baker briefed seven foreign ministers and other western officials 
on his talks with gorbachev the secretary of state said the soviet 
proposal to withdraw 500 battlefield nuclear weapons was 
apparently designed for public opinion and had not guaranteed 
the weapons would be destroyed 
baker told gorbachev at their meeting in the kremlin this week 
he opposes talks on shortrange nuclear weapons saying the warsaw 
pact was so far ahead in tactical nuclear weapons the united states 
could not even consider negotiations until there was a little 
less of an imbalance 
the unilateral cuts gorbachev intends to make this year include 
284 shortrange missiles 166 nuclear bombs carried by airplanes 
and 50 nuclear artillery shells 
in moscow gorbachev also moved boldly on the conventional 
weapons front telling baker he would offer to cut warsaw pact tanks 
by 40000 combat aircraft by 42000 and artillery pieces by 
47000 a us official said 
other elements of the plan include a reduction of 1 million 
troops in both alliances and a 55 percent reduction in natos 
combat aircraft 
by 1997 the official said gorbachev is aiming for equal levels 
of 135 million troops in the two alliances 1500 strike aircraft 
and 20000 tanks 
the ceilings in other areas would be 1700 helicopters 24000 
artillery pieces and 28000 combat vehicles 
baker declined to evaluate the proposal but the us official 
said he had told gorbachev that it would be up to the nato alliance 
to reply

with nato trying to settle a sharp internal 
dispute and his trip to west germany a month away mikhail s 
gorbachev is trying to seize the initiative in europe by offering a 
unilateral cut in tactical nuclear weapons 
the soviet president made his move as the bush administration 
emerged from a 3month foreign policy review that has delayed 
superpower arms talks 
us officials said gorbachevs plan to cut 500 warheads this 
year was not surprising and insufficient to make up for an 
overwhelming warsaw pact superiority in tactical weapons and they 
said his plans to cut conventional weapons and forces follow some 
north atlantic treaty organization proposals 
but the timing and the content of his proposal was plainly cast 
to put gorbachev already popular in europe in the role of an 
initiator of new ideas in what he calls our common european 
home as nato squabbles over its policies 
on friday secretary of state james a baker iii met with nato 
allies seeking to smooth differences over plans to modernize its 
tactical missiles 
such modernization is a matter of special concern not only for 
the soviet union not only for eastern europe but also for europe 
as a whole for it applies to a huge part of europe and justifiably 
concerns the public all europeans gorbachev told baker in talks 
thursday modernization calls in question the us intentions 
a senior us official said this is an emotional political 
issue in the west they know that and in part they are playing on 
that its an issue in germany and gorbachev is going to germany 
next month 
gorbachevs move followed a series of arms control proposals he 
put forward in the last two years that made him appear more dynamic 
than president ronald reagan in london last month gorbachev tried 
to keep that momentum by announcing soviet cuts in the production 
of radioactive materials for nuclear weapons 
but western officials said the soviets already had a sufficient 
stockpile of weaponsgrade uranium 
the unilateral cut of 284 shortrange missiles 166 nuclear 
bombs and 50 nuclear artillery shells was announced only after 
baker had held a news conference and left moscow without referring 
to it 
but the us official in moscow who spoke on condition he not 
further be identified bristled at a suggestion the united states 
had been caught off guard by gorbachevs proposal and did not know 
how to react 
we were quite aware we could expect further unilateral 
moves he said 
he said officials did not know whether the offer would occur 
bakers visit or during gorbachevs trip to west germany june 1215 
most of the nato force of lance missiles is located in west 
germany making it the linchpin in the dispute over tactical 
weapons chancellor helmut kohl has called for immediate 
negotiations on tactical weapons which the bush administration 
opposes until the soviet union reduces its estimated 121 
superiority 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze traveled to west germany 
on friday the day after the soviet proposal was made to prepare 
for gorbachevs trip 
tass in a report on shevardnadzes visit praised kohls stand 
for getting a positive response in europe as has bonns 
readiness for talks on reducing this class of armaments 
the soviet news agency said soviet diplomats view relations with 
west germany not only within a bilateral but also within an 
alleuropean context and even in a broader world context 
most nato allies have lined up behind kohl britain strongly 
supports the united states and canada and norway are said to be 
working behind the scenes for a compromise 
after leaving moscow baker described gorbachevs offer as a 
good step but a small step the move affects about 5 percent 
of an estimated 10000 battlefield nuclear weapons 
gorbachev called for a ceiling of 135 million soldiers for both 
the warsaw pact and nato to be met by 199697 and for limits on 
combat aircraft tanks and armored vehicles 
he proposed that both sides nuclear arsenals in europe be 
eliminated entirely by 1991 
the united states says nuclear weapons are essential to keeping 
the peace in europe 
according to tass gorbachev told baker that such arguments are 
unconvincing because the soviet union was proposing parallel 
reductions in coventional forces which would elminate the need for 
a nuclear response to a warsaw pact attack

an executive with the easter seal society 
who says he was barred from a commuter flight because of his 
batterypowered wheelchair is suing the airlines involved and 
tampa international airport 
dennis j celorie chief executive officer for the 
sarasotabased easter seal society of southwest florida filed the 
2 million lawsuit thursday naming delta air lines and its feeder 
line comair inc 
he claims comair wouldnt let him board a march 17 flight to 
tallahassee because it was against airline policy to transport 
batterypowered wheelchairs he was on his way to a state labor 
department advisory committee meeting 
celorie 50 has cerebral palsy and has used a powered 
wheelchair since college airlines used to worry that battery acid 
might spill onto luggage he said but new chairs use sealed gel 
batteries designed for air travel and approved by federal 
regulators 
his travel agency told comair about the wheelchair when 
reservations were made two weeks in advance he said but when 
celorie tried to board an attendant refused to let him on the 
19seater according to the lawsuit 
celorie is seeking more than 1 million in compensatory damages 
saying the incident hurt his sensibilities and left him with 
feelings of powerlessness and exclusion he also wants 1 
million in punitive damages and an injunction prohibiting the 
airlines from banning passengers with similar wheelchairs 
officials at comairs headquarters in cincinnati ohio said 
they were not aware of the suit and could not comment delta 
spokeswoman jackie pate said the carrier did nothing wrong in the 
incident 
delta owns 20 percent of comair one of a number of commuter 
airlines that coordinates schedules with delta to provide air 
service to smaller cities 
celorie sued the airport because it leases space and landing 
rights to the two airlines i really didnt want to sue 
celorie said i just wanted to change the policy

robert mcc adams secretary of the 
smithsonian institution objected friday to parts of proposed 
legislation concerning the building here of a national museum of 
the american indian complaining mainly about a provision involving 
consultations on remains 
while we are heartened by many provisions of the proposed 
bill we must register objections to others adams said in 
testimony prepared for a joint hearing of the senate select 
committee on indian affairs and the rules committee 
primary among these is the requirement that the smithsonian 
board of regents consult with the board of trustees of the new 
museum on the matter of skeletal remains 
on monday adams signed a memorandum of understanding with the 
museum of the american indian in new york city to transfer the 
worlds largest collection of american indian artifacts to the 
smithsonian 
the museum would display objects from the heye foundation 
collection of more than a million artifacts 
the smithsonian already has indian artifacts including some 
34000 skeletal specimens almost all of which were acquired 
through archaelogical excavations or salvage operations 
approximately 14500 of the remains are north american indians 
and some tribes have sought return of these bones for burial the 
museum has said it would return any bones which tribes could 
identify as being those of their ancestors but few tribes have made 
claims 
the collections at issue are under the purview of an entirely 
separate museum adams said in testimony friday while 
individual trustees may be consulted in a personal capacity the 
requirement for consultation with the board as a body is not 
appropriate 
adams also objected to a requirement in the bill that seven 
members of the board of trustees of the new museum must be of 
native american ancestry 
our agreement with the museum of the american indian heye 
foundation which must be approved by the courts in new york 
includes no comparable requirement although it clearly 
contemplates that american indians and alaska natives will be 
members of the board he said in prepared remarks

a government body voted friday to pull 
out of a controversial danube river dam project it said is a 
symbol of hungarys mismanaged economic development the official 
news agency reported 
the decision came in the form of a proposal by an advisory body 
of the council of ministers but it serves as a strong indication 
the government and communist party leadership will scrap the 
project 
this will delight environmentalists who have said the nagymaros 
dam scheme will destroy wetlands and their unique wildlife and 
probably will anger czecholovakia which already has spent 11 
billion on a companion project 
the council of economists lawyers and other experts rejected 
the idea of putting the project to a public vote as suggested in a 
petition signed by 140000 hungarians the mti news agency said 
the body has stated categorically that no referendum should be 
held on the matter it reported in these complex questions of 
engineering economy and international law responsibility must not 
be passed on to hungarys citizens 
the multimilliondollar project to build dams and power stations 
at nagymaros 30 miles upstream from budapest and at gabcikovo in 
czechoslovakia was drawn up a decade ago with the intent of 
boosting electrical power for both communist nations and making the 
danube more navigable 
hungarian premier miklos nemeth told reporters earlier this week 
that the project stood a 5050 chance of being scrapped because it 
has become a symbol of a longoutdated economic model 
czechoslovakias investment in gabcikovo 40 miles east of 
bratislava may never be properly realized as experts say the 
projects are too interrelated for the gabcikovo dam to be fully 
effective without construction of the nagymaros segment 
mti said the advisory council believes that certain 
controversial issues are bound to occur even between friendly or 
allied states 
but the state agency said it expected no damage to relations 
between budapest and prague unless someone were to abuse the 
termination of the project for this purpose 
it quoted the government council as saying the project was 
misguided and badly handled all around 
terminating the project would not bring about an adequate 
situation either but this was the only alternative for the 
country mti concluded 
the agency said there was only one dissenting vote in the 
council but it did not say how many people serve on it

dudley haines first mistake leaving 
his door ajar when he went fishing was spotted by a neighbor who 
told police there might be a burglar inside his second police 
allege was growing marijuana in his closet 
a state appeal court ruled thursday that prosecutors can use 
those plants in a drug possession case against haines the panel 
overruled a lower court 
the closet was sufficiently large to have provided a hiding 
place for a possible burglar wrote winifred sharp chief judge 
of the 5th district court of appeal the fact that the police 
discovered cannabis in plain view in a place they were entitled to 
search for an intruder was bad luck for haines but it does not 
invalidate their search and discovery 
haines 26 a supermarket produce clerk who now again faces a 
felony drug charge went fishing on march 5 1988 
lawrence moore haines neighbor noticed the open door at 8 
pm and seeing no light on called police to report a possible 
burglary according to court documents 
i dont think he had anything bad in mind haines said of 
moore he was just looking out for my interests in his own way 
police said that when they pulled aside a curtain in the hall 
they discovered a closet containing a plant light and a terrarium 
holding six marijuana plants 
haines was arrested as soon as he came back from his fishing 
trip he said the plants were for his personal use not 
distribution 
authorities said the charge against haines possession of more 
than 20 grams of cannabis is punishable by as much as five years 
in prison but that since he has no prior convictions a jail 
sentence would be unlikely

more than 160 people have died in the 
past two weeks from dehydration diarrhea and other effects of a 
deadly drought newspapers reported friday 
temperatures hovered at 102 on friday and the health ministry 
warned that citizens should drink more water and mix it with salt 
to fend off dehydration it also cautioned against drinking unsafe 
water the cause of the diarrhea outbreak 
the government has given no statistics for droughtrelated 
deaths but the stateowned bangladesh times said 100 people in the 
northern droughthit regions had died of diarrhea in the past two 
weeks it quoted local health officials as recording 3000 cases of 
people seeking treatment for diarrhea 
the newspaper banglar bani said 45 people died from the heat in 
the rajshahi rangpur and nilphamari districts of northwestern 
bangladesh in the past 10 days it said 15 others died in the 
neighboring bogra padma and dinajpur districts 
the bengalilanguage daily said crops had withered ponds and 
lakes had dried up and there was not enough groundwater to operate 
pumps 
other newspapers put the heat wave death toll at 30 for the last 
10 days a privately owned news agency united news of bangladesh 
said 20 people died from heat in the last week 
government officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
declined to confirm or deny the death tolls they said people had 
died but they were unable to give numbers because of the remoteness 
of the regions 
the education ministry ordered all schools in the 16 of the 
countrys 64 districts to close until the summer monsoon rains 
arrive to ease the threemonth drought 
earlier this week temperatures reached 107 the governments 
weather office said there appeared to be no chance of rain for at 
least a week 
bangladesh one of the worlds poorest countries with a per 
capita income of only 160 a year alternates between devastating 
drought and innundating floods as well as being buffeted by 
cyclones and tornadoes 
last summer more than 1400 died when monsoonswollen rivers 
flooded fourfifths of the nation another 1100 died in cyclones 
in november 
late last month president hussain muhammad ershad led 
nationwide prayers for rain to ease the current drought for his 110 
million countrymen and women the following day rains came 
accompanied by tornadoes that killed more than 1100 people and 
left 130000 homeless 
the current drought threatens to destroy at least 50 percent of 
the spring grain crops now in the ground the government had 
counted on the the spring harvest to yield 56 million tons of rice 
and wheat about onefourth of the countrys annual needs

the supreme court on friday upheld an 
extradition order for a palestinian wanted by the united states in 
the 1982 bombing of a pan am jetliner 
mohammed rashid had appealed a lower courts decision that 
granted a us request for his extradition washington considers 
the case a test of greeces willingness to fight terrorism 
the court rejects mohammed rashids appeal by majority of 
votes said nikos sakelaropoulos president of the supreme 
courts fivemember criminal division 
the court gave no reason for its decision 
the final say on whether rashid is sent to the united states 
must be made by the minister of justice according to greek law 
it is unlikely that a decision will be made before the june 18 
general elections however and rashid still has time left to serve 
for crimes prosecuted by greek authorities 
even though a final decision is pending a justice department 
spokesman said in washington that the supreme courts ruling was 
significant 
we think this is the biggest hurdle said david runkel an 
aide to us attorney general dick thornburgh 
thornburgh who was returning to washington from madrid where 
he attended a conference on terrorism issued a statement praising 
the greek courts decision 
the courts decision sends a strong signal around the world 
that outright senseless murder cannot be excused under the dubious 
claim of political motivation thornburgh said theres nothing 
political about blowing up innocent civilians in the sky 
rashid 39 is wanted in the united states for the pan am 
bombing over hawaii in which a japanese teenager was killed and 15 
people were injured 
he was arrested in may 1988 at athens airport following a tip by 
the us embassy and was sentenced to seven months in prison for 
holding a false passport he was sentenced to another eight months 
on march 28 for keeping makeshift knives in his prison cell 
the supreme courts decision on rashids appeal had been 
postponed for months on grounds that us authorities had not 
provided enough documents to the greek court 
but us diplomats said they provided the supreme court with all 
the necessary authentic documents 
rashids lawyers had argued that their client is actually 
mohammed hamdan 34 a palestine liberation organization military 
officer not involved in the terrorist acts for which rashid is 
wanted 
spyros fytrakis one of two defense lawyers claimed that 
sending rashid to stand trial in the united states would upset 
greeces foreign policy and the countrys good relations with the 
arab world its obvious the americans have political reasons to 
demand his extradition 
the supreme court convened under heavy security with dozens of 
policemen ringing the building in the city center and sharpshooters 
stationed on nearby roofs judges arrived escorted by police guards 
on april 10 the urban terrorist marxist group may 1 detonated a 
bomb outside the apartment of a supreme court judge and threatened 
to take action against other judges involved in the rashid case 
may 1 has claimed responsibility for the assassination of 
supreme court prosecutor anastasios vernardos in january another 
terrorist group november 17 also claimed the shooting death of a 
magistrate and the wounding of another

but soviet authorities said friday they were not worried that 
gorbachev is to visit shanghai on the same day us warships are to 
pay a port call 
i dont think we should overestimate the importance of the 
port call soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov said 
at least two warships from the us 7th fleet will sail into 
shanghai on thursday when gorbachev will be touring the city on 
his final day in china 
it is only the second port call by navy vessels to communist 
china the first was in 1986 to the yellow sea port of qingdao 
foreign diplomats see the port call as a clear signal by the 
chinese that better relations with the soviet union wont interfere 
with chinas strong ties with the united states 
china has stressed that gorbachevs visit and normalization of 
longstrained relations with the soviet union wont affect its 
relations with other countries 
gorbachev arrives monday for the first sinosoviet summit in 30 
years 
yevgeny m primakov director of the institute of world economic 
and international relations of the soviet academy of sciences also 
denied any relation between the port call and the gorbachev visit 
there has been no request either from the soviet leader or 
from chinese leaders to visit the ships at that time he said 
primakov and other soviet speakers at a news conference 
emphasized the importance of sinosoviet rapprochement 
this is not just another visit in the framework of times but 
of historic necessity primakov said 
we are two socialist states faced with major challenges our 
rapprochement will in one way or another make it easier to clarify 
our difficulties

combat troops moved out today bound for pamama 
from us air bases part of president bushs order to protect 
american lives as the united states mobilizes diplomatic pressure 
to force the ouster of military leader manuel antonio noriega 
the first wave of marine reinforcements from camp lejeune nc 
and army troops from the 7th light infantry division at fort ord 
calif flew to panama as part of the defense departments 
operation dubbed nimrod dancer 
bush reacting to postelection violence announced the 
deployment thursday of 2000 combat troops to panama to augment the 
10000 american service personnel stationed there 
the president also said he was ready to explore ways to entice 
noriega to step down on his own 
diplomatic moves included a meeting today in washington of the 
organization of american states where members of the permanent 
council unanimously approved a venezuelan resolution calling for a 
special meeting wednesday to discuss the panama crisis 
i will do what is necessary to protect the lives of american 
citizens and we will not be intimidated by the bullying tactics 
brutal though they may be of the dictator noriega bush said 
at the same time bushs national security adviser questioned 
both the likelihood of a real confrontation with noriega and the 
efficacy of the presidents action in forcing panamas de facto 
ruler from power 
he is a thug but he clearly operates with some prudence when 
he has to said brent scowcroft the presidents national 
security adviser he called the troop buildup precautionary as 
much as anything else although bush had said in his news 
conference im worried about the lives of american citizens 
scowcroft all but acknowledged that bushs action would do 
little to force noriega from power 
we can always hope he will see the error of his ways and we 
are looking at ways to help convince him to recognize the will of 
the panamanian people scowcroft said 
asked if it would be acceptable for noriega to still be in power 
a month from now scowcroft said i dont see why not 
the deployment of two army battalions one marine company and 
dozens of armored personnel carriers began late thursday and the 
pentagon said it likely will take a week or more to complete 
for 15 months the united states has been frustrated in its 
efforts to force noriega from power following his indictment in 
florida on drugtrafficking charges 
the latest steps containing no new economic sanctions or orders 
for direct military action drew bipartisan praise in a joint 
statement from congressional leaders as measured and deliberate 
steps to assist the panamanian people in restoring democracy to 
panama 
however some lawmakers grumbled bush did not go far enough and 
said tougher action was needed to drive out noriega 
a number of lawmakers had urged bush to invade panama or to 
break the treaty with panama which commits the united states to 
turn over control of the panama canal at the end of the century 
said sen alan cranston dcalif the senates deputy democratic 
leader cranston was among those to support bush 
unlike former president reagan bush said he would not consider 
dropping the drug charges to get noriega to go 
but look i will be openminded about seeing what it might 
take to see him leave bush said in a brief news conference 
short of dropping the drug indictment bush said the door is 
open to understand what it is that would be required 
the president made a direct appeal to latin america in general 
and panamanians in particular to move against noriega in the wake 
of sundays presidential election which was widely denounced as 
fraudulent and was followed by violence 
we would encourage countries in this hemisphere to either 
jointly or personally make strong statements bush said as he 
announced the us troop buildup 
the united states strongly supports and will cooperate with 
initiatives taken by governments in this hemisphere to address this 
crisis through regional diplomacy and action in the oas and 
elsewhere bush said 
the crisis in panama is a conflict between noriega and the 
people of panama bush said the united states stands with the 
panamanian people 
bush announced he was recalling the us ambassador to panama 
arthur davis and reducing the embassy staff to essential 
personnel a state department official said today about half of the 
93 embassy staff have been instructed to leave with their families 
the state department issued a travel advisory thursday for 
panama warning americans against travel there 
bush said us government employees and their dependents living 
outside of military bases would be returned to the united states or 
relocated for safety reasons from panama city and other locations 
to us bases in panama 
altogether there are roughly 51300 american in panama aside 
from military and diplomatic personnel and their dependents there 
are about 21300 businessmen and us retirees

workers compensation benefits awarded 
to a flight attendent who broke a leg while skiing during a layover 
in oregon have been reversed by a state appeals court 
the 1st district court of appeals previously has allowed 
benefits for injuries sustained off duty while on 
employmentrelated trips but it ruled the skiing trip didnt count 
we cannot conclude in the instant case that a 58mile daytrip 
to pursue ones love of skiing is either a minimal deviation or a 
reasonable and foreseeable activity especially in light of the 
nature of the sport of skiing which involves a great amount of 
risk district judge j klein wigginton wrote in the wednesday 
opinion 
a threejudge panel unanimously reversed benefits that had been 
awarded to eastern airlines flight attendant chandler rigdon by a 
state deputy commissioner of workers compensation the award was 
appealed by eastern and north river insurance co 
wigginton wrote that the skiing accident differed from an injury 
suffered by another eastern employee in a basketball game played at 
a ymca gym for which benefits were allowed by the court in a 1985 
case 
he noted guests at the hotel where the employee was staying had 
gym visitation rights and the game constituted sports activity 
reasonably necessary for personal health and recreation just like 
swimming in the hotel pool 
in a 1986 case the appeal court also allowed benefits for a pan 
am employee injured when a matchbook went up in flames as she was 
lighting a cigarette ruling that smoking is related to personal 
comfort 
we cannot conceive of a rule that would include downhill 
skiing in a list of such personal activities as drinking 
breathing eating or even smoking wigginton wrote 
the court also has allowed compensation for offduty injuries in 
activities that increase productivity as in the case of a lawn 
maintenance employee who was hurt when he took a dip in a river 
during a break

the vital importance of usjapan defense 
ties is a key reason why congress should approve the 7 billion fsx 
warplane deal a senior member of the senate foreign relations 
committee said friday 
it is important that we stay together with japan that we 
maintain that cooperation and alliance said sen richard g 
lugar rind as the senate headed into a second day of floor 
debate over the controversial deal 
he sought to rebut arguments by opponents that the proposal to 
jointly develop and produce a nextgeneration fighter for japan 
would jeopardize american jobs and technological prowess 
lugar said us industry would gain the same amount of business 
about 25 billion with the fsx as it would by selling wholly 
americanmade f16 fighters to japan as critics of the fsx have 
urged 
were not losing business by failing to sell the f16s off the 
shelf he said 
lugar contended that if the united states pulls out of the fsx 
deal this most likely would drive japan into a concerted effort to 
develop and produce the fighter on its own thus tending to 
undercut future usjapanese cooperation on defense 
i think that is a potentially dangerous course for japan and 
for the united states he said 
under the fsx deal general dynamics and mitsubishi heavy 
industries would jointly develop and produce the fsx an advanced 
version of the american f16 for deployment by japan in the late 
1990s general dynamics has headquarters in st louis but most of 
the fsx work would be done at its f16 plant in fort worth texas 
on thursday the senate foreign relations committee voted by 98 
to approve the agreement 
a vote by the full senate is expected early next week on a 
resolution aimed at halting the fighter deal a companion 
resolution of disapproval has been introduced in the house 
even if the resolutions were passed however a twothirds 
majority of both houses would be needed to override a likely 
presidential veto 
sen alan j dixon dill a leading opponent of the fsx 
called the proposal a rotten deal 
on the issue of usjapan defense ties dixon said that until 
recently our military relationship with japan has overshadowed our 
economic relationship but this cannot continue 
the illinois democrat argued that american technology to be 
provided to japan under the fsx deal will be exploited by the 
japanese to significantly advance their own aircraft industry 
we will be helping our fiercest economic competitor build a 
topnotch aerospace industry he said adding that japans future 
push into this area may be comparable to the japanese invasion 
of the us automobile market over the past decade 
sen terry sanford dnc said the fsx deal points to the need 
for this country to take steps to force japan to open its markets 
and thus help reduce the 55 billion trade deficit 
he said the united states should tell japan that you indeed 
need to change you need to open up you cant have it all

the nations top business leaders said 
friday they see little likelihood of a recession over the next two 
years but forecast a sharp slowdown in economic growth and little 
progress on taming inflation 
the business council composed of 65 executives from americas 
largest corporations said the economy already has begun to lose 
steam and that further slackening carries with it some risk of 
recession 
any time a growth slowdown occurs theres always some risk 
that it will soften into a recession but the group does not see 
that likely either this year or next said walter v shipley 
chairman of chemical banking corp 
the councils consensus forecast projects that economic growth 
as measured by the gross national product will slow from a healthy 
39 percent pace in 1988 to 14 percent by the end this year and 
will average 17 percent in 1990 
the panels economists actually forecast a rebound in activity 
by late next year with growth rising to a 31 percent pace by the 
fourth quarter of 1990 
that hints at the possibility that after a period of rest and 
renewal the american economy in 1991 will be headed toward an 
unprecedented ninth year of peacetime cyclical expansion shipley 
said 
the panels forecast was more pessimistic about prospects for 
reducing inflation which ran at a 61 percent annual rate in the 
first quarter of 1989 up from 44 percent in the last two years 
the central view is that although the flareup in prices early 
in 1989 was an aberration price behavior will not improve 
appreciably until mid1990 the report said 
the group projected inflation will average 5 percent for the 
next two years with some of the corporate economists who worked on 
the report anticipating it may exceed 6 percent 
the bush administration which projects gnp growth of 32 
percent this year is basing its optimistic economic assumptions in 
part on an expectation that inflation will be about 36 percent 
this year and fall to 35 percent in 1990 
richard breeden a top adviser to president bush told the 
business executives that the administration regards the recent 
slowing of economic activity as a pause and a base for further 
expansion 
in some ways it takes some pressure off monetary policy and 
the concerns about whether the economy was overheating breeden 
said after a private meeting with the executives gathered for a 
twoday retreat at a posh virginia resort 
the federal reserve board for a year has been pushing up 
interest rates in an effort to restrain economic growth and thus 
contain inflation 
the slowing of the economy in response to the feds action even 
as inflation remains strong has a growing number of analysts 
worried that the fed may inadvertently push the country into a 
recession 
a separate survey of 50 leading economists by the blue chip 
economic indicators newsletter found more than twothirds expect a 
recession to start either this year or next 
but the business council found three reasons to doubt a 
recession lies ahead a belief that the economy is free of 
fundamental imbalances an expectation that the fed is unlikely to 
nudge interest rates higher and the likelihood that strong 
economies in europe and japan will fuel demand for us exports 
nevertheless the council forecast slower progress on narrowing 
the nations trade deficit over the next two years the trade gap 
is projected at 100 billion in 1990 down from 11976 billion 
last year and 152 billion in 1987 
the economic slowdown should help narrow the trade gap somewhat 
by reducing import demand even as imports are rising the council 
said in addition an expectation that the dollar will decline in 
value should make us products more competitive overseas it said 
shipley said the councils forecast for slower economic growth 
while it could help ease inflationary pressures carries with it 
the risk of higher unemployment mediocre corporate profits 
sluggish gains in personal income and disappointing revenues for 
the federal treasury 
the group is projecting a 135 billion budget deficit for fiscal 
1990 35 billion above the limit established under the 
grammrudman deficitreduction law 
congress after protracted negotiations with the bush 
administration has drafted a budget that would hold the deficit to 
just under the 100 billion grammrudman limit but the business 
leaders remained concerned about the failure to make faster 
progress on reducing the deficit

the soviet union moved the ruble into the 
electronic age this week as the nations largest bank began issuing 
visa cards to replace the passbook savings account visa 
international reported friday 
this is a giant step forward said charles t russell 
president of visa international which is licensing sberbank in 
moscow to use the visa name visa international with nearly 200 
million cardholders worldwide is owned and operated by 21000 
banks 
russell said the move is the soviet unions first step toward 
automating its national banking system with the aim for this year 
of extending the card to more than 40000 customers and to five 
million within three years 
sberbank the nations only retail bank said it had begun 
issuing cards to a select group of 2000 customers who will be able 
to use them to withdraw up to 250 rubles a week from automated 
teller machines russell said 
foreign visa cards have been accepted in the soviet union since 
1974 through an arrangement with intourist which acted as an agent 
of the bank of americas visa card operation last year intourist 
itself became a visa member issuing its own internationally valid 
payment cards 
the sperbank visa card is to replace the traditional saviongs 
account passbook serving as a debit card enabling the holder to 
get to funds on deposit 
visa international spokesman david brancoli said at vi 
headquarters in san mateo that in the next six months service 
additions will include use of the card to make purchases at moscow 
department stores and restaurants with a few selected shops 
equipped with electronic pointofsale terminals

the city ambulance service took 13 minutes 
three more than its goal to respond to the home of schools 
chancellor richard green as he lay dying of an asthma attack 
officials said friday 
sixty to 90 seconds were consumed by the dispatcher completing 
an earlier call and another 60 to 90 seconds were used when the 
dispatcher tried to summon a private ambulance that turned out to 
be out of service they said 
the private ambulances operator lenox hill hospital had 
failed to notify the emergency medical service the ambulance was 
not available said lynn schulman an ems spokeswoman 
the city complained to lenox hill of that oversight in a letter 
thursday a lenox hill spokeswoman said it would respond sometime 
friday 
ems was called to greens home at 141 am wednesday and sent 
an ambulance five minutes later schulman said two minutes maybe 
three was the norm for dispatch still the overall 13minute 
response time was within the range of the ems goal of 10 
minutes or less for toppriority calls she said 
were not talking about something that took a halfhour or an 
hour schulman said its not a terrific response time but 
its not anything that there should be a lot of concern about 
she said it was impossible to say whether a faster response 
could have saved green 
last week 57 percent of priority ambulance calls were handled 
by the ems in under 10 minutes and the average response time was 
10 minutes and 23 seconds about a halfminute over the goal 
schulman said

industrialized nations must bear 
financial responsibility for saving the environment in developing 
nations according to an eecsponsored conference friday 
scientists historians philosophers and lawyers from europe 
asia and the united states concluded that the wealthy countries 
should pay for environmental cleanup and reforestation projects in 
the poorer nations 
the responsibility lies with us said carlos ripa di meana 
the european economic communitys commissioner for the environment 
developed nations must collaborate with poorer countries 
said jiro kondo president of the science council of japan in 
order to abate pollution you must be rich enough to introduce the 
proper equipment 
di meana said the question of the developing worlds 450 
billion foreign debt and possible debtfornatureswaps should be 
considered many environmentalists argue for the plan in which 
developing nations agree to preserve forested areas in return for 
debt relief 
developed countries cannot impose on developing countries 
without some kind of specific compensation for what were asking 
them to do said pierre marc johnson of mcgill university in 
montreal 
but environmental programs should not stymie economic growth 
said michael h robinson of the smithsonian institute in 
washington much of the destruction of rain forests is caused by 
subsistencelevel farmers who cut down trees for firewood or to 
plant crops he said 
halting the destruction cannot and must not involve freezing 
the development of the third world robinson said 
he suggested researchers look for alternatives to cutting trees 
such as developing crops that grow in the forest

a fugitive captured at the polo club in 
this coastal city cashed in on national concern for vietnam 
veterans by offering 100 forgotten man medallions authorities 
say 
michael j crosby persuaded 6000 people including many 
veterans to buy 100 silver medallions but only 400 people 
received them said assistant us attorney joan lancaster of 
minneapolis 
he also misled famed former test pilot chuck yeager to get him 
to make a videotape promoting a veterans memorial park supposedly 
benefited by the medallion sales prosecutors say

polo club of boca raton he was ordered held without bail until he 
can be returned to minneapolis where he faces a prison sentence of 
160 years from a november conviction on mail fraud charges 
i think he exploited the feelings of people that vietnam vets 
were not given a fair shake said lancaster through 
exploitation he induced people to make an investment they 
otherwise would be prevented through common sense to make 
an fbi agent in san diego said crosby is wanted there on charges 
of bilking an 88yearold woman out of 50000 in bank stocks 
crosbys company vets for vets used a testimonial from 
yeager to help solicit investors in a plan to build a memorial park 
near mount rushmore in the black hills of south dakota lancaster 
said but crosby reneged on a 90000 land contract and the park 
was not built 
yeager the first man to fly faster than sound testified on 
oct 19 that he had not signed a contract permitting crosby to use 
the videotape yeager said he had hoped to check out crosbys 
company before granting such permission

national party leader fw de 
klerk expected to become south africas next president called 
friday for a new political system free from domination by the white 
minority or black majority 
de klerk said the racially segregated system will have to 
change drastically and quickly but his speech before parliament 
dealt more with policies he rejects than details of the type of 
government he proposes 
he said the governing party wanted decisions by consensus 
dismissing the continued white rule supported by the conservative 
party and calling a oneperson onevote system favored by the 
antiapartheid democratic party totally unacceptable 
a mere majority decision would be domination and failure to 
reach consensus should be settled by a fair referee he said 
without elaboratation 
de klerk 53 became party leader when the post was vacated by 
president pw botha who suffered a stroke in january botha head 
of government since 1978 plans to retire after an election on 
sept 6 and de klerk the education minister is virtually assured 
of succeeding him 
de klerks speech in cape town came a day after constitutional 
development minister chris heunis announced his resignation last 
week heunis attracted wide publicity with a speech suggesting that 
blacks be given a role in parliament in the cabinet and in the 
selection of a president 
de klerk called heunis speech exploratory and said to 
deduce from his speech that the national party is now following 
the way to majority rule is untrue 
parliament includes subordinate chambers for asians and people 
of mixedrace but the 28 million blacks have no formal role of any 
sort in national politics 
white security can never be built on injustice towards 
others de klerk said white domination over the greatest 
portion of our country as the conservative party calls for leads 
inescapably to catastrophe and it will be our children 
particularly who will pay the price 
the conservative party stands for a minority government in a 
south africa that will by their own admission in perpetuity be 
populated by a majority of people of color it is unfair and does 
not pass the test of justice de klerk said 
the democratic party stands for a majority government in a 
country with such a massive and wide diversity as ours this is 
unfair to the smaller peoples and population groups their policy 
too fails the test of justice 
the conservative party leader andries treurnicht charged that 
de klerks policies would lead to black rule south africa is at 
the end of a failed political experiment and the national party 
government is in disarray he said 
zach de beer a coleader of the democratic party debated de 
klerk on what kind of stand he was taking 
de klerk condemns majority government and condemns minority 
government but what form of government does he not condemn he will 
have to get off the fence some time or other 
de klerk then responded i said we will come with a whole new 
constitution to be placed before voters in a referendum 
de beer replied he says he will change the constitution but 
i am begging him to tell us how he will change it

soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze pressured nato on friday to hold talks on eventually 
eliminating shortrange nuclear weapons in europe 
but west german chancellor helmut kohl joining other alliance 
leaders said scrapping the weapons was out of the question as long 
as the warsaw pact had a superiority in conventional forces and 
tactical nuclear weapons 
he held firm however on west germanys insistence that talks 
on reducing the weapons should be held promptly 
bonns insistence on shortrange arms negotiations has split the 
alliance before a crucial nato summit scheduled for the end of this 
month 
shevardnadze arrived in bonn one day after soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev announced a new arms reduction initiative 
during a meeting in moscow with us secretary of state james a 
baker iii 
gorbachev reiterated his call for negotiations on shortrange 
nuclear weapons and also announced a proposal to withdraw 500 
soviet battlefield nuclear weapons from europe unilaterally 
baker rejected the call for talks on shortrange nuclear 
arsenals and said the other part of the initiative was a public 
relations move 
after arriving in bonn shevardnadze referred to bakers 
reaction to gorbachevs initiative 
i wouldnt exactly say that our idea has stirred up a lot of 
enthusiasm among the americans shevardnadze said before 
beginning talks with west german leaders 
shevardnadze repeated the kremlins call for the eventual 
elimination of all shortrange nuclear missiles 
we have a lot of hard work ahead of us before we achieve the 
third zero option shevardnadze said using a disarmament term 
for the elimination of the shortrange weapons 
this our ultimate goal shevardnadze said 
but kohl following the nato line told reporters after his 
meeting with shevardnadze that total elimination was not an option 
as long as the warsaw pact has superior conventional and nuclear 
forces 
my position has been very clear on this kohl said for me 
it is not realistic now to strive for a denuclearization of 
europe 
but the chancellor said he believed the soviet proposals could 
give impetus to movement in disarmament discussions 
i think we are on the right path kohl said 
gorbachevs initiative has put new pressure on nato as it tries 
to work out a dispute over shortrange nuclear weapons 
west germany also wants superpower talks on reducing tactical 
nuclear arsenals but it does not advocate their complete removal 
under the current balance of military power in europe 
the united states and britain fear such talks could lead to 
total elimination of those arsenals in the face of the warsaw 
pacts superior conventional forces 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher met with 
baker in brussels on friday to discuss the disarmament dispute and 
the soviet proposals 
baker said after the meeting that he had failed to persuade west 
germany to back off its demands for us negotiations with the 
soviet union to reduce nuclear missiles in europe 
earlier friday kohl praised the new soviet initiative but also 
urged the kremlin to take further steps to erase its advantages in 
conventional and nuclear forces 
genscher is to meet shevardnadze again saturday before the 
soviet official departs 
the soviet union and west germany are expected to sign a number 
of agreements during the gorbachev visit that will expand trade 
cultural and business ties

a 35nation forum on press freedom ended without a 
communique friday as east bloc hardliners rejected criticism of 
their repressive practices from both east and west 
hungarys pledge to pull down no photography signs was among 
few promises made at the monthlong forum to monitor compliance 
with a new accord to improve the information flow between communist 
and capitalistminded nations 
but delegates said the sometimes heated criticism gave hope for 
improvements and the inclusion of journalists added to the 
openness of the meeting 
the accomplishment is latent or potential messages have been 
conveyed said canadian chief delegate william bauer 
you have to maintain constant pressure and hope in the end 
that the fear of being revealed as hypocrites will be greater than 
the fear of losing power said bauer ambassador to the 
conference on security and cooperation in europe that conference 
ended in january with the signing of an accord on press freedom and 
free speech 
the london information forum brought together all the 
signatories every european nation except albania plus canada and 
the united states 
romania the most reluctant signatory proved the major obstacle 
to a final communique although east germany and czechoslovakia also 
proved unwilling delegates said 
leonard h marks leader of the us delegation and former head 
of the us information agency said romania was the odd man 
out 
officials from romania where typewriter owners have to license 
their machines could not obtain permission to sign a communique 
for 48 hours so more than 60 proposals tabled at the forum had to 
be forwarded to the next meeting in helsinki in 1992 
proposals ranged from an east germanczechoslovak call to 
prevent distribution of neonazi propaganda to a 29point treatise 
signed by members of nato and the european economic community for 
the scrapping of a wide range of restrictions on information and 
the media 
bauer marks and others said they did not mind the lack of a 
concluding statement because they got what they needed some 
forward motion in how these commitments are carried out 
romania east germany bulgaria and czechoslovakia countries 
bauer said remain locked in a dark age of information drew 
the most criticism 
in an easteast outburst hungary charged romania with breaking 
the accord by banning an entire editorial staff from hungarian 
television 
czechoslovakia and bulgaria said such criticism was 
counterproductive 
there were instances when some of us were put in a position to 
resist the attempts to slide our debate on the wornout tracks of 
confrontation philip bokov bulgarias chief delegate told the 
meeting friday 
changes in hungary poland and the soviet union were applauded 
although marks said this doesnt mean theyve fully satisfied the 
regulations 
western governments did not escape unscathed delegates said 
mostly because of journalists and other nondiplomatic delegates 
they were loose cannon who could fire in any direction they 
wished to and they took up their opportunity to do so said bauer 
british delegates accused prime minister margaret thatcher of 
curbing press freedom through measures such as a ban on broadcast 
interviews with members of the outlawed irish republican army and 
its supporters 
but not all discussions were critical and signs of change 
emerged 
the soviet union promised to let foreigners use profits from the 
sale of periodicals there to pay for their incountry expenses in 
local currency 
several countries including the united states promised to 
speed up journalists visa application processes and cut red tape 
governing the import of hightech equipment 
hungary promised to award visas at its borders to journalists 
from countries that reciprocate and remove signs banning 
photography 
i can only confess that to date these notices have rather 
drawn the attention of passersby than kept away undesirable 
scrutiny chief delegate laszlo demus admitted

the father of an 11yearold girl was irate when a 
drugstore chain sent him a letter demanding he fork over 100 
because his daughter allegedly swiped an 89cent tube of lip balm 
he was successful in fighting the demand but retailers across 
the country are increasingly dispatching similar missives to 
shoplifters and their parents newly armed with state laws giving 
stores more power to fight sticky fingers 
the reason its popular it acts as a deterrent when the word 
gets out when you steal from the store youre going to pay for 
it carol sommer a founder of civil demand associates in sherman 
oaks calif said in an interview friday the 4yearold firm has 
clients nationwide and is only one of several law firms dedicated 
to this new weapon against shoplifting 
the tactic of recouping shoplifting losses by sending demand 
letters to shoplifters or their parents is known in the business as 
civil recovery or civil restitution 
its a boon for getting some money back said jack fraser 
operations chief for the new yorkbased national retail merchants 
association which has 55000 member stores 
according to fbi figures gathered from police nationwide for 
1987 the latest numbers available there 11 million shoplifting 
offenses averaging 96 per item 
since nevada passed the countrys first law offering retailers a 
civil remedy in 1973 it has been joined by 34 others the law 
takes various forms but the message is the same shoplifters wont 
get away with just a red face they can be hounded until they pay 
up 
laws governing civil recovery vary widely from state to state 
but in all of them adult shoplifters are held liable for damages 
and penalties in about half the states stores can go after minors 
by making parents responsible for restitution according to delany 
stinson senior investigations coordinator at dayton hudson 
department store co in minneapolis 
some states require that police be notified others like 
massachusetts do not 
some states restrict repayment to the value of the item others 
allow the retailer to tote up the additional costs of crime 
prevention damage to displays or injuries that occurred when the 
shoplifter was nabbed and even the cost of putting a new price tag 
on the stolen merchandise ms stinson said 
mrs sommer of civil demand associates stressed that demand 
letters are not intended to generate profits 
this is not a moneymaking operation mrs sommer said 
its meant to be a deterrent thats really the bottom line 
each time somebody gets in trouble at least 20 people know 
about it the word does get into the community said lewis 
shealy head of loss prevention at marshall fields and co 
department stores for five years the store has been demanding 300 
from each shoplifter last year it recouped close to 100000 
thats paying the salary of at least six security guards 
shealy said from his chicago headquarters which spends about 5 
million a year on guards and antitheft devices 
the success rate varies from 25 percent recovery to up to 90 
percent loss prevention experts say the betterheeled the 
shoplifter the easier it is to collect restitution largely 
because they are easier to track down than more transient lower 
income earners 
the massachusetts case of the girl and the lip balm was an 
instance of the retailer the cvs drugstore chain going further 
than the law allows the state attorney general said 
massachusetts law says parents of youngsters 7 to 17 years old 
are only liable for the cost of the item adult shoplifters can be 
taken to small claims court where they may be ordered to pay 50 
to 500 in damages on top of the items cost

the state department said friday it was 
pleased by the greek supreme courts ruling that a suspected 
palestinian terrorist was eligible for extradition 
it urged the greek justice minister to approve the decision 
the court in athens upheld an extradition order for mohammed 
rashid sought by the united states for the 1982 bombing of a pan 
am jetliner in hawaii which killed one person and injured 15 
rashid had appealed a lower court ruling granting his 
extradition and the high court had three times postponed a 
decision on the sensitive case 
we welcome this decision by the greek supreme court said 
state department spokesman richard boucher we note that this 
decision was made against the background of threats by terrorists 
who sought to unsuccessfully intimidate the greek judicial 
process he added 
under greek law the minister of justice has the final word in 
any extradition case but a decision could be postponed until after 
the june 18 general elections 
we look forward to a positive decision on the case by the 
greek minister of justice boucher said

maintenance depots and shipyards mismanaged 
money from a special pentagon program an investigator told 
congress friday moments after officials who oversee those 
facilities warned that budget cuts are undermining the readiness of 
us forces 
the general accounting office the investigative arm of 
congress found that army and air force maintenance depots navy 
shipyards and public work centers used money from the program on 
projects inconsistent with the programs original intent 
in some instances administrative rules were not followed and 
the facilities failed to keep adequate records said louis j 
rodrigues a gao official who testified before the senate armed 
services subcommittee on readiness sustainability and support 
earlier gen louis c wagner jr commanding general of the 
us army materiel command told the panel that due to a 15 
percent decline since fiscal 1987 in the budget for depot 
maintenance the purchase of spare and repair parts and military 
construction everything suffered including readiness 
we are living on the margin wagner said the zero 
actually negative real growth in funding is causing us concern 
with our ability to meet requirements readiness today is being 
maintained at the expense of sustainability during wartime 
gen alfred g hansen commander of the air force logistics 
command defined readiness as the ability to go to war and 
sustainability as keeping those forces equipped to fight over an 
extended period of time 
sustainability has suffered the past three to four years 
especially in spare parts he said congress has taken out 
about 700 million in sustainability in two years 
the commanders cautioned against reductions in the defense 
budget for depot maintenance spare parts and other logistics 
moments later the gao investigator described the problems his 
agency has found with the program that enables depots and shipyards 
to purchase equipment 
congress had asked the gao to review the pentagons asset 
capitalization program which has received about 5 billion from 
fiscal 1983 to fiscal 1989 
under the program facilities such as depots and shipyards buy 
equipment with working capital funds rather than direct 
appropriations the program requires that a facility initially 
finance the cost of the equipment and than charge its customers 
such as fleet commanders and weapon systems managers for the work 
performed 
the facilities then recover the equipment cost by including the 
depreciation expense in charges to its customers 
the gao found that the yorktown weapons station in virginia 
bought an insect sprayer for 5300 in 1984 used it about five 
times in fiscal 1987 and not once since then the sprayer was used 
on areas near family housing and a golf course but had nothing to 
do with the mission of the weapons station 
at the mare island shipyard near san francisco officials spent 
150000 on 24 vehicles for its tenants even though they knew 
pentagon rules prohibit the use of those funds on tenant activities 
is this proper for government employees to do sen carl 
levin dmich asked of the apparent violation of rules 
i dont think so rodrigues said 
the gao official attributed the problems to limited or unclear 
guidance on how the acp program should be managed 
specifically the agency found that no central acp office or 
coordinator was responsible for managing and overseeing all 
equipment minor construction and management information system 
development projects 
the defense department agreed that the program was not yet a 
sound capital investment program rodrigues said the department 
plans to take some action by the end of 1989 including naming a 
single manager to oversee the program he said

territorial officials said police 
killed a guerrilla friday and the united nations said it needs 
more monitors to check complaints against south africanled police 
in namibia 
south african and territorial troops started returning to their 
bases friday but pretoria otherwise delayed the un plan for 
namibias independence a delay it blames on an april incursion of 
several hundred southwest africa peoples organization guerrillas 
from angola 
officials said they killed the guerrilla when he resisted arrest 
at miershoop a town well south of the angolan border they gave no 
details and did not identify the dead man according to south 
african figures the shooting brings the toll to 316 guerrillas and 
27 security force members killed since april 
for two weeks the military and counterinsurgency police have 
been following tracks and interrogating villagers in the north to 
verify whether the guerrillas have left several guerrillas have 
been reported killed in the period and a senior police officer was 
relieved of duty after un police monitors investigated complaints 
there have been a very large number of complaints about the 
situation in northern namibia in the last few weeks said un 
spokesman cedric thornberry he did not elaborate 
police monitors already are busy investigating complaints 
against police in the north he said 
un special representative martti ahtisaari in charge of 
supervising the election process is negotiating with un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to increase the monitors 
from 500 to 1000 thornberry said 
under the un plan saturday was the deadline for south africa 
to scrap all discriminatory laws affecting elections and to reduce 
its military forces in the territory from 50000 to 12000 it also 
was the deadline for namibian refugees including disarmed swapo 
fighters to start returning 
a spokesman for louis pienaar the south africanappointed 
administratorgeneral said it was pointless to speculate on a 
timetable until after a meeting monday to verify whether all swapo 
guerrillas have left namibia 
observers from the united states the soviet union and cuba will 
attend the meeting of angolan and south african officials at 
ruacana on the border of angola and south africa 
the south african broadcasting corp said friday the meeting 
will in effect determine whether the independence timetable can 
go ahead as planned or whether it must be renegotiated 
ahtisaari allowed south african soldiers and southwest african 
paramilitary police to leave their bases april 1 to fight the 
guerrillas they returned to their bases two weeks ago for a 
60hour grace period to allow guerrillas to withdraw but 
territorial officials say 200300 swapo fighters remain in namibia 
the soldiers began returning to their bases again friday in 
preparation for renewed confinement to base from dawn saturday 
south africa has agreed to grant independence to namibia which 
it has controlled for 74 years in exchange for the withdrawal of 
50000 cuban troops in angola swapo guerrillas have fought from 
angolan bases in their 23year war against south african occupation

peoples park a hippie haven that 
touched off a bloody riot 20 years ago remains much as it was in 
1969 a vacant lot that the university of california wants to 
develop and activists want to see as a shrine to the 60s 
this is going to be one of the top 10 or top 20 most important 
pieces of land in history because it represents how the youth of 
the 60s stood up to the big powerful institutions that tried to 
control their lives said jon read a landscaper who helped 
organize the park project two decades ago 
a virtual truce between activists and the university that began 
in 1972 was disrupted last month when activists poured concrete for 
a a permanent toilet at the park the university had the concrete 
torn up twice and had four activists who chained themselves to 
the slab arrested 
on tuesday religious activists moved a 66foot mobile home set 
up as a restaurant and dubbed the peoples cafe to the park to 
feed the homeless no immediate action was taken to remove the blue 
trailer 
but for the first time last week ucberkeley officials said 
longstanding plans to use the 23 acres for student housing and 
recreational facilities are negotiable chancellor ira michael 
heymans statement is considered a breakthrough by many of the 
activists who tried to build peoples park in 1969 
the university created the vacant lot less than a mile from 
campus in 1967 tearing down a dozen buildings with the hopes of 
building student housing and recreation facilities on the 23acre 
site 
but in april 1969 activists attempted to claim the vacant 
building site for the people both to thumb their noses at the 
establishment and because they believed the universitys expansion 
plans were insensitive to environmental concerns said read 52 
thousands of activists fraternity members dropouts elderly 
residents and families trekked to the site with shovels and hoes to 
plant flowers and roll sod 
matters came to a head on may 15 1969 when the school tore up 
the plants and put a fence around the site and rioting ensued 
sheriffs deputies shot dozens of protesters with shotguns one 
james rector died a few days later an artist was blinded and two 
news reporters were among the wounded 
thengov ronald reagan sent 2000 national guard troops to 
occupy the city for 17 days a nightly curfew was imposed and 
meetings of more than three people were banned in the first week 
after the riot 1000 people were arrested 
demonstrators eventually tore down the park fence in 1972 and 
the university agreed to give the public limited use on a temporary 
basis 
since then it has become a sort of no mans land for the most 
part overrun with drug dealers and transients while the city and 
the university blame each other for the parks deteriorating 
condition 
todays city officials who include some of the demonstrators of 
1969 continue to fight development for a variety of reasons 
ordinary people built a park out of a mudflat and it came to 
symbolize that the individual can make a difference but the 
university is still coming to grips with that said mayor loni 
hancock 49 who planted vegetables when the park was founded 
you wouldnt build a volleyball court on the battlefield at 
gettysburg she added 
heyman has called city council opposition to development of the 
site a declaration of war but he told reporters recently that 
the issue could finally be resolved through negotiations with the 
city over the universitys longrange building plan 
aging activists are anxious for a resolution there have been 
rallies marches street fairs teachins and civil 
disobedience protests held to commemorate the parks 20th 
anniversary 
its sacred ground and i hope we all succeed someday in 
taking this land for everybodys enjoyment and use said jane 
goodwin 47 who said she was wounded by a shotgun pellet during 
the confrontation with police 
the current berlekeley student body president jeff chang who 
was just 2 when the rioting took place said todays students are 
angry with the university for rolling back community efforts to 
improve the park at every turn 
the university says that its rule against permanent facilities 
on the spot is needed for legal reasons 
sociologist todd gitlin a former president of the radical 
students for a democratic society argues the police reaction to 
the park symbolized the end of the radical political movements of 
the 60s 
peoples park was the last glimmering hope for a gladeyed 
movement one that would be ecumenical constructive and combative 
all at once he writes in the sixties years of hope days of 
rage published last year

rising business inventories combined with poor 
sales for the second consecutive month in march a sign of economic 
weakness the government said friday but economists said the trend 
is not worrisome yet 
the commerce department said inventories held on shelves and in 
back lots climbed 03 percent to a seasonally adjusted 7656 
billion in march following a 04 percent rise in february 
business sales meanwhile were unchanged at a seasonally 
adjusted 5073 billion after plunging 09 percent in february the 
sharpest fall since january 1987 
rising inventories unaccompanied by sales increases sometimes 
indicate a recession because manufacturers cut back production 
until inventories are sold off however analysts said stockpiles 
are not yet at troublesome levels 
inventories are fairly moderate said economist bruce 
steinberg of merrill lynch there does not seem to be an excess 
other than in the auto industry 
he said computerization and new inventory control techniques are 
enabling businesses to respond more quickly to changes and sales 
preventing large backlogs from building 
but economist robert g dederick of northern trust co in 
chicago said inventories do bear watching anything more than a 
moderate buildup could create a snapthewhip effect and topple 
the economy into a recession rather than the mild slowdown most 
economists expect 
we cant say theres been any rapid buildup but stocks 
have been rising rapidly enough that theyre vulnerable if sales 
growth remains sluggish he said 
march business activity left the ratio of inventories to sales 
at 151 meaning it would take 151 months to exhaust existing 
inventories at the march sales pace the ratio stood at 150 in 
february and 148 in january 
marchs rise in inventories was led by a 05 percent gain at 
manufacturing plants followed by a 04 percent climb in retail 
inventories and a 01 percent dip at the wholesale level 
in sales wholesalers showed a 02 percent gain and 
manufacturers posted a 01 percent decline sales were unchanged at 
retail stores in march an advance report on retail sales in april 
released thursday showed a modest 04 percent gain

one in five californians has been tested 
for the aids virus but few have taken steps to reduce the risk of 
contracting the deadly illness according to a gallup poll 
the poll paid for by hospital executives found that while the 
majority of residents have received some aids education the 
message is reaching a disproportionately low percentage of ethnic 
minorities and poor people those are the groups in which the 
disease acquired immune deficiency syndrome is spreading the most 
rapidly 
the survey part of the third annual california health care 
poll was one of the most comprehensive to be conducted in the 
state said george gallup who released the study thursday 
a demographic breakdown of those questioned indicated 22 percent 
with a high school education or less were not aware of any aids 
education programs while 25 percent with incomes of less than 
20000 said they were unaware among those with an annual income 
of 75000 or more awareness rose to 90 percent the poll found 
only 26 percent of blacks and 38 percent of asians had received 
some aids education according to the survey 
the results indicated that some education is reaching most 
californians but it suggests that the message be deepened and 
that we find new approaches for reaching those who are not getting 
the most effective messages possible said gallup 
the poll was conducted in april by telephone to a sample of 
1000 california households and was designed by the gallup 
organization inc producers of the gallup poll and executives 
with the southern california hospital council said robert nielsen 
vice president of the gallup organization 
the margin of error was plus or minus 31 percent 
onequarter of californians fear becoming infected by the aids 
virus but only 15 percent have changed their way of life to 
prevent contracting the illness the poll found

sudan is acting as mediator for its 
warbattered neighbor ethiopia holding peace talks between the 
marxist government and the east african nations largest rebel 
movement newspapers said friday 
reports in three independent dailies indicate some movement 
toward settling prolonged and expensive insurrections in both sudan 
and ethiopia which each support rebel movements fighting the 
others government 
the three newspapers said no date has been set for the 
conference but that ethiopian president mengistu haile mariam and 
leaders of the eritrean peoples liberation front have agreed to 
direct negotiations in khartoum 
sudanese prime minister sadek mahdi has said several times that 
peace is indivisible in northeastern africa 
such comments are taken to mean he would end his support for 
separatist rebels in ethiopias northernmost province of eritrea 
and other antimengistu groups if the ethiopian leader would 
abandon the rebel sudan peoples liberation front 
eritrean rebels who also espouse marxism have prosecuted 
africas longest civil war it began in 1961 and continued after 
mengistu and a clique of army officers deposed emperor haile 
selassie in 1974 
the eritrean peoples liberation front boycotted an april 
meeting in khartoum involving ethiopian officials and 
representatives of four other eritrean nationalist movements 
reportedly because of the type of autonomy the addis ababa 
government wanted to discuss in the absence of the largest rebel 
group the talks dissolved into squabbling and broke up with no 
progress 
the khartoum newspapers reported that mahdi gained approval for 
the talks from the eritrean fronts secretarygeneral asiasi aforgi 
at a meeting in the sudanese capital last month 
mengistu informed sudan of his governments complete 
agreement to further discussions on causes of the rebellion and 
to find a peaceful solution within the framework of a united 
ethiopian state the newspaper alayam reported 
rancorous for years relations between sudan and ethiopia have 
improved in recent months coinciding with major battlefield 
successes by rebel groups in both countries 
sudans civil war began six years ago when rebels from the 
south where the minority christians and animists are in a 
majority took up arms in demand of more autonomy from the dominant 
moslems of the north hundreds of thousands of people have died as 
a result mostly civilians who starved from warinduced famine 
on may 1 rebel leader john garang declared a unilateral 
monthlong ceasefire that will help a massive un relief effort 1 
to stockpile food and save thousands from starvation before annual 
heavy rains that cut off much of the region 
ethiopia and sudan which the world bank says are among the 
worlds poorest nations each spend more than a million dollars a 
days prosecuting their wars

a communist rebel has confessed 
to taking part in the april killing of a us army colonel 
officials said friday but they have not charged him because he 
keeps changing his story 
ricardo prestosa said rebels assassinated col james nick 
rowe because he was a big hindrance to the revolutionary 
movement according to a recorded confession played to reporters 
by brig gen cesar nazareno 
rowe 51 was slain april 21 outside the headquarters of the 
joint us military assistance group in suburban quezon city as he 
was being driven to work he was a vietnam war hero from mcallen 
texas whose book five years to freedom describes his five 
years of imprisonment by the viet cong and his escape in the 
philippines he commanded us ground forces 
a senior philippine officer said prestosa 29 admitted the 
slaying thursday to police in bataan province where he was 
arrested but recanted friday and has repeated the confession 
several times since then 
speaking on condition of anonymity he said the rebel was 
transferred to manila for further investigation he was arrested 
wednesday in his hometown of dinalupihan 40 miles west of the 
capital across manila bay in bataan 
nazareno the regional constabulary commander said nothing 
about prestosas renunciation and the bataan police commander 
col ramsey ocampo denied in a telephone interview that a 
confession was made at all the line was cut however and efforts 
to contact him again were unsuccessful 
a senior officer under ocampos command said prestosa claimed to 
have taken part in the attack on rowe he said investigators doubt 
the confession because prestosa appeared confused and kept 
changing his story 
nazareno said no charges have been filed 
in the tape prestosa said in the tagalog language that he knew 
rowe because we had been watching him for a long time 
why did you kill him the interrogator asked 
because he was a big hindrance to the revolutionary 
movement prestosa replied 
the communist new peoples army claimed responsibility the day 
after the slaying saying its fighters killed rowe because of 
alleged us interference in the philippine governments 
counterinsurgency campaign 
officials could give no reason for prestosas apparent confusion 
he wants to insinuate he was there the officer said when 
questioned repeatedly he says yes then after a while after 
thinking things over he backs out 
at least two details in prestosas recorded account did not jibe 
with fact another reason investigators are wary 
prestosa claimed rowe was killed around 10 am but police 
and witnesses say he was assassinated at 710 am 
the rebel also said the killers abandoned a car in manilas paco

at least 97 students from two schools 
were hospitalized after eating a free lunch provided under a new 
government program news reports and officials said friday 
the incident occurred thursday in the anuradhapur district 103 
miles northeast of colombo 
most of the students aged 819 showed symptoms of food 
poisoning but were discharged later in the day anuradhapur 
education director esw perera said in an interview 
elmo gooneratna senior assistant secretary for education 
blamed the local government for employing food contractors despite 
instructions for schools to preapre the food 
the contractors unconcerned about health standards were 
supplying the meals only with the intention of making profits he 
said in one instance a contractor was found transporting buns in 
a hearse 
the free meal scheme began on may 2 and will cost 59 million a 
year gooneratna said 
lunches consist of rice and curries or buns with fish or eggs 
and are supposed to provide 600 to 800 calories the project is to 
help raise nutritional standards in sri lanka where more than 40 
percent of the 16 million people live below the poverty line

the new head of the star wars research program 
said friday he has doubts whether the highly publicized brilliant 
pebbles concept of spacebased defenses will be deployed as it is 
now envisioned 
i have to be skeptical said lt gen george l monahan jr 
who took command of the strategic defense initiative organization 
on feb 1 
defense secretary dick cheney and the former head of sdio lt 
gen james abrahamson have placed great hope in brilliant pebbles 
a system of 3000 to 5000 spacebased interceptors each would be 
about four feet long weighing less than 100 pounds and would have 
the capability to spot track and destroy enemy intercontinental 
ballistic missiles 
earlier concepts for other systems called for deployment of 
several hundred satellites each equipped with about 10 spacebased 
interceptors sbi to destroy enemy rockets with an estimated 
deployment cost of 691 billion 
abrahamson said in an unusual end of tour memorandum that 
brilliant pebbles could be deployed for 25 billion including a 
separate system of surveillance satellites 
monahan however in his first meeting with reporters declined 
to project a deployment price for brilliant pebbles and said his 
organization had not sharply increased money devoted to the project 
current pentagon spending on brilliant pebbles research is 
running at an annual rate of 46 million said monahan up from the 
1988 level of 40 million but the funding level is likely to 
change based on the outcome of a review this summer 
president bush has lowered the proposed star wars budget from 
59 billion to 46 billion for the current year a level that 
monahan says will delay development of the entire system for about 
two years 
at the current pace of research monahan said the pentagon 
should have enough information to allow the president and congress 
to decide by 1993 or 1994 whether to deploy a ballistic missile 
defense system 
brilliant pebbles and other spacebased systems will be reviewed 
this summer by the defense science board a pentagon group and the 
jasons a team of university scientists said monahan 
one possible outcome of that review might be a decision to 
combine elements from brilliant pebbles and other systems for 
example placing two three or four interceptors aboard each 
satellite he said 
brilliant pebbles developed at the governments lawrence 
livermore national laboratory in california solves a number of 
problems that had vexed star wars researchers he said but the 
sheer number of envisioned pebbles created new communications 
and production challenges 
from what we see today things look doable but we are not yet 
ready to jump out ahead on it said monahan 
a key problem that scientists must solve for brilliant pebbles 
said monahan was communicating to the satellites the command to 
open fire on enemy boosters within the first two minutes of their 
flight 
you have to pull the trigger real fast he said the 
decision must be made by human beings and not by computers he said 
abrahamson and the chief scientist in the brilliant pebbles 
program lowell wood have called brilliant pebbles a major 
breakthrough because the system would be made on a production line 
vastly reducing the cost 
but monahan declined to speculate on the cost 
nobody has yet massproduced spacecraft before he said

more than twothirds of the us border crossings 
open to fuel imports will be closed to oil tanker trucks in an 
effort to keep tainted products from entering canada the federal 
government announced friday 
the globe and mail newspaper reported monday that solvents pcbs 
and waste oil were mixed secretly into fuels in the past four 
years sold to customers in western new york and taken across the 
border for sale in the canadian provinces of ontario and quebec 
environment minister lucien bouchard announced at a news 
conference in ottawa that oil tanker trucks will be able to enter 
canada at only 50 of the approximately 175 border crossings used 
for petroleum products 
bouchard said the new federal action will concentrate on spot 
check sampling of fuel cargos crossing the international borders 
he said the provincial governments of ontario quebec and alberta 
will carry out sampling in the fuel distribution system 
the report in the globe and mail which calls itself canadas 
national newspaper quoted unidentifed law enforcement sources 
and participants in what it said was lucrative illicit trafficking 
it said more than 50 interviews were conducted over the past five 
months in western new york and toronto 
it said the shipments of altered gasoline diesel and industrial 
heating fuel originated in new york state 
bouchard also announced that the royal canadian mounted police 
would lead a task force investigating the report that millions of 
gallons of imported fuel were contaminated by the the toxic wastes 
us governors from the great lakes state visiting canada on 
thursday and friday were asked repeatedly at their public 
appearances about the report 
michigan gov james blanchard speaking to reporters on a boat 
tour of toronto harbor said the news was to be taken seriously 
but its something thats basically news to us 
the governors said state environmental officials would discuss 
the issue at a summer meeting

the president of the national association of 
wheat growers said friday he has urged the agriculture department 
to keep restrictions on 1990 production despite severe losses to 
this years crop 
reggie wyckoff a genoa colo wheat farmer said in a letter 
to department officials that allowing allout production next year 
would do serious damage to the level of recovery that has been 
achieved so far 
the usda is required by law to announce by june 1 the level of 
landidling that will be required in order for 1990 producers to 
qualify for federal price supports and other benefits on their 
wheat crop 
wheat farmers were required to setaside 10 percent of their 
wheat base acres for 1989 but drought and lateseason freezes in 
kansas and some other major winter wheat states have trimmed this 
years harvest outlook sharply 
the department may be under some pressure to discontinue its 
acreage reduction program or arp in 1990 he said a zero 
requirement could put the us back on a rapid course to 
surpluses wyckoff added 
next years idling requirement should not be larger that the 10 
percent for 1989 he said

the scandalplagued governing party was at a loss 
for a leader friday after senior politician masayoshi ito refused 
requests that he lead the party and government 
analysts commenting on the unexpected refusal cited itos 
statements that the liberal democratic party does not realize how 
seriously it has been damaged by an influencepeddling scandal that 
has shrunk its popularity rating in polls to less than 4 percent 
mr ito formally expressed his rejection and despite 
party leaders persistent attempts to persuade him did not change 
his position party spokesman ryutaro hashimoto told a news 
conference 
frankly we are at a loss he said 
ito 75 is among a handful of senior members of the party 
untainted by the recruit scandal which has forced prime minister 
noboru takeshita to announce his resignation takeshita is expected 
to step down later this month and three of his cabinet ministers 
already have resigned 
fourteen businessmen and exbureaucrats have been arrested on 
bribery or other charges in connection with sales of unlisted 
bargainpriced shares in a subsidiary of recruit co an 
information conglomerate 
the party had asked ito to replace takeshita and improve the 
partys image before summer elections for half the seats in the 
upper house of parliament because the party has a huge majority in 
parliament its leader is virtually guaranteed to become prime 
minister 
hashimoto said itos reasons for refusing were his health and 
disagreements with party leaders over reform and the way the party 
is taking responsibility for the scandal 
this week ito complained the party lacks a sense of crisis and 
he told reporters revolutionary changes in the partys way of 
thinking are needed 
he had demanded the resignations of all politicians linked to 
corruption cases and an end to factions in the party which is made 
up of half a dozen cliques 
fundraising plays a major role in factionalism and the scandal 
takeshita has admitted receiving more than a million dollars in 
donations from recruit 
ito wanted the job but didnt feel he would be able to carry 
out reform under the current circumstances said political 
analyst asao yamaguchi 
there is really no feeling of crisis in the party they have 
been at the top so long they just dont realize the danger and it 
will take big losses at the polls to open their eyes he said 
in a saturday editorial the nationally circulated newspaper 
asahi shimbun agreed 
there was a gaping crevice between ito and the other ldp 
members including takeshita over the degree to which they 
recognized the peoples fury toward politics that crevice was 
never bridged it said 
former finance minister kiichi miyazawa head of the party 
faction to which ito belongs told reporters he does not see the 
rejection as final and will try to change itos mind 
the partys top four executives ito among them are to meet 
saturday to pursue the question of a leader 
yamaguchi said shin kanemaru a former deputy prime minister and 
takeshitas mentor now is the most likely candidate for prime 
minister 
however kanemaru is only a year younger than ito and like him 
suffers from diabetes

president bush on friday revived 
an eisenhowerera open skies proposal for mutual eastwest 
surveillance flights as he exhorted the soviet union to begin a 
friendship that knows no season of suspicion no chill of 
distrust 
he praised soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs political 
reforms and new policies of openness but he also declared mr 
gorbachev dont stop now 
to show there is nothing to hide he suggested other members of 
the sovietled warsaw pact and of nato should join the superpowers 
in allowing unarmed aerial intelligencegathering flights over 
their territories 
such surveillance flights complementing satellites would 
provide regular scrutiny for both sides bush said the very 
soviet willingness to embrace such a concept would reveal their 
commitment to change 
the president commented in a speech to graduating seniors at 
texas aampm university he received an honorary doctoral degree and 
quipped to the students your last day of college had to end with 
another political science lecture 
bush announcing the completion of his administrations 3month 
review of ussoviet relations also said he would work with 
congress to ease a 15yearold denial of trade credits in 
recognition of moscows liberalizing of emigration for soviet jews 
his speech was one of a series of foreignpolicy addresses 
planned by the president 
it came a day after soviet president mikhail s gorbachev told 
secretary of state james a baker iii that the soviets would 
withdraw 500 shortrange nuclear weapons in eastern europe 
for his part bush did not respond directly to that gesture 
though he called on the soviet union to make deeper cuts in 
conventional forces in europe 
however national security adviser brent scowcroft told 
reporters aboard air force one that gorbachevs announcement was 
a ploy that he said is designed principally to create 
problems within the nato alliance 
the administration has opposed eastwest talks on eliminating 
natos tactical nuclear weapons a stance that has caused a rift 
with west germany and several other nato allies 
bush mixed new overtures to ease eastwest barriers with a dose 
of the kind of skepticism he has expressed before urging gorbachev 
to match promises of a new openness with deeds 
the soviet union has promised a more cooperative relationship 
before only to reverse course and return to militarism soviet 
foreign policy has been almost seasonal warmth before cold thaw 
before freeze bush said 
he called on the soviets to permit the distribution of banned 
newspapers and books to disavow links with terrorist nations such 
as libya to tolerate more political dissent within its borders and 
to free eastern europe from its grip 
one day it should be possible to drive from moscow to munich 
without seeing a single guard tower or strand of barbed wire he 
said 
in short tear down the iron curtain bush said echoing 
former president reagans 1987 appeal at the berlin wall to 
gorbachev to tear down this wall 
bush praised recent moves toward political and economic reform 
saying a new breeze is blowing in the soviet union echoing 
the phrase he used in his inauguration speech 
we are impressed by limited but freely contested elections we 
are impressed by a greater toleration of dissent we are impressed 
by a new frankness about the stalin era 
mr gorbachev dont stop now he added 
bushs idea for surveillance flights was an effort to breathe 
new life into a proposal first made by president dwight eisenhower 
in 1955 
eisenhowers open skies proposal rejected by the soviets at 
the time called for both the soviets and the united states to send 
surveillance flights over each others territory to check on 
military installations 
bush aides said nato allies had been consulted on the new 
proposal and while some especially canada had welcomed it 
others had reserved judgment 
a white house official speaking on the condition that his name 
not be used said baker had presented the proposal this week to 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
such a plan might seem less significant now with the 
highdefinition photographic capability of spy satellites than in 
eisenhowers time 
however symbolically its very important scowcroft said 
he also said planes would have some advantage over satellites in 
cloudy conditions 
a fact sheet distributed by the white house said that details 
including who would provide the aircraft for the surveillance 
flights would have to be determined later if moscow agreed to the 
propsal 
decisions on surveillance flights over other countries would 
have to be decided by each nation the official said 
bush also said he was ready to work with congress in easing the 
landmark jacksonvanik amendment to the 1974 trade act that denied 
mostfavorednation trade status to the soviet union so long as it 
barred free emigration 
bush said he was heartened by recent moves to permit soviet jews 
to leave the country as recently as thursday moscow told the 
united states that 24 jewish families long denied emigration would 
be permitted to leave 
some 19000 soviet jews were permitted to leave last year 
bush said should the soviet union codify its emigration laws 
in accord with international standards and implement its new laws 
faithfully i am prepared to work with congress for a temporary 
waiver of the jacksonvanik amendment 
early reaction from jewish groups was positive 
for example seymour d reich chairman of the conference of 
presidents of major american jewish organizations said in a 
statement president bush has set fair and firm conditions for 
the granting of a waiver those conditions offer a test of 
soviet intentions we trust that the ussr will meet that test and 
institutionalize by law the reforms it has begun to put into effect 
in its emigration practices 
however sen jesse helms rnc urged bush to be cautious 
saying that no waiver should be granted until after open 
emigration policies have been in effect over a long enough period 
to prove the soviets are committed to permanent and open 
emigration

an exhausted eightman expedition seeking to 
dramatize environmental hazards in the arctic has been hampered by 
melting ice on the last days before its expected arrival at the 
north pole 
theyre walking nonstop it seems spokeswoman tracey 
carpenter said in a telephone interview from icewalk expedition 
headquarters in ottawa theyre zigzagging around all this broken 
ice and making good progress 
on arrival the expeditions leader british explorer robert 
swan will become the first man to walk to the north and south 
poles he reached the south pole with two other men in 1986 
progress has been slower than hoped in the last leg because of 
the early spring weather conditions that produce crumbling 
drifting ice and the threat of open seas 
its looking good were pretty convinced that its going to 
be sunday carpenter said 
she said the expedition was 28 miles from the north pole on 
friday the men have been averaging 14 miles daily 
plans are for an icewalk flight to pick up the expedition on 
sunday at the north pole and fly them to eureka on ellesmere island 
the expedition which has a 4 million budget had hoped to 
complete the 457mile trek by midmay at the latest the departure 
was several days later than hoped because of heavy snow in march 
temperatures have been warmer than expected in recent days 
reaching as high as 28 degrees fahrenheit 
its just wending their way through half water half ice 
carpenter said 
solar flares have frequently disrupted radio contact since the 
expedition began march 20 from cape aldrich on ellesmere island 
supply flights have succeeded in reaching them 
it differs from other arctic expeditions in using only human 
power to travel and take supplies along the eight men ski but do 
not use dogsleds or skimobiles 
the explorers have been gathering air and snow samples along 
their route as well as collecting data on the effect of cold on 
humans 
canadian research over the past four years in the arctic has 
turned up dozens of pesticides and other toxic substances in the 
regions fragile ecosystem many of them entering the food chain 
attention also has focused on the thinning of the worlds ozone 
layer most notably at the worlds poles and on acid rain 
the icewalk team includes members from britain canada the 
united states the soviet union japan australia and west germany 
the american is darryl roberts from new york city he had 
suffered frostbite on his feet in april when temperatures fell to 
67 degrees below zero 
since the beginning there was great concern that hed have to 
leave carpenter said he was very committed to carrying on 
the soviet member dr mikhail malakov treated roberts and four 
others for frostbite malakov who also experienced frostbite 
completed the successful canadasoviet polar bridge expedition last 
year

overcoming bad lighting and computer problems 
13yearold albert kurz of holland pa became the nations sixth 
mathcounts champion friday by calculating the price of a stock 
the finals in the junior high school math competition sponsored 
by nasa the national society of professional engineers and other 
organizations capped nine months of local and state contests 
entered by more than 700000 students 
a total of 224 math whizzes all but 30 of them boys made it 
to the countdown rounds in washington as the winner albert takes 
home a 10000 scholarship a gold medal and a personal computer 
he will also spend a week at the us space camp in huntsville 
ala and on monday he goes to the white house to meet president 
bush 
lenny ng of chapel hill nc and robert kleinberg of wales 
center ny the second and third place finishers received 
scholarships of 6000 and 4000 respectively they will also 
visit the space camp as will ngs three colleagues on the 
topscoring state team from north carolina 
no calculators are permitted in the competition students use 
pencil paper and their minds to figure out the problems 
the 10 finalists viewed problems on computer monitors and 
punched buzzers to indicate they were ready with answers 
sometimes even before the master of ceremonies had started reading 
the problem to the audience 
there were a number of tense moments some because the lighting 
made it hard to see who had hit his buzzer and the last round was 
delayed by a computer malfunction 
albert fended off all challengers with lightningfast answers to 
questions such as the diagonal of a cube is the square root of 
27 what is the volume and if y equals the negative value of 
the absolute value of x minus 2 for what value of x will y attain 
its maximum value 
the answers 27 and 2 
the winning problem posed the following question the price of 
a stock increased 10 percent and then decreased 10 percent before 
it was sold for 99 what was the original price of the stock 
albert gave the correct answer of 100 
i spent nights from 3 pm to 10 pm studying and it really 
paid off albert said after his victory when asked how he could 
figure problems so quickly he replied i cant do them on paper 
because my hands too shaky to write i dont know i just do it 
albert said his mother is a housewife and his father a civil 
engineer he said his hobbies include basketball ping pong and 
computer games and he would like to become either an engineer or 
a mathematician 
mathcounts is described as the only national math coaching and 
competition program for junior high school students it is designed 
to stimulate students interest in math before they must make 
course decisions that may affect their career choices 
other mathcounts sponsors in addition to nasa and the engineers 
association are cna insurance cos the national council of 
teachers of mathematics cray research foundation and general 
motors foundation

the number of workers employed by farmers 
showed a sharp seasonal increase this spring but trailed yearago 
levels the agriculture department said friday 
a quarterly report said the hired work force on farms was 
estimated at 830000 workers during the week of april 915 used for 
a survey compared with 936000 a year earlier in january the 
previous survey showed 701000 hired workers on farms 
those did not include 198000 agricultural service workers 
provided by crew chiefs and labor contractors a year earlier those 
totaled 224000 workers 
the report said rain during the survey week slowed field work in 
the southeast and most of the delta also spring wheat planting 
was behind the normal pace in the major production states 
the report said the national figures for hired workers had a 
sampling error of 51 percent 
average pay for all workers hired directly by farmers was 535 
per hour up from 5 per hour a year earlier but below the average 
of 551 in january the report said 
for workers hired by contractors there was no national wage 
rate available however workers in california were reported at 
645 per hour in april compared with 642 in january and 568 a 
year earlier florida workers averaged 624 579 and 615 per

a federal judge on friday accepted 
the proposed payment of up to 100 million to settle hundreds of 
lawsuits stemming from the 1986 dupont plaza hotel fire that killed 
97 people 
us district court judge raymond l acosta said he was 
generally satisfied with the outofcourt settlement in one of 
the largest disaster litigations in american history 
he said the agreement was binding on all parties but contingent 
on unspecified conditions being met within 60 days the judge said 
the first of three phases of the complex trial will remain in 
effect until july 14 
in the meantime he issued a 60day stay against all claims 
against the defendants 
agreement in the case involving about 2300 plaintiffs seeking 
damages from 230 defendants was reached tuesday and approved 
thursday night by district judge louis c bechtle in philadelphia 
the defendants who filed 264 separate lawsuits had sought 18 
billion 
us supreme court chief justice william rehnquist had appointed 
bechtle to head the negotiations bechtle was the presiding judge 
in a similar case involving the 1980 mgm grand hotel fire in las 
vegas that killed 84 people the settlement in that case totaled 
200 million 
under the agreement signed in philadelphia 50 million will be 
paid by the insurer american international underwriters corp and 
35 million by the dupontfamily group of partnerships and 
individuals who owned many hotel enterprises including the dupont 
plaza other insurance carriers will pay the remaining 15 million 
in an interview after fridays hearing acosta said the 300page 
agreement calls for the plaintiffs to receive 85 million in what 
he described as hard money and 15 million in soft money 
he said hard money meant immediately available funds such as 
cash bonds and property soft money refers to funds the defendants 
said they could raise but could not guarantee 
the plaintiffs agreed to accept any portion of the 15 million 
the defendants could raise 
the judge said he could not reveal the critical conditions 
to be completed over the next 60 days 
jorge ortiz brunet a lawyer for the plaintiffs said they 
generally dealt with deadlines for the defendants to pay their 
share of the settlement 
the fire on dec 31 1986 killed 97 people and injured more 
than 140 it broke out in a ballroom on the first floor of the 
22floor hotel and most of the victims were trapped in the casino 
the beach hotel was filled on new years eve with nearly 1000 
guests 
the disaster occurred during bitter labor negotiations between 
the teamsters union and the hotel management three former 
employees who were members of the union were accused of setting the 
fire and were convicted in 1987 of murder the union denied any 
responsibility 
the hotel was cited for 25 violations by the occupational safety 
and health administration including lack of emergency exits from 
the casino where 84 of the victims periushed 
in the first phase of the trial which began march 15 lawyers 
for the plaintiffs claimed that duponts parent company hotel 
systems international sought a coverup to avoid liability 
the second phase of the trial deals with hotel suppliers and 
acosta said those proceedings would begin in 45 days regardless of 
whether conditions he set down for ending the first phase were 
satisfied 
the final phase deals with a lawsuit filed by the hotel against 
the puerto rican chapter of the teamsters union 
the 425room hotel in san juans condado district has been 
renovated but has not reopened

randy kraft a computer programmer 
accused of leading a double life as a brutalizer and killer of 37 
young men in three states was convicted friday of 16 murders 
the jury after deliberating into a 12th day also found kraft 
guilty of one count of sodomy and one count of sexual mayhem he 
was acquitted of one sodomy count 
orange county superior court judge donald a mccartin scheduled 
a hearing tuesday to set a date for a penalty phase of the trial to 
decide whether kraft 44 should be put to death 
the case already has taken six years from arrest to verdict 
hampered by a multitude of defense motions the illness of a judge 
the size of the case and the need for defense attorneys to prepare 
for the possible introduction of the 21 other deaths into the 
penalty phase 
judy nelson whose son geoffrey nelson 18 was slain in 1983 
burst into tears after the verdicts were read 
i know hes guilty he knows hes guilty every mother in 
there had 16 beautiful sons and he should pay she said 
the defendant sighed loudly as the court clerk began reading the 
verdicts then showed no other emotion during the 30minute 
recitation 
besides the 12year span of orange county slayings for which he 
was convicted authorities have said kraft is suspected of killing 
21 young men in california oregon and michigan 
deputy district attorney bryan brown contends that kraft picked 
up hitchhikers disabled them by plying them with drugs and 
alcohol sexually tortured and mutilated them and then strangled 
them 
the prosecutor described kraft who has an unusually high iq of 
129 as a fetishist who kept some of the dismembered parts of his 
victims in his refrigerator freezer 
rodger devaul sr whose son rodger 20 was among the victims 
said he was relieved the ordeal of trial had finally ended 
it was six years ago that he was arrested theres no way it 
should take this long to come to a verdict he said there is 
no need for the families to suffer this long 
brown would not comment saying only its tough right now when 
were between these phases 
jurors considered seven months of testimony including evidence 
of necrophilia 
when kraft was arrested police said they found 47 color 
photographs of young men many of them nude and apparently dead 
they also found a notebook with more than 60 handwritten notations 
which prosecutors have called a death list 
kraft hasnt spoken about the case since a jailhouse interview 
in which he denied killing anyone 
he was arrested when california highway patrol officers pulled 
him over for erratic driving and discovered a strangled marine in 
the passenger seat 
defense attorneys c thomas mcdonald and james merwin never 
called kraft to the witness stand they argued that evidence 
against him was inconclusive and they attempted to raise doubts by

a school official friday defended a jobtraining 
program that teaches housekeeping to developmentally disabled 
students but admitted he erred by letting students clean the homes 
of teachers and principals 
the madison school of the wyandotte district has 183 
developmentally disabled students from 14 detroitarea school 
districts the students are sent to a number of sites for job 
training and superintendent michael williamson said housekeeping 
is part of the training 
the program provides an excellent opportunity for handicapped 
youngsters and can afford them some measure of independence 
williamson said 
i think there was an error in judgment made in using teachers 
and principals homes because it leaves us open to 
exploitation by the public and the press 
on wednesday the mothers of two of the students sandra adkins 
and laura murphy filed suit in wayne county circuit court 
claiming they never gave permission for their disabled children to 
be used in child slavery 
williamson said the lawsuit was outrageous exploitation on the 
part of the mothers 
the lawsuit asks the court to end housekeeping training unless 
the students receive parental permission and are paid minimum wage 
the women allege their daughters had to clean and scrub floors at 
the homes of teachers and principals 
they are supposed to be learning for future employability 
said richard a neaton the mothers lawyer i seriously question 
whether they need to clean teachers homes to do that 
adkins and murphy said they had given permission only for their 
children to receive training in a clothing store 
when the parents told us they didnt want their kids to go we 
honored those parents requests madison principal cheri kodrich 
said the lawsuit came as a total shock i have nothing to 
defend what we do is legitimate 
williamson and kodrich said all parents were notified in writing 
that their children might work at different sites if another 
student missed school the mothers said they never received such 
notice 
i never would have agreed to that said adkins whose 
15yearold child is mentally impaired she goes to school to 
learn to function as an adult not to clean the principals house 
the madison program was defended by patricia hauser executive 
director of the association for retarded citizens in downriver 
the association has found the wyandotte schools to be 
excellent she said 
wilma clark mother of a 17yearold boy in the program said 
she always receives written notices of any changes in her sons 
training 
every time i receive a letter telling where what the job is 
about and how long hell be there she said

president bush on friday said the united 
states would hold an international workshop this fall to seek 
solutions to global warning as a step toward reaching an eventual 
treaty on the problem 
environmentalists hailed the move as a step forward in singling 
out global warming as a world environmental threat and reaching a 
consensus on how best to deal with it but they questioned whether 
the president was moving quickly enough 
in a statement bush said he expects the international workship 
the us will host in october will lead to international 
scientific consensus on the seriousness of the global warming 
issue and to formal negotiations on a treaty to tackle the 
problem 
the meeting will examine a range of financial economic and 
technical issues that might be affected by worldwide curbs on the 
release of socalled greenhouse gases into the atmosphere 
these gases mainly carbon dioxide and other pollutants associated 
with burning fossil fuels are widely blamed for causing rising 
temperatures 
william reilly head of the environmental protection agency 
said the united states and 29 other countries agreed at a united 
nationssponsored meeting in geneva on friday that the workshop 
should be the next step in dealing with global warming 
in a telex to geneva on thursday the white house directed its 
delegation to the conference to press for the workshop saying 
the scope and importance of this issue are so great that it is 
essential for the us to exercise a leadership role 
the administration has been criticized recently for failing to 
take the initiative on international environmental issues there 
reportedly has been internal disagreement on the urgency of the 
global warming problem and how aggressively to proceed 
diplomatically on the subject 
one faction which includes reilly and secretary of state james 
a baker iii has sought to move more rapidly toward developing a 
treaty but white house chief of staff john sununu has expressed 
reservations about moving too quickly before all of the economic 
and technical issues have been resolved according to sources 
the administrations pronouncements brought mixed responses from 
environmentalists 
its a positive move by the president said rafe pomeranze 
of the world resource institute but he said negotiations on a 
treaty likely would not even begin until late 1990 under the 
administrations timetable 
joseph goffman of the environmental defense fund said the 
presidents recognition of the need to press ahead on a treaty is 
forward progress but added what we need is for the president 
to get out in front on this issue 
sen john chafee rri a ranking member of the senate 
environment protection subcommittee said he welcomed the bush 
initiative and didnt feel the president was lagging behind other 
world leaders 
its been clear from the start that he the president gives 
this issue the highest priority said reilly calling the fall 
workshop a giant step toward getting an international consensus 
reilly repeatedly has rejected suggestions that the global 
warming problem can be dealt with unilaterally he has said any 
progress industrial nations make in reducing pollutants linked to 
the warming process could be nullified without cooperation from 
third world nations as they develop their industries 
scientists believe that global temperatures could rise by 4 
degrees to 9 degrees fahrenheit by the middle of the next century 
because increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other manmade gases 
in the atmosphere will trap and retain heat from the sun in a 
process similar to what happens in a greenhouse 
such a warming trend could melt polar ice caps and allow sea 
levels to rise cause severe droughts and storms and severely 
disrupt the earths biological systems 
scientists at a senate hearing earlier this week indicated the 
problem may be developing faster than their computers had 
predicted one government scientist raised a furor when he 
disclosed that the administration had changed his testimony to 
apparently downplay the urgency of the matter

a cheyennearapaho woman disabled from polio 
said friday she cant get welfare as long as she is on federal oil 
royalty rolls and since those checks stopped coming regularly she 
lost her home and children 
mary limpy choked back tears as she told a special investigating 
committee of the senate select committee on indian affairs that she 
has lived three years in an abandoned house in oklahoma city 
because she could not pay her bills 
the checks stopped coming regularly in 1983 said mrs limpy 
who said the state took custody of her two youngest children two 
years ago 
now the money comes sporadically and the bureau of indian 
affairs which manages her three wells cant say why she told the 
committee 
i do not get my royalty checks right after the gas or oil is 
sold she said i get my checks sometimes four to seven months 
later recently it has been about four months later 
she said the checks average 30 to 60 she told the committee 
she would be better off if she did not have the royalties at all 
and could apply for state welfare 
mrs limpy said her wells originally were leased by the tenneco 
oil co which sold the leases to koch oil she said at one point 
she heard the wells had been capped but the farmer who works the 
land where the wells are located said trucks kept going on and off 
the oilfield 
witnesses before the committee earlier in the week testified 
that koch which is based in wichita kan had been stealing oil 
from indian wells a charge the company has denied 
mrs limpy is part of a federal classaction lawsuit charging 
that the government has violated its trust responsibilities to 
indians with oil well interests said attorney steve moore 
moore said the suits plaintiffs include 7000 allottees with 
interest in 944 oil leases in western oklahoma 
that lawsuit has been held under advisement by judge ralph 
thompson of the western district of oklahoma for 2 years said 
moore 
it seems outrageous that a federal judge has refused to act 
when you have the obvious need said deconcini he suggested that 
the judge be investigated for possible negligence or misconduct 
thompson had no comment on mrs limpys testimony conerning 
delays in the case 
however a statement issued by bob dennis court clerk for the 
western district of oklahoma said counsel for both sides have 
reported to the court that settlement offers have been ongoing 
while they watched an almost identical case pending in new 
mexico 
the statement said the new mexico case settled by an entry of 
consent decree in march and that both parties in mrs limpys case 
filed a status report last month that specific settlement offers 
were forthcoming and that the parties would report on their 
progress in july 
the court said they waited on the new mexico case to avoid a 
potential conflict in rulings to avoid delays in possible appeals 
and to enhance the prospects of an agreed settlement in the 
case 
in oklahoma indians have been allotted land by federal 
treaties when that land includes oil property the federal 
government is responsible for making sure the indians get their 
share of the royalties 
the government supplies an explanation of payment that is 
supposed to help the allottees understand the condition of the well 
and why the check is for a certain amount 
every witness that appeared before the committee friday said the 
forms are nearly impossible to understand 
houston and velma decker a caddo indian couple living in 
oklahoma said they have been trying since march 1988 to find out 
why their checks suddenly dropped in amount 
neither the bia nor the minerals management service has given 
them an answer despite repeated inquiries they said 
i have allottees that come in everyday said ken young of a 
bia office in utah theres no way they can understand the 
forms 
he said he thought the government bureaucracy should be 
elminated and the oil companies should pay the allottees directly

prime minister yitzhak shamir on friday 
scheduled the first political tests of his election plan for the 
occupied lands arab doctors said israeli troops shot and killed a 
24yearold palestinian 
at least 10 other palestinians were wounded in confrontations 
between soldiers and stonethrowers in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip arab reports said 
shamir called meetings for saturday and sunday to consider 
guidelines for the elections the first with cabinet ministers of 
his rightwing likud bloc and the second with the full cabinet 
including members of the leftleaning labor party 
shamirs proposal to end the 17month rebellion in the occupied 
lands involves elections to choose palestinian representatives who 
would negotiate with israel for limited autonomy talks would 
follow three years later on a permanent settlement 
when it meets sunday the 25member government likely will 
sidestep controversial issues such as the participation of 
palestinians from outside the territories a palestinian demand 
reportedly supported by the united states 
what we are bringing are the main principles the skeleton of 
the plan without getting into details said a shamir aide who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the meetings come during a weekend visit by us officials who 
are expected to press shamir for specifics such as whether 140000 
palestinians living in east jerusalem will be able to vote and 
whether there will be international supervision 
both radio moscow and the abu dhabi newspaper al ittihad 
reported that palestine liberation organization chief yasser arafat 
will accept the elections if they are held under international 
supervision 
shamir introduced his idea for elections last month at a meeting 
with president bush following criticism of israels handling of the 
uprising 
since then palestinians in the occupied territories and the 
plo which is outlawed here have rejected the elections 
clashes occur daily on friday five confrontations erupted in 
the gaza strip and one in the west bank town of el bireh just 
north of jerusalem 
the worst confrontation was in gaza city the seaside strips 
largest town where troops opened fire on stonethrowing youths 
killing mahmoud awad akraa and wounding six others arab hospital 
officials said 
a military spokesman confirmed akraas death but said a 
preliminary report showed no troops were in the area at the time of 
the alleged confrontation 
he said the army was continuing its investigation into the death 
the death would raise to at least 472 the number of palestinians 
killed since they started rebelling against israeli occupation in 
december 1987 twentyone israelis also have died 
the gaza clashes occurred despite a curfew that confined the 
strips 700000 residents to their homes for a fifth day 
in the west bank town of nablus troops shot and wounded two 
palestinians including a 15yearold 
in israel just north of gaza israelis stoned arabowned cars 
for a second day to protest the killing of one soldier in the area 
and the disappearance of another soldier police have blamed 
palestinians 
the incidents and the murder of two israelis by a palestinian in 
jerusalem last week have raised rightwing opposition to shamirs 
election plan 
among opponents is trade minister ariel sharon who says they 
will bring disaster 
the plan will not bring peace but a plo palestinian state 
terror and war and the redivision of jerusalem he told yediot 
ahronot newspaper 
most likud ministers are expected to approve and ministers of 
the labor party already approved the plan thursday 
after sundays meeting shamir will meet with dennis ross a 
senior aide to secretary of state james baker iii ross arrives 
saturday night to brief israeli leaders on bakers talks in moscow 
with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
ross also is expected to meet palestinian leaders he reportedly 
is trying to make the election plan more attractive to them by 
urging israel to allow arabs in east jerusalem to vote a concept 
opposed by shamir but favored by labor party leaders 
east jerusalem was captured from jordan in the 1967 middle east 
war and annexed into the israeli capital

a witness in the house ethics committees 
probe of speaker jim wright charged friday that the panel had 
unfairly threatened him for attempting to correct what he saw as a 
misleading account of his testimony 
when mr payte attempted to correct the record you used the 
power of your committee to attempt to silence him wrote preston 
m geren iii an attorney for fort worth real estate developer s 
gene payte in a letter to the ethics panel 
payte had testified before the panel last oct 17 and told of 
his efforts to give money to wright because he appreciated the 
speakers work in congress wright declined the gift and payte 
then sought to buy copies of wrights book reflections of a 
public man to show his appreciation 
according to the report of special ethics committee counsel 
richard j phelan payte then paid a total of 6000 intended 
partly to help revise and update the book and to pay for 1000 
copies 
the report states that although he was equivocal on the point 
in his testimony payte testified that he only received between 300 
and 500 copies of the old book for his 6000 and would still 
like to receive the new books 
apparently based on that testimony the ethics committee deemed 
the money for the undelivered books an improper gift to wright and 
added that to its formal charges against the speaker 
payte later disputed the account of his testimony issuing a 
public affidavit last month that contended the reference to 300 to 
500 books came in a question from rep john t myers of indiana 
the committees ranking republican and that he had said several 
times he received all 1000 books he paid for 
on friday payte released a copy of a may 5 letter he received 
from the ethics panel reminding him of a gag order on committee 
witnesses 
your affidavit represents a course of conduct in direct 
violation of the admonition given to you the letter stated 
accordingly we wish to notify you that the matter of your 
violation may be taken up by the committee 
payte was very disturbed and when he got over being 
disturbed was very angry at the letter geren said he sees it 
as an effort by the committee to make him keep quiet an effort to 
bluff him into silence 
he said paytes affidavit addressed only matters that already 
were public because they were included in the ethics committees 
published report 
committee chairman julian dixon dcalif said the letter in 
no way was intended as a threat but was a reminder that 
witnesses are not to discuss testimony given in private 
if he felt his testimony had been characterized unfairly the 
first people he should talk to is the committee dixon said 
adding that he was unaware of any effort by payte to do so

portauprince haiti ap the independent electoral council 
said friday there will not be any election soon because 
electionday massacres in 1987 left haitians with no confidence in 
the democratic process 
no election date has been set and haitis military ruler lt 
gen prosper avril said late last year there would be no elections 
for at least two years 
several political leaders have called for elections by the end 
of this year 
citizens are not mobilized for elections now we have to 
regain their confidence in the democratic process which was lost 
after the aborted elections of nov 29 1987 said the electoral 
council secretarygeneral jeangerard pierre 
on that date thugs protected by soldiers attacked voters at 
polling stations killing at least 34 people the elections which 
would have been the first free balloting in haiti in more than 30 
years were canceled by the ruling council of lt gen henri namphy 
namphy came to power after dictator jeanclaude duvalier fled to 
france in 1986 during uprisings against his regime namphy was 
ousted last september in a coup by soldiers who accused the 
government of statesponsored violence and demanded a return to 
democracy 
the electoral council has nine members appointed by institutions 
including the roman catholic church the news media and human 
rights groups 
if elections are held in a hurry they will be a farce people 
do not yet have faith in avrils will or ability to lead the 
country towards democracy said jeanclaude roy technical 
adviser to a previous electoral council dissolved by namphy hours 
after the electionday killings in 1987 
troops loyal to avril blocked an attempted coup by some military 
officers on april 2 and the ringleaders were sent into exile

the head of the house investigations 
subcommittee said friday an fda inspection of a new jersey drug 
manufacturing plant appeared to be an attempt to retaliate against 
the firm for testifying against the agency 
rep john dingell dmich asked the food and drug 
administration to explain the thursday inspection of the barr 
laboratories plant which began about the time barr executives 
were concluding their testimony before dingells panel 
the committee is of the tentative view that there is an 
attempt here to coerce harass intimidate or retaliate against the 
persons who cooperated in the investigation he said 
the pomona nybased barr laboratories was informed by the fda 
on thursday night the inspection had been suspended pending an 
internal review according to the companys attorney h lawrence 
fox 
the head of mylan laboratories in pittsburgh told the 
subcommittee at thursdays hearing the fda was holding up approvals 
on some of the companys products in retaliation for mylan having 
started the investigation into alleged bribery and other corruption 
at the agencys generic drug division 
mylans complaints about discriminatory and arbitrary treatment 
by the division sparked an inquiry by the house energy and commerce 
investigations subcommittee a year ago the panel turned over its 
evidence to the us attorneys office in baltimore though it is 
continuing its investigation 
two fda employees and a drug company executive have been charged 
in the case and more arrests are expected 
fda spokesman jeff nesbit said that due to the generics 
investigation fda conducted a retrospective review of generic 
products and manufacturing sites to be sure that no product was 
released that was unsafe 
we had no idea when this project was started weeks ago that an 
inspection of barr labs would begin on the same day as the hearing 
as soon as we found out about the inspection we called it off 
he said 
investigators have said they have found no evidence that any 
unsafe or ineffective drugs were put on the market as a result of 
the alleged improprieties 
dingell said thursday he would not tolerate reprisals against 
any of the companies or individuals cooperating with his panel 
later the same day acting fda deputy commissioner james benson 
wrote dingell assuring him there would be no retaliation benson 
also sent a memo to division employees warning against even the 
appearance of retaliatory action 
fox said the company was last inspected nine months ago and that 
the fda had found nothing wrong and the company has had no recalls 
since then in such circumstances he said inspections usually 
occur at twoyear intervals 
it isnt real difficult to look back and see the last 
inspection wasnt two years ago fox said

dustin hoffman and other stars friday urged the 
government to halt a new office project on the remains of a 16th 
century theater where shakespeare once acted 
in a letter to the newspaper the independent hoffman and 15 
actors and directors called for the site of the rose theater to be 
designated an ancient monument to ensure its preservation 
without the designation the recently discovered remains will be 
irrevocably damaged by the construction work due to start monday 
they said the remains include part of the stage and collapsed 
walls of the elizabethan theater where shakespeare acted in 1592 
as a lastditch attempt to save the remains of the rose 
theater from destruction we appeal to the secretary of state for 
the environment nicholas ridley to schedule the site as an 
ancient monument immediately after monday it will be too late 
later friday the development company involved said the remains 
of the rose theater would be protected and preserved beneath the 
building with minimal damage but the royal shakespeare company 
said the assurances did not go far enough 
several actors said they still intended to go to the site in 
protest on sunday and that ian mckellen and dame peggy ashcroft 
would read from shakespeares henry vi the first play 
performed at the rose 
ridley who opened an office building in southampton on friday 
said i havent decided what to do when i have decided i will 
make an announcement 
in addition to hoffman the signatories included simon callow 
dame judi dench james fox peter hall and tim pigottsmith 
hoffman winner of this years best actor oscar for the film 
rain man is in britain to play shylock in a stage production 
of shakespeares the merchant of venice later this month 
in a letter friday to the times of london lord olivier dame 
peggy ashcroft and eight others wrote plans for the office block 
show the area peppered with concrete piles one is to be placed 
centerstage a stage on which christopher marlowe shakespeare 
and ben jonson trod 
surely the secretary of state ridley should intervene to 
prevent building from proceeding and to save the entire rose 
theater site for the nation 
prime minister margaret thatcher on thursday told the house of 
commons that everything possible will be done to preserve the 
theater 
there have been very constructive discussions between the 
developers english heritage a body that preserves historic sites 
and the museum of london with the result that the remains are 
going to be preserved with the minimum of damage 
imry merchant developers said thursday the remains are going 
to be wrapped as carefully as a porcelain doll there must be a 
building over the top of it and to protect the rose there has to be 
a protective covering for it 
but harvey sheldon the archaeologist who led museum of london 
excavations at the site later said parts of the stage walls will 
be demolished so that the piles for the new building can be driven 
through it 
museum experts located and uncovered the remains of the theater 
after an office building was demolished in december 
american actorproducer sam wanamaker has called the rose the 
20th centurys most important discovery regarding the cradle of 
the great elizabethan theater 
the museum excavations suggest that the theater originally 
thought to have been octagonal had 17 or 18 sides or was 
elliptical 
records show it was demolished not long after shakespeare acted 
there the chalk foundations lie 6 feet below the modern surface 
the excavations have unearthed thousands of hazelnut shells 
the elizabethan equivalent of popcorn clay pipes dating from 
1580 sheep bones and large numbers of oyster shells

exxon and government scientists said 
friday they plan to testspray an oily island beach with powerful 
sludgethinning chemicals because weeks of scouring have failed to 
clean alaskas oily shores 
oil industry executives also announced that they have renewed 
the 15000aday contract for the soviet vessel vaidogubsky a 
stateoftheart oil skimmer that will be on standby near the 
entrance of prince william sound as a backup in case of spills 
the use of chemical oil thinners or dispersants drew immediate 
criticism from the environmental group greenpeace 
it creates more of a hazard than its worth said cindy 
lowry a greenpeace spokeswoman right now it seems a pretty 
risky thing to try there are so many important pupping areas for 
harbor seals this is not the right time to do it i dont think 
they are that controlled either 
exxon under the orders of coast guard vice adm clyde robbins 
is developing a plan to test the dispersants on ingot island beach 
a heavily fouled area of prince william sound scientists hope to 
thin the taffylike crude enough to float it away in the current 
then allow it to decompose naturally in some areas the oil has 
the consistency of asphalt 
robbins said other land cleanup methods including hot and 
coldwater washing of the rocky shores had proven futile im 
not hot on dispersants but i think weve got to look at it said 
robbins the onsite commander of the oil cleanup 
earlier testing of dispersants proved inconclusive shortly after 
the oil spill march 24 when the exxon valdez tanker slammed into 
bligh reef and poured about 109 million gallons of crude through 
its ripped hull 
the national transportation safety board has scheduled hearings 
next week in anchorage to investigate the cause of the accident 
the fired skipper of the tanker joseph hazelwood 42 of 
huntington ny faces trial june 20 in valdez on charges that 
include operating the vessel while intoxicated 
the 11400ton 450footlong vaidogubsky was involved in the 
oil cleanup under a monthlong contract with exxon but the ships 
hightech pumping and dredging equipment frequently jammed on the 
hardened crude or mousse formed by buffeting from winds and 
waves and exxon did not renew the contract 
but alyeska pipeline service co the oil industrys jointly 
owned company that manages the transalaska oil pipeline hired the 
ship through the end of may as standby backup said alyeska 
spokesman tom brennan it will be assigned to the tanker waiting 
area south of valdez when tankers cant come directly into port 
because of heavy traffic they wait out there 
he said the vessel would provide extra protection in case of 
another spill 
exxon has proposed cleaning some 364 miles of shore inside 
prince william sound and southwest from valdez along the alaska 
coast the company which has spent about 100 million on the 
cleanup to date said it will have 5000 beach cleanup workers in 
place by midsummer 
much of the oil that has reached land has been pounded into the 
shore by wave and tide action robbins said and the buried crude 
does not dissipate 
the oil trapped in the subsurface is not weathering at all 
he said 
the alaska department of environmental conservation said the 
methods used to clean the beaches to date are not efficient at 
removing this oil which is trapped in the soil or trapped 
within the shoreline sediment more effective methods need to be 
used 
legislation creating a state commission to investigate the exxon 
valdez spill and to increase spill fines to up to 50 a gallon were 
signed into law friday by gov steve cowper he also signed a bill 
that imposes stricter liability laws on companies responsible for 
ol and hazardous material spills 
the spill bills were the first to become law since the exxon 
valdez ran aground 
these new laws are a first step in making sure another exxon 
valdez incident never happens cowper said in a news release 
they also send a signal to the oil industry that its going to 
have to improve its performance or face some serious consequences

under us prodding the world health organization 
on friday shelved until next year a decision on whether to admit 
the plos selfdeclared state of palestine as its 167th member 
the state department in washington hailed the action saying the 
organization rejected the plos efforts to politicize whos 
important work 
the vote dashed plo hopes of winning voting rights in all major 
un agencies this year after its legislature in tunis the capital 
of tunisia last november proclaimed the state of palestine 
the who annual assembly voted 8347 in a secret ballot in favor 
of a resolution cosponsored by nine western and third world 
countries it coupled the deferral with a call for more aid to 
residents of israelioccupied lands where a palestinian uprising 
began 17 months ago twenty members abstained 
the soviet union joined in supporting the resolution soviet 
health minister ei chazov told the assembly earlier that moscow 
wanted to find a solution avoiding confrontation 
dr fathi arafat head of the palestine liberation organization 
observer delegation and the physician brother of plo chairman 
yasser arafat said the resolution means you will all stand 
behind us next year you will all vote so that we may assume our 
role of peace in all the international organizations 
earlier the meeting refused to consider nicaraguan amendments 
that would have effectively turned the proposal into a call for the 
plos immediate admission 
the voting followed more than four hours of procedural wrangling 
nearly 100 countries have recognized the state of palestine or 
at least acknowledged its proclamation 
israel objected to fridays resolution in an official statement 
released in jerusalem moments after the vote the foreign ministry 
said deferring the decision to admit the plo poses an obstacle to 
peace in our region 
there is no place for this terrorist organization among the 
members of this humanitarian organization it said 
the united states which is contributing 74 million or 25 
percent to the whos regular budget in 1989 threatened to 
withdraw all payments to any un agency admitting the plo as a 
full member 
thirtyeight senators led by robert w kasten jr rwis wrote 
a letter last month to secretary of states james a baker iii 
vowing they would seek such cuts in us contributions 
in washington kasten hailed fridays vote as a very 
significant defeat for the plo more importantly it shows what 
we can accomplish with a unified and bipartisan approach to foreign 
policy with the executive and legislative branches working hand in 
hand 
baker joined by all western nations argued that the 
selfproclaimed new entity did not fullfill internationally 
accepted criteria of statehood including control of a defined 
territory 
he said plo admission would harm the middle east peace process 
and the entire un system 
the state department issued a statement saying the bush 
administration reaffirms us support for the who and its 
global healthimprovement programs while adding that washington 
also will continue to oppose any change in the nonvoting observer 
status of the plo in the who or any other un bodies 
all 21 arab countries backed the plos application 
who director general hiroshi nakajima a japanese physician had 
pleaded in vain with yasser araft to withdraw his application for 
membership or at least put it off until the next assembly nakajima 
said a cutoff of us funds would completely destroy the agency 
hours before the debate started the plo said it would help 
finance the whos african operations in case of a withdrawal of 
us funds it said it raised the money from arab countries 
nakajima told the assembly again that whos survival was at 
stake 
let us do nothing that would jeopardize the future of our 
organization he told the more than 1000 delegates crowding the 
assembly hall of the palais des nations the un office in geneva 
the world health organization a specialized un agency began 
operating in 1948 with its declared purpose to aid in the 
attainment by all peoples of the highest possible levels of

secretary of state james a baker iii failed 
friday to heal a rift with west germany over nuclear missiles 
leaving a shadow over the may 2930 summit president bush will 
attend with other western leaders 
if we had bridged the gap i would tell you baker said after 
he met with west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher he 
said the security of the north atlantic treaty organization could 
be at risk if the allies let their nuclear defenses down 
meanwhile officials of the 15 other nato nations welcomed in 
guarded terms soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs proposal to 
unilaterally cut 500 shortrange nuclear weapons baker said it was 
merely a soviet public relations ploy and bushs national security 
adviser said it was designed to split nato 
brent scowcroft speaking with reporters aboard air force one as 
bush flew to texas for a speech said the soviet proposal is 
designed principally to create problems within the alliance 
divisions within the western alliance 
the nato officials in a statement after baker briefed them on 
his trip earlier this week to moscow said we consider reduction 
in 500 weapons alone as a welcome positive but rather modest 
step the statement said nato looks to moscow for further 
reductions in its unwarranted superiority 
the bush administrations dispute with west germany is over 
shortrange nuclear missiles targeted against the sovietled warsaw 
pact countries mostly from sites on west german soil west germany 
wants to delay a proposal to triple the range of the missiles and 
to increase their speed asking instead that the united states 
begin to negotiate shortrange missile cutbacks on both sides with 
the soviet union 
the dispute has opened fissures within the alliance a majority 
supports west germany in a position that baker suggested was 
partially motivated by politics 
disarmament feeling is strong in west germany and chancellor 
helmut kohls decision to oppose modernizing the lance missiles and 
to urge negotiations is viewed as a way of trying to improve his 
chances for reelection next year 
gorbachev complicated bakers task with an announcement thursday 
that the soviets would withdraw 500 nuclear missiles bombs and 
artillery shells from eastern europe this year 
he alo advised baker in a 3hour kremlin meeting that the 
warsaw pact would propose at eastwest talks in vienna wideranging 
cutbacks in troops tanks artillery and other nonnuclear forces 
baker said the unilateral withdrawal of about 5 percent of the 
soviet shortrange nuclear arsenal was quite apparently designed 
for public opinion and included no guarantee the missiles would 
be destroyed 
he said the pullout would have only a modest impact on the 
easts edge in nuclear weapons in europe and that he did not intend 
to play a public relations game with gorbachev 
the allies should approach arms reduction moves with prudence 
and realism baker said 
he said that while us differences with west germany posed 
political problems what would be a worse disaster is if we let 
domestic politics endanger the security of the alliance 
after their discussion genscher said that while the lance 
modernization issue was no closer to agreement it was not the 
aim of this meeting to make progress 
baker said that after a full exchange on the issue he hoped 
genscher better understands our position he said he was still 
hopeful for a settlement before the nato meeting in two weeks 
he also met friday with dutch foreign minister hans van den 
broek whose country is one of several nato members trying to 
mediate in the modernization debate 
the dutch official said he had good hope the issue will be 
resolved and didnt think gorbachevs proposal will have a direct 
influence 
nato estimates the soviet union has 1450 shortrange nuclear 
missile launchers in europe against 88 for the western alliance 
that imbalance as well as a warsaw pact superiority in 
conventional weapons is a main reason the united states and 
britain reject talks on battlefield nuclear arms 
west germany and other allies want to put off modernization of 
the lance missiles until the early 1990s and to begin reduction 
talks on the battlefied weapons quickly they argue the eastwest 
climate has improved enough in recent years to bring such talks to 
a positive conclusion 
though officials of the nato countries dont want the dispute to 
mar the summit ostensibly designed to celebrate natos 40th 
birthday baker gave no indication the united states would give in 
just to clear the air 
it is a very very important issue involving as it does 
questions of alliance security he said 
british foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe in perth scotland 
for a conservative party conference supported the us position 
he said the 500 warheads represent only a small proportion 
of the soviets stockpile and gorbachevs action did not undermine 
the case for modernizing natos shortrange missile system 
howe was asked if he thought gorbachev was trying to split nato 
and he replied i think its characteristic of mr gorbachevs 
position that he always tries to remove one of his many veils 
of armor before a nato meeting 
but he added i think there is serious arms control business 
to be done and we welcome his response to our longstanding 
positions

a jury found friday that goddard college 
discriminated against a black woman by barring her from a 
conference on racism 
the jury awarded patricia lewis 102000 in damages 
i think the fact that it was an allwhite jury didnt 
matter said neil mickenberg one of lewis attorneys we 
proved our case 
lewis 27 sued the college alleging she was barred from a 
threesession workshop on racism which was targeted at white 
women she said the incident caused her such turmoil as a student 
that she had to leave school and has been unable to return 
what we have here is a much more modern form of racial 
discrimination that doesnt break your bones doesnt leave 
scars said frank kochman an attorney for lewis during fridays 
closing arguments all it does is enter your mind and eat up your 
soul 
the lawsuit sought 175000 in damages for her lost wages as a 
teacher which was her initial career goal and for emotional 
distress 
i left goddard college because i was discriminated against 
lewis testified thursday 
but a lawyer for goddard charles hurt contended in closing 
arguments friday that the case was not related to racial 
discrimination and that lewis left school for reasons other than 
the conference 
its hard to believe that that would be enough to drop out of 
school and interrupt her career that was so important to her 
hurt said suggesting that while lewis may have been upset it 
didnt make her leave school 
hurt could not be reached for comment immediately following the 
verdict 
goddard a small private alternative school in plainfield 
works hard to educate its students against racism which was one 
reason for the conference he said 
during the fourday trial jurors heard from faculty and staff 
at the college as well as lewis psychologist and other experts 
who testified about the feelings and experiences of black students 
on predominately white campuses when the incident occurred in 
1984 lewis was one of three black students at goddard fewer than 
1500 blacks live in vermont 
kochman also argued that goddard had admitted discrimination in 
various letters after the incident and in its original response to 
the lawsuit 
what are they apologizing for if they didnt do anything 
wrong nobody does that kochman said urging jurors to review 
letters from college president jack lindquist and others involved 
in his instructions judge matthew katz said jurors must first 
determine whether lewis was excluded from the conference and 
second whether that caused her harm 
nicola morris the goddard faculty adviser running the 
conference moon over vermont testified during the trial that 
lewis expressed concern at the time that the group was somehow 
being ku klux klan 
morris also said that she initially invited the sophomore to 
participate in either the workshops or the planning it is 
absolutely clear in my mind that she did not want to be included in 
the antiracism conference she said 
but lewis testified morris never invited me to the 
conference she said morris asked her to leave when she had 
confronted members attending the final workshop

newspaper received a letter in which her husband allegedly 
confessed to killing her because she didnt understand his 
premonitions and said he left a list of 54 people who will be 
punished 
last friday night i shot and killed my wife began the 
fivepage letter allegedly from david schoenecker 48 that was 
received thursday by orange county register columnist bob emmers 
schoenecker was arrested by a montana sheriff friday afternoon 
wandering in the clearwater national forest just inside the idaho 
border he was carrying a 357caliber magnum revolver but did not 
resist authorities said 
there was no hatred i loved her but the action was 
necessary because i have a purpose and one that cannot have an 
interruption or interference the letter said 
gail reasoned only in black and white or good and bad she 
never dealt in the grey or devious world a world where i now 
totally exist it said 
the letter dated monday and handwritten on stationery from a 
missoula mont travelodge said there was a possibility that the 
body of gail m schoenecker 40 had not been discovered the 
writer included the couples address and advised emmers to contact 
authorities 
i never got anything like it before it gave me the chills 
emmers said 
police sgt chet barry said friday that police had confirmed 
that the body they found thursday afternoon in the schoeneckers 
home was that of mrs schoenecker an elementary school teacher 
the cause of death had not been determined he said 
schoenecker had been seen sunday when he checked into the 
travelodge and apparently spent the night his car was found 
abandoned tuesday in the lolo national forest about 60 miles west 
of missoula and cabins in the area were searched mineral county 
sheriff wade van gilder said 
van gilder flew by helicopter over the rugged bitterroot 
mountains to drop ahead of schoenecker in the clearwater forest 
then walked back to meet him said montana highway patrol officer 
rick seemann 
schoenecker had followed a natural course from the cedar creek 
drainage where he left his car into another drainage and then over 
hoodoo pass into idaho seemann said he wasnt sure where he was 
headed seemann said 
the area has many homes and mining claims and is served by a 
welltraveled road so schoenecker had been reported several times 
on his trek seemann said 
mineral county deputies were notified friday by anaheim police 
that schoenecker bought camping gear in missoula probably on 
monday a sheriffs spokesman said 
investigators didnt know exactly what he bought or where or 
whether he has outdoor skills anaheim police would not say how 
they learned of the purchase 
the letter said schoenecker killed his wife because she didnt 
understand the premonitions and images he had about people who 
had done wrong or evil against him 
several times i tried to explain these happenings to gail 
my wife but she dismissed them i was never understood i knew 
that as these feelings and pictures continued to occur and repeat 
that i had to prepare a way develope a plan make arrangements 
and i have done so 
now i had to eliminate my wife she wouldnt believe me she 
wouldnt even listen so in order to keep her from finding out i 
developed a separate plan or storyline that totally misled her but 
it did make her happy she was very happy on friday 
gail suspected that we were missing a great deal of money she 
also was upset about several of my trips recently she started to 
figure that i must be doing something else with my time and our 
money 
the letter suggested that the chemical engineer may intend to 
kill other people 
ive left a list a partial list not everyone on the list 
will receive total punishment but they will be punished the 
letter said the images in my mind shows me exactly how and when 
and where the punishment will be delivered it has to be done 
police searched the couples home and found a list of 54 people 
the majority of whom live in the milwaukee area 
anaheim police had contacted about 75 percent of the people 
named on the list barry said several of those listed had gone to 
custer high school in milwaukee with schoenecker lt marc hedgpeth 
said his wife also was from milwaukee 
schoeneckers exwife kathy schoenecker was on the list they 
were divorced in 1977 her current husband said by telephone from 
milwaukee that his wife was shaken she and schoenecker had two 
daughters police said friday they didnt know the whereabouts of 
the women terry 20 and tracy 22 
he is absolutely not a violent person the former mrs 
schoenecker said in a brief telephone interview with the milwaukee 
journal which did not give her present last name 
schoenecker was senior class president of custer high school and 
the 1959 yearbook recounts a 55yard touchdown run he made in a key 
football game

the dispute between the united states and 
panamanian strongman manuel antonio noriega should be settled 
through the organization of american states four former us 
ambassadors to the united nations agreed friday 
going to the oas would allow an opportunity for countries of 
the hemisphere to react said donald mchenry who served in the 
united nations under former president carter this is the same 
course the us followed in persuading former dictator anastasio 
somoza to leave nicaragua 
a un role at this point would only confuse and complicate 
the situation agreed john scali who served in the world 
organization under former president nixon 
the two were joined by andrew young who also was un 
ambassador under carter and arthur goldberg who was lyndon 
johnsons un envoy the four held a news conference prior to 
taping of a panel discussion on the united nations for the southern 
center for international studies 
president bush announced thursday that he was sending nearly 
2000 additional combat troops into panama to protect american 
citizens from the violence that erupted in the aftermath of 
noriegas decision wednesday to annul the results of panamas 
presidential election 
scali rated bushs handling of the panamanian situation a 9 out 
of 10 adding i think mr bush is far more cautious than 
president reagan and far more conscious of the need to bring 
congress along with him as an ally 
hes doing a fairly good job said goldberg but he added 
i dont know why we are sending about 2000 more troops there we 
have about 10000 there 
there must be diplomatic efforts to join in condemning this 
horrible business that noriega has entered into he ought to be 
condemned by the international community beginning with the latin 
american states goldberg said 
scali called the sending of additional troops a message a 
signal to the panamanian people they are not alone against what 
he called the savage brutality of the noriega leadership 
settling the dispute is the very thing oas is best expected to 
do said young who is now atlantas mayor its better that 
whatever suggestions are made come from the latin americans 
themselves and the united states not be the one to come up with the 
plan 
mchenry said he believes there is no danger to americans living 
in panama and troops sent there will not find themselves in combat 
with panamanian defense forces

more than a quarter of the lakes studied in 
upstate new yorks adirondack mountains are so acidic that they 
contain no or very few fish concludes a study on the effects of 
acid rain that was released friday 
shallow lakes in the southwestern adirondacks are the most 
susceptible to high acidity according to the study by the 
adirondack lakes survey corp a company formed by utilities and 
state environmental officials 
the survey of 1723 lakes mostly in the adirondacks is the 
most comprehensive work ever done by a state to examine the effects 
of acid rain said james mahoney director of the federal acid 
precipitation assessment program which hopes to finish a 10year 
study on acid rain next year 
this whole acid rain phenomenon is so complicated that its a 
great help when you see a big mess of data that confirms your 
natural speculations mahoney said 
much of the contamination of new york state lakes can be traced 
to sulfur dioxide emitted from factories in the midwest and borne 
by prevailing wind to the north and east said charles driscoll a 
civil engineering professor at syracuse university 
but since many lakes in the adirondacks are naturally acidic 
its premature to conclude that the blame for all the damage can be 
traced to midwest factories driscoll said 
of the 1469 lakes surveyed in the adirondacks investigators 
found no fish in 346 and fewer than 10 fish in 79 thats 29 
percent of the total 
the survey found that 352 or 24 percent of the adirondack 
lakes studied had ph levels of 5 or below the ph level is a 
measurement of acidity anything below 5 is considered unlikely to 
support life 
but in the southwestern adirondacks 40 percent of the lakes 
have ph levels of 5 or below the survey found more than 60 percent 
of the lakes with no fish in upstate new york are in this region 
if you look at these lakes the ones that are acidic they 
are very small lakes very shallow lakes driscoll said 
environmentalists had some good news the survey examined 254 
lakes in new yorks lower hudson river valley and catskill 
mountains south of the adirondacks and found only 3 percent with 
ph levels of 5 or below 
generally the conditions there are excellent said walter 
kretser project manager of the survey 
and a related continuing study of 17 adirondack lakes thats 
been underway since 1982 shows that the level of sulfur dioxide in 
the air has been declining consistent with national air pollution 
trends but driscoll said these improvements have yet to be 
reflected in the lakes

the environmental protection agency proposed 
friday to bar two missouri plants of a defense contractor from 
receiving any future federal funds because of alleged water 
pollution violations 
the epa said its move is part of a crackdown on industrial 
polluters it was the first time the agency has started an 
enforcement action under the clean water act to cut off federal 
funds to government contractors for allegedly failing to comply 
with pollution standards 
targeted were two joplin mo plants of eaglepicher industries 
inc an ohiobased company that makes batteries for defense 
aerospace and automotive industries 
the epa alleges that the plants have discharged untreated waste 
water into a creek and dumped toxic wastes including mercury 
cadmium and chromium into the citys sewer system in excess of 
federal limits 
the agency filed a lawsuit in federal court in missouri against 
the plants in october 1987 alleging the water pollution violations 
company officials in joplin and at the cincinnati ohio office 
of eaglepicher would not comment on epas proposed action or 
whether the company will seek a hearing to contest it 
if epa implements the sanction it would not invalidate existing 
government contracts of the two plants or halt the flow of money 
under them according to dave ryan an epa spokesman 
however those contracts could not be renewed and the two 
plants would be barred from receiving any future federal money

the united states on friday told a unsponsored 
meeting of experts dealing with climate changes that washington now 
backed negotiations on a treaty to check the greenhouse effect a 
un official reported 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
united states announced it wanted to play a leading part in shaping 
a coordinated strategy to combat global warming caused by solar 
heat trapped under gases in the atmosphere 
he said washington now strongly backs un initiatives designed 
to lead to an international convention previously according to 
the official the united states had been not among the major 
supporters 
the meeting in geneva concluded friday it was held under the 
auspices of the un environment program and the world 
meteorological organization as part of an 18 monthstudy of 
climatic changes the experts will publish their recommendations

president nicolae ceausescu of romania on 
friday strongly attacked reforms in the soviet bloc and made plain 
he did not intend to adopt similar policies a report from the 
state news agency agerpres said 
the report monitored in vienna indicated that ceausescu did 
not name the soviet union hungary or poland as countries adopting 
farreaching reforms of the stalinist system 
but agerpres quoted the leader of communist romania as telling 
communist party members friday in drobetaturnu severin on the 
yugoslav border 
i would like to tell some circles abroad which try to minimize 
the realities of socialism that romania through everything it 
has achieved proves there can be no way back that in no way can 
the wonderful industrial agricultural social constructions be 
privatized to resort to a set phrase very much used today which 
actually means a return to capitalism 
for romania capitalism fell forever there is only one way 
to advance on the revolutionary path of the communist party toward 
socialism toward communism 
the building of communism cannot be achieved through 
reformism but through revolutionary fight 
the ruling communist parties have adopted reforms in the soviet 
union poland and hungary that grant the private economy some role 
in the overall national economy 
bulgaria also has gone some way to reform its centrally planned 
economy 
but in romania east germany and czechoslovakia the communist 
leaderships have either rejected the need for change or adopted 
cautious economic reforms 
ceausescu is to visit czechoslovakia within days according to 
pragues staterun media his visit follows closely a trip to 
prague by east german leader erich honecker that ended with 
declarations of unity on both sides 
elsewhere in his speech ceausescu was quoted as saying he 
advocates a speedy reduction of shortrange nuclear weapons in 
europe and wants talks for complete abolition of such weapons 
the west german news magazine der spiegel said this week that 
romania now has the ability to make mediumrange nuclear rockets 
through the sale of western missile launcher technology 
ceausescu said last month that romania can make nuclear arms but 
has not done so out of concern for world peace 
some western analysts doubt the claim since romania is still 
apparently unable to complete its first nuclear power plant at 
cernavoda on the danube river most technology for the plant was 
imported from the west

parliament reconvene on may 18 when the committee was to submit a 
report on the scandal involving fugitive banker george koskotas 
under the closure order parliament cannot be reconvened 
we have to decide that with the closure of parliament our 
committee ceases to function since whatever action we take has no 
substance said dimitris pagoropoulos chairman of the 30member 
panel he is a member of papandreous panhellenic socialist 
movement which dominated the committee 
new democracy deputy dyonisios bouloukos a committee member

fled greece after being indicted in a 200 million fraud forgery 
and embezzlement scandal 
he was arrested in the united states and is jailed in salem 
mass awaiting an extradition hearing 
in interviews at the jail koskotas claimed papandreou and other 
officials in his party received millions of dollars in payoffs and 
authorized the looting of the bank of crete while koskotas was its 
chairman 
many people mentioned by koskotas had been questioned by the 
committee 
in another development a man accused of receiving money stolen 
from the bank of crete was released on bail friday for health 
reasons according to a court official 
he said george louvaris a close friend of papandreou submitted 
bail of 330000 he was released on the conditions he not leave 
the country and that he report to a police station every 10 days 
louvaris was jailed april 12 and is awaiting trial shorty after 
his imprisonment he was transferred to an athens hospital for 
treatment of multiple sclerosis

after three of koskotas former bodyguards testified that they had 
delivered boxes of money to louvaris at his athens home 
koskotas in interviews in the united states claimed louvaris 
was a middleman for payoffs to socialist officials 
louvaris and papandreou have denied any involvement in the bank 
scandal

and the army followed friday when the united states beefed up its 
forces here to show its displeasure with the regime of gen manuel 
antonio noriega 
there was no official reaction from noriega whom the u s 
government and international obervers accused of annulling the 
presidential election rather than let the opposition win 
fifty marines of the 2nd light armored infantry company from 
camp lejeune nc with their eightwheel armored vehicles were 
the first to touch down at this base on the outskirts of panama 
city 
they were followed by planeloads of army soldiers from the 7th 
infantry division at fort ord calif and the us army 5th 
infantry division at fort polk la 
seventyone planes with nearly 1900 men and their equipment 
were expected to land over a 30hour period 
the first planes were a few minutes late and an officer on the 
tarmac remarked that mac the military airlift command also means 
maybe airplane come 
the c141 starlifter and c5 galaxy jets started landing at 
howard shortly after 1 pm on a typical humid sunny panamanian 
afternoon the marines came through a side door and their 
ammunition and other equipment rolled off the planes rear doors in 
large boxes 
the marines picked up their gear and rifles slung marched 
inside to be assigned to what were described as field areas 
throughout the military installations 
most of them will be living in tents a southern command 
spokesman said 
some marines smiled at journalists and waved glad to be 
here a sergeant said as he went by it was a rough flight 
col dave hale a burly man with a camouflaged face read a

a state appeals court friday called 
floridas abortionconsent law constitutionally infirm 
agreeing with a lower court judge who had declared the law could 
not be enforced 
in a 21 ruling the 5th district court of appeal here upheld a 
decision by lake circuit judge jerry lockett who ruled may 4 that 
the law requiring parental or judicial consent for a minor to seek 
an abortion was too vague 
the appeals court also said the state law failed to protect the 
privacy of minors guaranteed under roe v wade the 1973 us 
supreme court decision which made abortion legal 
the appeals court remanded the case back to lockett with the 
order than he dismiss the petition filed by a 15yearold pregnant 
teenager who had sought his permission for an abortion 
the decision to terminate the pregnancy is up to the girl 
and her physician without state regulation the court ruled 
the court said the vagueness of the law opened up a clear 
danger that trial judges would render a decision on the basis of 
their own moral religious or political beliefs regarding 
abortion 
the appellate courts rulings are binding statewide unless as 
often happens in controversial cases another state appeals court 
takes a similar case and reaches a different decision said volusia 
circuit judge c mcferrin smith 
then for the decision to apply statewide it would have to be 
appealed to the florida supreme court 
the law approved by the legislature last year requires single 
girls under 18 to get permission from a parent guardian or judge 
before obtaining an abortion 
the law says judges can approve an abortion if they decide the 
girl is sufficiently mature to make the decision if consent is 
unreasonably withheld by a parent or guardian or if the girl fears 
emotional or physical abuse if she tells her parents 
lockett declared the law unconstitutional after being asked to 
give permission for an abortion to a 15yearold girl who was 11 
weeks pregnant 
lockett said the law was too vague and couldnt be properly 
handled in the courts lockett in his ruling said he couldnt hold 
a proper hearing on the issue because hes unsure what the law 
means by sufficiently mature 
the florida law took effect oct 1 five days later a federal 
court barred its enforcement because no implementation rules were 
included the ban was lifted when the florida supreme court issued 
the rules in february 
the lake case was appealed by attorney jerry blair of leesburg 
who is representing the girl all of the proceedings are secret and 
court files are sealed to protect her identity

the senate voted friday to delay for 60 days 
the implementation of ethics regulations that several federal 
officials have blamed for their decisions to retire early 
the delay passed by unanimous consent is expected to go to the 
house for a vote monday said a spokeswoman for sen john glenn 
dohio who sponsored the measure at the bush administrations 
request 
the regulations which would take effect tuesday without the 
delay were cited as a reason for this weeks retirement of the 
national aeronautics and space administrations acting chief of the 
space station thomas l moser 
other nasa officials and officials in other federal agencies 
have announced their retirements in recent weeks in an effort to 
avoid being covered by the regulations 
the regulations would prohibit federal contractors from hiring 
government officials who have supervised their competitors 
projects the contractors would be subject to fines of up to 1 
million and imprisonment of up to five years 
the administration sought the 60day delay so employees could be 
trained in the details of the rules glenns spokeswoman said the 
law was passed in october and draft rules were released in march 
the rules were intended to eliminate the types of problems that 
have come to light in the pentagon procurement scandal

a judge threatened to jail movie producer 
robert evans for contempt of court friday after he refused to 
testify about a 6yearold murder case involving his movie the 
cotton club 
evans invoked his fifth amendment privilege against self 
incrimination 
mr evans this court can hold you in contempt and this court 
can order you incarcerated if you do not answer the questions do 
you understand that sir asked municipal court judge patti jo 
mckay 
yes evans replied almost in a whisper 
his lawyer robert l shapiro said the producer of such hits as 
the godfather chinatown and love story refused to 
testify because the prosecution refuses to clear him as a suspect 
in the murder of roy radin 
radin a new york theatrical producer was found shot to death 
in 1983 cocaine the lure of easy money and hollywood avarice 
surrounded his murder authorities said 
radin had offered to help evans raise funds for the cotton 
club before he disappeared 
prosecutors allege karen delayne laynie greenberger a 
41yearold reputed drug dealer ordered radins killing in a 
dispute over a multimilliondollar deal to finance the 1984 film 
the cotton club 
mr evans has told me that he is absolutely innocent of any 
involvement shapiro told the judge but he added he could not 
advise evans to testify while a cloud of suspicion hangs over him 
deputy district attorney david conn said he would not grant 
evans immunity from prosecution in return for his testimony 
mr evans is a witness and he is nothing more than a witness 
at this time said conn he suggested that if evans is innocent 
nothing he says could incriminate him 
the judge granted a request by shapiro for time to file legal 
citations with the court she ordered evans to return to court 
monday morning 
evans had waited in the courthouse most of the day while 
procedural motions were argued he was called as the first witness 
in a case involving hollywoods inner circle the porno empire of 
hustler magazine publisher larry flynt and a major cocaine 
network 
the judge denied a motion to dismiss the case on grounds that 
the time limit for beginning a speedy preliminary hearing had 
elapsed she also refused to allow cameras in the courtroom during 
the hearing 
key witnesses in the case include actor demond wilson the 
onetime star of sanford and son who was a friend of radin and 
flynts former brotherinlaw william ryder who headed an army of 
private security guards who protected flynt 
mrs greenbergers three codefendants alex lamota marti 
william molony mentzer and robert ulmer lowe former flynt 
bodyguards are alleged to have killed radin for financial gain 
lowe remains in maryland where he is fighting extradition 
the radin case had remained a mystery since 1983 but late last 
year ryder came forward saying he had new information to offer 
prosecutors reportedly wired him with tape recording devices 
and sent him to gather evidence 
cocaine money and the movie business were said to have led to 
radins death 
mrs greenberger who was said to have close ties to the latin 
american drug network of carlos lehder was identified early on as 
the woman who introduced radin to evans as someone who could raise 
money for the cotton club 
when radin 33 made a deal with the puerto rican government for 
financing mrs greenberger demanded a large share of the movie 
profits the prosecutor has said she also accused radin of 
stealing 1 million in cocaine and cash from her garage 
the pudgy cocainesniffing radin had been last seen getting 
into a limousine with mrs greenberger en route to dinner at la 
scala restaurant in beverly hills 
a month later radins body was found in a dry riverbed near 
gorman about 65 miles north of los angeles he had been shot in the 
head 
evans the former head of production at paramount pictures was 
questioned by authorities but never charged in the case conn has 
refused to rule him out as a suspect and said he hoped evans 
testimony in court will clarify his role 
in recent years mrs greenberger 41 lived in okeechobee 
fla where last september her husband larry was found shot to 
death at their home larry greenberger was reputed to be a key 
figure in the colombian drug empire of lehder who is now serving a 
life sentence plus 135 years in federal prison in marion ill

nicaragua and the soviet union on friday denounced president 
bushs decision to send more us troops to panama with nicaraguan 
president daniel ortega calling the action illegal 
vadim perfiliev a soviet foreign ministry spokesman told 
reporters in moscow the panamanian situation was marred by us 
interference 
it is a matter for the panamanian people themselves to clear 
up the situation and break the deadlock he said any outside 
interference is only exacerbating the already very serious 
situation 
perfiliev said it was vital to avoid creating another hotbed 
of international tension 
the soviet government newspaper izvestia said friday the 
panamanian government controlled by gen manuel antonio noriega 
should try to reach a compromise with the opposition but it did not 
make any suggestions 
ortega speaking at a news conference in dublin ireland at the 
end of a 10nation tour of europe said what the bush 
administration has done is absolutely illegal under the un 
charter 
it is absolutely inadmissible for the united states to resort 
to the use or threat of use of force he added we can 
guarantee that no latin american is going to defend the us use of 
force or threat of the use of force in panama 
ortega claimed the united states spent millions of dollars to 
destablize panamas election the united states had said even 
before the elections took place that it would not respect the 
results he said this has led us to a crisis which as latin 
americans must concern us 
if foreign support is required for panama let it come from 
within latin american countries but always within the framework of 
international law ortega said 
barricada the newspaper of nicaraguas ruling sandinistas said 
friday bushs decision to reinforce the us troops in panama means 
the united states hopes to renege on the agreement to relinquish 
the panama canal at the end of the century 
the managua newspaper said the bush administration is seeking 
to recover perpetual rights over the canal and assure its control 
over the hemisphere 
it quoted officials as saying the sandinista army remained in a 
state of combat alert to repel any possible us military 
intervention in central america reporters in managua said no 
unusual military activity was apparent 
in japan the foreign ministry said the government has been 
deeply concerned with reports indicating various injustices in the 
panamanian presidential and other elections on may 7 
a statement said the government strongly deplores the 
attacks against opposition candidates and such conduct is 
inexcusable in international society 
commenting on the panamanian electoral tribunals action 
wednesday nullifying the election the ministry said that although 
it was a domestic issue the decision is totally regrettable 
the panamanian people have the right to decide on the future 
of the country it said japan strongly calls upon the 
government of panama to respect the general will of its people and 
hopes that political stability in panama will be established as 
soon as possible

four members of the ecclesia athletic 
association were convicted of firstdegree manslaughter friday in 
the beating death of an 8yearold girl 
prosecutors said dayna broussard daughter of the groups 
founder was struck hundreds of times oct 13 as punishment for 
stealing food from another childs plate 
the clackamas county circuit court jury after deliberating 
about 11 hours over two days returned the guilty verdicts against 
willie k chambers 35 of san diego brian k brinson 31 
constance z jackson 38 and frederick p doolittle 28 all of 
los angeles 
the defendants were stoic as the jury was polled defense 
attorneys said they would appeal the verdict 
circuit judge john lowe said he would order a presentence report 
before setting a sentencing date each of the four faces a maximum 
penalty of 20 years in prison 
witnesses testified that chambers did most of the beating while 
doolittle and brinson held the girl down jackson was accused of 
striking and biting the child 
eldridge broussard jr founded the group in the watts area of 
los angeles to steer children away from drugs and crime and to 
motivate them through tough discipline and athletic training 
broussard 35 was in los angeles at the time of his daughters 
death at a farmhouse about 30 miles southeast of portland 
his daughter was beaten with an electrical cord rubber hose 
piece of plastic pipe bamboo pole and weightlifting belt 
witnesses testified 
most of the 53 other children who were staying at the sandyarea 
house were forced to watch the beating prosecutors said several 
testified that dayna was slammed against a wall kicked tripped 
slapped dropped on the floor shoved bitten spit upon and hung 
out a window 
after daynas body was delivered to a fire station the other 
children ranging in age from 1 months to 16 years were taken 
into state custody the children now are living in foster homes or 
with relatives 
the children were brought to oregon last summer while the los 
angeles center was being renovated 
broussard did not attend the trial but his wife whose name 
also is dayna attended parts of it 
broussard has blamed negative news coverage for his daughters 
death he denied that the children were beaten or abused saying 
they were only spanked 
deputy district attorney alfred j french iii contended all four 
defendants acted in concert to beat the child 
defense attorneys countered that the defendants did not know the 
child was in danger of dying during the discipline session and they 
questioned whether the girl died of the beating or of treatment she 
received in efforts to revive her 
they called to the witness stand dr william brady former state 
medical examiner who said the act of hanging the child out a 
window was the precipitating cause of death 
the current medical examiner dr larry lewman testified for 
the prosecution that the girl died of blows to the head

a mother was charged friday with 
concealing a homicide and obstructing justice in the 1986 death of 
her firstborn daughter as authorities try to unravel the mystery 
of her second babys slaying two weeks ago 
paula sims 29 and her husband robert reported each of the 
baby girls abducted by a masked gunman who threatened mrs sims and 
took the infants while sims was at work 
authorities have considered them suspects in both deaths no 
charges have been filed in the latest case 
jersey county states attorney richard j ringhausen signed a 
criminal complaint friday alleging one count of concealing a 
homicide and three counts of obstructing justice in the death three 
years ago of 13dayold loralei sims said linda long chief deputy 
court clerk 
mrs sims turned herself to county authorities a few hours after 
charges were filed she was arrested and then released on 10 
percent of a 100000 bond covered with a cashiers check signed 
by her father 
she was accompanied by her attorney donald groshong who 
entered a plea of innocent on all charges groshong demanded access 
to all information gathered by the state 
neither mrs sims nor her attorney had any comment although 
groshong has said previously the couple is innocent of any 
wrongdoing 
sims was not named in the complaint which says mrs sims knew 
loralei had died by homicidal means and gave false information 
to county sheriff frank yocom and state police investigators 
at a news conference ringhausen said the charges were prompted 
by concerns that the threeyear statute of limitations on the 
charges was about to run out the statute does not apply to murder 
cases 
certainly it has been on my mind a long time said county 
sheriff frank yocom the chief investigator indeed ive said for 
a long time i want to see this cleared 
the charges are the first in the case which began june 17 
1986 when the simses told police that a masked gunman broke into 
their home and abducted loralei 
the decomposed remains of a baby believed to be loralei were 
found several days later following an intensive search near the 
couples home in brighton a rural jersey county community 
the simses refused to answer questions before the grand jury 
that considered the case in early 1987 citing their fifth 
amendment protection against selfincrimination the panel took no 
action 
mrs sims appeared thursday before a grand jury in madison 
county where the couple have since moved that jury is hearing 
evidence in the death of the simses 6weekold second baby girl 
heather lee mrs sims parents and her husbands sister and 
brotherinlaw also were subpoenaed 
sims 37 was not asked to appear police have said he told them 
he believes his wife may have killed their daughters accidentally 
on april 29 the couple reported that heather lee was abducted 
from the familys new home in alton about 10 miles from brighton 
her body was found in a trash barrel may 3 across the 
mississippi river in west alton mo an autopsy showed she was 
smothered by someone putting a hand over her mouth tests also 
indicated that the body had been frozen 
the family buried heather on wednesday next to the unmarked 
grave containing the remains believed to be loraleis 
the couple also have a son 15monthold randy who was removed 
to state custody last week witnesses have said mrs sims wanted a 
son and was unhappy at the births of her daughters

people with aids who are living in 
citysponsored apartments may have their rent raised from 25 
percent of their stipends to 30 percent the city said friday 
the proposed increase would initially affect only about 20 
people who have aids and live in citysponsored apartments said 
lee jones a mayoral spokesman more people would be affected as 
additional apartments are readied 
the proposal was disclosed after city council president andrew 
stein criticized an earlier proposal to raise the amount to 40 
percent 
people with aids are barely able to survive under the current 
formula stein said in letters to city human resources 
administrator william grinker and budget director paul dickstein 
it is unjust for your office to now institute a policy 
compelling these individuals to hand over almost half of their 
monthly check he wrote 
grinker and dickstein replied that given the current 
supplemental security income each person with aids gets per month 
the increase to 30 percent will leave them with 312 to spend for 
other needs 
they said it costs the city about 1500 a month to support each 
apartment because of socialsupport services provided 
the proposed increase will be included in the mayors fiscal 
1990 budget proposal due next week

election process he had gone into the elections seeking legitimacy 
for the regime

war who have unsuccessfully sought to have the government admit 
their exposure to the toxic herbicide has caused health problems

every day 12yearold shashi bushan das 
starts out at dawn with a burlap sack over his bony shoulder at 
the end of the day the sack is bulging with trash and if hes 
lucky he has earned the equivalent of 1 
shashi is a ragpicker one of the tens of thousands of children 
in new delhi who scrounge through garbage bins gutters and waste 
dumps 
trash dealers buy what they find paper plastic shopping bags 
parts of automobiles and pieces of brass and tin 
the children start out at 5 am and work in pairs until noon 
when they stop for their first meal of the day 
a survey published by praveen nangia a social scientist and 
expert on child labor says 80 percent of these children live alone 
and sleep on sidewalks in the summer and in governmentrun shelters 
during the winter 
by the time these children who are aged between 5 and 15 
reach the junk dealer their sacks weigh nearly 10 to 15 kilograms 
22 to 33 pounds the survey said 
dreary as it may seem ragpicking is one of the more lucrative 
forms of child labor in india today an expert picker may earn up 
to 1 a day the daily per capita income of india is 66 cents 
there is lot of money in garbage said gerry j pinto of the 
united nations childrens fund unicef who works on the 
organizations program for destitute children in india 
ragpicking pays more than any other form of child labor in india 
where every third child works said vidyaben shah president of the 
indian council for child welfare a voluntary organization with 
offices in each of indias 25 states 
no official estimates are available on the number of ragpickers 
in india pinto puts the figure at 50000 but adds he could be wide 
off the mark 
pinto said that although a law regulates working conditions for 
child laborers in most industries none covers ragpickers who 
are doing a very legitimate service to the city 
most of these children are runaways forced to flee homes in 
villages because of poverty or family breakups and now fighting for 
survival in the towns he said 
ragpicking is the easiest thing to do when a child lands up in 
the city you dont need any skills you dont need licenses and 
you can go into business directly after gettng down from the bus or 
train 
shashi operates in areas around the railroad station which was 
the first landmark he saw on arriving eight months ago 
shashi said he ran away from his remote village in the eastern 
state of bihar after he got into altercation with his schoolmaster 
he deliberately failed me in exams even though i had studied 
well and then my father beat me up so i ran away said shashi 
these children poke their hands in garbage dumps where dirty 
pigs and dogs nuzzle for food they live in garbage sleep in 
garbage and wake up in garbage said ms shah who has worked 
with street children for the past 30 years 
nangias survey taken from interviews with children from six 
areas of the city indicated that none of them wants to be in the 
business forever 
shashi already is planning something else 
in six months i will save money to buy a cart he said 
then i will sell peanuts and cucumbers

stacy keach didnt mind the 125foot parachute 
plunge into downtowns glitter gulch the motorcycle chase across 
the desert or squaring off against exfootball terror lyle alzado 
but dont ask him to repeat that 50yard swim in 50degree lake 
mead at least not with his shoes on 
keach spent a week here in early march filming a twohour movie 
murder takes all mike hammer in las vegas the movie will air 
sunday on cbs 
hammer in las vegas tested the mettle of keach 47 who has 
a penchant for doing many of his own stunts 
and it provided a new challenge for jay bernstein the hollywood 
producer who stood by keach when the actor served nine months in an 
english prison on drug charges in 1985 at the zenith of the weekly 
detective shows popularity 
bernstein was determined to keep hammer alive and keach a viable 
commodity in the pr conscious film industry his tenacity played a 
major role in salvaging both 
i put two mortgages on my house and went on the road selling 
the hammer series to the public bernstein said in a telephone 
interview from his los angeles office i believe in america you 
only pay once for a debt once for a mortgage once for a mistake 
we let people have a second chance 
bernstein says his efforts resulted in an outpouring of 400000 
letters backing keach the result a 1986 tv movie the return of 
mike hammer and a new hammer series in the 198687 season 
with the series behind them bernstein and keach are looking at 
three twohour hammer movies the first set in las vegas providing 
all the action sex glamour and excitement befitting mickey 
spillanes famous detective hero 
keach said he doesnt miss the weekly series you can tell a 
better story in two hours he said generally you get a better 
show 
the first day of filming keach wafted into the heart of the 
downtown casino district on a parachute 
mike hammer gets thrown out of a plane and lands in the middle 
of las vegas keach explained of course why not 
in reality keach was hoisted 125 feet into the air by a crane 
then floated down as thousands of spectators watched 
the next two days were spent at lake mead filming on and around 
a 56foot yacht the hilton hotels lady hilton 
one scene called for hammer to jump from the yacht just before 
it exploded then swim 50 yards to a waiting boat keach performed 
the stunt himself wearing a wetsuit to help ward off the chill 
but he learned in the first take that it was a serious mistake to 
wear shoes 
im telling you you almost lost me keach told publicist 
welton smith after struggling out of the water subsequent takes 
were shot with keach swimming shoeless 
this is as much of a workout as ive had for any mike hammer 
show keach said after a scene in which he confronted alzado 
in another scene keach and a villain wrestle in a surveillance 
area above the hiltons giant casino then crash through the 
ceiling onto a craps table below its one of the few scenes where 
keach opts for a double 
keach said when he first read the script he figured there would 
be no chance of doing the scene because i knew youd never find 
a place in las vegas that would let you shoot something like that 
casino owners are skittish about filming in gaming areas but 
the idea was welcomed by hilton publicity director bruce banke who 
is interested in promoting use of the hotel as a shooting location 
for tv and motion picture films 
bernstein thinks las vegas is a perfect locale for mike hammer 
anything you can do to get mike hammer as a fish out of water 
is good bernstein said in las vegas youre putting him in 
another fishoutofwater situation this time with neon 
hammer will really be a fishoutofwater in two upcoming films 
with locations planned for singapore and behind the iron curtain

its been two years since garrison 
keillor came to denmark to lead the life of a tall silent 
person leaving behind buster the showdog sheila the christian 
jungle girl and other inhabitants of lake wobegon 
during that time he returned to the united states and managed 
to put another book on the market now hes looking ahead to fresh 
ventures while trying to find a new spot on which to hang his hat 
keillor still calls minnesota home even though he has a place 
in manhattan and makes frequent trips to his wife ulla skaerveds 
native denmark where they also have an apartment 
his new book we are still married is a potpourri of 
letters poems and stories written during the reagan years his 
first book was about his fictional hometown lake wobegon days 
his next was leaving home 
more than 4 million people tuned into american public radios 
a prairie home companion keillors hit radio show that 
celebrated the norwegian bachelor farmers and others of the quiet 
imaginary little town of lake wobegon the town that time forgot 
the show started in 1974 and keillor gave the last broadcast in 
june 1987 
to the end a prairie home companion was keillors show 
reflecting his diverse and sometimes cornball musical tastes and 
his affection for smalltown life but since leaving the show 
keillor has been unsettled and at loose ends 
the worst possible thing is when all your dreams come true 
and mine did including some i didnt realize i had but i felt 
better about facing up to those things in minnesota he said in 
an interview 
the show was broadcast from st paul but the 46yearold 
keillor staged it in lake wobegon minn which became so familiar 
that some listeners thought it was a real town 
the monologues grew from a regional hit show into a national 
phenomenon running more than a decade keillors bestselling 
lake wobegon days was the book version of his radio humor 
the radio show made keillor a nationally known figure wider 
recognition came after the success of the book and it generated a 
resentment that he said took him by surprise 
if somebody id gone to school with whom i didnt think was 
that smart to begin with had written a book that sold a whole lot 
of copies i would envy him i know that i would he said 
keillor said he felt forced to give up his home when the local 
press took too much interest in his private life it bewildered 
me i had no idea what they were aiming at said keillor he felt 
hatred directed against him which was entirely strange to him 
what bothered him most was that he couldnt see anything funny 
about it usually i can think of something humorous about 
something but ive never been able to write about that it just 
seems so utterly grim 
today keillor thinks less about that time which he calls 
awkward confusing and embarrassing 
he confessed to escaping the midwest first to europe then to 
new york i fled first to copenhagen sort of under the illusion 
that i could live over here he said 
keillors move to denmark was accompanied by much fanfare 
particularly since his humor played on themes of smalltown america 
and values inherited from the scandinavian immigrants who settled 
his lake wobegon but he had problems working here and found he 
could write more easily in the united states 
i was embarrassed and had to go back to america i suppose 
that was kind of embarrassing too to have failed so publicly to 
have planted your flag so publicly and having to pull it out he 
said 
denmark provided some anonymity but the humorist feels like a 
tourist here and he cannot foresee adjusting to the danish scene 
while in copenhagen he mixes socially with danes and with other 
americans shoots baskets near his home and does occasional 
speaking engagements 
after only a short spell on his first visit to the country he 
was so taken with denmark that he thought it could be material for 
a book but that feeling of newness has worn off and he now feels 
hed have trouble writing a few good paragraphs 
nonetheless he has spent a good deal of time over the past 
three years in denmark and plans to continue doing so 
i think it is such an amazing thing to come to another country 
and marry someone from another country its miraculous he said 
and then to do it in middle age to have a passionate romance 
when youre 43 i cant wish things were different 
keillor is concentrating on his writing but would like to get 
back onto the airwaves i want to start up another radio show and 
make something of the second half of my life

19801984 and found that the less information families had about 
their children the likelier were such problems as runaways 
disobedience or physical attacks 
ten percent to 15 percent of adoptions are stopped before 
theyre finalized and a smaller minority are dissolved 
estimated jeff rosenberg director of public policy for the 
national commitee for adoption a washingtonbased nonprofit 
group of adoption agencies parents children and experts 
the stantons who have been married 11 years explored adoption 
after exhausting all means to conceive their disappointment turned 
to anticipation when they learned in 1985 that the private adoption 
agency hope cottage was seeking 50 adoptive couples 
in october 1986 3weekold stacey came to their suburban dallas 
home 
the moment she was placed in our arms she was our baby 
said stanton 39 an insurance agent but staceys mental 
development stopped at four to six months said mrs stanton she 
never learned to wave byebye play pattycake little stacey never 
tuned in 
by the time tests revealed stacey would never develop the 
stantons had adopted her stacey went back to hope cottage last 
june but mrs stanton says emphatically we didnt return her 
we gave her up 
last july they asked dallas family court judge hal gaither to 
legally declare the child not theirs in february they told 
gaither they were not equipped to raise a severely retarded child 
i have a deep compassion for special children but i dont 
have the emotional makeup to teach them said mrs stanton 41 a 
former elementary schoolteacher 
where do you draw the line gaither said recently do you 
allow the adoption agency to come back and pick up kids because 
they cry at night or if it has blue eyes and you wanted green eyes 
no you cant turn a child back in 
gaither terminated the stantons visitation rights and relieved 
them of financial responsibility but refused to erase their 
parental rights in case the adoption agency later had its own 
financial or business problems what if an adoption agency 
agrees to take a child back into custody and they go bankrupt 
or a new regime comes in and wont honor the contract now where is 
the kid he said 
the stantons say they endured painful criticism from friends and 
judgment by strangers because of their highly publicized case 
people said they could never give up their child but they 
were thinking of their little normal children mrs stanton said 
i know even as i try to explain they cant realize the pain we 
literally cried from the time we woke up to the time we went to 
bed 
chandler minister of highlands christian church in dallas says 
he can understand the first day his new daughter walked into their 
home she picked up markers and drew all over the carpet later 
she began lying and stealing one day she threatened to kill the 
chandlers two biological sons 
kids threaten chandler said but there was a look in her 
eye a rage in her face that was horrifying 
chandler who decided to adopt because it was a christian thing 
to do admits that as he tried to cope with his daughters violent 
behavior he thought about taking her back to the texas department 
of human services 
after many visits with counselors the chandlers finally found a 
colorado psychiatrist who said the girls behavior was the result 
of sexual abuse she has been undergoing treatment at the colorado 
clinic since january the chandlers dont know when shell be able 
to come home 
the human services department revealed in a threepage summary 
of the girls case that she had been abused but not the extent of 
her mistreatment chandler said the information we received was 
very very general 
with their lawsuit the chandlers and five other families hope 
to force the state to give prospective parents more background 
about adoptable children 
a federal judge has ruled against the parents saying they have 
no constitutional right to the information they seek their appeal 
is pending before the 5th us circuit court of appeals in new 
orleans 
health services officials have declined to talk specifically 
about the chandler case while it is pending but spokeswoman diane 
scott said the agency has always told parents what type of home a 
child came from and how the child came into custody of the agency 
as required by the texas family code 
the department must provide information on the childs health 
social educational and genetic history but can summarize that 
background 
caseworkers also discuss any medical or psychological treatment 
the child has undergone ms scott said we also encourage the 
families to talk with the childs physician or therapist to 
understand the implications of the childs condition and need for 
treatment 
the texas senate has passed a bill that would give parents the 
right to see copies of all the childrens records edited to 
protect birth parents adopted children would be able to see the 
documents at adulthood 
the chandlers arent sure if they would have adopted their 
daughter had they known her history but they believe the 
information could have helped them address her problems sooner 
the stantons say they would like to have some part in staceys 
life again when they are stronger but they are unlikely to adopt 
again 
we can love again mrs stanton said but that joy and 
excitement she brought into our life you dont replace it

with more than 115 million records sold worldwide 
and his 76th album due in the stores over the next several days 
selling records is still tough for superstar julio iglesias 
its the worst thing in life to sell records the 
45yearold performer said in a recent interview on stage you 
can be better but once the record is in the shops theres no 
way to get it back 
raices spanish for roots is his latest album out this 
month he and model brooke shields recently finished filming a 
45minute music video in miami based on one of the albums songs 
the album will be released in spanish french italian and 
portuguese but it will be an american sound iglesias said 
its very lively in a way but in another way its completely 
different in the way we use instruments he said i love very 
much this album i hope 
even after iglesias has sold 115 million records a number 
comparable to michael jackson and bruce springsteen he wonders 
whether he can keep up the pace in record sales but he has doubts 
about his success both in america and overseas 
success in life is illogical there is not a logical answer 
if you have an explanation why you have success you just have to 
put in a computer this and this and this and you are going to have 
success in america and its not true iglesias said so dont 
ask me why i have success in america because if i knew why i would 
doubt it 
after a promising career as a professional soccer goalie in 
spain iglesias was in a car accident that paralyzed him from the 
waist down he underwent four years of intensive rehabilitation 
including exercising his injured fingers with a guitar his family 
gave him 
he vowed to his mother that he would sing at a spanish song 
festival and iglesias kept his vow in 1968 his singing career was 
launched 
another challenge was learning english at 38 years old 
in all the latino roots of languages like italian and 
spanish i found my music much more natural iglesias said 
whats happened in english for example is that the phrasing is 
completely different 
iglesias has recorded only 30 songs in english but some have 
been hits such as duets with such artists as stevie wonder willie 
nelson and diana ross the native of madrid has recorded 150 songs 
in spanish 74 in french 60 in italian 45 in portuguese and 30 in 
german 
his black hair slicked straight back and wearing all white 
iglesias said a third allenglish album may be recorded sometime 
this summer 
it takes two years for me to do an english album correctly 
he said it takes too much stress out of my life to do an english 
album and i love to sing in english 
iglesias who is divorced and a father of two sons and a 
daughter lives in indian creek village on a private island near 
miami beach he is part owner of the miami heat the rookie pro 
basketball team 
he did one worldwide tour last year and is planning another 
as for his success with the tour that will be determined by 
the outbreak of goose bumps 
i always said in a concert of two hours if you are able for 
five minutes to put people in goose bumps some people will never 
forget you 
some havent 
iglesias has it all now his personal life is balanced and he 
has all the money he needs his only doubts are surviving as an 
artist whose ballads can move an audience 
theres a moment in your life when you dont need the money 
its not a question of making you richer than you already are 
thats over in my life iglesias said i dont need anything 
else than success than lights than surviving as an artist

singapore is wooing foreign moviemakers and 
capital as the great commercial center tries to become 
hollywoodonthesouth china sea 
international films are regularly shot on location here but 
there are no local studios now separate groups of investors from 
italy and hong kong have announced plans to build studios in the 
western part of this citystate 
italys cecchi gori group agreed to spend 625 million to 
develop two sound stages outdoor sets offices and other 
facilities on 25acre seaside site construction is expected to 
start late this year or early 1990 according to vittorio cecchi 
gori chairman of the group which also cofinanced the academy 
awardwinning the last emperor 
when his subsidiary is completed cecchi gori summit studios in 
singapore expects to produce as many as 10 englishlanguage feature 
films a year he said 
work has already started on the second project called tang 
dynasty village the 30acre area combines a film studio with a 
theme park featuring the chinese architectural style of the tang 
era 1300 years ago 
organized by hong kong entrepreneur deacon chiu developers of 
the 26 million movie town and cultural display plan to turn out an 
average of three films a year 
to lure producers the governments economic development board 
offers tax holidays and other incentives edb chairman philip yeo 
expects a comprehensive film industry to evolve around the infant 
studios which will need processing laboratories postproduction 
houses and a pool of actors and technicians 
some observers say singapores move is shrewd because chinas 
takeover of hong kong in 1997 is likely to spark an exodus of some 
members of the british colonys booming film industry another 
factor is the possibility that movies made in taiwan might be 
barred from hong kong after 1997 
at first glance this island republic of 26 million people 
would seem an unlikely spot to produce films particularly those 
aimed in part at local viewers 
censorship is heavyhanded and the makers of some awardwinning 
movies have refused to release them rather than submit to cuts 
platoon oliver stones haunting portrait of the vietnam war 
which won four oscars and three golden globes was withdrawn in 
1987 
a representative from the board of film censors demanded 28 
cuts said arnold kopelson a producer the irony of this issue 
is that anyone can purchase the uncut version in the form of a 
pirated cassette 
illegal pirate video tapes of most productions are not as 
widespread as a few years ago but in the early 1980s onceavid 
fans turned away from the silver screen in droves to watch movies 
at home 
the un educational scientific and cultural organization 
unesco statistical yearbook once listed singaporeans as the 
worlds leading filmgoers averaging on a per capita basis about 19 
visits to the movies each year the soviets were second with an 
average 18 visits a year 
attendance dropped from a peak of 461 million in 1979 when 
videocassette fever hit to 195 million in 1986 half of the 80 
cinemas doing a brisk business 10 years ago have closed 
mandarin malay english and tamil are the official languages 
chinese feature films now come mostly from hong kong and taiwan 
tamil and hindi films come from india and malay films from 
indonesia and malaysia englishlanguage films originate in the 
united states britain and italy 
viewers are not confined to specific ethnic groups since most of 
the offerings are subtitled in one or two other languages

imagine a film director forced 
to kill off a character he couldnt afford to take along to the 
next shoot that happened to idrissa ouedraogo while he was filming 
his awardwinning yam daabo the choice 
imagine a filmmaker who has to wait two to three weeks to see 
rushes while they are sent to europe for processing 
problems such as these confront african producers as they seek 
to compete with hollywood and the rest of the world in the movie 
industry 
that ouedraogo and other african producers have won several 
awards and a small following in the united states and europe in 
recent years indicates there are diamonds in an emerging industry 
riddled with problems and contradictions 
ouedraogo won the 1987 pan african film festivals prize in 
cinematography for his yam daabo malian producer souleymane 
cisees yeelen won the the prix du jury at the 1987 cannes film 
festival the movie also received critical acclaim at the new york 
film festival that year senegalese producer ousmane sembene won 
the 1988 grand prize of the jury at the 1988 mostra venice festival 
for a lot of people in europe and the states people who 
dont travel the cinema is an evasion and africa is a new 
world ouedraogo said but there also is the discovery or 
should i say rediscovery of human values relationships and 
sentiments these human themes have yet to be abandoned in a large 
number of african films and are themes that are still fresh for 
us 
the pace of these films can be slow perhaps magnifying the 
universal themes that anchor them marital infidelity power and 
corruption yam daabo follows a family driven from the land by 
drought and its problems 
patrick ilboudo a burkinabe journalist has written a book 
chronicling how african producers have come this far it is a 
history of the pan african film festival held every other year in 
this dusty sahel town 
independence left aspiring african film producers with balky old 
equipment where any was available at all ilboudo said the 
filmmakers also inherited a film genre that regarded africans as 
savage illiterate natives who were always dancing to drumbeats 
when the africans first started making films seriously in the 
1960s they felt obliged to rehabilitate a bastardized image of the 
black man said ilboudo 
although the filmmakers have mellowed they remain among the 
elite in their countries and usually have a statement to make says 
french film editor andree davanture who has worked on some of the 
best 
every film that is made in africa is a sacrifice for the 
population so if a film is made it must be well done to 
generate other films said ouedraogo 
finance is the biggest obstacle films shown at this years 
african film festival cost an average of 1 million peanuts by 
western standards but for countries unable to pay off their debts 
making movies is a luxury 
african films are largely financed by the government of the 
filmmaker or depend heavily on joint ventures with cultural 
cooperation programs of france holland west germany belgium and 
switzerland 
filmmakers in this landlocked west african nation which is 
fighting the advance of the sahara and ranked as the worlds third 
poorest by the world bank have the enthusiastic support of their 
government and are considered among the most productive in black 
africa they annually turn out one or two films 
kwah ansah a filmmaker from ghana said his prizewinning 
heritage of africa would be his last he had to go into debt to 
make it and is using the prize money to pay bills 
african filmmakers also are limited by materials and a poorly 
trained crew ouedraogo says lack of training is the main problem 
but only by making many pictures can the crew learn the tricks 
of the trade 
in the area of technique lighting sound filming editing 
you simply have to make an enormous amount of films to multiply 
your experiences you cant go to school to learn these things we 
dont have many productions so it is hard to accumulate the 
experiences ouedraogo said 
technical problems slow down the productions after each can of 
film was shot while ouedraogo was filming his new release 
yaaba grandmother it had to be immediately transported five 
hours south to refrigerators in ouagadougu to avoid the heat and 
dust and then shipped to labs in europe for processing by the 
time the rushes had returned several weeks later much momentum 
and motivation were lost 
film editor davanture says the shortage of trained personnel 
also can create artistic obstacles if an entire country has only 
one qualified camera operator imagine the difficulties that can 
arise if the communication is poor between him and the director 
still another problem is the writing hollywood understands 
more than any other film complex that everything rests on the 
screenplay even many filmmakers do not yet understand this and 
africans are just beginning to realize it said ouedrago yam 
daabo was shot without a screenplay 
if all the other obstacles are surmounted the producers still 
must get the films distributed its impossible to compete against 
films from developed countries 
the african films dont even have a chance in africa said 
exiled south african filmmaker lionel ngakane the cinema owners 
are usually not african and they too are not interested in 
african films because they dont make any money

while west germans struggle with growing hostility 
toward foreign workers east germans have happily opened the door 
to them 
by official count 90000 vietnamese angolans cubans 
mozambicans north koreans and chinese are at work in east germany 
about 70000 are vietnamese 
with the longest standard work week in europe 44 hours and 
every pair of hands already employed the east germans concede that 
to improve their economic prowess they need a little help from 
friends 
the foreigners take the least desirable and lowestpaying jobs 
often working the night shift to turn out light bulbs in plauen or 
shipping containers in rostock 
some spend free hours tailoring jeans outfits and custommade 
clothing for blackmarket sales to which east berlin officials 
deliberately turn their backs 
we have to achieve higher production with an absolutely 
declining population and we have temporarily found a solution by 
using vietnamese manpower said ekkehard sachse a leading 
government economics adviser naturally we have had some 
assimilation problems but the end result has been very 
satisfying 
foreign workers have been brought in for more than a decade to 
balance the loss of workingage east germans to emigration and a 
steadily falling birthrate 
but officials have only recently begun to acknowledge the extent 
of the foreign presence and their contribution to the east german 
economy already the most prosperous in eastern europe 
the staterun television network broadcast a 40minute 
documentary in early april explaining the advantages of imported 
labor for east german society the program aired twice during prime 
viewing hours appeared aimed at fostering positive attitudes toward 
the foreigners and diluting resentment over the strains they put on 
short supplies of housing and certain consumer goods such as 
sewing machines and bicycles 
vietnam is very happy with this solution as it solves some of 
their economic problems said sachse head of the demographics 
department at east germanys college of economics the vietnamese 
working in east germany send money and consumer goods home we 
estimate they are improving the lifestyles of about a million 
people there 
sachse said the level of foreign workers will grow through the 
year 1995 but that authorities hope to avoid a longterm 
dependence on imported labor 
we dont want to have millions of foreign workers here 
sachse said noting that most of those working in east germany are 
single but a longterm dependence would mean providing permanent 
housing and social services for foreign families 
guest workers are officially limited to fiveyear stints and 
most live in dormitories or communal housing provided by the 
factories and enterprises where they are assigned to work 
many west germans fear about 4 million guest workers in their 
country more than half of them from turkey contribute to west 
germanys 8 percent unemployment rate but east germans view the 
foreigners as potential relief for their overburdened work force 
east germany along with its 44hour work week has full 
employment of workingage men and 92 percent of workingage women 
according to a government study published late last year 
sachse said in an interview that the pressure on women to work 
contributes to the steady decline in births and to the nations 
astounding divorce rate an estimated twothirds of all marriages 
in east germany are eventually dissolved 
an average of 23 children per couple is needed to maintain the 
current population of 167 million but the latest statistics 
indicate the average is 19 and falling sachse said 
he also confirmed western estimates that the population dropped 
by about 20000 last year because of legal emigration to the west 
which is expected to continue at its current level for at least a 
few more years 
western diplomats said 40000 east germans were granted 
permission to emigrate to the west in 1988 and that an estimated 
200000 others have applied to leave 
automation improvements in some industries have eased the burden 
on a shrinking work force under growing pressure to produce more to 
satisfy both domestic and export needs but a chronic labor 
shortage persists prompting east germany to turn to its allies for 
additional help 
while both east german and western officials describe the import 
of foreign workers as a mostly positive influence on east german 
society the effort has not been problemfree 
east german media reports have alluded to incidents of 
interracial strife including a february article in dresdens 
saechsische zeitung reporting prison terms for two east germans who 
pushed a worker from mozambique in africa from a moving train 
officials contend racial incidents are rare but concede that 
tensions run high over the foreign workers tendency to buy up 
desirable consumer goods to take back home with them 
east germany and czechoslovakia enjoy a considerably higher 
standard of living than their communist neighbors in europe and 
allies in africa and southeast asia 
both nations slapped higher export tariffs on consumer goods at 
the first of the year to stem the outward flow of the most 
soughtafter items like bicycles small appliances shoes and 
betterquality clothing

diplomats and other negotiators from all over the 
world constantly fill up genevas hotels and restaurants but 
ordinary tourists apparently find the place dull 
tourism in geneva has been falling since 1984 and olivier vodoz 
head of the geneva tourist office believes its time to liven 
things up 
geneva must provide nonstop cultural artistic and athletic 
events he said we have to organize large concerts both 
classical and rock which will attract young people 
he thinks the city of 160000 permanent residents suffers from 
its staid image 
seventy percent of the people who are considered tourists are 
either businessmen representatives to international organizations 
or delegates attending conferences he said the other 30 
percent are people simply passing through 
with 270 restaurants many of them catering to the 
expenseaccount crowd a tourist office pamphlet describes geneva 
as one of the worlds gastronomic capitals but most prices are 
out of reach for the backpack crowd geneva also has 39 discos and 
night clubs but many require membership 
vodoz noted that chronic traffic congestion dissuades motorist 
travelers from stopping in geneva which has one of the worlds 
highest automobile densities in order to alleviate that problem 
the city is increasing its number of parking places 
high hotel prices 225 a night for a single at a plush 
lakeside hotel also are listed as contributing to the decline in 
tourist business in continental europes second most expensive 
city trailing copenhagen denmark 
with the help of the hoteliers we have made efforts to try to 
reduce prices but we can still do more vodoz said 
some relief is expected from the recent weakening of the swiss 
franc against the dollar and other major currencies and tourist 
officials hope the forecasts of higher crude oil prices will mean a 
return of freespending arabs 
but while it attempts to attract more tourists geneva will 
definitely not change its cityscape vodoz said 
as a result the city may appear less exciting or dynamic than 
other cities we will never become a hong kong or a monaco

yo james brown you may be sitting in jail 
but your souls on the loose in all kinds of songs thanks to raps 
booming use of a musical borrowing technique called sampling 
mixing a hunger for instant recognition with a disregard for 
copyright law rappers are exploiting sophisticated electronics to 
lift drum beats guitar riffs and vocal phrases from old songs and 
plunk them into their new works 
through digital sampling for example rapper ll cool j 
dresses up a song with chuck berrys guitar licks 
both sampling and rap are so popular that lawyers are loading up 
their litigation bags to handle the potential barrage of copyright 
lawsuits at the heart of the debate is whether rap is a legally 
protected hiphopping art form or just hightech cattle rustling 
i dont see any protection for sampling anywhere ever 
said peter paterno a music industry attorney whose clients include 
guns n roses i think every one of these guys who samples is 
going to lose in court 
ricky grundy copresident and owner of graffiti talk music 
says there should be compensation for sampling the rappers are 
not being creative theyre using other talent to make up an 
idea he said 
indeed frank zappa now puts this warning on his rock albums 
unauthorized reproductionsampling is a violation of applicable 
laws and subject to criminal prosecution 
yet rappers and their supporters insist that this popculture 
pastiche represents raps essence without sampling they insist 
there wouldnt be any raps worth rapping 
thats a part of rap sampling said tone loc whose wild 
thing includes bits from van halens jamies crying and 
whose funky cold medina appropriates parts of foreigners hot 
blooded 
you bring back old songs that you might have forgot about or 
never heard before when you hear the little riff that little tune 
in your head it starts coming back to you and it sounds good 
said loc one of the few rappers who seeks permission for most of 
his musical raids we dont have live musicians to play for us i 
never had a live drummer 
todays digital technology reduces even the most complicated 
multilayered songs to individual data bits thus a single 
tambourine hit from a 40s classic that has been digitally 
rerecorded can be electronically extracted with surgical precision 
it can then be stored in a computer for use with other music 
without missing a beat 
discovering musical samples in current rap songs therefore can 
be a bit like easteregg hunts some cant be missed others 
require a painstaking search 
de la souls eye know borrows from steely dans peg and 
otis reddings sittin on the dock of the bay glovees 
suck on this contains a sequence from three dog nights mama 
told me not to come several years ago the english band 
frankie goes to hollywoods relax repeatedly reused a 
twosecond drum sequence from a 1969 led zeppelin album 
but the biggest source of this digital dredging is james brown 
now serving a sixyear sentence in south carolina for aggravated 
assault and failing to stop for police 
browns work has been replayed by the fat boys icet public 
enemy and a host of other rappers the music out there is only as 
good as my last record brown joked in a recent interview from 
jail with rolling stone magazine 
while an increasing number of rappers are following tone locs 
lead by obtaining rights and paying fees of several hundred dollars 
for each sample many do not the beastie boys for one are facing 
a copyright infringement suit over their song hold it now hit 
it the case could be the first to establish a legal precedent 
for future sampling disputes 
it is alleged that the beastie boys who sample the psycho 
film score on their upcoming album lifted the words yo leroy 
and some drum beats from jimmy castors 1977 single the return 
of leroy part one 
chuck ortner a lawyer representing beastie boys label def jam 
recordings said that even if the rappers did sample from castor 
which he disputes the band is protected in part by the fair use 
doctrine of the 1976 copyright act the same doctrine that allows a 
college professor to photocopy a short article for a class 
people who create rap music are basically using tapes and 
discs and records as musical instruments themselves ortner said 
and they should be as free to do that as if they were 
actually playing a conventional instrument if there is a blanket 
rule prohibiting this kind of activity then it will seriously 
impede the development of this kind of music 
yet when one of ortners own clients was sampled by the group 
blue mercedes not long ago he didnt hesitate to bring action 
against mca records resulting in a favorable settlement for 
ortners client the band marrs the difference between that 
case and the beastie boys he said is that blue mercedes sample 
was far too lengthy to let pass 
but the logical extension of ortners fair use defense said 
paul goldstein a professor of copyright law at stanford law 
school is that a filmmaker could make a movie out of a popular 
book such as gone with the wind without paying royalties 
so how will the dispute be resolved ortner and some lawyers 
suggest a sliding fee scale in which rappers would pay a few cents 
or less on the sale of each record featuring sampling 
the sampling and the use of somebodys prior material is 
something i have no objection to said jay morgenstern executive 
vice president and general manager of music publishing giant 
warnerchappell music but if youre going to use somebody elses 
material you should pay them a fair amount for it 
all i have requested of the people who do it is be honest and 
fair tell us before you do it well make an arrangement with you 
whereby a royalty will be paid and due credit will be given 
beyond its financial and legal impact sampling also might be 
impeding the skills of a new generation of musicians 
i have a nephew i tried to teach him guitar and he said 
later for that said rick skatore a bassist with the new york 
band 247 spyz he likes the beat box that little casio thing 
where you press a button and it plays the beat 
and i ran across another young kid his father has been a 
guitar player all his life and the kid said i dont like 
playing music having to learn it id rather sample it i like 
instant gratification and i said wow

employee who regularly checks prices in suburban washington 
listened politely while the manager rambled on about how fuels 
containing alcohol can mess up your car then headed for an 
auto dealership 
there she waited again the sales manager had temporarily 
vanished 
he goes on a brisk walk around the lot this time of day 
explained a fellow salesman 
the sales manager reappeared and gave her information on an auto 
he proudly described as a sport utility vehicle on steroids 
the price of the identical vehicle is checked at that dealership 
every other month 
nationwide 400 parttime agents track the costs of sets of 
items in seven major groups food housing apparel 
transportation medical care entertainment and the catchall 
other goods and services which ranges from haircuts to 
cigarettes 
prices on roughly 100000 items in 85 metropolitan areas are 
averaged and weighted according to their importance in calculating 
the index for urban consumers which covers 80 percent of the us 
population 
in march the most recent month for which figures were 
available prices rose 05 percent the index stood at 1223 
percent of its 198284 base meaning that a hypothetical selection 
of goods and services costing 100 in the base period would have 
cost 12230 in march 
the labor department does not allow public disclosure of the 
exact businesses individuals and items surveyed for the index 
which costs 28 million a year to compile 
ms mitchell who herself once worked part time gathering prices 
for the government said business people generally are cooperative 
even though their participation is unrewarded except for a 
thankyou letter at the end of five years when a new set of items 
and stores is selected 
they dont have to sell me anything and they dont have to buy 
or refuse to buy anything from me she said im probably one 
of the least pressuring people that walk in there 
from the car dealership she headed for a grocery store to 
survey prices on a dozen items radishes were on sale at five bags 
for 89 cents prompting ms mitchell to wonder what one would do 
with five packages of radishes 
next on the itinerary was a pizza parlor where she waited once 
again while a oneman crew juggled the hungry lunchtime crowd 
prices were down a plain medium pizza was selling for 699 
compared with 820 at the last visit the managers explanation 
for the price cuts competition 
ms mitchell said conducting price surveys has made her more 
savvy about getting good buys especially on cars but she added 
that after a while theres such an overload of information you 
dont remember anything 
data on housing costs is gathered from visits to thousands of 
renters and homeowners which is where ms mitchell said she became 
conversant with many dogs who more typically prey on mail 
carriers 
the housing survey sends the price surveyers into all sorts of 
neighborhoods including areas that have gotten less 
comfortable as violent crime rises she said 
ive met some mighty gutsy people living there and raising 
their kids ms mitchell said you may go from a really poor 
neighborhood to a really posh neighborhood to see them smack up 
against one another its just hard to look at 
recent cpi reports indicate inflation has racheted upward from 
the 44 percent levels registered in 1987 and 1988 for the first 
quarter of 1989 consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 61 
percent another sharp increase is expected when aprils report is 
released thursday 
the recent acceleration in the cpi has come despite a yearlong 
campaign by the federal reserve board to ease inflationary 
pressures by pushing up interest rates and restraining economic 
growth 
the persistent price increases occurring even as the economy 
shows signs of slowing have some analysts worried that the central 
bank may tighten credit so much to arrest inflation that the 
federal reserve unintentionally pushes the country into a recession 
others believe the fed will be able to engineer a soft 
landing in which growth slows enough to rein in the escalating 
cpi without snuffing out the nations 6yearold economic expansion 
while many people are aware of the inflation indexs influence 
on monetary policy few realize that fluctuations in the cpi can 
directly affect their own wages benefits and taxes said patrick 
jackman head of the labor departments cpi branch 
wage increases for 3 million workers covered by union contracts 
are tied to the index as are school lunch charges for 24 million 
youngsters and benefits levels for 38 million social security 
beneficiaries 3 million federal retirees and survivors and 19 
million food stamp recipients 
in addition the cpi is used to adjust the federal income tax 
structure to prevent bracket creep inflationinduced increases 
in tax rates 
virtually everybody who earns any income is potentially 
affected by the cpi jackman said 
because the monthly cpi report can send financial markets diving 
or soaring the figure is a closely guarded secret until its 
release at precisely 830 am on a weekday in the middle of the 
following month 
ms mitchell fresh from her latest canvass of prices said that 
when the figure finally reaches the headlines she knows the 
reality of where its coming from

a herd of llamas and alpacas en route 
to the united states from the cold high andes of chile have been 
stranded for seven weeks in the heat of a barren caribbean island 
seventyfive of the woolly beasts have perished mostly from the 
heat and stress 
the 178 survivors are awaiting delivery to american buyers as 
trendy pets pack animals or breeding stock in a 2million export 
deal 
but they have been held up by us regulations on footandmouth 
disease and have become the center of a feud involving 
animalwelfare activists the antiguan government and the us 
investors 
in all 268 llamas and alpacas were shipped but 15 died in a 
crating accident aboard a bolivian cargo plane on takeoff from 
chile 
after the remaining 253 arrived in the twin nation of antigua 
and barbuda about 250 miles east of puerto rico residents 
protesting their presence on barbuda blocked a quarantine station 
and forced the herd onto uninhabited billy island off antigua 
straight from the beginning it was a fiasco said john 
walsh regional director in boston of the londonbased world 
society for the protection of animals which monitors the 
commercial use of animals in my view it shows a lack of concern 
for the animals 
at one stage the beasts which belong to the camel family but 
have no hump were dying at a rate of two a day on billy island a 
hill of coral rock scrub brush and a few scrawny trees 
because llamas and alpacas live above the treeline in the andes 
they have no instinct to seek shade and succumbed in temperatures 
hitting the mid80s 
they really were just dropping like flies because of the 
heat said john schartner a scubadiving instructor hired to 
camp out on the island and care for the animals they didnt know 
enough to get in the shade most of them would just lie out and 
bake in the sun 
since then workers have built shelters with blue plastic 
tarpaulins to shade the herd and set up a supply line of hay and 
fresh water brought from antigua in 55gallon drums intravenous 
tubes and spray pumps were used to rehydrate the animals 
paula vachon of sarasota fla one of the four partners in the 
export deal who has been supervising the operation in antigua said 
only one animal had died this month a llama with a leg cut that 
got infected 
the llamas and alpacas were brought to antigua and barbuda 
about 250 miles east of puerto rico by two florida businessmen 
david strickland and keith kerr another partner is kerrs wife 
diane 
strickland a sarasota developer has been doing business in 
antigua and barbuda for 17 years kerr who owns a construction 
company in palmetto fla has a 12acre private zoo that includes 
lions tigers cougars bears wolves bobcats and an 8yearold 
elephant 
strickland said the partners bought the exotic creatures in 
chile for 50 to 120 each and hoped to sell them for 6500 to 
15000 each the deal would have netted a profit of around 2 
million he said 
the international llama association estimates there are 25000 
llamas and 1000 of the smaller alpacas in the united states 
in recent years the graceful mildnatured creatures with 
thick woolly coats have become increasingly popular and valuable 
males typically sell for 10000 and breeding females 30000 but 
prices vary greatly a prize stud reportedly sold for 115000 last 
year 
strickland said the idea was to export llamas and alpacas to pay 
for both a wildlife park in antigua and a 450000 quarantine 
station the investors built on barbuda 
the project went awry when a barge carrying the llamas and 
alpacas arrived off barbuda on march 23 an unruly crowd formed and 
refused to allow the vessel to unload 
underlying the protest was local hostility to a cement company 
strickland owns with deputy prime minister lester bird of antigua 
and two other cabinet ministers the company uses sand from barbuda 
in construction 
the main problem for the animals now is that the exporters 
shipped them from chile and brought them to antigua and neither 
country is regarded by the us government as free of 
footandmouth disease a contagious virus that can devastate 
livestock 
the animals have been inspected by a veterinarian from the us 
department of agriculture but they cannot enter the united states 
without undergoing a 90day quarantine the only approved facility 
the harry s truman animal import center in fleming key fla is 
booked through the end of september with a shipment of chinese pigs 
llama association president fred bauer accused the exporters of 
trying to circumvent usda regulations by setting up an unauthorized 
quarantine station nothing seems to ring quite true with this 
deal he said 
francie stull who raises russian wolfhounds near austin texas 
bought 160 of the animals from the florida investors for more than 
1 million and has already presold 49 of them for about 500000 
she said she was unaware until this past september that antigua 
had not done the necessary screening to be declared free of 
footandmouth disease but had been assured there would be no 
problem in obtaining the status 
asked what was likely to happen to the animals she said my 
best guess is that they will be put in some kind of facility where 
they are comfortable and be used as a breeder herd for the next 
couple of years while we negotiate the red tape 
mrs stull said she had fully insured her animals but 
strickland said the rest of the herd was not covered he said the 
partners stood to lose 13 million if the animals cannot be 
brought into the united states 
the government here has agreed to allow construction of another 
quarantine station this one on a peninsula of antigua along with 
the promised wildlife park as a tourist attraction 
we dont want these animals to suffer anymore said 
government spokesman barry stevens theyve been brought here 
and theres nowhere else for the them to go now weve got to 
salvage the situation

women like monique ralaimandy 
and vero rasendratsirofo are leading this indian ocean nation off 
africa out of its isolation and into the economic mainstream 
ralaimandy trained as an electronics engineer lost her job in 
1974 when president didier ratsiraka embarked on a socialist 
revolution and closed a us satellite tracking station 
there were no jobs after it closed so i started making 
dolls said ralaimandy 
she has since branched out from dolls and now has a workshop 
that employs 300 and produces nearly 1000 dresses a week for sale 
in france in april month she started a second shift 
when i started banks wouldnt help me she said now i 
have a banker as a financial adviser 
operating in a couple of sheds surrounded by frangipani and 
oleander vero rasendratsirofo is producing ceramic pots dishes 
vases piggy banks and ornamental items 
she employs 11 young men and two women at her establishment 
called atelier vero and has a hard time keeping up with demand 
last year she won the oscar the islands top award for 
handicrafts 
finance minister pascal rakotomavo said the success of these and 
other female entrepreneurs is a very encouraging sign 
us ambassador patricia gates lynch said i have been 
impressed by the initiative and ability of malagasy women to 
organize and run a business there are still many poor people it 
will take several years before some of the new enterprises will 
benefit everyone but there is a spirit of hope in the air 
madagascar formerly the malagasy republic is one of the 
worlds poorest countries with an annual per capita income of 163 
why are women taking the lead in setting up small industries 
thats the big question said vero rasendratsirofos mother 
elyett maybe its cultural girls learn to be in charge very 
early taking care of their brothers and sisters they fight 
harder but you know i am a woman 
monique ralimandy quickly moved from making and selling dolls in 
1978 to decorating homes and offices 
in 1986 she took a collection of dolls and baskets to france to 
test export opportunities she sold out and got help from french 
and canadian agencies to set up workshops 
i didnt know the technique only the design she said as 
she couldnt produce on a large scale she looked for a niche and 
found a good market for elaborately designed not cheap but 
affordable clothes for young girls 
most malagasy women learn to sew as small children so labor was 
no problem but the competition from other countries made quality 
control essential 
they have to get it into their heads that quality comes 
first ralimandy said 
ralimandys brother a doctor visits daily to provide free 
medical examinations some of the women earn 70000 malagasy francs 
monthly 45 twice the minimum wage depending on their output 
they are not required to work every day 
workers at atelier vero also work as they please to a degree 
our people are farmers at heart and some leave during the 
harvest season said vero rasendratsirofo 
she hopes to expand and sell her ceramic ware to other indian 
ocean islands 
monique ralimandy is optimistic about madagascars future 
there is great potential in madagascar for the export of 
confections she said two years ago we thought there was no 
future for textiles

with one eye on the audience and another on the 
competition movie executives continue to shuffle summer release 
dates confident that lastminute feints and gambits will bring 
their films the largest possible box office 
patrick swayzes road house once set for february and then 
june has previewed to test audiences so well it now will launch 
the summer sweepstakes on may 19 a week before harrison ford 
appears in indiana jones and the last crusade 
another former june release clint eastwoods pink cadillac 
has moved to may 26 thereby avoiding a clash with ghostbusters 
ii meanwhile the new james bond movie license to kill with 
timothy dalton and lethal weapon ii with mel gibson are 
heading for a july 14 showdown 
in perhaps the seasons bloodiest duel paramount pictures and 
new line cinema are juggling the august openings of their 
respective horror films friday the 13th part viii and 
nightmare on elm street 5 hopeful that the first to debut will 
make the biggest turnstile killing 
since a strong summer can make a movie companys entire year 
the studios have stockpiled their most commercial films for the 
coming months the resulting cinematic gridlock means that some 
distributors have completely fled the summer saving their better 
projects for less crowded times 
there may not be as many titles in sheer bulk but in quality 
of titles going in this summer is as competitive as we have 
seen said barry london president of paramounts motion picture 
group 
nevertheless independent distributor hemdale believes theres 
room for stylish foreign film such as englands shag 
the blockbusters are fantasies said martin rabinovitch 
hemdales executive vice president in charge of marketing 
theyre not about real things that happen so audiences will be 
ready for a real personal film such as shag 
by releasing indiana jones as the first of the wouldbe 
blockbusters paramount could control some of the nations best 
movie screens and dominate the entire summer campaign 
besides indiana jones three others will open virtually 
unopposed pink cadillac and star trek v the final 
frontier on june 9 and ghostbusters ii on june 16 the 
muchtalked about batman opening june 23 will be combating 
only one lesser title the light comedy honey ive shrunk the 
kids 
but at some point you cant move out of the way and you have 
to open in the face of some other competition because you want to 
be in the summer and take advantage of the holiday audience 
said si kornblit universal pictures executive vice president of 
worldwide marketing universals renegades starring lou 
diamond phillips will open on june 2 amid a firestorm of other 
major releases 
since the average moviegoer rarely sees two films in one 
weekend its crucial that releases be scattered evenly and that 
similar films never open against one another thus studios watch 
their rivals with undivided attention the wrong release date can 
kill even the biggest massappeal project 
if one studio makes a change the other follows said john 
krier president of exhibitor relations co its checkers 
new line distributors of the hulk hogan actionadventure film 
no holds barred knows all about that kind of gamesmanship 
we were going to open no holds barred on memorial day weekend 
when it was just indiana jones and thats all said mitchell 
goldman new lines distribution president but when warner bros 
decided to move in there with their clint eastwood film and fox 
and mgm threw in a picture we decided to drop back a week 
in one of the seasons more fearless moves orion will present 
great balls of fire a movie about rocker jerry lee lewis on 
june 30 thats the opening day for the karate kid iii with 
ralph macchio one of summers most anticipated titles and the 
debut of spike lees do the right thing 
what we have that nobody else has is an absolute original the 
only musical in the marketplace said charles glenn executive 
vice president of marketing for orion which will distribute 
great balls of fire 
if you go to a multiplex theater and theyre showing karate 
kid and batman you have another choice a picture thats 
different thats rock and roll 
showing similar daring cinecom will introduce its comedy 
scenes from the class struggle in beverly hills on may 31 
halfway between indiana jones and star trek v 
late summer is loaded with serious movies such as the underwater 
extravaganza the abyss and a variety of other actionadventure 
titles so universal is banking that audiences will crave a 
spirited comedy such as ron howards parenthood starring steve 
martin and opening aug 11 
some of the summer blockbusters will play through the summer 
but they will be on the decline said universals kornblit 
after a rash of license to kill and lethal weapon ii were 
going to come in with some great counterprogramming and we think 
parenthood will be the big movie at the end of the summer

the chairman of the american stock exchange says 
he will leave the nations thirdlargest stock market stronger 
than ever when he steps down to try to build a large 
communications company 
arthur levitt jr announced thursday he was resigning after 11 
years at the exchange which has attempted to stem the loss of 
business to its bigger wall street competitors by expanding into 
innovative new securities 
levitt 58 said he would remain at the exchange until a 
successor was named and that a search committee had been formed he 
said he plans to expand his threeyearold levitt communications 
inc 
i believe the american exchange today is stronger than ever in 
its history levitt told a news conference at the exchange in 
lower manhattan i believe the staff is better the quality of 
listed companies is stronger 
the amex which caters to mediumsized companies is far 
outpaced in volume by the new york stock exchange and the national 
association of securities dealers overthecounter market traded 
electronically nationwide 
the amex grew from an average daily volume of 39 million shares 
traded when levitt took over in 1978 to 994 million shares last 
year but the number of companies traded has fallen from 1004 to 
895 currently 
the exchange dates to the 1790s when its brokers traded 
unlisted securities on the streets of lower manhattan while others 
moved indoors it was known as the new york curb exchange until 
1953 when its present name was adopted 
levitt said he would enlarge levitt communications which has 
revenue of about 16 million and owns 33yearold roll call a 
twiceweekly washington newspaper delivered to the white house and 
98 percent of the nations congressmen 
the company in april agreed to acquire bampb enterprises inc 
which owns the publisher of stagebill a magazine distributed at 
performing arts centers in new york and washington 
levitt president of a shearson lehman hutton predecessor 
shearson hayden stone inc from 196978 said he planned other 
media aquisitions and quite possibly would seek to enter daily 
print journalism 
art has been doing this for 11 years i think hes 
accomplished the goals he set out for himself said jeffrey b 
lane an amex board member and president of shearson lehman hutton 
inc i think hes leaving the exchange in a strong position 
a search committee composed of present and former exchange board 
members will choose a successor to levitt 
under levitt the amex introduced index options including one 
based on an index of foreign stocks that begins trading friday the 
securities and exchange commission also has approved plans for the 
trading of socalled baskets of stocks on the amex 
the exchange undertook the options innovations to give the 
exchange another avenue of business although industry observers 
say amex remains far behind the chicago board of options in that 
area 
i think we have carved out a very specific place in the us 
for emerging growth companies the midrange companies levitt 
said 
average daily trading volume of the amexs 895 listed companies 
was 1149 million shares in april average daily volume is 1619 
million shares for the nyses 1680 listed companies and 1333 
million for about 5080 issues traded on the national 
overthecounter market 
the american exchange in 1988 reported net income of 26 
million on revenue of 1028 million compared with profits of 83 
million and revenue of 1145 million in 1987 amexs most 
profitable year 
the amex always has had the difficulty of being the little 
brother in the same city as the big brother said julius w 
peake who heads a capital markets consulting firm and studies the 
nations exchanges 
it used to be considered the training ground for stocks that 
were not yet qualified to make the big board but in last 15 years 
nasdaq has dwarfed the amex

already bought 76 percent of stock in the doughnut maker which 
owns or franchises more than 1780 shops and reported earnings of 
135 million on sales of 1128 million last year 
dunkin donuts vice president richard n hart jr said there was 
little reaction to the letter 
mr rosenberg will review the letter with his board at some 
point hart said 
dunkin donuts has implemented a shareholders rights plan and 
an employee stock ownership plan both aimed at thwarting an 
unfriendly takeover 
kingsbridge has said its options include buying more shares of 
dunkin donuts proposing a merger mounting a hostile takeover or 
waging a proxy battle for control of the board 
hopefully theyll agree to sit down at the table with us so 
we can sort it out said eric w evans a kingsbridge spokesman 
dunkin donuts stock rose to 3962 a share thursday on the 
overthecounter market up from 3475 wednesday 
theyre involved and they obviously want to stay involved so 
time will tell how serious they are said roger lipton an 
analyst with landenburg thalmann in new york who follows dunkin 
donuts 
i think managements made it clear theyre going to resist 
strongly lipton said bob rosenberg doesnt want to work for 
someone else

farmers who ran out of hay to feed their 
livestock during last summers drought may face a more serious 
shortage this summer iowa secretary of agriculture dale m cochran 
warns 
the depletion of our hay stocks combined with poor pasture 
conditions could lead to serious shortages of livestock feed this 
summer cochran said thursday 
the nations hay supply dropped by 10 million tons in 1989 and 
severe droughtinduced shortages in some midwestern states have 
caused iowa hay prices to skyrocket agriculture officials said 
the nations farmers had 1763 million tons of hay on hand as of 
may 1 1989 down from 2735 million tons at the same time in 1988 
according to figures released by the us agriculture department 
we had larger hay supplies on hand last year but they were 
quickly exhausted during the drought cochran said continued 
dry weather may cause this years smaller stocks to be depleted 
much further 
iowas hay stock fared better than those of its neighboring 
states with 102 million tons on may 1 compared with 134 million 
last year the department said 
some neighboring states are down substantially and that is 
putting a lot of pressure on hay prices in iowa said bernie 
janssen of the iowa department of agriculture droughtwise they 
ended up worse than we did 
janssen said hay prices in iowa soared to an average 96 a ton 
as of midapril doubling from 48 in april 1988 
iowas average hay price is much higher along the borders of 
neighboring states such as south dakota minnesota and wisconsin 
where hay stocks were significantly depleted last year because of 
the drought janssen said 
those states also didnt have as many setaside acres from 
conservation reserve programs on which to plant hay 
they didnt produce a lot of hay last year and had to use up a 
lot of the hay they had on hand janssen said 
south dakotas hay stocks plummeted 15 million tons from 277 
million tons on may 1 1988 to 117 million this spring minnesota 
is down to 626000 tons of hay on hand from 148 million tons last 
year while north dakota dropped from 134 million in 1988 to 
442000 in 1989 
hay supplies in wisconsin are down 1 million tons falling to 
887000 tons 
theyre down a lot so consequently if youre selling hay in 
iowa it has really helped keep iowa hay prices up here janssen 
said 
he said the national hay stock figures this year included all 48 
states in the continental united states of which only 11 showed an 
increase in hay stocks most of the increase was on eastern 
seaboard states he said 
no 1989 production estimates for corn soybeans and other major 
springplanted crops were included in thursdays report the usda 
will issue projections for those crops later in the growing season

the us dollar surged to an eightmonth high today 
against the japanese yen in tokyo while the key index on the tokyo 
stock exchange declined 
the dollar ended the week at 13580 yen up 125 yen from 
thursday it was the dollars highest closing rate since it closed 
at 13603 yen on sept 5 
a dealer with sumitomo bank said the dollars rise was triggered 
by a considerable amount of dollarbuying by institutional 
investors from aboard and a japanese officials remark tolerating 
the dollars rise 
finance minister tatsuo murayama told a news conference today 
that the dollar had risen partly because of its usual strength at 
the time of an emergency such as confusion in the panamanian 
presidential election 
president bush on thursday ordered nearly 1900 us troops to 
panama to protect americans there from violence following the 
countrys disputed presidential election 
the us currency is often regarded as a safe haven in times of 
international tension 
on the stock market the nikkei stock average of 225 selected 
issues which gained 8914 points on thursday lost 21516 points 
or 063 percent to finish the week at 3386633 volume on the 
markets first section was estimated at 750 million shares the 
same as thursday 
uncertainties over who will be japans next prime minister and 
when the nations key interest rate will be hiked combined to 
create a waitandsee mood among many market participants said

the words savings and loan often 
follow troubled or shaky in news reports these days so at 
least a dozen western thrifts are changing to the more 
solidsounding bank 
this week glendale federal savings amp loan association a solid 
thrift and one of the nations five largest became glendale 
federal bank its federal insurance is unchanged indeed very 
little will change except signs and stationery 
but at a time when onethird of us thrifts are expected to be 
taken over by the federal government to avert failure management 
sees solid advantage in disassociating itself from the weak part of 
the industry 
using the word bank conveys a solid image consistent with 
our reputation said norman m coulson glendale federals 
chairman and chief executive 
you may think this is sort of in the mickey mouse category 
but from a marketing point of view it has value said peter 
treadway an analyst at smith barney upham harris amp co in new 
york i think john q public may slightly be more reassured 
perception is no small matter 
the government reported thursday that savers nationwide withdrew 
85 billion from the nations thrifts in march even though the 
vast majority of those deposits are fully covered by federal 
insurance 
thrift executives discussing the matter generally say worries 
about the industrys image are a secondary reason for the change 
they say the main motive is that sampls are striving now to 
compete with commercial banks offering consumer services like 
checking accounts and car loans and its believed that most people 
think such services come from banks rather than thrifts 
for the institution the switch requires little effort it must 
persuade the federal home loan bank board to shift it from a 
savings and loan charter to the virtually identical savings bank 
charter 
such a switch leaves the institution in the federal savings amp 
loan insurance corp which is essentially insolvent and the target 
of president bushs hotly debated rescue proposal 
some thrifts have sought to move to the federal deposit 
insurance corp the stronger fund that insures banks but congress 
has slapped a moratorium on such moves in an effort to preserve the 
fslic 
twelve sampls in california arizona and nevada have received 
approval to adopt the bank name since the start of 1988 according 
to a list provided by the bank boards regional office in san 
francisco 
elsewhere in the country many others have applied for such 
changes said bank board spokesman bill fulwider in washington he 
was unable to provide an exact number 
among the california sampls adopting the bank name was american 
savings the biggest thrift ever seized by federal regulators

democratic congressional leaders are hoping 
political pressure will convince president bush to scuttle plans to 
veto legislation raising the minimum wage but an administration 
official says bush will not budge 
a veto would send a signal to workers and the more than 80 
percent of americans who support a minimum wage increase that 
george bush doesnt care rep augustus hawkins dcalif said 
thursday he and the members of his party can judge the impact of 
that decision in 1990 
hawkins chairman of the house education and labor committee 
commented shortly after the house voted 247172 in favor of raising 
the hourly minimum wage from 335 to 455 by october 1991 
the legislation drafted by a housesenate conference committee 
could clear the senate as early as next week and then will be 
forwarded to bush 
shortly after the house vote labor secretary elizabeth dole 
said democrats were wasting a chance to raise the minimum wage by 
their refusal to accept bushs offer of a more modest increase to 
425 by january 1992 and she said any attempts to change bushs 
stance would fail 
house democrats said no to a compassionate reasonable 
increase in the minimum wage mrs dole said instead it 
appears there will be no increase the house insisted on sending 
president bush a bill that would cost hundreds of thousands of 
americans the opportunity to work a bill he most certainly will 
veto 
the confrontation will be the first between the congress and 
bush on domestic policy and neither side has backed down in a 
fight that has gained symbolic meaning far beyond the differences 
on the minimum wage 
administration officials have said bush will not allow democrats 
to seize the momentum on domestic policy by pushing a lengthy 
agenda that includes proposals to establish mandatory benefits the 
white house opposes 
while democrats have the votes to pass the measure in the 
senate they are short in both houses of congress of the twothirds 
majority needed to override bushs expected veto sponsors of the 
bill insist they will attempt to override but their chances appear 
dim 
the leadership plans a mock signing ceremony after senate 
passage as part of its effort to put pressure on bush who is also 
being urged to stage an elaborate veto ceremony in a community with 
a large number of lowwage workers 
the house debate thursday mirrored the discussion earlier then 
the chamber first passed hawkins bill 
democrats said bush was trying to help the wealthy by spending 
billions to bail out savings and loans and proposing new tax breaks 
on capital gains but was unwilling to compromise on an issue 
affecting 4 million working poor 
republicans argued that bush had made a reasonable offer and 
that only the provision in the administration proposal allowing new 
hires to be paid a subminimum wage for six months would prevent 
massive jobs losses if the minimum wage is increased 
there can be no further compromise that throws people out of 
work said rep steve bartlett rtexas president bush has 
offered the compromise 
in rejecting bushs offer democratic leaders said bushs 
proposed increase was too small and also assailed his training 
wage because the provision requires no actual training in their 
final bill democrats allowed workers with less than 60 days of 
work experience to be paid a subminimum

drivers who crash in a dodge spirit 4door 
sedan have the least protection against head injuries among seven 
vehicles tested so far this year the national highway traffic 
safety administration says 
the cars were smashed at 35 mph into a fixed barrier and the 
resulting stresses were measured by sensors on humanshaped dummies 
protected by seat belts or when sold as standard equipment air 
bags 
stresses on the head were reported as an index referred to as 
the head injury criterion 
the crash test of the spirit which is in the large and 
midsize car category produced a headinjury criterion of 1421 in 
the drivers position nhtsa said 
the spirit was the first 1989 model tested to exceed the maximum 
headinjury criterion of 1000 allowed by federal regulations in 
the required 30 mph barrier crash however nhtsas public testing 
is performed at 35 mph which produces higher results than the 
mandatory test 
other new test results by weight class produced these driver 
headinjury criteria 
subcompact cars dodge daytona 2door hatchback 399 honda 
civic crx 2door hatchback 750 
large and midsize cars ford thunderbird 2door 541 
nhtsa said the crash tests are the equivalent of a headon 
collision between two identical vehicles each moving at 35 mph or 
between one vehicle moving at 70 mph and a parked vehicle 
small differences in test results shouldnt be considered 
significant nhtsa said only one vehicle of each type is tested 
and slight variations in construction or test conditions could 
produce differing results in additional tests the agency said 
previous test results by weight class were 
subcompact mitsubishi mirage 4door sedan 960 
compact mitsubishi galant 4door sedan 971 
large and midsize eagle medallion 4door sedan 745 
automakers are required to crashtest their products for safety 
certification under federal regulation but the results are rarely 
made public 
nhtsa began its own assessment program for public release in 
1979

the alaska oil disaster is prompting congress 
to revisit an idea that has languished on capitol hill for 15 
years the creation of a governmentcontrolled fund to pay for an 
oil spills devastation 
the bush administration on thursday sent to a house panel a 
proposal for a 500 million emergency fund to deal with oil spill 
cleanup and recovery the money would come from a 13centabarrel 
fee on all domestic and imported petroleum 
as transportation secretary samuel skinner explained the details 
to members of the subcommittee on coast guard and navigation 
several panel members noted that the subject is far from new 
rep gerry studds dmass pointed out that similar legislation 
has been debated without attracting much interest in every congress 
since 1975 three times bills cleared the house but not the senate 
i hope were not going to reinvent the wheel weve had 
numerous hearings on this said rep donald young ralaska 
but the spill of 11 million gallons of oil from the exxon valdez 
tanker in alaskas prince william sound on march 24 and the 
problems that have surfaced since then in containing and cleaning 
up the oil have virtually ensured that similar legislation will 
pass this year some congressmen suggested 
it took a tragedy like the exxon valdez to cause the entire 
congress to focus on the issue said rep walter jones dokla 
chairman of the merchant marine and fisheries committee 
in addition to the administration bill the house is considering 
a slightly different measure sponsored by jones that calls for a 
300 million cleanup fund 
some provisions of the administration bill likely will be 
incorporated into jones bill one congressional staffer said a 
subcommittee vote already is scheduled for later this month 
the fund would be tapped only for costs beyond those for which 
the company or shipper is directly liable the administrations 
legislation establishes a 78 million liability ceiling while the 
jones bill sets a 60 million maximum 
legislation was introduced in the senate on wednesday by sen 
ted stevens ralaska calling for creation of a 500 million 
federal oil spill cleanup fund it too would be financed through 
a fee on domestic and imported oil 
the stevens legislation also would require the coast guard to 
respond to a major oil spill and would give the coast guard access 
to up to 150 million of the cleanup fund 
in more than a dozen congressional hearings since the exxon 
valdez spill congressmen have bemoaned the lack of industry and 
government preparedness to such an emergency 
skinner who has been the bush administrations point man on the 
alaska spill said when the exxon valdez ran aground the 
government had only a few million dollars available in oil spill 
recovery funds 
had that spill been caused by a company less welltodo than the 
exxon corp the government would have had to scramble for funds 
and ask congress for tens of millions of dollars to get the cleanup 
effort going skinner said 
estimates of the cost of the exxon spill the worst in us 
history ranged from about 100 million to many times that amount 
skinner said it was too early to predict the eventual total 
salaries for the thousands of workers cleaning the fouled alaska 
beaches alone run as high as 75000 an hour for 20hour work days 
skinner said 
the numbers are very big he continued indicating at one 
point that even the proposed 500 million cleanup fund might have 
been inadequate he suggested that something in the range of 500 
million to 1 billion should cover it 
the administration proposal would make 500 million available in 
the event of another major spill but skinner said the president 
would have the authority to exceed that amount the government 
could then seek additional fees from the industry

it could take up to three years to implement a 
ban on the appleripening agent alar even though the environmental 
protection agency expects to soon begin formal steps to prohibit 
its use 
we are going to do it and shortly probably within the next 
10 days epa spokesman albert heier said thursday 
consumer groups says the growth regulator presents a health 
risk especially to children and the epa has said inescapable 
laboratory evidence exists that alar triggered cancerous tumors in 
test mice 
nonetheless the epa the agriculture department and the food 
and drug administration have all pronounced apples safe for 
consumption an estimated 5 percent of the crop is treated with 
small amounts of alar 
the epa which previously said it could not justify an emergency 
ban of alar announced in february that it planned within 90 days 
to initiate more routine procedures to eliminate its use in the 
future that period elapsed without a formal rulemaking proposal 
processed apples institute inc the trade organization 
representing processors of apple products urged an immediate 
announcement by the epa of its action toward a ban in hopes it will 
send a loud and clear signal to dissuade growers from using the 
chemical even while its legal may is the month when many 
orchards are sprayed 
public fears about the use of alar by some growers have caused 
the sales of apple products such as juice and sauce to drop off 20 
percent from the same period last year said larry davenport 
executive director of the institute 
we know and all federal government agencies have reaffirmed 
that apples and apple products are safe said davenport but 
with the public hysteria and misinformation surrounding this issue 
it has been difficult for makers of apple juices and sauces to get 
the truth across about product safety 
he said processors have refused since 1986 to buy apples 
containing alar although small amounts have slipped through the 
screening process 
the banning process that could take at least 15 months at best 
and up to three years if contested 
alar the uniroyal chemical cos marketing name for daminozide 
is an organic acid that helps keep apples on the tree until they 
are ripe and also keeps them red and crisp for a longer period 
after harvest

opponents of the 6 billion seabrook nuclear 
reactor are seeking an emergency court order barring lowpower 
atomic tests at the embattled new hampshire plant 
a request for an immediate stay to block a lowpower license 
pending further judicial review was filed at the us circuit court 
of appeals here thursday by massachusetts the town of hampton 
nh the seacoast antipollution league and the new england 
coalition on nuclear pollution 
seabrook opponents are anticipating that the nuclear regulatory 
commission will reject their pleas for a regulatory stay and issue 
the license soon 
late thursday nrc counsel gregory alan berry recommended that 
the commissioners reject the stay request that issue is the last 
of a long series of regulatory obstacles that has held up the 
license for three years 
an emergency court order blocking the tests is critical to the 
opponents strategy of ensuring that the 1150megawatt reactor 
never operates commercially if the nrc grants the license and the 
court refuses an emergency stay seabrook operators could start and 
finish the lowpower tests before the full appeal is heard by the 
courts rendering the case moot 
lowpower operation can commence as soon as the license is 
issued therefore absent a stay lowpower operation will 
immediately cause severe environmental and financial harm to 
residents of new hampshire and massachusetts the opponents wrote 
in a 77page memorandum to the court 
seabrook officials have said they will begin lowpower tests 10 
days after the nrc authorizes operations a move that could come as 
early as monday 
the opponents asked the appeals court to rule on their emergency 
stay request before monday but there was no indication when a 
ruling would come said diane curran a washington attorney 
representing the new england coalition on nuclear pollution 
massachusetts deputy attorney general stephen a jonas said he 
believes the nrc will not issue the license until the court rules 
lowpower tests are a critical step toward commercial operation 
for the plant which new england utilities say is badly needed to 
meet the regions energy needs into the 21st century 
seabrook critics who believe the coastal towns near the plant 
could never be safely evacuated fear lowpower tests will provide 
momentum as seabrook pushes for a fullpower commercial license 
in court papers opponents argued that potential difficulties in 
evacuating nearby coastal communities in southern new hampshire and 
northeastern massachusetts coupled with the plants financial 
problems make it doubtful that seabrook will ever operate 
commercially therefore they said lowpower tests will 
unnecessarily contaminate the reactor with radioactivity vastly 
increasing the cost of dismantling 
its an exercise in selfgratification said massachusetts 
attorney general james m shannon in boston they want to do it 
because its going to make them feel good at a terrible 
environmental and economic cost to the people of this region 
as long as there remains the very real possibility that this 
plant will never go on line it is completely irrational to take 
this irreversible step he added 
issues the opponents list in their request for an emergency 
court order include an nrc rule change last year allowing lowpower 
tests without an emergency public alert siren system in place in 
nearby towns 
massachusetts forced seabrook officials to remove sirens in the 
bay state communities that fall within seabrooks 10mile 
evacuation zone plant officials since have developed a system of 
truck and helicoptermounted sirens to notify massachusetts 
residents of a seabrook emergency 
seabrook spokesman rob williams said plant officials would 
withhold specific comments until they saw the legal papers but he 
defended the atomic reactor and its safety 
theres never been a plant in history so much scrutinized and 
passed so many tests williams said this is a safe plant with 
outstanding individuals prepared to operate it

a top coast guard officer told exxon to 
study the use of powerful chemicals to break down the goo on 
beaches fouled by the companys oil spill a move likely to draw 
opposition from environmentalists 
meanwhile a newspaper reported thursday that joseph hazelwood 
the fired skipper of the tanker exxon valdez will not testify 
before the national transportation safety board and will try to get 
his june 20 trial transferred out of valdez 
coast guard vice adm clyde robbins the ranking federal 
official in the spill zone said thursday that the chemicals 
called dispersants may have to be used on the rocky island 
shores of prince william sound because other cleansing methods have 
proven ineffective 
im not hot on dispersants but i think weve got to look at 
it robbins said 
he told exxon to develop a plan to use the dispersants and 
submit it for federal review 
dispersants are chemicals that are sprayed onto the oil break 
the oil down and thin it out then allow it to be washed away by 
the tides environmentalists say they may harm marine life and 
remain in the water for long periods 
the alaska department of environmental conservation said the 
methods used to clean the beaches to date are not efficient at 
removing this oil which is trapped in the soil or trapped 
within the shoreline sediment more effective methods neeed to be 
used 
attorney dick madson was quoted in the fairbanks daily 
newsminer as saying that hazelwood 42 had provided information 
in writing to the ntsb which is to begin its hearings tuesday in 
anchorage 
hazelwood is accused of three misdemeanor counts that include 
operating the 987foot vessel while drunk he was in command of the 
tanker march 24 when it slammed into a reef about 25 miles off 
valdez and leaked more than 10 million gallons of crude into prince 
william sound 
i think fairbanks is the best place to have this trial there 
are no close ties to the fishing industry here madson said 
fairbanks alaskas secondlargest city has strong ties to the 
oil industry with about half of the citys 950 millionayear 
economy stemming from oil 
hazelwood faces a maximum penalty of 27 months in jail and 
11000 in fines if convicted of all charges he is also the 
subject of a felony grand jury investigation in anchorage 
in other developments 
officials said thursday that 14 exxon cleanup workers became 
temporarily ill from inhaling oil fumes and received medical 
emergency treatment forcing a halt in part of the alaska oil spill 
cleanup 
the workers were taken ill tuesday in the port chatham area of 
the kenai peninsula and treated at a nearby medical center and 
discharged wednesday 
the symptoms included nausea skin irritation respiratory 
complaints and burning eyes said officials of the interagency 
center for disaster assistance work in the area is suspended until 
respirators are obtained officials said 
authorities said more than 20 tons of animals that have been 
killed by the spill are being held in deep freeze while exxon and 
government officials try to agree on a way to dispose of the 
carcasses 
the dead animals include more than 9400 birds and 600 sea 
otters along with 28 bald eagles 
exxon wants to use hospital incinerators but residents say they 
worry air quality would suffer and officials are uncertain if 
incineration would require exemptions from environmental 
regulations 
exxons overall proposal for cleaning up the spill calls for 
5000 people scouring the shores by midsummer with 364 miles of 
beaches cleaned by sept 15 thus far the cleanup has cost the 
company nearly 100 million according to exxon executives

in a journey that took them to the heart of 
capitalism a chinese delegation visited several us futures 
exchanges this week in hopes of creating socialiststyle 
commodity markets back home 
their signing today of an agreement with the chicago board of 
trade to establish a beijingbased training program for chinese 
traders is yet another sign of the chinese governments willingness 
to bend the communist line to accomodate useful freemarket 
concepts 
under the agreement cbot personnel will spend up to one month 
each year in the chinese capital to teach intensified courses on 
futures markets and trading techniques the cbot said the 
chinese will send economists to chicago for a workstudy program on 
the cbot floor 
we will adapt the futures market from the western style into 
socialist style a combination of the two systems said lu jian 
guang the only englishspeaking member of the fourman group 
and although professional speculators and highrisk futures 
contracts probably wont be part of the first chinese grain 
exchange theres no telling how far things could go once the 
bidding begins 
it all depends on the outside environment political reforms 
as well as economic reforms lu said thursday 
a chinese commodity market would be unique in the communist 
world said david granick a professor of economics at the 
university of wisconsin 
so far as i know ive never read of nor heard any talk of 
commmodity markets in any communist country he said 
the free market reigns supreme on the chicago board of trade 
the worlds oldest and largest commodity market where traders 
compete aggressively sometimes violently to buy and sell 
contracts for future deliveries of commodities ranging from 
soybeans to treasury bonds 
the new agreement expands a deal struck between the board of 
trade and the international trade research institute of chinas 
ministry of foreign economic relations and trade in april 1986 to 
exchange visitors with an eye toward developing some sort of 
commodities market in china 
the chinese initiated the exchange because they wanted to gain 
a fuller understanding of the nature and workings of futures 
markets said pat catania the board of trades marketing 
director 
catania said the chinese have tried futures trading in such 
commodities as corn sugar and tin in markets in chicago new york 
and london 
a futures market functions as an insurance policy for producers 
and consumers of agricultural commodities such as wheat or cattle 
it allows these commercial players to lock in prices in advance 
thus protecting themselves from price swings caused by weather 
problems plant disease or other disasters 
the board of trade began its life 140 years ago as a place for 
commercial grain players to both make deals and deliver goods but 
no one takes physical delivery of grain there any more 
most contracts are settled in cash a feature that invites 
professional speculators to play the markets and has earned the 
exchange and other futures markets a reputation as glorified 
casinos 
lu said chinas first grain exchange which probably will be 
located in the agricultural hunan province would hark back to the 
early days of the board of trade grain farmers and grain users 
would use the exchange to agree in advance on prices but 
individual speculators would be barred 
he would not predict a startup date for the first chinese 
commodity market

sears roebuck and co is continuing negotiations 
to sell its landmark headquarters but the company would like to 
keep most major operations based in the chicago area chairman 
edward a brennan says 
these are our roots brennan said we have been here 
almost since the beginning 
sears hopes to announce in june where its 6000employee 
merchandising group will be relocated but is nowhere near making 
a determination now brennan told reporters after the companys 
annual meeting thursday 
all i can say is that were looking very hard at all of the 
alternatives brennan said the truth is that we really dont 
have all of the costs laid out 
sears would need at least 1 million square feet to house the 
merchandise group space that would be greater than most of the 
parcels we own in the chicago area brennan said 
state economic development officials have reportedly offered 
sears sites near ohare international airport and in hoffman 
estates 
the merchandise group is currently housed in the sears tower 
which the retailer plans to sell as part of a restructuring program 
announced last fall 
concerning the sale of the sears tower the worlds tallest 
building located in the heart of chicago brennan would only say 
negotiations are proceeding 
he called wednesdays discussions with illinois gov james r 
thompson and chicago mayor richard m daley concerning a site for 
the merchandise group excellent and said illinois officials 
were supportive in trying to keep the sears subsidiary in the state 
we intend to meet with the governor and the mayor again 
probably within the next two weeks to three weeks brennan said 
we hope to be able to make a decision as we move into the month 
of june 
he would not discuss incentives nor would he compare them to 
those offered by other states 
while brennan reiterated the companys position that it would 
prefer to remain in the chicagoland area he said the retailer 
has a responsibility to its shareholders to look at all of the 
options based on comparisons of land costs the costs of 
relocation and taxes 
among the cities vying to land the merchandise group are dallas 
charlotte nc and kansas city mo 
brennans news conference followed the companys first annual 
meeting since it announced last october that it would sell the 
sears tower move the merchandise group to new and cheaper 
quarters offer more brandname products and shift to an everyday 
lowpricing strategy for its stores

the federal government should revamp its system 
for forcing improvements in car fuel economy and hold all 
automakers to the same percentage improvement each year ford motor 
cos chairman says 
i think people are being very misguided in thinking they are 
helping the environmental question by ramping up the fuel 
economy donald petersen said thursday after the no 2 us 
automakers annual meeting 
petersen said corporate average fuel economy standards are a 
real penalty to ford and industryleader general motors corp 
because of its reliance on smaller cars chrysler corp has had 
little trouble in the past meeting federally mandated fuel 
standards 
an alternative we are suggesting he said would be to 
ask all manufacturers to achieve an equal percentage improvement in 
xnumber of vehicles 
petersen said ford should be ready within five years to put on 
the road a fleet of cars powered by a variety of fuels 
we are negotiating with the state of california right now to 
provide them with a fleet of 2500 flexible fuel vehicles 
petersen said adding that such a fleet could be ready well before 
1995 
there has been increasing debate recently about the use of fuels 
other than gasoline to power cars and trucks spurred in part by 
rising oil prices and concern about vehicle emissions contributing 
to a global warming trend 
much of the effort has been concentrated on use of methanol 
which would require substantial changes in automobile engineering 
research into alternative fuels is facing a dilemma petersen 
said 
oil companies dont want to commit large resources to develop 
alternative fuels because automakers havent developed vehicles 
that can use them he said automakers havent made vehicles that 
can use alternative fuels because oil companies havent developed 
the fuels 
flexiblefuel vehicles are an obvious way around the chicken 
and egg problem petersen said 
during thursdays meeting the rev louis johnson of detroit 
urged petersen and the board of directors to cut all connections 
with south africa which is limited to licensing the use of the 
ford nameplate on vehicles made by samcor a successor to fords 
manufacturing operations in south africa 
ford withdrew its financial presence from south africa beginning 
in late 1987 by donating and selling its portion of samcor to 
employees and the corporation 
the company continues to sell vehicles with ford nameplates in 
south africa spokesman al chambers said and some are sold to the 
government 
since the companys products are still available the 
withdrawal amounts to corporate camouflage johnson said 
petersen said the company decries the segregationist policies of 
the south african government but keeping the automaker in 
business rather than selling it off two years ago was the proper 
course to take 
thursdays meeting also saw two greatgrandsons of founder henry 
ford assume important committee posts within the company 
edsel ford ii and his cousin william clay ford jr members of 
fords board of directors since january 1988 were appointed to the 
automakers executive and audit committees 
the ford family controls about 40 percent of the companys stock

ogilvy group inc today said it has begun talks 
with britains wpp group plc which has made a 50ashare takeover 
offer for the american advertising company and indicated its 
willingness to increase the bid 
ogilvy said there is no guarantee the discussions will produce 
an agreement on wpp acquiring ogilvy the worlds fifthlargest 
advertising concern based on 1988 billings 
takeover speculators on wall street have expected wpp to make a 
more generous offer wpps current offer values ogilvy at about 
750 million 
arbitragers earlier this week pushed ogilvys stock 2 above the 
latest wpp bid and in early overthecounter trading today ogilvy 
shares were up 87 cents at 5275 
wpp started its bidding at 45 a share and has maintained all 
along that it wanted to negotiate a friendly deal avoiding the 
possibly costly delays of a hostile transaction 
purchasing ogilvy would make wpp the londonbased owner of the 
us agency j walter thompson and the worlds thirdlargest 
advertising company roughly match in size industry leader saatchi 
amp saatchi co plc 
a statement issued by ogilvy said any agreement between the two 
which would have to be approved by both companies boards would be 
contingent upon certain conditions which were not specified

the stake held by salomon and shearson 
the deal will increase the debt on peabodys books but peabody

recapitalization and ownership change to have a major effect on the 
companys busienss

emerged a stronger company he said in a statement

included the cost of expansion programs and the payment of a 22 
billion dividend in 1987 james hill a newmont spokesman said

a federal judge said celebrity plus magazines 
cover looks too much like people weekly and ordered changes in 
celebritys cover format 
us district judge robert sweet issued a preliminary injunction 
thursday barring globe communications corp which has published 
celebrity plus since january 1987 from using elements of the 
people weekly cover 
time inc which owns people sued last month even after globe 
changed the dot over the i in celebrity to a star and added the 
words a globe publication to the cover 
we intend to further refine the logo said leonard m marks 
an attorney for globe that will end any possible complaint 
people has we really think people brought this action as a way to 
stifle competition but we intend to compete with them nose to 
nose 
not surprisingly people magazine took a different view 
at this stage the court has found that globe intentionally 
set out to mislead the public and to intentionally copy peoples 
cover format said betsy wagner a spokeswoman for people 
in a 23page decision sweet said time inc has shown that 
they will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted 
 
more than half of peoples sales at 179 per copy occur at 
newsstands supermarket checkouts and bookstores 
court papers said people sold 11 billion copies between 1981 
and 1988 
time inc which has published people since 1974 claimed that 
the cover of people plays a critical role in the newsstand sales 
and that the substantially consistent cover subject and cover 
format are used to attract readers who rely on the distinctive 
cover format in selecting the magazine 
celebrity plus a monthly that prints 250000 copies a month at 
195 each altered its cover format for its may 1989 issue to 
contain elements which were already a part of peoples cover 
format wrote sweet 
those elements included bordering the letters in the magazines 
name in a contrasting color and having the letters touch or blend 
into each other

wholesale prices rose a moderate 04 percent 
in april despite the sharpest increase in energy costs in nearly 
2 years the government said today 
the gain in the labor departments producer price index 
reflected a steep jump in gasoline prices counterbalanced by a 
substantial drop in auto prices and broad declines in food costs 
it followed an identical 04 percent gain in march and large 
backtoback 1 percent jumps in january and february 
because of the steep rises early in the year wholesale price 
inflation one stop short of retail advanced at a 9 percent annual 
rate in the first four months of 1989 
bond prices soared in early trading the treasurys key 30year 
bond a widelywatched barometer of inflationary speculation was 
up more than 20 per 1000 in face amount with its yield tumbling 
about a quarter point from 906 percent late thursday 
on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks 
rocketed more than 44 points higher in the first 20 minutes of 
trading by 11 am edt the dow was up 3629 points at 241917 
this is very good news but the inflation watch is not 
over said dirk van dongen president of the national association 
of wholesalerdistributors my concern is its dangerous to 
generalize longterm trends from any 30day snapshot we still have 
some sectors in the economy that are hot even though some have 
slowed 
in a separate report today the commerce department said 
business inventories in march rose 03 percent while sales were 
flat confirming earlier government statistics showing economic 
growth slowing 
economists were paying particular attention to the inflation 
rate for goods other than the volatile food and energy categories 
which edged down 01 percent in april following a 03 percent rise 
in march it was the first drop since an identical fall in october 
1987 
a 06 percent decline in food costs was the biggest since a 11 
percent decline in december 1987 and represented the first 
substantial price relief since last years drought 
the huge 72 percent rise in energy costs matched the increase 
in january 1987 energy prices have not risen more sharply in one 
month in 15 years 
the energy increase was almost entirely attributable to a 134 
percent climb in gasoline prices the steepest since january 1987 
fuel oil rose a comparatively moderate 06 percent after zooming 
168 percent in march natural gas prices advanced 19 percent 
the decline in food was led by a 159 percent drop in eggs 
vegetables fell 75 percent pork 36 percent fruit 27 percent 
and fish 13 percent the prices of turkeys rice and candy rose 
the biggest drop in categories other than food and energy came 
in autos where prices fell 28 percent the result of 
manufacturers incentives to lure customers into showrooms and 
revive slumping sales 
there were also declines in childrens clothing cosmetics 
magazines and tires prices rose for jewelry and electronic 
equipment 
the overall april increase left the producer price index for 
finished goods at 1130 meaning that a hypothetical selection of 
goods costing 100 in 1982 would have cost 113 last month up from 
11220 in march 
inflation measures earlier in the production process also showed 
moderation intermediate goods rose 04 percent in april following 
a 07 percent jump in march crude goods rose 06 percent following 
a 23 percent gain 
an example of the three processing levels would be finished 
wholesale bread intermediate flour and crude wheat 
the 9 percent annual rate of wholesale inflation so far this 
year is more than double the 4 percent price rise last year and 
four times the 22 percent gain in 1987 
analysts however are divided over whether inflation will 
continue accelerating later this year 
michael boskin president bushs chief economic adviser 
acknowledged earlier this week that we may see another bumpy 
month or two but he pointed out that the great bulk of the 
acceleration was due to the increased price of crude oil 
as oil prices stabilize they will no longer contribute to 
inflation boskin said in a speech to the national association of 
manufacturers 
stock and bond markets had been trading quietly most of the week 
as traders awaited todays report they worried that if the 
inflation number was too severe the federal reserve board would 
push interest rates higher to cool the economy and ease inflation 
pressure 
the feds open market committee which stepped up its fight 
against inflation in february after the bad news for january was 
released meets next tuesday to set monetary policy through june 
analysts generally expect the committee to leave policy unchanged 
the fed pushed up shortterm interest rates three percentage 
points between march 1988 and march 1989 and there is some evidence 
that its tightmoney moves are working 
job growth slowed in april as the unemployment rate jumped to 
53 percent from 50 percent in march retail sales for the month 
rose a modest 04 percent after two weak months

lower in early trading today on the chicago board of trade as 
weather factors took precedence over a bullishly construed crop 
report 
prices opened higher in reaction to thursdays agriculture 
department report which projected an 8 percent decline in 1989 
us winter wheat production due mainly to dry conditions and 
harsh winter weather in kansas 
forecasts for rain this weekend in the great plains and the 
midwest prompted the early selling but some observers said traders 
were unsure how to interpret the forecasts 
showers in the plains could be accompanied by high winds and 
hail so it might do more damage than good said joel karlin a 
research analyst with research department inc in chicago 
in the eastern corn belt cold wet weather has delayed planting 
to the point that more rain may be viewed as positive for prices 
karlin said 
in early trading wheat was cent to 3 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in may at 424 a bushel corn was cent to 
2 cents lower with may at 275 a bushel oats were unchanged to

the reason why the market is responding so positively to the

director of economic research at argus research corp the fact 
that we had just a 04 percent increase in producer prices despite 
the massive 7 percent rise in energy prices is a very good 
development it takes the pressure off the fed to consider 
tightening monetary policy even further 
however economists cautioned that despite indications of 
weakness in some areas the economy is still running at a high rate

president bush today proposed an 
open skies policy with the soviet union under which each 
nation would be permitted to overfly the others territory to 
monitor military activities 
in a major speech outlining his goal to welcome the soviet 
union back into the world order bush also said he would be 
willing to ease the jacksonvanik amendment a 17yearold law that 
ties trade concessions to with east bloc nations with those 
countries emigration policies 
the united states now has as its goal much more than simply 
containing soviet expansionism we seek the integration of the 
soviet union into the community of nations the president said in 
the text of a speech announcing his administrations policy 
principles for relations with moscow 
bush took a carrotandstick approach to the soviet union in his 
address to a commencement audience at texas aampm university saying 
he wanted the two superpowers to enjoy a friendship that knows no 
season of suspicion no chill of distrust 
as the soviet union moves toward greater openness and 
democratization as they meet the challenge of responsible 
international behavior we will match their steps with steps of our 
own he said 
ultimately our objective is to welcome the soviet union back 
into the world order 
bush called for revival of a 1950s proposal by president 
eisenhower that would have allowed each nation to fly unarmed 
inspection aircraft over the others territory which would open 
up military activities to regular scrutiny 
bush proposed that this neverimplemented open skies policy 
be expanded to include all nations in the east and west 
such unprecedented territorial access would show the world the 
meaning of the concept of openness he said the very soviet 
willingness to embrace such a concept would reveal their commitment 
to change 
en route here aboard air force one national security adviser 
brent scowcroft acknowledged to reporters that satellites conduct 
most of the intelligence surveillance today but he said the 
openskies use of aircraft would have some advantages in eeing 
below cloud cover 
and scowcroft said symbolically its very important 
because aerial surveillance would represent an abandonment of 
traditional secrecy by the soviets 
this speech and the next one are not designed to be catchy 
he said were in an unusual phase of history right now and 
the administration is trying to look ahead to end of the century 
and develop new policies 
as for the jacksonvanik law bush said he would work with 
congress for a temporary waiver of the restrictions on soviet 
trade status if the kremlin would codify a liberalization of 
emigration laws 
he said his administration would respond positively if the 
soviets also take positive steps 
these he said include reducing their military forces abroad 
tearing down barriers between eastern and western europe improving 
their human rights commitment and working with the west in 
positive practical not merely rhetorical steps to solving 
international regional disputes 
where there is cooperation there can be a broader economic 
relationship the president said ending discriminatory 
treatment of us firms would be a helpful step trade and 
financial transactions should take place on a normal commercial 
basis 
as he has in the past bush said he welcomed the soviet moves 
toward glasnost or openness and economic restructuring 
but he sounded a skeptical note saying these hopeful indeed 
remarkable signs should be viewed in the vein that western 
security is not predicated on hope it must be based on deeds we 
look for enduring ingrained economic and political change 
make no mistake a new breeze is blowing across the steppes 
and cities of the soviet union why not then let this spirit of 
openness grow let more barriers come down bush said 
he called for open emigration open debate open airwaves 
and said let the 19000 soviet jews who emigrated last year be 
followed by any number who wish to emigrate this year 
the jacksonvanik measure named for the late sen henry m 
jackson dwash and former rep charles vanik rohio denies the 
soviets a host of trade advantages including reduced tariffs 
unless they relax their restrictions on emigration of jews and 
others wishing to leave it was included in a 1972 trade law 
in advance of the speech american jewish groups gave a mixed 
reaction to bushs proposal to ease the measure 
its clearly a move that we would support said mark 
pelavin a spokesman for the american jewish congress we think 
that the changes that have taken place in the soviet union are 
changes we must recognize 
david harris of the american jewish committee said the move 
sends the right combination of signals on the one hand a 
continued american insistence on performance by the soviets on the 
other hand an american willingness to respond to such performance 
with flexibility 
the national conference on soviet jewry was more cautious 
our official position is we are against the waiver said 
spokesman jerry strober adding that his group is reassessing its 
view and may update it when its board of governors assembles in 
washington june 13 
strober said the conference recommends four criteria the soviets 
should meet before jacksonvanik is waived sustained and 
substantial jewish emigration resolution of longstanding 
refuseniks the promise to codify emigration law and specific time 
limitations on refusals for reasons of state secrecy 
the soviets have been allowing expanded emigration through 
casebycase decisions and the united states is looking for the 
less restrictive rules to be put into more formal regulations

unilever the anglodutch household products 
giant said friday its net profit rose 10 percent in the first 
quarter due to improvement in the companys operations outside 
europe 
the company said its profit for the first three months of the 
year came to 195 million pounds which is about 326 million or 
1044 pence a share compared with 178 million pounds or 953 
pence a share in the same period a year earlier 
sales rose 9 percent to 433 billion pounds about 72 
billion from 398 billion pounds a year earlier 
operating profit from unilevers european businesses was little 
changed at 205 million pounds about 342 million compared with 
207 million pounds a year earlier as mild weather cut into sales 
of some food and drink products while promotional costs for some 
detergent products increased 
in north america operating profit more than doubled to 66 
million pounds about 110 million from 32 million pounds helped 
by firsttime contributions from recent acquisitions of durkee 
industrial foods corp and pennant products inc a specialty 
bakery products maker 
profit in the first quarter of 1988 was depressed by the 
companys heavy investment to promote new detergent and dishwashing 
brands unilever said

the government on friday proposed setting 
exposure limits for a substance used for various construction tasks 
involving plastics and sealants and said the guidelines could 
prevent up to 23 cancer deaths a year 
the proposed limits on exposure to methylenedianiline resulted 
from the occupational safety and health administrations first 
attempt at mediated rulemaking a procedure which included a 
committee consisting of government industry and labor union 
representatives 
methylenedianiline known as mda is a potential carcinogen 
found in chemicals and plastics such as polyurethane foam and 
various coatings resins adhesives and sealants used in 
construction 
osha an arm of the labor department proposed setting an 
exposure limit of 10 parts of mda for every billion parts of air 
over an normal eighthour workday 
the proposed guidelines subject to public comment before they 
take effect also would require workers exposed to mda at half the 
acceptable level be monitored for potential health effects and 
provided training on limiting their exposure 
workers exposed to mda at half the acceptable limit or in 
greater amounts would be required to shower immediately after work 
and have their skin inspected for exposure prolonged exposure to 
mda turns skin yellow 
areas where the substance is used also would be regulated with 
employers required to provide workers with protective clothing and 
respiratory equipment and to keep detailed records of mda use 
osha which published the proposed limits in fridays federal 
register said about 4000 workers are exposed to mda in their 
jobs it would cost an estimated 82 million a year for all firms 
using mda in general industry to meet the limits and about 650000 
a year for construction employers to comply the government said 
the process that led to the osha action dates back to 1983 when 
osha and the environmental protection agency announced plans to 
limit exposure to mda osha subsequently determined the substance 
posed substantial risk to worker health and in 1986 formed the 
committee that after seven meetings drafted the proposed limits

london ap 
the us dollar rose friday against most major 
currencies in busy european trading despite what dealers said was 
strong and concerted intervention by central banks gold prices 
turned mixed 
the dollar hovered at a 30month high against the west german 
mark in late trading a 28month high against the french franc an 
18month high against the british pound and eightmonth highs 
against the japanese yen and the french franc 
dealers said central banks sold dollars after the us 
government reported us producer prices rose a modest 04 percent 
in april market forecasts had predicted a 07percent rise 
but despite repeated interventions by the us federal reserve 
aided by the west german british swiss french italian belgian 
and canadian central banks the dollar had lost little ground by 
the end of trading 
the dollars recovery was fueled bye last crusade ghostbusters 
ii the 
karate kid iii or star trek v the final frontier 
all of them have a fighting chance since all are sequels to 
films that earned more than 100 million in the united states and 
canada the film industry figures indiana jones and 
ghostbusters ii show the most promise for leading the pack 
along with a new version of batman starring michael keaton and 
jack nicholson 
there are other deja vu offerings in this sequel summer 
timothy dalton makes his second coming as james bond in 
license to kill mel gibson and danny glover return to their

what makes a 100 million grosser 
number one you need a broad opening in the summertime said 
richard lederer who does marketing warner bros and orion 
pictures you need anywhere from 1000 to 1500 theaters 
paramount has 2000 for indiana jones 
its important to open with a bang and continue to run for 
weeks you cant have a dropoff in the second or third week if a 
picture opens to medium business and starts to surprise its 
important to add theaters right away summer is the important time 
and its imperative to get as many theaters as possible 
most of the big winners are lighter fare since thats what is 
released during the summer strong dramas are usually held for 
december 
a survey of the 100 million movies of the past five years bears 
out lederers theories the only drama on the list is the academy 
awardwinning rain man which has earned 160 million since its 
release last december 
here is how the other 100 million movies of the past five years 
break down figures in millions from exhibitor relations co

as usual comedies will be prevalent during the 1989 summer 
eric the viking is a spoof from monty pythons terry jones 
with tim robbins john cleese and mickey rooney 
do the right thing is another outrageous comedy from spike 
lee school daze starring danny aiello 
uncle buck stars john candy and amy madigan in a john

when harry met sally is a courtship comedy from rob 
reiner stand by me with billy crystal and meg ryan 
the actionadventure junkies will find satisfaction in the 
summer fare aside from indiana jones james bond ghostbusters and

like turning over a rock you never know what 
might be exposed to the sunshine when you tip a political 
assumption on its side and get a good look at it 
ron utt did and what he found is not at all what he was supposed 
to find and because of that a currently popular political view has 
lost some of its credibility 
that political view often garnished with emotion is that a cut 
in the capital gains tax as proposed by president bush would 
enrich the rich at the expense of the poor 
the reasoning involved is that only those with big incomes are 
likely to have capital gains such as from stocks or real estate 
because those on limited incomes cannot afford such capitalistic 
luxuries 
isnt that what the earnings statistics show 
no says utt former deputy director of the office of management 
and budget and now a fellow at the conservative heritage 
foundation that might be what the statistics seem to show but 
only because of rather odd methodology he says 
what makes it appear that only the rich have capital gains and 
therefore can be the only beneficiaries of cuts in the capital 
gains tax is that every so often those on limited incomes are 
treated as if they were rich 
for many individuals even those on incomes of less than 
10000 capital gains realizations are infrequent occurrences and 
reflect a unique onetime event that pushes the taxpayer into 
higher brackets for one year 
in the next year the poor taxpayer might revert to the usual 
under10000 income but only after he or she has left an imprint 
on the previous years statistics and thereby helped prove an 
ersatz point 
utt explains realized capital gains tend often to be such 
nonrecurring events as the sale of a small business on retirement 
an elderly widow selling her home the sale of stock to pay for a 
childs education the sale of a small portfolio that might have 
represented the meager savings of a lifetime 
among these onetime capital gainers are spouses of broken 
marriages who might have put all their money into a home after 
which real estate values soared now they are selling and dividing 
the assets are they rich 
prominent among those who might have capital gains are the 
elderly who often sell their houses and move into smaller 
quarters in general they seek to live off their nest egg are 
they rich or only taxed as if they were 
in a heritage foundation paper supporting a cut in capital gains 
taxes and in an interview utt cited 1985 internal revenue service 
figures to show that those on small incomes pay a huge amount in 
capital gains taxes 
the chart shows those people with annual income of less than 
10000 other than from capital gains paid 353 billion in 
capital gains taxes or 2079 percent of all capital gains taxes 
paid in that year 
that amount was the largest for any income category other than 
for the unlimited over 200000 group even those with 
noncapital gains income of 150000 to 200000 paid only 87 
billion or 512 percent of the total 
it is extremely important says utt to measure recurring 
income or the income a taxpayer can expect year to year 
when the distinction between recurring income and nest egg 
income is made he says it can be seen that realized capital 
gains actually are distributed rather evenly throughout the income 
distribution 
but if you include those who are rich for just one year 
then of course the statistics will tend to show that only those who 
are fairly well off pay capital gains taxes

the labor department reported today that the producer price

director of economic research at argus research corp the fact 
that we had just a 04 percent increase in producer prices despite 
the massive 7 percent rise in energy prices is a very good 
development it takes the pressure off the fed to consider

texas instruments inc on friday announced the 
creation of a privately held joint venture with taiwans acer inc 
to produce advanced memory chips in taiwan 
the venture will give dallasbased texas instruments its first 
memorychip production capacity in the asiapacific region outside 
of japan the company said 
it also will provide acer taiwans largest computer 
manufacturer an assured source of dynamic random access memory 
chips or drams for its personal computers peripherals and 
communications products the company said 
drams are tiny silicon circuits used in computers and other 
electronic devices 
representatives of both companies announced the venture friday 
in taipei taiwan construction of the 250 million wafer 
fabrication plant is scheduled to start in september with initial 
production in mid1991 
output from the facility will be sold exclusively to texas 
instruments which will guarantee up to 50 percent of the total to 
acer 
acer will own 74 percent of the company while ti will own 26 
percent ti will have an option to buy up to 51 percent during the 
next five years

the company and ti will provide a lesser amount of money plus the 
technology to build and run the plant 
customers are looking for a longterm source of product and 
they want closer relationships with their memory suppliers said 
william p pat weber president of tis semiconductor group 
this joint venture provides that kind of relationship between 
acer and ti he said it will give us some muchneeded 
production capacity in a key location and it spreads the financial 
risk inherent in building new increments of capacity 
stan shih acers chairman and chief executive officer will 
serve as chairman of the joint venture

futures prices of grain and soybeans closed mixed 
friday on the chicago board of trade on a combination of bearish 
weather forecasts and bullish signals from the agriculture 
departments latest crop report 
wheat futures ended lower the corn and soybean markets both 
finished with higher prices for oldcrop deliveries and losses in 
the newcrop contracts 
the drop in wheat prices reflected the arrival of badly needed 
rain in the parched winter wheat fields of the southern plains 
these rains are going to do good said dale gustafson an 
analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc in chicago 
the usda in a crop report issued after thursdays close of 
trading estimated an 8 percent decline in 1989 winter wheat 
production from last years level but the the market had already 
discounted the crop damage and traders focused instead on the 
weather 
the usda lowered to 135 million bushels from 145 million bushels 
its projection for the aug 31 us soybean stockpile which 
supported prices for beans from last years crop 
strong spot markets boosted the oldcrop corn contracts while 
forecasts for favorable planting weather this weekend prompted 
selling of newcrop corn and soybeans 
at the close wheat was 1 cents to 5 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in may at 422 a bushel corn was 1 cent 
lower o 2 cents higher with may at 278 a bushel oats were 2 
cents to 5 cents higher with may at 189 a bushel soybeans were

former british columbia 
premier bill bennett was found innocent friday of insider trading 
in shares of doman industries 
provincial court judge wallace craig also acquitted bennetts 
brother russell and herb doman president of the vancouver 
islandbased forest company in canadas highestprofile insider 
trading case 
ive said all along that ive done nothing wrong doman said 
after the verdict now i can go on and run my business 
the three prominent businessmen drawn together by ties to 
horseracing and the social credit political party faced up to 
100000 in fines and five years in jail 
each was charged with one count each of selling shares using 
information not disclosed to the public russell bennett and doman 
also faced one count of buying shares on the basis of inside 
information doman faced one count each of tipping someone to buy 
and sell using inside information 
the bennetts still face insider trading charges in toronto 
bill bennett 57 was british columbia premier from 1975 until 
retiring in may 1986 his father wac bennett led the 
provincial government for 20 years ending in 1972 
judge craig said prosecutors had failed to prove the case beyond 
a reasonable doubt 
not only has the prosecution failed to prove beyond a 
reasonable doubt that bill bennetts sale of domans shares was 
as a result of herb doman giving him inside information it has 
established at least on a balance of probabilities that he made the 
decision to do so before he could possible have received any 
alleged tip he said

increase in energy prices the index measures prices at the 
wholesale level 
the market had expected a rise of as high as 1 percent 
investors decided the report meant that inflationary pressures 
were not building as suggested by last weeks unemployment report 
and that the federal reserve might not continue raising interest 
rates the april jobless report showed more people were out of work 
but at the same time hourly earnings climbed substantially 
the fear until now was not that the economy would overheat but 
that inflation would rise rapidly and keep the fed from making 
moves to ease credit said michael metz technical analyst for 
oppenheimer amp co now it looks like that has changed 
however economists cautioned that despite indications of 
weakness in some areas the economy is still running at a high rate 
of activity 
the number in no way implies that inflation is set to move 
lower on a permanent basis said james solloway director of 
economic research at argus research corp

the alar scare has already cost washington 
apple growers 90 million this year and slumping prices and sales 
reported friday indicate losses will be even higher 
sales dropped 15 percent last week while prices have slumped 
another 1 per box both attributed to continuing public concern 
over the possible health effects of the farm chemical 
the outlook is even gloomier because round two of the alar 
controversy is about to begin with more news reports a 
congressional hearing and movement by the us environmental 
protection agency toward banning the chemical 
bill dewitt of the wenatchee valley traffic association reported 
friday that outofstate shipments of washington apples were 12 
million 42pound boxes during the week that ended thursday 
that compared to nearly 15 million boxes the week before and 
nearly 17 million boxes the same week last year 
shipments to retailers are considered an accurate indicator of 
consumer sales 
tom hale president of the washington state apple commission 
has attributed the decline to retailers dropping their inventories 
until the impact of the latest alar battle becomes clear 
the industry is anxiously awaiting another alar report on the 
cbs television program 60 minutes scheduled for this sunday 
the shows story on the nrdc report in late february sparked the 
controversy 
the industry has contacted people interviewed for the second 
60 minutes story and believes it will be a negative piece 
its an attempt to offset the broad criticism the original 
segment had said hale who heads the promotion group for the 
states 5000 growers 
also set for next week are congressional hearings on food safety 
that will focus on alar and the epa announced thursday that it 
plans to begin formal steps to ban alar within 10 days 
the nrdc report concluded that eating apples treated with alar 
the trade name for daminozide increased cancer risk in children 
the industry has attacked the report as misleading and federal 
regulators have pronounced apples safe to eat but alarmed 
consumers have backed away 
alar is sprayed on apple trees in the spring and is used 
primarily to improve color and crispness and extend shelf life of 
red apples 
washington grows about half the nations apples but provides 88 
percent of the domestic production this time of year the states 
growers have been hardest hit by the controversy 
prices which were 13 to 14 per box just before the 
controversy erupted in late february have dropped to around 10 
per box in recent weeks said jeff main of the federalstate market 
news service in yakima 
with about 30 million boxes of red apples sold since late 
february the cost to washington growers about 90 million 
those losses are partially offset by increases in prices for 
much smaller supplies of golden delicious and granny smith apples 
warehouses in the state still have over 13 million boxes of red 
apples left in storage 3 million more than at this time last year 
if we dont sell all of these which is a possibility we will 
lose much more dewitt said 
earlier this week john rice president of the international 
apple institute estimated that the controversy had cost growers 
across the nation 100 million with another 100 million lost by 
juice and applesauce processors 
the sales slowdown also means that stored fruit which normally 
would have been sold a month ago is becoming unsuitable for 
supermarkets and must be diverted at a much lower price to juice 
and sauce makers

ogilvy group inc has begun talks with britains 
wpp group plc which has offered to buy the american advertising 
company for about 800 million but indicated it may increase its 
bid the companies said friday 
ogilvy said in disclosing the talks that there was no guarantee 
the discussions would produce an agreement on wpp acquiring ogilvy 
the worlds fifthlargest advertising concern 
a combination of wpp and ogilvy would create a company that 
would vie with saatchi amp saatchi co plc for the ranking as the 
worlds largest advertising company 
takeover speculators on wall street have expected wpp to make a 
more generous offer in an effort to avoid the costly delays and 
potential client losses that could occur due to a result of a 
hostile transaction 
in overthecounter trading friday ogilvy shares rose 125 a 
share to 5312 
analysts took a cautious approach toward interpreting the 
significance of the discussions 
andrew wallach who follows advertising agencies for drexel 
burnham lambert said it may be a signal that in all probability 
we will see an agreed transaction but he quickly added you 
cant rule out anything at this point 
fred anschel an analyst at dean witter reynolds inc said the 
ogilvy announcement suggests they have no other feasible options 
available to them ogilvy reportedly has considered seeking a 
friendly buyout by another company a managementled buyout or a 
recapitalization 
but another securities analyst speaking on condition that he 
not be identified said ogilvy management may be talking with wpp 
simply to gather information in advance of a regular board meeting 
set for tuesday 
a statement issued by ogilvy said any agreement between the two 
which would have to be approved by both companies boards would be 
contingent upon certain unspecified conditions 
in london wpp confirmed in a onesentence statement that 
discussions are in progress regarding the possible 
acquisition of ogilvy by wpp 
londonbased wpp the worlds thirdlargest advertising company 
and parent of the us agency j walter thompson opened the 
bidding for ogilvy two weeks ago when it proposed a friendly buyout 
at 45 a share earlier this week wpp said it would be willing to 
pay 50 a share 
ogilvy has about 16 million shares outstanding on a fully 
diluted basis making wpps current offer worth about 800 million 
purchasing ogilvy would make wpp nearly equal in size to 
industry leader saatchi amp saatchi saatchi had worldwide billings 
of 135 billion last year while wpp had 78 billion and ogilvy 
came in at 57 billion 
ogilvys ogilvy amp mather ad agency is recognized as one of the 
most famous names in advertising and counts among its clients 
american express seagram co and the kraft general foods unit of 
philip morris cos 
but analysts have faulted ogilvy for belowaverage operating 
margins ogilvy executives insist that margins in its advertising 
agency are near the industry average of about 10 percent but that 
its research operations have depressed companywide margins 
wpp is led by martin sorrell who is credited as the architect 
of the acquisition strategy that made saatchi the worlds biggest 
ad company 
after leaving saatchi he applied what he had learned in 
building wpp from a small maker of shopping baskets to a global 
consortium of advertising public relations sales promotion and 
marketing services companies 
his boldest move was two years ago when wpp successfully 
acquired jwt group inc the parent of j walter thompson and the 
smaller ad agency lord geller federico einstein and the public 
relations giant hill amp knowlton it was the first hostile 
acquisition in the american ad business and cost 566 million 
analysts say sorrell prizes ogilvys brand name and its 
strengths in europe where thompson is weaker they say ogilvy also 
would give sorrell a second global ad company to be run 
independently of thompson much as saatchi and other advertising 
behemoths run separate global ad networks

wholesale prices climbed a moderate 04 
percent in april despite a steep rise in gasoline costs the 
government said friday cheering financial markets and providing 
hope that inflation has stopped accelerating 
energy prices soared 72 percent propelled by the steepest 
onemonth increase in gasoline prices in nearly 2 years those 
rises were largely offset however by a broad fall in food prices 
the first real breather since last years drought and by a 
substantial decline in auto costs 
the news rallied stock and bond markets where traders said the 
report indicated the federal reserve boards yearlong campaign of 
fighting inflation with higher interest rates is working the dow 
jones average of 30 industrials surged 5682 points to close at a 
postcrash high of 243970 
this is an excellent report said economist bruce steinberg 
of merrill lynch i think it would be premature to declare 
victory over inflation but the report does suggest we wont see 
any more acceleration and that the fed is unlikely to tighten 
more 
but the business council a group of 65 chief executives from 
the nations largest corporations said friday they foresee little 
deceleration either 
the central view is that although the flareup in prices early 
in 1989 was an aberration price behavior will not improve 
appreciably until mid1990 the executives said in a report 
released at their semiannual retreat in hot springs va a posh 
resort town 
the april advance in the labor departments producer price index 
for finished goods one stop short of retail followed an identical 
04 percent gain in march and 1 percent jumps in january and 
february 
because of the steep rises early in the year wholesale prices 
increased at a 9 percent annual rate in the first four months of 
1989 thats more than double last years wholesale inflation of 4 
percent and four times the 22 percent rate in 1987 
however economists said much but not all of the 
acceleration this year is attributable to a onetime shock from a 
rise of more than 30 percent in the price of crude oil since the 
end of 1988 
well see an increase in energy prices next month but not 
of this magnitude said economist donald ratajczak of georgia 
state university our feeling is they will fall off in the second 
half of the year 
the huge 72 percent rise in energy costs last month was almost 
entirely attributable to a 134 percent climb in gasoline prices 
the steepest since january 1987 fuel oil prices rose a 
comparatively moderate 06 percent after zooming ahead 168 percent 
in march natural gas prices advanced 19 percent 
a 06 percent decline in food costs led by a 159 percent drop 
for eggs was the biggest since december 1987 vegetables fell 75 
percent pork 36 percent fruit 27 percent and fish 13 
percent the prices of turkeys rice and candy rose 
weve pretty much topped out on the drought ratajczak said 
barring another drought were going to get more upanddown 
rather than steady up 
economists were particularly encouraged by the april inflation 
rate for goods outside of the volatile food and energy categories 
those prices overall edged down 01 percent the first drop since 
october 1987 following a 03 percent rise in march 
the biggest drop came in autos where prices fell 28 percent 
the result of manufacturers incentives to lure customers into 
showrooms and revive slumping sales 
there were also declines in childrens clothing cosmetics 
magazines and tires prices rose for jewelry and electronic 
equipment 
the overall april increase left the producer price index for 
finished goods at 1130 meaning that a hypothetical selection of 
goods costing 100 in 1982 would have cost 113 last month up from 
11220 in march 
measures of inflation earlier in the production process also 
showed moderation intermediate goods rose 04 percent in april 
following a 07 percent jump in march crude goods rose 06 percent 
following a 23 percent gain 
an example of the three processing levels would be wholesale 
bread at the finished level flour at the intermediate and wheat at 
the crude 
economist robert g dederick of northern trust co in chicago 
said fridays producer price figures reinforce analysts 
expectations that federal reserve policymakers will vote to hold 
interest rates steady when they meet in private next tuesday to set 
monetary policy through june 
one thing you can be sure of he said for the first time 
in a long time theyre not going to be asking themselves whether 
they should be tightening i think the basic thing the fed will do 
is say all right we seem to be making progress 
in a separate report friday the commerce department said 
business inventories in march rose 03 percent while sales were 
flat confirming earlier government statistics showing economic 
growth slowing

mcdonalds corp announced plans friday 
to sell 100 million of a new issue of preferred stock to its 
employee stock ownership plan to increase employee holdings 
this transaction is a continuation of a longheld strategy and 
tradition established by our founder the late ray kroc of 
encouraging employee share ownership said fred l turner 
chairman of the fastfood giant 
the esop can borrow longterm funds and purchase stock at 
current prices to help our employees own more stock in the 
company he said it will not increase the companys total 
employeebenefit costs 
the new issue is convertible into less than 1 percent of 
outstanding common shares mcdonalds said the preferreds 
dividend and coversion ratio will be determined at the time of sale 
based on market conditions and each share will have one vote 
selling stock into an employee ownership plan has become popular 
among corporations because it cuts the companys tax bill while 
erecting a new takeover defense employees who own stock are 
considered more inclined to side with the company in a takeover 
battle choosing longterm gains over a shortterm windfall 
such concerns were not at issue in this case said mcdonalds 
spokesman chuck ebeling 
i dont think that has anything to do with it ebeling said 
the sale only represents 1 percent of outstanding common 
shares im told thats not significant enough to thwart a 
takeover attempt he said 
the companys esop is distinctive for its breadth of coverage 
our restaurant managers and fulltime restaurant crew all 
participate turner said 
this transaction will help to achieve our longterm goal of 
increasing stock ownership among the largest number of employees 
the esop intends to borrow the money needed to purchase the 
stock under a 300 million shelf registration filed friday with the 
securities and exchange commission the company said 
mcdonalds says it is the worlds largest foodservice 
organization serving 22 million people each day in more than 
10500 restaurants in 50 countries threequarters of its 
restaurant businesses are locally owned and operated by independent 
entrepreneurs

federal regulators said friday they will draft 
new rules designed to protect savings institutions from hostile 
takeovers after they convert from the mutual form of ownership to 
stock ownership 
the federal home loan bank board said it has directed its staff 
to rewrite the agencys rules to make the hostile intent of an sampl 
stock buyer one of the grounds for denial of an application for 
three years after an institution converts from mutal to stock 
ownership the bank board normally has authority to decide who may 
own a thrift institution 
the move comes after the board denied investor groups permission 
to acquire more than 10 percent of the stock of two institutions 
gateway federal savings and loan association of cincinnati and 
home unity savings and loan association of lafayette hill pa the 
institutions said the purchase efforts were unsolicited 
the board said hostile takeovers divert managerial resources 
and would discourage sampls from converting from mutual to stock 
ownership

almost like generals shoring up the front lines 
state legislatures are sending in fresh ammunition to aid 
corporations battling hostile takeovers new laws aimed at 
hindering unwanted assaults 
aided by recent key court rulings in favoring such legislation 
the states increasingly have enacted new or toughened existing 
antitakeover laws to protect companies facing real or potential 
hostile buyouts 
each new wave is getting tougher frederick lipman a 
partner with the law firm blank rome comisky amp mccauley in 
philadelphia said of the statutes 
that toughness has grown out of anger lipman said takeovers 
have cost the states thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in 
revenue in cases where new owners closed plants and laid off 
workers 
some of the most aggressive laws have emerged in states where 
labor carries a lot of political clout such as pennsylvania and 
ohio laws in these states generally allow directors to consider 
the welfare of employees and the community when the boards decide 
whether to accept or reject a takeover bid 
the ohio statute is broadest allowing directors to also 
consider a companys suppliers creditors and customers the local 
and national economy and social concerns 
what youre basically saying is you dont have to look to the 
shareholders interest alone lipman said 
states have had antitakeover laws for years but since april 
1987 aided by a landmark us supreme court ruling the 
legislatures have become more assertive in acting to protect local 
companies 
the nations highest court on april 21 1987 upheld an indiana 
antitakeover statute and the right of the states to enact laws to 
protect their corporations from hostile suitors 
analysts then correctly predicted there would be an explosion of 
state antitakeover statutes since the supreme court announced its 
decision more than half the states have passed new laws regulating 
takeovers 
but experts say growing public sentiment against takeovers has 
given the latest statutes their muscle 
linda quinn director of the division of corporate finance for 
the securities and exchange commission said in a recent summary of 
state antitakeover law developments that delawares new statute 
copied with some modifications by other states may be the most 
significant of the new laws 
the delaware statute enacted last year generally restricts the 
completion of a merger for three years if there is no board 
approval and if the hostile takeover is not approved by 85 percent 
of the shareholders if an acquirer cannot complete the merger it 
means company assets cannot be sold to help finance the deal 
many us corporations including more than half the fortune 500 
companies are incorporated in delaware more significantly 
polaroid corp proved earlier this year that the states law works 
polaroid used it as the basis for a successful defense against 
an unwanted bid from shamrock holdings inc the instantphotography 
company placed enough stock in friendly hands to virtually 
guarantee that shamrock would be unable to immediately complete a 
merger 
polaroids deft use of the law has given other states food for 
thought but analysts say antitakeover laws are not a panacea 
i dont think any of these laws are going to automatically 
prevent takeovers said attorney lipman theyre just one more 
weapon in the arsenal of management 
donald margotta a professor at northeastern university in 
boston said many of the tougher laws have been on the books for a 
year or more and generally have not deterred prospective acquirers 
they might require that people change some of their financing 
techniques or their strategies subsequent to taking control of a 
companies margotta said we might see companies running their 
targets as subsidiaries rather than doing a merger 
some of the new laws also include provisions that seek to 
curtail the growth of leveraged buyouts transactions accomplished 
primarily through the use of borrowed money 
such deals have come under attack by politicians and others 
following the record 2453 billion leveraged buyout of rjr nabisco 
inc on the grounds that such heavy debt loads are bad for 
businesses and the economy 
one of the new statutes part of new yorks business corporation 
law restricts an acquirers ability to use of a target companys 
tax losses it also limits in highlyleveraged transactions the 
acquirers ability to deduct the resulting interest expenses the 
law covers state taxes only but is an idea that congress is 
contemplating for the federal tax code 
evan weiss counsel to new york governor mario cuomo said 
officials are concerned about the impact that heavy borrowing may 
have on a companys business they claim it discourages longterm 
research and development spending and job expansion 
weiss said that even if a company is not under direct attack 
everybodys leveraging themselves to death to make themselves 
unattractive to raiders 
margotta said laws like the new york statute make it more 
difficult to do a typical highlyleveraged deal 
however some of the strengthened laws are themselves vulnerable 
to attack 
bank of new york co successfully challenged new york laws 
shareholder rights or poison pill statute last year in its 
hostile attempt to acquire irving trust co which it eventually 
won 
the new york legislature has since approved a replacement for 
the law 
delawares takeover statute was upheld by a us district court 
in december which could make the law even more attractive to 
other states but laws like the ohio and pennsylvania statutes that 
empower directors to consider nonshareholder interests have not 
yet been tested in court

demand for precious metals evaporated 
on other markets pork bellies rose grains and soybeans were 
mixed and energy futures were mixed

the spot silver price was the lowest since march 20 1987 when 
spot silver settled at 552 an ounce 
fridays labor department report of a moderate 04 percent rise 
in wholesale prices last month delivered the days first blow to 
the precious metals which tend to rise and fall with inflation 
fears 
later in the day the dollar posted strong gains against other 
major currencies which further weakened investment interest in 
precious metals 
analysts said recent economic indicators have not clearly 
indicated an inflationary trend and the speculation prompted by 
reports of sharply rising prices earlier this year has abated 
to spark strong demand for precious metals you need to have 
the consumers and the specultors and the commercials completely 
convinced that we are on a strong trend toward inflation said 
jack barbanel director of futures trading for gruntal amp co in new 
york 
analysts said that if silver fails to find support at 550 an 
ounce it probably will continue to slide perhaps as low as 525 
before buying interest surfaces 
were in a negative trend and we cant shake it off said 
stephen platt an analyst with dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
frozen pork belly futures prices leaped for the fourth session

wheat futures ended lower on the chicago board of trade while 
the corn and soybean markets finished with higher prices for 
oldcrop deliveries and losses in the newcrop contracts 
the drop in wheat prices reflected the arrival of badly needed 
rain in the parched winter wheat fields of the southern plains 
the usda lowered to 135 million bushels from 145 million bushels 
its projection for the aug 31 us soybean stockpile which 
supported prices for beans from last years crop

investors also apparently decided the report meant inflationary 
pressures were not building as suggested by last weeks 
unemployment report the april jobless report showed more people 
were out of work but also that hourly earnings climbed 
substantially during the month 
the fear until now was not that the economy would overheat but 
that inflation would rise rapidly and keep the fed from making 
moves to ease credit said michael metz technical analyst for 
oppenheimer amp co now it looks like that has changed inflation 
is under control 
prices took off at the opening bell and many players who had 
remained out of the market in anticipation of the wholesale price

have gone too far too fast 
were still going to have some uncomfortably high numbers

was great today it lifted everyones spirits but investors should 
be very careful because the market has overstated the case so on a 
shortterm basis we could give some ground

accelerating said william v sullivan director of money market 
research for dean witter reynolds inc it also suggested for the 
first time in well over a year that the fed may be in a position to 
ease credit policy 
the indication of an economic slowdown buttressed a government 
report thursday that showed retail sales up 04 percent last month 
well under the 13 percent many economists had expected 
sullivan said an economic slowdown along with lower prices could 
lead the federal reserve to relax its monetary policy encouraging 
lower interest rates and boosting the value of bonds

by oil prices rising said robert brusca chief economist with 
nikko securities international inc

regulators on friday authorized three 
exchanges to sell a new type of security that allows investors to 
bet on the direction of the stock market as a whole rather than 
purchasing individual stocks 
two of the exchanges the american stock exchange and the 
philadelphia stock exchange immediately began trading the 
instruments known as stock baskets amex is calling its product an 
equity index participation and philadelphia has named its a cash 
index participation 
the instruments are priced to reflect increases and declines in 
broad market indexes such as the standard amp poors 500stock index 
in march the sec had approved the products including the 
chicago board options exchanges value index participation but two 
large future exchanges asked the sec to delay the authorization 
while they sought to block trading with lawsuits in a federal 
appeals court in chicago 
the sec on friday denied that request saying the chicago 
mercantile exchange and chicago board of trade had failed to 
demonstrate they had a good chance of winning their suits or they 
would be irreparably harmed if trading went forward 
the futures exchanges which likely would lose business to the 
stock baskets contend that the instruments are a thinly disguised 
stock index future and must be approved by the commodity futures 
trading commission not the sec stock index futures also allow 
investors an opportunity to bet on the overall direction of the 
stock market 
all of the index participation products are based on the current 
value of various indexes of stocks investors receive quarterly 
cash payments equal to a proportionate share of any regular cash 
dividend declared on the component stocks of the underlying index 
in the first day of trading the amex recorded sales of 43 
million participations based on the sampp 500 representing volume of 
about 135 million spokeswoman marilyn imwalle said 
in philadelphia volume amounted to 17 million in 
participations based on the sampp 500 and 12000 in participations 
based on the exchanges blue chip index which tracks the dow jones 
industrial average spokesman paul adair said 
while the american and philadelphia exchanges began trading 
immediately the chicago board options exchange is holding off 
because of uncertainty created by the lawsuits cboe spokesman 
edward dunn said 
late friday the futures exchanges asked the chicago appeals 
court to block trading and the court gave the philadelphia and 
american exchanges until tuesday to reply

christian brothers winery is denying 
industry rumors that the venerable churchowned napa valley 
operations might be sold following a flood of news inquiries 
ron batori spokesman for the 107yearold winemaking 
institution said friday that winery president richard maher has 
been denying the rumors of a possible sale but batori conceded 
there are definitely things going on 
our position is that we are going to address that issue 
sooner rather than later he said 
christian brothers which is owned by the catholic church is 
napa valleys largest premium vineyard landowner including some of 
most fabled country in the nations top wineproducing region 
the rumors are that christian brothers might be sold to a 
beverage conglomerate such as heublein which owns beaulieu 
vineyard or hiram walker whose holdings include clos du bois 
industry sources were skeptical that the church would consider 
selling the operation while it was one of its most dynamic periods 
ever engaging in multiple ventures dramatically improving wines 
and selling products in the united states and 40 other countries 
the winery believed the largest churchowned operation of its 
kind in the world has been steadily buying land and is largest 
owner or controller of premium vineyard land in napa valley with 
about 1250 acres 
recent estimates indicating that a top grapeproducing napa 
valley acre is worth 50000 would make christian brothers 
vineyard land alone worth at least 60 million the company also 
has liquid and property assets over a large pasrt of the state 
the christian brothers teaching order was founded in france in 
the 17th century the worldwide order supports schools and colleges 
in some 80 countries 
a few years ago winery business was slumping from a number of 
elements including a a philosophy against vintage dating when it 
was reconized that this as well as market forces required change 
the brands started swinging up the catalyst for change was the 
loss of brandy market share to gallos eampj brand 
christian brothers boasts one of largest lineups of brands in 
the us wine industry including generic burgundy claret 
chablis rhine and sauterne and a full line of premium varietals 
including montage a napa valleyfrench blend plus dessert 
wines and champagne 
the company also makes sacramental wine

the government agency that insures millions of 
workers pensions cant force ltv corp to take back several plans 
it dumped when it filed for bankruptcy law protection a federal 
appeals court said friday 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals upheld a lower court 
ruling that the federal pension benefit guaranty corp was 
arbitrary and capricious in ordering ltv to take back more than 
2 billion in pension fund obligations 
the appeals court which sits in manhattan agreed with us 
district judge robert sweet that the pbgcs grounds for restoring 
the pension plans to ltv were not supported by the administrative 
record and the agencys decision should be reversed 
the appeals court sent the matter back to the pbgc for further 
consideration 
the pbgc is studying the opinion said judith bekelman a 
spokeswoman for the agency in washington who said she could not 
comment further until agency lawyers completed their study of the 
ruling 
the pbgc is responsible for insuring pension benefits much like 
the federal deposit insurance corp insures bank deposits the 
agency had claimed that ltv taking unfair advantage of federal 
funds to cut costs and gain labor peace while it goes through us 
bankruptcy code chapter 11 reorganization 
the pbgc also has claimed it doesnt have enough money to cover 
all the other pension plans it has had to take over 
ltv is very pleased with the unanimous decision of the appeals 
court said charles palmer an ltv corporate spokesman 
until we can sort the thing out i dont think we can say much 
more palmer said although he added the pension litigation 
has been a major obstacle in the forward movement in the chapter 11 
proceeding 
dallasbased ltv a giant steel aerospace and energy concern 
filed for protection from its creditors in july 1986 and five 
months later stopped paying for three pension plans in its 
clevelandbased steelmaking subsidiary ltv steel co 
the pbgc took control of the plans for some 100000 current and 
retired employees in january 1987 making the agency ltvs largest 
creditor 
when the pbgc eliminated benefits not covered by its guarantees 
several thousand ltv pensioners had their benefits cut by as much 
as 400 a month 
that prompted the united steelworkers of america to sue in 
bankruptcy court for restoration of the lost benefits and threaten 
a crippling strike 
ltv and the steelworkers union reached a new labor contract in 
june 1987 that replaced most of the lost benefits but the pbgc 
balked at subsidizing the plans for ltv and last september shifted 
responsibility for the pension plans back to ltv 
ltv sued in bankruptcy court claiming the pbgc action violated 
federal bankruptcy law which bars legal action against companies 
in reorganization 
the pbgc had the case moved to the district court level before 
sweet claiming it was concerned that if ltv was able to get out of 
its pension plan obligations that would encourage other companies 
with underfunded pension plans to use the bankruptcy code to shed 
their obligations 
but sweet ruled last september that pbgcs conclusion to 
restore the plans to ltv was reached in an arbitrary and 
capricious manner
