a complaint by the national rifle association 
stopped the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms from banning the 
importation of 25 more models of semiautomatic weapons thursday a 
newspaper reported 
the washington post in its friday editions said the bureau was 
ordered to hold off by treasury department officials after the nra 
raised objections 
the newspaper said senior batf officials decided at a meeting 
thursday morning to announce the restrictions on the additional 
models later in the day according to an official familiar with the 
events but then they were instructed by the parent treasury 
department not to proceed according to the official 
james jay baker a senior nra official said the group learned on 
wednesday night that other weapons might be added to the list of 
five types of assault weapons which drug czar william j bennett 
temporarily banned on tuesday and contacted treasury officials who 
said there would not be any new restrictions the newspaper said 
the ban announced by bennett included the chinesemade ak47 and 
the israeli uzi and covered about 80 percent of total imports of 
semiautomatic weapons 
atf then sought to close the door on the semiautomatic weapons 
not covered by the initial ban fearing that these firearms would 
fill the void the post said in addition batf officials worried 
that manufacturers affected by the import ban would complain they 
were unfairly singled out

about 140000 chinese take their own lives every 
year most of them women and suicide has become a particularly 
serious problem among rural women a chinese sociologist says 
shan guangnai of the china academy of social sciences said 
suicide is the leading cause of abnormal deaths in china and 70 
percent of all victims are female the official china daily reported 
today 
it used to be a taboo in china to study suicide yet in recent 
years we are increasingly haunted by the rising problem the paper 
quoted her as saying 
a survey of 10 million people taken by the china preventive 
medical science institute found the suicide rate for urban women to 
be 102 per 100000 and for urban men 723 per 100000 
in rural areas the suicide rate was 2334 for women and 186 for 
men 
in the united states the suicide rate is about 12 per 100000 
shan said half the suicides among women are caused by family 
disputes and marital problems he noted factors such as the breakup 
of the traditional extended family and lengthy separations as rural 
people stream into cities looking for work 
rural women are still treated as dependents and men dominate in 
the family shan said adding that the psychological and emotional 
needs of women are largely ignored 
he said women also appear to have more difficulty adapting to 
rapid changes in chinas social values and moral standards brought 
about by industrialization and improving living standards 
rural women who migrate to the cities looking for work often find 
the sharp contrast is too much for them shan said those who 
return to their villages have difficulty adjusting again to rural 
poverty 
tens of thousands of chinese committed suicide as a result of 
persecution during the ultraleftist 196676 cultural revolution 
the more recent phenomenon of suicide linked to changing social 
conditions has only recently begun to be a subject for study 
in january 1988 the southern city of canton opened the nations 
first suicide prevention and treatment center 
in the first year it received about 140 phone calls 600 letters 
and dozens of visitors asking for help the china daily said 
beijing also opened a suicide prevention center last september

the practice of disposing of pigeons by 
burying them alive was suspended after an official of the humane 
society of the united states contacted the mayors office 
guy hodge of the societys washington headquarters said he 
offered to travel to lexington and provide a blueprint for urban 
pigeon control that would include alternatives to burying the birds 
alive in the county landfill hodge said tuesday that the society 
might challenge the practice of burying live birds 
i would say certainly it violates the spirit if not the 
letter of the anticruelty law protecting animals in kentucky 
hodge said 
hodge said he knew of no other place in the nation where pigeons 
were buried alive john hadidian an urban wildlife biologist with 
the national park service in washington also said hed never heard 
of such a practice elsewhere 
lexington mayor scotty baesler who was in a meeting wednesday 
afternoon issued a statement that the burials were suspended he 
said he was unaware of the practice until it was reported wednesday 
in the lexington heraldleader 
robert myers of the lexington humane society said he was not 
aware the birds were being buried alive 
of course we see problems with that he said 
the city had a yearround trapping program and caught about 125 
birds a week said gayle wilson an aide in the department of public 
works he said the pigeons congregate on public buildings and leave 
smelly droppings 
they were removed by city sanitation workers tied in burlap bags 
and taken to the landfill where the bags were buried 
wilson said the method combined reasonable humaneness and 
convenience the method was inexpensive but that was not the 
deciding factor he said 
hodge said there is no evidence that killing pigeons eliminates 
the problem in the long run 
instead the humane society advocates taking measures to limit 
roosting spots pigeonproofing buildings by placing sharp 
spikes on roosting areas frightening the birds with noisemakers and 
passing laws to limit the food supply from citizens restaurants and 
other sources 
wilson said it was expensive to pigeonproof buildings and that 
pigeons were smart birds that soon learned to ignore noisemakers and 
predator decoys the only solution is to kill the birds he said 
tuesday 
wilson said that despite the apparent success of a pigeon shoot 
sunday in downtown somerset in southeast kentucky lexingtons 
pigeon problem was not bad enough to warrant blocking off downtown 
and shooting the birds 
i think the problem would have to be much more serious before 
wed close the downtown and let hunters cut loose on them 
wilson said 
carroll estes community development director in somerset said 
500 to 600 birds about half the pigeon population there were 
killed in sundays shoot and he expected half that many to be 
killed in a shoot scheduled saturday 
hodge said he had been trying wednesday to contact somerset 
officials to offer them a similar plan for pigeon control but had 
been unsuccessful 
estes who said he planned no further shoots after saturday 
because of the media aggravating you to death said he 
considered the method more humane than live burial 
im not out here choking ours to death he said

a gay man who becomes infected with the aids 
virus stands a 5050 chance of going nearly 10 years without 
developing the disease suggests a study reported today 
the virus may incubate at least 98 years in half the gay men it 
infects some two years longer than other recent studies suggested 
according to the analysis of aids among gay men in san francisco 
if infected people are given azt or an aerosol form of the drug 
pentamidine to stave off development of aids the interval may run 
longer said researcher andrew moss 
he and colleague peter bacchetti of the university of california 
san francisco and san francisco general hospital present the work 
in todays issue of the british journal nature 
the study represents a new approach to estimating aids incubation 
time and its good work john kalbfleisch of the university of 
waterloo ontario canada said wednesday 
kalbfleisch a statistics professor who has done similar 
research said incubation estimates are uncertain because too little 
time has passed since the earliest aids infections to give a clearer 
picture 
for the new work researchers compared infection rates among san 
francisco gay men since 1978 to monthly totals of new cases of 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
the analysis estimated incubation times that would be consistent 
with the two sets of data it was not designed to determine the 
fraction of infected men who would eventually get aids moss said 
he said he believed incubation periods seen among people who were 
infected by transfusions will eventually approach the 98year 
figure 
the work suggests that the number of new aids cases among san 
francisco gay men will decline after this year moss said other 
studies suggest the number of new infections started to decline 
after 1982 he said 
several teams of researchers had previously estimated aids 
incubation times 
last year kalbfleisch and colleague jf lawless suggested that 
half of adults infected by tainted blood transfusions may still be 
free of aids 73 years after infection also last year researchers 
at the centers for disease control and the san francisco department 
of public health estimated an average incubation of 78 years among 
84 gay men 
a british economist suggested a 15year average incubation period 
in a 1987 analysis of blood transfusion data but his study has 
since been criticized by other scientists kalbfleisch and bacchetti 
said another transfusion study that year estimated an eightyear 
average 
a report by the institute of medicine estimated that 25 percent 
to 50 percent of infected people will develop aids in five to 10 
years 
aids has struck 87188 americans and killed 49976 since june 
1981 according to the most recent cdc figures sixtyone percent of 
cases have occurred in gay or bisexual males 
the aids virus is called human immunodeficiency virus or hiv it 
is spread most often through sexual contact needles or syringes 
shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products and from 
pregnant women to their offspring

studies of a protein that prevents the most 
common kind of muscular dystrophy should be aided by todays report 
of a way to isolate the substance from muscle tissue researchers 
say 
scientists do not yet know what the protein does in muscle 
tissue but its absence causes duchenne muscular dystrophy the most 
common and severe kind of dystrophy 
isolation of the protein from rabbit muscle is reported in 
todays issue of the british journal nature by kevin campbell and 
steven kahl at the university of iowa college of medicine in iowa 
city 
they said the isolation method should help research into the 
protein called dystrophin 
the new study found dystrophin was tightly bound to a second 
protein the results suggest the combination of the two proteins may 
be important for normal muscle structure or function the 
researchers said 
duchenne dystrophy is a genetic disorder that strikes boys almost 
exclusively appearing in about one in every 3500 male births in 
the united states it causes a progressive weakening and wasting of 
voluntary muscles 
most patients die in their early 20s

john g tower has fallen but the sky has not 
for all the forecasts of dire results if the senate blocked 
towers path to the pentagon business is proceeding as usual 
president bush said the case was closed and accepted democratic 
assurances of future cooperation 
that doesnt undo the resentment among some of towers more 
ardent republican allies in the senate and in some corners of the 
white house bush lieutenants claimed they had heard what sounded 
like assurances of support from a dozen senate democrats they ended 
up with only three democrats in the closetopartyline vote against 
tower 
nevertheless a week after the former texas senator was denied 
confirmation as secretary of defens the waters have closed 
there will be ripples and some of them could be wavesized the 
goodbehavior rules set in the debate over towers drinking habits 
and his lucrative defense consulting business are certain to be 
invoked as precedents whenever republicans spot a democratic target 
weve established what will be known as the tower standards 
said sen john warner rva 
that argument will be used by house republicans challenging the 
financial conduct of house speaker jim wright but it will be a 
debating point not a turning point in a wright controversy that 
was ordained long before the tower episode 
while president bush was unwavering in his support of tower he 
burned no bridges to congressional democrats he insisted that tower 
was the best man for the job and he spoke out repeatedly for his 
choice even after it was clear that the nomination was doomed but 
he didnt get nasty about it saying there was no point in 
escalating the fight 
thats over he said 24 hours after the tower defeat 
thats history and now we are going to go forward 
the 5347 vote against tower was a setback to bush in the sense 
that it always is a defeat when congress denies a president 
something he wants but this denial did not cost bush a program or 
a major campaign pledge or the support of voters 
indeed it could turn out that the senate did the president a 
favor by sending tower back to texas instead of to the pentagon it 
was a break bush could not make with a political ally who had been 
after the pentagon job since ronald reagan was elected president 
tower had not been a reagan man he had supported bush for the 
1980 nomination and the reagan white house went to some lengths to 
rule the senator out of the job he sought declaring that the new 
president would not be nominating any senate republican for any 
cabinet post 
after towers long wait bush displayed his own loyalty all the 
way to a losing vote when the standard somewhat safer course would 
have been to withdraw the nominee tower not only shunned 
withdrawal he offered conditions that had to be humiliating if 
only the senate would let him have the job 
tower promised to quit drinking taking the pledge on national 
television and when that didnt work he offered to become the 
firstever probationary cabinet member republicans proposed that he 
get the job for a sixmonth trial and then return for 
reconfirmation a gimmick that would have changed the system and 
could have haunted the presidency 
no deal so tower became the ninth cabinet nominee ever to be 
rejected the first who was a former senator 
bush said he had been fighting for the right of a president to 
appoint his own cabinet but he avoided language that would have 
raised the political stakes 
tower did not restrain himself battling for the job he said 
withdrawal would damage bush and rejection would be damning the 
presidents judgment he said his nomination had been turned into 
a vehicle for a major presidential defeat 
towers advocates on the senate floor said grave constitutional 
issues were at stake that the authority of the presidency was on 
the line that the senate will come to rue the rules it wrote in the 
tower decision 
but bush said all along that the outcome either way would not 
hurt on other issues 
sen sam nunn chairman of the armed services committee and the 
pivotal figure in the tower defeat agreed he told his georgia 
constituents that the tower rejection would not hurt bushs 
leadership 
in washington triumphs and setbacks are shortlived 
nunn said and thats particularly true of the president

the national weather service is promising 
better forecasts and fewer false alarms when it completes a 
reorganization program officials say will close more than 100 local 
offices 
a giant supercomputer an array of new hightech radar and 
automated data collection systems will allow the agency to operate 
with 800 fewer workers and 115 local offices rather than the 
approximately 250 now open says nws director elbert w friday 
friday said the agency hopes to complete the modernization 
program by 1995 but promised that no local office will be closed 
until officials are convinced they can do so without hurting local 
forecast and warning services 
staff cuts will be handled through normal attrition friday said 
with no current workers expected to lose their jobs the program is 
expected to reduce the overall staff from 4700 people to about 
3900 when it is completed 
despite the nws assurances on wednesday the plan is likely to 
provoke criticism from some members of congress reports earlier 
this month that some nws offices might be closed led to quick 
complaints from senators and representatives anxious to preserve 
jobs and facilities in their home states 
friday said a list of the 115 communities expected to retain 
offices would be made public however nws spokesmen later told 
reporters that the commerce department had nixed that plan and the 
list would not be released 
friday said the improved technology some of which is being 
tested in norman okla is expected to improve forecasting of 
severe storms from 60 percent accuracy to 80 percent that should 
reduce false alarms an equal amount he said 
he said the automated data collection and processing system will 
first be installed in kansas oklahoma nebraska and colorado and 
will be expanded to the remainder of the country once it is proven 
effective 
major components of the new system will be 
the next generation weather radar which will provide more 
detailed analysis of storms than current radar which was installed 
in the 1960s the new radar can detect wind direction improving the 
ability to see tornadoes before they touch the ground friday said 
the automated surface observing system which will replace many 
current weather service offices with computerized stations that 
continually measure temperature humidity rainfall cloud height 
wind and visibility these stations will send data now collected by 
people to central offices for use in writing forecasts 
a supercomputer will be installed at the national meteorological 
center in camp springs md to provide detailed forecasts twice a 
day to weather service offices for use in preparing local forecasts 
the advance weather interactive processing system an upgraded 
computer forecasting system to be installed in all 115 local offices 
the national weather service employees organization however was 
critical of the plan saying the new equipment hasnt been proven 
effective 
while nws officials declined to provide either a list of weather 
offices to be closed or those to be kept open an unofficial map was 
obtained indicating 113 sites in the 48 contiguous states expected 
to retain weather forecasting offices some locations are 
approximate with final decisions yet to be made

the energy department is urging aviation 
authorities to restrict flights over its military nuclear reactors 
to make them more secure against potential terrorist attack 
weve got a lot to do in that area energy secretary james d 
watkins told a house budget subcommittee wednesday its going to 
be some time before we get this completely closed 
the issue was raised by sen jim exon dneb during a hearing 
in which watkins pledged to give top priority to modernizing and 
cleaning up the departments nuclear weapons complex which includes 
16 major facilities in 12 states 
exon said he was stunned to read a recent report that there are 
no effective restrictions on airplane flights over the savannah 
river plant near aiken sc whose reactors are the nations only 
source of a gas used in nuclear warheads those reactors currently 
are not operating because of safety problems 
if there is one place where we have fallen down on what is a 
b c in security it is in this area exon said 
savannah river also includes an energy department research 
laboratory a plant that makes naval reactor fuel material two 
chemical separation plants and a facility that produces weapongrade 
plutonium 
the only nuclear weapons plant that now has prohibited airspace 
is the pantex plant near amarillo texas which is the final weapons 
assembly point 
the charlotte observer reported in last sundays editions that 
classified security reports obtained by the newspaper in a freedom 
of information act request showed savannah river officials had 
repeatedly urged the federal aviation administration to ban 
lowaltitude flights over the 300squaremile facility 
the faa said the energy department had failed to justify the need 
for the restrictions which the aviation agency views as excessive 
watkins said he was personally involved in trying to establish 
the air restrictions not only at savannah river but also at other 
sensitive weapons plants 
weve got to take a look all around he said to find ways of 
better protecting the weapons complex from possible air attacks by 
terrorists or damage from a crash 
i believe with the new secretary of transportation and with my 
personal friend coming into the faa i dont see any problem getting 
it reestablished watkins said 
although he was not more specific watkins a retired admiral 
apparently was referring to recent reports that adm james d busey 
iv commander of naval forces in europe since march 1987 would be 
named faa administrator 
the faa said wednesday the bush administration had not yet 
nominated anyone for the job 
the observer report said that last september the energy 
department dropped its 1983 request to prohibit flights below 14000 
feet for savannah river and eight other weapons sites the agency 
settled for a 2000foot minimum limit at savannah river that 
restriction however is voluntary and not enforceable the report 
said

amid israeli complaints secretary of state 
james a baker iii is playing down his suggestion that direct talks 
between israel and the palestine liberation organization may be 
needed if alternate peace efforts fail 
baker told the senate appropriations subcommittee on foreign 
operations wednesday that an israeliplo dialogue was difficult to 
foresee but should not categorically be ruled out 
this represented a shift in tone from tuesday when he told a 
house subcommittee that if talks between israel and nonplo 
palestinians do not prosper i suppose we would then have to see 
negotiations between israelis and representatives of the plo 
bakers remark triggered a telephone call from israeli foreign 
minister moshe arens who told the secretary that the statement was 
damaging to the prospects for a dialogue between israel and 
nonplo palestinians arens here for official talks disclosed the 
phone call to israeli reporters 
at wednesdays hearing sen arlen specter rpa said bakers 
statement was an open invitation for the plo to engage in 
terrorist activities against palestinians who choose to bargain with 
israel 
baker replied that he only meant to say in his earlier remarks 
that an israeliplo dialogue should not be categorically 
absolutely totally and completely ruled out under any and all 
circumstances because it might help the peace process 
the comment did not repudiate what he had said tuesday but there 
was a clear change in emphasis 
israel has steadfastly refused to talk to the plo and says the 
dialogue the united states opened with the plo last december has 
strengthened the groups hand 
arens accused the plo on tuesday of committing the worst 
atrocities weve ever seen since world war ii 
in his remarks wednesday baker seemed to hold out little hope 
that an international conference on the middle east advocated by 
many arab states could make a significant contribution to peace 
what is needed instead baker said are mutually reciprocal and 
reinforcing steps by both israel and the palestinians to build 
confidence 
both sides have to take steps he said 
the mood at the hearing was generally friendly but there were 
some hints that president bush may encounter some resistance 
especially on central american policy 
subcommittee chairman patrick leahy dvt said the only aid 
package he could support for the nicaraguan contra rebels would be 
one leading to their resettlement in nicaragua or elsewhere from the 
base camps where they now are housed in honduras 
baker said he believes the contras should remain intact at least 
until national elections are held in nicaragua next february he 
implied that the rebels could then be reintegrated into nicaragua if 
the elections are fair 
the administration is expected to seek a humanitarian aid package 
for the contras in the 40 million to 50 million range in the next 
few days 
on el salvador leahy said that if the rightist arena party wins 
presidential elections there on sunday future us aid to that 
country should carry strict conditions because of the ties he said 
arena has with death squad activities 
baker replied that it would be a mistake to exaggerate the size 
of the death squad problem contending that politically motivated 
murders averaged 800 per month in 1981 and 1982 compared with 280 
per year at present 
he added however that the administration is aware of continuing 
human rights problems in el salvador recalling that vice president 
dan quayle raised that issue with salvadoran officials during a 
visit there six weeks ago

the sponsor of legislation that would establish 
a uniform closing time for polls in 48 of the 50 states says he 
expects full house approval of the bill as early as next month 
on wednesday the house administration committee approved the 
measure on a voice vote 
rep al swift sponsor of the bill said he expects the house to 
approve the measure in early april but house speaker jim wright has 
indicated passage could come before the easter recess which begins 
march 24 
election officials in the west have charged that the early 
projection of the winner in the presidential race discourages people 
from voting in their states and the drop in turnout had affected the 
outcomes of close local races 
swift dwash has said previously that studies have shown voter 
turnout can drop by as much as 2 percent in states where the polls 
are still open but the winner in a presidential contest is known 
with passage of this legislation we will be one step closer to 
preserving the integrity of election day not only in the west but 
across the country said swift 
swifts bill was similar to ones approved by the house twice 
before but both times the senate failed to act a different version 
of a uniform poll closing bill is before the senate rules committee 
under swifts bill polls would close simultaneously across the 
country at 9 pm est on election day in the pacific time zone 
daylightsaving time would be extended for a maximum of two weeks in 
presidential election years the extension would allow polls in that 
time zone to close at 7 pm pdt 
alaska and hawaii are exempt from the legislation but could 
change their poll closing times if desired 
swift said the need for a uniform closing time became apparent 
with the 1980 election when television networks projected the 
results based on exit polling hours before the polls on the west 
coast closed 
the networks have since agreed not to project election results in 
a state where the polls havent closed but in 1988 the problem was 
different as president bush rolled up a large electoral college 
majority before western polls closed 
swift said his uniform poll closing bill will ensure that 
voters in all regions of the country will be able to cast their 
ballots without being told who won the election 
the networks held to their part of the bargain last november 
now it is up to the house and senate to send this legislation to the 
president 
while a version of a poll closing bill cleared the senate rules 
commitee late last year congress adjourned before the the full 
senate had an opportunity to act 
sen brock adams dwash has introduced legislation that avoids 
a change in daylightsaving time and simply calls for the polls to 
close at 7 pm pacific time 8 pm mountain time 9 pm central 
time and 10 pm eastern time 
barbara smith an adams spokeswoman said the chairman of the 
rules committee sen wendell ford dky has indicated he expects 
adams bill to clear the panel in early april

thousands of people some chanting 
russians go home marched in twilight across the danube river to 
demand hungarys full independence and celebrate its first small 
steps toward democracy 
an estimated 100000 people took to the streets of the capital on 
wednesday to mark hungarys 1848 revolt against austrian rule an 
anniversary that has become a symbol for reformers demanding greater 
freedoms 
unlike in previous years when authorities cracked down on 
celebrations the anniversary this year was declared a public 
holiday and both government and opposition rallies took place 
peacefully across the nation 
in budapest thousands of people sporting national emblems 
marched listened to poetry and folk songs and chanted slogans 
during rallies and other events held throughout the day 
crowds applauded calls for an independent hungary the withdrawal 
of soviet troops free elections and a multiparty system and 
expressed solidarity with jailed activists in neighboring east bloc 
countries 
a fivehour march through the capital to symbolic sites of the 
1848 revolution which austria crushed in 1849 with the help of 
russian troops was followed in the evening by a candlelight 
procession across a danube bridge and up a steep road to the castle 
hill 
police made no move all day to interfere with the marchers 
prodemocracy activist sandor szilagyi one of the organizers of 
wednesdays mass march through the capital said this was a sign the 
communist party was sincere about taking steps toward democracy 
in past years large numbers of police escorted demonstrators at 
unofficial gatherings or forcibly dispersed them and detained 
protest leaders in 1986 the state department protested violent a 
police crackdown on a march 15 rally 
in a further sign of hungarys recent reforms and greater 
independence from moscow no sovietstyle red flags hung anywhere in 
the capital for the first time on any national holiday in three 
decades 
the day amounted to one of the biggest outpourings of nationalist 
pride since another unsuccessful hungarian revolt the antisoviet 
uprising of 1956 was crushed by russian tanks 
miklos tamasgaspar a leader of the opposition federation of 
free democrats told the crowd gathered before the candlelight march 
that march 15 was not only a celebration of 1848 but also of 1956 
the aim is the same he said constitutional democracy and 
national independence 
wednesday night a crowd estimated by western reporters and 
independent activists to be about 80000 to 100000 marched across 
the river to the castle with some chanting russians go home 
themes of democracy and independence marked events throughout the 
day as hungarians celebrated the newly recognized holiday and 
recent reforms endorsed by parliament that could usher in a bona 
fide multiparty system 
denes csengey a popular leader of one of the largest independent 
groups the hungarian democratic forum told a cheering crowd that 
march 15 should not be the only day of freedom 
he spoke in front of the television headquarters where children 
stood underneath a banner which read free hungarian television 
referring to a decision by independent groups not to accept an 
invitation by communist leaders to celebrate jointly csengey said 
the separate celebrations did not mean we dont wish to work 
toward national unity

scientists missed by 150 years in dating the 
oldest known reliable record of a total solar eclipse a clay tablet 
that also reflects fear among the ancient observers researchers 
said today 
scientists had concluded about 20 years ago that the eclipse 
recorded on a clay tablet found in syria occurred on may 3 1375 
bc 
but in todays issue of the british journal nature two dutch 
scientists report their analysis shows the eclipse really happened 
about 150 years later on march 5 1223 bc 
the tablet was found in 1948 in the ruins of ugarit an ancient 
city near syrias mediterranean coast one side appears to tell of a 
solar eclipse and the reverse side reads two livers were 
examined danger 
apparently the anxiety caused by the eclipse of the sun and the 
sudden appearance of mars had to be resolved by an explanation 
through liver divination wrote the researchers from the 
university of amsterdam and leiden university 
they concluded that the earlier text analysis of the tablet 
misidentified the time of year in which the eclipse occurred the 
new study indicated the eclipse really happened in late february or 
early march 
in addition the text apparently indicates that mars was visible 
at the time of the eclipse the dutch researchers said 
they compared those criteria and the likely age range for the 
tablet to a list of possible total solar eclipses visible from 
ugarit only the event in 1223 bc fills the bill the researchers 
said 
in an accompanying editorial christopher bf walker of the 
british museum in london cautioned that their conclusion can best 
be regarded as a plausible hypothesis 
the translation of the tablets text is not certain and the 
study assumes that citizens of ugarit followed an egyptianstyle 
calendar for which no supporting evidence is available he said 
even if the tablet is 150 years younger than previously believed 
it would remain the oldest known reliable record of a total solar 
eclipse edwin krupp director of the griffith observatory in los 
angeles said in a telephone interview 
the nextoldest record was made in china in the eighth century 
bc said krupp a researcher in ancient astronomy

lady

the role for which she won the first of her four tony awards

as his only nonfamily nonofficial guest on 
becoming secretary of veterans affairs edward j derwinski chose 
world war ii cartoonist bill mauldin who says the new department 
sounds like the same old bureaucracy under a different name 
mauldin winner of the pulitzer prize created the bedraggled 
dogfaces willie and joe for the soldiers newspaper stars and 
stripes 
willie and joe told the truth of the war world war ii and the 
fatigue sadness anxiety and humor of the period derwinski said 
in his remarks on the white house south lawn with mauldin close to 
him on the podium 
mauldin 67 was a constituent when derwinski represented the 
south side of chicago during 12 terms in congress 
during an interview before wednesdays ceremony mauldin said he 
knew derwinski only slightly and did not know whose idea it was to 
make him a prominent part of the days events 
mauldin carries a few more pounds and gray hairs than he did in 
slogging his way up the italian peninsula in 19431944 where he 
collected a minor shoulder wound from a german mortar round that 
inspired one of his best panels soldier standing to medic 
seated at a table with boxes of medals before him just gimme the 
aspirin i already got a purple heart 
he told two reporters one from stars and stripes i cant help 
thinking derwinski knows my attitude as an opponent of the large 
mainline veterans groups and of what he saw as their grasping 
attitude 
we were against the special philosophy if youre a veteran 
youre a special case he said just by virtue of being a 
veteran i dont think that entitles a guy to a gravytrain ride for 
the rest of his life 
mauldin belonged to the tiny american veterans committee serving 
two terms as chairman and has not used any veterans benefits 
we backed the gi bill but our slogan was citizens first 
veterans second he said i havent paid dues for years but 
they still send me mail 
there are millions of guys for whom the military experience was 
the one great experience of their lives i dont blame them for 
wanting to sit around on a saturday night with their friends and 
tell lies about their experience 
mauldin said he had not paid close attention to veterans affairs 
recently so his opinions had to be tentative 
agent orange veterans are being forced to try to prove 
illnesses are connected to exposure to that defoliant but the 
burden of proof ought to be on the government those kids ought to 
have it made up to them im very much in favor of a liberal hand 
in compensation 
a cabinet department replacing the old veterans administration 
it sounds like the same bureaucracy under a different name 
maybe it will be entirely different 
he was not at all tentative on universal service 
i think its great the idea of putting two or three years of a 
young mans or womans life into public service he said 
if youre not inclined to the military then ccctype work 
the ccc was the civilian conservation corps a depressionera 
agency tha provided jobs clothes and food for young men in camps 
working on conservation projects 
i think everyone owes his country a few years out of his life 
just a short period two years maybe three 
the point of this he said is to make better citizens out of 
them bond them to their country 
though many proponents of universal service have said the ending 
of the draft in 1973 ended valuable lessons in democracy through the 
militarys mixing of classes races and viewpoints mauldin said he 
thought the sociology is obviously a side benefit 
mauldin himself enlisted in the new mexico national guard in 
1940 more than a year before the entry of the united states into 
world war ii because i had some friends in the unit i wanted to 
be with i wanted to get into something not out of something 
which started his cartoonist juices flowing i dont want to 
pick on danny boy he said with a grin recalling cartoons of last 
falls campaign lambasting the vietamera plunge into the indiana 
national guard of vice president dan quayle

the roman catholic church where 
parishioners rebelled over the removal of a polish priest has 
reopened but church authorities revealed that the priest has been 
suspended by his superiors 
police have guarded st michael the archangel church since it was 
closed feb 18 by bishop edward egan after a weeklong sitin by 
about 200 dissidents upset over the sudden unexplained ouster of 
the rev roman palaszewski 
there were relatively few worshipers wednesday at four early 
morning masses two celebrated in english and two in polish said 
the rev james smyka associate pastor 
it was very very emotional smyka said the 630 mass i 
think i cried through half of it it was just so good to be back in 
the church i mean thats what our business is as priests 
some parishioners said they were overjoyed by the churchs 
reopening some said they heard about it by wordofmouth or by 
making daily drives by the church since the announcement that it 
would reopen 
monsignor nicholas grieco a spokesman for egan said wednesday 
that palaszewski was suspended indefinitely for defying orders from 
his franciscan superiors in krakow poland to return to poland last 
month 
hes still ordained but he cannot function as a priest because 
he didnt obey his superior who commanded him under obedience to 
return to poland grieco said he would not be able to say mass 
or administer the sacraments 
palaszewski who spent three years at the church under an 
agreement between his superiors in poland and franciscan officials 
in baltimore has been in seclusion in the bridgeport area since his 
removal in december 
about 50 worshipers attended a lenten prayer service wednesday 
evening they entered the church under the watchful eye of a police 
officer sitting in a van parked discreetly across the street 
four or five dissidents watched quietly from across the street 
wednesday evening as worshipers entered the church 
they then gathered at a polish club a block from the church to 
plan a demonstration outside the church this weekend on palm sunday 
the start of the holiest week in the church year 
they didnt heal our wounds everything is the same said 
genevieve kozlowski a parishioner for 25 years and one of the 
protest leaders 
she was unaware of wednesdays opening but said she and many 
other protesters plan to boycott services because they dont believe 
their complaints have been addressed kozlowski said 
the dissidents are demanding palaszewskis return to the parish 
and the removal of the churchs pastor the rev john bambol who 
they claim engineered palaszewskis removal because of his 
popularity among recent immigrants 
they also question bambols commitment to maintaining the 
churchs polis traditions 
bambols supporters have said palaszewski paid scant attention to 
parishioners who were not recent immigrants 
a weeklong sitin by about 200 dissidents who occupied the church 
in shifts ended early feb 18 when church authorities summoned 
police to expel them two who refused to leave voluntarily were 
charged with trespassing 
egan suspended masses indefinitely the same day 
bambol said after the prayer service that the dissidents are 
welcome to return as long as they abide by the rules of the 
church he said he was very joyful very happy that the church 
had reopened 
after all we were all suffering for so long unjustifiably 
we are happy to be back in harness so to speak he said this 
is a period of reconciliation

a us gunmaker is suspending sales of a 
semiautomatic assaultstyle rifle following imposition of an import 
ban on similar foreignmade firearms frequently used by drug dealers 
we want to conform to the spirit of the law although we werent 
specifically mentioned in the letter of the law colt industries 
inc spokesman mike dunn said wednesday after announcing the 
voluntary suspension of sales of the companys ar15 a semiautomatic 
version of the militarys m16 
the action came one day after the bush administration announced a 
ban on imports of several foreignmade semiautomatic weapons that 
police say have contributed to a nationwide wave of drugrelated 
killings calls for controls also increased after an assault rifle 
was used in the california schoolyard attack that killed five 
children earlier this year 
administration officials said the move may just be temporary but 
that with import applications skyrocketing they wanted to head off 
an imminent surge of the deadly firearms entering the country 
colts voluntary move to halt ar15 sales was lauded by william j 
bennett the nations drug control director as an act of civic 
responsibility 
dick pedersen of the treasury departments bureau of alcohol 
tobacco and firearms added its amazing how this thing is just 
taking off 
bennett on tuesday announced the suspension of pending import 
permits for more than 110000 semiautomatic rifles until the atf can 
review if their intended use fits the requirement that they be sport 
weapons 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater asked wednesday if the 
president would expand the review to domestic models said there 
are no plans of that kind anticipated 
but dunn said colt will permanently halt sales of the ar15 to 
civilians if it is determined by the government review that 
semiautomatic rifles are not appropriate for the commercial 
market he would not reveal how many of the rifles colt makes 
gregg risch of handgun control one of the countrys leading gun 
control advocates called the move by colt unprecedented 
but when asked about the possible impact on crime risch said 
zero 
there are a couple of million of them already out on the 
streets gun stores already have large stocks of ones already 
imported and domestically made ones and yesterdays action doesnt 
do anything to stop them from selling those risch said 
gwynne peirson retired professor of criminology at howard 
university and a police officer for 23 years in oakland calif 
said the ban on imports will have no immediate impact but 
ultimately could if it is made permanent 
it will have to trickle down and we may not even see the impact 
next year he said the only thing the ban will do in the short 
run is to increase the price of the available weapons 
the national rifle association said halting imports will have 
little impact on crime it said the government is targeting 
lawabiding citizens and their guns not criminals who will ignore 
guncontrol laws anyway 
if we leave this guy out on the street he operates outside of 
all of our laws and he sneers at society and hes going to be a 
major problem said wayne lapierre executive director of the nra 
institute for legislative action 
the colt ar15 is the most similar usmade weapon to those 
covered by the import ban such as semiautomatic versions of ak47s 
and uzi carbines pedersen said 
the suspension on imports does not affect thousands of other 
semiautomatic rifles awaiting import permits he said the ones 
that dont look like automatic weapons are still coming in he 
said 
the nra maintains that only cosmetic differences exist between 
the different weapons 
pedersen agreed with the nra that it is extremely difficult to 
convert such weapons into fully automatic guns as members of 
congress and gun control advocates elsewhere have contended 
according to estimates by the nra and gun control activists 
there are 60 million to 70 million firearms in private hands in the 
united states including 20 million to 30 million semiautomatic 
weapons ranging from pistols to the assaultstyle rifles 
but it is unclear exactly how many semiautomatic rifles are 
produced in the united states as manufacturers are not required to 
report their output with such detail pedersen said 
in 1987 the united states produced a total of 176 million 
handguns and 101 million rifles including regular bolt and pump 
action armaments as well as semiautomatics pedersen said that was 
a 300000 jump in both categories handguns and rifles from the 
previous year and officials believe the number probably increased 
in 1988

about 200000 spectators 
will converge on this mojave desert military base to watch discovery 
land early saturday nasa predicted 
national aeronautics and space administration spokeswoman nancy 
lovato said wednesday that the crowd would be that big because 
its a weekend landing at the beginning of spring vacation 
the space shuttle and its fiveman crew is scheduled to touch 
down at 634 am capping a fiveday mission highlighted by 
deployment of a 100 million communications satellite and 
experiments aimed at developing new medicines and learning how bones 
heal and chicken embryos develop in the weightlessness of space 
trouble with a valve on board discovery had threatened to end the 
mission a day early but it was apparently fixed wednesday and nasa 
is aiming for a saturday landing 
nasa officials said wednesday that because of a desire to perform 
handling and braking tests discovery might land on concrete runway 
22 instead of on its normal landing strip runway 17 which is on 
the unpaved clay surface of rogers dry lake 
runway 17 is roughly three miles from the public viewing site on 
the lakebeds east shore runway 22 is about 45 miles but its 
still a good view youll see em fly right past lovato said 
meanwhile five airmen playing the role of injured astronauts 
were rescued wednesday from a makebelieve space shuttle fire in an 
emergency drill by ground crews who will greet discovery when it 
returns saturday nasa routinely holds such simulations before real 
shuttle landings 
the east shore viewing site will be open to the public 24 hours 
before the landing and vehicle passes are not required but gates 
to the main parts of edwards air force base will be closed to anyone 
not on official business 
access to the viewing site will be closed one hour before the 
landing lovato said 
lovato said the two largest crowds for shuttle landings numbered 
500000 when columbia landed here on july 4 1982 and 410000 on 
oct 3 when discovery glided to the desert floor to complete the 
first shuttle flight since challenger blew up after liftoff on jan 
28 1986

state and congressional housing experts say a 
federal panel charged with coordinating programs for the homeless 
has done little or nothing to address the problem 
witnesses at a congressional hearing wednesday lambasted the 
interagency council on the homeless saying it has not met its 
legislative mandate 
the criticism came at a joint hearing of two house panels as the 
senate subcommittee on housing introduced legislation touted by 
sponsors as the framework for a new national housing strategy 
the litany of the councils failures began in the opening 
statement from rep cardiss collins dill who chairs the 
government activities and transportation subcommittee 
collins said the council has failed almost completely to carry 
out the mandates set for it by congress she said 
the council was established in 1987 by title ii of the mckinney 
act to coordinate 20 new programs created by the act it is supposed 
to provide information on the programs and help state and local 
governments and nonprofit organizations implement them 
rep tom lantos dcalif chairman of the employment and housing 
subcommittee said much of the information that homeless providers 
needed to apply for mckinney money was provided instead by the 
national governors association 
wendy adler of the nga testified that after receiving numerous 
questions from states she developed a report on the status of 
programs under the mckinney act and related legislation she said 
the report has now been updated three times 
this publication contains the type of information the council 
should be disseminating said adler 
other witnesses said the council in a year and a half since 
enactment of mckinney failed to hire a complete staff or identify 
regional and field coordinators for programs it focused too much on 
the development of an electronic data base which housing providers 
could not use often sent information regarding application 
deadlines late met just five times and produced only three monthly 
newsletters which contained useless information the witnesses said 
cassandra moore the councils former executive director blamed 
a lack of resources the duties with which the council is charged 
and its ability to carry them out must be brought into balance 
she said 
moore said congress gave the council broad authority to develop 
programs and issue timetables but not the power or resources to do 
the job 
she recommended increasing the staff size and removing the 
council from the administrative wing of the department of housing 
and urban development which she said has been unwilling to share 
information 
the council composed of the heads or their designees of 10 
cabinet departments and five independent agencies was headed under 
the reagan administration by thenhousing secretary samuel pierce 
the bush administration has yet to choose his successor

federal officials prepared to vaccinate 
5000 people at an indian reservation today as the nations largest 
current outbreak of meningitis claimed a fifth victim 
a 17yearold girl died early wednesday becoming the fifth 
victim in southcentral washington this year seventeen people 
mostly children have contracted meningitis or another form of 
meningococcal disease since jan 10 
it is very tragic and we are very concerned said linda 
topel assistant director of the yakima county health district we 
are in an outbreak situation 
although there are isolated cases of meningococcal disease around 
the country all the time the yakima outbreak is the largest current 
cluster said dr anne schuchat of the centers of disease control in 
atlanta 
the mortality rate of nearly 30 percent in the yakima cases is 
far higher than the national average of 10 percent among the 3000 
annual cases she said 
the six meningitis cases involve a bacteria that attacks the 
lining around the spinal cord and brain while the meningococcemia 
cases involve a bacteria that attacks the blood stream ms schuchat 
said 
doctors at the cdc plan to study the yakima outbreak to see if a 
particularly deadly strain of the meningococcal bacteria is involved 
anxious parents have deluged county and state health officers 
with phone calls wondering if they should have their children 
vaccinated officials said 
county health officials vaccinated 2300 people in two 
communities where schoolchildren were exposed to the bacteria by an 
infected child doctors said 
in addition the federal indian health service planned to begin 
vaccinating 5000 residents of the yakima indian reservation today 
because indians living in close quarters were considered at greater 
risk of contracting the disease 
no decision has been reached yet on whether to vaccinate more 
than 60000 people under age 25 in the entire county of 184000 
residents ms topel said 
the vaccinations are given to people under age 25 because most 
adults who become infected with the bacteria do not become sick 
the latest victim had been hospitalized since feb 7 after 
reporting a flulike illness he said the others who have died were 
three children under the age of 18 months and a 23yearold man 
no new cases have been confirmed since last weekend and officials 
have no other suspected cases

a 200yearold mainstay of treatment for congestive 
heart failure will continue to play its key role after research 
showed that a highly touted replacement is not as good for many 
patients experts say 
when testing began several years ago with the new drug called 
milrinone some experts predicted it would supplant digitalis as the 
medicine of choice for the 4 million americans with congestive heart 
failure 
the latest study published today compared milrinone to a form 
of digitalis called digoxin in people with mild to moderate heart 
failure 
although milrinone worked it was not as effective as digoxin 
those receiving it did worse and suffered more side effects 
the clinical wisdom of a few years ago that it would be a 
replacement for digitalis is not correct said dr robert 
dibianco who directed the study it will not replace digitalis 
experts said the findings were surprising and disappointing but 
in an editorial published with the study in the new england journal 
of medicine dr jay n cohn of the university of minnesota said 
the good news for now is that digoxin can be used with greater 
confidence in its efficacy 
doctors also said there should still be a place for milrinone 
because it may be used in people who cannot tolerate digitalis 
dibianco said he would like to be able to prescribe milrinone for 
such people but for the majority of my patients digitalis now 
even more firmly becomes the standard drug 
dibianco a researcher at washington adventist hospital in takoma 
park md was the studys principal author research was conducted 
on 230 patients at 32 hospitals 
an injected form of milrinone produced by sterling drug was 
approved by the us food and drug administration last year for 
shortterm treatment of acute heart failure however the fda has 
yet to clear the medicines pill form which was used in the latest 
study 
in the threemonth comparison study patients with mild to 
moderate heart failure were randomly assigned to take milrinone 
diuretics digoxin or a combination of these drugs 
the conditions of 20 percent of those taking milrinone 
deteriorated within two weeks after treatment began compared with 
only 3 percent of those receiving digoxin side effects of milrinone 
included palpitations irregular heartbeat lightheadedness low 
blood pressure nervousness and headaches 
among those who once suggested that milrinone might replace 
digitalis was dr donald s baim of beth israel hospital in boston 
his early results showed that the drug helped people with severe 
congestive heart failure who did not respond to other medicines 
although the latest results are disappointing he said i still 
believe that there is a clear beneficial role in the patient who has 
heart failure that is refractory to the conventional agents

images of violence catchy music 
and casual character assassination were among the dominant features 
of an election campaign that tried to stick to the airwaves and stay 
off of the streets 
for one thing radio and television advertisements were much 
safer than public appearances in this country where expressing your 
political preference can be lethal 
the campaign ended wednesday with a burst of such advertistments 
and a rally by the leftist democratic convergence no campaigning is 
permitted from today until sundays presidential balloting 
the political parties knew that more than 85 percent of 
salvadorans homes have radios the most pervasive medium in a 
country where personal messages from one town to another are relayed 
between songs on music stations 
there are 51 am stations in the country of 55 million people 3 
million radio receivers and 45 million daily listeners 
now salvadorans are being asked to go to the polls to pick a 
president under the threat of violence by the leftist guerrillas of 
the farabundo marti national liberation front whose nineyear war 
against the ussupported government has claimed 70000 lives 
the rebels as in previous elections have threatened violence 
and urged voters to stay home on election day 
in 1984 nearly 75 percent of the voters cast ballots they chose 
christian democrat jose napoleon duarte as president and gave a 
strong second place to a surging rightwing party the republican 
nationalist alliance that now threatens to wrest power from the 
christian democrats 
political parties avoided big rallies both in the capital and in 
the countryside during this years fourmonth campaign a republican 
nationalist alliance rally on saturday was the largest of the 
campaign drawing more than 20000 people in the capital 
most election work was carried out by party volunteers working 
city blocks and at socalled carnivals where party leaders 
mingled with the people while local bands played and liquor flowed 
several people were killed in the early days of the campaign the 
leftist guerrillas threatened city mayors then killed nine of them 
and leaders of the two dominant parties accused each other of 
political slayings 
as a result all the parties took the lions share of their 
campaigns to the airwaves 
several sectors of society principally the roman catholic 
church harshly criticized the mudslinging that marked the ads 
the christian democrats ran a television ad that showed a 
bloodcovered mans body on the floor followed by an image of a 
similarily butchered woman 
this is the kind of violence arena brought to the country 
says a guttural voice over a horror movie soundtrack playing on 
accusations that republican nationalist alliance known as arena is 
linked to rightwing death squads who killed thousands of reputed 
leftists in the early 1980s 
arena ran radio ads alleging that christian democrat candidate 
fidel chavez mena embezzled or squandered millions of dollars some 
of it destined for victims of the 1986 earthquake 
both parties denied each others accusations 
the leftist democratic convergence ran television ads showing 
soldiers firing on crowds while a voice sang let me not be 
indifferent to pain 
the three parties flooded the airwaves on wednesday but the 
wellfunded rightist party had by far the most broadcast time 
of course not only do we benefit from the propaganda but we 
block others said an arena campaign organizer speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
but the airwaves arent reserved for the parties 
the rebels spoke to voters with their clandestine radio 
venceremos taking credit for an attack on the presidential palace 
and threatening election workers in an effort to enforce their 
election boycott

riot police stormed a subway depot and 
arrested more than 2300 workers who staged a wildcat strike today 
paralyzing seouls subway system and stranding thousands of 
commuters 
most of the systems workers went on strike to demand dismissal 
of the subway chief for bad faith in labor negotiations the 
government organized emergency transport with about 10000 extra 
buses and military vehicles 
the 3 million people who use the subway daily in the city of 
about 10 million people struggled to find alternate transport buses 
were packed and taxis carried up to five passengers each 
about 4000 riot police stormed a subway depot to disperse 3000 
strikers who had seized the facility during the night and erected 
barricades police armored trucks fired tear gas and bulldozers 
knocked down the barricades 
some strikers armed with steel pipes and clubs hurled firebombs 
at police before they were overpowered 
police officials said 2344 strikers had been arrested at the 
subway depot most would be released but charges were being 
prepared against about 30 union leaders for leading an illegal 
strike the officials said 
officials of the cityowned seoul subway corp said they were 
maintaining limited service on some lines with managers 
nonstriking workers and locomotive drivers from the national 
railroad system officials said 
a sudden snow storm that hit seoul during the morning added to 
congestion and confusion in streets clogged with heavy traffic 
subway officials said about 6000 of the systems 7732 workers 
were involved in the protest it was the first strike in the 
subways 15year history apart from a twohour stoppage last june 
mayor koh kun apologized to commuters for the inconvenience we 
want the strikers to return to work and drop their unjust demands 
he said 
subway president kim myongnong ordered strikers to return to 
work by early friday or face disciplinary action but union 
officials who declined to be named said they had no intention of 
returning until their demands were met and all arrested strikers 
were released and charges dropped 
the strikers had ignored a government order for a 15day cooling 
off period imposed late wednesday after lastminute negotiations 
failed on their demand that the subway corporation president be 
dismissed 
union leaders said kim had acted in bad faith during earlier 
labor talks and demanded koh sign a new agreement on pay and working 
conditions because they did not trust the subway corporation 
the mayor said he could not sign the agreement because he did not 
represent the subway corporation 
strikers also demanded withdrawal of law suits against labor 
leaders who organized protests last week subway workers allowed 
commuters to ride free for four days last week

three years ago the gwinnett county 
police switched from their old brownonbrown police cars hoping 
for a new image 
the new cars white with a yellow lightning streak down the 
sides made an impression all right 
most of the officers just roll their eyes when the color of the 
cars is brought up or they get this look of disgust on their 
face chief charles wayne bolden said tuesday 
so after only a week on the job bolden has decided that the 
yellow goes 
maybe im too much of a traditionalist he said i dont 
really see many police cars marked that way 
every time i see them i feel like yelling out shazam like 
in the captain marvel comic books 
a new decal will be phased in with new cars as budget allocations 
allow bolden said

hostages in lebanon live in a world of hopelessness 
and neglect imprisoned as much by public indifference as by their 
extremist captors a former hostage says in an editorial published 
today 
jeanpaul kauffmann a french journalist held by shiite moslem 
kidnappers in lebanon for three years marked the anniversary of the 
capture of fellow hostage terry anderson with a wrenching plea for 
rekindled interest in the captives 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press was captured four years ago today and has been held longer 
than any of the other 14 western hostages in lebanon 
in todays editions of the newspaper le monde kauffmann says the 
hostages are no longer objects of mass compassion no longer 
bargaining chips no longer even political symbols 
the truth is that the hostages in lebanon today have become the 
damned of the west he wrote without hope of being saved 
imprisoned in silence and darkness deprived of the sight of the 
world of the living forgotten they no longer represent anything 
hostages such as anderson are kept blindfolded and chained 
robbed of their humanity he wrote 
this absence of senses is the worst punishment that one can 
inflict on a human being the most tragic thing is that this torment 
is administered as much from the outside by countries and people 
indifferent to their fate as on the inside by their captors who 
also work to make them insignificant as men 
the captors condemned us to the chain they made us blind 
better to bend us and subjugate us we had to become things a 
hostage is above all a package which is logical because he is the 
object of a swap 
he said britain and the united states also consider the hostages 
as merchandise and in believing they are devaluing the 
hostages by abandonment and silence have made them nonexistent 
the western hostages no longer exist for anybody except for 
their families 
perhaps the governments think the kidnappers will end up by 
getting tired and letting them go kauffmann said but this 
calculation has proved false 
france won the release of its countrymen because it cared about 
its hostages he said it was the spirit of solidarity of the 
french people that provoked the political will of the government 
nearly all paris dailies today devoted stories to anderson who 
also was the subject of numerous radio reports radio france network 
carried reports on anderson nearly every half hour during prime time 
morning newscasts 
charles glass an american journalist who escaped after two 
months of captivity in 1987 said in london 
now is the time for the kidnappers and those for whom they work 
to release terry anderson and the other hostages in lebanon and show 
the world that they believe in the mercy of god 
hesham el essawy chairman of the londonbased islamic society 
for the promotion of religious tolerance said we hope and pray 
that this tragic situation will end soon we are very confident that 
this aspiration will be supported by every honest moslem in the 
world today 
their statements were released through article 19 an 
anticensorship organization 
also the australian journalists association today called on the 
australian government to take whatever steps necessary to aid in the 
release of the hostages association federal secretary christopher 
warren said the group also has written syria and iran asking them to 
intervene 
kauffmann was released may 4 1988 with french diplomats marcel 
fontaine and marcel carton islamic jihad the group that holds 
anderson kidnapped kauffmann on may 22 1985 
kauffmann spent his last six months of captivity in the company 
of american hostages first thomas sutherland then frank reed 
sutherland 57 acting dean of agriculture at the american 
university of beirut was abducted june 9 1985 reed 56 director 
of the lebanese international school was kidnapped sept 9 1986

the romeo and juliet romance of a 
16yearold greek cypriot schoolgirl and a 17yearold turkish 
settler has stirred political passions on this divided east 
mediterranean island 
the love story has underlined the deeprooted divisions that 
plague cyprus 15 years after turkey invaded and seized the northern 
onethird of the island 
and even though the young man was deported this week by greek 
cypriot officials the story in its small way symbolizes hopes of 
reunification as leaders of the rival communities try to find ways 
to bring them together 
there was an uproar in the greek cypriot south in september when 
the turkish moslem cengis coksun seytan and alexia chronia a 
christian were married in a widely publicized moslem ceremony in 
the north 
alexia was only 15 at the time she is only the second greek 
cypriot girl known to have married a turk since the 1974 invasion 
her family is part of a small isolated greek community in the 
karpas region of the north following the flight or expulsion of 
200000 greek cypriots after the invasion 
greek cypriots were incensed not just that one of their own would 
marry a turk but one of the 50000 mainland turks shipped to the 
north to increase the turkish cypriot population which is 
outnumbered 41 by greek cypriots 
the greek cypriots demand the withdrawal of all the settlers and 
some 30000 turkish troops from the north before a settlement can be 
reached on reunification 
hardline greek cypriots alleged the girl had been kidnapped some 
officers in the united nations peacekeeping force believe the 
hardliners sought to undermine the talks between their political 
leaders 
the greek cypriot press angrily demanded action by the un 
force which supervises the living conditions of the greek cypriots 
left in karpas to rescue alexia high school students staged 
protest demonstrations demanding un action 
un officers reported they found no evidence of coercion and 
that alexia was happy greek cypriots called that a coverup 
anger was fueled when turkish cypriot television seen in the 
south broadcast the marriage of cengis and alexia and announced 
that turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash had given the couple an 
expensive wedding present 
greek cypriot newspapers claimed the marriage was a turkish 
attempt to prove to the world that the mainland settlers were being 
assimilated and were even acceptable to greek cypriots 
in february when alexia crossed to the south she claimed she had 
indeed been kidnapped and forced to convert to islam before being 
pushed into marrying seytan 
a few weeks later seytan slipped across the socalled green line 
that divides the island to become a christian so he and alexia could 
live in the more prosperous south 
he was immediately arrested and held in jail on charges he had 
kidnapped alexia and entered the republic of cyprus illegally 
alexia then changed her story saying she had been forced by her 
own family to concoct the kidnap story to save them from the 
humiliation of her love for a turk and conversion to islam 
id go to the end of the world to be with him she said of 
the curly haired seytan 
seytan said during a brief court appearance i love her i want 
to see her why wont they let me 
nonetheless the greek cypriot authorities ruled that he should 
be deported as an illegal immigrant they carried out the order 
tuesday he was flown to athens greece and then to istanbul 
turkey alexia said she doesnt know what she will do but had no 
plans to go to turkey 
some greek cypriots newspapers insist that alexias denial of 
being kidnapped followed turkish warnings they would harm her family 
still in the north if she told the truth 
but other newspapers have become sympathetic and urged tolerance 
if these two youngsters are really in love why dont we accept 
the fact and let them live in peace the independent epikeri 
weekly said in an editorial why do we object so violently and 
fight this possibility

iran says the current 
middle east tour of prince charles and princess diana is a hostile 
affront to moslems who want britain to ban salman rushdies novel 
the satanic verses 
tehran radio on wednesday accused the british government of 
trying to exploit the trip and give a cold shoulder to the 
worlds moslems but it warned that britain could not avoid facing 
their wrath 
on the second day of their official visit to the united arab 
emirates wednesday the heir to the british throne and his wife were 
steeped in arab traditions there was camel racing sword dancing 
and openair lamb roasting 
the couple is on an official oneweek tour of kuwait bahrain and 
the emirates that was announced last june charles will then fly 
alone to saudi arabia for a private visit 
tehran radio monitored in london noted that the visit was 
taking place while the 45nation organization of islamic conference 
was meeting in the saudi capital riyadh with the satanic 
verses at the top of the agenda 
iran on wednesday told conference delegates it was honored to 
have broken relations with britain over the rushdie affair it 
reiterated its call for the execution of indianborn british author 
first issued feb 14 by fundamentalist patriarch ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini 
now under such circumstances when the british government has 
applied all its resources for inflicting a blow upon islam and 
insulting our prophet how can the presence of the british crown 
prince in islamic states be justified said a commentary by tehran 
radio 
many moslems say the satanic verses blasphemes islam by 
suggesting the koran islams holy book was invented by the prophet 
mohammed rather than received directly from god and for giving 
prostitutes the names of mohammeds wives

a convicted copkiller granted clemency in 
1985 may go free as early as friday said state parole officials who 
voted to release him 
a threemember panel of the state board of parole voted 
unanimously wednesday to release gary mcgivern who some saw as an 
unrepentant murderer 
but mcgivern also had some wellknown supporters including folk 
singer pete seeger conservative columnist william f buckley and 
civil rights lawyer william kunstler 
its been a long haul ive been in this for 13 years said 
kunstler im happy for gary his wife and his family 
michael kavanagh the prosecutor who won the 25 years to life 
sentences handed mcgivern 44 and codefendant charles culhane 
said the parole boards decision was a sad commentary on our 
criminal justive system 
gov mario cuomos grant of clemency for mcgivern on new years 
eve 1985 was denounced by many new york law enforcement officials 
and by then vice president george bush at the time cuomo was 
considered a potential 1988 presidential contender 
although cuomos clemency made mcgivern immediately eligible for 
parole consideration the state board twice refused to free him 
before wednesdays hearing at otisville state prison where mcgivern 
was being held 
the boards executive director edward elwin said mcgivern could 
be freed as early as friday 
through three trials mcgivern and culhane steadfastly maintained 
their innocence in the 1968 shooting death of william fitzgerald a 
westchester county deputy during an escape attempt 
maurice fitzgerald the 86yearold brother of the slain deputy 
said mcgivern should have been kept in prison for life 
but what are you going to do he said after the parole board 
decision theres nothing i can do about it 
mcgivern wasnt granting interviews wednesday but culhane said 
his friends parole was wonderful 
culhane said he felt the parole boards decision might help his 
bid for early release thus far cuomo has refused to grant culhane 
clemency and hes not eligible for a parole hearing until late 1991 
thats when mcgivern would have been first eligible for parole 
without cuomos clemency 
in the past the board had cited the serious nature of the crime 
in keeping mcgivern behind bars on wednesday the board noted 
mcgiverns outstanding record while in prison 
leading the effort to win mcgiverns freedom has been freelance 
writer marguerite culp a former newspaper reporter who met mcgivern 
while he was in prison and married him on the 10th anniversary of 
the shooting 
elwin said mcgivern and his wife planned to live at her home in 
woodstock 
thats not far from where mcgivern culhane and inmate robert 
bowerman according to prosecutor kavanagh tried to escape while 
being transported from state prison to a court appearance at the 
time mcgivern and culhane were serving state prison sentences for 
the armed robbery of a gas station bowerman a jailhouse lawyer 
was helping them appeal their convictions 
fitzgerald and bowerman were fatally shot and mcgivern and 
culhane were wounded kavanagh said it was mcgivern who fired the 
shot that killed fitzgerald 
even though mcgivern and culhane have maintained bowerman acted 
alone a second deputy in the car joseph singer said they were 
involved singer has since committed suicide

for the more than 400 commuters riding the 
rockporttoboston train the days of poetry readings and words of 
good cheer have ended 
alan mcmillan engineer of the massachusetts bay transportation 
commuter rail train no 110 has been told to stop talking to 
passengers over the public address system 
the 42yearold mcmillan a railroad man since he was a teenager 
and an engineer for 15 years began his commentaries soon after 
taking over no 110 two years ago he began by making occasional 
observations about the weather and other things as the train passed 
through marshlands leading into boston 
he expanded his repertoire last month after returning from a 
vacation that included a train ride from chicago to seattle during 
which he heard a clubcar attendant recite poetry as part of his 
announcement he was closing the bar 
i thought wow what a great idea mcmillan said 
and he began short readings usually poetry and always something 
he considered upbeat 
he read while he drove the train through a work zone at 2 mph and 
kept one hand on the brake 
passengers thanked him as they walked past his cab and they 
wrote letters commending him one called him the goodwill 
ambassador of the commuter rails 
but after pulling into north station on wednesday morning 
mcmillan said an amtrak supervisor told him unnamed higherups 
wanted him to stop the massachusetts bay transportation authority 
hires amtrak to run its commuter trains 
he told me the feeling is that somebody someday is going to 
say something like how is he going to be able to drive the train 
while doing that sort of thing mcmillan said 
the boston globe said the amtrak supervisor wayne laxton 
declined to discuss the matter but transit authority spokesman 
peter dimond said his agency was concerned after the newspaper 
inquired about mcmillans popularity 
dimond said officials thought what mcmillan was doing was a 
direct violation of regulations 
engineers are expected to give undivided attention to driving 
the train and not doing anything but driving the train he said 
earlier mcmillan said i have not been seeking notoriety i 
began because i noticed that people getting off the train were never 
smiling that it always seemed to be back to the salt mines for 
them i do this because of the positive effect that it has on 
people

witnesses recounted brushes with death and 
identified a 61yearold retired librarian as the gunman who killed 
six people and wounded 10 in a 1987 shooting rampage 
during an emotional third day of testimony in circuit court 
wednesday eight witnesses said william bryan cruse was purposeful 
precise and without emotion during the shootout at two florida 
supermarkets in palm bay on floridas eastern coast 
it wasnt a zombietype look said robert jones who helped 
usher people to safety during the april 23 1987 attack and came 
within about 15 feet of the gunman at one point it was more or 
less like somebody who had a job to do 
cruse is charged with six counts of firstdegree murder 28 
counts of attempted murder and two counts of kidnapping 
lawyers for cruse who could face the death penalty do not deny 
he was responsible but they say he was temporarily insane at the 
time the trial was moved inland to this central florida town 
because of heavy local news coverage 
to deflate the insanity claims prosecutors asked each witness in 
detail how cruse acted during the shooting hoping to prove his 
actions were deliberate 
publix store manager john brubaker employee babetta peterson and 
shopper douglas pollock all said the gunman appeared to be in 
control as he methodically took aim with his semiautomatic rifle at 
human targets 
mrs peterson and her daughter arrived at the store as cruse sped 
into the parking lot and got out of his car with what appeared to be 
a rifle she testified 
then she saw the gunman shoot two young men who were coming out 
of the store as the men crumpled to the ground the gunman 
approached them and shot again mrs peterson said 
he was holding it up like so and pointing it downward to where 
they were she said crying on the witness stand as she described 
how the gun was handled 
pollock said he saw two men lying motionless on the ground and a 
third man running away yelling in a foreign accent oh god oh 
god 
the three men were kuwaiti students two died and the third was 
seriously wounded

students who were trying to leave china but a ghanian diplomat said 
his country had yet to decide what to do with the approximately two 
dozen ghanian students in china

days in nanking said he will stay in january dosoo told the 
associated press he was determined to leave china 
about 1500 african students most on chinese scholarships 
currently study in china as part of beijings policy to cultivate 
close ties with the third world

work crews gathered to dismantle tilted arc 
just hours after the creator of the steel sculpture ended a 
lastditch effort to keep it at a federal office plaza 
richard serra who has maintained that merely moving the 73ton 
work from the site would destroy its artistic integrity said 
wednesday that the removal is a very thoughtless and barbaric 
act 
this country pays lip service to salman rushdie and turns 
around and destroys my piece said serra referring to the british 
author who had a price put on his head in iran because of his book 
the satanic verses which many moslem leaders labeled 
blasphemous 
hours earlier serras lawyer jay topkis announced were 
dropping all of our efforts to do anything about their destroying 
tilted arc 
serra has been battling in and out of court for the last four 
years to prevent the government from removing the sculpture from 
federal plaza in lower manhattan where it was unveiled in 1981 
workmen were ready to dismantle and remove the 120footlong 
12foot high wall of curving rusty steel over the weekend until 
the government agreed to wait pending further legal maneuvering by 
topkis 
topkis previously sought a delay to which federal lawyers 
consented to research whether the work was protected under the 
moral rights clause of a 19thcentury international copyright 
treaty 
but he said he concluded that the treaty from the berne 
convention which the united states joined two weeks ago does not 
bar the government from destroying this work of one of our 
countrys most distinguished artists 
previously serra lost a 30 million damage suit against the us 
general services administration which commissioned the work for 
175000 in 1979 
gsa decided to remove the work after numerous complaints that it 
was an eyesore that bisected the plaza preventing its use for large 
public gatherings said william j diamond regional administrator 
of the agency 
this is an important victory for the people of lower manhattan 
who will now be able to regain the use of the plaza which has been 
denied to them for seven years by tilted arc said diamond 
diamond said the work would be stored under guard at a government 
parking lot in brooklyn gsa plans an outdoor cafe trees and other 
greenery for federal plaza he said 
no permanent relocation site for the sculpture has been picked

two rocket problems that forced postponement of the launch of a 
satellite designed to test sensors for the star wars missile

lt col ron rand an air force spokesman we dont know whether 
it will be 24 hours or longer

fawaz younis the lebanese man convicted here 
of hijacking a plane in beirut in 1985 denounced terrorism in an 
interview broadcast today and said the united states was showing 
off by arresting him 
i am sorry to say i have been imprisoned because the united 
states government would like to show off younis speaking through 
an interpreter said on the cbs nightwatch program 
repeating his courtroom claim that he had been a member of the 
amal militia carrying out a military orders younis said he was not 
an international terrorist as portrayed by us authorities 
if my brother would harm civilians i would be against him 
he said in the interview which was taped wednesday night 
younis was found guilty by a us district court jury of 
hijacking a royal jordanian airliner from the beirut airport in 1985 
and holding 70 people two of them americans for 30 hours the jury 
acquitted him of charges that he used or threatened violence against 
crew members or passengers and that he helped blow up the aircraft 
the hijacked plane was used to deliver to an arab league meeting 
in tunisia amals demand that armed palestinians be removed from 
lebanon 
younis 30 was lured to arrest in an elaborate trap the fbi set 
on a yacht in the mediterranean sea us officials call his 
conviction a successful test of a 1984 statute giving the united 
states jurisdiction over the taking of american hostages abroad 
younis remains imprisoned under heavy guard and faces a possible 
sentence of life in prison but he said he was tried unfairly for 
taking orders as a member of the amal militia seeking an end to 
lebanons 14yearold civil war 
the leaders of amal are not terrorists he said they will 
not terrorize anyone they will not harm innocent people 
we had an objective terrorist acts do not serve to end the 
war terrorism harms civilians to serve objectives which have 
nothing to do with the war 
younis said he was the wrong target if the us aim was to strike 
against antiamerican terrorism 
but i would like to leave the judgment on this issue to the 
american people he said had i had any hate or problem with the 
american government i would have harmed those two american 
citizens the testimony proves in court they were well treated they 
were even better treated than the lebanese citizens who were on 
board that flight

churches won a court victory over the 
governments electronic war against the sanctuary movement but four 
arizona churches must meet another test to keep their lawsuit alive 
a federal appeals court ruled 
in a dispute that grew out of the federal governments use of 
electronic surveillance to track the sanctuary movement the court 
ruled unanimously wednesday that churches have the right to sue over 
the issue 
of course were delighted said susan parrott a member of 
the southside presbyterian church in tucson ariz weve always 
felt that the infiltrators in our church were a disgrace 
but in order to keep their lawsuit alive the churches must prove 
that the surveillance is continuing or likely to resume according 
to the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruling a federal judge in 
phoenix must weigh the evidence the court said 
peter baird a lawyer for the churches called the 30 ruling a 
great stride forward toward protecting worship services from 
electronic surveillance 
justice department spokeswoman amy brown declined to comment 
patrick kane phoenix district director of the federal immigration 
and naturalization service said he had not seen the ruling and 
could not comment 
the court did not say whether government infiltration and secret 
recording of church services without a search warrant would 
violate freedom of religion or the constitutional ban on 
unreasonable searches 
that is a key issue in the pending appeal of eight sanctuary 
movement workers including five members of the clergy convicted in 
tucson in 1986 of a variety of immigration charges including 
illegally harboring and transporting central american refugees 
it was disclosed in that case that paid government informants had 
secretly recorded worship services and bible classes a federal 
prosecutor said the surveillance was proper because the church was 
the site of a criminal conspiracy 
the criminal appeal was argued before another panel of the 9th 
circuit last december and has not yet been decided 
the civil suit that led to wednesdays ruling was filed by 
churches in phoenix and tucson they said informants working for the 
immigration and naturalization service attended and secretly 
recorded their services between march 1984 and january 1985 
once the surveillance was disclosed church officials said their 
attendance declined a bible study group was canceled and members 
became more reluctant to seek pastoral counseling and less open in 
their prayers and confessions 
the suit sought a ruling that the surveillance was improper and a 
court order banning it in the future 
us district judge charles hardy dismissed the suit without a 
trial saying that even if all the allegations were true the 
churches as organizations had not been harmed but the appeals court 
disagreed 
when congregants are chilled from participating in worship 
activities when they refuse to attend worship services because they 
fear the government is spying on them and taping their every 
utterance we think a church suffers organizational injury 
because its ability to carry out its ministries has been impaired 
said the opinion by judge william norris

president bush is being asked to back up his 
presidential campaign rhetoric blasting gov michael s dukakis for 
failing to clean up boston harbor 
dukakis for whom the polluted harbor became a political 
liability asked the bush administration wednesday to put its 
money where its mouth was 
when you make the kind of statements that were made in the 
campaign youve got an obligation to make good on them dukakis 
said 
the governor faulted bush for proposing cutbacks in federal 
wastewater construction programs that would cost massachusetts 40 
million in addition he charged that while congress has earmarked 
59 million for the boston harbor project the bush administration 
has not included those funds in its budget 
dukakis said he was confident the massachusetts congressional 
delegation would reverse those decisions 
bush as the republican candidate for president staged a 
surprise cruise in september on boston harbor to criticize dukakis 
for pollution 
dukakis supporters argued that the governor was primarily 
responsible for the legislation designed to end the pollution by the 
next century 
but the charges reinforced by a republican campaign tv 
commercial stuck to dukakis leaving the democrat on the defensive 
im proud to say that as of today were right on schedule 
and thats the way were going to keep it dukakis told reporters 
wednesday flanked by environmental affairs secretary john devillars 
and massachusetts water resources authority executive director paul 
levy 
the governor ticked off a series of steps already taken to 
address the harbor pollution beginning with the creation of the 
water resources authority 
noting that the agency has already spent 350 million of the 
projected 65 billion cost dukakis said the state water authority 
has stopped the discharge of floating scum from its aging 
treatment plants at nut island and deer island 
dukakis promised that families will notice cleaner beaches this 
summer in the metropolitan area

ante markovic was installed today as 
premier and promised a series of democraticoriented economic and 
political initiatives to roust this communist country from a 
nineyear economic slide 
markovic said in his inaugural speech that a freemarket economy 
is the ultimate achievement of mankind for which no alternative 
has yet been found a new cabinet was also sworn in 
there is no solution to the economic crisis without the 
strengthening of political democracy in the country he said 
urging the creation of a new modern socialist system 
the new premier said this balkan country of 23 million people has 
to undergo a fundamental change in order to revive the economy 
yugoslavia is burdened by 346 percent annual inflation and a 21 
billion foreign debt 
markovic indicated he would seek closer links the west including 
greater economic cooperation with the european economic community 
he advocates reshaping the countrys banking system along western 
lines creating a stock market and ending state subsidies to 
moneylosing companies 
yugoslavia which split from the soviet bloc in 1948 is a 
founding member of the nonaligned movement and both superpowers 
vie for its good graces 
markovic a successful businessman called for an immediate 
introduction of shares and bonds private initiative and 
entrepreneurship and an end to state interference in the operation 
of businesses 
markovic a former president of the croatian republic succeeds 
branko mikulic who together with his entire cabinet resigned dec 
30 
mikulics government was the first to resign since the communist 
party took power after world war ii he stepped down following his 
governments failure to solve the countrys daunting social and 
economic problems including a dramatic rise in social and ethnic 
unrest 
economic problems have been accompanied by a resurgence of 
historic ethnic rivalries a this loose federation of six republics 
and two autonomous provinces 
much of the recent unrest has centered on the southern province 
of kosovo where ethnic albanians form a majority of 90 percent 
markovics 19member cabinet the smallest in postwar history is 
a mix of prominent politicians and technocrats with only two 
ministers retaining the seats they occupied in mikulics government 
foreign minister budimir loncar and defense minister gen veljko 
kadijevic remained in the new administration while dobrosav 
culafic interior minister in mikulics government lost his job 
culafic was replaced following severe public criticism of his 
handling of tensions in kosovo where emergency measures were 
imposed last month in order to prevent clashes between ethnic 
albanians and slavs living there 
the important interior ministry went to gen petar gracanin 
president of the largest republic of serbia of which kosovo is an 
administrative part 
markovic named as vice premiers aleksandar mitrovic serbias 
vice president and zivko pregl executive secretary of the slovene 
communist party 
the choice of vice premiers indicates markovic took a balanced 
stand between slovenia which advocates a market economy and more 
political pluralism and serbia which strives for more centralism 
and political orthodoxy 
in his choice of cabinet members markovic has for the first time 
abandoned the principle of absolute parity among the republics and 
autonomous provinces which strictly adhered to in the past 
provided for equal cabinet representation of all regions 
yugoslavia is run by a state presidency a collective nineman 
body whose chairmanship rotates annually it is the supreme 
commander of the armed forces and executes foreign policy 
the government is responsible for executing economic policy 
while the communist party presidium or politburo has 23 members to 
oversee state activities

the republican bush administration and the 
democraticcontrolled congress are vying furiously to gain credit 
for helping american families afford satisfactory child care 
the white house rushed a longpromised childcare bill to capitol 
hill on wednesday as the senate labor and human resources approved 
by an 115 margin a rival 25 billion program of direct subsidies 
only those families making 13000 or less would be eligible for 
assistance under bushs plan the congressional proposals income 
ceiling would be each states median income the national median for 
a family of four is 32777 
its not a question of whether or not were going to do 
something on child care this year but the direction its going to 
take said sen dan coates rind as the senate panel worked 
toward approval of the measure drafted by sen chris dodd dconn 
and cosponsored by about 40 senate colleagues including a handful 
of republicans 
the bush proposal outlined by press secretary marlin fitzwater 
would provide a tax credit of up to 1000 for each child under age 
4 in working families who make up to 13000 a year he said 25 
million american families would initially benefit from the 
legislation 
such families would be given credit toward the first 14 percent 
of the income they report for tax liability purposes this would 
mean that people in the lowest minimumwage categories of less than 
8000 a year would get less of a benefit than those at the upper 
end of the scale 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo today called the 
administrations approach a 2 percent solution that should be 
part of the more ambitious democratic approach 
i think well probably end up with both she said on abcs 
good morning america one the republican bill is a child 
allowance bill and thats fine but it doesnt deal with child 
care 
fitzwater was questioned aggressively at the midday news briefing 
about the bush administration formula 
you can always pick some number and say is this enough or is 
this too little he said 
but the fact is you need to start someplace it reflects 
budget considerations that we cant afford unlimited costs here 
and obviously if you could pick any number you wanted to and you 
had unlimited billions to spend youd rather pick a much higher 
figure but you do the best you can with what youve got 
during his presidential campaign bush repeatedly cited 
childcare assistance for american families as one of his top 
priorities 
under existing law parents are allowed a 720 credit for child 
care costs incurred in order to accept or keep employment but it 
applies only to families with sufficient income to pay federal 
income taxes 
under bushs plan if a familys income tax liability was less 
than 1000 it would get a refund reflecting the difference between 
the amount owed and the 1000 credit 
the dodd bill similar to a measure that reached the senate floor 
last year but was blocked by an informal filibuster would provide 
benefits to families with children up to age 15 whose income does 
not exceed the median income in the state where they live 
aside from the scope and cost of the programs a major difference 
is that the dodd bill would set up minimum federal standards for day 
care providers although states would be given more than six years 
to comply while the bush measure would leave standards solely to 
the states as they are now 
bush said emphatically in a statement that he opposed having the 
federal government get into the business of regulating the quality 
of child care 
federal policy should increase not decrease the range of 
choices available to parents he said the federal government 
should not become involved in licensing decisions and federal 
financial support should not be made contingent upon state licensing 
decisions 
at a news conference dodd welcomed bushs determination to push 
for child care assistance but ridiculed some aspects of the 
presidents proposal as utterly amazing 
im opposed to any suggestion this is a substitute somehow for 
a meaningful child care bill dodd said he said the 
administrations bill would cover less than 2 percent of the 
population 
while fitzwater gave no estimate of what the bush proposed tax 
credits might cost the treasury dodd and others have said it would 
be minimal probably just a few million dollars 
fitzwater acknowledged that democrats had their own bill and said 
that was one of the reasons why we wanted to get on as soon as 
possible with the administration version 
its a matter where there is a direct philosophical difference 
between republicans and democrats liberals and conservatives and 
one that will be argued probably along those lines in some cases 
fitzwater said but its also a debate i think everybody wants to 
have because both sides of the congress recognize there is a need 
and a desire to do something

the fbi says it is checking into claims by a 
radio station caller that a group called guardians of the islamic 
revolution planted the bomb that destroyed a van driven by the wife 
of the uss vincennes skipper 
meanwhile trustees at the private school where the skippers 
wife teaches scheduled an emergency meeting today in response to 
parents concern about student safety if sharon rogers returns to 
her fourthgrade classroom 
the caller who spoke with a middle eastern accent and claimed to 
be a member of the group linked fridays car bombing to last julys 
downing of an iranian jetliner by a missile fired from the 
vincennes the radio station said 
all 290 people aboard of the jet were killed when capt will c 
rogers iii gave the order to fire in the belief the aircraft was an 
attacking warplane 
the caller to los angeles radio station knx on wednesday also 
threatened additional attacks against rogers wife and all the 
american officers and officials said roger nadel the stations 
executive news producer 
were looking into the claim said fred reagan an fbi 
spokesman in los angeles he declined to elaborate 
terrorist expert david hoffman of the rand corp said he doubts 
the validity of the call because it came five days after the bombing 
and wasnt phoned to a news wire service like most legitimate claims 
for such acts 
guardians of the islamic revolution has told international news 
organizations it was responsible for the dec 21 bombing of pan am 
flight 103 over lockerbie scotland that killed 270 people 
the islamic group also has claimed credit for a july 1987 car 
bombing in england that killed a former minister in the government 
of irans deposed shah mohammed reza pahlavi and the october 1987 
slayings of two opponents of ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis regime 
mrs rogers escaped uninjured in fridays bombing of the family 
van the fbi said the bomb was a nonmilitary device possibly a 
pipe bomb 
fbi spokesman ron orrantia has said no possible motives for the 
attack on the van have been ruled out including retribution for the 
airliner downing 
mrs rogers future at la jolla country day school may be 
discussed at todays board of trustees meeting which was called 
after the school received a bomb threat tuesday board member 
houshmand aftahi said 
police found no explosives but the incident apparently caused 
concern among parents that such threats will continue if mrs rogers 
returns to the school where students will be off the next two weeks 
for spring break 
i hear that some parents are concerned and they want to know 
what the school is going to do about it aftahi said 
were all concerned about the security of our children and we 
feel that her presence on the campus at this point is not good 
an unidentified parent told the los angeles times i think parents 
would prefer that she stay away for the rest of the school year

south africa said today that 
un fundraising efforts to benefit the swapo guerrilla movement 
have raised doubts about the uns impartiality in monitoring the 
namibian independence process 
the united nations has been soliciting funds for the 
international day for the elimination of racial discrimination set 
for march 21 said neil van heerden south africas director general 
of foreign affairs 
he said some of the money raised will go into four funds that are 
spent for the benefit of the southwest african peoples 
organization the un spent about 30 million on swapo from these 
funds last year van heerden said 
swapo has waged a guerrilla war since 1966 in a bid to win 
independence for the territory which has been ruled by south africa 
since world war i 
last year south africa agreed to a un plan that calls for the 
independence process to begin april 1 leading to elections in 
november swapo is favored in the elections but other political 
parties will be competing 
van heerden said there would be hell to pay when these 
parties learn that the un was raising money that would benefit 
swapo 
van heerden also accused swapo of inflating the number of its 
supporters living as refugees outside namibia swapo has said there 
are 80000 refugees while the un has put the figure at around 
60000 and south africa has suggested there might be as few as 
15000 swapo receives funds from various countries and 
organizations on a per capita basis 
the un operation in namibia involves 4650 peacekeeping troops 
and will cost in excess of 400 million 
one of the major namibian political parties today accused 
australian peacekeepers of attending a party of swapo supporters and 
wishing the organization well in the elections 
the democratic turnhalle alliance said about five australian 
peacekeepers went to the party tuesday evening in the northern town 
of grootfontein at one stage one of the australians went to the 
microphone and wished swapo success in the elections the alliance 
said in a statement 
the alliance a multiracial coalition is expected to be swapos 
main competitor in the elections 
about 170 peacekeepers from canada denmark and ireland arrived 
in namibia today to join the un forces more than 20 nations are 
sending troops and administrative personnel to participate in the 
un effort

a federal judge impeached by the house fought 
to hang onto his job in a dramatic personal appeal on the senate 
floor and then sat in silence as lawmakers denounced him for 
inexcusable breaches of the public trust 
standing before the senate district judge alcee l hastings of 
miami declared wednesday he had been acquitted by a jury in 1983 of 
charges of plotting to get a 150000 bribe and said five years of 
postacquittal investigation has produced no new evidence 
i proclaimed my innocence then as i have from the outset and as 
i do now said hastings the first black federal judge in florida 
history 
nearby sat majority leader george mitchell dmaine who resigned 
as a federal judge to come to the senate his expression alert but 
noncommittal a few desks away sen howell heflin dala former 
chief justice of the alabama supreme court thumbed through law 
books and leaned forward from time to time to gaze at hastings 
the senate planned a closeddoor session today to consider the 
appeal from hastings and his attorney terence j anderson for 
dismissal of all but one of the 17 articles of impeachment approved 
by the house 4133 on aug 3 
in an impeachment trial house members serve as the prosecutors 
and the senate acts as the judge and jury 
a decision to go ahead with the impeachment trial would move the 
proceedings to a special committee for hearing evidence followed by 
a floor vote on whether to convict hastings of conspiracy perjury 
and disclosing secret wiretap information in an investigation of 
south florida corruption 
hastings 52 would remain free if convicted but would lose his 
seat on the federal bench and his 89500 annual salary 
packed galleries were ordered by sergeantatarms henry k giugni 
to keep silent on pain of imprisonment as hastings took the 
floor to address an extraordinary senate session with attendance 
among lawmakers unusually high 
the jury heard all the evidence and argument on both sides 
hastings said they were attentive the prosecutors never 
complained about either the quality of the jurors or the attention 
they gave those jurors deliberated carefully they reached a 
conclusion all 12 of them agreed that i was not guilty 
rep john bryant dtexas one of the prosecutors scoffed at 
hastings position he said a doublejeopardy defense did not apply 
in an impeachment trial but that the judge was seizing on it anyway 
to shield himself from the consequences of his inexcusable 
breaches of the public trust 
over five years judge alcee hastings engaged in a clearly 
discernible pattern of misbehavior bryant said 
he conspired to sell his public office for personal gain he 
subverted our judicial process by repeatedly lying under oath and he 
divulged confidential information in violation of his own court 
order house judiciary committee chairman jack brooks dtexas 
told the senate while hastings sat silently at the defense table 
with his attorneys 
today judge hastings asks you to ignore his corrupt conduct 
brooks said in doing so he asks you to rely on a tainted jury 
verdict 
in addition to asserting the double jeopardy defense hastings 
says he cannot get a fair trial because of numerous delays between 
the 1983 criminal trial and now house members say the judge himself 
caused 18 months of delays by fighting a rearguard action to prevent 
lawmakers from getting their hands on evidence 
hastings a 1979 appointee to the federal bench was arrested the 
night of oct 8 1981 in miami hours after a close friend 
washington attorney william borders was caught with a garment bag 
containing 125000 in cash that he had received from an undercover 
fbi agent 
the undercover agent had been posing as frank romano one of two 
brothers already under a threeyear sentence from hastings after 
being convicted of skimming from a teamsters pension fund loan 
the romano brothers who have since died had balked when 
approached about paying a bribe in exchange for a better sentence 
the fbi which had been investigating borders set up a sting 
operation with the undercover man masquerading as romano 
borders at the time a politically influential washington 
criminal lawyer was convicted of promising that hastings would 
change the prison time to probation in exchange for the 150000 
payoff he was sentenced to five years and went to prison after his 
appeals failed 
hastings was in washington for a testimonial dinner for borders 
the day the fbi sprang its trap informed that agents wanted to 
question him he left his suite in the plush lenfant plaza hotel 
without packing or checking out and told a friend he was taking a 
cab to national airport four miles away 
instead he traveled more than 30 miles to baltimorewashington 
international airport and caught a flight to miami but deplaned in 
fort lauderdale and rented a car to drive to miami his own auto at 
the time was parked at the miami airport

moslem guerrillas today claimed they 
shot down two more aircraft in heavy fighting in eastern afghanistan 
and captured two helicopters from afghan soldiers who deserted 
the claim brought to seven the number of communist aircraft the 
insurgents say they have destroyed this week in fierce fighting for 
the strategic city of jalalabad 40 miles west of the pakistan 
border 
there was no immediate comment from afghan government and it was 
not possible to confirm the claims 
reports from the afghan capital indicate moscow has resumed an 
airlift of military supplies to kabul in response to the 10day 
jalalabad offensive which has had some of the heaviest fighting of 
afghanistans civil war 
the lastest reports indicate that afghan soldiers withstood the 
guerrilla offensive on jalalabad and that the fighting has reached a 
stalemate 
no reliable casualty figures are available but estimates run in 
hundreds of dead and thousands of wounded on both sides 
it is the first major showdown between government troops and the 
guerrillas since soviet forces ended nine years of military 
involvement in afghanistan on feb 15 the guerrillas have fought 
the government since 1978 to establish an islamic republic in 
afghanistan 
observers believe a guerrilla victory at jalalabad a key city 
along the main highway from pakistan to kabul could lead to the 
fall of the capital 75 miles to the west 
the guerrillarun afghan news agency said insurgents downed a 
helicopter gunship near jalalabads television station and an 
airplane outside the city on wednesday 
a spokesman for the guerrilla national islamic front of 
afghanistan who demanded anonymity reported crews of two 
helicopter gunships surrendered their craft to guerrillas outside 
the western city of herat near iran 
the guerrillas claim they overran jalalabads most important 
garrison samarkhel to the east of the city and were closing in on 
the airport 
but afghan soldiers have retaliated with unexpectedly aggressive 
aerial and artillery bombardments which reportedly have stalled the 
rebels progress 
 
fighting now centers on suburbs north west and south of the 
city according to reports reaching pakistan today 
the regime militas have been offering stiff resistance to 
guerrilla advances said ijaz gilani a pakistani who monitors 
the war for the semiprivate institute for strategic studies in 
islamabad 
leaders of the pakistani and ussupported guerrillas have 
predicted an early collapse of the kabul government in the absence 
of its soviet backers but afghan president najib has insisted his 
forces are strong enough to survive 
radio kabul said wednesday that over the previous 24 hours 560 
guerrillas and supporters were killed and 252 were wounded it said 
the dead included four americans a saudi national and some 
pakistanis 
pakistan the united states and saudi arabia back the moslem 
guerrillas in their war with the communist government but deny 
having any nationals fighting in afghanistan 
despite communist claims guerrilla sources say they have lost 
only about 150 men in the offensive and captured more than 700 
government troops

discoverys astronauts working again 
at full electrical power received a call from president bush and 
focused cameras on the wounds inflicted on earth by mans pollution 
and natures violence 
flying upside down 180 miles high the fiveman crew captured 
thousands of views of earth with television movie and still 
cameras some of the film will be edited into a study of ecological 
trouble spots 
the president and the crew talked briefly in a combined 
televisiontelephone hookup that let bush see the astronauts in 
their space cabin from the white house 
bush congratulated them on their flight which nearly had to be 
cut short one day because of an electricalsystem problem and 
said i am determined to go forward with an active space program 
when discovery commander michael l coats revealed that the crew 
was flying something for the new first lady it prompted a 
presidential invitation 
you better come up here and give it to her personally said 
bush youre invited when you get back head this way 
asked about a camera used to photograph environmental targets 
pilot john e blaha said the crew was getting a lot of great film 
that will show a lot of people around the world how fragile the 
planet earth is in this big vastness of space 
there is so much interest today on the global environment 
replied bush i think a lot of people will see from just your 
important mission the contribution that space exploration can make 
to the worlds environment 
discoverys crew started the day by preempting the usual wakeup 
call from mission control with tape recordings of their own they 
ended their eighthour sleep by radioing to earth the theme music 
from star trek 
then the recorded voice of william shatner who played capt 
kirk in star trek sent congratulations to mission control 
discovery responded a mission control communicator tell 
scotty to beam me up 
a rousing medley of school songs from the alma maters of the crew 
members was the official wake up sound from mission control 
the tape included anchors aweigh for naval academy graduates 
michael l coats james a buchli and robert c springer wild 
blue yonder for air force academy graduate john e blaha and the 
drexel university fight song for dr james p bagian a physican who 
earned a bachelors degree from the philadelphia school 
their fourth day in orbit was the first with a troublefree 
electrical power supply system on wednesday they followed special 
operating instructions from mission control to correct an erratic 
flow from a hydrogen tank that supplies reactant to chemical power 
generators on the shuttle 
flow from the tank became troublesome shortly after discovery was 
launched monday and mission control feared that fuel from the tank 
would not be available for use engineers asked the astronauts to 
dim lights and turn off computers and said the fiveday mission 
could be cut short a day if the problem wasnt corrected 
the fuel cells on the shuttle combine hydrogen and oxygen to make 
electricity and pure water 
discovery became an orbiting movie studio for part of today the 
astronauts were using a 70mm camera to take high fidelity pictures 
of environmental targets on earth for a joint project of the 
smithsonian institution and the national aeronautics and space 
administration 
photo targets included a coral reef being destroyed by pollution 
off east africa the scars left by fires in floridas everglades and 
the forests of the western united states areas of deforestation in 
south americas and an active volcano in guatamala 
we got plenty of shots of florida bagian reported and we 
got some very good pictures of hawaii 
the astronauts also aimed cameras at indonesian volcanos the 
great barrier reef off australia the andes mountains in south 
america the aswan dam in egypt and the baja california portion of 
mexico 
mission control remotely operated television cameras on discovery 
to capture startling views of lightning playing across the skies 
over south america and australia 
from the discoverys camera perch the lightning could be seen 
bursting like a string of flashing white lights on a christmas tree 
earlier studies from space have shown that lightning bolts seem to 
trigger each other in sequence along the front of a moving 
thunderstorm 
the astronauts also tended to their strange collection of 
orbiting companions four crippled rats 32 fertilized chicken eggs 
and a miniature plot of plants that are among the experiments 
aboard 
four caged rats with intentionally injured bones are being flown 
to test how weightlessness can affect healing 
the chicken eggs will be examined after discovery lands to 
determine how weightlessness affect the embryo development and a 
similar study is being made on the roots of a group of plants 
growing in a box on board 
the flight is the first of the year and nasa hopes to have six 
more as the agency builds toward a planned oneamonth flight rate 
within two years the mission is third since us flights resumed 
following the 1986 accident that destroyed space shuttle challenger 
and killed seven astronauts 
the astronauts accomplished the main goal on its first day of the 
flight deploying a 100 million communications satellite the 
satellite is in a high orbit where it completes a network nasa will 
use to link communications with shuttles and other satellites 
the mission is scheduled to end saturday at edwards air force 
base in california

trustees of howard university have expressed 
concern that the institutions administration may be incapable of 
resolving pressing problems and agreed to closely monitor top 
administrators it was reported today 
board members also told administrators wednesday they hold them 
responsible for student demonstrations at the predominantly black 
university that subsided only after the intervention of mayor marion 
barry jr and civil rights leader jesse jackson the washington post 
said 
john e jacob chairman of the board of trustees told reporters 
that in a board meeting with president james cheek and others we 
expressed our expectation that the administration will manage this 
institution as efficiently and effectively as possible and correct 
the inadequacies that exist the board wants to make sure we dont 
get a recurrence of the demonstrations in the future 
the poat quoted one unidentified trustee as saying there is a 
deep concern on the part of the trustees that our recent troubles 
are a result of the fact that there is no one at the helm we will 
be meeting over the next two to three months to determine if there 
is any way to address howards problems with the present 
leadership team 
roger d estep vice president for university relations who has 
been acting as spokesman for the administration said he could not 
comment on the criticisms raised about cheek or his deputies 
for more than three days last week 3000 students about 
onefourth of the student body occupied the howard administration 
building to protest the appointment of republican national chairman 
lee atwater to the board of trustees 
atwaters nomination while made by another trustee was 
wholeheartedly supported by cheek who has been president of the 
federally subsidized university since 1968 
students said atwaters management of president bushs election 
campaign had had racist overtones and that his appointment showed 
how insensitive university administrators are to their concerns 
they demanded and received atwaters resignation 
they also got assurances that the school would consider an 
africanamerican graduate studies program and work on severe 
housing inadequacies speedier processing of financial aid and 
security improvements

christians and moslems battled with 
artillery across beirut today and moslems staged a nationwide 
strike to mourn victims of the worst round of civil war fighting in 
four years 
police said moslem gunners fired rockets from west beiruts 
seaside zeitouni district into the christiancontrolled beirut port 
damaging installations but causing no casualties 
in retaliation christian batteries fired on the moslem 
residential districts of sabra and kasskass near beiruts dividing 
green line a police spokesman said there were no immediate reports 
of casualties according to the police spokesman who requested 
anonymity 
loudspeaker vans toured west beirut after the bombardment urging 
people to remain indoors 
sniper fire crackled in the old commercial district straddling 
the mediterranean harbor and around the christianheld town of souk 
elgharb southeast of the capital police said 
the two locations were the main battlefronts in the past eight 
days of fighting that left 49 people dead and 161 wounded by police 
count 
the clashes occurred between christian units of army commander 
gen michel aoun and syrianbacked militiamen of druse warlord walid 
jumblatts progressive socialist party 
the fighting began after aoun on march 6 imposed an airandsea 
blockade on illegal harbors run by moslem militias south of beirut 
in a bid to choke off their main source of revenue 
the blockade angered jumblatt whose party runs two illegal port 
facilities south of beirut and shiite moslem leader nabih berri 
whose amal militia operates one port in south beirut 
the militias use the ports to bring in weapons and supplies as 
well as imported goods sold in areas under their control as a 
result the state treasury loses an estimated 100 million a year in 
customs duties 
the oneday strike in west beirut and other moslem areas was 
called by jumblatt and his moslem and leftist allies in mourning 
for the victims of the massacre committed by gen aoun 
most casualties in the latest round of the 14yearold civil war 
were victims of a 24hour shelling duel in beirut on monday and 
tuesday 
schools shops cafes restaurants banks and other businesses 
were closed in west beirut in response to jumblatts call for a work 
stoppage 
the police spokesman said moslems in cities in north east and 
south lebanon also joined the strike 
aoun heads a christian military cabinet that has been vying for 
legitimacy with a rival moslem cabinet under acting prime minister 
salim hoss since president amin gemayels term ended sept 22 
minutes before stepping down gemayel named aoun to head an 
interim military cabinet but his appointment was rejected by 
leftists and moslems who declared allegiance to hoss 
aoun 53 accused syrian peacekeeping troops stationed in west 
beirut of causing the twoday bombardment 
he declared that his 20000 regular troops were involved in a 
war of liberation against syrian occupation forces 
the syrians with 40000 troops deployed in predominantly moslem 
sectors of the country are lebanons main power brokers and support 
hoss cabinet 
in syria the albaath daily newspaper which is controlled by 
president hafez assads ruling party denied aouns charges and said 
they were aimed at devastating syrias constructive role in 
lebanon

supreme court justice sandra day oconnor is 
being criticized for sending a letter used by conservative arizona 
republicans to support their claim that the united states is a 
christian nation 
arthur j kropp president of people for the american way said 
the letter has lent support to a movement that is a force for 
religious intolerance the liberal activist group supports strict 
separation of church and state 
oconnnor said in a brief statement wednesday that she was sorry 
the way her letter was used 
i regret that a letter i sent to an acquaintance in response to 
her request for information was used in a political debate said 
oconnor a former state legislator from arizona 
it was not my intention to express a personal view about the 
subject of the inquiry but merely to attempt to respond 
appropriately to one of the many requests for information which come 
across my desk 
she declined further comment 
oconnors may 19 1988 letter was sent to annetta conant author 
of a resolution characterizing the united states as a christian 
nation that was adopted last january by the arizona republican party 
the resolution is a rallying point for backers of the states 
former gop governor evan mecham who was removed from office last 
year moderate republicans and prominent jewish republicans in the 
state expressed dismay over the resolution 
oconnor said in her letter to ms conant you wrote me 
recently to inquire about any holdings of this court to the effect 
that this is a christian nation there are statements to such effect 
in the following opinions 
the letter cited three high court rulings in one handed down in 
1892 the court said we are a christian people and the morality 
of the country is deeply engrafted upon christianity 
but two more recent opinions do not refer to the united states a 
a christian nation in the pages cited by oconnor 
one opinion written by liberal justice william o douglas in 
1952 said we are a religious people whose institutions 
presuppose a supreme being we guarantee the freedom to worship as 
one chooses 
the other a concurring opinion by justice felix franfurter in 
1961 said religious beliefs in america shall continue to 
exist to function free of the dictates and directions of the 
state

r gene simmons is back on death row 
after a fellow inmate persuaded the us supreme court against 
simmons wishes to block his execution this morning for the slayings 
of 14 family members 
simmons 48 had been scheduled to die by injection five weeks 
after he was convicted of the 1987 christmastime killings he has 
said he wants to die and refused to appeal 
the order to stop the execution was issued wednesday without 
dissent or comment 
were disappointed because we know our client will be 
disappointed said simmons attorney john harris who had met with 
his client wednesday afternoon i personally felt that would be 
the last time i talked to him 
simmons who was eating his last meal when he saw a tv report 
about the stay merely asked if he could finish the meal 
jonas whitmore who is appealing his 1987 death penalty and 
conviction had filed the petition contending that simmons 
execution which would have been the first in arkansas in a 
quartercentury could have repercussions for other death row 
inmates 
arthur allen whitmores attorney said the us constitution 
requires an appeal in all death cases 
the state supreme court ruled friday that simmons is competent to 
waive his appeal for the february conviction the same court on 
monday rejected whitmores petition claiming he lacked legal 
standing whitmore filed the petition with justice harry blackmun on 
tuesday and blackmun referred it to the full court on wednesday 
reaction from state and local officials came swiftly 
the ruling came as a complete shock to me and i dont 
understand it gov bill clinton said wednesday 
very very surprised frustrated was state attorney general 
steve clarks response i actually didnt think the supreme court 
would issue a stay 
in russellville where simmons was arrested on dec 28 1987 
after killing two residents in a shooting rampage the opinion 
voiced against the supreme court ruling was stronger 
the decison stinks prosecutor john bynum said the supreme 
court has let jonas whitmore a convicted murderer manipulate the 
judicial system and its just not right 
after simmons was arrested in russellville authorities 
discovered the bodies of his wife seven children two of the 
childrens spouses and four grandchildren at his home near dover 
about 75 miles northwest of little rock 
bynum has prosecuted simmons twice winning a death sentence each 
time simmons was first sentenced to death last year for the 
russellville murders that execution was postponed by state and 
federal courts considering the validity of simmons waiver of his 
right to appeal 
clinton said wednesday he would now set a death date for simmons 
in the conviction for the russellville murders but clark said he 
would expect the supreme court to stay any execution date for 
simmons while it considers the whitmore petition 
the stay is of indefinite duration pending the filing of a 
petition to the court asking it to review simmons case if the 
petition is denied by the court at least four of the nine justices 
would have to vote to grant it the stay would be dissolved 
automatically and clinton could sign a death warrant for simmons for 
the family murders 
the arkansas democrat a little rock newspaper published a 
letter wednesday from simmons in which simmons called arkansas 
death penalty ineffective 
one of the things i wanted to say in court which would have 
answered one of your questions is that arkansas does not have a 
meaningful death penalty it is a facade simmons wrote in 
response to questions contained in a note given to him after a march 
9 federal court hearing

another frequency can expect the problem to persist through may 2 
the problem has been reported in concord orinda walnut creek 
lafayette moraga danville san ramon and livermore 
garage door openers operate on radio frequencies used by the

a soldier who was ordered to report to south 
korea and leave her infant daughter behind has won a delay of the 
transfer but said today she still wants out of the army 
it has nothing to do with going to south korea really spec 
4 cheryl beekman 21 said in an interview i have a hard time 
being in the military with a child 
ms beekman sued on tuesday seeking a discharge and an injunction 
blocking army orders that she report to south korea on march 23 ms 
beekman whose child is 6 months old was told no dependents were 
allowed on the assignment 
the army decided wednesday to halt her transfer pending the 
outcome of the federal court case said george solomon a spokesman 
for fort eustis in newport news where ms beekman is stationed 
if the court rules that everything that was done was legal 
then we have no alternative but to send her he said 
ms beekman a graphics illustrator joined the army for a 
fouryear hitch in 1986 when she became pregnant ms beekman was 
given the opportunity under military law to request a discharge but 
she turned one down 
however after she gave birth in september and her husband 
chris left virginia in october to take a job in tacoma wash she 
found the dual role of mother and soldier too much too handle she 
said in court papers 
i am just barely able to get myself up in the morning and am 
tired all day at work she said 
an army chaplain two comanding officers and an army staff judge 
supported ms beekmans request for a discharge to avert the 
transfer but col david a whaley her group commander overruled 
their recommendations 
her attorney kenneth e labowitz said he had found no previous 
cases in which a military woman has gone to court seeking a 
discharge so she could be with her child 
they have greatly liberalized the rules regarding women in the 
military generally he said but having opened up that 
situation that just creates new conflicts like this one

israeli troops today destroyed or sealed four 
homes owned by palestinians linked to a guerrilla group and 
reportedly opened fire on palestinian youths who threw stones in the 
occupied gaza strip 
throughout the narrow coastal strip palestinian youths burned 
tires raised outlawed palestinian flags and hurled rocks at troops 
who responded with gunfire arab reports said there were no reports 
of casualties 
protests by stonethrowing palestinian school children prompted 
israeli authorities to close two palestinian junior high schools in 
gaza city and the nearby village of bani suheila reports said 
palestinian witnesses said troops used dynamite to blow up two 
homes in the rimal and tufah neighborhoods of gaza city after 
imposing curfews and ordering family members to remove their 
belongings 
the homes were owned by two brothers who were arrested earlier 
this month for allegedly belonging to a guerrilla squad linked to 
plo chief yasser arafat the army said the squad is accused of 
killing two palestinians suspected of cooperating with israeli 
authorities 
this house belonged to my husbands 75yearold father nadia 
abukhari said my six children and i are now homeless 
troops also sealed the homes of two other alleged squad members 
the army said 
in the jabaliya refugee camp troops late wednesday bulldozed the 
home of a palestinian lawyer wanted by israeli authorities for 
allegedly heading jihad islami a fundamentalist moslem group backed 
by fatah the army said 
the timing of the demolition appeared linked to an attempted 
infiltration from egypt on wednesday by two palestinian teenagers 
who said they belonged to jihad islami and were operating with the 
backing of fatah 
since the december 1987 start of the uprising the army has 
destroyed or sealed nearly 200 houses belonging to palestinians 
suspected of antiisraeli violence usually the houses are 
demolished or sealed before a suspect stands trial the united 
states has condemned the practice saying it violates the right to 
due process before the law

britain secretly alerted airlines and airports 
about a possible terrorist attack two days before a bomb blew pan am 
flight 103 out of the sky over scotland the transport department 
has announced 
it said in a statement wednesday night the alert gave precise 
details of a new type of bomb hidden in a radiocassette player 
similar to the device that on dec 21 destroyed flight 103 killing 
all 259 people aboard the jumbo jet and 11 on the ground in 
lockerbie 
the alert was similar to an earlier warning sent out on nov 22 
but included a photo of the radiocassette player the department 
said later 
flight 103 originated in frankfurt west germany then changed 
planes at londons heathrow airport before heading for new york 
a radiocassette player containing plastic explosives and a 
device that could be set to detonate the bomb at a given altitude 
was found in october during raids by west german authorities in 
which 13 alleged members of the syrianbacked popular front for the 
liberation of palestinegeneral command guerrilla group were 
arrested 
pam hanlon a pan am spokeswoman in new york said today there 
is indeed a memo dated dec 19 but we did not receive it until jan 
17 i am not going to say more than that she said she did not 
have the memo in front of her so she would not talk about what it 
contained 
trans world airlines was advised by the us federal aviation 
administration on nov 18 of a bomb device found in germany and was 
told the same thing by the british department of transport on jan 
16 said charles adams a senior vice president of twas 
international division 
adams today said in london that people are reading an awful lot 
of things into the fact that some airlines received the 
information from the departnent of transport on jan 16 we had 
received the same information from the faa a month earlier he 
said 
a british airways spokesman said the airline received a telex on 
nov 22 the day it was sent but refused to go into details of 
what it said he also said the airline received an alert on dec 19 
we had full details which we passed onto security staff he 
said he declined to be named 
lawmaker john prescott the opposition labor partys spokesman on 
transport accused the government of mounting what can only be a 
coverup 
two americans who lost family members aboard flight 103 today 
said the plane should have been searched for a bomb before it left 
for new york 
the transport department said the alert from its principal 
aviation security adviser jim jack followed an initial warning in 
november of a possible bombing 
it said the barometric timing device indicated it was intended 
to sabotage an aircraft we sent advice to the relevant security 
authorities they were told what to look for the american 
authorities would have done the same for american airlines 
asked why transport secretary paul channon had not mentioned the 
dec 19 warning after the bombing a department spokesman who in 
accordance with british practice declined to be further identified 
said these are things that mr channon may want to answer on in 
due course 
he said an initial warning was sent on nov 22 or 17 days before 
a dec 9 warning by us intelligence sources that a group planned 
to bomb a pan am jet from frankfurt within two weeks 
the spokesman said some members of the group arrested in germany 
were still being detained while investigations continued into the 
lockerbie bombing 
the case of the terrorist group in frankfurt is being looked at 
in relation to lockerbie he said 
the london tabloid the daily mirror today called the latest 
disclosure a huge embarrassment to channon and prime minister 
margaret thatcher who have come under pressure from anguished 
relatives and members of parliament to disclose how much the 
government knew 
raymond germain a staten island ny man whose 20yearold 
daughter kathleen was killed aboard the plane said the plane should 
have been searched for a bomb 
its unconscionable this plane should have never left the 
ground until it was thoroughly checked he said in an telephone 
interview 
geraldine buser of glen rock nj told wcbs radio how the 
hell am i supposed to feel if they knew this the bomb was going to 
be there 
ms buser who lost her husband warren son michael and 
daughter lorraine howe said if its going to save a planeload of 
people and you have a report that this thing might happen its 
worth waiting two hours

nasa said today the two solid fuel 
booster rockets that helped thrust space shuttle discovery into 
orbit appeared to be in good condition as engineers began a detailed 
inspection 
the 149foot rockets parachuted into the atlantic ocean 150 miles 
offshore on monday and were brought to shore by two recovery ships 
flight data and a look at the motors showed the rockets performed 
well during mondays launch and did not have any cork insulation 
loss like that suspected of damaging shuttle tiles on the last 
mission in december 
the rockets were redesigned because a joint in one allowed flame 
to escape and touched off the chalenger explosion that killed seven 
astronauts on jan 28 1986 
royce mitchell project manager of the booster rocket program at 
nasas marshall space flight center in alabama said discoverys 
boosters burned just 14 seconds longer than predicted during the 
two minutes their motors were firing 
were very pleased with that kind of performance he said 
the twin boosters made up the third set of redesigned rockets 
nasa has flown since returning the shuttle to flight in september

the american flag made its final appearance on the 
floor at a student art exhibit today with three ledgers offering a 
handwritten history of the rage pain sympathy and support that the 
work provoked 
the stage for the four weeks of heated debate was set by 
dread scott tyler 24 with his work what is the proper way to 
display the us flag 
since the show opened at the school of the art institute the 
work has triggered demonstrations debate on capitol hill censure 
by the state house submission of tough new flagprotection 
legislation in the state senate and a lawsuit seeking the flags 
removal that was promptly dismissed by a judge 
the exhibit opened this morning without incident said school 
spokeswoman beth sullivan we expect it to be pretty quiet 
today she said 
president bush said wednesday that he thought the 
flagonthefloor exhibit is disgraceful but added that he would 
be very wary of proposed legislation that would jail anyone for 
setting up such a display 
im always worried about the right of free speech bush said 
in an oval office interview with the chicago suntimes and five 
other newspapers 
bush said he was disgusted by the exhibit because theres a 
certain respect for the flag that american people have 
the controversy is all there in the ledgers that are part of the 
work anger and pain from veterans comment on first amendment 
rights opinions about tylers use of the flag as a powerful symbol 
and more 
the authors number in the hundreds with myriad viewpoints 
a sampling 
a cheap publicity stunt not art its sad you had to desecrate 
our flag to achieve recognition 
well scott you got what you wanted 
you should be put on the floor and walked on 
good work at provoking a reaction thats what art is supposed 
to do 
dude you think this is cool well its not 
this took guts if you believe in what you did good for you 
if you dont like this country move to a communist one 
you skunk my fathers flag was drapped sic over his coffin 
 
i think this is a lot of fuss over nothing 
becky call ed 
one visitor congratulated tyler on enlisting viewers to complete 
the piece with their comments living history 
another bemoaned the myopia of visitors who neglect all the 
art that surrounds them at the juried exhibit which featured 66 
minoritystudent works mostly paintings 
viewers wednesday were admitted in small groups for security 
reasons and allowed about 10 minutes at the schools public gallery 
many returned to the short line for another look 
security guards sighed with relief at the prospect of an end to 
the exhibit that drew hostile visitors and even threats 
and in front of the art institute a downtown showcase a handful 
of protesters proudly waved american flags 
tyler intended the flag to be spread on the floor beneath a 
framed blackandwhite montage featuring flagdraped coffins and 
third world antiamerican protest and the shelf containing the 
ledgers 
protesters contend the arrangement invites visitors to walk on 
the flag a claim disputed by school officials 
tyler has called his work revolutionary and says he had no 
apologies despite death threats he said he and his mother have 
received 
the bad news is that the flag doesnt mean to the scott tylers 
of this country what it means to so many of us robert mars art 
institute vice president for administration said earlier this week 
the good news is that our system worked the student was allowed 
to make his statement

chinas policy of one child per couple and 
restrictions on early marriages are being widely ignored according 
to a state planning commission survey released thursday 
results of the survey said that since the onechild policy was 
started in 1980 about 9 million babies a year have been born 
outside the state plan 
family planning commission head peng peiyun said the survey was 
an alarm bell she said the average chinese couple between 1980 
and 1987 had 247 children 
last year there were approximately 23 million births and 7 
million deaths in china pushing the nations population close to 
11 billion 
the twoyear survey which covered 2 million people found that 
women bearing two or more children accounted for 40 percent of the 
unauthorized births about onefifth of the unauthorized births were 
to women under 20 which is the legal age for women in china to 
marry the peoples daily said in reporting results of the survey 
the survey found that less than 60 percent of women of 
childbearing age practice birth control 
the government has had substantial success in limiting family 
sizes in cities but has met strong resistance in the countryside 
rural couples wanting boys in particular to help in the fields and 
to care for them when they become old have been willing to pay 
steep fines for violating the onechild policy 
the government has acknowledged that its target of limiting 
population to 12 billion in the year 2000 is not possible 
estimates for the number of chinese at the turn of the century have 
jumped to 13 billion about 20 percent of total world population

a senate committee today approved legislation 
to open the arctic national wildlife refuge to oil exploration 
rejecting an amendment to delay it until a national energy plan is 
developed 
the senate committee on energy and natural resources adopted a 
proposal by sen mark hatfield rore that would allow drilling 
while a study on energy conservation is under way 
an amendment to the bill that would have delayed any drilling 
until the interior secretary presented congress with a comprehensive 
energy plan was defeated on a 127 vote 
committee chairman bennett johnston dla called the amendment 
offered by sens timothy wirth dcolo and dale bumpers dark a 
killer amendment that would effectively stop any oil drilling in 
the refuge 
we have been studying energy policy in this committee for 17 
years johnston said more conservation is needed he said but in 
the meantime more domestic oil production must begin 
estimates as to the amount of oil that may be found in the refuge 
vary with the minimum put at 32 billion barrels 
the bill which pits conservationists against development 
interests now goes to the senate floor for a vote it has not been 
taken up by the house 
the measure was introduced last session but failed to get a vote 
on the floor of either the house or senate 
on wednesday the committee refused to tie a requirement that 
cars be more fuel efficient to the drilling legislation 
that amendment offered by sen howard metzenbaum dohio said 
american cars would have to get an average 34 miles to the gallon by 
the year 2000 or the manufacturer would be penalized 
we would get more oil from the metzenbaum amendment than we 
would from anwr the wildlife refuge said wirth 
bumpers said he might be persuaded to vote in favor of searching 
for oil in the refuge but it doesnt make sense to use it in gas 
guzzlers 
he said americans have gotten fat and happy are buying big 
cars and are not serious about dealing with an energy crisis that 
is coming just as certainly as god made little green apples 
in opposing the amendment sen frank murkowski ralaska said 
the committee did not have jurisdiction over auto mileage and that 
it should go through the commerce committee 
he said as much as 9 billion barrels of oil might be found in the 
refuge lessening us dependence on imported fuel 
other estimates have put the expected production to be about 4 
billion barrels the refuge which is just east of prudhoe bay is 
the breeding ground for one of north americas largest remaining 
herds of migratory caribou and the home of wildlife such as polar 
bear musk oxen wolves arctic foxes waterfowl and fish 
sen don nickles rokla said the metzenbaum amendment could 
raise the cost of automobiles and cause layoffs in the industry it 
was defeated on a 99 vote

commuters jammed buses and taxis and 
clashes broke out in at least one subway station thursday after 
thousands of city subway workers went on strike to demand the 
systems president resign 
subway president kim myongnong ordered strikers to return to 
work by early friday or face disciplinary action union officials 
refused 
subway officials said about 6000 of the systems 7732 employees 
participated in the strike the first extended work stoppage in the 
seoul subway corps 15year history more than 2300 strikers were 
arrested 
a sudden snowstorm that hit seoul during the morning added to 
congestion and confusion in city streets clogged with heavy traffic 
the 3 million people who use the subway daily in this city of 
about 10 million struggled to find alternate transportation buses 
were packed with riders and taxis carried up to five passengers 
union leaders who spoke on condition of anonymity said they would 
stay on strike until their demands for kims resignation were met 
and all arrested strikers were released and charges dropped 
union leaders accuse kim of acting in bad faith during labor 
negotiations last week the talks resulted in an agreement on new 
pay and working conditions but strikers said they do not trust the 
subway corporation to live up to the deal 
strikers also demanded withdrawal of lawsuits against labor 
leaders who organized protests last week in which subway workers 
allowed commuters to ride free 
the strike will probably continue for a few days as police have 
detained thousands of protesters and most union members are ready to 
resist the governments stern measures one union official said 
about 4000 riot police raided a subway depot in eastern seoul to 
disperse 3000 strikers who had seized the facility overnight and 
erected barricades armored trucks fired tear gas and bulldozers 
removed the barricades 
some strikers hurled firebombs and rocks at riot police but they 
were overpowered in less than 30 minutes police said 2344 strikers 
were arrested at the depot 
police said most of those arrested would be released by friday 
but that 30 would be charged with organizing an illegal strike 
the government mobilized more than 10000 extra buses trucks and 
cars to provide emergency service government workers were 
instructed to report to work one hour late and school pupils one 
hour early to help reduce traffic 
limited service was provided on some subway lines by managers 
nonstriking workers and drivers drafted from the national railroad 
system subway officials said 
the officials reported that the citys four subway lines operated 
at 54 percent of their capacity 
mayor koh kun apologized to commuters for the inconvenience we 
want the strikers to return to work and drop their unjust demands 
he said 
the strikers have demanded that koh sign the new labor agreement 
but koh said he could not do that because he did not represent the 
corporation 
the only previous strike by subway workers was a twohour 
stoppage in june 1988

rep jerry lewis rcalif today formally took 
himself out of the race for the no 2 leadership job among house 
republicans but another gop member vowed to nominate rep henry 
hyde of illinois for the job and make it a threeway contest 
lewis who as chairman of the house republican conference now 
holds the thirdranking job in the gop hierarchy made no formal 
endorsement when he announced his decision at a news conference 
but he described the job of republican whip which is being 
vacated by rep dick cheney so he can become president bushs 
secretary of defense as one that demands an ability to reach out to 
republicans of all ideologies and to democrats as well 
that description seemed to point to rep edward madigan rill 
the current deputy whip and longtime inside legislative tactician 
who is running for the job with the quiet support of minority leader 
robert michel 
lewis characterized the other candidate rep newt gingrich of 
georgia as a talented and energetic lawmaker but one whose talents 
might be best suited to helping run the gop political campaign 
apparatus 
at the end of lewis news conference rep gerald solomon rny 
made a surprise appearance to tell reporters that he would nominate 
hyde a conservative house veteran for the post whether some like 
it or not 
hyde had decided a day earlier not to make the race but solomon 
said that decision was the result of pressure from the illinois 
delegation which didnt want madigans support to be diluted 
solomon said hyde should be the heirapparent to michel who is 
expected to retire in the next few years and should therefore be 
installed now as whip 
both gingrich and madigan who have been soliciting support since 
cheney was nominated last friday claimed to have majority support 
among the 174member house republican conference 
the contest was seen largely as one of style and to some extent 
one of generations and ideology 
gingrich a sixterm lawmaker best known for his attacks on house 
speaker jim wright dtexas was generally favored by conservative 
colleagues who believe the partys current leadership is too 
unwilling to do highprofile warfare with the ruling democrats 
madigan was seen by many as someone who has paid his dues as the 
senior republican on the house agriculture committee and as an 
inside player on various gop legislative initiatives 
leadership sources said soon after madigan announced last friday 
that he planned to make the whips race michel voiced his support 
and has been quietly campaigning for his illinois colleague who is 
closer to his style

scientists have discovered a series of unknown 
earthquake faults thanks to pictures from a satellite that has been 
facing the budget ax 
the faults are located in the central and eastern parts of 
californias mojave desert and were found using images taken by the 
landsat satellite according to the national aeronautics and space 
administration 
the faults were discovered by studying a series of images taken 
in differing optical and infrared spectra according to scientists 
at nasas jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena calif and at 
louisiana state university 
some of the faults are inactive but others may still be 
seismically active the scientists said the faults form part of a 
complex fault region between death valley and the san andreas fault 
region 
without the landsat images the faults would not have been 
discovered said john ford of nasa 
his announcement was made even as scientists and politicians were 
struggling over financing to keep the landsat system going 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration announced 
recently that it would have to shut down the landsat system at the 
end of this month because of a lack of money to operate it 
subsequently vice president dan quayle began encouraging other 
government agencies to chip in funds to keep the system going and 
the cutoff has at least been delayed 
landsat which studies the earths surface for mapping mineral 
studies and other research still faces a tenuous financual future

tibetans spiritual leader the dalai 
lama said thursday he believes beijing is ready for negotiations 
that would grant greater freedom to his people and the land he fled 
30 years ago 
in an interview at his exile headquarters in the remote himalayan 
foothills of north india the dalai lama admitted he has had no 
recent indication of this from chinese authorities 
in fact the tibetan capital of lhasa has been under martial law 
since bloody antichinese protests there last week 
but the dalai lama adhered to his belief that change is sweeping 
china that the new concept of reform in the soviet union will soon 
come to the worlds other major communist power 
within a few months talks may start the dalai lama said 
in the meantime he said he will continue to support nonviolent 
protest in tibet 
peaceful demonstrations that i am supporting that is the 
only way to make our situation known to the outside world the 
dalai lama said 
tibetans should not indulge in damaging and burning property 
they should not indulge in stoning even if the chinese open fire 
they should not retaliate he said 
the dalai lama spoke at midafternoon in the hilltop compound that 
houses his residence offices thekchen choeling temple and namgyal 
monastery where maroonrobed monks debate ancient scriptures and 
venerate this bespectacled 54yearold farmers son as a living 
godking the 14th reincarnation of the earthly manifestation of 
buddha 
on another march 16 afternoon exactly 30 years ago the dalai 
lama was in a more remote and far grander himalayan compound in 
lhasa surrounded by chinese troops who had moved their artillery 
within range of his palace the dalai lama and his advisers were at 
the brink of the decision that would propel him and eventually 
110600 other tibetans into exile 
by the night of march 17 he had slipped out of lhasas 
norbulinka palace disguised as a tibetan soldier and shouldering a 
rifle by april 18 1959 he was safe in india free to speak 
against china 
but the tibetans uprising had failed the chinese guns had 
bombarded norbulinka and thousands of tibetans were dead 
it was the approach of this anniversary that resulted in more 
bloodshed in lhasa last week 
by official count 16 people were killed when police opened fire 
during a proindependence demonstration in lhasa in which 
chineseowned shops and vehicles were set afire western travelers 
said as many as 20 or 30 were killed 
chinas subsequent ban on foreigners entering tibet makes it 
impossible for the outside world to know with any certainty what is 
happening in the ancient kingdom which chinese troops entered in 
1950 
beijing maintains tibet has traditionally been part of china the 
dalai lama and his government in exile say tibet has been 
independent for centuries 
in the last few days you see a sad situation within tibet 
the dalai lama said a long shawl of finely spun wool protecting him 
from the mountain chill 
in the last 30 years they the chinese have used every 
repression he said speaking in english we lost everything in 
the last 30 years but we still remain we are the same tibetans the 
chinese bullied 30 years ago 
despite the imposition of martial law the dalai lama said he 
thought chinas eagerness to open its economy to the outside world 
would bring greater awareness and greater tolerance to political 
problems at home 
reflecting a sense that time may be running out that an influx 
of chinese settlers in tibet would obliterate the separate tibetan 
identity the dalai lama last june made his biggest concession to 
date 
he proposed his homeland become a selfgoverning democratic 
political entity in association with china 
in return he said china could retain troops on tibetan soil and 
handle tibets foreign policy 
china rejected the proposal saying it failed to relinquish the 
concept of tibetan independence but it said it was willing to talk 
to the dalai lama 
the dalai lama on thursday repeated that talks should start at a 
lower level in a neutral spot outside chinese control 
if the chinese do not want to talk ok the last 30 years we 
spent like this he said

the worlds land areas have become wetter over 
the last century or so but the rainfall increases have skipped 
large areas of the planet according to a study released thursday 
south america and australia have seen measurable increases in 
precipitation since the late 1800s the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration reported 
at the same time however there has been a decline in africa and 
in tropical areas of the northern hemisphere 
the analysis of rainfall patterns was compiled by noaas henry f 
diaz rs bradley of the university of massachusetts and jon 
eischeid of the university of colorado their findings are to be 
published in an upcoming issue of the journal of geophysical 
research 
the scientists looked at nearly a century of records diaz said 
the primary period of increasing rainfall in the southern hemisphere 
was from the 1940s to the mid1950 
in the northern hemisphere the overall trend is almost 
unchanged he said noting however that there seems to have been a 
decline in rainfall in northern tropical areas in the last 15 years 
or so 
rainfall patterns show substantial variability from time to time 
the scientists noted changing over periods of a decade or more 
thus they said it is difficult to determine whether rainfall 
has been affected by longterm phenomena such as that embodied in 
the greenhouse theory which predicts that changes in the atmosphere 
will cause worldwide temperatures to warm leading to changes in 
rainfall and other climate phenomena

dick cheney the wyoming congressman about to 
become secretary of defense is tackling one of the most difficult 
management jobs in government with only an outsiders knowledge of 
modern weapons and with the extra weight of a late start 
all the problems are compounded for cheney says caspar w 
weinberger who served almost seven years in the job 
two months have gone by a great many trains are leaving the 
station and they all have to be caught at once weinberger said in 
an interview thursday 
hes a fine choice and he will be very good but he faces a 
very daunting task 
other officials still inside the pentagon who asked not to be 
named say its possible for a congressman to jump into the huge 
military bureaucracy and shine 
for example one said melvin laird did well in the nixon 
administration and cheney who like laird held a leadership post 
among house republicans is no stranger to most of the big issues 
the official added 
but cheney is about to leap from running a capitol hill office 
with relatively few employees to becoming the boss of 31 million 
people and he is doing so with little time to select key assistants 
and aides 
the first important job hell face is trimming the fiscal 1990 
budget and hes never played that peculiar brand of pentagon 
politics 
dick cheney is about to walk into this job right when its time 
to play referee among four services that are attacking each other in 
hopes of saving their own budget said one official 
president bush already has ordered the pentagon to slash about 
64 billion from its fiscal 1990 budget proposal and now its 
dogeatcat time the source said 
weinberger recalled such military budget fights saying 
everybody has recommendations of their own their own hopes and 
needs and theres never enough for everybody it will be very 
very tough for cheney 
to make matters worse the congressman doesnt have the detailed 
militaryprogram knowledge possessed by bushs first choice for the 
job john tower 
tower a former chairman of the senate armed services committee 
was widely known for his exhaustive knowledge of such details his 
personal life however including allegations of excessive drinking 
and womanizing and his financial relationships with military 
contractors led to rejection of his nomination last week 
cheney by contrast after being lauded for his honor and 
integrity was approved 200 thursday by the armed services 
committee and is expected to clear the full senate without 
opposition friday 
one pentagon official said anyone who sets his mind to it can 
learn what weapons the nation depends on how they work how theyre 
produced and how much they cost 
but that takes time and cheney doesnt have any he said 
tower knew the inside politics the games between the services 
and program quirks another source said 
as if setting budget priorities were not enough cheney also will 
have only about a month to help bush make broad decisions that will 
affect national security for years to come 
for example the administration must decide whether the united 
states needs a mobile nuclear missile to deter soviet attack and if 
so what type and how large it should be the administration also 
must decide how fast it will attempt to build b2 stealth bombers 
a decision with huge financial implications 
other pending decisions include how vigorously to develop a 
star wars antimissile defense system whether to continue 
supporting a navy built around 15 aircraft carriers whether 
military manpower should be cut what goals to aim for in 
negotiating a nuclear arms treaty with the soviet union and how to 
walk the tightrope of safeguarding europe while negotiating 
reductions to conventional arms 
hes going to have to do about 14 or 15 things at once says 
weinberger who was sworn in as secretary of defense just one day 
after ronald reagan began his presidency 
its too bad he lost these months

blacks die more often as infants and have 
shorter harsher lives if they survive they have more trouble 
getting jobs are more likely to be poor and suffer more violent 
crime and divorces 
in an america that is far from colorblind the quality of black 
life from cradle to grave is worse than it is for whites and the 
gaps are widening in some areas according to recent studies 
there are still deep inequalities between the races said 
billy tidwell director of research for the national urban league in 
washington the nation cannot allow such a significant part of its 
citizenry to experience such disadvantages 
a black child born in 1986 can expect to die six years sooner 
than a white child according to a report released wednesday by the 
us department of health and human services 
life expectancy among whites rose from 753 years to 754 years 
between 1984 and 1986 for blacks the number dropped from 697 to 
694 
among the culprits that shorten black lives are infant mortality 
murders aids and pneumonia 
of 1000 black babies born in 1984 184 died before they were a 
year old the mortality rate for white babies was 94 per 1000 
births according to the national centers for disease control 
low birth weight and lack of proper medical care were the main 
causes of death the cdc said a black baby is three times more 
likely than a white one to be born to a mother who had no prenatal 
care according to a 1989 study by the urban league 
in 1986 there were 22000 murders almost half the victims were 
black and the murder rate is almost six times higher for blacks 
than whites black males are nearly as likely to be murdered as they 
are to die in a car accident the government said 
blacks make up 12 percent of the population but are twice as 
likely to get aids 
influenza and pneunomia caused 28 of each 100000 deaths among 
black men far higher than the 18 per 100000 rate posted for white 
men 
other studies show disproportionate differences between the races 
the poverty rate for blacks in 1986 was 311 percent compared 
with the 11 percent rate for whites the us census bureau said 
the black rate is worse than the 1969 figure of 28 percent 
the jobless rate among blacks in 1987 was 13 percent 25 times 
the 53 percent rate for whites if agencies counted blacks who were 
so discouraged they have quit looking for work the rate would 
approach 25 percent according to the national committee for full 
employment 
the median black family income was 17604 compared with 30809 
for whites according to the urban league that same year 442 
percent of black families had incomes of less than 10000 more 
than triple the rate for whites 
in black families single women are more apt to be in charge 
black males have the highest death rates from accidents and 
violence of any ethnic group with 153 per 100000 the white rate is 
986 per 100000 according to a 1984 urban league report 
the divorce rate among blacks jumped from 45 per 1000 marriages 
in 1960 to 178 per 1000 marriages in 1981 white couples divorced 
at the rate of 27 per 1000 in 1960 and 82 per 1000 in 1981 the 
report said 
black males run a deadly gauntlet of dangers that cause a 
steady attrition in the number of men who can support families 
said james mcghee an urban league researcher 
according to the 1980 census report elderly blacks were 35 
times as likely as older whites to live in dwellings without 
plumbing about 44 percent of homes occupied by blacks lacked 
central heating 
in 1985 elderly nonwhites mostly blacks were five times as 
likely to be slaying victims than whites and nonwhite males were 
27 times more likely to be robbery victims than elderly white 
males according to the national caucus and center on black aged 
black males had the greatest slippage in college enrollment among 
any racial or ethnic group over the past decade according to a 
study in january by the american council on education enrollment 
dropped from 43 percent in 1976 to 35 percent by 1986 
blacks also earned the fewest degrees and made the least progress 
in number of faculty positions held 
those who do manage to attend college find considerable racism 
and chilly environments on many white campuses said the report by 
deborah j carter and reginald wilson 
fair housing is also a challenge according to a february study 
in social science quarterly 
an asian or hispanic who has finished thirdgrade has a higher 
probability of living in an integrated neighborhood than a black 
with a doctorate the study said and an asian or hispanic who makes 
less than 2500 a year has a higher chance of living in an 
integrated neighborhood than a black who earns more than 50000 
blacks are exposed to higher crime rates less effective 
educational systems higher mortality risks more dilapidated 
surroundings and a poorer socioeconomic environment than whites 
said researcher nancy denton of the university of chicago 
integration is possible even likely for all ethnic and racial 
groups except blacks

an american soldier has been 
charged with espionage for allegedly handing over us defense 
secrets to communist east germany the army announced today 
american military authorities said they filed the charges against 
spec 4 michael a peri who recently disappeared for 11 days near 
the east german border he turned himself in to military authorities 
last week 
he also brought back a laptop computer he took from his unit 
where he worked as an electronics warfare signal specialist 
officials have said 
one army officer told the associated press the east germans 
notified us officials that peri had contacted them but it was not 
immediately clear why the communist country would have done that 
in a statement sent to the news media the us army said peri 
has been charged with espionage communicating documents andor 
information relating to national defense to the german democratic 
republic gdr 
the statement said peri was charged with moving classified 
documents to the gdr and transferring classified information to 
unauthorized persons 
it provided no further details about the information allegedly 
handed over to the east germans and said no date has been set for 
the soldiers trial 
a 5th corps spokesman lt col jake dye told the associated 
press he gave them information were just not in a position to 
say what it was 
a deputy spokesman maj samuel taylor said in an interview 
it is us national defense information as far as it pertains to 
our nato mission and to the general defense plan as a nato force 
taylor said that the evidence we have that he crossed the 
border was given to us by the gdr ministry of foreign affairs he 
said we were told by the east german ministry peri made contact 
with them 
peri disappeared feb 21 from the 11th armored cavalry regiment 
in fulda 65 miles northeast of frankfurt 
some officials speculated that he defected because a military 
vehicle he signed out was found feb 23 near the town of obersuhl a 
remote rural area northeast of fulda and near the east german border 
us officials said peri worked as an electronics warfare signal 
specialist he was responsible for operating equipment that detects 
enemy radar and other signals he has been stationed in west germany 
since march 1988 
the army communique said peri also was charged with failure to 
obey the lawful regulations that require him to get permission to 
travel to the german democratic republic the regulations also 
require soldiers to check with their security officer before going 
into a communistcontrolled country 
the statement did not say where peri went inside east germany or 
how he crossed the heavily guarded border 
peri who was being held in pretrial confinement in mannheim 
west germany already has been charged with being absent without 
leave and other offenses 
the 21yearold soldier comes from laguna niguel calif 
before todays announcement army officials described peri as a 
good cleancut soldier who had a perfect record 
in fact he had been promoted and nominated for soldier of the 
month twice in the year he has been here an army spokesman lt 
col jake dye said earlier this month thats what makes it so 
baffling 
officials who thought peri had defected recalled that in march 
1987 us army pvt wade e roberts 22 of riverside calif 
defected with his west german girlfriend to the soviet union 
roberts returned to the united states in november 1987 and was 
courtmartialed as a deserter he was given a bad conduct discharge 
after being found guilty of the lesser charge of being absent 
without leave

authorities arrested three town 
magistrates and suspended two asuncion police officers accused of 
torturing prisoners during the dictatorship of gen alfredo 
stroessner officials said thursday 
the arrests and suspensions are part of a campaign launched by 
gen andres rodriguez who toppled stroessner in a feb 3 coup 
the magistrates who have executive and judicial powers akin to 
those of a mayor or justice of the peace were accused in the 1979 
deaths of 24yearold adolfo irala and his brothers victor 19 and 
sindulfo 27 they died in tebicuarymi a town 80 miles southeast of 
asuncion 
the mother of the three leonora irala told human rights lawyers 
her sons were tortured by electric shock and had their teeth pulled 
out with pliers 
my sons cries and screams for help could be heard in the whole 
town mrs irala was quoted as telling the asuncion newspaper el 
diario 
she said her sons were detained and tortured for five days in 
connection with the slaying of the son of the local ward president 
of the ruling colorado party 
formal charges have not been filed against tebicuarymi 
magistrates elvio reyes ruben fernandez and salustiano gimenez 
authorities said 
police announced the suspension of asuncion officers augusto 
caceres spelt and camilo almada saprissa who have been accused of 
torture during the stroessner regime 
lawyers for human rights organizations said dozens of formal 
complaints were filed against those two and others but never were 
acted upon 
i know of at least 100 different suits against almada saprissa 
for torture said francisco vargas a human rights lawyer for the 
committee of churches 
interior ministry spokesman artemio nunez said they will be 
given the opportunity to defend themselves 
we cant be unjust even with those who are unjust with us he 
added 
the campaign against torture began a month ago when interior 
minister orlando machuca vargas pledged to eliminate torture 
chambers in police stations and urged citizens who had been tortured 
to file legal complaints 
stroessner ruled paraguay 34 years before being overthrown in a 
bloody coup by rodriguez who had been his secondincommand in the 
army stroessner was accused of brutal repression of opponents 
during his rule and the reagan administration in 1976 labeled his 
government a dictatorship 
he has lived in brazil since the coup

the us government joined friends and 
relatives of terry anderson today in urging the journalists captors 
in lebanon to release him immediately on his fourth anniversary as a 
hostage 
the continued detention of anderson and other hostages in lebanon 
is a criminal act which serves no cause state department 
spokesman charles redman said in a statement 
the hostageholders should release their captives immediately 
and unconditionally and we call on all countries with influence 
over the hostages such as iran to use that influence to obtain 
freedom for all the hostages redman said 
president bush certainly is concerned about the hostages 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said in houston where bush 
was making a speech he said the united states will continues 
efforts to seek the release of anderson and eight other american 
hostages 
at a ceremony on capitol hill marking andersons fourth year as a 
captive his sister peggy say of cadiz ky said anderson a 
correspondent for the associated press is frustrated tired and 
lonely and tired of being caged like an animal 
in a message transmitted to the news agencys staff ap president 
louis d boccardi said our hearts cry out in protest over 
andersons plight 
its time for those holding terry anderson to release him and 
to end the unconscionable suffering of an innocent man each of us 
in our own special way should mark this day with contemplation and 
prayer for terrys release boccardi continued 
as has been true from the beginning on that saturday morning in 
1985 our efforts on his behalf will continue in all corners of the 
world until our brave friend is free once more 
tom brokaw of nbc news who moderated an hourlong ceremony in a 
house office building said anderson has not been forgotten as he 
enters his fifth year as a captive in a small dingy room 
we cant turn our backs when people are denied human rights 
brokaw said 
the rev lawrence martin jenco a former hostage held for a time 
with anderson said that before his release on july 26 1986 he 
promiseed the journalist that i would never forget him that 
others would never forget him 
colleagues who knew and worked with anderson one of nine 
american hostages held in lebanon talked of his dedication to his 
job and his desire to tell the story of the wartorn nation 
he took big risks and he has paid an awful price these last 
four years said david ignatius an associate editor of the 
washington post i want to see terry released tomorrow if 
possible 
thomas friedman diplomatic correspondent for the new york times 
said the radical moslem shiites believed to hold anderson are 
damaging islams image by keeping hostages the only way your 
story is ever going to be told again is if our comrades are free 
he said 
bruce laingen a former hostage in iran echoed that thought the 
hostageholders are doing a grievous disservice to islam he 
said at the event which was cosponsored by no greater love a 
humanitarian organization and the journalists committee to free 
terry anderson 
sen daniel p moynihan dny a member of the senate foreign 
relations committee attended the ceremony as did reps cliff 
stearns rfla nick joe rahall dwva and thomas foglietta 
dpa also in attendance were lebanese ambassador abdallah bouhabib 
and peter burleigh deputy assistant secretary of state for near 
east affairs 
on wednesday moynihan said he would not accept the explanation 
that nothing can be done he was to introduce a resolution today 
in the senate condemning hostagetaking something must be done 
the executive branch must seek to use every avenue formal and 
informal to win the hostages freedom moynihan said in a 
statement 
meantime administration officials say there has been no change 
in the hostage policy since president bush assumed office nearly two 
months ago 
in terms of our policy there has been no change and i dont 
foresee one said a state department mideast specialist speaking 
on condition of anonymity he called the policy the only one that 
might work 
since the reagan administration was embarrassed in november 1986 
by revelations it had sold weapons to iran the us policy has 
been no concessions but were willing to talk to anyone 
another official said 
but say has been critical of us government efforts on behalf of 
the hostages 
you want to hope they are working on it but lets face it 
four years speaks for itself she said say said she does not 
think the bush administration has made any new drives to free the 
hostages basically things are just status quo 
she listed specific initiatives the united states could pursue 
including payments to the families of iranians killed last july when 
the uss vincennes shot down an iranian jetliner in the persian gulf 
the state department said it is working on a payment plan 
you begin to wonder what it takes to move people mrs say 
said they have heard and read how hostages have died how they 
have gone mad how they exist from daytoday in the most barbaric 
conditions and the world does not respond 
officials say different factions hold the nine american hostages 
who have been seized in lebanon but they are elements of the 
umbrella group hezbollah over which iran exhibits control the 
united states has called for the unconditional release of all 
hostages before it will talk with iran 
the families frustration follows a brief sense of optimism that 
followed bushs jan 20 inaugural address in which he repeated his 
opposition to any deals but seemed to send a signal to the captors 
there are today americans who are held against their will in 
foreign lands and americans who are unaccounted for bush said 
assistance can be show here and will be long remembered good 
will begets good will 
since then other developments have intervened most recently the 
furor over the satanic verses a book by salman rushdie that 
moslems consider to be blasphemous the iranian government has 
called for rushdies death 
the situation has fallen apart again mrs say said 
mammod faksh a professor of middle eastern studies at the 
university of southern maine said he doesnt expect any good news 
for the hostages soon 
the lebanese civil war is still ongoing and there is more 
factionalism in lebanon now than ever he said so many things 
dont bode well for the hostages they are still alive because it is 
in the best interest of the hostagetakers to keep them alive 
at the state department michael mahoney is the designated 
contact with the family members he said he tries to call the 
families every two weeks to reassure them someone is paying 
attention to them and to put current events in their proper 
context 
mahoney also monitors the dozens of letters the department 
receives each month from americans on the hostages in the 18 months 
he has worked at the job mahoney said he has not noticed any change 
in the volume

the internal revenue service under heavy fire 
for often answering taxpayers questions incorrectly will not slow 
its processing of tax refunds despite scattered personnel and supply 
shortages caused by the budget crunch acting commissioner michael 
murphy said thursday 
we have a management problem trying to conserve resources 
we are looking for about 50 million to continue present levels of 
operations for the next six months murphy told the house ways and 
means oversight subcommittee but the irs will not let the problem 
slow returns processing reduce services to taxpayers or deter the 
agencys enforcement efforts he vowed 
on another problem murphy appeared to confirm reports that the 
irs has had a policy of sometimes not telling taxpayers when they 
neglect to take credit for taxes withheld from their paychecks that 
would result in an overpayment of taxes 
until last december murphy told rep harold ford dtenn some 
credits were not picked up at one stage of the agencys review 
of tax returns and it is possible that taxpayers did not get the 
refund they were entitled to 
although changes in those procedures were made last year murphy 
added i still am not completely satisfied with that program he 
said he has asked for a report from other irs officials 
the existence of such a policy was asserted by irs employees in 
memphis in interviews with sen albert gore jr dtenn and the 
associated press 
one employee speaking only on the condition she not be named 
said an agency handbook prohibited telling a taxpayer that he or she 
had neglected to subtract taxes withheld from taxes owed in most 
such cases she said taxpayers were overcharged by 100 to 1000 
and often these cases involved retirees pensions 
when irs headquarters in washington was asked about the policy 
she said we were told the taxpayers had to find their own 
mistakes 
there were so many complaints from irs workers about the policy 
that it was modified last year to permit notification of taxpayers 
who failed to subtract taxes withheld from wages or from periodic 
pension payments the employee said but the old policy remains in 
effect in cases of lumpsum pension payments 
the memphis worker is involved in an irs program to identify 
taxpayers who failed to report some or all of their income she and 
others in the program start checking returns about 15 months after 
they are filed if they find underreporting they send the taxpayer 
a form letter asking for an explanation 
after murphy testified thursday his principal spokesman ellen 
murphy said the agencys policy is to make sure that people who 
are entitled to refunds get them 
murphy spent a good deal of his time before the house panel 
apologizing that irs employees in some areas of the nation are 
correctly answering taxpayers telephoned questions barely half the 
time 
our accuracy rate is unacceptable he said we will not be 
satisfied until we see substantial improvement 
although the irs and the general accounting office disagree on 
just how often telephone assistors are wrong the precise figure 
didnt seem to matter to members of the subcommittee 
youre talking about whether we should give you a d or a 
dminus said rep jj pickle dtexas the chairman calling 
the irs for tax advice is a real crapshoot 
the irs and the gao have been exchanging words since march 10 
when the irs called a news conference to announce that its 5000 
employees who answer taxpayers telephoned questions were giving 
correct answers about 71 percent of the time 
the gao said the correct figure for the nation was closer to 62 
percent and said the irs had labeled some misleading answers as 
correct 
murphy apologized for the irs interpretation but ironically the 
gao thursday announced that an updated although more limited test 
indicated that irs employees were correct about 66 percent of the 
time 
murphy acknowledged that the irs and its 115000 employees who 
collect about 1 trillion a year in taxes are having trouble living 
within their 52 billion budget the washington post quoted 
unidentified sources thursday as saying the agency is in the 
throes of a fullfledged cash crisis 
much of the trouble can be traced to the fact that congress gave 
the irs 100 million less this year than it asked for and then 
required the agency to cut other programs to finance a pay raise for 
workers the irs saw the trouble coming late last year and asked the 
white house to request additional money but the white house refused

some of the best engineering students in new 
england are busy trying to build cars that will take them 200 miles 
over four days 
that wont be so easy as it sounds because the cars will have to 
be powered only by the sun the montpelier vttocambridge mass 
race called the american tour de sol is set for may 2528 
the race is patterned after a competition in switzerland that has 
attracted hundreds of entries since it began in 1985 including 
several from the schools involved in the new england race this year 
theres a very high interest level said dartmouth professor 
robert wills who is coordinating the race at dartmouth the 
solar car project has attracted the most interest of any engineering 
project that ive seen 
the winning team will get a trip to the european race also 
called the tour de sol this summer 
solarpowered cars use photovoltaic cells to collect energy from 
sunlight that power their electric motors the cars can reach speeds 
of more than 60 mph 
doug fraser coordinator of the dartmouth team said it is 
redesigning parts of the car that entered last years european race 
but was disqualified because of a technical problem in the drive 
system changes will include a new drive system and a new computer 
we did pretty well considering we were using a backup drive 
system fraser said 
the other four schools participating are new hampshire technical 
institute massachusetts institute of technology the university of 
lowell and worcester polytechnic institute 
i dont know of any single activity on campus that has created 
as much enthusiasm as the solar car project said david larrabee 
president of new hampshire tech 
wills said the race will be run along back roads and will take 
the competitors through each of the five campuses the times for the 
four daily legs of the race will be compared to calculate the winner 
we managed to hit all the campuses and thats a big selling 
point for us he said everyone on the campuses will be able to 
see the cars 
though the tour de sol cars are designed with the hope that one 
could someday be used commercially for now their cost is too high 
fraser said the dartmouth car for example cost about 80000 
wills said students get their schools or companies to sponsor the 
cars but the cost is worth it because students learn about many 
engineering problems 
even the professors learn a lot he said

earlier in the day corrections officers thomas murphy 39 and 
david michael dumers 35 and deputy warden raymond murray 52 were 
charged with murdering ortega who was in jail on a burglary charge 
hudson county prosecutor paul m depascale said ortega 28 was 
beaten for 15 to 20 minutes in a jail elevator and left for 16 hours 
in a basement holding cell before guards summoned medical help 
he died saturday at a hospital where he was brought two days 
earlier in a coma a coroners report said he was beaten in the 
head arms and body ortegas brother angel said inmates told his 
family that guards used nightsticks on ortega 
the defendants were unable to raise 50000 bail and were sent to 
the bayonne city jail which was ordered closed by the state a month 
ago because it had no cameras to watch for suicide attempts 
officials are deciding whether to install cameras 
superior court judge kevin callahan said he would not send the 
three to the hudson county jail for fear of exposing them to attacks 
from other inmates 
the county board of freeholders in response to protests over the 
killing said it would investigate allegations about the existence 
of a goon squad of corrections workers who routinely beat 
inmates 
depascale said there is a special unit that responds to crises 
but that there was no evidence of unprovoked attacks no other 
criminal charges are planned he said

president reagan approved airdropping 
intelligence data and recoilless rifles to help the nicaraguan 
contra rebels sink two ships carrying arms oliver norths 
irancontra trial was told today 
the disclosure came during testimony by former national security 
adviser robert mcfarlane norths onetime boss at the national 
security council 
north lawyer brendan sullivan questioned mcfarlane about a top 
secret oct 3 1985 memo from north to mcfarlane in which north 
recommended the us government airdrop intelligence to the contras 
as mcfarlane examined the memo on the witness stand sullivan 
said mcfarlanes deputy john poindexter approved the 
recommendation and that poindexter added the words president 
approved 
the approval came at a time when the boland amendment prohibited 
any us government agency involved in intelligence activities from 
using money to assist the contras 
according to sullivans description of the memo the steps north 
recommended were not only extraordinary but also expensive and 
followed a meeting on the matter by the restricted agency group 
mcfarlane described that as an interagency committee that made 
recommendations on nicaragua with one deputy from each of 
several departments involved in intelligence 
the last page of norths memo describes what to tell the 
president said sullivan who read portions of it aloud 
one portion the lawyer read said that we intend to air drop 
intelligence along with two recoilless rifles which will be used to 
sink one or both of the arms carriers 
mcfarlane said the recoilless rifles are designed to knock out 
a very hard target such as a tank a bunker or a plane on the 
ground 
or sink a ship as it says here added sullivan 
mcfarlane said the memo didnt come to him since poindexter 
dealt with it 
poindexter who succeeded mcfarlane as president reagans 
national security adviser was in another courtroom today for 
housekeeping matters concerning his case on charges that resemble 
norths 
us district judge aubrey robinson said he hoped that 
poindexters irancontra trial can get under way in summer or early 
fall after norths trial ends and that he has not decided whether 
he or another judge will preside 
the case had been in gesells court but the judge decided he 
didnt want to hear it in the meantime robinson said he will take 
care of any pretrial matters 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh told the judge he does not 
know yet whether the government will follow its action in the north 
case and drop two key charges conspiracy and theft of government 
property that had been lodged against poindexter 
mcfarlane testified wednesday at norths trial that inducements 
worth 110 million were discussed orally with honduras president 
but not given to him in writing 
the honduran deal and other thirdcountry help to the contras 
were kept secret because the countries relations with congress 
would be damaged if the support was disclosed said mcfarlane 
also exposure would touch off a confrontation with congress he 
said 
four of the charges against north are that he lied to congress in 
1985 by denying that he was involved in assisting the contras 
a sept 13 1984 memo from north to mcfarlane detailed how an 
assistant secretary of state told congressional intelligence 
committees that foreign countries were providing support to the 
contras but that the state department official didnt know which 
ones 
mcfarlane acknowledged he took no steps to inform congress of 
what he reagan and others in the administration knew at the time 
that saudi arabia was providing 1 million a month for the contras 
the secret payments to honduras amounted to 35 million in 
speededup deliveries of rifles ammunition machine guns and other 
military aid plus 75 million in economic assistance in addition 
there is other unspecified assistance that is classified and which 
has not been disclosed at the trial 
reagan initialed his approval of the honduran plan on a memo 
dated feb 18 1985 
youre going to give them tens of millions of dollars to 
cooperate north lawyer brendan sullivan asked mcfarlane 
yes 
there is nothing dirty about quid pro quo is there 
no 
the honduran arrangement was made near the beginning of a 
twoyear span in which the socalled the boland amendment prohibited 
us military aid to the guerrillas

a passenger who tries to take a gun through an 
airport screening point even unwittingly could be fined at least 
1000 under a newly toughened federal aviation administration 
policy a spokesman said thursday 
if the weapon is loaded or there is an attempt to conceal it 
fines could range up to 10000 said spokesman fred farrar 
previously faa regional authorities could pursue smaller fines 
against firsttime offenders or issue warnings farrar said 
under the new order a penalty of 1000 would be sought in civil 
court if the firearm was unloaded and ammunition was not accessible 
to the passenger this would be increased to 2000 if ammunition 
was found 
the fine could be 2500 for a loaded firearm and from 5000 to 
10000 if there was an attempt to conceal even an unloaded weapon 
if a gun was used along with a threat the civil penalty could be at 
least 10000 in addition to any punishment that might result from 
criminal prosecution 
the faa said 2773 firearms were detected in airports last year 
leading to 1493 arrests farrar said he could not immediately 
determine how many of the cases had led to successful prosecutions 
or the size of fines imposed 
the agency said more than 70 percent of the guns were loaded a 
survey showed that 26 guns discharged in luggage between 1975 and 
1986 including one that killed an airline employee 
the faa said the only legal way to transport a gun aboard an 
aircraft is in checked luggage and if its a handgun the luggage 
must be locked with the only key in the owners possession the 
weapon must be unloaded and the owner must declare it to the 
airline when the luggage is checked

council members hoping to keep 
undesirables off their wealthy island are considering installing 
closed circuit cameras to monitor bridges and the main highway into 
town 
town manager robert doney said the cameras would enable 
authorities to film vehicles pedestrians and cyclists anyone 
coming to palm beach to do anything of an illegal nature he said 
he thought the cameras could have a very good psychological effect 
on deterring crime 
town attorney john randolph said the constitutionality of the 
proposal submitted tuesday by a resident should be studied before 
the council votes on it and council members asked the towns public 
safety committee to study the matter 
council president nancy douthit said the idea was definitely 
worth the research 
the only people who might be bothered by this are those with a 
guilty conscience douthit said you are photographed any time 
you go into a bank any time you go through a toll booth on the 
turnpike and in many retail establishments and condo buildings i 
dont see this as being any different 
the proposal would place cameras on four bridges and on the 
towns approach on highway a1a from south palm beach

future inmates at the muskegon and ottawa 
county jails may have to give up more than their freedom to pay 
their debts to society they may also lose their cigarettes 
people in jail give up quite a bit said patricia rehfield 
medical director in ottawa county where a committee has recommended 
a cigarette ban in the jail and other county buildings smoking 
certainly can be part of that 
in muskegon county the sheriffs department has proposed that 
the county council make the entire department and jail smoke free 
may 1 said capt robert baker jail administrator 
it is not going to be easy for anyone baker said estimating 
that more than half the inmates smoke 
the ottawa and muskegon county proposals are inspired in part by 
an experimental ban begun six weeks ago at the grand traverse county 
jail officials in the two counties are monitoring that program 
before deciding whether to approve their own 
some officials are concerned a smoking ban could trigger more 
tension in the overcrowded jail system 
we are thinking about issuing hard candy with dinner baker 
said we might also put a popcorn machine in for the evenings 
that might take the edge off of it muskegon officials also plan 
to offer stopsmoking classes to inmates and employees

scheduled with staff administrators and students in favor of a 
campuswide meeting and to delay by a month the april 1 trustees 
vote on admitting men

october but that students learned of it only recently students 
one told stock feel segregated and manipulated

congress spurred on by president bushs 
promise to do something this year about acid rain is beginning what 
could be the final confrontation in an eightyear multimillion 
dollar lobbying war over clean air 
the opening volley was fired thursday when more than 100 house 
members most allied with environmental groups introduced 
legislation to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by more than 40 
percent and nitrogen oxide emissions by about half that amount the 
gases are the two major components of acid rain 
the bill drew expected strong support from environmental groups 
but was quickly opposed by the coal auto and electric utilities 
industries which have fought environmentalists to an expensive draw 
since the reagan administration took office in 1981 
this is the year for clean air said rep gerry sikorski 
dminn a sponsor of the legislation along with reps henry waxman 
dcalif and silvio conte rmass he cited the new attitude of 
president bush compared to that of former president reagan and 
increased public awareness and concern about our environment 
environmental groups cite bushs promise to solve the acid rain 
problem made during a trip to canada last month as one of two 
political developments that signal the battle may be near an end 
the other is the levation to majority leader of sen george j 
mitchell dmaine who sponsored last years cleanair legislation 
in that chamber 
for industry i think they know the nobill option is pretty 
well off the table said alexandra allen attorney for the us 
public interest research group a private environmental lobbying 
organization 
ron sykes senior washington represenative of general motors 
corp acknowledged the pressures for doing something this year 
are considerably more than they were last year 
but sykes said we seem to be charging down a path that is 
driven by what weve learned in the early years about acid rain 
and not what were about to learn from a 10year federal study 
scheduled for completion in mid1990 
he suggested the nation wait for the study a recommendation that 
reagan supported but bush rejected in canada 
gayla hoffman a spokeswoman for the nations largest coal 
producer peabody holding co of st louis said her company is 
opposed to additional controls beyond those already in place in the 
clean air act 
and diane smiroldo a spokeswoman for edison electric institute 
representing the nations electric utilities said that the 
current clean air act is working and that any legislation at 
this point is premature 
acid rain and another aspect of the clean air debate dirty air 
caused by ozone and carbon monoxide have been among the most 
heavily lobbied issues in congress 
according to records on file in the house and senate citizens 
for sensible control of acid rain was the top lobbying spender in 
1986 the organization bankrolled principally by electric utilities 
and coal companies spent 3028235 on behalf of a grassroots 
direct mail campaign opposing legislation mandating stricter acid 
rain emissions acid rain legislation did not get near the floor 
that year 
but that figure did not include spending by individual 
automakers lectric utilities and chemical and coal companies and 
their trade associations according to ms allen she said 
environmental lobbying groups spent only a fraction of industry 
expenditures 
the industry groups also have had strong allies in congress the 
house energy and commerce chairman rep john dingell dmich and 
the former senate majority leader sen robert c byrd dwva 
the house bill would require that sulfur dioxide emissions be 
reduced by 10 million tons and nitrogen oxide emissions by 4 million 
tons by 1998 currently an estimated 22 million tons of sulfur 
dioxide and 21 million tons of nitrogen oxide are being emitted into 
the air 
the two gases are converted in the atmosphere into acids which 
travel far from their starting points to pollute lakes and forests 
and according to some health experts cause serious respiratory 
problems for asthmatics children and the elderly 
the leading sources of sulfur dioxide are coalburning electric 
power plants and industrial facilities nitrogen oxides are emitted 
in approximately equal amounts by motor vehicles and industry 
congress has been divided along regional lines the northeast 
the primary victim of acid rain wants immediate action midwestern 
states with many older coalfired power plants fear controls that 
will boost electric bills 
states that produce large amonts of highsulfur coal indiana 
illinois ohio west virginia and pennsylvania worry that controls 
will cause massive job losses in the coal industry 
the west where lowsulfur coal is mined and acid rain is not a 
serious problem is reluctant to pay the cost for new controls 
under the new house bill 
electric utilities would receive federal subsidies to protect 
residential customers from rate hikes of more than 10 percent as a 
result of the sulfur dioxide controls 
motor vehicle manufacturers would be required to tighten 
tailpipe standards for nitrogen oxide and hydrocarbons 
the epa would be required to control hydrocarbon vapors by 
requiring onboard vehicle canisters or controls at the gas pump 
sykes said the canisters are unsafe and could cause fires in 
crashes in hot weather and if a leak develops in the emissions 
system

the senate foreign relations committee voted 
unanimously today to approve the nomination of lawrence eagleburger 
as the no 2 man at the state department ending a controversy over 
his ties to former secretary of state henry a kissingers 
international consulting firm 
the 190 vote came after eagleburger who earned more than 
900000 last year as president of kissinger associates agreed to 
voluntarily disqualify himself from all matters involving former 
clients of the firm during his government service 
but eagleburger was not been required to divulge the names of 
those clients to the committee a move sought by sen jesse helms 
rnc several senators pointed out that such a request put the 
nominee in the position of making disclosures beyond those required 
under the ethics in government act 
the nomination now goes to the full senate which is expected to 
approve eagleburger as undersecretary of state on friday 
the vote came after helms grilled eagleburger about his ties to 
kissingers firm 
henry kissinger was a political entity he still is thats 
why larry eagleburger got well over a million dollars the senator 
said 
helms brought up the difficulties encountered by former sen john 
tower in his recent failed attempt to become defense secretary due 
in part to his financial ties to defense contractors 
i wish he had an opportunity to answer questions in public 
about his income helms said he wasnt allowed to defend 
himself against many of the allegations 
helms a staunch conservative also has been critical for years 
of kissingers conduct of foreign policy especially moves toward 
closer relations with the soviet union during the nixon and ford 
administrations 
helms has asked eagleburger a longtime kissinger ade to turn 
over a confidential list of all of the clients of kissinger 
associates even though eagleburger may not have worked for all of 
the clients during his four years with the new yorkbased consulting 
firm 
eagleburger and his attorney william rogers told the committee 
that if pressed they would comply with the request but believed it 
set a poor precedent 
mr eagleburger and kissinger are prepared to comply said 
rodgers but its an open door the committee could push through if 
they like 
rodgers contended that such a broad request would make it 
difficult for any person who had served in the private sector to 
enter government service 
the attorney pointed out that eagleburger has cut all ties with 
kissinger associates sold all his stock and offered to disqualify 
himself for a period of one year from any dealings involving any of 
the clients he served while with the firm 
sens nancy kassebaum rkan and joseph biden ddel objected 
to helms line of questioning 
you cant design something that will fit all situations mrs 
kassebaum said pointing out that the state department is unlike the 
defense department 
we have to keep in mind common sense and good judgment she 
said speaking of problems of conflict of interest 
eagleburger who has filed financial disclosure forms showing he 
made 915000 last year while working as the president of the firm 
testified wednesday that he has cut all ties with the firm and an 
affiliate kent associates eagleburger also said he had sold all 
his investment stocks 
eagleburger received numerous plaudits for his years at the state 
department including service as ambassador to yugoslavia and 
undersecretary of state but most questions centered on his contacts 
with the international clients of kissingers firm 
id rather be safe than sorry and right now i dont know 
what the facts are helms argued in asking for the list of 
clients the senator promised the list would be held in confidence 
saying i dont think anybody on this committee would leak one 
word of this 
if the senate does not act this week the nomination could be 
delayed for several weeks because members leave friday for a 
twoweek easter recess 
several senators on the panel called for timely action on the 
nomination given the dearth of confirmed officials in the upper 
levels of the bush administration 
eagleburger testified that he had provided the committee with a 
list of the clients he had personally dealt while with at the firm 
and a description of his work for them in a generic sense but 
he said he was prevented from disclosing additional information 
under the firms confidentiality contract with its clients 
the firms include such concerns as anheuserbusch the south 
korean conglomerate daewoo corp hj heinz and the italian car 
maker fiat spa itt corp ab volvo union carbide cocacola 
and midland bank 
he also testified that under advice from the office of government 
ethics he would disqualify himself for a period of one year from 
any future matters at the state department involving the clients he 
worked with while with the firms 
there will be no conflicts of interest because i have no 
outside interests eagleburger said 
he also argued that his step to disqualify himself for the 
oneyear period on all matters involving former clients was 
voluntary and went beyond the requirements of the ethics in 
government act which he said only required a recusal casebycase 
but given the current climate on capitol hill in the wake of the 
intense scrutiny of tower over his failed nomination to head the 
defense department of defense eagleburger was queried during his 
initial hearing about everything from his 30 years in government 
service to his personal habits 
sen gordon humphrey rnh apparently in jest even asked 
eagleburger at one point have you ever in public or private 
pinched a womans behind 
the room erupted in nervous laughter with eagleburger responding 
in the negative

israeli teenagers are playing a form of russian 
roulette that involves dodging speeding cars in an apparent attempt 
to share the dangers faced by israeli soldiers an official said 
thursday 
the game which has swept the country in epidemic form appears 
in different versions nationwide said shai gadish head of the 
education ministrys road safety unit 
teenagers either lie in the path of an approaching car and wait 
until the last moment to scamper away or leave school bags in the 
middle of the road darting out to snatch them from oncoming cars 
gadish said in an interview with the associated press 
the education and transportation ministries have sent 
psychologists to high schools in an attempt to discover why the 
dangerous game is so popular he said 
gadish said teenagers hear about the brave deeds of older 
friends and brothers in the army they want to imitate them by 
exhibiting their own courage by endangering their own lives 
he said 
israelis are drafted into the army on their 18th birthday men 
serve for three years and women for two 
we live in a society where you need to show courage gadish 
said these youths know its dangerous in the streets and that 
they can show their bravery there 
only one youth has been slightly injured playing the game 
transportation ministry officials said 
gadish said teens usually play the game on their way home from 
school and high school principals have asked parents to discourage 
their children from participating 
we are worried that the more publicity this game of russian 
roulette in the streets receives the more popular it will become 
said atniel schneller of the transportation ministry

three federal agencies proclaimed today that 
apples are safe for children to eat attempting to calm fears about 
a chemical used by some growers that has been linked to cancer and 
claims that preschoolers are especially vulnerable 
the federal government believes that it is safe for americans 
to eat apples said a joint statement by the environmental 
protection agency food and drug administration and agriculture 
department 
the agencies said there is no imminent hazard posed to 
children by the consumption of apples 
at a senate hearing fda administrator frank young noted that he 
moved swiftly to raise concerns about fruit imported from chile 
after traces of cyanide were found in two grapes he declared he 
would do the same if he thought apples were dangerous for children 
there has been growing concern among parents and school officials 
about whether children should continue eating apples and apple 
products until questions about the health questions 
at the center of the controversy is the chemical daminozide sold 
under the trade name alar which the epa said has caused cancer in 
test animals last month a private environmental group issued a 
report suggesting that children are especially at risk from alar 
because they consumer many times more apples and apple products 
compared to their weight than adults 
school systems in a number of cities including new york chicago 
and los angeles have stopped providing children apples after the 
report by the natural resources defense council was made public and 
the cbs program 60 minutes reported on the controversy 
in a statement the three federal agencies said the federal 
government encourages school systems and other responsible for the 
diets of children to continue to serve apples and other nutritious 
fruit to american children 
young said the reaction to claims that young children are exposed 
to a dangerous levels of alar in apples has caused a panic that 
is not warranted he said there is not a signficant risk at this 
time facing the american people in the consumption of apples 
john moore acting deputy epa administrator told the senate 
subcommittee on children families drugs and alcoholism that while 
the epa has conclude that daminozide causes cancer its continued 
use does not pose a threat that would warrant the chemical being 
ordered immediately off the market 
moore in his testimony criticized the nrdc studys risk estimates 
as not being scientifically sound and said the report has caused 
misinformation and fear to dominate the debate nevertheless 
moore said if daminozide were a newly introduced pesticide it would 
not be approved 
sen brock adams dwash suggested that the manufacturer of 
alar would do us all a public service if they suspended production 
of the product because the controversy is harming the apple 
industry 
adams said most growers in washington state do not use 
daminozide but there was no agreement among witnesses as to how 
widespread the use of the chemical actually is 
young said the fda has concluded that about 10 percent of the 
apples are sprayed with alar but the epa has cited a figure of 
about 5 percent consumer groups have claimed that spot checks have 
shown a use as high as 30 percent 
several senators said the controversy is threatening the apple 
industry the apple market is dead as a doornail right now across 
america said sen steven symms ridaho whose family owns an 
apple orchard

a surfer bitten by a shark at a public beach has 
lost a lawsuit against the county in which he charged that as in the 
movie jaws authorities failed to warn bathers because of a 
holiday weekend 
a jury deliberated 77 minutes wednesday before rejecting a 
63000 claim by jonathan popper against dade county over a leg 
injury he received in the may 21 1983 attack 
popper 22 when he was bitten had argued that sharks were 
sighted off haulover beach in the days prior to his attack but no 
warning was issued even though lifeguards commonly post signs 
advising of dangerous currents and poisonous jellyfish 
why would dade county make the decision to expose people to 
sharks rather than expose sharks to people poppers attorney jay 
rothlein said in his summary there can be only one reason there 
was a holiday weekend coming up and sharks are bad for buisiness 
assistant county attorney ron bernstein called those arguments 
absurd 
as this trial went on it became apparent these men were trying 
to orchestrate the sequel to jaws bernstein said 
in the peter benchley novel jaws and the movie made from it 
the mayor of a fictional beach town fails to heed warnings about 
shark dangers for fear it will hurt businesses awaiting a holiday 
weekend crowd 
bernstein also noted that popper had been surfing in the area for 
10 years prior to the attack and was back surfing in the same spot 
six months later

president bush today challenged charges that his 
administration is adrift saying he is trying to defuse ticking 
time bombs while charting an agenda for america in the next 
century 
in this kind of work more is going on than meets the eye or 
makes the headlines bush said 
in a state where savings and loan failures have become regular 
events bush prodded congress to move quickly on his threeweekold 
plan to save the beleagured industry theres no excuse for 
further delay he said 
the essential question today is what are we doing to prepare 
for the new world that begins 11 short years from now he said 
thats what my agenda is all about 
in his first trip west since his inauguration jan 20 the 
president flew to texas and colorado for a pair of speeches 
his first stop was in houston for a luncheon appearance before 
the forum club which bills itself as a nonpartisan educational 
institution next he was flying to colorado springs colo to 
address the junior achievement national business leadership 
conference 
in the houston appearance bush ticked off a series of 
initiatives from his new administration a spending and 
deficitreduction plan a program to relieve third world debt a 
proposal to rescue the savings and loan industry and an increase in 
the minimum wage 
on the savings and loan crisis bush again assured depositors 
that their savings are safe they are fully protected and will 
continue to be fully protected he said in recent months sampl 
customers have been withdrawing deposits at a record rate 
bush said the sampl industry must be cleaned up so that the 
questionable ractices and outright illegalities that caused the 
current crisis wont happen again 
moreover he said we must see to it that those sampl officials 
guilty of criminal actions are pursued and punished for the losses 
they have caused 
these are serious challenges ticking time bombs that we need 
to defuse without delay he said and were doing just that 
but these are by no means the only issues that demand 
leadership and prompt action were entering the 1990s a horizon 
decade threshold to a new century 
he said that building a better america means laying the 
foundations today for the kind of future we want 
along those lines bush said the united states needs to take 
steps to safeguard the environment against shortsighted actions 
that do longterm damage 
it means finding ways to preserve and strengthen indispensable 
institutions like the family in the midst of social change he 
said it means taking a longrange look at the international 
landscape to determine what policies and approaches will keep us 
free prosperous and at peace in the 21st century as we are today 
and speaking of freedom it means formulating a multisource 
energy policy that in the long run will make us less dependent on 
foreign oil the president a former texas oilman said in this 
petroleumoriented city 
bush said the nation must invest in its own economy with new 
incentives for business including catalysts for research and 
development he called anew for a reduction in the capital gains tax 
in addition bush said the nation must encourage and improve 
education 
we arent going to clean up the environment turn our education 
system around or create a more responsive business climate in a 
single day he said but if we begin today and make steady 
progress we will succeed 
in this kind of work he said more is going on than meets 
the eye or makes the headlines the proof will come when we look 
back from the year 2000 
in his speech bush was warmly applauded by the audience of more 
than 1000 people when he raised the controversial subject of 
restrictions on militarystyle assault weapons 
i do want to find the solution to the socalled ak47 assault 
weapon problem one that protects the rights of the legitimate 
sportsman but also protects the lives of our police officers who 
are laying their lives on the line he said 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater told reporters that 
bush applauded the decision of colt industries to suspend sales of 
its popular ar15 semiautomatic rifle asked if other industries 
should follow suit fitzwater said the administration would stand 
pat for now 
in recent speeches the president has been emphasizing his 
actions thus far including proposals for rescuing the savings and 
loan industry relieving third world debt cutting the deficit and 
combating the problems of drugs the environment and child care 
let us recognize that we stand at a special moment in our 
history bush said in a speech wednesday night before the 
electronic industries association an industry trade group 
it is a moment not for complacency not to sit back and reflect 
upon what has been but to reflect upon what might be 
bush said he has established four objectives to reduce the 
deficit invest in the nations future confront problems that 
cannot wait and avoid imposing new taxes 
these four objectives will build on the progress of the last 
eight years they will build a better america bush said they 
will reaffirm our strengths defuse ticking time bombs and reorient 
us as a nation 
todays speech came amid skepticism from democrats that congress 
and the administration can reach a quick agreement on a new spending 
plan neither side has been willing to propose either new taxes or 
new spending cuts to reduce the deficit 
bush said a recent poll of corporate leaders found they believe 
americans are too shortterm oriented 
my plan speaks to the long term and to a stable business 
climate bush said it says that to remain competitive we must 
look beyond the next quarterly statement 
bush used the occasion to underscore his request for a cut in the 
capital gains tax to 15 percent saying that nothing could make 
america more competitive 
a congressional study released this week said that 80 percent of 
the benefits from bushs proposed capital gains tax cut would go to 
americans making more than 100000 a year

the soviet union has increased its 
military presence in the persian gulf since the iraniraq 
ceasefire despite publicly urging withdrawal of foreign navies 
from the region a us military official said thursday 
gen h norman schwarzkopf commander of us forces in the gulf 
said the soviet navy continues escorting that nations tankers while 
the united states and other navies have scaled back escort 
operations 
i see no withdrawal of the soviets in this area schwarzkopf 
told reporters as a matter of fact i see an increase in their 
diplomatic initiatives and their military assistance 
initiatives 
schwarzkopf said there has been a gradual reduction of us 
forces in the gulf since an aug 20 ceasefire halted fighting in 
the eightyear war between iran and iraq 
the us naval force in the gulf and the arabian sea now consists 
of 23 ships and will soon be cut to 19 pentagon officials said 
schwarzkopf said the unit which has operated in the gulf since 
1949 would wind up slightly larger than the six ships in the region 
before mid1987 when forces were boosted to protect us shipping 
during the escalating war 
schwarzkopf said soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze who 
visited iraq and iran on a recent regional tour did not honestly 
state the number of soviet ships in the gulf 
i will tell you without going into details that his 
mathematics are very bad compared to what weve seen here 
schwarzkopf said 
us military sources say the soviets maintain seven to nine 
ships in and near the gulf including missile frigates and 
destroyers the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
there has been no significant change in the soviet force since the 
gulf war truce 
the soviets now have a permanent presence in the arabian gulf 
that theyve never had before schwarzkopf said they have a 
very heavy presence of forces in the red sea which of course mr 
schevardnadze didnt talk about 
he said the soviets also had an overwhelming number of military 
advisers and military men in south yemen the only communist 
regime in the arab world in ethiopia iraq and other countries 
and have a very large troop presence just north of the 
sovietiran border

an adults right to refuse medical 
treatment in the face of death was upheld thursday by the florida 
supreme court in a case involving a jehovahs witness who was forced 
to accept blood transfusions 
privacy rights and religious freedom supersede the medical 
professions interest in saving lives the justices ruled 61 the 
court noting the woman did not want to die said its ruling was not 
condoning suicide 
the decision was a victory for norma wons who sought care for 
uterine bleeding in april 1986 doctors said she was lapsing in and 
out of consciousness and death was imminent at the time 
while still conscious she fought against receiving transfusions 
because jehovahs witnesses believe it defies a biblical passage in 
leviticus whatsoever man eats any manner of blood i will cut 
him off from among his people 
a court in miami ordered doctors at the countyrun jackson 
memorial hospital to perform transfusions mrs wons regained 
consciousness and continued her court battle 
her attorney john d kelner said the bleeding is likely to 
recur 
that is one of the things that made the issue not moot with the 
court said kelner she has expressed her preference in writing 
that should she suffer from it again she be allowed to refuse 
transfusions 
hospital officials represented by the hospitals public health 
trust of dade county said letting mrs wons die would leave her two 
children without proper nurturing 
mrs wons 41 argued that her husband supported her decision and 
the children would be cared by him his mother and brothers 
the high court said mrs wons wasnt necessarily ignoring the 
best interest of her children and shouldnt be viewed as returning 
to a normal life after having been forced to commit a sin against 
religious laws 
her death may have been necessary to ensure her spiritual life 
chief justice raymond ehrlich wrote in a separate opinion agreeing 
with the majority 
as a parent she also must consider the example she sets 
for her children how to teach them to follow what she believes is 
gods law if she herself does not the choice for her cannot be an 
easy one but it is hers to make ehrlich wrote 
justice ben overton in the sole dissent said mrs wons death 
would have been unnecessary and guessed the court would have 
surprised one of the framers of the us constitution 
to justify as a right of the free exercise of religion a 
parents right to abandon a minor child through a death which is 
totally unecessary is in my view neither a reasonable nor a 
logical interpretation of the first amendment wrote overton 
james madison would not believe that his free exercise clause 
could ever be interpreted in this manner

congressional negotiators on the federal budget 
said thursday they detected a move toward compromise with the bush 
administration on which taxes should be raised 
president bushs recommended 116 trillion budget for fiscal 
1990 which opens oct 1 proposed to bring in about 14 billion 
through higher taxes fees for government services and sales of 
government assets the white house contends its specific proposals 
dont violate bushs no new taxes campaign pledge 
lawmakers said there was little chance of enactment for many of 
the presidents tax proposals such as expanding the medicare tax to 
all state and local employees and cutting the capitalgains tax rate 
i think they recognize the problem that the revenues that are 
presented right now that theres some difficulty in achieving 
those said rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house 
budget committee but it was important that the overall total of 14 
billion still be raised he said 
panetta and other congressional budgetwriters met thursday with 
bush budget director richard darman treasury secretary nicholas 
brady and the senior members of congress taxwriting committees 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance 
committee said the democrats were not proposing to raise more money 
than bush proposed 
i think they understand revenues are needed and theyve 
outlined a number of revenues he said my message was whatever 
we do has to be credible that we have to show the financial markets 
that weve seriously addressed the problem of the deficit 
yes i think there is some movement he said when asked if 
progress was made in the meeting 
brady declined to answer reporters questions darman said there 
was no change in the administrations position but he did not want 
to comment on what the lawmakers said 
the grammrudman law mandates that the federal deficit which is 
expected to exceed 163 billion this year be reduced to 100 
billion in the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
panetta in a breakfast speech at the us chamber of commerce 
said the scope of the budget talks would be limited by president 
bushs willingness or unwillingness to discuss raising taxes he 
said taxes needed to be raised and spending cut to produce a serious 
deficitreduction plan 
with the budget negotiators looking for places to cut spending 
pressure continued to increase spending 
the senate armed services committee by voice vote approved a 
recommendation that congress adopt bushs plan to increase military 
spending next year to keep pace with inflation and boost it 1 
percent above inflation the next two years 
rep rep gv sonny montgomery dmiss chairman of the 
house veterans affairs committee told a house budget task force 
that spending on veterans health programs must increase faster than 
bush is proposing 
what the budget committee decides in the next few weeks will 
probably be long remembered he said citing a crisis in the 
system and the contribution he said the programs make to the 
nations defense 
so if we must delay the procurement of one or two bombers in 
order to insure that our veterans receive needed health care then 
we must do it its an easy choice for me he said

major us jewish groups are calling on jews 
around the world to boycott meetings with pope john paul ii because 
the vatican has failed to remove a convent from the site of the nazi 
death camp at auschwitz the world jewish congress announced 
thursday 
the us section of the world jewish congress which represents 
34 american groups adopted a resolution that calls for wjc members 
in 70 countries to refrain from meetings with the pope during his 
frequent travels 
the resolution adopted at a meeting of organization leaders in 
new york will be introduced at the may 7 meeting of the wjcs 
international executive in montreal 
the resolution said the boycott call was an expression of 
anguish and moral distress at the roman catholic churchs failure 
to comply with a 1987 agreement that would remove the carmelite 
convent to grounds outside the extermination camp in poland 
the convent controversy is symptomatic of a clear pattern by 
the vatican to revise the history of the holocaust and the role of 
the church during that terrible period the resolution said pope 
pius xii has been widely criticized for failing to act or speak out 
against the nazis murder of 6 million jews during world war ii 
the clash over the convent comes at a time of increasing tensions 
between the world jewish community and the vatican nobel laureate 
elie wiesel a holocaust survivor and author recently accused pope 
john paul ii of trying to dejudaize the holocaust by ignoring 
jewish suffering in speeches and comments about that era 
jewish groups are also angry that the pope has met twice in the 
last three years with austrian president kurt waldheim who has been 
accused of complicity in nazi atrocities 
the convent at auschwitz was established in 1984 by a dozen 
carmelite nuns in a building the nazis had used to store poison gas 
canisters that action set of a storm of international protest from 
jews who wanted the camp site left undisturbed as a memorial to its 
victims 
jewish and catholic leaders met in geneva in 1987 and agreed that 
the convent would be removed by feb 22 1989 the church undertook 
in writing to move the nuns to nearby grounds outside the camp so 
they could continue their educational activities about the holocaust 
in recent months vatican officials have said a site had been 
chosen for the new convent one cleric said work on the building 
would soon be completed but a wjc delegation that visited the area 
in january said it had found no construction at all

housing construction plummeted 114 percent in 
february the government reported thursday with analysts blaming 
the sharp decline on harsher weather last month and the bite of 
higher mortgage interest rates 
the commerce department said new homes and apartments were built 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 15 million units last month 
as the weather turned cold again after an unseasonably mild january 
februarys pace was down from a rate of 169 million units in 
january the highest level in nearly two years 
analysts said a longerterm slowdown in the housing market is 
being caused by the steady upward climb of interest rates 
we dont expect housing to suddenly fall off the cliff this 
year but we do expect it to progressively weaken with higher 
interest rates said economist david berson of the federal 
national mortgage association 
interest on fixedrate mortgages averaged 1086 percent last 
week up from 984 percent a year earlier according to a survey by 
the federal home loan mortgage corp 
initial rates on adjustablerate mortgages were up even more 
sharply with the starting rate on a oneyear arm averaging 893 
percent last week up from 753 percent a year earlier 
kent colton executive vice president of the national association 
of homebuilders said rising interest rates were the dominant 
factor behind the associations forecast for a 7 percent slowdown 
in housing construction this year 
an increase of 1 percent in the interest charged on a 100000 
mortgage adds 62 a month to a homeowners payments colton said 
that has a big impact on affordability he said 
housing construction reached a postrecession peak in 1986 when 
181 million units were built then began sliding last year the 
level was 149 million units 
singlefamily homes were built in february at a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 105 million units down 131 percent from 
the pace in the previous month and the biggest drop in five years 
apartment construction meanwhile was down 72 percent in 
february to an annual rate of 453000 units construction of 
multifamily housing peaked in 1985 and then began a sharp slide 
largely the result of changes in the tax code that made such 
projects less attractive to investors 
berson said recent data on apartment construction have been more 
encouraging suggesting that the depressing effects of tax reform 
and overbuilding may be behind us now 
housing permits a bellwether of future housing activity fell 
68 percent last month to a rate of 14 million units after dropping 
38 percent during january februarys decline in permits was the 
biggest drop since a 9 percent fall in january 1988 
the building permits data for both months suggest that rising 
rates have taken a greater toll on housing than is suggested by the 
starts numbers said john a tuccillo chief economist for the 
national association of realtors 
the federal reserve board for a year has been nudging interest 
rates upward in an effort to slow the economy and restrain 
inflation most analysts expect interest rates to peak at midyear 
and then gradually decline again 
colton of the homebuilders said the fed has been reacting to 
inflation paranoia and risks driving the country into a 
recession by pushing interest rates too high 
we think that at a minimum the federal reserve needs to be very 
careful colton said 
housing activity dropped last month in all four regions of the 
country with the biggest decline in the northeast where starts 
fell 226 percent to 229000 units after surging 47 percent in 
january 
construction was down 137 percent in the midwest to 277000 
units and fell 87 percent in the west to 400000 units in the 
south starts were down 68 percent to 592000

communist party leaders today adopted a sweeping 
reform program for the inefficient soviet agricultural system that 
they hope will end chronic food shortages 
the plan adopted by the plenary meeting of the partys 
300member central committee would give the nations farmers the 
right to lease stateowned land for life however it would also 
maintain the network of state and collective farms that have 
chronically failed to feed the soviet people 
the party also elected its 100 members to the congress of 
peoples deputies a new legislative body that will meet for the 
first time this spring among them was president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
the plenum acted after debating gorbachevs plan to give farmers 
longterm leases on stateowned land to make them more attentive and 
efficient 
gorbachev also says farmers should be given freedom to decide 
what to plant on that land rather than having that decided by the 
bureaucracy 
politburo member yegor k ligachev told a news conference the 
leases could be signed for any period of more than five years and be 
passed on to succeeding generations of farmers he said no one would 
be forced into leasing land 
he also said the giant state and collective farms would remain 
the backbone of the soviet agricultural system 
radical changes in rural life and production relations should 
be carried out on a purely voluntary basis without any kind of 
force or repressive methods ligachev said in his first appearance 
before foreign reporters 
setting targets for leasing would only encourage strongarm 
tactics to fulfill the plans ligachev said 
ligachev is the politburo member in charge of farm policy and is 
widely regarded as a conservative force on the politburo 
before the plenum he spoke out for including leasing in a wide 
variety of methods to improve agricultural production he said the 
approach to agriculture will include leasing selffinancing and 
greater democracy in rural life 
the plenum abolished the giant gosagroprom superministry in 
charge of agricultural policy and gorbachev interrupted its chief 
vsevolod murakovsky who spoke out in favor of continuing the system 
in which all local regions are required to send a percentage of 
their harvest to central authorities 
showing his impatience with domination of local producers by the 
central bureaucracy gorbachev interrupted again when another 
speaker brought up the issue of the government orders 
in a speech on wednesday gorbachev painted a bleak picture of 
soviet agriculture with chemically despoiled land deliberate 
destruction of sound system prevalent in the 1920s and massive 
investments gone sour the situation is so bad that it will be years 
before the country can feed itself he said 
gorbachevs detailed report on years of failed reforms made it 
clear that he believes nothing less than radical change will free 
soviets from rationing of meat and cheese now found in many cities 
his proposal to abolish a government superagency created in 1985 
to oversee the countrys farm sector was a tacit acknowledgement of 
the failure of even his early attempts to revitalize agriculture

the head of the federal trade commission said 
thursday his agency has substantially stepped up its efforts to 
combat telemarketing fraud 
ftc chairman daniel oliver told a house panel that the commission 
fully supports the objectives of legislation intended to bring 
greater state resources to bear on telemarketing fraud 
it is estimated that consumers may lose over a billion dollars 
a year to telemarketing scam artists he said recognizing this 
threat the commission has greatly increased its enforcement efforts 
in this area in recent years 
oliver testified that since 1982 the ftc has opened more than 
80 investigations of telemarketers and has brought 33 fraud cases in 
federal court 
in these cases the commission obtained injunctions against 
companies having aggregate sales of over 628 million he said 
rep thomas a luken dohio chairman of the energy and commerce 
subcommittee on transportation and hazardous materials said that 
a combined federal state and private attack on telemarketing 
fraud will bring quicker and more effective enforcement save scarce 
federal dollars and provide for more uniformity in enforcement 
he noted that in fiscal 1983 the ftc spent about 410000 on 
telemarketing cases this rose to 23 million in fiscal 1988 and 
the ftc has told the panel that its staff expects to spend 48 
million on telemarketing investigations this fiscal year 
also testifying at thursdays hearing was nevada attorney general 
brian mckay who said that boiler room telemarketing is a 
difficult problem for state law enforcement these operators are 
cheap and mobile a boiler room essentially requires only leased 
office space and a leased telephone 
mckay said nevada has been a center for boiler room activity 
over 50 percent of all complaints received by the nevada consumer 
affairs division in 1987 concerned telemarketing in 1988 over 54 
percent of complaints were related to telemarketing

and under full electrical power after nasa engineers on wednesday 
fixed a problem with a hydrogen tank that had threatened to shorten 
the mission 
in a televisiontelephone hookup linking the white house and the 
shuttle bush praised the astronauts work and pledged continued 
support of the space program 
it is an inspiration to the americans ill tell you all of 
us todays pioneers said bush who could see the astronauts in 
the shuttle cabin 
and after discovery commander michael l coats told the president 
the crew was flying something for the new first lady bush replied

70mm camera being used to shoot environmentally damaged parts of the 
earth while flying upside down 180 miles high 
pilot john e blaha said the crew was getting a lot of great 
film that will show a lot of people around the world how fragile the 
planet earth is in this big vastness of space and maybe help 
everybody to work to improve that 
camera targets included a coral reef being destroyed by pollution 
off east africa areas of deforestation in south america an active 
volcano in guatamala and scars left by fires in floridas everglades 
and the forests of the western united states 
theres so much interest today on the global environment and i 
think a lot of people will see just from your important mission the 
contribution that space exploration can make to the worlds 
environment bush said

kirk in television series and movies sent congratulations to 
mission control 
discovery responded a mission control communicator tell

cut shortly before launch and will be killed after landing it is 
designed to test the effects of zero gravity on bone healing in 
space

an army report obtained by the rocky mountain news 
says pesticide pollution at the rocky mountain arsenal is harming 
and killing wildlife and posing a threat to humans who may eat the 
tainted game 
the report was based on a threeyear study of the pollutions 
effect on animals and plants at the 27square mile superfund cleanup 
site north of stapleton international airport the newspaper said in 
thursdays editions 
the report probably will determine the extent of the cleanup at 
the site a federal official said wednesday 
the report was compiled by environmental science and engineering 
inc an englewood colo consulting firm hired by the army it 
found that 
the flesh of game such as deer rabbits and pheasants contained 
contaminants in higher concentrations than us food and drug 
administration levels for safe human consumption 
grasshoppers eaten by waterfowl and raptors contained mercury 
and high levels of aldrin and dieldrin pesticide components known 
to cause thinning of egg shells and weight loss in birds 
dangerous levels of dieldrin in prairie dogs 
a minimum of 20000 waterfowl died during the 1950s after 
landing on polluted ponds at the arsenal 
dead coyotes owls and hawks found all over the rocky mountain 
arsenal had significant concentrations of pesticides in tissues 
the report said 
the army manufactured chemical weapons at the facility from 1942 
through the 1960s shell oil co leased a portion of the arsenal for 
pesticide production through the early 1980s waste from both 
operations are known to have polluted groundwater surface water and 
soil at the facility 
use of the old arsenal has been a subject of controversy federal 
and state officials including gov roy romer have suggested 
turning the land into a park or wildlife preserve 
health officials have warned however that extensive cleanup 
work must be completed in order for the animals to survive if 
contaminated water and soil are left untreated pollutants will 
continue to be absorbed by plants ingested by insects and carried 
up the food chain to large game animals they say 
if they continue to eat in contaminated areas the problem is 
only going to worsen said jeff edson a spokesman for the 
colorado department of health 
the environmental protection agencys project manager at the 
arsenal said wednesday the report will have an impact 
it looks like the study might drive the decisions regarding how 
clean it must be made said connally mears well pay particular 
attention to the implications from the study to determine what needs 
to be done to ensure protection of both public health and the 
environment 
army spokesman bill thomas in denver said wednesday the army 
didnt want to comment because the report was still in draft form

insurance industry study reported thursday in speculating that 
lawyers drive up insurance costs 
the study also said that on average one out of six accident 
victims hiring lawyers was steered to a particular doctor or clinic 
by the lawyer and said that people represented by lawyers hire 
substantially more chiropractors physical therapists and 
psychotherapists 
the findings came from a study of 46694 injury claims paid by 34 
insurance companies in the spring and summer of 1987 
those companies sell nearly 60 percent of us auto insurance 
the claims were made under five coverages bodily injury liability 
uninsured and underinsured motorists personal injury protection and 
medical payment 
states with high attorney involvement tend to have high auto 
injury costs and states with low attorney involvement tend to have 
low auto injury costs said the study conducted by the 
allindustry research advisory council a group of insurance 
industry trade associations and companies 
at the association of trial lawyers of america whose members are 
plaintiff attorneys in personal injury cases spokeswoman madeline 
applebaum said no one had seen the study and she could not comment 
the insurance group found that almost 45 percent of claimants 
hired lawyers up from more than 31 percent in 1977 the group 
speculated that the ending of restrictions on advertising by lawyers 
in 1978 might have helped cause the increase 
the average bodily injury claim payment increased 139 percent in 
those 10 years well ahead of the 85 percent increase in the 
consumer price index 
after noting a 124 percent increase in the cost of medical care 
the study said another possible reason for the large incurease in 
auto injury costs is that attorney involvement has increased 42 
percent since 1977

biologists stalking a 35foot california gray 
whale lost the migrating beast in fog before they could cut away a 
tangle of fishing nets that could kill it officials said thursday 
the northbound whale was spotted tuesday off dana point with 
netting wrapped around its flukes wildlife experts fear it will 
eventually drown said joe cordero of the national marine fisheries 
service 
we dont know how much netting is trailing underwater 
eventually the whale will probably tire out and die said 
cordero biologists participating in the rescue estimated the whale 
was trailing about 70 feet of netting 
a team of biologists from the long beachbased whale rescue unit 
followed the whale from dana point to the crystal cove area off 
laguna beach trying several times to get close and cut away the 
nets they lost it in fog near newport beach 45 miles southeast of 
los angeles 
the whale is moving at a pretty good clip and the rescuers 
couldnt catch up with it said cordero 
agent ray sautter another national marine fisheries service 
spokesman said it was extremely difficult to catch a whale moving 
in the water 
by the time you get a small boat over there they go down 
again sautter said it also stresses the animal and it may do 
more harm than good 
another california gray whale was reported ensnared in fishing 
nets early thursday off point conception 120 miles northwest of los 
angeles said sautter 
we are trying to get someone up there and free it he said 
whales began migrating from the warmer waters in mexico earlier 
this month and will continue their northward treks through may 
our real problem time is really next month and into may because 
the cowcalf pairs are the last to leave said sautter the 
young frequently get separated and get into trouble

the us government has tentatively concluded 
that a spy ring of west german computer hackers did not gain access 
to the types of secrets that would jeopardize americas national 
security the pentagon said thursday 
dan howard the defense departments chief spokesman said he was 
not at liberty to discuss the specific computer networks the german 
hackers penetrated what they learned in the process and what they 
passed on to the warsaw pact 
but in breaking two weeks of official silence howard said the 
defense department no longer viewed the case as a serious threat to 
military security 
based on the information that we have thus far and this is not 
complete our best judgment is that the computer hackers did not 
penetrate secure programs howard said 
the initial review of evidence assembled by american and west 
german authorities suggests the spy ring never gained access to the 
computer systems that contain classified secrets he continued 
all this is subject to change should new information turn up in 
the course of the investigation but to the best of our knowledge 
it does not appear at this point that there was any compromise of 
classified information howard said 
the west german government broke up the computer espionage 
operation march 3 arresting three individuals and later disclosing 
that eight others were still under investigation 
on march 6 a spokesman for the chief federal prosecutor in west 
germany alexander prechtel told reporters the continuing 
investigation suggested the information obtained by the hackers 
does not appear to be that sensitive 
the us government however had declined until thursday to say 
whether it agreed with that assessment 
the west german ring was cracked in large measure through the 
work of a lone us computer expert an astronomer named clifford 
stoll stoll has said he observed the ring trying to break into 
about 450 computer banks and that the hackers did gain access to 
the pentagons general data bank named optimus as well as 
computers at several defense contractors and us military bases 
west germanys ard television network has reported the hackers 
also tapped nasa and star wars research computers citing 
unidentified sources the network reported that three hackers handed 
over information from the united states japan britain france 
italy switzerland and west germany during a 1985 meeting with two 
kgb agents in east berlin 
the tv network also reported that authorities believe the west 
german hackers were recruited by the soviet intelligence agency in 
1985 and were paid with cash and drugs 
howard while breaking the us governments silence on the 
matter declined to confirm precisely which computer databanks the 
hackers penetrated 
no classified programs thats really about all i can say on 
the subject he replied 
i dont have any information that would imply there was any 
involvement by americans howard added

an american soldier who vanished 
for 11 days has been charged with giving east german officials us 
plans for defending the border against a soviet bloc assault the 
army said thursday 
a us military statement said the east germans notified us 
authorities that spec 4 michael a peri had made contact with them 
peri disappeared from his unit near the east german border feb 21 
taking a portable computer with him 
the 21yearold soldier from laguna niguel calif turned 
himself in 11 days later after a search that left american military 
officials baffled 
in washington pentagon sources said privately the east german 
government was quietly asked for help in locating peri soon after 
his disappearance because one said we had no idea if he was a 
defector had been hurt or whatever 
several days after the request we finally heard back from them 
saying they had identified such a person and had interviewed him 
but that he had left the source said 
we now believe he left east germany went to austria and then 
back into west germany to his unit we know he once lived in austria 
before he joined the army but we really dont know exactly whats 
going on here 
peri also brought back the computer he took from his unit where 
he worked as an electronics warfare signal specialist officials 
have said 
the specific information that we have based the charges on 
pertains to his units general defense plan lt col jake dye 
the us army 5th corps spokesman told the associated press in 
response to a question 
i am not really in a position to give any more information 
its inappropriate to comment any more pending the outcome of the 
investigation peri was assigned to the 11th armored cavalry 
regiment which isresponsible for a frontline defense at the 
border the unit based in fulda about 65 miles northeast of 
frankfurt is equipped with tanks and armored personnel carriers 
in a statement sent to news media the 5th corps said peri has 
been charged with espionage communicating documents andor 
information relating to national defense to the german democratic 
republic gdr 
he was further charged with unlawfully having classified 
information in his possession removing classified documents from a 
classified document storage area moving classified documents to the 
gdr and transfer of classified information to unauthorized 
persons the statement said 
it provided no further details about the information peri 
allegedly provided the east germans and did not mention any money 
changing hands or a possible motive it said no date had been set 
for his trial 
maj samuel taylor deputy spokesman for 5th corps told the ap 
the matter was us national defense information as far as it 
pertains to our nato mission and to the general defense plan as a 
nato force 
according to the written statement peri was charged with 
failure to obey the lawful regulations that require him to get 
permission to travel to the german democratic republic 
regulations also required him to check with his units special 
security officer before going into a communistcontrolled 
country 
the statement did not say where peri went in east germany or how 
he crossed the heavily guarded border he was being held at 
mannheim west germany and already has been charged with such other 
offenses as being absent without leave 
some news reports speculated that he defected because a military 
vehicle he signed out was found feb 23 near obersuhl a remote town 
northeast of fulda and near the border 
us officials said peri had been stationed in west germany since 
march 1988 he was responsible for operating equipment that detects 
enemy radar and other signals 
before his arrest army officials said peri was a good 
cleancut soldier with a perfect record 
in fact he had been promoted and nominated for soldier of the 
month twice in the year he has been here dye said earlier this 
month thats what makes it so baffling 
those who thought peri had defected recalled that pvt wade e 
roberts 22 of riverside calif defected in march 1987 with his 
west german girlfriend to the soviet union 
roberts returned to the united states in november 1987 he was 
tried as a deserter and given a badconduct discharge after 
conviction on the lesser charge of being absent without leave

the town of south padre island agreed 
thursday to allow a christian group to pass out its tracts on the 
beaches during spring break after a federal judge defended the 
rights of the evangelists 
ministers had sued the resort town after an official sent them a 
letter advising that distribution of the literature would violate an 
antisoliciting ordinance 
us district judge filemon vela however advised the town at a 
hearing that the public beaches are a public forum and that 
handing out religious literature was protected by the constitution 
ministers kevin pitt and jerry davis and davis street reach 
ministries sued here tuesday after receiving a letter from gary 
becher public works director for the island 
in the feb 3 letter to pitt belcher wrote i interpret 
preaching the word of god as soliciting and it therefore falls 
under these ordinances 
after velas remarks south padre island officials agreed to 
leave the ministers alone as long as they did not solicit funds on 
the beaches said paul cunningham town attorney 
vela said the agreement obviated the need for a restraining order 
against the town 
attorney jay sekulow representing the christian group said 
its unfortunate that it did have to come to court because 
frankly all that was involved was the distribution of free religious 
literature and sharing jesus on the beaches of south padre island 
pitt youth minister at brownsvilles nondenominational word of 
god family church said the group wants to provide an alternative to 
companies promoting beer and condoms to the 200000 to 300000 
students expected to visit the island 25 miles northeast of 
brownsville during the month of march

students will be required to salute the flag 
under a school board decision directing district administrators to 
delete a section of the state education code stating that a salute 
is not mandatory 
communism comes from liberalism silver valley unified school 
district board president bob woltman said wednesday adding that he 
is tired of liberalism in public schools 
its good for kids to honor our flag as it shows love for a 
country that offers the greatest opportunity in the world for people 
of all faiths and races said trustee carl von badinski 
a part of the education code allowing school boards to conform 
with a federal court ruling on individual freedom states 
individuals shall not be required to participate in the salute to 
the flag 
trustees of the district in the middle of the mojave desert 
ordered administrators to delete the paragraph when the policy comes 
up for final board review on march 27 
according to the districts assistant superintendent william 
maybee other provisions of the education code require elementary 
school classes to begin each day with the pledge of allegiance and 
an appropriate patriotic exercise in secondary school classes 
the us supreme court in 1943 ruled that the government may not 
compel citizens to salute the flag 
freedom of religion has nothing to do with saluting the flag 
von badinski said in this country people have the right to 
worship any religion they desire but it doesnt give them the right 
not to salute the flag

senate democrats debated in private on thursday 
over a broad agenda for the 101st congress that pledges not to 
oppose the bush administration automatically but to propose new 
policies and pursue them cooperatively 
a 10page draft agenda for action that served as the basis 
for the closeddoor discussion shied away from specifics on many of 
the major issues confronting congress it omitted any mention of the 
possible use of higher taxes to reduce the deficit and skipped over 
details of any effort to resolve the savings and loan crisis 
at the same time it called for enactment of a lengthy list of 
legislation that seemed certain to spark combat with the bush 
administration ranging from a hike in the minimum wage to a program 
of national volunteer service strengthened environmental 
enforcement and widespread affordable health care 
it also called for an expanded commitment to education research 
and development agriculture and trade 
it is not a political platform said the draft that produced 
debate two days in a row at closed party caucuses just off the 
senate floor neither can it include every item of interest to 
every senator or accommodate every difference of emphasis and 
viewpoint 
democrats initially hoped to make a public release of the 
material on friday but officials indicated the date was likely to 
slip past the twoweek easter recess that begins at the end of the 
week they said some changes had been made in the draft a copy of 
which was made available to the associated press but declined to 
discuss them 
sen tom daschle of south dakota who was in charge of the effort 
to produce the agenda said the discussion had been a healthy 
debate that centered in part on the concerns by some senators 
that the draft was short on specifics other senators said democrats 
might try to come up with a second more concrete set of promposals 
later in the year 
the proposed agenda grew out of a commitment by sen george 
mitchell of maine the newly elected majority leader to consult 
widely with other democrats and produce a set of legislative 
guidelines for democrats to adhere to during the twoyear congress 
that convened in january 
mitchell appointed daschle to coordinate the effort and the 
result of daschles conversations with democratic senators was 
reflected in the draft agenda that he and the majority leader 
presented to the 55member democratic caucus on wednesday and 
thursday 
with this report we offer the president our hand said the 
draft we do not expect the administration to accept every item 
we seek only cooperation and progress 
it says that the job for democrats in congress is not to oppose 
the administration automatically but to propose new policies and 
pursue them cooperatively 
the draft agenda committed democrats to ensuring a prosperous 
economy protecting the national security preserving the 
environment and defending essential family values and outlined 
specific legislation to accomplish each of those goals 
but on many of the most contentious issues democrats shied away 
from specifics in their draft it is imperative that we 
significantly reduce budget and trade deficits they said but the 
only two specific steps mentioned for deficit reduction are a demand 
for realistic economic projections and insisting on accurate 
calculations of budget numbers 
when it comes to the faltering savings and loan industry the 
draft agenda called for taking legal action against those who 
committed fraud and abuse and urged unspecified tough new 
regulatory reform

except for one thing deeanne eggleston is a 
lot like hundreds of other adventurous bicyclists planning to ride 
across the country this summer 
the difference is that eggleston is legally blind 
the ride is her attempt to prove to others and maybe to herself 
that people with disabilities should pursue their dreams despite 
risks 
for her that means putting my life on the line in order to 
feel more alive 
ive been called really stupid for doing this people ask why i 
feel i have to do it says the softspoken 38yearold but i 
think thats what life is i cant just be sitting around 
she leaves april 1 and hopes to arrive in washington dc by 
late july 
i see this as a project about the preconceived ideas and 
beliefs about people who are different she said in a telephone 
interview from her home in novato about 30 miles north of san 
francisco 
eggleston will be accompanied by a sighted companion and theyll 
communicate through twoway helmet radios a support car will follow 
the planned route rolls down the pacific coast to los angeles 
then across arizona new mexico texas arkansas tennessee and 
virginia 
along the way she plans to meet with civic leaders speak to 
rotary groups compare notes with other disabled people and she 
hopes create a lasting impression of what the disabled can do 
before she lost her sight a decade ago eggleston a diabetic 
was an athletic graduate student and amateur photographer 
first the disease took away the feeling in her feet then just 
as she was completing requirements for a masters degree in 
psychotherapy she started losing her sight she now has only 6 
percent vision in one eye just enough to distinguish fuzzy shadows 
from light 
i always had a dream of riding a bicycle across the us and a 
dream of taking pictures of people across the united states but 
with school and my career there was never time she said 
her blindness prompted her to question the way id been looking 
at the world 
she first resumed her interest in portrait photography using the 
little sight she has she frames her subject in the viewfinder but 
the photos are intentionally out of focus the idea is to show her 
perception of the world 
if i have a perfectly focused picture its an accident she 
said boasting that many many famous portrait photographers say i 
capture things that others cant 
cycling is a greater challenge she cant feel the pedals with 
her feet she cant see curbs or potholes 
she first prepared herself for months by lifting weights and 
practicing on a stationary bike when she was ready to try riding a 
bicycle last december friends helped her get one in san francisco 
but she waited until after they were gone to get on it 
then she took the mountain bike with 19inch balloon tires onto 
the wide smooth driveway outside her condominium 
i spent about 20 minutes just straddling it before i had the 
nerve to actually put my feet on the pedals and start moving she 
said recalling how frightened she was 
finally she decided to ride in a big circle off she went 
repeating the round path until she realized she was near a curb she 
turned to miss it but almost hit a garage and then my fear was 
real 
since then she says its just been a continuous building up of 
confidence 
she listens carefully for the sound of oncoming traffic she 
makes the most of what sight she has 
she learned wednesday that the woman who will start the trip with 
her will be able to go only as far as dallas but she is confident 
shell be able to find someone to ride with her from there or will 
somehow find the nerve to go it alone 
if we have to end it in dallas therell be some disappointment 
in that she said thursday but to say i went across the country 
on a bicycle really is not what my goal has ever been 
eggleston extended her training routes gradually to the point 
where she now rides between 20 and 45 miles a day by herself on the 
quiet roads around her home 
one day i was heading down a hill and i was picking up speed 
and i was very afraid suddenly i raised my head and felt the wind 
in my face and i felt like i was kissing the wind

two detainees who have been on 
a hunger strike to demand they be freed or put on trial are 
seriously ill but are refusing medical treatment and food lawyers 
said thursday 
the two black activists are among several dozen detainees 
refusing to eat in protest of the 33monthold state of emergency 
measures that allow police to hold people for an undetermined time 
without trial 
sandile thusi 26 marked his 27th day without food thursday and 
was growing weak at a hospital in durban according to his lawyer 
dhaya pillay 
donsie khumalo a labor union official was in extremely

rally in support of the detainees 
a university cannot perform its proper role in society under 
the institutionalized abuse of human rights the vice chancellor 
of the university pd booysen told the crowd 
detainees in johannesburg began the hunger strike jan 23 and as 
many as 500 have participated for varying lengths of time since 
then most strikers resumed eating when law and order minister 
adriaan vlok promised feb 16 to release a substantial number of 
detainees 
vlok said wednesday he has authorized 400 releases leaving about 
400 people in detention antiapartheid groups have questioned the 
figures and accused vlok of reneging on his pledge 
many of those released have been placed under tight restrictions 
that limit their movements and activities 
an estimated 30000 people almost all black have been detained 
for varying lengths of time since the government imposed the 
emergency regulations which give security forces wide powers and 
ban most forms of peaceful protest 
in another development a political activist who has been in 
hiding for three years turned himself in to authorities thursday 
police had sought johnny issel for alleged violations of the 
countrys internal security act which covers a wide range of

the chief architect of the bush 
administrations debtreduction initiative estimated wednesday that 
the plan could cut the total debt owed by 39 third world countries 
by about 20 percent over the next three years 
the estimate by assistant treasury secretary david mulford during 
congressional testimony was the first public acknowledgement by the 
administration of the scope of its new initiative which was 
unveiled last week by treasury secretary nicholas brady 
the administrations effort which represents a major switch in 
us policy got the endorsement thursday of federal reserve 
chairman alan greenspan who issued a statement expressing full 
support for the principles behind bradys proposal 
however many members of congress remained unsatisfied with both 
the amount of detail the administration was willing to provide and 
also with major elements of the administrations debtforgiveness 
proposal 
while praising president bush for at least doing more than the 
reagan administration democrats in both the senate and house 
charged that the bush initiative lacked the boldness needed to solve 
the pressing problems of poverty that have engulfed latin america in 
a new wave of political and economic instability 
we need more sen alan dixon dill told mulford more 
details more careful thinking and bolder international 
initiatives 
but mulford who testified before a senate banking subcommittee 
and later to a house banking subcommittee asked members of congress 
to give the plan a chance to work 
he said that the plans initial success could be determined by 
the first week in april when the 151nation world bank and 
international monetary fund meet in washington to discuss third 
world debt matters 
after the reagan administration refused for years to endorse any 
broadbased efforts at debt forgiveness the bush administration has 
now put forward a plan that encourages banks to voluntarily forgive 
part of the debt owed to them by third world countries 
the brady plan as it was being called during the hearings moves 
away from the socalled 1985 baker plan named for bradys 
predecessor at treasury and now secretary of state james a baker 
iii 
mulford said that the brady proposal projected a possible 20 
percent reduction in the debt owed by 39 third world countries and 
an additional 20 percent reduction in the amount of debt interest 
payments these countries would be required to make over the next 
three years 
the 39 developing countries which include the largest debtor 
nations and many of the smaller ones collectively owe 340 billion 
a 20 percent reduction in that debt over three years would total 70 
billion with another 20 billion in relief coming from a 20 percent 
reduction in the estimated 102 billion in interest payments these 
countries would be required to make over the next three years 
mulford stressed that these projections were only rough estimates 
and would vary widely from country to country 
a country like mexico generally considered a good debtor 
nation because it has strived to implement necessary economic 
reforms could considerably exceed the 20 percent estimate 
mulford said 
on the other hand he said that some countries might realize no 
debt reduction at all if they fail to implement needed economic 
reforms 
it is very important not to get pinned down on a specific set 
of numbers because numbers invariably raise expectations or depress 
expectations depending on ones point of view mulford said 
he was responding to questions concerning a report in thursdays 
wall street journal which said the treasury department estimates 
had been provided privately in meetings with representatives of 
commercial banks 
several members of congress expressed qualms that the brady plan 
did not go far enough in providing debt relief especially in latin 
america where living standards have been falling since the debt 
crisis first erupted seven years ago 
sen bob graham dfla said the flood of refugees and illegal 
drugs into the united states was directly related to the growing 
poverty in the region he said the only surprise in the 
debttriggered riots which left 300 dead two weeks ago was that they 
occurred in venezuela one of the most prosperous countries in the 
region 
the brady plan was endorsed thursday by greenspan whose 
statement was issued after several reports of a behindthescenes 
battle between the federal reserve and the administration over the 
proposal 
in his statement greenspan said i fully support the 
principles put forward by secretary brady last friday for helping 
the heavily indebted countries to resolve their economic and 
financial problems the challenge ahead for all of us is to 
reinvigorate the process and ensure that it works 
as part of his testimony mulford also released several reports 
saying the administration opposed establishing an international 
agency to facilitate the writing off of debt 
he said that the resources of the imf and world bank were 
sufficient to handle the problem and a new agency was not needed 
under the brady plan both organizations would support direct 
debt relief and would provide guarantees covering the reduced debt 
remaining after the writeoffs

andersons captivity as a hostage in lebanon 
threeandahalf years ago at the beginning of our struggle to 
make the world aware that there were hostages being held in lebanon 
father martin jenco and terry anderson lay chained and blindfolded 
scant feet from william buckley

to use the toilet he died before the horrified eyes of his fellow 
hostages and once again the world stood silent 
today we know that of the nine american hostages being held 
one has gone mad and another has twice attempted suicide two 
hostages tried to escape and were beaten senseless by their captors 
terry anderson has pounded his head against the dirty stone wall of 
his cell until the blood ran frustrated angry lonely and tired of 
being caged like an animal he finally broke 
how long will america stand silent in the face of this 
abomination how long will their fellow americans debate and discuss 
what if anything should be done to free these innocent men while 
they waste away and some go mad and some die and we still continue 
to debate and discuss 
this is not or should not be a political issue this is a human 
rights issue a humanitarian concern a crime against humanity in 
the words of un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar and 
still we discuss and debate and some die and some go mad 
enough is enough i say no more debate no more discussion our 
message to their captors to president bush and to the world must be 
that simple enough is enough in the words of terry anderson this 
cannot continue i say again this cannot continue enough for 
gods sake enough

federal health officials sought thursday to 
calm growing public fear over the consumption of apples by children 
telling congress that pesticide levels on apples pose no imminent 
hazard to preschoolers 
some senators said the uproar over the use of the chemical alar 
on apples and its health effects on small children has produced an 
apple scare that threatens the industry from new york to washington 
state 
the apple market is dead as a doornail right now across 
america said sen steven symms ridaho whose family is in the 
apple business other senators said they now hesitate to give apple 
products to their own children 
many apple growers and processors say their apples are free of 
alar which has been linked to cancer in animal tests but large 
numbers of parents are reported to have stopped giving apples to 
their children since a private environmental group said youngsters 
were especially at risk from the chemical because they eat more 
apples and apple products than adults 
school districts in los angeles chicago new york san 
francisco miami and elsewhere have stopped providing apples in 
school cafeterias since the report by the natural resources defense 
council gained widespread publicity last month 
at a senate subcommittee hearing on the apple controversy sen 
john warner rva urged the bush administration to exercise some 
crisis control because apple growers even those who do not use 
alar are being hurt and parents are confused by conflicting 
information 
three federal agencies the food and drug administration 
environmental protection agency and agriculture department issued 
a joint statement urging parents and school officials to continue 
providing children apples and apple products saying there is no 
imminent hazard posed to children in the consumption of apples at 
this time despite claims to the contrary 
the federal government believes that it is safe for americans 
to eat apples said the statement 
fda administrator frank young reminded senators that earlier this 
week he moved swiftly to direct chilean fruit off grocery shelves 
after traces of cyanide were found in two imported grapes he 
declared he would do the same if he thought apples were a danger to 
children 
in miami meanwhile the president of a food industry group said 
monetary losses from the two fruit scares will probably be felt 
all through the system 
robert aders president of the food marketing institute said 
is it going to lay on the producers or the consumers my guess is 
its going to be shared 
young said that of 800 apple samples tested by the fda for alar 
since 1981 the highest residue levels found were 8 parts per 
million which is less than half the 20 parts per million allowed by 
the epa 
there is not a significant risk at this time facing the 
american people in the consumption of apples said young adding 
at another point that dramatic action by consumers such as 
withholding apples from their children is not warranted there 
does not appear to be a need for panic 
james moore acting deputy epa administrator said any suggestion 
that there is a massive public health problem from pesticides on 
fruits and that children are gravely at risk is simply untrue 
moore in his testimony criticized the private studys risk 
estimates as not being scientifically sound and said the report has 
caused misinformation and fear among parents and school 
officials 
nevertheless he told the senate subcommittee on children 
families drug abuse and alcoholism that he favors getting alar off 
the market and that if the chemical were newly introduced it would 
not be approved the epa announced earlier in the year it was 
seeking to have alar removed from production but the process could 
take three years 
sen brock adams rwash suggested that uniroyal inc the 
manufacturer of alar would do us all a public service if they 
suspended production of the product because the controversy is 
harming the apple industry uniroyal has disputed preliminary epa 
findings that daminozide as alar is technically called causes 
cancer 
adams said most growers in washington state do not use 
daminozide but there was no agreement among witnesses as to how 
widespread the use of the chemical actually is 
young said the fda has concluded that about 10 percent of the 
apples are sprayed with alar but the epa has cited a figure of 
about 5 percent 
actress meryl streep who has been in the forefront of the 
campaign against alar and is a leader of mothers and others for 
pesticide limits questioned whether anyone knows the extent of the 
danger from alar and other pesticides on food products 
i think what we dont know about this issue is whats so 
alarming ms streep the mother of three small children said

university researchers in massachusetts 
pennsylvania and michigan reported results of two separate 
experiments thursday which could someday lead to new drugs to use 
against cancer 
university of michigan researchers reported what they said was 
the first stimulation of the immune system in mucouslined tissues 
against a cancercausing chemical 
this could lead to inoculations that could keep some 
cancercausing chemicals and toxins from being absorbed by the body 
a team from harvard university and the university of 
pennsylvania reported tests of a complex compound that when given 
with certain steroid drugs is up to 1000 times more powerful than 
current drugs in inhibiting the growth of small capillary blood 
vessels that tumors need for growth 
without the steroids the compound is a powerful stimulator of 
capillary growth which is necessary for ovulation menstruation and 
growth of the placenta in women and wound repair in both sexes 
whether suppressing capillary growth is a fruitful anticancer 
strategy has to await safe and effective suppressors the 
harvardpennsylvania group said 
both reports were published in the issue of science magazine 
which is published friday 
many body tissues exposed to the outside environment are lined 
with mucous particularly the nose and mouth 
if those tissues are invaded by a virus a bacterially produced 
toxin or similar agent which might produce a cold or other illness 
they secrete antibodies if the virus reappears the antibodies bind 
to it and prevent its absorption as is believed to happen with the 
viruses that cause colds 
vaccines such as the sabin oral polio vaccine work in part by 
priming this secretory immune system one of several in the body to 
generate antibodies 
but ordinary chemical molecules are generally too small to elicit 
such a response 
at the university of michigan lawrence k silbart a 
toxicologist who is a research fellow in pathology and david f 
keren professor of pathology bound a powerful cause of cancer in 
laboratory animals 2acetylaminofluorene or aaf to the toxin 
produced by the choleracausing bacterium vibrio cholerae 
they measured absorption into the bloodstream of a radioactive 
derivative of the aaftoxin complex across the membrane of the 
intestines of rabbits immunized with the complex and compared that 
with the absorption of the same substance in a control group of 
rabbits immunized with an unrelated toxin absorption of aaf into 
the blood was more than twice in the control group as it was in the 
test group 
the article said the results suggest that oral vaccines against 
carcinogens and toxicants could be developed for humans 
as to the absorption after immunization ideally wed like to 
eliminate it completely said keren in an interview in nature 
youre going to be exposed to chronic low doses and you might see 
reductions of a factor of 100 or so 
this is the first hard evidence that you can make the secretory 
immune response and that it can interfere with absorption of 
the carcinogen but many years of work are needed to produce a 
useful vaccine he said 
the harvardpennsylvania team led by judah folkman professor of 
surgery at the harvard medical school noted that heparin a complex 
chemical used as an anticoagulant drug has been found to promote 
capillary growth by itself and to inhibit that growth when combined 
with certain steroids 
not all investigators have been able to find the anticapillary 
effect and the harvardpennsylvania team wrote that potent 
inhibition of angiogenesis capillary formation and growth is 
also subject to the variable activity of different heparin 
preparations 
those preparations have been nonuniform and heterogeneous in 
composition molecular size structure position of subtituents and 
sequence this heterogeneity probably accounts for the variability 
in findings of the effects of heparin 
the team used betacyclodextrin tetradecasulfate a 
doughnutshaped compound made up of seven repeating units of a 
substance called glucopyranose with two sulfate groups attached to 
each unit 
the hole in the doughnut is necessary to carry the steroid 
drug to the surface of the target cells the investigators theorized 
tested in chick embryos and rabbit corneas the activity of 
betacyclodestrin tetradecasulfate showed vesselsuppressing 
activity 100 to 1000 times that of commercially available 
heparin fully reproducible from one preparation to another 
in the corneas the substance used with cortexolone decreased 
vessel growth to 18 percent of that of untreated control eyes 
measured according to vessel length and to 8 percent according to 
the density of blood vessels by itself betacyclodestrin 
tetradecasulfate stimulated vessel length to 164 percent of 
untreated controls

the government said thursday that a 
triple disaster of floods an earthquake and a cyclone has left at 
least 80000 people homeless in this landlocked southern african 
country and perhaps as many as 110000 
freak winds wrecked the homes of about 24000 people ripping 
roofs off buildings uprooting trees and flattening crops in the 
northern district of karonga on the shores of lake malawi a 
government spokesman said 
reports of the cyclone reached blantyre as the government mounted 
a rescue operation to resettle 56000 people in central and southern 
districts hit by floods and an earthquake that razed houses already 
weakened by floodwaters 
falling masonry crushed two people to death in the earthquake on 
friday and six others were reported drowned in the flooding 
the spokesman who by custom was not identified said the cyclone 
struck several days ago but no reports of casualties had been 
received from local administrators in karonga 
he said the state national disaster preparedness committee was 
waiting for more information from remote areas before making an 
international appeal for emergency aid 
he said efforts were being made to verify reports that an 
additional 30000 people lost their homes livestock and crops in 
flooding in remote areas over the last 10 days 
on tuesday the goverment said it began a rescue operation using 
canoes and motor launches to evacuate tens of thousands of people 
left homeless by flooding in the central and southern districts of 
nchala chikwawa and nsanje 
torrential rain cut roads and a rail line swept away mudbuilt 
villages and created an 50mile lake at nsanje near the 
southeastern border with mozambique 
about 600000 refugees have fled into southern malawi to escape 
the conflict between government forces and rebels in mozambque 
many refugees are believed to have been affected by the prolonged 
seasonal rains 
the earthquake damaged the homes of 800 people at salima about 
225 miles north of blantyre in central malawi

scientists at the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration have completed a study of world rainfall 
over the last century creating a new standard by which to measure 
the greenhouse effect 
what this gives us is a baseline said maurice blackmon noaa 
climatological research director of the fiveyear study scheduled 
for release friday 
if youve got some major deviation bigger than anything else 
that has been observed youd have to start looking for some new 
kind of variable such as the greenhouse effect 
the study shows that precipitation has decreased over parts of 
the northern hemisphere and increased in the southern hemisphere 
over the past century 
rainfall in northern hemisphere areas south of 30 degrees 
latitude regions such as mexico central america and 
droughtridden north africa decreased by about 20 percent the 
study found rainfall in the southern hemisphere rose about 5 
percent 
the findings are consistent with theories of the greenhouse 
effect a suspected global warming due to a steady buildup of about 
4 percent a year of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse 
gases since the era of heavy industry began 
the study predicts temperature increases of up to 5 degrees and 
fluctuations in rainfall near the equator over the next 50 years 
but atmospheric scientists emphasized that rainfall trends 
observed in the study dont prove the greenhouse effect is at work 
global environmental changes can only be measured over a period 
of years said henry diaz who studied records from more than 
2000 weather stations we cannot tell whether the climate is 
changing by looking at the weather each year to detect change in 
climate you need many decades 
blackmon said it was possible that fluctuations over the last 
century were due to a recurring kind of anomaly not related to the 
greenhouse effect 
but he added if it the warming lasts another ten years it 
would be unprecedented 
in 10 years unfortunately it will be too late to do much about 
the problem said michael schlesinger the oregon state university 
atmospheric scientist who developed a model for predicting effects 
of global warming

the us marshals service said thursday a 
critical audit commissioned by attorney general dick thornburgh 
didnt accurately represent the agencys operations 
us marshals service spokesman stephen boyle said the finding 
that the agencys financial management system was only marginally 
adequate was not supported by the specific findings in the 
report 
that language is taken from their coversheet their 
generalization of their findings boyle said 
he said the study actually found that files and paperwork were 
not located in a form or fashion the auditors thought was 
desirable 
that didnt suggest there was anything unaccounted for boyle 
said 
neither boyle nor the justice department would release the audit 
which was disclosed in the washington post 
but boyle offered a point by point rebuttal of the findings 
reported in the post saying to the extent that the auditors 
found nothing to suggest failure in meeting our operational 
requirements nothing suggesting fraud or misuse of funds is a very 
positive result 
an audit is an exercise to find fault they found fault but 
what they found we think was of minimal signficance to our principal 
mission he said 
we consider the entire audit a declaration that the marshals 
service is in extremely good shape except for the fact that some of 
the auditors who did the audit would like to see us with a larger 
bureaucracy 
boyle cited a finding that the agencys procurement staff still 
had not begun efforts recoup overcharges by private security firms 
that were uncovered in a 1987 audit 
the staff responsible for collecting the money overcharged by 
security firms in eight judicial disticts had postponed that effort 
while renegotiating contracts with private contractors hired to 
guard courthouses and prisons 
its not as matter of the money disappearing boyle said 
the bills are in hand we simply have to devote the contracts 
personnel to go back and pursue the collections which we will be 
doing 
a finding that several of the agencys small airplanes used for 
hauling prisoners were not designed for that purpose was a 
particularly good example of the auditors reflecting bad 
information boyle said 
seven of the 13 small planes are being refurbished so they can be 
used to transport prisoners boyle said the federal aviation 
administration gave the marshals service the surplus aircraft last 
year he said 
the audit also found the marshals service has not conducted 
adequate background checks of people hired to protect courthouses or 
guard prisoners 
boyle said private security firms are responsible for checking 
the backgrounds of guards it furnishes under contracts offduty 
policemen hired to guard prisoners in hospitals are usually provided 
by local police departments he said 
it isnt a matter of people walking in off the street in police 
uniforms he said the gaurds are hired as result of formal 
contacts with official representatives of local police departments 
the audit also found the agency once leased an airplane for 
10000 to transport director stanley e morris and two other people 
from washington to oklahoma city after a marshals service plane 
broke down 
boyle said the plane was leased because morris and seven other 
senior officials could not have traveled by commercial airlines in 
time to attend the ceremony

the government lost money on timber sales in 
more than twothirds of the nations 120 national forests during 
fiscal 1988 but still recorded an overall profit of 3887 million 
the forest service said thursday 
in its second annual accounting of the costs and benefits of 
national forest timber sales the forest service said its timber 
sales program made a profit of 4422 million in 46 national 
forests mostly in the california washington oregon arizona new 
mexico and the parts of southeast 
the logging program in the other 74 national forests lost a total 
of 537 million officials said more than 80 percent of the 126 
billion board feet of timber harvested from national forests was 
taken from forests where revenues exceeded expenses 
peter m emerson chief economist and vice president for resource 
planning and economics for the wilderness society said the report 
reinforces the societys view that the forest services timber sales 
program is an environmentally destructive federal boondoggle 
the wilderness society has been urging the forest service for 
several years to halt timber sales in national forests where 
expenses exceed revenue the society contends that logging 
activities in such forests usually are the most damaging to the 
environment since the trees tend to be located in the most 
unapproachable areas 
in the rugged southern appalachian national forests for example 
the forest service said it lost 834 million on timber sales in 
fiscal 1988 an increase of 156 million from the previous year

a senate committee on thursday approved 
legislation that would allow oil exploration in the arctic national 
wildlife refuge but no drilling leases until after a 
governmentfinanced study considering alternative energy sources 
the senate energy and natural resources committee defeated an 
amendment offered by sens timothy wirth dcolo and dale bumpers 
dark that would have delayed any possibility of oil exploration 
until a comprehensive energy conservation plan was submitted to 
congress by the interior secretary 
the energy plan language the committee accepted was presented by 
sen mark hatfield rore and is identical to a compromise 
included in the same legislation last session 
while the previous bill also passed the energy committee it 
failed to get to either the house or senate floor for a vote the 
house has not taken up the measure yet this session 
opponents say the united states needs to have a plan for saving 
energy and finding alternatives to fossil fuel before it starts 
drilling for more oil especially in a part of the country that is 
the breeding ground for one of the largest herds of migrating 
caribou in north america and home to many other forms of wildlife 
supporters say oil exploration is necessary for national security 
the closest weve come to nuclear war is in the middle east to 
protect our oil supply said hatfield 
but he also spoke of a need for conservation saying no matter 
what the actual oil find in alaska our national energy needs will 
require the development of alternative sources of energy the 
spotlight trained on energy conservation efforts during the late 
70s and early 80s has suffered a blackout 
his amendment requires the departments of interior and energy 
the council on environmental quality and the national academy of 
sciences to prepare a national energy plan within 15 months after 
the bill is enacted 
the plan must consider all potential energy sources and projected 
energy demands bids for oil leases could be taken while the study 
was under way but no leases could be granted until congress had had 
six months to study the report 
the amendment also requires that the energy secretary establish a 
grant program to promote research development and marketing of 
conservation techniques and alternative fuels this program would 
get its money from the sale of oil found in the refuge 
sen bennett johnston dla called the bumperswirth proposal 
a killer amendment because it not only said oil exploration must 
be delayed until the energy plan was established but that pursuing 
oil exploration would take another act of congress 
the american petroleum institute applauded the passage of the 
bill saying the refuge may provide as much as 1 million barrels of 
oil to the united states every day for as long as 30 years 
the institute said more than 6 billion barrels have been produced 
at prudhoe bay since 1977 when drilling began there another 3 
billion barrels are still believed to be available from prudhoe 
oil companies want to start drilling at the refuge which is just 
east of prudhoe so that oil will continue to flow from alaska when 
the fields in prudhoe are dry

an official of the plo on thursday welcomed 
what he said were encouraging signs of a new willingness by the 
united states to meet palestinian demands for a middle east 
settlement 
nabil shaath an adviser to palestine liberation organization 
leader yasser arafat cited remarks made this week by secretary of 
state james a baker iii and other developments 
the last three days show a lot of progress small progress 
but important significant progress many people are so skeptical 
they are not even willing to see that progress 
the future is going to come up with all kinds of surprises for 
all of us happy surprises shaath told reporters at the national 
press club 
baker on tuesday told a house subcommittee that if talks between 
israel and nonplo palestinians do not prosper i suppose we would 
then have to see negotiations between israelis and representatives 
of the plo 
the next day however he told the senate appropriations 
subcommittee on foreign operations that an israeliplo dialogue was 
difficult to foresee but should not categorically be ruled out 
shaath one of three plo officials who attended a seminar in new 
york last weekend has been meeting with private groups in 
washington and was seeing at least two members of congress 
he said that he had had no contact with us officials during his 
visit but that he took heart from bakers remarks 
so far there has been very little substance said shaath 
but he said that talks between the plo and the united states 
would resume march 22 in tunis and that the plo had been assured 
us ambassador robert h pelletreau would be able to discuss 
substantive issues he said these would include the palestinians 
demands for the right to selfdetermination and for a palestinian 
state 
shaath said that president bush had told egyptian president hosni 
mubarak in tokyo last month that the usplo talks in tunis would 
become substantive weve had assurance in tokyo in the meeting 
that president mubarak held with president bush where they discussed 
really nothing but the palestinian question shaath said mr 
bush committed himself to mr mubarak then that the dialogue would 
be resumed and would be made substantive and we learn now that this 
is going to be the case on the 22nd 
i think we are very close to us recognition of the 
palestinian right to selfdetermination shaath said 
shaath said he wasnt discouraged by israeli foreign minister 
moshe arens criticism of bakers initial remarks or arens 
hardline rejection of talks with the plo 
shaath said the israelis would not be able to ignore the 
palestinian uprising or intifadeh and would have to come to 
terms with palestinian demands 
meanwhile the united states citing latest battles in beirut 
urged the arab league on thursday to continue its reconciliation 
attempts between moslems and christians in lebanon 
the united states government is deeply concerned over the heavy 
exchange of shelling and consequent loss of life in eight days of 
warfare which have left 49 people dead said state department 
spokesman charles redman 
we urge all sides to exercise restraint and to avoid civilian 
casualties at all costs he said 
we call on general aoun and doctor hoss to cooperate and 
coordinate directly with one another to work together to restore 
and invigorate lebanons legitimate national institutions redman 
said 
michel aoun heads a christian military cabinet that has been 
vying for legitimacy with a rival moslem cabinet under acting prime 
minister salim hoss since president amin gemayels term ended sept 
22 
minutes before stepping down gemayel named aoun to head an 
interim military cabinet but his appointment was rejected by 
leftists and moslems who declared allegiance to hoss 
redman said the latest fighting threatens to destroy the arab 
leagues peace initiative in lebanon 
the united states actively supports this initiative and 
encourages the arab league to continue its effort he said

black women are spending twice as many years 
living without a spouse than white women at least in part because 
they believe they have less financial incentive to get married or 
stay married a researcher says 
an ongoing study of the economic and other disparities between 
races determined that black women are catching up financially with 
black men at a rate much faster than the pay of white women is 
approaching that of white men 
the researcher university of michigan sociology professor 
reynolds farley said one obvious reason for that is that wages paid 
black men lag well behind those paid white men 
still he said black women often develop the perception it is 
not in their best financial interest to get or stay married and 
because of that they are waiting longer than white women to marry 
and are divorcing more frequently 
black women when they look around and think about getting 
married see that the pool of black men with high earnings is 
relatively small farley said in a telephone interview wednesday 
this gives them less of a financial incentive to get married or to 
remain married 
another reseacher interviewed thursday did not dispute farleys 
finding but said the underlying factor behind it was most likely 
years of wage discrimination against black men that has resulted in 
black women having a longer tradition of having to work than white 
women because of that black women have a greater sense of 
financial independence even if their wages are lower than those 
paid white women said phyllis palmer director of the womens 
studies program at george washington university 
i think its true that black mens low income affects the 
marriage rate of black women palmer said but its overly 
cynical to say money is the only thing that gets one married 
farley said that in 1987 30 percent of black women between the 
ages of 1544 were living with a husband compared with 52 percent 
in 1960 and 70 percent in 1950 fiftyfive percent of white women in 
that age bracket were living with a husband in 1987 down from 69 
percent in 1960 and 70 percent in 1950 
several studies have noted complaints by black women that there 
is a shortage of black males in the marriage pool but farley said 
that when numbers alone are considered those complaints are 
unfounded 
there have been nearly equal numbers of black men and women 
within each age group since the 1970s so there is not an absolute 
shortage of black men he said however the persistently high 
unemployment rate and limited earnings of black men may lead some 
black women to delay marriage and correspondingly some black men 
may hesitate to take on the financial obligations of a family 
data from 197580 indicate that black women on average will spend 
16 years of their 73year life span with a spouse while white women 
can expect to spend 33 of their expected 77 years with a mate 
farley said 
higher homicide and incarceration rates among blacks likely 
contribute to those numbers palmer said 
farleys data were compiled as part of a larger study he is 
conducting to determine why civil rights programs designed to bring 
blacks and other minorities on an equal economic footing with whites 
have failed to do so 
working with data from the census bureau and other sources 
reynolds determined that the average annual earnings of black women 
and white women are close 13800 for black women in 1987 and 
14700 for white women 
but earnings of black women are much closer to those of black 
men who made 18500 in 1987 while white women still lag well 
behind white men who made 28000 in 1987 
relative to the incomes of their potential mates black women 
are doing better than white women farley said

his sexuality and proclaimed im a heterosexual 
and the mayor said thursday he wouldnt mind if the topic boosts 
the sales of his latest book his eminence and hizzoner 
if you buy that book you may ultimately be giving a gift to 
the city of new york in aggregate of maybe a million dollars 
koch said so if i have piqued your interest rush out and buy 
the book 
koch and his coauthor cardinal john j oconnor are donating 
their book profits to charities 
the flap began wednesday night when an interviewer on wmca radio 
discussing the difference between kochs and oconnors views on 
homosexuality remarked you yourself have been the subject of 
innuendo 
i happen to believe that theres nothing wrong with 
homosexuality its whatever god made you it happens that im a 
heterosexual koch said 
koch previously has said that he is not a homosexual and that he 
once had a girlfriend but he noted in the current book that he has 
been the subject of scurrilous rumors and gossip in political 
campaigns 
in 1977 when he was running for mayor against mario cuomo 
posters appeared around the city which read vote for cuomo not 
the homo 
he wrote so i took the public position that i would not 
respond to such an inquiry ever again people could think whatever 
they wanted to my sexuality just like my religion is a private 
matter i dont have to account to anyone for it 
at the news conference koch said he had forgotten that i had 
said i would never discuss this subject again and i never will as 
of today 
when asked whether the statement was intended to remove sexual 
preference as a potential campaign issue in the next mayoral 
election koch replied that happens to be wrong he had no 
further comment

premier andreas papandreou on thursday 
accepted the resignations of all 54 ministers in his cabinet 
preparing for a government shakeup in a political crisis over a 
bank scandal 
the socialist government also proposed a law allowing more 
representation for smaller parties and raising the parliamentary 
majority required to form a government making governing coalitions 
more likely 
the main conservative party said the law is aimed at keeping it 
out of power 
the cabinet reshuffle will be the second since the 200 million 
fraud forgery and embezzlement scandal involving a fugitive greek 
banker broke five months ago leading to the resignations of eight 
cabinet ministers 
it will also be papandreous 16th cabinet reshuffle in eight 
years 
government sources indicated papandreou intends to use the 
reshuffle to purge the socialist government of ministers implicated 
in the scandal and attract waning support for his governing 
panhellenic socialist movement pasok 
papandreous party has come under heavy fire for its handling of 
the bank of crete scandal in which papandreou and senior government 
officials have been accused of taking payoffs 
a statement issued by government spokesman sotiris kostopoulos 
said the new cabinet would be appointed and sworn in friday 
the draft electoral law is to be submitted to parliament on 
friday and lawmakers are to vote on it within the next few weeks 
the main conservative opposition new democracy party accused the 
government of trying to hamper its efforts to win a clear majority 
in the upcoming june elections 
the government has admitted that it has ceased to contest power 
and its exclusive concern is how to prevent us from acquiring an 
overall majority new democracy leader constantine mitsotakis said 
in a statement 
interior minister akis tsochatzopoulos said the proposed 
electoral law would allow smaller parties to have more seats in the 
300member singlechamber parliament 
according to kostopoulos the premier asked his ministers to 
resign in order to go ahead with the reshuffle 
all the ministers have been asked and verbally submitted their 
resignations the spokesman said 
bankerpublisher george koskotas 34 was indicted in the scandal 
and fled greece on nov 6 he was arrested in the united states 
where he is jailed awaiting a decision on extradition requested by 
greece 
the banker has alleged that papandreou and other senior socialist 
officials received millions of dollars in payoffs and authorized 
plans to loot millions from the bank of crete while he was its 
chairman 
the draft bill proposes a new proportional system for electing 
deputies and increases the margin needed to elect a government from 
45 percent of the vote the previous level to about 48 percent an 
electoral analyst said 
the analyst said on condition of anonymity that the new law would 
open the way for coalition governments 
under the countrys present reinforced proportional system large 
political parties are heavily favored in seat distributions 
in the 1985 elections the system gave pasok 458 percent of the 
vote and 161 seats new democracy received 408 percent and 126 the 
greek communist party got 989 percent and 12 seats and the 
eurocommunists polled 184 percent and one seat 
political defections have left pasok with 154 the conservatives 
with 111 and the communists with nine the eurocommunists retain 
their one seat and the rest are independents

as boston rolled out a green carpet for st 
patricks day some irish natives were grappling with immigration 
woes and a feeling that america has not been very hospitable of late 
with all the irish names and the festivities and the shamrocks 
and shillelaghs i find it ironic that irish people are living in 
the shadows here like fugitives john dillon a spokesman for the 
irish immigration reform movement said thursday 
while bostonians were preparing green beer and green bagels the 
us immigration and naturalization service raided four businesses 
suspected of employing illegal aliens ten irish natives were 
arrested on charges of being illegal immigrants 
ins officials said tuesdays arrests of four men at a 
construction site in hanover nh and six women in a raid on a 
suburban quincy restaurant were purely coincidental and not part of 
a coordinated sweep 
we dont enforce the law by holiday or nationality said ins 
district director charles t cobb it just happened 
but several irish immigrants and irishamericans said the ins 
timing showed bad taste 
it doesnt show a whole lot of sensitivity said doris 
cadigan who emigrated from county cork to natick in 1971 nobody 
wants to be illegal it brings out an attitude that these people 
have done something wrong 
it could be interpreted as a calculated insult to the irish 
community but im sure it wasnt intended that way patrick 
hurley a founder of the iirm said in a telephone interview from 
the groups new york office one of 16 pushing for relaxing 
immigration restrictions concerning the irish 
cobb said that about 50 to 60 irish natives were charged with 
immigration law violations last year estimates from the ins and 
other sources put the population of illegal immigrants in boston at 
between 15000 and 25000 people us reps brian donnelly 
dmass and howard berman dcalif have sponsored visa programs 
that will permit 60000 new immigrants by 1991 from 37 countries 
including ireland that have been underrepresented in the past 
cobb said 
of the 10000 visas issued since 1986 under donnellys bill 
about 4700 went to people from ireland he said 
but the lawyer representing the women arrested at the quincy 
restaurant said us immigration policy still favors asians and 
central and south americans who can claim political persecution 
while penalizing the irish and other europeans 
the immigration laws in this country are such that the irish 
immigrants do not have an equal chance of achieving legal status 
said george mcmahon who said his clients would aggressively fight 
deportation its outandout discrimination 
hurley called it hypocritical for america to be celebrating the 
irish contribution while excluding people who are continuing that 
very same tradition 
still doris cadigan notes that tradition and the hoopla it 
inspires can be a bit bewildering to irish natives 
in ireland celebrations are quieter and less commercial with 
people wearing fresh shamrock sprigs and attending church rather 
than parading and displaying plastic leprechauns cadigan said 
when i came over first i was a little offended by it because 
st patrick is very dear to us because he brought us the catholic 
faith cadigan said now i have learned even to drink green beer 
if it is offered to me

rep ted weiss dny said thursday he was 
concerned that surgeon general c everett koop appears to have 
misstated the extent of evaluation that went into koops decision 
not to issue a report on the health effects of abortion 
at a hearing of the government operations subcommittee on human 
resources weiss and other members of the panel questioned koop for 
more than two hours mostly about koops conclusion that there is 
insufficient scientific and statistical evidence on which to base 
an unimpeachable report 
the report had been requested by former president reagan but in 
a jan 9 letter to the thenpresident koop said 250 studies dealing 
with the psychological aspects of abortion have been reported in 
scientific literature 
he said in the letter that all of these studies were reviewed 
and the more significant studies were evaluated by staff in several 
of the agencies of the public health service and were found to 
be flawed methodologically 
in their view and mine the data do not support the premise 
that abortion does or does not cause or contribute to psychological 
problems his letter said 
however under questioning koop acknowledged that only a report 
by a prolife group received written evaluations by reviewers and 
that all other studies referred to health service experts for review 
were only discussed orally 
i am disturbed by what seems to be a conclusive statement based 
on evaluations of studies which turn out not to have been 
reduced to writing that were discussed orally whatever that 
means said weiss chairman of the panel 
koop who is a staunch abortion foe said he reviewed some of the 
articles himself but he said could not detail how much time he 
spent on the task but he said as examples of flawed 
methodologies most of the studies looked at only a short period of 
time after abortion from three to six months 
i know very well from my own experience that many of the 
problems that do occur after abortions occur at a considerable 
time after abortion he said 
i know that women many times for a period that seems 
inordinately long to me have apparently no reaction adversely to 
the psychological effects of abortion and then something triggers it 
in their mind and they become severely depressed or anxious or 
sometimes incapable of carrying on their work he said 
but koop said scientific data is lacking on the topic 
prolife groups maintain that many women who have abortions 
suffer many years later from a stress disorder similar to that 
suffered by vietnam war veterans 
weiss also said he was concerned about allegations made by a 
former centers for disease control scientist who said his work at 
the public health service center in atlanta was censored 
david a grimes now a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at 
the university of southern california school of medicine told the 
subcommittee he left the atlanta facility in the summer of 1986 
after twice having papers he was having published censored 
because of their references to abortion

the small birthmark on newborn faye 
watlings left cheek grew so large so fast her parents sometimes 
feared waking her in the morning for fear theyd see the deformity 
had spread across her entire face 
but jayne and brian watling said doctors in the skelmersdale 
england area where they live warned that corrective surgery had to 
wait until faye turned 7 despite the danger that delay could 
destroy the sight in her left eye 
news about pioneering laser surgery being done in similar cases 
with children at the palo alto medical clinic gave them hope for 
their daughter who turns 2 on march 24 
and a series of heartwarming albeit wacky fundraising stunts 
on fayes behalf gave them the money for the series of operations 
which climaxed on thursday when dr david apfelberg used a laser to 
cut away the bulk of the orangesized tumor called a hemangioma 
after surgery at stanford university faye was wrapped in a head 
bandage covering her face 
shes dressed up like an egyptian mummy watling said from 
his daughters side in the recovery room but the growth is gone 
theres no growth there anymore 
and how did faye deal with the experience 
i dont think she understands too well watling said all 
she knows is that any time someone in white comes near her it 
hurts 
additional reconstructive surgery can be done in another six 
months or so apfelberg said adding that shes always going to 
have some residual 
later surgery will be required to reconstruct the left side of 
fayes face and cover the scar 
about one in every 500 to 800 children have some form of 
birthmark apfelberg said although 90 percent disappear by the age 
of 6 to 8 the cause is unknown he said although it probably 
occurs during the first three months of pregnancy when a fetus 
develops its facial features 
but the doctor said fayes hemangioma which at one point almost 
completely covered her left eye is one of the most severe that 
weve seen 
british doctors lack the technology and training for the laser 
procedures pioneered and developed at the palo alto clinic in the 
1970s apfelberg said 
mrs watling said that when she heard about the california 
techniques she and her sister maureen gledhill immediately began 
looking for ways to collect the 425000 necesssary for the surgery 
and other treatments 
from that point she said things snowballed 
british sailors in the middle of the atlantic chipped in 
longhaired women staged public headshaving exhibitions in exchange 
for donations and inmates in a local prison played 24hour badminton 
games the prison warden had himself locked up for 24 hours while 
other officials staged a mock breakout and women prisoners gave fay 
money they had saved to buy a vcr american airlines donated airfare 
for the familys trips to palo alto 
if people hadnt been so generous there was no possibility of 
us coming here mrs watling said 
in three other treatments apfelberg sealed some blood vessels to 
halt tumor growth and start the shrinking process as fayes body 
began reabsorbing the cells the operation also caused 90 percent of 
the mark to change from red to a normal skin color 
additional treatment did more of the same and faye was fitted 
with a pressure face mask in england that worn 18 hours a day also 
worked to achieve the same end 
thursdays laser surgery had been set for midjanuary but 
doctors discovered faye was anemic and sent her home to gain 
strength

sen jesse helms accused mexico on thursday of 
a dismal record in helping the united states battle illicit 
drugs launching a bid to deny the country any us economic aid or 
trade benefits 
it appears that mexico is planning to conduct business as 
usual and up to this time mexico has been in the business of 
protecting drug kingpins helms a north carolina republican 
charged 
mexico is this countrys top source for heroin and its no 2 
source of marijuana according to statistics compiled by the 
department of state 
helms comments came as he introduced a measure in the senate to 
remove mexico from a list of nations granted continued us 
financial aid because they have been fully cooperating with the 
us government in its war on drugs 
the measure is cosponsored by sens dennis deconcini dariz 
alfonse damato rny and trent lott rmiss 
under the law president bush is required to formally certify 
that each nation while it may be a major drug producer or transit 
point is cooperating against the war on illicit narcotics 
in a report accompanying the list the state department earlier 
this month praisd mexico for its efforts in the drug war even 
though secretary of sate james a baker iii admitted that the 
international war on illegal drugs was clearly not being won and 
might even be slipping backwards 
the state department cited mexican president carlos salinas 
strong public stance against drugs as well as the efforts of 
his new deputy attorney general but corruption was seen as a 
continuing problem 
last year the senate voted 6327 to punish mexico for its lack 
of cooperation in the battle against drugs but the house killed a 
similar measure 
i am very concerned that the entire certification process has 
become a sham helms said i do not accept the argument that 
decertification of a noncooperating country will hurt us economic 
or diplomatic interests that is pure poppycock 
helms charged that mexico has had a dismal record of 
noncooperation in the drug war in the past year 
he faulted mexico for among other things corruption at the 
highest levels of government for failing to allow overflights and 
hotpursuit actions by us law enforcement aircraft for denying 
access to air surveillance flights for denying access to bank 
records to assist drug investigations and for its failure to 
prosecute the principal suspects in the murder of us drug agent

the jury in oliver norths trial was told 
thursday of a daring plan said to have been approved by 
thenpresident reagan that involved an airdrop of recoilless 
rifles to help the nicaraguan contras sink armscarrying ships 
whether the air drop was ever attempted was not brought out in 
the fifth and last day of questioning norths former white house 
boss robert c mcfarlane after he left the stand the jury was 
dismissed until monday 
mcfarlane said that although he had pleaded guilty to four 
misdemeanor counts of withholding information from congress he felt 
he should not have been charged 
i felt quite passionately about the fact that i had not 
willfully lied to people he said but he added that it was 
quite clear i withheld information and i had to accept the 
consequences of what i had done 
prosecutor john keker referring to papers introduced while 
mfarlane was on the stand said what those documents show is that 
during the period of the boland amendment you and the nsc did a lot 
of things to aid the military activities of the contras 
yes said mcfarlane the boland amendment in force between 
1984 and 1986 prohibited us help to the guerrillas 
the jury learned in the course of mcfarlanes testimony that 
despite boland and with norths encouragement money was solicited 
from other countries tactical advice was offered the contras 
efforts were made to open a new military front in nicaragua plans 
were drawn to shoot down sovietmade helicopters and consideration 
was given to seizing and sinking a ship carrying ammunition to the 
nicaraguan government 
also mcfarlane testified reagan approved 110 million worth of 
inducements to honduras in exchange for giving sanctuary to the 
contras and allowing military aid to pass through 
all this was done because the president said keep the contras 
together body and soul keker asked 
yes said mcfarlane 
he also replied yes when asked if people who were likely to 
be called before congress were kept ignorant of certain information 
so they wouldnt have to lie under oath 
approval by reagan of the airdrop plan was noted by north 
codefendant john m poindexter on a top secret oct 30 1985 
memo drafted by north according to a description offered in court 
by the chief defense lawyer 
as mcfarlane examined the memo on the witness stand attorney 
brendan sullivan said that poindexter had signed the approval line 
and written president approved 
sullivan read portions of the memo and told the jury that under 
the line what to tell the president were these words we 
intend to air drop intelligence along with two recoilless rifles 
which will be used to sink one or both of the arms carriers 
mcfarlane said recoilless rifles are designed to knock out a 
very hard target such as a tank a bunker or a plane on the ground 
or sink a ship as it says here added sullivan 
sullivan asked mcfarlane you understand colonel north had the 
ability to airdrop weapons and intelligence of this sort and this 
was part of his job at the national security council 
yes mcfarlane said 
mcfarlane who was reagans national security adviser at the 
time said the memo did not come to him poindexter was then 
mcfarlanes deputy and later became his successor north a marine 
lieutenant colonel attached to the national security council worked 
for both men 
north is on trial on 12 charges including lying to congress his 
defense has been designed to convey to the jury that he had 
authority for all the actions charged against him as crimes 
meanwhile on thursday poindexter was in another courtroom for 
housekeeping matters in his case he faces trial on charges similar 
to norths and us district judge aubrey robinson said he hoped 
that trial can get under way in summer or early fall after norths 
ends 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh told the judge he does not 
know yet whether the government will follow its action in the north 
case and drop two key charges conspiracy and theft of government 
property that are still lodged against poindexter 
mcfarlane resigned his job as reagans top national security aide 
on dec 4 1985 although he undertook a trip to tehran with north 
the following may to press iran for the release of americans held 
hostage in lebanon the trip was a failure

average incomes dropped again in latin america 
last year by about 1 percent the interamerican development bank 
reported thursday 
the gap in per capita income between latin america and the 
industrialized countries has grown by about onethird in the 
1980s the bank said in its annual report 
some countries did comparatively well chile where the world 
bank put the average income as 1310 in 1987 and ecuador where 
the average had dropped to 1040 both reported growth of 6 percent 
in 1988 that left them still far behind the united states where 
the average citizen earned 18430 in 1987 according to world bank 
figures 
the worst drops more than 3 percent were in guayana 
nicaragua panama peru and trinidad and tobago 
growth was slow in the countries with the biggest economies and 
the biggest debts brazil argentina and mexico in brazil mexico 
and peru where three out of every five latin americans live 
average incomes were down 
the debt overhang continues to sap the economic strength of the 
region undermining its ability to import more and invest more 
the report said 
latin american countries have debts abroad of more than 400 
billion dollars 
lower latin american imports make for less business and fewer 
jobs in the united states and other industrial countries lower 
investment means a lower standard of living for the next generation 
of latin americans 
the report was issued the same day that david mulford assistant 
secretary of the treasury announced the bush administration opposes 
creation of an international debt management authority as proposed 
by congress and latin american leaders 
he also opposed proposals that the fund use its gold or issue 
special drawing rights to help debtor countries or that the 
world bank tap assets that are not now out on loan 
mulford leaves friday to represent the united states in 
amsterdam where the report will be discussed at the annual meeting 
of the 44 governments in the interamerican development bank 
he is expected to announce the end of a threeyear dispute 
between the united states and other donor countries on one side and 
latin american borrowers on the other over power to delay loans by 
the bank 
secretary of state james a baker iii then secretary of the 
treasury asked last year for a change in the banks voting system 
to allow the united states when it could get canadas support to 
delay a loan for as long as two years thus virtually killing it 
long negotiations gave the united states much less a maximum 
delay of 12 months with the need of additional votes beyond its own 
and canadas to get even that according to informed sources who 
declined to be further identified the agreement cleared the way to 
make another 225 billion available to the bank over the next four 
years 
the united states which has 3457 percent of the shares would 
supply 78 billion but only about 350 million would have to be 
paid in 
last year the bank approved 17 billion in new loans to 
modernize industry farms and tourist enterprises improve roads 
increase electric power build health centers clean up water and 
treat sewage 
the report called attention to the growth of new exports from 
latin america soy beans fish fresh fruit 
exports of chilean table grapes alone reached an estimated 500 
million in 1988 said the report prepared well before the 
recent discovery of cyanide in a shipment to the united states

opposition politicians angrily walked out 
of parliament on thursday over a secret report allegedly linking a 
leading government aide to prime minister indira gandhis murder 
all but one of the 93 opposition lawmakers in the 245member 
rajya sabha the upper house of parliament decided to boycott 
proceedings through friday they walked out after chairman shankar 
dayal sharma refused to ask the government to release the report on 
the 1984 slaying 
some of the 63 opposition members who were suspended wednesday 
from the lok sabha or lower house for demanding disclosure of the 
report met with president ramaswamy venkataraman and urged him to 
direct the government to turn over the report to parliament 
the government has said the report will remain classified citing 
national security interests parliament passed a law in july 1986 
five months after the report was completed empowering the 
government to suppress sensitive reports 
government sources said on condition of anonymity that the report 
has been seen only by the slain leaders son and successor rajiv 
gandhi and two senior cabinet ministers who have taken an oath of 
secrecy 
the oppositions demand was first raised tuesday after the indian 
express the countrys largest englishlanguage newspaper published 
excerpts from the report and sought to link a powerful government 
official to mrs gandhis assassination four years ago 
the bombaybased newspaper quoted the inquiry as saying that 
rajendra kumar dhawan mrs gandhis personal secretary for more 
than 20 years had consciously or unconsciously facilitated 
the commission of a crime 
dhawan 52 left the post after the assassination but was brought 
back into the government last month as a key aide to the prime 
minister 
dhawan has refused comment on the allegations but other 
government officials have said he is innocent of any wrongdoing 
but in their memorandum to the president opposition leaders 
argued the report apparently contains findings adverse to mr 
dhawan otherwise the question of his exoneration would not 
have arisen 
the inquiry ordered by the government and conducted by supreme 
court judge mp thakkar ran parallel to police investigations into 
the assassination it was submitted to the government in 1986 
opposition members in the upper house shouted slogans and pounded 
on their desks thursday demanding the government make the report 
public 
when sharma refused to consider the issue opposition legislators 
walked out and said they would not return this week they then 
marched to the presidential palace and delivered copies of tuesdays 
indian express to the president and demanded he order the government 
to release the report 
the indian express which has a nationwide circulation of 11 
million is frequently critical of rajiv gandhi 
mrs gandhi was shot and killed by two sikh bodyguards on oct 
31 1984 as she walked through the garden of her new delhi 
residence to a television interview 
one of the guards was killed in a shootout with other guards the 
other was convicted of murder and hanged jan 5 along with a third 
sikh who was convicted of conspiracy 
in its report the indian express said the government report 
accused dhawan of altering the time of mrs gandhis appointment 
with the television crew and that dhawan who was walking with mrs 
gandhi fell back in the nick of time as they were approaching the 
scene of the assassination 
the government has said mrs gandhi was killed in revenge for an 
army raid she ordered in june 1984 on the golden temple the sikhs 
holiest shrine

thursday in the bayonne city jail in lieu of 50000 bail each 
ortega 28 died saturday at university hospital in newark he 
was brought there two days earlier in a coma and a coroners report 
showed he was beaten about the head arms and body 
county prosecutor paul m depascale has acknowledged that ortega 
did not receive medical treatment for 16 hours after the three 
guards allegedly beat him for about 20 minutes with a blunt object 
depascale said however that the lack of medical treatment did 
not warrant criminal charges and he would not comment on the delay 
in taking ortega to the hospital 
patel said he filed a notice to sue at the county clerks office 
thursday 
state law mandates a sixmonth waiting period between the notice 
to sue and the actual filing patel said he will seek to subpoena 
corrections officers who had any connection with ortega testimony 
could help expose abuses he said 
the death prompted outrage in the community where some have come 
forward with stories of a goon squad that has existed for years 
county executive robert c janiszewski said there is no evidence 
that the group exists but said his office would investigate 
im getting five or 10 calls an hour from people telling me 
they know of the goon squads and that theyve been beaten patel 
said maybe this suit can help do something about it 
omar aziz a moslem chaplain at the jail for eight years told 
the jersey journal that inmates have repeatedly complained to him 
about abuse by corrections officers particularly during the 
midnight to 8 am shift 
the targets of the beatings are usually hispanics and blacks 
aziz said 
the three officers charged worked the midnight shift depascale 
said 
corrections officers thomas murphy 39 and david michael dumers 
35 and deputy warden raymond murray 52 all of jersey city were 
arrested after surrendering to depascale murray was in charge of 
the shift at the time

the soviet union said thursday it has 
resumed flying arms to afghanistan because of a guerrilla offensive 
around jalalabad the first major battle since the red army 
completed its withdrawal feb 15 
moslem guerrillas claimed thursday they had shot down two more 
aircraft in heavy fighting for jalalabad a strategic eastern city 
that is the nations thirdlargest the communist government claimed 
470 insurgents killed in the previous 24 hours 
soviet ambassador yuri vorontsov said the airlift resumed 
wednesday a month after the red army left the kabul government to 
fight the insurgents on its own 
he said the weapons included mediumrange scud b missiles which 
are said to have been fired from kabul at guerrilla positions around 
jalababad 75 miles to the east and 40 miles from the pakistan 
border 
sources said at least 40 ilyushin76 transport planes had landed 
at thge kabul airport since wednesday with military supplies and 
food 
vorontsov accused pakistan of sending hundreds of its own 
soldiers with the guerrillas in the intense 10day battle for 
jalalabad 
we have discussed the situation with the pakistanis and they 
know what our reaction will be if their involvement continues he 
said we are not threatening the pakistanis but they must stop 
pakistan supports the guerrillas along with the united states 
but denies any of its soldiers are fighting in afghanistan the 
foreign ministry called vorontsovs allegation fictitious 
in moscow the official news agency tass said pakistani forces 
were coordinating the attack on jalalabad and forcing teenage 
refugees to take up arms 
units of pakistani mercenaries were ordered to carry out forced 
mobilization starting from age 14 in the afghan refugee camps near 
peshawar tass in a dispatch from kabul 
eyewitness accounts indicate that hundreds of refugee families 
have decided to return to afghanistan on learning about the order 
it said protests against the arbitrary actions of the pakistani 
military flared up in several camps 
tass said afghan insurgents and pakistani soldiers fired on 
protesters killing seven people and wounding 12 others 
a separate tass dispatch from kabul accused pakistani 
intelligence officers of coordinating the guerrilla attack 
moslem guerrillas began fighting in afghanistan after a communist 
coup in april 1978 soviet military forces arrived in december 1979 
and an estimated 115000 were in the country when the unmediated 
withdrawal began may 15 1988 
observers believe a guerrilla victory at jalalabad along the 
main highway from pakistan to kabul could lead to the fall of the 
capital 
the guerrillarun afghan news agency said insurgents downed a 
helicopter gunship near jalalabads television station and an 
airplane outside the city on wednesday 
the latest guerrilla claim brought to seven the number of 
government aircraft reported destroyed this week in the fight for 
jalalabad 
there was no immediate comment from the afghan government and it 
was not possible to confirm the claims 
kabul radio claimed thursday that 470 insurgents were killed in 
the last 24 hours around jalalabad bringing the total for two days 
to 1030 guerrillas call the kabul claims widely exaggerated 
it said only six of its troops were killed in the jalalabad 
fighting in the last 24 hours it also said the guerrillas fired 
thousands of rockets and artillery shells into jalalabad during 
this period killing four civilians and injuring 18 
the guerrillarun afghan news agency said 25 afghan troops were 
killed and 32 captured in jalalabad on thursday 
guerrillas have overrun the citys most important garrison 
samarkhel to the east and were closing in on the airport 
but afghan soldiers retaliated with unexpectedly aggressive 
aerial and artillery bombardments that reportedly have stalled the 
guerrillas progress 
fighting centers north west and south of the city according to 
reports reaching pakistan 
leaders of the ussupported guerrillas have predicted an early 
collapse of the kabul government in the absence of its soviet 
backers but president najib has insisted his forces are strong 
enough to survive

interior secretary manuel lujans suggestion 
that economic impact be considered when officials decide whether to 
grant endangered species status was sharply criticized thursday by 
environmental groups 
his comments are embarassing and naive said jay hair 
president of the national wildlife federation he sounds like a 
kinder and gentler james watt 
brock evans a vice president of the national audubon society 
said lujan should review or reconsider his remarks im 
disappointed and it doesnt send very good signals about president 
bush being an environmental president 
lujan in an interview with the seattle postintelligencer said 
the spotted owl dispute unfolding in the pacific northwest was a 
prime example of the difficulty in balancing environmental 
concerns with economic impacts 
im told on the one hand that i want to protect an endangered 
species lujan said on the other hand i hear thats going to 
devastate the entire northwest lumber industry 
how do we solve that problem i believe we should be able to 
take economic considerations into account 
he suggested that the endangered species act be amended to make 
economic impact part of the determination process 
under existing law the fish and wildlife service may consider 
only biological factors when deciding whether to protect a 
species the fish and wildlife service is part of the interior 
department 
maybe we should change the law to consider economic factors 
lujan said 
steven goldstein an interior department spokesman said thursday 
that lujan believes that while economic impact was not a reason to 
exclude a species from protection it is something we should 
take into account when we are making that decision 
we need to factor that into the equation said goldstein 
we cant operate in a vacuum 
the spotted owl which nests only in the ancient forests of the 
northwest has become the focal point of an increasingly heated 
battle over protecting old growth timber 
environmentalists have sought to have the owl protected as an 
endangered species but the timber industry has insisted that such a 
designation could halt logging in vast areas of the northwest and 
result in the loss of thousands of jobs 
the fish and wildlife service had previously denied a request 
from environmentalists that the owl be listed as endangered but a 
federal court in seattle ordered the agency to review its decision

older workers have been coerced into signing 
away their rights as corporations try to get rid of betterpaid 
employees in favor of younger lowerpaid newcomers three early 
retirees told a senate hearing thursday 
it is difficult for me to believe that an employee who works in 
america today who has been a loyal and successful worker for one 
employer for a long time can be fired from his or her job and 
forced to sign away their rights under the law said kenneth 
lancaster of st paul minn 
if i had known more about the equal rights laws and had known 
on dec 31 1983 that my replacement was 28 years old i would not 
have signed anything he told the senate subcommittee on labor 
the subcommittee headed by sen howard metzenbaum dohio is 
considering metzenbaumsponsored legislation to forbid employers 
from asking older workers to waive their rights under the law as a 
condition of taking advantage of early retirement incentives 
threefourths of employers dont use waivers why do the other 
25 percent have to metzenbaum said 
a general accounting office survey of 60 fortune 100 
companies showed 24 percent of the companies that had early 
retirement incentives required workers to sign waivers in order to 
get beefedup benefits the use of waivers has tripled over the past 
10 years the gaos joseph delfico told the committee 
the chairman of the equal employment opportunity commission told 
the panel no new law is needed because of regulatory action taken in 
1987 aimed at accomplishing the same goal 
but the gao survey showed 198788 was a peak period for the use 
of waivers 
the companies surveyed by gao the investigative arm of congress 
reported they used the waivers to avoid having terminated 
employees file claims and lawsuits after receiving enhanced benefits 
from exit incentive programs delfico testified 
lancaster said he was one year from being vested in his pension 
plan when the car dealership for which he was service manager fired 
him after 12 years on the job in a new years eve meeting the 
dealership offered six months severance pay in exchange for a 
signature on a release of all claims lancaster said 
i was given no reason for my termination they had already 
hired someon in my place lancaster told the panel i was told i 
had to sign the release letter immediately in order to get the 
severance pay 
i asked to take the documents home to review them but they 
said no i asked for time to talk to an attorney but they said i 
didnt need to because the dealerships lawyers had already gone 
over everything he said 
robert patterson a draftsman said he was told by his manager at 
xerox corp there was a 99 percent sure chance you will be laid 
off if an early retirement offer was refused 
i had only seven working days to make a decision patterson 
said 
gerald clay of peoria ill said he was offered a years salary 
if he signed documents waiving his rights under the age 
discrimination employment act 
what happened to me shouldnt happen to anybody he said 
a law partner in a national firm testified that metzenbaums 
proposal could hurt companies that havent discriminated 
the real effect of the bill in individual cases would be to 
create a system whereby disputes could not be settled without the 
intervention of eeoc or a court and would put an end to many 
internal company grievance programs that have been developed over 
the years to deal with employee complaints said attorney cathie 
a shattuck whos represented both employers and disgruntled 
employees

a woman who founded a national group that 
grants wishes of dying children has closed an office and dropped 
from sight raising questions about the status of the charity and 
the way she handled donations 
better business bureau officials say they havent spoken with 
mary girardin since december shortly before she closed the tworoom 
offices of a childs wish come true inc 
i dont know where she is said barbara sinnott president of 
the better business bureau of central new england 
in 1985 the last year the charity filed financial statements 
with the state the group reported it took in 400000 but gave only 
onethird of the money to terminally ill children sinnott said the 
bbb recommends that 60 percent of revenues should go to the stated 
purpose of the charity 
we have just consistently reported that it has not measured up 
to the recommended amount of giving she said 
girardin apparently has disconnected her telephone in worcester 
and could not be reached for comment by the associated press on 
thursday 
sinnott said she sent three letters to girardin asking for 
updated information on the organization but never received the 
information 
the group has in the past sponsored trips for ill children to 
disneyworld 
several groups such as a childs wish come true have sprung up in 
the past decade while most of the groups are legitimate the 
powerful fundraising appeal of brightening a dying childs last 
days has posed some problems charity officials said 
unfortunately people have very open hearts and when you have a 
cause that sounds good and they get any kind of good publicity and 
people dont check then they tend to open their wallets sinnott 
said 
in pennsylvania a group called the sunshine foundation was 
investigated by the state attorney generals office which 
criticized the foundations handling of 34000 in fund money 
no charges were filed but a new executive director was selected 
for the charity after a meeting between the foundations board of 
directors and state officials 
theyre making progress towards bringing their accounting 
procedures in line with those of a responsible notforprofit 
corporation deputy attorney general mollie mccurdy said 
in texas the attorney generals office filed a civil suit in 
1986 against a group called rainbow foundation after an 
investigation showed little of the money raised went to children 
said rose ann reeser deputy attorney general in charge of the 
charitable organizations division 
the problem that we have with those organizations as with a 
lot of organizations like this is you cant track down your 
money reeser said anytime you deal with a dying child its a 
very compelling thing 
the suit against rainbow foundation was dismissed after its 
founder died reeser said

if european countries dont end a ban on 
americas hormonetreated beef us military commissaries there 
could stop buying europes meat two house committee chairmen said 
thursday 
reps kika de la garza dtexas chairman of the agriculture 
committee and les aspin dwis chairman of the armed services 
committee said they are looking into the idea of shipping us beef 
and dairy products to the 131 us commissaries on military bases in 
europe instead of letting them buy european products 
the united states shouldnt be buying from european sources 
while the europeans are closing their markets to our products 
said de la garza the armed services and agriculture committees 
will take up this matter at a hearing this spring he added 
aspin said it may be more practical now than in the past to ship 
us beef and other products to europe in light of a decline in the 
value of the dollar 
the committees will be examining the transportation system 
pricing and funding for shipment of these products said de la 
garza 
the european community has been refusing to accept meat from 
livestock treated with growth hormones while us officials say the 
meat is not dangerous to humans 
last year military commissaries sold 46 million pounds of 
european beef for 55 million said aspin and de la garza before 
the european ban on hormonetreated beef the united states was 
selling about 100 million worth of beef in europe

the senate refused thursday to dismiss 
impeachment charges that federal district judge alcee l hastings of 
miami conspired to get a 150000 bribe and later lied about it at 
his trial 
the senate voted 921 against dismissal of 15 of the 17 articles 
of impeachment against the 52yearold miami judge the lawmakers 
then voted 930 against dismissal of another article 
hastings had not sought dismissal of still another charge that 
he disclosed information obtained from a federal wiretap and thus 
torpedoed a federal investigation of miamiarea corruption 
the senate acted after 2 hours of deliberation on the 
52yearold judges move for dismissal of the charges on grounds 
that he had been acquitted in a 1983 trial and could not get a fair 
hearing in the senate now in any case because too much time has 
passed 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio voted in favor of dismissal on 
the first of hastings two motions which would have dropped the 
first 15 of the articles of impeachment 
metzenbaum was not reached immediately for comment but press 
secretary nancy coffey said the senator had constitutional qualms 
about an impeachment trial on charges of which hastings already had 
been acquitted 
those were the counts on which he was acquitted and the senator 
had constitutional concerns about double jeopardy coffey said 
the senates decision sets the stage for an impeachment trial 
expected to take as much as six weeks before a special senate 
committee 
the panels proceedings are to be videotaped for viewing by 
senators who lack time to sit through the lengthy presentation of 
evidence the case then will come back to the senate floor for a 
vote on whether to remove hastings from the bench and take away his 
89500 annual salary 
hastings himself on wednesday took the senate floor to make a 
personal appeal to the lawmakers to drop charges that he plotted to 
obtain the payoff and then committed perjury to win his 1983 
acquittal 
i proclaimed my innocence then as i have from the outset and as 
i do now hastings told the lawmakers 
rep john bryant dtexas one of a panel of house prosecutors 
told the senate however that the judges doublejeopardy defense did 
not apply to impeachment trials and that hastings should forfeit his 
job because of his inexcusable breaches of the public trust 
in contrast the senators deliberated behind closed doors on 
thursday and voted on hastings dismissal motion without any public 
debate 
hastings stands accused of conspiring with washington attorney 
william borders in 1981 to reduce from threeyear prison sentences 
to probation the punishment of two brothers frank and tom romano of 
miami they were convicted in hastings court of skimming from a 
teamsters union pension fund loan 
in return hastings and borders were to receive 150000 
the romano brothers both of whom have since died refused to pay 
any bribe but the fbi mounted a stingtype operation and arrested 
borders pulling out of a suburban virginia motel with a garment bag 
containing 125000 handed to him by an undercover agent 
masquerading as frank romano 
borders was convicted of conspiracy and went to prison 
the house voted the articles of impeachment 4133 on aug 3

the traditional palm sunday procession in 
jerusalem was canceled on thursday because of the palestinian 
uprising in the israelioccupied lands 
on the political front prime minister yitzhak shamirs spokesman 
said thursday that shamir has been holding secret meetings with 
palestinian leaders who do not belong to the plo spokesman avi 
pazner confirmed a report on israel tv that such meetings were under 
way 
israeli arab leaders meanwhile called for a general strike by 
israels 810000 arab residents on march 30 to support the 
rebellion which has killed at least 396 palestinians and 17 
israelis since it began on dec 8 1987 
violence continued thursday with 40 palestinians reported 
injured in the occupied west bank and gaza strip most of them 
beaten by israeli soldiers the territories have been under israeli 
control since the 1967 middle east war 
a spokesman for father michel sabbah the first arab catholic 
patriarch of jerusalem said the palm sunday parade was called off 
this year as it was last year because it is not possible to have 
it with all the schools closed 
schools in the west bank and gaza strip have been closed since 
last year by israel which considers them flashpoints for the 
uprising 
schoolchildren traditionally march in the parade which 
commemorates jesus triumphal entrance into jerusalem amid waving 
palm fronds borne by his disciples 
in the churches everything will be held as usual said the 
spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
in the gaza strip soldiers destroyed three palestinian homes and 
sealed two others to punish antiisraeli activists 
that touched off demonstrations in which palestinian youths 
burned tires raised outlawed palestinian flags and hurled rocks at 
troops arab reports said 
soldiers opened fire at several protests and one 16yearold 
palestinian was reported wounded ahli arab and shifa hospitals in 
gaza city reported treating 35 palestinians for beating injuries 
the dynamited homes belonged to palestinians arrested this month 
for allegedly belonging to an assassination team linked to palestine 
liberation organization chief yasser arafat the army said 
three west bank palestinians were shot and wounded in 
stonethrowing clashes with soldiers including two teenagers shot 
in the legs in kabatiya arab reports said 
a palestinian shop in nablus and one in ramallah were set ablaze 
by fellow palestinians for selling israelimade goods police said 
no injuries were reported 
leaders of the uprising have repeatedly called on store owners to 
boycott israeli goods 
in gaza strips jabaliya refugee camp troops late wednesday 
night bulldozed the home of ibrahim abu mor a palestinian lawyer 
wanted by israeli authorities for allegedly heading islamic jihad a 
fundamentalist moslem group the army said 
the united states objects to the destruction of homes as undue 
punishment especially when the activists have not been tried in 
court 
the strike call to israeli arabs was issued at a meeting in 
shaferam arab israeli leaders said businesses will be closed and 
rallies will be held on march 30 to protest against israeli 
government discrimination against arab citizens and to show 
solidarity with the people in the occupied territories 
the march 30 date commemorates a 1976 incident in which six arabs 
were killed in the galilee in clashes over land expropriations by 
israel 
pazner meanwhile told the associated press thursday that shamirs 
meetings with palestinians started last december 
its purpose is to have a dialogue with nonplo palestinians he 
has been meeting with nonplo palestinians and he will continue to 
do so pazner said 
he declined to identify the palestinians saying it could 
endanger their lives 
his disclosure came a day after shamirs foreign minister moshe 
arens reacted strongly and negatively to suggestions by us 
secretary of state james a baker iii that israel consider talks 
directly with the plo if other peace avenues fail 
arens is in the united states in advance of an expected april 
trip by shamir

the communist party approved sweeping agricultural 
reforms thursday giving farmers long leases on state land to 
produce more of the meat fruit and fresh vegetables for which 
housewives now wait in line for hours 
an average soviet citizen now consumes about half as much meat 
and fruit as an american but up to double the sugar and potatoes 
yegor k ligachev the ruling politburos man in charge of farm 
policy promised the people diets up to generally recognized 
standards of nutrition by 1996 
we are not promising something that we cannot achieve he 
told his first news conference with foreign reporters we will be 
able to change the food situation for the better 
the meeting of the 300member central committee also elected the 
partys 100 members to the congress of peoples deputies a new 
2550seat legislative body that will meet for the first time in the 
spring president mikhail s gorbachev was among them 
gorbachev had proposed that farmers be given longterm leases on 
land so they would become more efficient he also urged that they be 
allowed to decide what to plant on the land rather than having the 
bureaucracy decide 
western analysts have said the new system will do little good 
unless leaseholders are allowed to choose which crops to plant set 
their own prices and make other decisions 
ligachev said leases could be signed for any period of more than 
five years and be passed on succeeding generations of a family he 
said no one would be forced to lease land and that the giant state 
and collective farms would remain the backbone of the soviet 
agricultural system 
radical changes in rural life and production relations should 
be carried out on a purely voluntary basis without any kind of 
force or repressive methods said ligachev 68 who is widely 
regarded as a conservative force in the politburo 
setting targets for leasing would only encourage strongarm 
tactics to fulfill the plans he said 
in statements at the meeting leasing was only one of many 
methods for improving production he said the new approach to 
agriculture also would include selffinancing and greater democracy 
in rural life 
state and collective farms still will dominate agriculture he 
said some soviet press reports have come close to advocating they 
be scrapped but ligachev said none of the 12 politburo members 
favor it 
any proposal that leads to abolishing state and collective 
farms has no foundation whatsoever he declared 
even when land is leased to individuals and groups he said 
state and collective farms will oversee production proceeding 
from the needs and possibilities of society 
soviet television showed an hourlong report on the meeting 
including speeches by local and moscowbased officials echoing 
gorbachevs calls for agriculture 
the meeting abolished the giant superministry in charge of 
agricultural policy and gorbachev interrupted its chief vsevolod 
murakovsky who favored the traditional system in which all local 
regions are required to send a percentage of their harvest to 
central authorities 
the television breaking with its ususal practice cut off its 
report before gorbachev gave his final statement to the plenum 
ususally gorbachevs statements in televised forums constitute the 
main part of the tv report 
in a nearly twohour speech wednesday gorbachev painted a 
devastating picture of soviet agriculture with chemically spoiled 
land investments gone sour and destruction of systems prevalent in 
the 1920s 
he said food shortages were inadmissible the shortage of food 
creates social tension and generates not merely criticism but actual 
discontent 
he said conditions in villages in some regions were so bad that 
emigration to the cities had reached a critical level 
when josef stalin forced agricultural collectivization in the 
1930s on a populace that was 80 percent agrarian millions of 
peasants were deported to siberia and other remote regions or fled 
to cities catastrophic famine ensued 
ever since farmers working for stateowned farms have generally 
delivered their yields to market at fixed prices to meet quotas set 
by the state bureaucracy

vice president dan quayle said thursday that 
despite his sometimes harsh rhetoric which has contrasted with 
president bushs he is not a lightning rod for bush as spiro agnew 
was for president nixon 
playing on a memorable campaign exchange between himself and 
democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen quayle said he 
had asked bush about the agnew comparison made by more than one 
quayle watcher 
bush paraphrased bentsens line during last falls vice 
presidential debate attacking quayle for comparing himself to john 
f kennedy quayle said in a quip that drew appreciative laughter 
from his audience at the national press club 
he put his hand on my shoulder he said dan i knew spiro 
agnew spiro agnew was a friend of mine and youre no spiro 
agnew quayle said 
but quayle reiterated his attack on the senate for its rejection 
of bushs defense secretary nominee john tower saying that smear 
information was used 
last week quayle went further saying in an indianapolis speech 
that the senates rejection of tower signaled a legislative attack 
on the power of the presidency and a return to the tactics of the 
mccarthy era 
bushs own rhetoric about his first major defeat in congress 
since becoming president was decidedly milder bush said the episode 
was history and he wanted to move forward with good relations 
quayle said that when he made the accusation in indianapolis he 
was not performing the agnew toughguy role to bushs nice guy 
agnew drew fire with his pungent speeches that often criticizing the 
media and liberals in general 
but quayle said senators who knew tower and had served with him 
relied on other witnesses and unsubstantiated rumors instead of 
their own knowledge of the man and he offered another theory about 
towers defeat 
i do believe were starting to set a new standard what brought 
down john tower was probably more on the likeability issue that he 
simply was not wellliked i dont believe that is a criteria to be 
used for whether the president ought to have the right to have his 
person as secretary of defense 
quayle also defended the new administrations pace which has 
been criticized as too slow 
were succeeding an administration of our own party at a time 
when the country is in good shape so were certainly not going 
to be stampeded into doing things for the sake of doing them soon 
or quickly or to show momentum or some such thing 
quick fixes are often bad fixes quayle added 
quayle also criticized politicians frantic efforts to gain 
press attention but said he was not referring to the mediawise 
campaign that elected him and bush last fall 
he said the political process is distorted when the need to 
make the 7 oclock news can lead politicians to announce initiatives 
that really arent well thought out initiatives that might well 
make the headlines but might not be very good for the health of the 
country 
asked about the bushquayle campaigns acknowledged management of 
the daily news packaging events and keeping the candidates away 
from reporters to keep from cluttering the canned message quayle 
said he was not talking about campaigns but added youve got a 
certain message you want to get across 
in his speech quayle said he was criticizing the way frantic 
efforts to gain press attention and produce sound bites can distort 
our political process by elevating form over substance and image 
over reality 
as to the blistering press reports about his own background that 
percolated throughout the campaign the vice president said he 
probably benefited from it in the long run he said the intense 
scrutiny was to be expected because he had been a littleknown 
senator outside his home state of indiana when bush picked him for a 
running mate 
youre an open target to criticism by your opposition that is 
the way we conduct our campaigns he said its healthy to see 
how one musters the scrutiny i believe i have emerged a stronger 
and better person because of it its an experience that had a 
meaningful purpose for me as being the vice president of the united 
states

moslem gunners blasted beiruts port 
thursday setting a cargo ship and a warehouse afire in fierce 
battles with christian forces around the capital no casualties were 
reported 
artillery duels in beirut and in the mountains above the capital 
coincided with a nationwide strike staged by moslems to mourn 
victims of the previous week of fighting which police said left 49 
people killed and 161 wounded 
a syrian official was quoted as saying an arab league committee 
has canceled a third meeting between rival moslem and christian 
cabinets to end the violence 
a police spokesman said moslem gunners blasted the beirut port 
with 25 rockets setting fire to a cargo ship that tried to return 
from open waters during a lull in the fighting 
the spokesman identified the stricken vessel as the angie 
wipp and said he could not give any details about its flag owners 
or what kind of cargo it carried 
one of the ports warehouses also took a direct rocket hit during 
the attacks said the spokesman who cannot be further identified 
under standing regulations 
christian gunners fired a barrage of 155mm howitzer fire at the 
moslem residential districts of sabra and kasskass abutting beiruts 
dividing green line said a police spokesman 
sniper fire and occasional grenade blasts crackled across the 
ruins of the old commercial district 
the police spokesman said the new hostilities in souk elgharb 
15 miles southeast of beirut erupted shortly before sundown between 
christian army commander gen michel aouns forces which hold the 
town and druse fighters on nearby hills 
the town commands a network of mountain roads leading from druse 
territory to the christian heartland north and northeast of the 
capital 
aouns forces appeared to be following through with his stated 
intention to drive syrias 40000 troops out of lebanon militiamen 
of druse warlord walid jumblatts progressive socialist party are 
backed by syria 
the christianrun addiyar newspaper on thursday quoted an 
unidentifed syrian official as saying that damascus has not yet 
taken a decision to retaliate against gen aoun but if aoun 
should continue his provocations retaliation will be decisive 
the official was quoted as saying arab league peace talks will 
not be held the fighting was sparked by a march 6 airandsea 
blockade aoun clamped on illegal harbors run by moslem militias 
south of beirut 
the blockade angered jumblatt whose party runs two illegal port 
facilities jumblatt vowed to bombard the christianrun beirut port 
as long as the blockade of druse harbors was maintained 
lebanons commerical sea traffic was virtually halted and beirut 
international airport the nations only air gateway has been shut 
since saturday 
aoun 53 heads the christian cabinet that has been vying for 
legitimacy with acting prime minister salim hoss moslem cabinet 
the rival governments have been in place since parliament failed 
to elect a successor to president amin gemayel when his term ended 
in september

a twoyear legal battle over the states 
refusal to allow ceremonial sweat lodges for indian inmates at utah 
state prison ended thursday when a federal judge ruled the ban is 
unconstitutional 
applause broke out in the packed courtroom and american indians 
from several different tribes chanted and pounded drums outside 
after us district judge j thomas greene struck down the ban in a 
bench ruling on motions for summary judgment 
im grateful the words are kind of hard to come by at this 
time because the feeling is so good said george a roybal an 
assiniboine sioux who as a utah prison inmate in march 1987 
initiated the lawsuit with five other inmates 
what this thing is all about is us trying to help our people to 
help themselves he said 
the utah department of corrections had contended the sweat lodge 
which tribal officials contend is central to purification and 
ceremonial rites dating back 40000 years threatened security 
because the lodge must be dark and enclosed 
but greene cited two us supreme court rulings and the success 
of sweat lodges in 19 other state prison systems and two federal 
penitentiaries in rejecting arguments that the small willow and 
canvas structures posed a security risk 
the judge said the prohibition was unreasonable and resulted in 
the native american religion not being accommodated to the extent 
other religions are 
the sweat lodge will simply be another chapel located within 
the prison greene said 
michael obrien an attorney representing the american civil 
liberties union said guards could monitor ceremonies and prison 
officials could impose limitations such as searches and requirements 
that the lodge be dismantled after each service 
the record is clear that 19 other states and the federal prison 
system accommodate these sweat lodges without risk to security 
obrien said 
telephone messages left at the office of joseph tesch the 
associate utah attorney general who defended the case for the state 
were not immediately returned 
the aclu was one of several groups that provided legal or moral 
support to the inmates cause the native american rights fund and 
the giant navajo nation also joined the plaintiffs in the lawsuit 
while the central salt lake city council of churches representing 
pastors from six denominations urged gov norm bangerter to 
intervene on the inmates behalf 
prison officials had earlier offered to allow a modified sweat 
lodge equipped with a window and mechanical heating instead of the 
required heated rocks but plaintiffs attorney danny quintana 
called the suggestion blasphemous 
greene concurred telling associate utah attorney general joseph 
tesch at one point its like saying to a christian you can have 
a ceremony but dont mention christ 
attorneys for the navajo nation which manages sweat lodge 
programs for 500 inmates in federal and state systems argued that 
the ceremonies are vital to rehabilitation 
the sweat lodge provides a link between the incarcerated indian 
inmate and his tribe and the program administered by the navajos 
offers drug and alcohol counseling in addition to spiritual 
guidance said navajo lawyer lee bergen

the scare over tampering of fresh fruit from chile has reduced 
sales of all fruit at some markets but others reported thursday 
that consumers are asking more questions but not cutting back much 
on their shopping lists 
consumers definitely dont want any fruit from chile and we 
dont offer any fruit from chile they pick up apples from 
washington and ask if theyre from chile said david sneddon 
coowner of fairway a large new york city fruit market 
on monday the united states urged consumers not to eat chilean 
fruit after two grapes imported from chile were found to be tainted 
with a small amount of cyanide most chilean fruit was pulled from 
us market shelves 
the finding of the tainted fruit followed anonymous calls to the 
us embassy in santiago earlier this month from a man who 
threatened to inject cyanide into chiles export fruit 
officials had concluded the first call was apparently a hoax 
after precautionary inspections revealed no sign of tampering but 
when a second call was received march 8 saying the threat was not a 
hoax further inspections turned up two tainted seedless red grapes 
in philadelphia on sunday 
unlike some other grocers brian johnson produce manager at the 
byerlys grocery store in edina minn said he had seen a drop in 
fruit sales even types that are not grown in chile 
ive noticed some melon sales slowing down even though they 
arent even from chile and even with bananas which was a real 
shocker since they are grown nowhere near chile he said this 
has created a certain air of uncertainty about buying fruit 
sales have slowed down quite a bit johnson said adding that 
a drop in fruit sales was particularly important to grocers because 
of the jump of interest in fresh fruit recent years as consumers 
have become more healthconscious 
in new york sneddon said consumers were still buying fruit as 
long as we confirm for them its not from chile he estimated that 
overall his business is down only about five thousand bucks or 
something like that 
at balduccis an upscale specialty market in new yorks 
greenwich village produce department manager gino roselli said his 
business was off about 10 percent but he said that was due mainly 
to higher prices for fruit from sources other than chile not to a 
general fear of tampering 
mary ellen gowin vice president for consumer and public affairs 
at shop rite a national chain based in new jersey said chilean 
fruit accounts for about 15 percent of the chains fruit sales at 
this time of year so we still have 85 percent to work with 
people are very cautious and concerned she said we 
recognize that the company has posted signs in produce 
departments and is displaying shipping containers showing the 
fruits country of origin she said and sales of nonchilean 
products are holding up well 
consumers like fruit and will substitute they are very 
understanding she said 
mike demay coowner of taits super valu in des moines said the 
reaction to the chilean threat could invite more of the same 
the next guy will do it to bananas or lettuce he said but 
the biggest part of the problem is that the customers confidence is 
going to be further eroded in their belief in our food safety 
system 
mike loffredo vice president of loffredo fresh produce inc a 
des moines food wholesaler questioned whether officials overreacted 
its just been blown out of proportion loffredo said 
fruits imported from chile include grapes nectarines peaches 
plums apricots pears granny smith apples cherries raspberries 
blueberries cantaloupe and honeydew melons substitute sources are 
available for most types of fruit except for grapes virtually all 
of which come from chile at this time of year

in a second blow to maverick boris n yeltsin in 
the waning days of his parliamentary election campaign the 
communist party began an investigation thursday of allegations that 
he opposes some party positions

two days after publication in a central committee journal of the 
november 1987 speech that got him fired as moscow party chief

of peoples deputies and has said the campaign marks his political 
rehabilitation

stood at variance with the party line and those messages received by 
the plenary meeting suggested the issue be formally discussed

multiparty system the ideologist said but also told the central 
committee he wants the issue discussed in the official press

president bush on thursday moved to deflect 
criticism that his administration is off to a slow start declaring 
more is going on than meets the eye 
in his first trip back to his adopted home state since the 
inauguration bush said he was grappling with ticking time bombs 
that we need to defuse without delay and were doing just that 
he mentioned the savings and loan industry burgeoning debt in 
the third world and drug abuse in the united states 
bush said in a luncheon speech that his administration was 
working on an american agenda for the long term 
in the speech and a questionandanswer session that followed 
bush also 
called on congress to move more quickly on his plan to shore up 
troubled savings and loans saying theres no excuse for delay 
declared himself very pleased that the senate armed services 
committee had voted approval of his new defense secretary nominee 
rep dick cheney but also complained anew that his rejected first 
choice former texas sen john tower was tried by perception and 
rumor that is not the american way 
but in washington sen ernest hollings dsc released an 
unclassified fbi report which said a background investigation of 
tower had turned up a prior pattern of alcohol abuse it was 
reports about towers drinking and relations with women along with 
his acceptance of consulting fees from defense contractors that led 
to his defeat 
firmly restated his opposition to democraticbacked efforts to 
raise the minimum wage to 465 an hour saying his own plan for a 
maximum 425 wage with a lower training wage was my first and 
last offer 
said in regard to the emotional issue of restrictions on 
semiautomatic weapons i do want to find a solution to the 
socalled ak47 assault weapon problem one that protects the 
rights of the legitimate sportsman but also protects the lives of 
our police officers who are laying their lives on the line 
bush spokesman marlin fitzwater said the president supports the 
action wednesday of colt industries to suspend sales to the public 
of its ar47 semiautomatic rifle the civilian version of the 
military m16 
he thinks its a reasonable move on their part fitzwater 
said 
on tuesday the administration announced it would suspend the 
import of most foreignmade semiautomatic rifles 
in addition to saying he was pursuing his agenda at his own 
speed bush said thursday he was not going to be forced into moving 
more quickly in dealings with the soviet union 
he said recent changes in the soviet union are profound 
but were facing a challenge weve got to figure it out weve 
got to measure soviet intentions and then move he said 
on another foreign policy issue fitzwater said bush had decided 
in principal to go ahead with a proposed joint venture with the 
japanese for the production in japan of a new version of the f16 
fighter 
however the spokesman said that bush must still decide on 
safeguards to prevent the loss of sensitive technology and that a 
final decision may not come until next week 
bush told his audience at the forum club in houston ive come 
home to texas to tell you were hard at work in washington and 
were making progress 
later he was traveling to colorado springs colo to address 
the junior achievement national business leadership conference 
when he arrived at 6800foot high colorado springs bush 
immediately went to a local high school and did seven laps walking 
and jogging around a quartermile track 
as he passed a group of reporters the president threw up his 
arms and said no air 
 
embargoed for 1035 pm est

later bush focused on educational issues in a speech to the 
junior achievement national business hall of fame dinner in 
colordado springs colo 
i cant think of any issue that is larger or more farranging 
in its impact than the education of our youth bush said in 
prepared remarks 
when it comes to our nations future education is the key 
its the best investment we can make he said 
 
end embargoed material 
 
before leaving on his twoday western trip bush talked to the 
discovery shuttle astronauts todays pioneers from the oval 
office inviting them to the white house upon their return and 
promising a strong active space program despite budget 
constraints 
eight weeks into his administration bush has been the target of 
criticism in the democraticled congress that he has failed to move 
quickly enough on an agenda 
bush said thursday in this kind of work more is going on than 
meets the eye or makes the headlines 
the proof will come when we look back from the year 2000 and 
im confident that we will be able to look back with pride on work 
we did to get ready for a new century provided we look forward 
today 
in washington vice president dan quayle also defended the new 
administrations pace saying were succeeding an administration 
of our own party at a time when the country is in good shape so 
were certainly not going to be stampeded into doing things for the 
sake of doing them soon or quickly or to show momentum or some 
such thing 
quick fixes are often bad fixes quayle added in a speech to 
the national press club 
bush rattled off a variety of positions his administration has

republican lawmakers blocked democratic efforts 
thursday night to have the senate consider legislation that would 
require president bush to intervene in the eastern airlines strike 
the procedural standoff made it likely that the measure passed 
wednesday by the house could not come to a vote until after the 
senates twoweek easter recess which begins saturday 
the bill would force bush to name an emergency board to recommend 
a solution to the strike and would impose a coolingoff period of 
up to 26 days during which the airlines employees would receive 
prestrike wages bush opposes the bill arguing the dispute between 
eastern and its unions should be settled directly between the two 
sides and administration officials have said the measure would be 
vetoed 
after hours of closeddoor talks between legislators from the two 
parties senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine tried to 
commence debate on the measure arguing that steps should be taken 
to end the twoweek old walkout 
the federal government should not simply sit by waiting for 
something to happen mitchell said 
republicans blocked that effort using procedures under which an 
individual lawmaker can prevent the consideration of a bill they 
argued the measure should be studied for at least a week by the 
senate labor committee saying the situation was complicated by 
potential efforts to buy the airline and by easterns filing for 
protection from creditors under the bankruptcy code 
there is a desire for us not to bottle this thing up forever 
said sen john danforth rmo 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan would not say that 
republicans would filibuster the measure under which lengthy debate 
is used in an effort to kill a bill but he said debate would be 
intense 
mitchell said he would seek a vote after the easter recess that 
would prevent a filibuster such a vote would require 60 votes from 
the 100member senate in which democrats have 55 members 
the house passed the unionsupported bill by a 252167 vote with 
all but 20 votes coming from its majority democrats

the defense minister and 
presidential candidates on thursday condemned a paralyzing transport 
ban declared by leftist rebels and urged voters to reject guerrilla 
violence by going to the polls sunday 
we have enough evidence of the salvadoran peoples courage to 
know that they will go out to vote on sunday defense minister 
gen eugenio vides casanova said in a television interview 
there was virtually no traffic on the streets as the guerrilla 
transport ban took effect at midnight wednesday officials 
discovered tiny sharp threepronged devices scattered on city 
streets early thursday 
the army said it was providing protection for travelers on 80 
percent of the countrys highways but acknowledged late thursday 
that the traffic ban was 90 percent effective 
it is not support for the ban but fear that kept the buses off 
the highways said an army spokesman on usual condition of 
anonymity 
there were no additional reports of armed rebel activity late in 
the day most businesses in the capital were open but customers 
were few 
the farabundo marti national liberation front the umbrella 
coalition of five groups fighting the usbacked government 
decreed the ban after the failure of negotiations over its offer to 
participate in the election 
the fmln has no right to prevent the people from voting 
declared fidel chavez mena candidate of the incumbent christian 
democratic party 
guillermo ungo candidate of the leftist democratic convergence 
condemned the rebels for engaging in violence after having offered 
to join the political process 
they want to jump in bed but still remain a virgin said 
ungo whose alliance maintained close links with the fmln and gives 
voters the opportunity to vote for a leftist presidential candidate 
for the first time since 1979 
the other top candidate is alfredo cristiani of the conservative 
republican national alliance or arena polls show cristiani 
gathering the largest share of sundays vote but there is a high 
possibility for error due to the reluctance of many people to give 
their views 
in a statement released in mexico city the guerrillas said the 
election was an attempt to legitimize the war and to justify 
continued us arms shipments and aid 
the statement said the election would be a fraud in which the 
military would control the votes and the results however the 
rebel statement also said working for ungo was a valid option 
francisco merino arenas vice presidential candidate said the 
rebel ban and the wave of violence are an illogical mistake of the 
fmln 
they had been given an opportunity to show their sincerity in 
the proposal for peace their leadership is showing that they have 
no intention of paying attention to this call we and the people and 
the international community have made on them merino said 
nearly 18 million voters are registered to vote for president 
and vice president in addition to the top three there are four 
minor party candidates if no candidate receives more than 50 
percent on sunday the top two votegetters will face each other in 
a runoff 
the winner will take over the presidency from jose napoleon 
duarte the incumbent christian democrat on june 1 
the fmln on thursday urged all government election officials to 
quit their jobs and their guerrillas attacked a coffee storage 
facility and sabotaged electrical power lines one soldier was 
killed and four others wounded during a rebel attack the armed 
forces press office said 
appealing for calm vides casanova said we are going to hear 
some bombs and we are going to see sabotage and they will make us a 
bit nervous 
vides casanova acknowledged the rebels were capable of causing 
disruptions and referred to guerrilla sabotage during elections in 
1982 and 1985 
it is easy to disrupt electricity or to throw a bomb they have 
done that in the past he said the rebels boycotted previous 
elections this decade saying the voting was little more than part 
of a usdesigned counterinsurgency strategy still as many as 75 
percent of eligible voters went to the polls in 1985 
the guerrillas offered to take part in elections if they were 
postponed and other guarantees were put in place but negotiations 
with the political parties and the government stalled 
the army provided trucks under military escort to transport 
capital residents while a few private pickup trucks volunteered 
their services 
eight armored vehicles escorted a fourtruck convoy carrying 
passengers along a highway from san salvador to towns to the east 
the armed forces are here to protect you from the terrorists of 
the fmln a loudspeaker blared as the convoy departed a bus 
terminal 
previous bans have been effective because the guerrillas sabotage 
or burn vehicles that violate it reports from the countryside 
indicated the ban had virtually paralyzed traffic outside the 
capital

the transport department says it issued two 
warnings of a bomb plot in the month before pan am flight 103 blew 
up over scotland but the airline said thursday it never received 
the first warning and the second arrived weeks late by mail 
the times of london reported thursday night that police know the 
bombers identity and will disclose details next week but 
authorities denied reports in a british tabloid that a suspect was 
arrested 
transport secretary paul channon said the second warning two 
days before the dec 21 crash was of no importance whatsoever 
because the us federal aviation administration already issued its 
own warning to us carriers about the threat 
members of the opposition labor party accused the government of a 
coverup and demanded an investigation the transport department 
issued its statement wednesday night after a newspaper report of the 
warnings 
the warnings issued by the british government nov 22 and dec 
19 just two days before the disaster that killed 270 people spoke 
of a bomb hidden in a radiocassette player the transport 
department said 
police say they established that the explosives were in a 
radiocassette player planted in a suitcase stowed in the jumbo 
jets hold 
pan am said the transport departments dec 19 memo did not reach 
it until jan 17 and that it never received the nov 22 warning in 
new york company spokeswoman pamela hanlon acknowledged pan am did 
receive the faa warning nov 18 and as a result put into place 
some heightened security procedures but she declined to elaborate 
flight 103 originated in frankfurt changing to a boeing 747 in 
london it blew up over lockerbie scotland killing all 259 people 
aboard and 11 on the ground 
the times reported in its friday issue early copies of which 
were available thursday night police and security service 
investigators now know precisely who made and placed the bomb and 
the whereabouts of the bomber 
the results of what whitehall british government sources term 
one of the most remarkable feats of criminal detection ever known 
are expected to be disclosed next week 
it is understood that mr channon has already discussed the 
findings in outline with dr jurgen warnke his west german 
counterpart the times said without giving any further details 
authorities denied a report friday by the london tabloid today 
that said the terrorist who planted the bomb was under arrest 
somewhere in europe 
a police spokesman in frankfurt west germany quoted by the 
british domestic news agency press association said he knew nothing 
about any terrorists being held in connection with the bombing a 
spokesman at the scottish office the british government department 
responsible for scotland described the report as pure 
speculation 
a photostat of the dec 19 warning published by the daily mirror 
showed it addressed to all uk airlines and el al air india 
us airlines south african airways 
the mirror said the notice advised security authorities to look 
for telltale signs that the instrument wouldnt play its insides 
would rattle the xray would show more wiring than usual and the 
antenna socket would be taped shut 
suspicions of a bomb plot arose in october when west german 
police caught a palestinian terrorist group with a radiocassette 
player containing explosives and a barometric device that would 
detonate a bomb at high altitude according to british and west 
german officials 
we sent advice to the relevant security authorities the 
transport department said in its statement they were told what to 
look for the american authorities would have done the same for 
american airlines 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman said the 
arrests in west germany also prompted the faa issued a warning nov 
18 that told of the terrorist group the existence of this bomb 
its characteristics and to advise that increased security measures 
should be introduced to counter this threat 
this bulletin remains in effect today he added 
on dec 5 the us embassy in helsinki was warned in a telephone 
call of a plot to bomb a pan am airliner on a frankfurtus flight 
during a twoweek period in december the faa issued an 
intelligence alert that there might be a bomb attempt against a 
pan am flight from frankfurt 
speaking on bbctv channon said the nov 22 warning was sent to 
british airlines and airports and of course the federal aviation 
administration sent out their own warning to the american airlines 
asked about pan ams statement that it didnt get the second 
warning until jan 17 channon said there is no importance to it 
whatsoever all it contained virtually was a color photograph of a 
cassette player and a few more unimportant pieces of information 
about how a bomb in frankfurt had been constructed 
he said the evidence that the bomb was placed aboard the plane at 
londons heathrow airport is very slender indeed all the 
evidence seems to point the other way 
asked if this meant he was blaming us and west german 
authorities for failing to prevent the bombing he said i dont 
make any comment about that thats for the investigators to decide 
and for the police west german authorities say there is no firm 
evidence that the bomb was smuggled aboard in frankfurt 
in frankfurt manfred langendorf chief of the hesse state 
interior ministrys office for airport security said thursday all 
airlines operating in west germany including pan am were told in 
early november about the radiocassette player containing explosives 
david wilshire of britains governing conservative party who 
follows air transport affairs denied suggestions authorities simply 
dropped a highly sensitive warning into the christmas mail deluge 
he said the dec 19 warning was sent by telex and the mailed 
versions were courtesy copies he said that pan am in any case had 
received one of the november warnings 
wilshire said security officials at londons heathrow airport 
built a mock bomb after the nov 22 warning to run through xray 
machines but added that the machines scan only carryon bags and 
airlines are responsible for checked luggage 
labor party transport spokesman john prescott said the 
governments responses were just not good enough the government 
are covering up lets have a public inquiry 
elizabeth deludedix an american whose irish husband was killed 
on flight 103 said im bewildered and also very angry 
now we know that the government had information which told them 
the carrier that would be affected pan american the origin of the 
flight frankfurt that the threatened period was during the month 
of december and now weve learned that they also had information 
about the exact kind of bomb that was used 
if security authorities had only looked at all the information 
at their disposal they could perhaps have prevented this she said

advocates for the homeless and state and 
congressional housing experts on wednesday criticized a federal 
panel charged with coordinating programs for the homeless saying it 
had done virtually nothing to provide shelter for people without 
housing 
the complaints about the interagency council on the homeless came 
at a joint hearing of two house subcommittees wednesday while the 
senate subcommittee on housing introduced legislation its sponsors 
touted as the framework for a new national housing strategy 
the litany of the councils failures began in the opening 
statement from rep cardiss collins dill who chairs the 
government activities and transportation subcommittee of the 
committee on government operations 
it didnt hold meetings it didnt set policy it didnt 
coordinate federal programs it didnt assess the needs of the 
homeless it didnt recommend legislative changes or funding 
levels said collins 
it has failed almost completely to carry out the mandates set 
for it by congress she said 
the council established in 1987 by title ii of the mckinney act 
was given the responsibility to coordinate 20 new programs created 
by the law monitor implementation of programs to the homeless 
disseminate information about the programs to local governments and 
nonprofit organizations serving the homeless and help them develop 
new programs 
but rep tom lantos dcalif chairman of the employment and 
housing subcommittee and cohost of wednesdays hearing said much of 
the information that homeless providers needed to apply for mckinney 
funds was provided instead by the national governors association 
wendy adler of the nga testified that after receiving numerous 
requests from the states for information she had developed and 
updated three times a report on the status of programs under the 
mckinney act and related legislation 
this publication contains the type of information the council 
should be disseminating said adler chiding the council for not 
fulfilling its most basic mandate 
other witnesses said the council has failed to develop a complete 
staff identify regional and field coordinators for programs and to 
clarify their duties focused too much on the development of an 
electronic data base which homeless providers could not use missed 
application deadlines met only five times in 18 months and 
produced only three monthly newsletters which contained useless 
information 
the council comprised of the heads or their designees of 10 
cabinet departments and five independent agencies was headed by 
former housing secretary sam pierce lantos joked that the late 
elvis presley had been seen more often on capitol hill than pierce 
the duties with which the council is charged and its ability to 
carry them out must be brought into balance said cassandra moore 
the councils former executive director 
she said congress gave the council broad authority to develop 
programs and issue timetables but not the power or resources to 
fulfill its mandate as described in mckinney 
moore also recommended increasing the staff size and removing the 
council from under the administrative wing of the department of 
housing and urban development she said hud had been resistant to 
sharing information on homelessness and virtually noncommunicative 
but hud had provided administrative support to the council on a 
continuing basis according to james stimpson a deputy assistant 
housing secretary 
he said the new administration has made homelessness one of its 
highest priorities and sees the council as an effective partner 
in addressing the problem

israels hawkish industry minister and former 
defense chief ariel sharon said thursday that yasser arafat should 
be killed and the israeli army should destroy his palestine 
liberation organization 
sharon who was architect of israels disastrous 1982 invasion of 
lebanon demanded a worldwide jewish effort to end the dialogue 
between the united states and the palestinians 
our goal must be their the plos destruction the outspoken 
sharon said in an interview on israel radio we should have killed 
arafat long ago 
he was among rightwing cabinet ministers from prime minister 
yitzhak shamirs political party the likud bloc who rejected on 
thursday a suggestion by us secretary of state james a baker iii 
that israel talk with the plo 
but a leading palestinian figure on thursday praised bakers 
comment 
salah khalaf second in command to arafat in fatah the main plo 
guerrilla group described as positive and practical bakers 
statement before a congressional hearing that israel might have to 
negotiate with the plo 
not bad not bad at all mr baker khalaf also known as abu 
iyad was quoted as saying in a telephone interview from tunis with 
the londonbased newsletter mideast mirror a copy of the interview 
was telexed to the associated press 
shamirs spokesman avi pazner disclosed on thursday that the 
prime minister has been holding secret meetings since last december 
with palestinian leaders who do not belong to the plo 
pazner confirmed a report on israel tv that secret meetings were 
under way 
he told the associated press its purpose is to have a dialogue 
with nonplo palestinians he has been meeting with nonplo 
palestinians and he will continue to do so 
he declined to identify the palestinians saying it could 
endanger their lives 
on wednesday shamirs foreign minister moshe arens had reacted 
strongly to bakers suggestions that israel consider talks directly 
with the plo if other peace avenues fail 
arens who is visiting the united states before an expected april 
trip by shamir expressed his displeasure with bakers statements to 
congresssional committees in a 20minute telephone call to baker 
pazner said shamirs talks should not be misconstrued as support 
for bakers suggestion 
there will be no negotiations with the plo pazner said 
shamir repeatedly has rejected all talks with the plo contending 
it is a terrorist group but he says he is willing to talk with 
nonplo palestinians in the occupied territories to try to achieve 
peace 
most palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip reject this 
approach insisting that the plo is their representative the 
israeli government contends they have been frightened into taking 
this position for fear of reprisal 
deputy foreign minister benjamin netanyahu said bakers 
statements sabotaged israels efforts to draw nonplo palestinians 
into the peace process 
if we say ahead of time that these partners arent to be found 
if we say lets move on to the radicals then we are sabatoging 
attempts to find the moderates he told army radio 
deputy prime minister david levy told israel radio this nation 
has decided not to commit suicide israel will not allow the 
establishment of a palestinian state because it is a danger to our 
existence 
what do we have to talk about with the plo the weather the 
koran the torah 
the reference was to the holy books of islam and judaism 
finance minister shimon peres leader of the centerleft labor 
party was more accepting of bakers idea 
if the plo has ideas we will not censor them he told israel 
television we will not negotiate with an organization that 
engages in terror but a nation yes if the nation identifies with 
this organization we cannot censor their views 
israels two largest independent daily newspapers maariv and 
yediot ahronot on thursday carried banner headlines portraying the 
arensbaker dispute as a major conflict over middle east policies 
in damascus the democratic front for the liberation of 
palestine a marxist faction of the plo on thursday condemned 
meetings between palestinians in the occupied territories and 
israeli government officials 
in the last few months a series of meetings have taken place 
between members of israels civil administration in the occupied 
territories and prominent palestinians 
those contacts run by the civil administration only aim at 
creating tension and divisions in an attempt to ease the 
international anger against israels fascist ways at curbing the 
peoples uprising against israeli rule a democratic front 
spokesman said speaking on the condition of anonymity 
he said his organization supports talks between leftwing israeli 
peace activists and palestinian leaders 
shamir has revealed no details of the new peace plan he is 
expected to advance while in america he has hinted it will call for 
some kind of interim autonomy while a longterm solution is 
worked out for the occupied lands 
this approach parallels the proposal in the usbrokered 1978 
camp david peace accords with egypt the plo and most arab nations 
have rejected it as unworkable

chile seized five japanese fishing boats 
thursday in reprisal for japans closing of its market to chilean 
fruit because of a cyanide scare 
also thursday president augusto pinochet said the amount of 
cyanide found in two chilean grapes in philadelphia wouldnt even 
kill a mouse and called us warnings about chilean fruit 
exaggerated 
they tried to kill a fly with a tank pinochet said of the 
us caution to consumers while he visited a fruit packing house 
then he ate several grapes 
us ambassador charles gillespie defended the us action but 
added we are all trying to get chilean products back on the us 
market as fast as is humanly possible 
navy captain patricio urbina was quoted by the official news 
agency orbe as saying the five japanese trawlers were held in the 
ports of talcahuano chacabuco and punta arenas in southern chile 
orbe also quoted urbina as saying a sixth japanese boat in 
waters near antarctica will be seized when it arrives at a chilean 
port 
adm jose merino navy commanderinchief told reporters the 
japanese have closed their market to chilean fruits so im holding 
their ships 
none of them is going to fish in our waters until they reopen 
the market to our fruits said merino who is also president of 
the lawmaking military junta 
late thursday naval sources said two of the seized japanese 
vessels were docked for repairs the sources said the vessels were 
registered in chile but operating leased by unidentified japanese 
fishing companies 
an anonymous caller on thursday claimed a rocket would be fired 
at the us embassy in santiago police checked a nearby building

packing houses near santiago where a worker handed the president 
and army commander a cluster of seedless white grapes saying mr 
president these are the grapes they claim are poisoned

business and trade union organizations say thousands of workers 
have been fired as a result of the measure against the nations 
booming fruit export industry the industry employs 500000 workers 
and exports 65 percent of its products to the united states 
what worries me most is you the workers im studying a 
compensation for you all the president said 
pinochet told workers he expects a solution to the problem 
probably within the next five days or so 
the government said it increased security measures throughout the 
fruit export sector including reinforcing controls in the fields 
packing houses in transportation and ports 
chileans have reacted angrily to the us warnings on thursday 
hundreds gathered before the us consulate in santiago carrying 
sigs reading mr bush chilean fruits are ok and chile 
demands compensation 
trucks loaded with fruit were taken to the demonstration site 
and free grapes and apples were distributed to the people many ate 
them others took them home 
government officials and private businessmen have said the crisis 
will cost chile up to 1 billion in lost fruit exports which have 
become one of chiles most successful economic items in recent years 
last year fruit exports earned 581 million and had been 
expected to bring in 850 million this year

intelligence agent wednesday in a manila suburb and the military 
said nine other people were slain in clashes between insurgents and 
government forces 
police said patrolman leandro serrano was in his jeep preparing 
to leave for work in suburban navotas when five gunmen opened fire 
killing him instantly 
the assailants who escaped left a note signed by the alex 
boncayao brigade saying serrano was slain because he was assigned to 
a police counterintelligence unit 
the alex boncayao brigade is the manila wing of the new peoples 
army which has been waging a 20year insurgency to establish a 
communist state 
on mindanao island 500 miles southeast of manila the military 
said three rebels and three soldiers were killed monday in lanao del 
norte province

would be courtmartialed for embezzlement or misappropriation of 
funds 
the military command has come under increasing pressure from 
congress the public and the news media to eliminate corruption 
which flourished in the 160000member army during the 20year 
administration of president ferdinand marcos marcos was ousted in 
1986 
also wednesday president corazon aquino told reporters she had 
approved in principle a package of reforms and other measures her 
government will undertake as a condition for 13 billion in imf 
loans 
she said a letter of intent accepting the imf terms will be 
forwarded to fund headquarters in washington after a review by the 
philippine senate 
formal approval also will pave the way for 16 billion more in 
new loans from commercial banks and for talks with foreign creditors 
to reschedule up to 2 billion of the countrys 28 billion foreign 
debt 
in its letter of intent the government pledges to reduce the 
budget deficit by improved tax collection to liberalize imports 
regulations and to disband or sell off most of its stateowned 
businesses 
it also agrees to continue a floating exchange rate which has 
seen the peso lose about three percent of its value against the us 
dollar in the past year 
critics contend the government cannot meet the terms of the 
package without raising prices for electric power transport and 
food

fbi agents who searched a st 
petersburg lawyers office found further evidence linking him to the 
disappearance of a mississippi millionaires wife a prosecutor told 
a federal magistrate wednesday 
us magistrate harvey schlesinger ordered the lawyer newton 
alfred winn held without bond and returned to mississippi to stand 
trial on federal charges of extortion and perjury in the kidnapping 
of 73yearold annie laurie hearin 
mrs hearin wife of jackson miss businessman robert hearin 
disappeared on july 26 1988 and has not been found although her 
husband complied with a ransom note 
while winn is not charged with the womans kidnapping he is 
charged with extortion for hiring a woman to mail a note from mrs 
hearin to her husband urging him to comply with a ransom demand 
he also faces charges of lying to a federal grand jury on aug 3 
when he denied any knowledge of the disappearance fbi officials 
said 
assistant us attorney stephen kunz said agents searched winns 
combination home and law office and found a map of jackson miss 
with the location of the hearins home circled also marked were the 
locations of businesses and a littleknown farm owed by the hearins 
the agents seized six aerial maps of jackson an old royal 
typewriter a 9mm semiautomatic gun and a 38caliber revolver 
the fbi has concluded that a royal typewriter manufactured 
between 1912 and 1926 was used to type the ransom note for mrs 
hearin investigators are conducting tests on the typewriter found 
at winns home to see if it was used to type the ransom note kunz 
said 
kunz also said a neighbor of the hearins identified winn from a 
photo lineup as a man she had seen in a white van in the 
neighborhood a few days before the kidnapping 
fbi agent thomas montgomery testified that winn paid a woman 
friend 500 to fly to atlanta and mail a letter written by the 
kidnap victim a couple weeks after the kidnapping the letter urged 
hearin to meet the ransom demand 
the day after receiving the note hearin paid out almost 1 
million to the 12 men listed in the ransom note including winn who 
returned the money 
winn 64 who served as his own attorney for the hearing stood 
up near the end of the hearing and said much of this surprises 
me 
winn and the 11 others listed in the ransom note to hearin were 
current or former franchise holders of school pictures inc in 
which hearin owned controlling interest the corporation had sued 
all 12 claiming they owed the company money and won a judgment 
against winn of about 150000 
hearins worth reportedly exceeds 100 million he is coowner of 
mississippi valley gas co and coowner of yazoo manufacturing co

eight days after completing an alchoholism 
rehabilitation program kitty dukakis was back on the lecture 
circuit wednesday addressing college students on the lack of women 
in politics 
the wife of the massachussets governor and failed democratic 
presidential candidate michael dukakis arrived at villanova 
university wearing a soft cast on her left ankle to protect 
ligaments torn in a fall earlier this week 
she discussed her alchoholism with reporters before her speech 
theres a word with my disease and thats called recovering 
she said ill always be recovering and i hope ill be able to 
follow the steps of the program that will be a part of my life 
mrs dukakis said she feels encouraged about her future and 
frequently described her outlook as positive 
mrs dukakis was hospitalized in february for alchoholism 
rehabilitation at edgehill newport in newport ri for 31 days 
she has said her drinking began shortly after the november 
election but as she did at a news conference shortly after her 
release last tuesday she refused wednesday to blame the campaign 
for her drinking 
in her speech mrs dukakis said alcoholism or drug abuse knows 
no barriers of class race or sex 
contemporary society still reserves a special stigma a modern 
letter of scarlet for women who become dependent on drugs whether 
liquid or solid she said 
women are accustomed to struggles she said as is seen in 
womens efforts to get ahead in politics 
no area of political involvement is more important for women 
today than that of fund raising here through networks of friends 
associates and neighbors we have a golden opportunity to make a 
significant impact all across the country she said 
mrs dukakis said she hasnt had a chance to form an opinion of 
the bush administration because she was not allowed to watch 
television news or read newspapers during her treatment 
in 1982 she overcame a 26year addiction to diet pills 
she said she is working on a book about the presidential campaign 
and will continue speaking around the country 
before being hospitalized for alchohol addiction she had 
delivered three speeches on various topics in los angeles and 
florida

convicted massmurder charles manson has 
been transferred from san quentin state prison to a new maximum 
security unit in the san joaquin valley a prison official said 
wednesday 
lt evelyn mazon said manson one of the most notorious of 
californias 78000 convicts was sent to corcoran state prison this 
week to be housed in the states toughest new maximum security unit 
san quentin is undergoing a major change in mission from a 
maximumsecurity prison to a mediumsecurity prison said mike van 
winkle a corrections department spokesman 
manson is among 957 highrisk inmates who have been transferred 
to the 253 million corcoran prison since it opened 13 months ago 
the prisons population on wednesday was 3576 inmates 
officials did not name any other wellknown inmates now housed in 
the facility roughly midway between los angeles and san francisco 
and about 200 miles southeast of san quentin 
manson 52 has spent nearly all of his adult life in federal and 
state prisons 
he had been on parole less than two years from the federal prison 
at terminal island near los angeles when his manson family cult 
followers murdered actress sharon tate coffee heiress abigail 
folger polish filmmaker voityk frykowski and six others in a 
monthlong murder spree in 1969 
manson was convicted of masterminding and ordering the tate and 
other murders in an effort to trigger a race war that he believed 
was foretold in the beatles song helter skelter 
manson is serving a life sentence for the tate murders but is 
technically eligible for consideration for parole if the state 
board of prison terms considered him suitable for release 
at his latest hearing 13 months ago the board again turned down 
parole for three years the longest period allowed without 
additional review board member albert leddy at that time said it 
was highly unlikely that manson who has been turned down seven 
times for parole ever would be released

mikhail s gorbachev has proposed solving the 
crushing food crisis by doing away with centralized agricultural 
planning and letting farmers lease land decide what to plant and 
sell their crops at freemarket prices 
the soviet president said his bold bid to gradually dismantle a 
bulwark of stalinism represents an agrarian policy that will be 
able to restore the peasant as the master on the land and dependably 
solve the food problem 
gorbachev said the amount of grain that rots on its way to market 
due to inefficiency 40 million tons is equal to the amount of 
grain the country must import 
he told the communist partys policymaking central committee on 
wednesday that the government must give farmers more control over 
land and crops and allow market forces to set prices

internal revenue service employees in some 
parts of the country are giving correct answers to telephoned tax 
questions barely half the time the irs says 
nationwide say auditors for the general accounting office the 
irs is correct only 60 percent of the time not the 69 percent 
claimed by the irs less than a week ago some of the answers that 
irs considers correct could lead taxpayers to foul up their returns 
gao said 
robert lebaube irs director of taxpayer services quarreled with 
the gao estimate but only slightly as far as the irs is 
concerned whether we are answering 30 percent of the questions 
wrong or 40 percent of the questions wrong either number is 
absolutely unacceptable he told the house government operations 
consumer subcommittee wednesday 
the irs own tests of its telephoneassistance system indicate a 
performance no better than last years even though employees have 
had an extra year to acquaint themselves with the big 1986 tax 
overhaul while the irs figures it is correct 69 percent of the time 
nationally in some of the 29 calling sites the accuracy rate is in 
the 50s and in others it is in the 70s lebaube said

nearly 30 years after independence 
zaire says it is time for belgium to atone for the years it held the 
west african country as the colony known as the belgian congo 
president mobutu sese seko argues that belgium exploited his 
country before and after it gained independence in 1960 
we were cheated by belgium he said recently 
our good faith was abused now that we are equals we want to 
put everything into question again 
he insists that belgium has a moral duty to do more to help zaire 
out of its 7 billion foreign debt 
he intends to raise the question at a toplevel ministerial 
conference tentatively set for sometime this spring 
for its part belgium says it is ready to discuss a rescheduling 
of zaires debt but will not renegotiate the treaties it signed with 
zaire in 1965 or discuss the way it granted independence almost 
overnight in 1960 
belgianzairean relations have been punctuated by criticism here 
on grounds that mobutus rule is authoritarian and disregards human 
rights and by complaints in zaire about belgian shortcomings in 
helping its former colony 
zaire contents that prime minister wilfried martens of belgium 
on a visit in november was hardly generous in helping to ease 
zaires foreign debt 
yet martens offer forgiving 25 million of the 125 million 
zaire owes belgium was large enough to renew criticism in the 
belgian media and parliament about the way mobutu has run his nation 
since he seized power in a 1965 coup 
an angry mobutu said he would have broken relations with belgium 
had king hassan ii of morocco not proposed to mediate 
zaire insists the ministerial meeting this spring should touch on 
old colonial disputes 
the investigation of the disputes will show exactly who owes 
what to whom mobutu said 
he added that unless belgium agrees to discuss colonial times he 
will go to the international court of justice in the hague 
netherlands also known as the world court 
mobutu claims belgium exploited his nations mineral wealth 
before and after independence and keeping all the proceeds 
some here agree belgium owes zaire a moral debt but question 
mobutus timing and motives for bringing the matter up now 
belgium has a historical debt said economic affairs minister 
minister willy claes but discovering these socalled truths 25 
years late is not very credible 
politically colonization was a debacle and largely linked to 
belgiums attitude said jeanclaude williame of the african study 
and documentation center in brussels but you cannot convert the 
moral argument into money 
king leopold ii gained personal control of the congo in 1885 and 
imposed a regime of forced labor 
in his book red rubber leopold ii and his congo the africa 
specialist daniel vangroenweghe wrote that the harshness of the 
regime and disease depleted half the colonys population in 40 years 
leopold had earned a personal fortune and the scorn of world 
public opinion when the belgian state took control of the territory 
from him in 1908 
i will give them my congo leopold said at the time but 
they have no right to know what i did there 
several belgian companies made their fortunes in the congo in the 
past century among them societe generale de belgique sa which today 
is belgiums largest holding company 
four belgian companies all controlled by societe generale now 
are drawing a net benefit from zaire of about 300 million a year 
largely through mining and refining of zairean copper diamonds and 
cobalt 
belgium is zaires fourth largest creditor after the united 
states france and west germany 
mobutu known in zaire as the savior guide rejects charges 
that he is authoritarian with little regard for human rights and 
that he has enriched himself at the expense of his 34 million people 
his response is that he saved zaire from political chaos 
restored law and order and created a nation out of a kaleidoscope of 
ethnic tribes 
if i think what the country owes me he said i get weak 
inside and tears well in my eyes 
his critics however point to his sizable real estate holdings 
across europe his palatial residence in his hometown of gbadolite 
and a personal fortune said to run into billions of dollars

five members of a new generation of american 
film actress are in competition for the 61st academy award for best 
leading role and the power of their performances makes the race one 
of the toughest oscar calls in years 
meryl streep has become an academy award regular this years a 
cry in the dark marking her eighth nomination two have resulted 
in oscars as supporting actress in kramer vs kramer 1979 
and best actress in sophies choice 1982 
in a cry in the dark the 39yearold actress again portrayed 
a martyred woman the reallife australian housewife named lindy 
chamberlain who spent three years in prison after being convicted 
of killing her infant daughter she insisted the child had been 
carried off by a dingo a wild australian dog she was finally 
exonerated last september 
as in sophies choice out of africa and other films 
streep affected an accent i get a lot of flak for my accents 
she admitted in a recent magazine interview 
she has no intention of changing her acting style because of the 
kidding but adds once in a while i think it would be a relief to 
play a housewife trying to raise three kids keep her husband and 
organize her neighbors to fight pesticides 
glenn close the scheming marquise of dangerous liaisons has 
a remarkable oscar record of her own having been nominated for five 
of her eight films but so far no wins 
close 41 was named for supporting actress in the world 
according to garp the big chill and the natural and for 
a leading role in the terrifying fatal attraction last year 
since the beginning of time weve been trying to figure out 
who we are in relation to the opposite sex and then how to relate 
to them she has said both fatal attraction and dangerous 
liaisons deal with that theme in different ways when it comes to 
sexual identity were living in very unsettled times 
for former child star jodie foster the academy nomination for 
the accused confirms her emergence as a mature actress the 
recognition might help erase the notoriety caused by john hinkley 
jrs attempted assassination of president reagan hinkley had 
attempted to impress foster upon whom he had fixated after seeing 
her in taxi driver 14 times 
her role as the prostitute in taxi driver won her a 
nomination as supporting actress at the age of 13 now 26 she was 
nominated as the brassy waitress who is gangraped in the backroom 
of a tavern 
of the accused role she comments i like her i think the 
audience likes her there are probably moments when they dont like 
her but shes human she has flaws she says the wrong things she 
can be loud and she repeats herself 
shes somebody you can know which makes the issue of what 
rape is all about it becomes even more cruel when it happens to 
someone you know 
sigourney weaver 39 finds herself in the peculiar position of 
being nominated as lead actress for gorillas in the mist and 
for support in working girl it last happened to jessica lange 
in 1982 who was nominated as best actress in frances she lost 
to streep in sophies choice and won for supporting actress in 
tootsie 
as the late naturalist dian fossey weaver did what most other 
stars would never consider she worked intimately with wild gorillas 
she discounts the danger involved i was reading a lot of 
dians papers and rereading her book and it seemed that she was 
often threatened by gorillas but they never actually hurt her it 
was all a question of getting to know each other 
i didnt see why they would feel animosity toward me that was 
a lucky choice on my part i dont think it would have been wise to 
go in and work with animals without having previously reassured 
yourself that you would be all right 
melanie griffith has been in the news with her reengagement to 
don johnson of tvs miami vice they were divorced 12 years ago 
and are expecting a child the oscar could bring added joy to the 
31yearold daughter of actress tippi hedren who starred in alfred 
hitchcocks the birds 
griffith is nominated as the wily ambitious tess mcgill who 
rises swiftly from the secretarial pool to corporate boardrooms in 
working girl 
tess correlated a lot with me and my career the actress 
remarked in a recent article like saying ok im going to do 
this part because i know i can thats what tess did and i feel 
thats what ive done against everybody saying oh youre just a 
sexpot or a nymphet or youre a problem you drink too much you 
do drugs or youre wild 
griffith had a wild youth and appeared nude in early films also 
seminude while vacuuming in working girl but the movie world 
took her more seriously after her kooky lulu in the 1986 something 
wild

fifty years after his appointment to the 
supreme court and nine years after his death william o douglas 
remains a source of strong emotions in the state that shaped his 
life and his opinions 
a critical documentary is scheduled to air next month a major 
symposium on douglas career is planned in seattle newly released 
government files reveal an fbi scheme to discredit him and the 
state legislature is considering the 100000 purchase of his 
cascade mountain hideaway for a public memorial 
he is a compelling figure said walt lowe whose documentary 
is to air on public television stations the strength of his 
personality the magnitude of his work he was a person who saw a 
chance to do good and he did it 
douglas was raised in poverty in yakima graduated from whitman 
college in walla walla then taught high school here for two years 
before deciding in 1922 to become a lawyer after serving as a law 
professor lawyer and chairman of the securities and exchange 
commission he was nominated to the supreme court on march 20 1939 
by president franklin d roosevelt 
during 36 years on the high court douglas wrote a record 1200 
decision 
he was a consistent supporter of abortion rights first amendment 
press protections the environment and the rights of criminal 
suspects including the controversial miranda decision he used his 
position to oppose racism in schools and us army surveillance of 
vietnam war protesters 
the supreme court recently overturned some affirmative action 
programs and will hear arguments on a case that could affect its 
landmark ruling legalizing abortion so douglas views remain 
important said hg locke organizer of the threeday seattle 
symposium scheduled to begin april 15 it will look at him as 
environmentalist internationalist civil libertarian and as a man 
lowes documentary funded by the pacific mountain network of the 
public broadcasting system and produced by kyve of yakima is 
scheduled to air in the west on april 17 the anniversary of 
douglas elevation to the court 
it paints an unflattering portrait of douglas domineering mother 
and includes a scathing attack by his daughter a discussion of his 
four marriages and his extramarital affairs and interviews with 
former clerks who remember a driving perfectionist with little 
regard for their personal lives 
what emerges is a picture of an egotistical often unpleasant 
man deeply scarred by early poverty who rose primarily through his 
brilliance 
douglas daughter mildred read remembers a distant father with 
little time or use for his children he didnt want to be talked 
to at breakfast because he was reading the paper he didnt know 
what to do with us 
his first clerk david ginsberg now a washington dc lawyer 
recalled a stern boss there was never a thought that i was 
overburdened 
ms read said her father had many affairs moving on as he grew 
tired of each woman mercedes eichholz douglas second wife whose 
lengthy affair with the justice broke up his first marriage after 29 
years said his pursuit was so hot and heavy he wore me down 
the portland oregonian reported in january that secret fbi files 
showed a pattern of misdeeds against douglas covering two decades 
and including former president nixons attempt to impeach him in 
1970 the fbi first began keeping tabs on him in the early 1950s 
when former gov arthur langlie wrote to us attorney general 
herbert brownell that communists were regular guests at douglas 
summer home in la push 
more than three decades later state officials are once again 
concerned with one of douglas summer homes but this time they 
wish to honor the native son a bill has been introduced in the 
house that seeks to purchase the alpine cabin that douglas built in 
1965 near goose prairie about 25 miles east of mount rainier in the 
cascade mountains 
a us forest service report issued last tuesday noted that 
turning the cabin site into a wilderness studies institute would be 
appropriate using the property would encourage an understanding 
of wilderness principles said don rotell of the forest service 
cathy douglas stone the jurists fourth wife put the home up 
for sale last year if it becomes a public memorial she has agreed 
to return many of the furnishings and memorabilia to the 
chaletstyle dwelling

since lowlevel radioactive waste dumps moved in 
nearby two communities have had opposite relationships with their 
nuclear neighbors in sheffield ill there have been lawsuits and 
worries in beatty nev the dump is called a good neighbor 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
this gray illinois prairie has been home 
to coal and crops but it was something alien in the soil that gave 
rise to 10 years of litigation and a legacy that could linger for 
centuries 
deep in the earth among tons of waste in a longclosed dump a 
radioactive substance called tritium is leaking from dirt trenches 
in which it was buried 
though experts say this form of hydrogen from nuclear power 
plants factories and research labs isnt enough to pose any danger 
the leak illustrates the potential risks of such dumps 
nobody knows how to safely bury hazardous waste for the length 
of time the waste will be hazardous argues hugh kaufman a 
government whistleblower who now works at the us environmental 
protection agency its all supposition and prayer 
others say the industry has come a long way since the late 1960s 
when the lowlevel nuclear waste dump opened in sheffield still 
scientists concede that while tests to determine the suitability of 
the sheffield area were considered sufficient then theyd be 
terribly inadequate by current standards 
in the mid60s not much was known about the regulation of 
lowlevel waste disposal said dave ed senior nuclear scientist 
at the illinois department of nuclear safety weve learned an 
awful lot in 20 years weve learned before you ok a site you 
should do a very thorough investigation weve learned it after the 
fact in sheffield 
by todays standards that site shouldnt or wouldnt be 
used said ed noting the soil is too sandy and gravelly allowing 
water to move distances in six months that experts originally 
thought would take hundreds of years 
ed says the dump has a mixed record 
it didnt contain the radioactivity as predicted he said 
but it continues to isolate the radioactivity from people 
that doesnt satisfy local activist stanley gingrich who heads a 
citizens group that has opposed the dump as well as an adjacent one 
filled with nonnuclear hazardous waste that is also leaking 
it has to be one of the biggest blights in this country he 
said 
even those who believe the operators were conscientious say it 
doesnt do a community any good to be near two leaking dumps 
its definitely been a deficit to us said businessman bob 
sprowls adding like anybody else i dont know whats out there 
im not smart enough to know what the real danger is 
the 20acre dump located about 3 miles from this westcentral 
town of 1100 is in a former strip mining area now dotted with 
farms 
it holds about 33 million cubic feet of lowlevel radioactive 
waste including contaminated tools and clothes from hospitals and 
nuclear power plants 100 pounds of plutonium and uranium and parts 
of a dismantled nuclear reactor all buried in 22 trenches 
the dump was closed in 1978 when the state refused to allow the 
operators then nuclear engineering co to bury waste in a new 
trench the state said tritium which also is used in most modern 
bombs was leaking and the ground was too sandy 
nuclear engineering decided to leave 
the company put the keys to the gate on the table in one of the 
sheds and sent us a telegram saying we have finished our work at 
the site since you own it its yours again said clifford 
weaver a private attorney who represented the state 
the state filed a 97 million lawsuit charged the company had 
broken its 99year lease a judge ordered the company which in 1981 
became us ecology inc to remain there until trial 
a decade later an outofcourt settlement was reached us 
ecology will commit more than 8 million to test monitor and 
maintain the area remain there until 1998 and build a new 
4footthick clay cover over the dump 
state officials insist the agreement is fair gingrich disagrees 
we think our community was sold out not having any input in 
that settlement he said eight million dollars and theyre able 
to walk away in 10 years we think 8 million is peanuts to take 
care of that site 
as part of the 1988 agreement us ecology also purchased a 
170acre buffer zone and built a fence around it after it was 
discovered tritium had moved beyond the dump into nearby groundwater 
and a lake 
that angers gingrich the states bandaid has been to allow 
them to buy more property where its leaking he said we cant 
say theres devalued land next to it because they bought the land 
it can move to the end of town and they can continue to buy the 
land can they buy the town eventually 
but ed says the land has been thoroughly studied and experts feel 
the leak can be contained within the buffer zone until the 
radioactivity decays most he said will be gone within 100 years 
ed also said the highest levels of tritium which leaked because 
earthen covers didnt prevent rain from seeping into the radioactive 
material amount to only 10 percent of the maximum the government 
allows to be released to unrestricted areas 
the levels were talking about you cant build bombs he 
explained noting the same was true of the plutonium which is 
thoroughly dispersed 
however the plutonium and uranium will remain hundreds of years 
and though its unlikely theyll move people must be prevented from 
digging into the waste the site has to be monitored and 
maintained for a hundred years at least he said 
though one legal battle is over a 9yearold lawsuit is pending 
over us ecologys 45acre nonnuclear hazardous waste site 
chemicals are leaking from the 43 million cubic feet of waste and 
some of the chemicals have apparently mixed with the tritium 
us ecology also is spending more than 13 million to study the 
scope of that problem and seek remedies 
meanwhile the company started holding community forums last year 
to keep the town informed of its work 
the site is a mystery to a lot of people said mark cade the 
sites post operations manager the word radioactive puts 
everybody on guard by being more open than we had in the past 
it would give them an opportunity for a better understanding of what 
goes on out there 
theyre trying to communicate more than they used to 
confirmed mayor jack weber before they did things they didnt 
tell us about the public relations is better now

livein star chris young is cbss great young 
hope to become a teen tv heartthrob like nbcs jason bateman of 
the hogan family and abcs kirk cameron on growing pains 
cbs in need of younger viewers has two new family sitcoms 
premiering monday that are designed to lure them 
livein just might entice teenagers if cbs can get them to 
tune in to begin with the network hasnt fared well in the 
halfhour comedy area and its kidappeal highschool drama tv 
101 has been passed over in the ratings 
the new shows will move into the time periods vacated by 
newhart and kate amp allie which move to later in the night 
replacing almost grown which is on hold 
livein has two appealing young stars young and lisa 
patrick a likable sitcom family sprightly writing and enough 
daring to avoid yawn inducement in teens long jaded by sexually 
exploitative films it airs opposite nbcs kidappeal hit alf 
preceding livein is heartland a farm family sitcom 
thats kind of a little roseanne on the prairie its opposite 
the hogan family 
cbs is hoping young will have the same teen appeal as bateman and 
cameron he plays danny a typically girlcrazy kid who cant 
believe his luck when his parents hire a charming australian au pair 
girl lisa patrick to care for their infant daughter 
lisa trots around in crop tops and miniskirts but expertly fends 
off the advances of danny and his obnoxious friend gator 
lightfield lewis who shows up the morning after she has moved in 
and sensitively queries danny so dya boff her yet to placate 
those who arent enchanted by simpleminded sex jokes good sense 
ultimately triumphs over the kids rampant lust 
hugh maguire plays goodnatured dad proprietor of a sporting 
goods store kimberly farr is supermom filled with angst at 
returning to work and leaving her baby in the hands of a stranger 
im all set she declares ive got my briefcase my wall 
street journal my breast pump david moscow is the suitably 
baffled younger brother 
robert sternin and prudence fraser created the series and wrote 
the pilot one of the better ones of the season 
heartland stars brian keith as curmudgeonly bl mccutcheon 
who lost his farm to the bankers and had to move in with his 
daughter casey kathleen layman her farmer husband tom richard 
gilliland and their three kids teenaged johnny jason kristopher 
dreams of living an urban existence in glittery la while his 
brother gus devin ratray rhapsodizes about his pet pig daisy 
keith plays their adopted vietnamese daughter but she doesnt have 
a lot to do in the pilot 
not unlike bluecollar family in roseanne they struggle 
against financial realities with humor 
the pilot relies too much on oneliners but theres something 
endearing about a comedy that even dares to occasionally mention god 
in the pilot the family has to bring in the wheat crop without 
their brokendown combine before a fierce storm blows in they do 
and it does bringing with it a tornado when they emerge from the 
basement to see if their home is standing tom declares its 
still here but theres a dead witch under the house and 
everythings in color 
bl is supposed to be a kind of archie bunker of the plains but 
hes too sweet to take seriously bl and tom carp at each other 
but beneath it all have a begrudging mutual respect theres a nice 
moment when tom tries to tell bl he appreciates the way bl stood 
up to the smarmy finance man whos trying to buy toms farm 
goodhearted heartland is produced by tony thomas paul witt 
and don reo who is also the writer

critics say the academy awards 
telecast is showing its age producer allan carr says thats the way 
it should be 
in an attempt to keep the programs ratings from slipping carr 
will celebrate oscar by reveling in its yesteryears 
im restoring it hopefully to what it was in its glorious 
day carr said of the march 29 broadcast of the 61st annual 
academy awards from the shrine auditorium in los angeles the 
program will be shown at 9 pm est by abctv 
carr and scenic designer ray clausen will recreate a likeness of 
the cocoanut grove the tropical nightclub where the oscar dinner 
banquet was held in 1940 famous movie couples will be seated at 
tables between the palm trees and a bandstand will be on the stage 
this is the ultimate variety show carr said its also the 
ultimate awards show that all the other awards show copy so i have 
to make this a return to oscar the way it was in the old days 
because now you have the tonys the grammys the american music 
awards the peoples choice awards theres an awards show on 
every other week 
the oscars are supposed to be really glamorous and fun its 
the highest awards we give our royalty in this country im going to 
shock people with glamour and humor 
carr comes from a career filled with flamboyant spectacles as 
the producer of the stage hit la cage aux folles and the movies 
grease cant stop the music and where the boys are 84 
his projects have rarely strayed from playfulness and overblown 
kitsch he even held a blacktie dinner party in 1976 at the lincoln 
heights jail in a rundown section of east los angeles to celebrate 
the opening of murder by death which starred the late author 
truman capote 
whether people like me or dont like me or they like what i do 
or dont like what i do they know that i love hollywood and im a 
big enthusiast for hollywood carr said 
for the last four years the orchestra has not been in the 
auditorium they were at an abc studio five miles away and the music 
was piped in but this is going to be a broadway show i insisted 
that the orchestra comes back marvin hamlisch will be in the pit 
conducting and ramps have been put over the orchestra pit so the 
people can run up the aisles 
i am producing really two things a live show for the people 
who are there like a broadway opening night and a television 
show which has a feeling of a broadway opening night for the people 
at home 
there will be no single program host this year don johnson and 
melanie griffith will present the first statuette cher and michael 
douglas will present the last and dozens of other stars will manage 
everything in between 
offscreen couples will be paired onscreen farrah fawcett will 
appear with ryan oneal goldie hawn will be with kurt russell and 
demi moore will be escorted by her husband bruce willis 
its like chariots of fire its like a relay race carr 
said the presenters pass the torch to the next person 
the telecast will honor awards presenters as well as winners 
when stewart and kim novak appear to hand out a trophy the audience 
will be shown a clip from their work together in 1958s vertigo 
the awards show will be held on wednesday this year unlike the 
traditional monday the move is a result of both the preceding 
easter holiday and a possible television technicians strike the 
following week the show carr said will be seen in 164 countries 
including the soviet union for the first time 
when it was announced that i was going to produce the show 
people said youve got to have more of the entrances and the 
arrivals thats what people love to see the oscars are about 
entrances and so you will see great stars through five generations 
of different age groups making the entrances down these incredible 
staircases 
one production number will focus on upandcoming stars and 
there will be a retrospective of film musicals 
i wanted to bring my love of the musical movie to the oscars 
carr said through lots of research i realized that more movie 
stars made musicals in the 50s than any other decade so i have put 
together this homage to the stars of the 50s musical and you will 
see people like betty grable gene kelly donald oconnor but 
also mario lanza elvis presley ava gardner rita hayworth and lana 
turner 
carr said complaints about past oscar shows running past their 
allotted three hours miss the real point 
you only realize how long it is if youre bored he said 
my answer is you didnt ask how long ben hur was now that 
lawrence of arabia is out again its almost four hours long no 
one complains if youre entertained you dont watch the clock 
to keep the pace brisk oscar winners with multiple trophy 
recipients as is common in technical awards will have one 
designated speaker after 30 seconds of thank yous the microphone 
will go dead and the camera will go to the next podium said carr 
they can talk as long as they want but no ones going to hear 
it

laura goldin wants to substitute five words 
in the state civil code with two words that supporters say would 
undo years of antigay discrimination and opponents say would 
undermine societys structure 
the change goldin wrote in a proposed code revision unanimously 
endorsed by the bar association of san franciscos directors would 
define marriage as a personal relation arising out of a civil 
contract between two people 
under the law now its between a man and a woman 
the change would have let larry brinkin take a threeday leave 
after the death of his lover of 11 years his employer wouldnt let 
him off though a coworker got time off for the death of a 
stepmother he had never met 
it would have made it easier for donna hitchens and her partner 
to adopt hitchens an attorney had to become the childs guardian 
leaving her partner with no legal parental authority until they 
successfully challenged the law ultimately they legally adopted 
two children 
it also would force hospitals to allow a gay aids patients lover 
into intensive care many only let in relatives 
gay couples live in a limbolike state outside of the law 
said peter keane president of the local association its a 
pariahtype class thats set up within the law to me its an 
unfairness issue 
redefining marriage to include homosexuals would grant all the 
rights privileges and burdens of marriage to gay couples among 
the areas affected if the proposal is made into law are tax 
exemptions inheritance laws pensions and health plans as well as 
parenting privileges and adoption rights 
were not for it said deacon norman d phillips spokesman 
for catholic archbishop john quinn to us marriage is a sacrament 
with deeply religious overtones our church believes marriage can 
only be entered into by a male and a female quinn believes some 
inequities may warrant compensation but calls for use of contracts 
that dont establish a quasimarriage 
the resolution must survive two local reviews to be considered by 
the state bar conference of delegates in september when about 500 
representatives of the states 117000 lawyers will consider and 
propose new laws and and plan repeal efforts if it passes bar 
lobbyists will seek a legislative sponsor 
the specification of a man and a woman became law in 1977 
after a spate of gay marriages which werent prohibited then under 
the amendment signed by gov jerry brown homosexuals have little 
say regarding partners medical care and cannot share insurance 
coverage or health benefits 
in west hollywood the first us city governed by a majority of 
gay city officials unmarried city employees may add their partners 
to health benefit and pension plans berkeley and santa cruz offer 
similar benefits 
in san francisco where an estimated 10 percent of residents are 
gay board of supervisors president harry britt the panels only 
gay member has spent years trying to provide sweeping rights to 
alternative families 
goldin who is not gay said her proposal also would include 
child custody community property and spousal support obligations 
supporters dont anticipate throngs of gay couples flocking to 
the altar but they insist that everyone should have the opportunity 
and equal rights 
auto insurance companies that offer family reductions exclude 
homosexuals and unmarried heterosexual couples and income tax laws 
favor married couples in some ways according to karen strauss of 
the lesbian rights project 
so long as benefits are given or taken away based on 
relationship status then we want access to them as well said 
cynthia goldstein an attorney with national gay rights advocates 
like many lesbians hitchens says she would marry if she could 
after 12 years with her partner and two adopted children she said 
economics not emotion would prompt her to tie the legal knot 
brinkin who lost a court battle against his employer over 
bereavement leave for the death of richard reich isnt sure whether 
he would marry my commitment comes from my heart and i dont need 
a piece of paper to do that 
advocates of the change say the issue is purely a question of 
law that the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment of the 
constitution prohibits discrimination against classes of people and 
should cover homosexuals 
my guess is that the debate is going to be much more 
sociological than legal said colin wied president of the state 
bar society would recoil at this idea my guess is that lawyers 
will follow suit

miguel braschi and leslie blanchard were 
regarded by friends as a loving couple their manhattan apartment 
the home of any happily married couple but braschi faces 
eviction because their landlord disagrees 
when blanchard died in braschis arms in 1986 blanchards name 
was on the lease to the rentcontrolled apartment the two men had 
shared for a decade 
leases pass from parent to child or spouse to spouse under the 
rent control laws in new york citys tight and pricy real estate 
market braschi says that as a family member he should have 
succession rights even though his name wasnt on the lease 
the landlord stahl associates co maintains braschi had no 
right to the desirable apartment because he was not a member of 
blanchards traditional family unit those related by blood 
marriage or adoption 
according to thomas stoddard executive director of the lambda 
legal defense fund a gay rights group the case is about 
individuals who live in families that vary from the ozzie and 
harriet mold 
state court judge harold baer ruled that the men were a family 
under the rentcontrol law because of the time love and 
commitment given by braschi to blanchard baer halted the 
eviction but was overturned on appeal the court of appeals new 
yorks highest court will hear arguments april 26 
braschi is allowed to stay in the apartment while the case is in 
court 
its not just a question for gay people stoddard said 
its an issue about the right of each individual to enter into a 
nontraditional nonorthodox relationship and be protected by the 
law 
the court of appeals must decide whether people in 
nontraditional living arrangements homosexuals unmarried 
heterosexuals even elderly couples have the same protection as 
married couples and blood relatives 
the court ruled in 1984 that one member of a homosexual couple 
couldnt adopt the other to keep from being evicted from an 
apartment that only allowed family members to live together 
this is the most important case in the country dealing with 
nontraditional family arrangements said stoddard the courts 
decision could affect insurance hospital visiting rights 
inheritance and other areas in which the definition of family is 
crucial 
blanchard had hired braschi to manage his exclusive manhattan 
beauty salon and made him sole beneficiary leaving him 5 million

was holding blanchard in his arms when he died in september 1986 
braschi 33 says he and blanchard regarded one another as 
spouses 
their friends regarded them as a married couple and their 
apartment as the home of any happily married couple according 
to court papers 
stahl associates has argued that the legislature never extended 
succession rights to members of a nontraditional family unit 
and has accused braschi of trying to turn the case into a

from 18thcentury france to the backroads of 
1960s mississippi to todays corporate manhattan the academy award 
nominees for best picture of 1988 offer a wide range of place and 
theme 
but the frontrunner seems to be rain man the saga of an 
autistic savant kidnapped by his coldhearted brother which has 
already won the directors guild award for its director barry 
levinson 
rain man had its problems before production dustin hoffman 
was intrigued with playing a retarded man gifted with a genius for 
numbers the role of the autistic mans brother a scheming 
salesman was closer to hoffmans age but the actor heeded his 
agents advice after hoffman and warren beattys ishtar 
disaster dont put two middleaged actors on the screen hearthrob 
tom cruise jumped at the chance to act with hoffman 
directors martin brest steven spielberg and sydney pollack 
undertook rain man in succession all three withdrew for various 
reasons the project soon began to look like one of those dream 
movies that never get made 
then hoffman met levinson good morning vietnam at a 
performance of the cirque de soleil in santa monica calif levinson 
directed rain man under schedule and 25 million under the 24 
million budget including an estimated 5 million apiece for the 
stars the film has grossed 1261 million 
dangerous liaisons is another film with an unsettled history 
the source material choderlos de laclos 1782 novel about sexual 
intrigue among french aristocrats long had been overlooked by a 
hollywood that disfavored costume dramas dont give me any 
pictures where they write with feathers jack warner is reported 
to have once said 
when les liaisons dangereuses became a hit play in london and 
new york lorimar telepictures bought the rights and hired the 
playwright christopher hampton to write the script the movie was 
filmed in france as lorimars fortunes were flagging also milos 
forman was shooting another version of laclos work 
after british director stephen frears had made dangerous 
liaisons the title anglicized for americans lorimar sold out to 
warner bros despite fears the movie would be ditched warners has 
given it a decent and slow release hoping for wordofmouth 
support the gross after 11 weeks 212 million 
the most controversial of the film nominees is mississippi 
burning a fictionalized account of the investigation of the 1964 
murder of three civil rights worker in neshoba county miss the 
chris gerolmo script directed by alan parker tells the story 
through the eyes of two fbi investigators played by gene hackman 
and willem dafoe 
mississippi burning was attacked by those who participated 
and reported the 1964 freedom summer said author david halberstam 
who covered the story for the new york times parker has taken a 
terribly moving and haunting story and he has betrayed it turned it 
into a martinandlewis slapstick between two cops its a bad 
movie mississippi false 
it was unfortunate that it was so narrow in scope that it did 
not show one black role model that todays youth who look at the 
movie could remember said myrlie evers whose activist husband 
medgar evers was murdered by white segregationists outside his 
mississippi home in 1963 
gerolmo not an oscar nominee replied i never understood this 
to be hollywoods civil rights picture its an exciting story 
about something important you see our moral failures and greatness 
it allows us to see america at its very worst and also to see people 
who displayed great moral courage 
mississippi burning the fbi code for the case drew mixed 
reviews several awards and only fair business 288 million in 13 
weeks 
the accidental tourist marks the third collaboration between 
actor william hurt and director lawrence kasdan they also worked 
together on body heat and the big chill in the new film 
hurt plays a travel writer who writes books for people who hate to 
travel his private life is torn between his estranged wife 
kathleen turner and an uninhibited dog trainer geena davis 
while reviews were generally excellent some criticized the 
passivity of hurts character whats wrong with the heroism of a 
man who has traveled two inches hurt replies that two inches 
is very profound 
the accidental tourist has had a fairly good response at the 
box office 288 million in 11 weeks but receipts have dropped off 
in recent weeks 
working girl gives top billing to harrison ford and sigourney 
weaver but they are virtually supporting players to thirdbilled 
melanie griffith she plays the central figure of tess mcgill a 
shrewd ambitious secretary who uses tricks worthy of the cia to 
climb to the top of the corporate ladder 
the script bounced around 20th century fox until it reached mike 
nichols who agreed to direct one of the hardest things for a 
director to find in the 80s is a good story he says 
every actress in town wanted this part says melanie 
griffith you should see the script im on every page 
because nichols insisted on the littleknown griffith you can 
see right into her feelings he said fox paid big salaries to 
ford and weaver to assure star value 
though some critics twitted working girl as a fairy tale 
most were favorable audiences agreed the gross so far 542 
million in 11 weeks

with the snow melting on peaks around the 
rogue river valley its time for a return to the oregon shakespeare 
festival where the 1989 season has opened with four plays examining 
personal conflict 
although it will be another three months before the festival 
opens its outdoor elizabethan stage the two indoor theaters are 
presenting arthur millers all my sons edmond rostands 
cyrano de bergerac cp taylors and a nightingale sang 
and januscz glowackis hunting cockroaches 
all my sons cyrano and nightingale are standout 
productions with sparkling individual efforts strong ensemble work 
and innovative sets that sustain the festivals high standards 
the most impressive must be cyrano its got tender love 
scenes and flashy swordplay lightning wit and grisly battles but 
most of all its got henry woronicz in the title role who gives a 
daring dangerous cyrano whose sensitive side reveals a 
brokenhearted poet at one instant he is the gascon warrior with 
panache in another he is a timid little boy who is ashamed of 
his overgrown nose 
marco barricelli and michelle morain give a delicious warmth to 
the roles of the lovers christian and roxanne and mark murphey 
brings the villainous count de guiche to the very brink of darkness 
without sacrificing anything in credibility 
james edmondsons direction is right on mark whether the moment 
calls for a kiss or a killing william bloodgoods set deborah 
drydens costumes and robert petersons lighting all add to the 
success of this classic 
in all my sons miller examines the need for ethics over 
greed by examining two families in crisis following the end of world 
war ii joe keller played powerfully by richard elmore owns a 
plant that turned out some defective airplane engine parts that 
eventually killed 21 american pilots 
he and his foreman both were sent to prison for passing the 
defective parts along but joe got out on appeal and has attempted 
to return to a normal life a complicating factor is that joes son 
who was reported missing in action had planned to marry his 
foremans daughter until the scandal broke 
joes remaining son chris is planning to marry the same girl 
and the flowering of their relationship has reopened wounds 
cristine mcmurdowallis plays joes emotionally scarred wife who 
refuses to accept her elder sons death michelle morain brings an 
understated style to the pivotal role of the girlfriend and mark 
murphey runs the range from utter joy to unbearable anguish as 
chris philip killian directs 
the beautiful set the backyard of the allamerican home is 
the work of william bloodgood 
world war ii is also the basis for action in and a nightingale 
sang this time the scene is newcastleontyne england where 
german bombs drop outside while the stott family deals with 
emotional bombs of their own inside 
the story centers around helen a pleasant but plain woman in her 
late 20s who has a slight limp much to her surprise she finds love 
in the arms of a soldier then she discovers he involved with 
someone else this rather mundane plot is spiced by the antics of 
helens parents grandfather and sister a strange lot to say the 
least 
through the chaos of war and an unsteady home life helen holds 
herself steady and eventually overcomes her setbacks to emerge a 
stronger person 
jeanne paulsens performance as helen is one of the jewels at 
ashland this season and the audience is clearly won over by her 
spirit but high marks are also in order for all the others in this 
talented cast w francis walters as her dittyloving communist dad 
dee maaske as the devoutly catholic mother deena burke as the ditsy 
sister sandy mccallum as her spunky grandfather bill geisslinger 
as her brotherinlaw and remi sandri as the soldier in her life 
warner shook directs this touching play which takes place in an 
english home with the wonderfully workable set designed by richard 
l hay 
the fourth offering at ashland hunting cockroaches is also 
the only one staged inside the tiny black swan theatre it centers 
on two polish immigrants as they attempt to adjust to life in 
america as represented by their cockroachinfested apartment in new 
york 
anka and janek played by robynn rodriguez and robert 
lisellfrank face problems in the new world her accent keeps her 
from finding an acting job hes a struggling playwright 
but they also face a variety of nightmarish roaches that 
crawl out from under the bed these include a bag lady a censor an 
immigration officer and polish secret police agents played in turn 
by philip davidson joann johnson and buzz fraser pat patton is the 
director 
the cast particularly rodriguez deserve praise for their 
efforts but the play never really works and tends to drag

on a recent stroll around new yorks upper west 
side bernadette peters was greeted by shouts of appreciation from 
passersby for peters a broadway star whose performance in song 
and dance earned her a tony its her part of town 
but cross over to the east side and head down about 60 blocks and 
the bright lights give way to the lofts and underground art 
galleries of soho its a world depicted in tama janowitzs 
collection of stories slaves of new york a new movie in which 
peters stars 
its also a world that the actress a native of ozone park in 
queens knew little about 
it was a unique experience doing the film peters said in a 
recent interview there were lots of areas i had never gone to 
before the burned out buildings avenue c and d with people 
living in burnedout cars i never realized how much of that there 
was 
slaves of new york was developed by the producerdirector 
team of ismail merchant and james ivory whose long list of credits 
include a room with a view and maurice 
peters stars as eleanor a copyreader at an east village 
newspaper who lives with her boyfriend stash a manipulative and 
highstrung artist dressed in layers of colorful clothing and 
designing outrageous hats eleanor seems to share the same offbeat 
outlook as her bohemian friends yet feels inferior 
she doesnt appreciate herself peters said she doesnt 
realize what shes capable of everyone else is concerned with what 
will sell but eleanor just makes hats because she enjoys it 
peters recently turned 41 but her soft features squeaky voice 
and long curly blond hair make her appear much younger she has 
been in show business since age 5 when she was a regular on 
televisions horn and hardart childrens hour 
but she was a fan as well peters recalled seeing the film 
version of auntie mame with rosalind russell reprising her star 
stage role 
my girlfriends rang the bell and i said ok and asked my mother 
if i could go i realized that when i got home how much i loved the 
movie what i love right now is that with each film im learning 
more about being in front of the camera its about making that 
moment immediate i love that 
movies were even more important to peters than the newest craze 
of the 1950s rock n roll 
i used to come from school and there was a four oclock movie 
on i grew up on them and watched them after school instead of 
american bandstand 
she was 9 years old when she joined actors equity and 13 when she 
had her first major stage role as baby june in gypsy peters 
limited her performing during high school concentrating on her 
studies and didnt have any major success until the late 1960s when 
she starred in dames at sea an offbroadway spoof of the busby 
berkeley musicals that were popular 30 years earlier 
when her theater career sagged in the early 70s she turned to 
television and film she was a regular on the carol burnett show 
and also appeared on all in the family her work on screen was 
less notable with a minor role in the longest yard a prison 
comedy starring burt reynolds and parts in a pair of forgotten 
films ace eli and rodger of the skies 
but at the same time she was putting together a solo nightclub 
act to highlight her considerable skills as an actor and singer and 
in 1974 she earned a tony nomination as the lead in mack and 
mabel a musical about silent film director mack sennett and his 
leading lady mabel normand 
in 1977 she met comedian steve martin and the two began a 
heavily publicized personal and professional relationship starring 
in the films the jerk and pennies from heaven during which 
they broke up 
pennies from heaven came out during christmas and it was 
advertised as this wonderful christmas musical peters recalled of 
the 1981 film for which she earned a golden globe award it was 
not just a happy musical 
although the movie failed at the box office peters popularity 
was just about to take off in 1984 she triumphantly returned to 
broadway receiving rave reviews for her performance as dot in 
stephen sondheims production of sunday in the park with george 
she earned a tony nomination for sunday and won the award two 
years later as the star of andrew lloyd webbers song and dance 
the actress talked about the unique experience of appearing alone in 
front of a live audience 
youre there and im here and were together she said 
were here to have an experience the audience was the other 
character really i was very lucky it felt very odd to be up there 
with nobody 
after completing a stint as the witch in the sondheimjames 
lapine collaboration into the woods she began working on 
slaves of new york for which she had plenty of fellow actors 
but no audience peters however enjoyed the experience and is 
anxious to make more movies 
you connect with the moment and the other character and 
whatevers happening im trying to surprise myself all the time i 
think youre always learning youre always surprising yourself

for much of his career in broadway musicals 
james brennan has been paid not to perform 
you could find his name in tiny type in the playbill usually 
beneath a sentence solemnly proclaiming understudies never 
substitute for listed players unless a specific announcement is made 
at the time of the performance 
from good news to so long 174th street to i love my 
wife to little me to singin in the rain to me and my 
girl brennan has stood by or covered roles terms used to 
describe that unsung hero of live performance the understudy 
now in a reaffirmation of classic broadway folklore the 
understudy has become the star brennan has taken over the leading 
role in me and my girl the longrunning british musical about a 
cockney scamp who inherits a title and money but almost loses his 
girlfriend because of his newfound wealth 
the day of my first performance here in new york my wife drove 
me by the marquee and i looked at it he says i had a double 
feeling all at once i was saying i cant believe it but i also 
thought to myself yeah it looks just like everybody elses name 
did up there 
the 38yearold brennan has been part of the me and my girl 
company since the show opened in 1986 he was the standby for its 
original star robert lindsay and then for lindsays replacement 
jim dale 
it was the best job in new york brennan says i could come 
in to work and check in at half hour before curtain time and then 
go to the theater or go to a restaurant or talk with a friend or 
read a book or do a crossword puzzle and i did all that 
during lindsays ninemonth run brennan never went on for the 
star but he played the role for about six weeks during dales 
20month engagement replacing a big name can be unnerving for a 
performer who must face the wrath of disappointed theatergoers 
expecting to see someone else 
there is a good understudy mentality and a bad understudy 
mentality brennan says you have to disregard the groans and 
the displeasure that the audience exhibits at the beginning of the 
evening and hold onto what you know the curtain call will be at the 
end of the evening 
i remember going through a time when i thought how can i live 
up to what the audience expects he adds but you get over 
that its not your job to worry 
brennan originally took the job with me and my girl because 
he had heard the lead role was terrific 
i also heard that bob lindsay was magic he adds i thought 
i could learn something from him which in fact was the case 
last fall brennan replaced tim curry in the national touring 
company of the show playing three months around the country before 
coming back to the starring role in new york 
because we have good producers they tried to find someone with 
a boxoffice name he says they didnt find anybody who fit all 
the requirements of the role and still had boxoffice impact 
so brennan was chosen for the demanding part now he has thrown 
himself into a regimen a lot of rest and a lot of food so hell 
have enough strength to get through the marathon workout but its 
something he has worked for all his professional career 
born and raised in newark nj he remembers discovering theater 
programs an aunt had brought back across the hudson river from 
manhattan and he recalls lobbying to see either the music man 
or gypsy he didnt get to either one but the theater bug had 
bit 
in high school brennan appeared in a musical every year the 
director robert hayes also ran a summer theater in beach haven on 
the jersey shore 
he asked me if i wanted to be an apprentice there after my 
sophomore year of high school brennan recalls in newark 
theres not a lot to do in the summer so i did i was there five 
years all summer 
brennan majored in theater at rutgers university and after 
graduating went out on the road with a long national tour of no 
no nanette starring june allyson and later virginia mayo 
the director was donald saddler who later cast brennan in the 
chorus of a revival of the 1927 college musical good news since 
then he has never stopped working in the theater his stints have 
included roles in a revue rodgers and hart and in 42nd 
street two shows where he didnt have to understudy anyone 
brennan also has been back to beach haven to direct for hayes and 
has worked for the new amsterdam theater company directing and 
choreographing such old musicals as cole porters jubilee and 
jerome kerns sally 
i find that everything is sort of a chain in show business 
brennan says and ive been very lucky

new york stories 
 
it began as an excellent idea take three top american 
filmmakers set them out on the streets of new york and loop their 
efforts into one fulllength feature to celebrate those collective 
talents and the city they supposedly enshrined 
unfortunately the idea doesnt quite gel with new york 
stories 
the touchstone pictures release consists of three vignettes by 
martin scorsese francis coppola and woody allen but only 
scorseses life lessons is worth the cost of todays pricey 
movie tickets its also the first story in the production so one 
can easily slip out at its conclusion and skip the next two 
life lessons also is the only vignette that truly mirrors the 
spirit and attitude of new york in this case the downtown art 
world it has a feel texture and mood thanks in part to the gritty 
and witty original screenplay by bronxborn writer richard price 
and the sensitive and probing lens of the celebrated cinematographer 
nestor almendros it is a tight short story a film exposition that 
develops as brilliantly and explosively as the giant canvases 
almendros so wonderfully captures with his camera 
coppolas life without zoe by contrast is a shallow effort 
centered around the sherry netherland hotel the privileged few and 
the superficialities of eurotrash it has nothing really to do with 
new york and in fact concludes in greece 
allens oedipus wrecks justifies itself as a new york story 
with a cameo by mayor edward i koch and a throwaway line about how 
new yorkers take certain bizarre happenings in their stride 
nick nolte gives a memorable performance in life lessons as 
lionel the lion dolby a brash uncompromising paternalistic 
artist whose brutal expansive paintings match his passion and 
daring he plays father to young women taking them in as his art 
assistants and repaying them with life lessons ahem 
his latest paulette rosanna arquette fancies herself an 
artist but has become smothered by lionel shes decided to leave 
him but he lures her back with no strings attached they resolve 
their relationship in a predictable way but its fun to watch 
arquette gives the same pouty whiney adenoidal performance 
shes given in such movies as the big blue shes difficult to 
listen to let alone watch and shes dwarfed by noltes lionel 
what a joy he is from the opening shots of a paintsplattered 
cognac bottle palette cassette player and the artist himself 
staring at a blank canvas while procul harums a whiter shade of 
pale blasts through the studio to his actual execution of the 
canvas one feels his brush strokes which surely no one lower than 
god is directing 
life without zoe offers little inspiration which is 
regrettable given the vision and talent coppola has displayed in 
other works apocalpyse now the godfather tucker 
the story concerns 12yearold zoe heather mccomb who lives 
alone at the sherry cared for by the hotels male staff she is 
spoiled precocious and chatty her father giancarlo giannini is a 
world famous flute player and stays on the road her mother talia 
shire is an emotionally frayed photographer with an adolescent 
sensibility she too would rather be on the road than home these 
people dont seem to like each other or their daughter very much 
but its difficult to like any of them coppolas characters are 
not real one does not care about the distraught mother or the 
abandoned child and the father comes across as a smarmy gigolo 
there is a happy ending with a united family but life would 
indeed be better without zoe 
the best thing about allens oedipus wrecks is the title 
after that its all down hill the movie is only for those diehard 
woody allen fans who get their jollies with endless jokes about the 
muchmaligned jewish mother and who think that sitting with an 
analyst is a hip thing to do 
allen plays a 50yearold nebish who wants to marry the 
unobtainable wasp mia farrow but moms not too keen on this 
arrangement borrowing from his purple rose of cairo allen 
employs an outlandish and bizarre trick that virtually leaves mom in 
the sky 
mae questal is wonderful as the mother and julie kavner the 
brenda morgenstern of tvs rhoda is more jewish than jewish as 
the nice jewish girl who gets the nice jewish boy with a little help 
from tarot witch doctors voodoo and tea leaves 
the jack rollins and charles h joffe production was produced by 
robert greenhut and is rated pg

soldier and adventurer who lived in the 18th century he also was a 
master prevaricator whose tales would shrivel paul bunyans to 
munchkin size 
terry gilliam a founding member of the irreverent monty python 
troupe has taken this legendary liar and made the adventures of 
baron munchausen the third in his fantasy triology that includes 
time bandits and brazil 
where time bandits primarily had a comedic appeal to 
youngsters and brazil tapped more philosophical and political 
chords baron munchausen is a priceless romp with more visual 
effects and excursions into pure fantasy than any movie in memory 
theres even an unbilled cameo by robin williams as the king of the 
moon 
the story opens in late 18th century the age of reason 
wednesday with an attack on an ancient city by the ferocious 
forces of the ottoman empire a play about baron munchausen is 
underway at a local theater but the real baron is in the audience 
and takes issue with the mockery on stage 
the movie soon becomes the barons story and the spectacle is 
nonstop a hotair trip in a balloon made of ladies knickers that 
takes the baron john neville and sally salt sarah polley a 
little girl who believes in imagination to the moon and heaven 
heads that separate from bodies a venus rising from a halfshell 
complete with little angels with little wings sea monsters strange 
trees creatures seas 
but theres so much more in gilliams odyssey the film is a 
wondrous and brilliant work whose underpinnings tap the very essence 
of imagination and conformity the rigid bureaucrat horatio jackson 
jonathan pryce questions the place of fancy imagination and 
dreamers in the age of reason there isnt one he says 
fairy tales however never die 
charles mckeown who also has the dual role of rupert and 
adolphus wrote the masterful screenplay with gilliam eric idle

the copyright office urged congress to consider 
protecting future films from colorization but said it would 
probably be unconstitutional to extend such protection to existing 
movies 
the office said wednesday it would prefer legislation that would 
also protect visual artists such as sculptors and painters by 
giving them moral rights to bar unauthorized alteration of their 
works 
but it said it could support legislation applying to film makers 
alone

crude oil futures prices surged to a nearly 
17month high fueled by a report showing a drop in inventories and 
ongoing signals that opec is continuing to cut production 
on the new york mercantile exchange the april contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark grade of crude oil rose 48 cents 
wednesday to close at 1977 a barrel the last time the nearmonth 
contract was higher was on oct 30 1987 when the contract closed 
at 1996 a barrel 
on monday the april contract broke through the 19 mark for the 
first time since jan 19 closing at 1903 on tuesday the 
contract rose to 1929 
other contract months also recorded healthy gains wednesday 
refined oil products also soared the april contract for unleaded 
gasoline jumped 230 cents settling at a 19month high of 5580 
cents a gallon the nearmonth contract last closed higher on aug 
4 1987 at 5592 cents 
heating oil scheduled for april delivery rose 179 cents to close 
at 5419 cents a gallon 
contracts scheduled for delivery later in the year also advanced 
sharply 
analysts said weekly statistics from the american petroleum 
institute proved positive for the market the report released after 
the close of trading tuesday showed crude oil stocks fell 23 
million barrels last week gasoline dropped 47 million barrels and 
distillates including heating oil were down 59 million barrels 
the drop in inventories reflected a sharp increase in demand 
said andrew lebow senior broker and analyst with edampf man 
international futures inc over the last four weeks demand for oil 
products has jumped 9 percent lebow said 
i dont know why he said its contraseasonal in the case 
of heating oil and very bullish for the market 
traders said the strong demand for gasoline is due in part to 
concern about the availability of gasoline during the summer months 
when retail sales increase analysts have said us refining 
capacity is particularly tight this year and an extra burden is 
being placed on some refiners as several eastern states introduce 
new higher octane regulations 
people thought we would see a buildup in stocks before easter 
or at least see them hold steady lebow said i think right now 
the supplies are adequate but this new report brings into question 
whether well have enough 
prices also got a lift wednesday from an unconfirmed report that 
saudi arabia the largest producer among the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries was cutting production to us and 
european customers traders said 
despite the reports the markets underlying fundamentals were 
strong to start with said bob baker an analyst with 
prudentialbache securities inc 
theres an overall good indication of a healthy economy and 
theres a good demand for crude because opec oil producers seem to 
be serious about their price target 
the 13 opec countries recently agreed to cut production in an 
effort to raise oil prices the agreement took effect jan 1 and 
extends for six months

an arbitrators ruling that union workers 
who staged sympathy strikes should get their jobs back from john 
morrell amp co was thrown out by a federal judge 
company officials called the judges ruling wednesday a major 
victory and said it frees morrell from any back pay obligation 
the union promised to appeal at the time the arbitrator made his 
ruling a union leader said the back pay to the 2400 workers who 
went on strike could amount to 40 million 
in a 14page decision us district judge richard battey ruled 
that arbitrator william rentfro a university of colorado law 
professor overstepped his authority when he decided in november 
that a sixmonth sympathy strike at morrells flagship plant in 
sioux falls in 1987 was legal 
battey ruled that morrell does not have to follow rentfros 
decision and rehire workers who were replaced during the sympathy 
strike 
we will immediately move to the 8th us circuit court of 
appeals and hopefully get the proper decision said jim lyons 
president of united food and commercial workers local 304a in sioux 
falls 
a year ago a jury in batteys federal courtroom in rapid city 
decided the 1987 sympathy strike and two oneday walkouts in 1986 
were illegal on nov 10 1988 another jury awarded the company 
246 million in damages 
battey said the issue of whether the jury decisions in both the 
liability and damage phases of the case are sound is a matter for 
the appeals court 
in order to let the arbitrators award stand battey said he 
would have to find that the company agreed to let rentfro rule on 
the legality of the sympathy strike on the contract language alone 
the suggestion that morrell agreed to submit the legality of 
the sympathy strike to arbitration after having secured a successful 
jury verdict flies in the face of common sense the judge said 
last month morrell imposed a new contract on workers at the sioux 
falls plant cutting the wages of 2000 employees by up to 18 
percent more than half the workers at the plant are replacements 
hired during the 1987 sympathy strike

exports and imports both fell in january as the trade deficit 
declined to 949 billion according to a government report that 
economists said may be good news for inflation 
the decline in imports and exports could mean the rapid economic 
expansion is cooling slightly removing some pressure on production 
costs and prices economists said wednesday after the release of the 
commerce department report 
the nations merchandise trade gap fell 137 percent in january 
from a revised 1099 billion in december the department said a 
big decline in consumer imports offset a higher oil bill 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks gained 1429 points 
on wednesday to reach 232054 the dollar also was buoyed by the 
numbers while the bond market where pessimism is entrenched ended 
the day roughly neutral after an early rally 
the markets overall favorable reaction showed how investors have 
been more worried lately about inflation than about the trade 
deficit 
ordinarily a decline in exports would be considered bad news 
because it delays shrinkage in the trade gap but the 43 percent 
drop in exports in january was seen as favorable because it meant 
there was less pressure on the nations factories to churn out goods 
for shipment abroad 
a 69 percent drop in imports was also seen as good news because 
it meant declining demand for goods and services 
strong consumer demand and a strain on factory capacity have 
combined to increase inflation the federal reserve has responded by 
pushing up interest rates which has hurt stock and bond prices 
slackening growth could allow the fed to ease off on interest rates 
still other reports wednesday showed that the economys aging 
expansion continues to have plenty of strength 
the commerce department said business inventories rose 07 
percent in january while sales rose 1 percent 
a report based on surveys by the federal reserves 12 district 
banks said the economys growth is putting upward pressure on 
production costs and prices 
consumer spending except for autos has apparently gained 
momentum while manufacturing especially for export continues to 
show strength almost everywhere according to the report known as 
the tan book

hotel developer patrick kennedy and 
metropolitan life insurance co have settled a 7 billion fraud 
conspiracy lawsuit less than two months before their case was to go 
to court officials said 
kennedy owner of la mansion hotels in san antonio and austin 
charged in a january 1988 lawsuit the insurance company which 
financed construction of one of kennedys three hotels conspired to 
acquire the hotels and replace the management with that of its own 
subsidiary doubletree hotels 
as part of the agreement announced wednesday the 295room la 
mansion del norte in san antonio which had been at the crux of the 
lawsuit will be passed over to metropolitan after an uncontested 
foreclosure scheduled for april 4 
in return kennedy will receive financing from metropolitan so he 
can repurchase la mansion del rio a 340room hotel on the river 
walk that opened in 1968 but which kennedy had to sell in 1986 
because of financing problems 
no financial terms of the deal were announced 
the parties were scheduled to go to state district court on may 1 
i am just absolutely unequivocally overjoyed to be back in 
absolute ownership of la mansion del rio its meant a great deal to 
me since i built it in 1968 and its meant a lot to san antonio in 
the citys growth in the past 20 years kennedy said 
he said because of an agreement signed with metropolitan 
officials late tuesday he was unable to deviate much from a 
prepared joint statement 
metropolitan spokeswoman dorothy kelly also said she could not 
elaborate beyond the statement 
la mansion del norte hotel had been the subject of the battle 
between kennedy and metropolitan which had financed about 11 
million for construction on the hotel 
kennedy claimed in the lawsuit that between 1981 and 1984 
metropolitan began thinking of taking over la mansion del norte 
after the insurance giant acquired 20 percent of doubletree hotels 
metropolitan planned to foreclose on the hotel after kennedy said 
he couldnt make payments on it but a restraining order pending the 
outcome of the lawsuit prohibited metropolitan from pursuing the 
foreclosure 
la mansion hotel in austin a 350room hotel which opened in 
1984 was foreclosed on in 1987 by american general insurance co a 
servicing agent of metropolitan kennedy was the hotel manager and 
he was replaced by doubletree 
kennedy said last year that because of the slump in the texas 
economy he had approached metropolitan about refinancing his loan 
for la mansion del norte but metropolitan officials declined and 
sought foreclosure 
kennedy declined to elaborate on his financing structure for his 
planned expansion which would include managing the hotels 
initially before deciding on ownership or construction of new 
structures

alaska oil production fell for the third straight 
month in february and overall us crude production continued to 
decline sharply an industry trade group said 
imports also rose last month compared with the same time last 
year but consumption remained flat the american petroleum institute 
said in its monthly report wednesday 
alaska production which had offset declines in other parts of 
the united states in recent years fell by 100000 barrels a day in 
february while other us production dropped by 300000 barrels a 
day a total decline of about 5 percent api said 
the yeartoyear declines in production indicate a continuation 
of decreases in lower 48 production as well as a flattening if not 
a reversal of an upward trend in alaskan production seen during the 
last several years the trade group said 
imports in february totaled 79 million barrels compared with 
69 million barrels at the same time last year but receded from 
januarys high of 82 million the group reported 
api which represents major oil producers and refiners said the 
january import surge reflected an effort by us oil companies to 
take advantage of cheap and plentiful world oil before opec began 
cutting back its output early this year 
imports now constitute over 40 percent of the oil consumed by 
americans a level that has raised concern about national security 
as the united states becomes more dependent on foreigners for 
petroleum needs 
the continued decline in domestic production and rise in 
consumption together imply underlying growth in imports of more than 
10 percent per year the trade group said 
contributing to the rise in overall imports last month was a 
strong increase in oil products such as heating oil and gasoline 
for the first two months of 1989 product imports were up 20 percent 
over the same time last year also us refinery capacity has 
shrunk in recent years and refineries are currently operating at 
more than 80 percent capacity 
gasoline deliveries meanwhile fell 15 percent from last 
february due partly to a normal seasonal slowdown the institute 
report said 
heating oil deliveries growth also dropped to 32 percent despite 
colderthannormal february weather api said 
despite the growing imports and slowdown in gasoline demand 
total inventories fell by 8 million barrels in february down 
slightly from january and from the same time last year the report 
said

wily financier carl icahn the majority owner and 
chairman of trans world airlines inc remains the leading potential 
buyer of striketorn eastern airlines according to labor and 
financial sources close to the situation 
icahn expressed interest in buying eastern last october and the 
eastern machinists who struck the airline march 4 indicated last 
week they want him to explore a possible buyout by acquiring 
miamibased eastern icahn could use the airlines northsouth 
routes as possible feeders into twas transatlantic network 
the sale of eastern is gathering momentum as an option for parent 
texas air corp as the crippling strike against the carrier 
continues with no sign of resolution said the sources who asked 
not to be identified 
lorenzo has asked his investment bankers at drexel burnham 
lambert inc to gauge potential interest in buying eastern among 
investors and other airlines the sources said 
drexel declined to confirm that it had been approached by lorenzo 
or make any comment on the issue said steve anreder a spokesman 
for the wall street firm 
on wednesday the 12th day of the strike eastern still was 
operating only a fraction of its normal flights furthermore most 
of easterns pilots have continued honoring the strike despite 
appeals and warnings from management making it virtually impossible 
for the airline to expand service 
eastern sought federal bankruptcy court protection from creditors 
last thursday but analysts and other observers suggested that texas 
air chairman frank lorenzo would have difficulty rebuilding eastern 
through chapter 11 and may be reaching a point where he is obliged 
to sell the ailing carrier to stem his losses 
icahn continues to lead the list of potential buyers followed by 
grandview a group of investors and former corporate executives the 
sources said the grandview groups strongest suit is said to be 
management expertise giving it the belief that it could negotiate 
contracts with easterns unions that lorenzo was unable to get 
icahn and representatives of grandview did not return phone calls 
wednesday seeking comment 
last october icahn talked with lorenzo about acquiring eastern 
the move came shortly after real estate developer donald trump 
confirmed he was negotiating with texas air about a possible 
purchase of easterns air shuttle operation 
the planned shuttle sale valued at 365 million is awaiting the 
approval of the bankruptcy judge 
icahn and lorenzo dueled over control of twa over three years 
ago a lot has changed since then for both the men and the 
deregulated airline business lorenzo whose texas air empire went 
on to acquire eastern for 676 million after his twa bid failed may 
have decided that running a debtburdened and fractious airline is 
too much trouble 
eastern has been fraught with labor agitation and staggering 
financial losses before and since lorenzo took over 
for icahn who has chased giant companies ranging from usx corp 
to texaco inc in recent years the acquisition of eastern would 
make twa the largest us airline in terms of revenue passenger 
miles an industry measurement of capacity 
some major airlines also have been rumored to be looking at 
eastern but the reports have been denied by spokesmen for the 
carriers 
the value of eastern to potential buyers are its assets planes 
airport gates lucrative new yorkflorida routes which they 
believe they could deploy more effectively than lorenzo has and 
thus turn the airline around

a fraud probe into the chicago futures 
exchanges coincides with a congressional review of the commodity 
futures trading commission and has raised new questions about its 
ability to police abuses 
theoretically congress could decide not to reauthorize the 
15yearold regulatory body but cftc officials say accusations that 
they have failed to curb corruption in the freewheeling futures pits 
arent true 
weve had these same kinds of criticisms from the start said 
john v rainbolt a washington lawyer for commodities traders and 
brokers and a cftc vice chairman 
everybodys got a vested interest in doing or saying whatever 
they need to promote their particular cause he said in a recent 
interview its a combination of bureaucratic sour grapes 
regulatory competition and power plays in congress 
the cftc was created in 1974 to enforce federal laws regulating 
the futures and options markets congress reauthorized it in 1978 
1982 and 1986 lawmakers are considering legislation this year to 
extend its authority through 1994 
the house agriculture committee which oversees the commission 
planned on a quick reauthorization process 
however its chairman rep eligio kika de la garza dtexas 
ordered an indepth review after learning of an fbi investigation of 
alleged fraud and illegal trading on chicago futures markets the 
nations largest 
the fbi probe reportedly involves allegations that brokers and 
traders cheated customers out of millions of dollars in deals on the 
chicago mercantile exchange and chicago board of trade 
an immediate question that surfaced in the probe was why the cftc 
didnt root out such corruption if it existed 
futures trading had been regulated since 1936 by the commodity 
exchange authority but rainbolt said the agency with 161 
employees in the basement of the department of agriculture and no 
real authority at all was unable to keep pace with growth in the 
industry 
from 1969 to 1973 volume in regulated commodities doubled and 
trading in unregulated commodities quadrupled to create what a 
congressional report said was a 400 billion industry 
with growth came the potential for abuses such as the sale of 
unregulated options by a california company that parlayed a 1000 
investment into a multimilliondollar company by using new 
investors money to pay old customers 
the firms collapse in the early 1970s resulting in more than 
71 million in customer losses was cited as the catalyst for 
congressional action to scrap the exchange authority and create the 
cftc 
in a report on its activities in 1988 cftc chairman wendy l 
gramm said the commission assessed more than 2 million in civil 
penalties for violating commodities laws last year decided more 
than 500 reparation cases and issued more than 185 opinions and 
orders 
nonetheless critics have branded the commission as lax and 
excessively reliant on industry selfregulation 
the exchanges have their own operating rules established in 
alliance with the industryoperated national futures association 
it in turn acts with approval of the federal commission 
this whole system was born when the emphasis was to 
deregulate said rep glenn english dokla chairman of the 
subcommittee investigating the cftc the issue as we look at the 
whole system is to reassess the entire deregulation mentality is 
it adequate does it need to be changed 
futures industry officials contend selfregulation works well 
some say the cftc is too meddlesome now 
speaking as one of the regulated i get mad at the cftc and 
disagree with them every day said john m damgard president of 
the futures industry association trade group and a commodity 
purchaser himself 
but the relationship is not so adversarial that were unwilling 
to admit we have somebody over there whos smart who understands 
our industry and who will listen damgard said that is an 
agency that over the last 15 years has matured into one of the 
finest government agencies we have 
even if lawmakers reauthorize the cftc some predict the debate 
will resurrect jursidictional arguments over who should regulate 
futures trading the cftc or the rival securities and exchange 
commission 
the sec has been a better regulator said rep jim cooper 
dtenn you need a strong regulatory body regardless of what its 
initials are to police a group of very impressive and sometimes 
greedy traders and brokers

berkshire hathaway inc which is headed by 
investor warren buffett has accumulated since last summer a 63 
percent stake in cocacola co that is now valued at about 115 
billion coke has disclosed 
cocacola officials said they viewed the purchases as a strong 
vote of confidence from the widelyrespected investor who with 
his wife controls 45 percent of the omaha nebbased berkshire 
hathaways stock 
in a telephone interview wednesday buffett described the stock 
purchase as simply a passive investment and said he is happy 
with the way the company is being managed berkshire hathaway is a 
diversified holding company 
buffett has a reputation for taking sizeable stakes in a limited 
number of companies and hold them for a long time 
the disclosure sent cocacola stock up 125 a share to 5150 in 
active trading of about 11 million shares on the new york stock 
exchange 
cocacola chairman roberto c goizueta disclosed the berkshire 
holding in a memo to the soft drink makers employees late tuesday 
he said berkshire had accumulated 63 percent of cocacolas 
common stock over the last several months 
atlantabased cocacola has about 364 million shares outstanding 
buffett said the stake amounted to about 22 million shares 
accumulated by various insurance subsidiaries of berkshire hathaway 
over the past eight or nine months 
in his memo to the employees goizueta said the investment is 
in keeping with berkshire hathaways track record of making 
longterm investments in companies with a strong consumer franchise 
and a focused business 
he called it a strong vote of confidence and a welcomed 
endorsement of our past success and future potential 
he also noted that buffett was one of the biggest fans of 
cherry coke and declared it the official soft drink of berkshire 
hathaway at that companys 1986 annual meeting 
buffett acknowledged that he favors the drink and said he has 
been very impressed by the international strength of the cocacola 
brand and the job that management has done 
he said his company had not previously disclosed the stake 
because insurance companies are not required to do so until their 
holding reaches 10 percent or stands at 5 percent at the end of a 
year federal rules require other shareholders to disclose a holding 
in a company when it reaches 5 percent 
cocacola is the worlds largest soft drink maker it earned 
104 billion or 285 a share on revenue of 834 billion in 1988 
berkshire hathaway inc which has about 114 million common 
shares outstanding has a stock value of about 547 billion based 
on its closing price of 4800 a share wednesday on the nyse 
buffett known as much for his folksy wisdom and unpretentious 
lifestyle as his financial acumen has combined a patient 
valueoriented stock strategy with a knack for finding investment

forbes magazine estimates his personal wealth at about 14 
billion 
buffett acquired berkshire hathaway a massachusetts 
clothmilling concern with 10 million in assets in the mid1960s 
since then he has turned it into a diversified holding company with 
about 2 billion in assets

a streamlined hospital corporation of 
america will be just the right size chairman thomas frist jr says 
shareholders voted wednesday to sell hca the nations largest 
hospital management company to a managementled group headed by 
frist in a 5 billion leveraged buyout 
one of the first orders of business is selling off three 
subsidiaries to repay a 13 billion shortterm loan that will help 
finance the buyout and clear the way for hcas managers to run the 
hospitals in the united states frist said 
hca owns 79 general hospitals and 52 psychiatric hospitals in 
this country and an additional 25 around the world it manages 191 
more us hospitals and two in other countries according to the 
companys 1988 annual report 
its very streamlined today and im involved in the daytoday 
operations frist said during a news conference after the 
shareholders meeting 
he said the new company tf investments which became 
hcahospital corporation of america on wednesday has no plans to 
sell its general hospitals 
if youd ask me what itd look like one year from today we 
have approximately 80 today id be quite surprised if we didnt 
have 80 then maybe add one and sell one he said 
frist said managing 70 to 80 hospitals is ideal 
basically were more focused he said 
frist said he wants to sell the three subsidiaries hca 
psychiatric co hca management co and hca international as 
intact units rather than breaking apart their assets 
the idea is that we can now hopefully create three other 
companies that will stand on their own he said 
the new company is paying 51 a share for the more than 71 
million outstanding shares of hca stock making the total purchase 
price 36 billion including debt the deal amounts to more than 5 
billion hca spokesman victor campbell said 
in a leveraged buyout the assets of the company are used as 
collateral to borrow the money needed to purchase the company such 
a transaction usually increases a companys debt substantially 
taking the company private does permit us to be more longterm 
oriented not quartertoquarter frist said 
we can run things differently theres no plans for layoffs or 
to squeeze this company down it was the right thing to do at 
this time in our history

said in the march issue of agricultural outlook magazine 
farm fuel prices rose slightly in 1988 the report said as 
a result of higher crude oil prices in the last quarter of 1988 
average petroleum product prices paid by farmers should rise 
throughout 1989 
the report said the increase in crude oil prices during last 
years fourth quarter was prompted by an agreement of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries to hold down 
production 
under opecs agreement in november there would be a price target 
of 18 per barrel and a reduction in output from the 17year high of 
225 million barrels per day to 185 million per day in the first 
six months of 1989 
the agreement also brought iraq back into the cartel with a quota 
equivalent to that of iran the report said 
according to department of energy forecasts economic growth of 
about 25 percent will offset higher crude oil prices and us 
petroleum consumption will therefore inch up about 1 percent this 
year 
the report said that for the first time since 1980 domestic 
petroleum demand last year averaged more than 17 million barrels a 
day refiners paid an average of 14 per barrel in the last half of 
1988 down 25 percent from 1987 prices 
but prices surged near the end of 1988 and west texas 
intermediate crude reached 18 per barrel in january 1989 the 
report said crude oil prices are expected to range from 15 to 
20 per barrel in 1989 
meanwhile us domestic production will probably slacken again 
this year to about 8 million barrels a day down 200000 from last 
year and 1988 output of 82 million barrels a day was the lowest in 
24 years 
expanding demand and decreasing domestic production are 
expected to boost us net imports in 1989 to 68 million barrels 
per day or 39 percent of domestic consumption the report said 
this rate may be compared with a record high import of 86 million 
barrels per day in 1977 and a low of 43 million in 1985 
the energy supply and price outlook for us agriculture mostly 
reflects world market conditions currently characterized by 
abundant oil supplies and higher prices 
in 1989 farmers can expect plentiful supplies of diesel fuel 
gasoline and lp liquefied petroleum gas but at slightly higher 
prices than last year the report said 
yet the combined use of gasoline and diesel fuel by farmers has 
declined in recent years because of improved farm production 
technology shifts from gasoline to more efficient diesel units and 
greatly reduced crop plantings 
although acres planted greatly influences the fluctuations in 
farm energy use other factors also have contributed to the 
decline the report said continued replacement of older 
gasoline machines with dieselpowered machines particularly in the 
production of cotton rice and some minor crops has resulted in 
greater use of diesel fuel 
besides acreage cutbacks under some government crop programs 
last years droughtreduced yields also contributed to an estimated 
5 percent reduction in farm fuel use in 1988 the report said lower 
grain moisture levels at harvest also reduced energy requirements 
but expenditures for farm energy gasoline diesel fuel lp and 
electricity were about 7 billion last year up 3 percent from 
1977 because of higher prices and greater reliance on electricity 
in 1989 energy expenditures which comprise about 55 percent 
of total farm production expenses are projected to jump 7 percent 
to 75 billion largely due to an expected 4 percent to 11 percent 
increase in planted area of the eight major crops the report said 
this will offset longterm reductions in fuel use related to 
conservation primarily from 28 million acres of land taken from 
production under the conservation reserve program

officials who cleared the suzuki samurai of 
allegations that it tends to roll over say that study has prompted 
an investigation of the ford bronco ii which showed a far worse 
record of fatal rollovers 
in the process of studying rollovers we began to get curious 
about the bronco said national traffic safety board spokesman tim 
hurd he said the inquiry covering all 198489 broncos will try to 
determine if the vehicle the types of drivers who use it or the 
environment in which it is driven contributed to the fatal accidents 
ford motor co said it believes the record of its 590000 bronco 
iis is not significantly different from that of other sport utility 
vehicles 
the bronco ii is a welldesigned safe utility vehicle and 
ford believes that the accident statistics do not reflect any 
safetyrelated defect the company said in a statement from 
detroit it added that accidents in all such vehicles are strongly 
influenced by adverse driver or environmental factors 
ford spokeswoman barbara mansfield in washington said the company 
has done extensive testing on the bronco ii to verify it has 
reasonable and appropriate handling and stability 
characteristics 
according to a fatal accident reporting system study included in 
last years report on the samurai 43 bronco ii singlevehicle 
rollovers resulted in fatalities in 1987 or 19 for every 100000 
vehicles on the road there were eight fatal samurai rollovers or 
six per 100000 vehicles 13 involving the chevrolet s10 blazer or 
gmc jimmy also six per 100000 and six fatal jeep cherokee 
rollovers for 25 per 100000 
the study gives no breakdown of which rollovers occurred in 
offroad conditions or other details about the accidents 
the traffic safety administration will conduct an engineering 
analysis of the bronco ii which is the second of three levels of 
investigation 
in the samurai investigation which was completed last aug 25 
the agency concluded that critics of the vehicle failed to 
demonstrate that it has an excessive tendency to roll over the 
agencys office of defects investigation denied a recall petition 
filed by the center for auto safety a public interest group often 
at odds with the industry and its regulators 
consumer reports magazine in a july 1988 issue called for a ban 
of the samurai saying it literally trips over its own feet the 
magazines publisher consumer union also petitioned for standards 
covering all vehicles to prevent rollovers 
safety administration spokesman hurd said that although the 
decision to conduct an engineering analysis of the bronco ii was 
formally based on complaints to the safety administration it also 
is the result of the statistics that turned up in the samurai 
investigation 
in the samurai inquiry the agency described rollovers as 
complicated dynamic events and acknowledged that their causes 
are not entirely understood by automotive experts 
it cited factors such as inexperienced drivers lack of seat belt 
use alcohol use driver error and poor weather as contributing to 
most of the samurai rollover deaths

internal revenue service employees in some 
parts of the country are giving correct answers to telephoned tax 
questions barely half the time the irs says 
nationwide say auditors for the general accounting office the 
irs is correct only 60 percent of the time not the 69 percent 
claimed by the irs less than a week ago some of the answers that 
irs considers correct could lead taxpayers to foul up their returns 
gao said 
robert lebaube irs director of taxpayer services quarreled with 
the gao estimate but only slightly as far as the irs is 
concerned whether we are answering 30 percent of the questions 
wrong or 40 percent of the questions wrong either number is 
absolutely unacceptable he told the house government operations 
consumer subcommittee wednesday 
the irs own tests of its telephoneassistance system indicate a 
performance no better than last years even though employees have 
had an extra year to acquaint themselves with the big 1986 tax 
overhaul while the irs figures it is correct 69 percent of the time 
nationally in some of the 29 calling sites the accuracy rate is in 
the 50s and in others it is in the 70s lebaube said 
he did not identify those areas 
in an effort to improve performance lebaube said the irs is 
switching to a more permanent work force hiring fewer people to 
work only during the filing season the agency also is assigning 
more supervisors and using new procedures to discover problem areas 
of tax law that are causing most problems for the telephone 
assistors 
lebaube advised taxpayers who call the irs tollfree numbers to 
write down their question the date and name of the person who 
provided the answer if an answer leads to an incorrect tax return 
and the taxpayer produces such a record lebaube said the irs will 
waive any penalty 
the assistors are not properly trained to answer questions 
right 100 percent of the time asked rep matthew martinez 
dcalif that to me is really an intolerable situation 
the irs blames a complicated tax law for part of the problem as 
well as the frequency of changes in the law gao has said some irs 
employees are reluctant to probe for additional information from 
taxpayers before answering their tax questions 
the irs has about 5000 employees answering telephoned tax 
questions during this filing season about 1500 of them are 
temporaries all are required to have at least a high school 
education and receive at least five weeks tax training 
gao complaints that the irs was overstating its accuracy rate 
prompted chairman doug barnard jr dga to call his subcommittee 
into session for a rare public airing of a dispute between two 
government agencies 
gao and irs agreed to work together on one test of the 
telephoneassistance system and hammered out 62 questions that irs 
officials are expected to ask clandestinely about 15000 times this 
filing season 
gao and irs agreed to score answers in only three ways correct 
correct and complete or incorrect after the tests got under way 
the irs wanted a fourth grade an answer that while not technically 
correct likely would not result in a faulty return 
gao refused to go along contending some of those answers from 
irs employees were potentially misleading irs insisted and on its 
own beganscoring those answers which were 88 percent of the total 
as correct 
thus gao came up with an accuracy rate of 604 percent irs 
added the 88 percent in the fourth category and reached a total 
accuracy rate of 698 percent 
changing the method of judging the system in the middle of the 
test raises questions about the validity of its the irss 
reported results and whether it is making progress toward improving 
the accuracy of its responses said jennie stathis of gao 
it was not our intent to mislead anyone lebaube told the 
subcommittee in retrospect and in fairness to gao we probably 
should have announced both numbers

the great lakes region needs 9 million to buy 
the only known chemical to kill the sea lamprey and develop other 
means of controlling the parasitic eel or risk devastation of the 
salmon and trout population a new york congressman says 
rep frank horton rny said wednesday that without the 
expenditure the lamprey population could double by the year 2000 
if the lampreys double this will cause the salmon and trout 
populations to be cut in half costing sport and commercial 
fisheries an annual economic loss of 14 billion and some 33600 
jobs in the great lakes basin 
he said the regional great lakes fishery commission based in ann 
arbor mich needs 9 million to keep the lamprey under control 
and the fishery thriving 
lampreys native to the atlantic ocean entered the great lakes 
through the erie canal in the 1880s and decimated the trout 
whitefish and chub populations they attach to fish with their 
sucking mouthpiece and feed on body fluids sometimes killing the 
host 
anyone who has been around long enough can remember a time when 
it seemed every trout and salmon pulled from lake ontario had at 
least one and sometimes more lamprey eels stuck to their side 
horton said the lamprey eel devastated the great lakes fishing 
industry a few years ago but weve come back from it 
the only safe and effective lamprey killer is a chemical tfm 
that is manufactured in west germany horton said but as the value 
of the dollar has dropped against the mark the price of tfm has 
risen he said 
in an effort to find alternatives to the singlesource 
chemical we are requesting 13 million for the us fish and 
wildlife services efforts to develop a sterile male program to 
eradicate the lamprey population he said

strikedevastated eastern airlines won an emergency court order 
forcing rivals to honor pacts with the carrier and a laborbacked 
measure won house approval despite resistance by president bush to 
intervene in the dispute 
the order granted wednesday by a federal bankruptcy judge in new 
york prevents other airlines from refusing to transfer eastern 
passengers cargo and baggage a threat eastern said could doom 
efforts to rebuild the airline 
the judge set a march 24 hearing on continuing the emergency 
order 
in washington on wednesday the house voted 252167 to approve 
laborsuported legislation that would require a recalcitrant bush to 
appoint an emergency panel to try to end the walkout by the 
machinists union pilots and flight attendants 
bush has strongly opposed intervention and so has the 
miamibased company 
its very clear many members were merely voting to satisfy a 
union constituency said eastern spokesman james ashlock adding 
that management remains unalterably opposed to a presidential 
emergency board 
speculation also grew wednesday that as the 13dayold strike 
continues with no sign of resolution selling the crippled carrier 
might be the only alternative for frank lorenzo chairman of its 
parent texas air corp 
texas airs board reportedly has asked its investment banker 
drexel burnham lambert inc to explore the possibility of selling 
eastern to other airlines and investors a move union officials 
found encouraging 
it should be very clear to mr lorenzo and the bankruptcy court 
that any reorganization plan is going to have to be made workable by 
the employees and theyve shown theyre not willing to work for 
him pilots union spokesman ron cole said 
the idea of selling eastern was raised again at a texas air board 
meeting last week the new york times reported wednesday drexel 
spokesman steven anreder said he could not immediately comment on 
the report 
any such action must be approved by us bankruptcy judge burton 
r lifland in new york who is overseeing easterns bankruptcy 
reorganization 
lifland could hold a hearing within a week to 10 days on the sale 
of easterns northeast shuttle to billionaire developer donald trump 
for 365 million said bruce nobles president of the newly formed 
trump shuttle 
union leaders were hoping to head off the sale of the lucrative 
shuttle by finding a friendly buyer for the entire airline 
i cant understand any rationale for jamming the shuttle deal 
through if there is a potential buyer to take care of the whole 
problem said charles e bryan president of district 100 of the 
eastern machinists union 
bryan spoke to corporate raider carl icahn several times last 
year about buying eastern and has been looking for investors to back 
an employee buyout but cole said the unions havent had any direct 
contacts and couldnt discuss any concessions they might make to a 
buyer 
the strike began march 4 with a walkout by 8500 mechanics and 
baggage handlers in a dispute over 125 million in proposed wage 
cuts and escalated with the support of pilots and flight attendants 
five days later eastern filed for bankruptcy reorganization 
eastern has flown about 100 flights a day compared with 1040 
daily before the strike began 
ashlock said eastern was going ahead with plans to renew jetliner 
service thursday on seven roundtrips daily between boston and 
washington but had no immediate plans to renew more routes 
youve got to not only rebuild your flight schedule but 
rebuild your passenger confidence he said were taking on 
pretty short planning phases right now 
ashlock said the company had nothing to say about where it would 
get more pilots to expand service eastern had about 200 pilots 
available compared with 3600 before the strike 
the national air line pilots association has promised 
2400amonth strike pay for eastern pilots alpas 41000 members 
at 47 airlines will be assessed 300 each to help pay for the strike 
pay package

negotiations over the fiscal 1990 budget are 
getting down to the touchy topics of tax increases and entitlement 
cuts but bargainers say decisions are still off on the horizon 
well were going to talk revenues and see where the 
conversation takes us house budget committee chairman leon 
panetta dcalif said wednesday 
although president bush has promised no new taxes his 116 
trillion budget includes 142 billion in new revenues that need to 
be discussed panetta said that figure includes new fees for 
government services and changes in the tax law that the white house 
argues are not tax increases 
the heads of the house and senate taxwriting committees were 
joining the budget talks for todays meetings the conversation was 
also to touch on entitlement programs under those committees 
jurisdiction 
both sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance 
committee and rep dan rostenkowski dill have said their panels 
would not approve the 5 billion in medicare cuts requested by bush 
rostenkowski has also nixed bushs plan to cut the tax rate on 
capital gains 
bentsen on wednesday said 75 billion of the bush tax package 
was based on items congress previously rejected or was unlikely to 
approve the capital gains tax expanding the medicare tax and 
repealing a scheduled cut in the airport excise tax 
i find it troubling that the administration instead of showing 
leaderhip on this issue is effectively leaving it up to congress to 
fill the gap he said 
i know very well the political constraints that the president 
is operating under given the read my lips no new taxes pledge 
he made during the campaign last year bentsen said but i must 
say in all candor im going to do my best to help him but its 
hard to see how the numbers are going to add up 
sen jim sasser dtenn chairman of the senate budget 
committee said the appearance of the taxwriting committees in the 
budget talks did not mean that the panel was leaning toward a tax 
boost 
the negotiators wanted to ascertain from them whats realistic 
by way of spending restraints or what might be realistic by way of 
revenue enhancements he said 
richard darman the director of the office of management and 
budget described the meetings as laying out the options rather than 
hard bargaining 
we still havent really begun what i would call serious 
negotiating he said 
asked when the hard part would begin he said i thought it was 
going to start a long time ago and so far its still going pretty 
well he said

here are excerpts of president mikhail s 
gorbachevs speech wednesday on developing an agrarian policy that 
will be able to restore the peasant as the master on the land and 
dependably resolve the food problem 
they were taken from the englishlanguage translation by the 
official news agency tass 
on the overall problem 
further delay in this matter is simply inadmissible 
drastic changes in the countryside are an essential prerequisite 
for the countrys economic and social progress we all remember 
the concern expressed by delegates to the 19th national party 
conference when discussing the food supply situation in the country 
we described this problem as our societys biggest wound 
the state has to buy large quantities of grain meat fruit 
vegetables sugar vegetable oil and some other staples abroad we 
are still behind developed countries big and small in labor 
efficiency yield capacity and livestock productivity and in the 
diversity and quality of foodstuffs the gap is widening rather than 
narrowing the shortage of food creates social tension and generates 
not merely criticism but actual discontent 
huge capital and other investments have been made in agriculture 
in recent years but the inputs have failed to yield equally 
substantial results 
comrades we should work out an agrarian policy that would enable 
us to blunt the sharp edge of the food problem in the immediate 
future and to grow enough farm produce in terms of both amount and 
choice to stabilize food supplies in the 13th fiveyear plan 
199196 
in the 13th fiveyear period it is planned to increase the 
output of foodstuffs by 26 percent to 30 percent while the output 
of farm produce will grow by 16 percent 
on stalins brutal collectivization of agriculture 
in the process of combatting the kulaks violence was inflicted 
upon the huge mass of middlestrata peasants and even poor ones 
millions of peasants together with their families were torn away 
from their land plots and native areas and suffered misfortunes 
often dying in camps and exile 
on leasing 
let us not fix assignments let us not set deadlines the point 
at issue is the transfer of land and other means of production to 
leaseholders their real control over those means 
if the plenum backs the relevant proposals of the politburo the 
presidium of the ussr supreme soviet and the government and we 
adopt corresponding documents this will create legal and economic 
prerequisites for an extensive transition to leasing 
on price reform 
the purposes of economic restructuring cannot be achieved new 
methods of economic management cannot be introduced and a socialist 
market cannot be formed without a price reform purchase prices 
of some kinds of quality products are so low as not to stimulate the 
development and rational distribution of specialized highly 
marketable production 
the documents circulated among you envisage the introduction of 
new purchase prices of farm produce as of jan 1 1990 the 
range of products priced in a centralized way should be reduced 
on banks 
there is a need for radical restructuring of the activity of 
banks particularly of the agroindustrial bank it is necessary to 
ensure that they are really interested in the development of 
production and act as business partners 
on the independence of agricultural enterprises 
agricultural enterprises are really doubly dependent on the one 
hand they are subordinated to higher bodies along the departmental 
line they are also managed in no less perhaps even in a greater 
degree by local party and government bodies starting from the 
district level 
perestroika presupposes a radical change in the system of 
managing the agrarian sector at all levels we proceeded from 
the assumption that no one should interfere in the daytoday 
economic activities of collective and state farms and still less 
with peasant and individual small holdings 
on equipment problems in agriculture 
workers of the agrarian sector rightly complain that the 
machinemakers abusing their monopoly status often foist upon them 
outdated models of expensive machines with low dependability and 
efficiency standards this is ruinous not only for agriculture but 
for the country as a whole 
we produce more tractors than any other country in the world and 
yet complaints about their short supply are common 
machinemakers should be put in such economic conditions that would 
rule out the manufacture of shoddy equipment 
on waste in agriculture 
our losses in grain harvesting and prestorage treatment amount 
to 15 million and even 20 million tons about as much is lost in 
storage and processing in all comrades the losses equal our 
purchases abroad 
due to the sparsity of meat packing plants their low 
technological standards and inefficient use of raw material meat 
losses even according to the lowest estimates add up to around 1 
million tons this despite the acute shortage of foodstuffs such is 
the dimension of the problem 
many problems stem from the methods of economic management 
peoples attitude to work and their poor motivation to achieve 
better end results 
on ecology 
what must be done as a matter of urgency is putting reclaimed 
lands in proper order and taking measures to put land and water to 
more rational use efforts to come to grips with ecological problems 
that have piled up should not be put off either 
we should drastically raise standards and increase accountablity 
when it comes to the production transportation and storage of 
chemicals and especially their application to the soil 
on life in the villages 
the peasant mode of life has lost its attractiveness and 
prestige people above all the young are leaving villages 
the disregard for the needs of villages and the hypertrophied 
urban development brought about great social distortions and 
complicated the normal economic functioning of whole regions 
the rates of house building in villages in the 13th fiveyear 
period must at least be doubled 
villagers justly raise the issue why rural areas have been put on 
short rations and why peasants have been left to struggle with 
their problems alone although the country has vast resources

legislation that would force president bush to 
intervene in the eastern airlines strike faces stronger opposition 
in the senate but house passage has already given organized labor a 
morale boost 
the house passed the unionsought measure 252167 on wednesday 
largely with the support of the chambers majority democrats only 
20 republicans supported the legislation and just 15 democrats 
voted against it 
president bush opposes the bill and republicans in the senate 
are expected to maneuver to try to block it that chambers tricky 
procedures often allow a minority of legislators to wreak havoc on 
legislation they oppose and the bill is given only a longshot 
chance at ever becoming law 
nonetheless lobbyists for organized labor who have rallied 
around easterns striking unions say they will push hard for senate 
passage 
we trust theyll take it up robert m mcglotten director of 
legislation for the aflcio said after the house vote 
the senate begins a twoweek recess after fridays session and 
supporters of the measure say they would like to see an effort to 
take up the bill before the break time is a factor in the dispute 
with striking workers needing money to pay their bills and eastern 
already having obtained protection from creditors under the 
bankruptcy codes chapter 11 
eastern is demanding 125 million in wage and benefit concessions 
from members of its machinists union which wants 50 million in 
improvements the walkout has forced eastern to fly only about 100 
flights daily compared to 1040 before the strike 
the measure would require a coolingoff period of up to 26 days 
and force bush to appoint an emergency board which would study the 
dispute and recommend a solution neither eastern nor the 
8500member international association of machinists which began 
its walkout march 4 would be required to accept the proposed 
formula 
but even if the measure goes no further than the house it has 
already has cheered labor and its democratic allies 
house passage is a moralebooster to the striking machinists and 
to easterns pilots and flight attendants who have also walked off 
their jobs its an indication to the labor movement that after 
eight years of rough times under the reagan administration it is 
still capable of mustering support in congress 
and it has forced bush and republican lawmakers to appear to be 
defending frank lorenzo chairman of easterns parent company texas 
air corp lorenzo has been accused by workers of trying to break 
easterns unions and dismantle the company and his business 
practices are often criticized by democrats and republicans alike on 
capitol hill including transportation secretary samuel k skinner 
rep douglas bosco dcalif called lorenzo the neutron bomb 
of the airline industry saving assets as booty and taking the 
people and letting them go 
but rep christopher cox rcalif told a reporter i havent 
heard any republican stand up and defend frank lorenzo 
the bills opponents say the eastern walkout has caused 
inconvenience but not a transportation emergency that requires 
government intervention they also note that eastern and the 
machinists began bargaining for a new contract in october 1987 and 
say there is no reason to believe an emergency board would be 
successful 
supporters argued that the emergency board would provide cover 
for the two sides to be able to accept a solution to their bitter 
dispute without appearing to have given in

the top justice officials from all the states 
are targeting rental car practices especially the expensive 
collision damage waivers and ads that they say conceal the true cost 
of car rentals 
the national association of attorneys general adopted guidelines 
this week aimed at encouraging more accurate price disclosure and 
advertising by the rental companies 
the group issued the guidelines after their annual meeting in 
washington ended tuesday and after reviewing the proposals with car 
rental companies 
our investigation uncovered major and pervasive problems in the 
advertising and pricing practices throughout the car rental 
industry robert stephan kansas attorney general said wednesday 
in all too many instances consumers have found it virtually 
impossible to rent an automobile for the price trumpeted in the 
rental companys ads 
illinois attorney general neil hartigan said his state is 
considering filing a lawsuit over allegedly misleading advertising 
by car rental companies 
he said that when the attorneys generals task force began 
looking into the rental practices a year ago rental car ads 
routinely promised low prices that were in fact a complete fiction 
with a bewildering variety of surcharges fees and other mandatory 
addons that drove the final price much higher 
stephan said the industry has since moved to improve advertising 
and eliminate misleading information on prices 
the guidelines are voluntary and intended to advance uniform 
enforcement by providing guidance for the states in enforcing their 
own consumer protection laws and for the companies to avoid 
violating state consumer laws 
under the guidelines 
mandatory fees such as fuel surcharges must be included in the 
advertised price of a car 
advertised prices must clearly and conspicuously disclose 
key restrictions and conditions such as geographic or time 
limitations on price requirements for advance payment and the cost 
of collision damage waivers 
companies must maintain enough cars available at the advertised 
price to meet reasonably expected demand unless the ad clearly 
states supply is limited 
the groups task force that investigated car rentals said it 
found a series of deceptive unfair or unconscionable practices 
involving the waivers including pressure to purchase them by rental 
agents who made commissions on the sale 
in many cases a drivers personal insurance would cover repairs 
the attorneys general recommended state legislatures adopt one of 
three proposed reforms 
prohibit the practice of charging for accidental damage or 
theft thus eliminating the need for the waivers 
limit the amount of money for which consumers can be held liable 
to 500 or less 
require the cost of waivers to be regulated by the state through 
its insurance department or other regulatory agency 
new york attorney general robert abrams said the guidelines had 
been reviewed by the car rental industry and that the industry 
generally had no objection 
joe russo spokesman for hertz corp the largest car rental 
company said it supports the proposed guideline and said it will 
permit comparison shopping demetria mudar spokeswoman for avis 
inc the second largest rental company said it supports the 
guidelines

a congressional subcommittee wants to question 
more than 60 government officials and employees in its investigation 
into alleged improprieties in the food and drug administrations 
processing of generic drug applications 
a federal grand jury in baltimore reportedly is conducting a 
criminal investigation into the matter based on information the 
house energy and commerce subcommittee on oversight and 
investigations uncovered last summer 
the subcommittees investigation is proceeding independently of 
the criminal investigation said rep john dingell dmich 
subcommittee chairman and rep thomas bliley of virginia the 
ranking republican on the panel 
dingell said wednesday that the investigation centers on the 
question of whether fda processed generic drug applications fairly 
and in accordance with the law 
bliley said the panels focus is on the approval process and 
whether or not it has been conducted in a fair and impartial 
manner 
a report in the baltimore sun earlier this week quoted sources as 
saying the grand jury was investigating allegations that fda 
employees took bribes and accepted favors to approve companies 
applications to market generic drugs the newspaper quoted one 
source familiar with the investigation as saying indictments could 
be returned by the end of the month 
generic drugs are lowcost versions of brandname drugs once the 
patent for a brandname drug expires companies can copy the 
compound and apply to the fda for approval of a new generic drug 
dingell and bliley sent a letter to health and human services 
secretary louis sullivan whose department includes fda telling him 
subcommittee investigators want to question employees at fda and in 
the hhs general counsels office 
the lawmakers provided sullivan with a list of 64 employees the 
investigators wanted to interview but the subcommittee did not 
identify them a subcommittee source said all but four of those on 
the list work at fda and they reach as high in the agency as 
commissioner frank young 
dingell noted in the press release that just because a 
government employee is questioned in an investigation of this 
magnitude does not imply any wrongdoing on their part 
dingell and bliley told sullivan that investigators wanted to 
complete the interviews by the end of the month they also submitted 
a list of documents for the department to produce by march 24 and 
noted that most items on the list have been the subject of 
outstanding requests since last summer 
fda spokesman mike shaffer said the agency had no comment but he 
said we of course will cooperate with the investigation the 
agency is anxious to have everything resolved

with millions of pounds of chilean fruit 
being held for testing in us ports because of a cyanide scare 
producers and workers whose livelihoods depend on fruit exports 
seethed with anger 
buy buy dont believe the gringos lies a santiago street 
vendor of grapes chanted wednesday some passersby laughed and many 
made purchases 
producers and union officials say thousands of industry workers 
have been laid off as a result of the scare 
on monday the united states urged consumers not to eat chilean 
fruit after two grapes imported from chile were found to be tainted 
with cyanide 
most chilean fruit was pulled from us markets shelves 
similar decisions were taken by japan and canada and several 
western european countries said they were tightening controls on 
chilean fruit 
chilean exporters growers and packers voluntarily suspended all 
operations tuesday for 72 hours to allow thousands of crates of 
stored fruit to be checked 
the national exporters association said wednesday that not a 
trace of any alien substance had been found in the crates of fruit 
ready for export that had so far been checked 
officials of chiles military government say preliminary 
estimates indicate the crisis could cost chile at least 800 
million nearly 65 percent of chiles fruit exports grapes 
melons apples and peaches go to the united states and the country 
is at the peak of its fruit harvesting season 
the us and japanese embassies in santiago received anonymous 
telephone calls earlier this month saying fruit exports would be 
poisoned an investigation turned up nothing authorities said 
the chilean agriculture minister jaime de la sotta says the 
cyanide found in the two grapes in philadelphia on march 2 amounted 
to 052 parts per million us officials said a child would have to 
eat 2000 grapes to ingest a fatal dose 
wednesday afternoon several of the nations leading fruit 
exporters toured the capitals center street with pickup trucks 
loaded with fruit and gave away grapes and apples to the public 
hundreds of people enthusiastically ate them organizers said the 
idea was to show the world chilean fruit is safe 
most chilean fruit enters the united states through the port of 
philadelphia others through miami los angeles and tampa fla 
boats containing hundreds of thousands of crates of chilean fruit 
awaited off tampa as fruit inspections continued 
in philadelphia food and drug administration officials completed 
sampling wednesday of the 362000 crates of grapes and other fruit 
from chile no further contamination was found 
in chile the president of the central bank enrique seguel 
called the decision to remove the fruit from us stores totally 
out of proportion 
domingo duran president of the national farm producers 
association said nearly 40000 workers had been laid off by 
wednesday but union leaders put the figure at 17000 workers 
the consequences of the thoughtless us decision are worse 
than those of several earthquakes duran told a wednesday news 
conference it is totally irresponsible to react like that because 
of two tainted grapes just two grapes not two clusters 
i directly accuse the united states of paving the way to 
terrorism against the international food trade in the future 
duran said 
he said the us decision will encourage terrorists in the 
future the chilean govenment officialy blamed the tainting of the 
grapes to terrorism backed by the communist party the 
communists denied the charge 
angry reactions came from other quarters too 
alvaro bardon president of the stateowned state bank called 
the us decision an agression almost an act of war 
he blamed certain sectors of the state department which he 
said were influenced by chilean opposition politicians 
scores of citizens interviewed by radio and tv stations also 
strongly criticized the us decision calling it exaggerated

consumers flocked to organic produce markets 
throughout california following reports of tainted chilean grapes 
and unsafe apples 
the chilean situation on top of the alar scare boosted sales 
phenomenally said pam musante produce manager at the sacramento 
natural foods coop 
she said wednesday that sales of organic produce jumped about 30 
percent in the past week 
other organic produce markets reported similar increases in sales 
as a result of the chilean fruit scare and a recent report claiming 
a cancer risk of a chemical called alar used on some apples 
were seeing about 3035 percent increase in our vegetable 
sales and a sixfold increase in sales of organic juices said 
dennis wells owner of the good nature grocery in walnut creek 
about 20 miles east of san francisco 
real food co which owns six stores in san francisco and marin 
county said its sales rose at least 25 percent since both stories 
broke 
the discovery of cyanide in seedless red grapes from chile which 
followed a threatening phone call to a us embassy spurred the 
food and drug administration on monday to recommend that grocers 
strip their shelves of fruits imported from that country 
meanwhile a report last month by the private natural resources 
defense council charging that children are at risk from alar led 
schools nationwide including san francisco los angeles chicago 
and new york to ban apples 
alar the brand name for daminozide is used to improve the 
coloring of apples and slow ripening but it is suspected of causing 
cancer 
in southern california sandy gooch an owner of six mrs goochs 
markets reported record sales ted mccaskey manager of erewhon 
natural foods in los angeles estimated a 5 percent increase in 
customers 
traditionally organic produce sales have been through farmers 
markets and health food stores and more recently through grocery 
chains 
but theres certainly not enough certified product to handle 
the demand said phil mcgee administrative assistant for santa 
cruzbased california certified organic farmers an association of 
about 400 growers 
obviously theres a big demand for it right now said mike 
duncan coowner of calorganic farms south of bakersfield even 
before the publicity there was a steady flow but now the interest 
level has increased drastically 
under california law produce can be called organic if no 
synthetic chemicals have been applied since 12 months prior to 
planting or bud break said mcgee 
the organic farmers group goes even further before certifying a 
farm as organic the process takes at least a year and includes soil 
residue analysis inspection of the farm by an independent 
inspector a notarized affidavit and full disclosure of materials 
used in production and a land history for 10 years mcgee said

state representatives have approved a bill 
that could make ohio the third state to legalize casino gambling 
the proposal approved by the house 5742 wednesday would limit 
the operation to a fiveyear pilot project in the northeastern ohio 
city of lorain 
the bill was sent to the senate where a democratic leader 
predicted passage but democratic gov richard celeste refused to 
say whether he would approve the proposal 
senate minority leader harry meshel a democrat said he thinks 
the bill could provide a badly needed economic boost for northeast 
ohio and i havent heard a lot of opposition to it i think its 
going to pass 
new jersey and nevada are the only states that have legalized 
casino gambling 
debate in the house involved claims that the bill would damage 
the states image and hurt its economy 
republican rep james petro argued that industries considering 
locating in ohio might look elsewhere out of family and community 
considerations gambling does not provide real jobs or real 
growth he contended 
backers of the legislation said that an envisioned 300 million 
casino will have a major impact on the states economy not only in 
lorain but all across northern ohio including cleveland 40 miles 
to the east 
the bill provides that if voters in lorain approve of the 
venture the casino would be overseen by a state commission of five 
members to be named by the governor

a 25yearold computer hacker once declared 
a very very great danger to the community pleaded guilty to 
computer fraud in a plea bargain with federal prosecutors 
kevin david mitnick would be sentenced to 12 months in prison and 
three years on supervised release under terms of the agreement 
the pudgy youthful looking mitnick was described by friends as a 
computer genius who called himself condor and was capable of 
infiltrating any computer system 
mitnick pleaded guilty wednesday to charges he infiltrated 
digital equipment corps computer system and stole one of its 
programs and admitted stealing 16 mci telephone codes and using 
them to make phone calls it was not clear whether the long distance 
codes were used to access computer systems 
prosecutors agreed to dismiss two additional charges one of 
which alleged that mitnick infiltrated the computer system of leeds 
university in england 
us district judge mariana pfaelzer declined prosecutors 
recommendations until mitnick is interviewed by probation department 
authorities she noted that he has a prior conviction for similar 
activities in santa cruz and set sentencing for april 24 
at a bail hearing on jan 3 pfaelzer denied bail for the 
defendant saying mitnick posed a very very great danger to the 
community reflecting public comments made by assistant us 
attorney leon weidman 
even mitnicks access to the telephone was restricted mitnicks 
lawyer alan rubin has maintained that prosecution comments about 
the case were wildly exaggerated 
on wednesday rubin said outside court that mitnick had expressed 
a desire to undergo psychological counseling which also was part of 
the plea agreement 
hes a very talented man with a lot of ability and for whatever 
reason theres been a misuse of that ability said rubin a 
computer company that could harness his abilities would really get a 
talented employee 
rubin said mitnick never intended to damage computer systems or 
to sell information for profit 
assistant us attorney james asperger said the government based 
its sentencing recommendation on digitals estimate that mitnicks 
actions had cost the firm between 100000 and 200000 in down 
time on its computer 
he said the computer system had to be shut down while the firm 
looked for damage the governments initial estimates of damage to 
digitals system were set at 4 million 
it turned out there was no damage to the overall system asperger 
said although mitnick was able to steal and copy one program 
mitnick already has served more than three months in prison and 
rubin added hell be out by christmas

japans research whaling program is too small to be 
scientifically accurate so more whales should be killed next year 
the head of the program said today 
fukuzo nagasaki director of the semigovernmental institute of 
cetacean research said the 300 whales being caught by japanese 
ships in the antarctic this year are not enough to make an accurate 
assessment of whale stocks and should be increased to 825 next 
season 
critics have charged that japan is using the research program to 
continue its whaling industry despite a worldwide moratorium on 
commercial whaling imposed in 1986 by the international whaling 
commission 
japan officially ended its commercial whaling at the end of the 
198687 season when it caught 1941 whales the following season it 
told the commission it would kill 875 minke and sperm whales for 
research purposes which are permitted under the commissions 
charter 
but strong opposition from international environmental groups and 
some commission members led japan to cut back the research programs 
goal last season to 300 minke whales japanese whalers actually 
caught 273 minkes during the year officials say 
the sampling method we applied worked very well so we are sure 
that this method can be applied to somewhat largerscale research 
nagasaki told reporters at the foreign correspondents club of japan 
we are thinking of resuming our original plan from next year if 
circumstances permit 
the whale meat obtained by japans research program is sold for 
food as permitted under international whaling commission 
regulations 
the whaling fleet made up of one mother ship and three catcher 
boats is due to return to japan from the antarctic about april 20 
he said 
the commission passed the whaling moratorium to allow whale 
populations to be studied without being hunted the ban is to be 
reevaluated by the commission next year and japan hopes its 
research will show that some species such as the smaller minke are 
plentiful enough to allow a limited resumption of commercial whaling 
current estimates of minke populations range from 400000 to 
700000

communist party leaders today rallied around 
president mikhail s gorbachevs plan to give peasants control of 
the land they farm and the crops they plant in a drive to overcome 
chronic food shortages tass said 
speakers urged the 300member central committee to approve the 
radical reform plan which gorbachev said would end decades of 
power and pressure methods that have brought disaster to the 
soviet countryside according to the official news agency 
in a nearly twohour speech on wednesday gorbachev painted a 
bleak picture of soviet agriculture with chemically despoiled land 
investments gone sour and the deliberate destruction of traditional 
systems the situation is so bad that it will be years before the 
country can feed itself he said 
the central committee was expected to approve the policy today 
although conservatives such as agriculture chief yegor k ligachev 
have not been enthusiastic about leasing collective farm land to 
families and groups 
gorbachevs detailed report on years of failed reforms made it 
clear that he believes nothing less than radical change will free 
soviets from rationing of meat and cheese now found in many cities 
his proposal to abolish a government superagency created in 1985 
to oversee the countrys farm sector was a tacit acknowledgement of 
the failure of even his early attempts to revitalize agriculture 
essentially gorbachevs plan would give farmers freedom to 
choose their own crops equipment and markets prices would be 
adjusted and eventually nearly decontrolled 
a draft law on leasing was presented to the party and gorbachev 
said it could be decreed by the government presidium that implied 
he would not wait for installation of the nations new parliament 
which is expected in may 
it will take time however to replace the current system with 
one allowing farmers to choose and pay for their own seed equipment 
and fertilizer 
leasing experiments have been going on for a year but approval 
of the plan would make leasing standard rather than the exception 
gorbachev called food shortages our societys biggest wound 
meat sugar and many other foodstuffs must be rationed in numerous 
soviet regions 
the central committee began a twoday meeting wednesday largely 
devoted to agricultural reform seeking ways to increase the food 
supply and improve dreary rural life 
when josef stalin forced agricultural collectivization in the 
1930s on a populace that was 80 percent agrarian millions of 
peasants were deported to siberia and other remote regions or fled 
to cities catastrophic famine ensued 
ever since farmers working for stateowned farms have generally 
delivered their yields to market at fixed prices to meet quotas set 
by the state bureaucracy 
the 58yearold gorbachev the former party overseer for 
agriculture and son of a russian peasant said conditions in some 
rural regions were causing mass migration to cities 
in 1988 gross soviet farm output rose by just 07 percent and 
grain harvested was only 195 million metric tons 16 million below 
the annual average achieved in 198687 according to 
washingtonbased planecon inc 
gorbachev said leaseholders should be given a virtual free hand 
he has said leasing guarantees higher production because 
leaseholders can earn more if they work harder rather than getting 
a fixed salary regardless of output 
gorbachev said more flexible prices for crops purchased by 
the state would go into effect jan 1 and the number of products 
for which prices are fixed would be reduced 
however gorbachev said food shortages could not be expected to 
end until the mid1990s 
ligachev has emphasized collective farming the system that has 
left soviets standing in line for meat and vegetables 
no one proposed letting farmers own outright the land or the 
breakup of the collective and state farms that have been the 
backbone of the soviet agricultural system since the 1930s

fokker the dutch aerospace group 
that was near collapse just 16 months ago is close to wrapping up a 
3 billion deal involving the sale of 150 passenger jets to american 
airlines a company spokesman confirmed today 
were discussing the final minor details on the deal valued 
at 65 billion guilders or 309 billion said fokker spokesman 
bart van veen 
the sale includes 75 firm orders and 75 options that are to be 
placed by the fort worth texasbased airline for fokkers 100seat 
f100 twin jet a plane for feeder routes of up to 1100 nautical 
miles van veen said 
it was not immediately known when the contracts would be signed 
van veen said 
americans order considered a crucial breakthrough for fokker 
into the us aviation market was billed as the largestever deal 
in dutch industrial history 
the deal which took five years to negotiate is the latest stage 
in the recovery of the dutch aviation company which almost 
collapsed in 1987 under the financial burden of developing two new 
models the f100 and the f50 propjet 
in a controversial bailout that year the dutch government put 
up 212 million guilders to support fokker the move involving the 
purchase of fokker stock at roughly 10 a share resulted in the 
government becoming the majority shareholder with a 318 percent 
interest 
it looks like the government did a good deal said van veen 
noting that at midday trading on the amsterdam bourse fokker shares 
were up 370 guilders to 4580 guilders or 2180 a share 
fokkers order books for the f100 now show 212 firm sales and 
178 options van veen said adding that americans options may be 
described as very firm ones among other us f100 buyers is 
washingtonbased usair which has 20 planes on order 
van veen said that since fokkers amsterdam production line has 
an annual maximum capacity of 46 f100 jets were now looking to 
expand our production capacity in the united states northern 
ireland or at home 
in the united states fokker has had talks with lockheed aircraft 
corp grumman corp and rockwell international corp to set up a 
second f100 production line while the dutch company also is 
involved in takeover talks concerning short brothers ltd of

the contra army stranded near here 
may be a headache for diplomats and a political problem in the 
united states but it has also brought a minor economic boom to the 
isolated valleys of eastern honduras 
im doing very well nowadays all is calm said eulogio 
chavez montoya owner of the vendita miraflores store pointing to 
racks of cowboy boots at 80 lempiras each about 27 at the black 
market rate 
buildings throughout town are freshly painted and small stores 
are packed with everything from soccer balls to corn flakes 
families that never had electricity own generators drink 
refrigerated cokes and watch cagney and lacey via satellite 
dishes 
the boom began a little more than a year ago when the us 
congress cut military aid to the nicaraguan rebels trying to topple 
the leftist sandinista government led by president daniel ortega 
the contras filtered out of nicaragua as they exhausted supplies 
about 11000 fighters and thousands of family members now are living 
in camps a few miles from the border supported by us aid 
many local hondurans who in thploded killing one of her nieces and 
wounding four other children 
farther from the camps the most common complaint about the 
contra presence was drunken driving i guess since they cant 
fight they have to entertain themselves said cesar rodas 21 of 
danli 
valentin valladardes who started a tire repair business in danli 
with a rented air compressor said he was trying to ride out an 
industry shakeout too many people competing for truck drivers 
business 
his wife said honduran criminals escape justice by joining the 
rebels a contra mechanic heatedly replied that the contras are 
being blamed for anything that goes wrong within 50 miles 
the 100 families of capiri turned into refugees themselves in 
1985 when there was frequent fighting in the border region 
we had to get out of here said jose medina a 63yearold 
storeowner now theres more confidence in being able to work 
its all up to president bush medina added tell him not 
to turn up the flame

fred haymans blueprint for building the first 
american house of fragrances specifies a pyramidshaped 
cornerstone 
hayman the man behind one of the perfume industrys most 
successful scents is introducing a new concoction that he thinks 
may create an even bigger splash than giorgio beverly hills 
his new fragrance is called 273 for the address on rodeo 
drive of the sumptuous beverly hills boutique that was the 
birthplace of the giorgio perfume it comes in a crystal flacon 
designed by hayman in a pyramid shape 
if his dreams of 273s popularity come true hayman says he 
intends to expand his fragrance collection under the provisional 
banner clientele privee his interpretation of a parisian perfumery 
but hayman doesnt want an exact repeat of the giorgio success 
story 
that fragrance family which he sold to cosmetics and toiletries 
company avon for 165 million in 1987 became phenomenally popular 
after its debut in 1981 despite haymans emphasis on exclusivity 
giorgio eventually became widely available in department stores and 
elsewhere losing some allure in the process 
hayman says it was difficult to resist demands from retail 
outlets clamoring to stock giorgiobut i will this time because 
im convinced small is beautiful says the man who pioneered the 
use of scent strips in magazines as a comeon for giorgio 
at first 273 will be sold solely through the boutique that has 
been rechristened fred hayman beverly hills 
its pricey having an elevated prestige status among its 
perfume peers one ounce of the perfume costs 185 and 25 ounces of 
the cologne goes for 45 
if demand for 273 takes off hayman will face some ticklish 
marketing 
prestige products pose salespitch paradoxes people who fancy 
such goods from perfumes to watches to the latest exotic dog breed 
typically dont want things just anybody can buy 
so from a merchandizing standpoint the problem becomes one of 
satisfying demand enough to stimulate interest but not so much that 
the product loses the special cachet that scarcity supplies 
moreover the availability of prestige perfumes is overflowing 
movie stars from elizabeth taylor to cher clothing designers and 
entertainers have added their own contributions to the gushing 
stream of new products 
a footnote to the recent history of numerous perfume 
introductions is the us debut in march of fragrances by bic corp 
of throwaway razor ballpoint pen and cigarette lighter fame 
andrew shore who follows the scent business for shearson lehman 
hutton inc says the lifespan of perfumes is frequently as short as 
12 to 24 months if a fragrance lingers for four years or so it is 
considered a franchise from which successful spinoff products can be 
derived 
incredibly saturated is how shore describes the market 
adding that it is polarized with ultra highpriced items at one 
extreme and mass market stuff at the other 
unit sales have fallen for the past five years he says modest 
growth in sales value occurred because new fragrances fetch 
increasingly higher prices he estimates retail sales rose to 325 
billion in 1988 up from 315 billion a year earlier 
hayman has a simple answer to whether 273 will rise to the top 
theres always a market for the best he said during an 
interview while on one of his frequent trips to new york 
273 is described as a flowery fruity spicy blend of more than 
250 ingredients with the key ones being gardenia tuberose and 
jasmine its components are expensive and so is its packaging 
the crystal pyramidshaped bottle is embossed with a 24 karat 
gold line surrounding the stopper bright yellow reminiscent of the 
giorgio hue and haymans favorite color and fireengine red are 
used for 273 as well as for the beverly hills store 
during a conversation hayman who left his native switzerland 
for the united states in 1941 and speaks swiss french and english 
gives the impression he would rather not know the word discount 
in any language 
his boutique which claims to have the highest sales per square 
foot of any store in the country never marks down prices on 
merchandise for more than 20 years of running the store hayman has 
had the good fortune to discover littleknown designers who 
cultivated big followings such as halston 
the boutique was originally called giorgio by george grant who 
decided to italianize his name because italian imports accounted for 
much of the clothing carried in the shop hayman bought out grant 
and another partner in the mid1960s 
hayman seems to embody beverly hills he owns a vintage rolls 
royce and is definitely a have not a havenot 
recently he appeared fit and pleasantly tanned clad in a 
expensively styled suit recovering from back surgery required after 
years of jogging he was more comfortable standing through an 
hourlong interview in his suite at a chic hotel on the east side of 
manhattans central park 
when his former wife gale came up with the idea that blossomed 
into giorgio perfume hayman was disinterested at first i 
thought it was not a good idea he says he doesnt normally wear 
fragrances himself but now the business is in his blood 
at 63 hayman says he has no intention of retiring anytime soon 
and hopes to establish his clientele privee french for private 
client as a perfume powerhouse

the bush administration which is asking banks 
to forgive voluntarily part of the 410 billion debt owed by third 
world countries opposes establishing an international agency that 
could require writing off some of the loans congress was told today 
assistant treasury secretary david mulford the principal 
architect of the voluntary debtforgiveness plan said such an 
agency would cause more interruptions in the repayment of loans and 
interest and further reduce the value of the loans in secondary 
markets 
congress last year directed president reagan to explore setting 
up an international debt management authority that could require 
renegotiation of the loans on more favorable terms to developing 
countries many lenders have been able to get only 40 percent of the 
loans face value in selling them to other lenders 
we have concluded after months of study that debt reduction and 
debt service reduction can be successfully accomplished in the 
marketplace mulford told the senate banking committees 
subcommittee on international finance and monetary policy 
we believe that a marketoriented approachaddresses 
congressional concerns with less risk to taxpayers than a new 
international agency would he said 
the panels chairman sen paul sarbanes dmd praised the 
administration for recognizing the necessity of forgiving some of 
the debt 
to paraphrase winston churchill this is not so much the 
beginning of the end or even the end of the beginning but it is 
perhaps the beginning of the beginning sarbanes said 
treasury secretary nicholas brady told the house ways and means 
committee on wednesday that many of the details are likely to be 
worked out only after individual negotiations begin with some of the 
major third world debtors major us economic allies banks and 
international institutions 
brady unveiled the plan in a speech last friday in which he 
conceded that the socalled 1985 baker plan named for his 
predecessor at treasury and now secretary of state james a baker 
iii had largely failed in solving the third world debt crisis 
instead of asking banks to forgive a portion of their loans to 
impoverished debtsaddled nations in latin america the baker plan 
called on them to write new loans for countries willing to make 
government enterprises private and institute austerity programs 
many countries did but few new loans were written by private 
banks and much of the new money that did come forth from 
international lending institutions such as the world bank was used 
by many debtor nations to pay the interest on their loans to private 
banks 
brady suggested us banks could be encouraged to forgive a 
portion of their loans with guarantees that the world bank or the 
international monetary fund would provide if necessary money to 
the debtor countries to make interest payments on their remaining 
balances 
at least youre moving in the right direction decreasing 
their debt instead of increasing it rep thomas downey dny a 
member of the ways and means committee told brady 
in outlining the new plan brady said only through voluntary debt 
and debtservice reduction can some developing countries ever hope 
to restore their credit worthiness 
bush did not publicly endorse the new plan until tuesday raising 
questions about whether the initiative was bradys alone or had the 
backing of the full administration 
brady acknowledged wednesday there was some confusion in the 
administration but said his speech outlining the new strategy had 
been approved in advance by the president 
major us lender banks have vigorously resisted efforts by some 
lawmakers among them sen bill bradley dnj to force them to 
write off a portion of their third world debts 
acrosstheboard mandatory solutions are simply not the 
answer william rhodes head of debt restructuring at citicorp 
told the house banking committee earlier this year 
he said imposed debt forgiveness would seriously retard the 
ability of third world debtors to return for new loans 
but with riots two weeks ago in venezuela over austerity programs 
and radical political movements on both the left and right 
threatening many fragile latin democracies the bush administration 
is now looking at third world debt as a national security issue as 
well as an economic one 
us banks now hold 977 billion of third world debt compared 
with nearly 140 billion six and onehalf years ago when the crisis 
was precipitated by mexico stopping interest payments on its debt 
because of plummeting oil prices 
the six largest borrowers argentina brazil chile mexico 
venezuela and the philippines now owe those nine banks some 47 
billion less than the 65 billion of their combined capital bases

its been a year since rebellious executives 
walked out of advertising agency lord geller federico einstein inc 
to start their own a split that has left two emotionally scarred 
rivals and courtroom accusations of business sabotage 
lord gellers biggest client international business machines 
corp took its business elsewhere a legal dispute on the breakup 
remains unresolved two agencies now use the lord name in their 
logos 
moreover lord geller and the new agency lord einstein oneill amp 
partners combined handle only about 60 percent of the business and 
employ only about twothirds as many people as lord geller did 
before the breakup 
the saga has drawn attention outside the advertising world 
because it has raised questions about the impact of executive 
defections in other service industries such as law and accounting 
some ad agency folks took delight in the courage the breakaway 
executives showed in leaving citing a desire for autonomy but at 
the same time they sympathized with those left behind 
a marketing consultant who advises advertisers about selecting an 
ad agency said the lingering legal controversy about the breakup may 
be frightening some potential clients from considering either agency 
in making a search for a new agency a company is looking for a 
long term stable relationship and i think both agencies at the 
moment are viewed as kind of unstable agencies said stanley 
canter of canter achenbaum associates 
lord geller however insists it has stabilized with billings of 
50 million and a payroll of 100 people down from 212 million in 
billings and 320 employees before the breakup 
billings reflect the amount of money advertisers pay for 
broadcast and published ads agencies often get a percentage of 
billings for their work 
lord einstein said its growth from zero to 75 million in 
billings and 82 employees in its first year makes it one of the 
fastest growing startups 
of those employed at lord geller before the breakup between 65 
and 70 still work there while about 40 are working for lord 
einstein about 210 have gone elsewhere either because they were 
laid off or quit 
ad industry analysts say the deep pockets of lord gellers 
parent the britainbased wpp group may guarantee its survival 
wpps chief executive martin sorrell is believed to be committed to 
maintaining lord geller as a second ad network separate from wpps 
other agency j walter thompson co 
lord einstein also has a powerful partner the ad agency young amp 
rubicam which holds a 49 percent stake in the new agency 
richard j lord helped found lord geller federico einstein inc 
in 1967 five years later lord and his partners sold the agency to 
j walter thompson 
the agency probably is bestknown for its ibm work especially 
the campaign that used the charlie chaplin little tramp 
character to show how ibms personal computers can bring order to 
the most chaotic businesses 
along with thompson lord geller was purchased as part of wpp 
groups unsolicited 566 million acquisition of jwt group inc in 
july 1987 
lord and other top executives of lord geller chafed under 
sorrells rule and after sorrell rejected a buyout proposal they 
decided to leave 
on march 18 1988 lord and another lord geller founder arthur 
w einstein jr joined four other lord geller executives in the 
walkout leaving only a memo to announce their resignations to the 
people they left behind 
the 63yearold lord whose plans to retire at age 64 were put on 
hold indefinitely with the new agency startup concedes it was a 
terrible way to do it but said his lawyers advised against telling 
the staff in person 
j william wardell the only member of the sevenperson 
management committee at lord geller who did not defect recalls 
hearing a roar build outside his office as copies of the memo were 
dropped outside each door 
he promptly assembled a group to keep the agency running and 
contacted clients about what had occurred 
within three weeks lord einstein hired about 40 people most of 
them lord geller colleagues who wanted to join their old bosses and 
signed exlord geller clients wnbctv and the new yorker magazine 
sorrell sued the defecting managers accusing them of a 
conspiracy to sabotage their old agency the executives denied it a 
new york state court judge barred lord einstein from signing lord 
geller clients 
but as of this past week the judge had not entered a final ruling 
and had not dealt with the phase of the case in which damages if 
any will be determined 
within a month of the breakaway sorrell appointed wardell as 
president of lord geller and hired two outsiders to help him run the 
agency agi clark of nw ayer and tim elliott of ogilvy amp mather 
ms clark said she was enticed by the challenge of proving wrong 
everybody who thought it was going to fall apart 
in the next few months anne klein ii fashions the wall street 
journal and a division of fuji photo film co left lord geller but 
schieffelin amp somerset co kept its hennessey cognac there as did 
the contel corp corporate account 
lord einstein meanwhile got special projects from ibm with the 
courts consent and added a 30 million account from saab scania of 
north america 
both agencies were shut out however when ibm took its 100 
million account to two other agencies in september ibm accounted 
for about half of lord gellers billings 
eight days after that decision lord geller laid off 90 people 
trying to cushion the blow by giving fired employees three months 
severance pay another layoff in december and attrition reduced the 
work force further 
lord geller shifted sights to new business it landed a lederle 
laboratories drug account sheridan home furnishing and contel 
telephone operations travel publishing computers fashion and 
financial services are areas lord geller is pursuing 
lord einstein reached the breakeven point in january lord said 
and is on the hunt for clients in food travel fashion and high 
technology 
lord said his group had no way of knowing when they left that his 
old agency would lose clients and have to trim the payroll so much 
what we left there was a healthy agency lord said he blames 
the postbreakup problems on sorrell 
but even at that lord said he tries to keep tabs on what has 
happened to his former employees and said nearly all have found 
other ad jobs 
so how does he feel about having his name on two agency doors 
i dont feel any better about it than martin does lord said 
lord geller considered changing its name but decided against it 
our victory will be all the sweeter with the same name said ms 
clark

interior secretary manuel lujan says federal law 
should allow economic considerations to be taken into account in 
deciding whether to protect species like the northern spotted owl 
im told on the one hand that i want to protect an endangered 
species he told the seattle postintelligencer on wednesday on 
the other hand i hear thats going to devastate the entire 
northwest lumber industry 
how do we solve that problem i believe we should be able to 
take economic considerations into account 
lujans comments made in washington dc came the same day a 
federal judge refused to delay the sale of timber on as much as 
50000 acres of us forest service land in washington state and 
oregon that is home to the spotted owl 
us district judge william dwyers ruling left forest service 
plans for protecting the owl in effect pending trial on an effort by 
environmentalists to preserve even more habitat timber companies 
say the current setasides are excessive 
the forest service is in the agriculture department outside 
lujans control but lujan said he expects to receive 
recommendations may 1 from the us fish and wildlife service on 
whether to list the owl as endangered 
such a designation sought by environmentalists to protect 
forests in the pacific northwest from logging could mean the loss 
of thousand of jobs in the region timber industry officials have 
said 
maybe we should change the law to consider such economic 
factors lujan said he added that the spotted owl business is 
probably the prime example 
sen brock adams dwash responding to a query on monday said 
a legislative proposal along the lines lujan suggested on wednesday 
would create a national furor and turn the rest of the country 
against you 
i dont think such an effort to change the endangered species 
act would get anywhere in congress he said 
similar views were expressed by rep peter defazio dore whose 
district leads the nation in the harvest of national forest timber 
he said log exports rather than environmental laws have caused 
domestic timber shortages 
i think there will be a natural emotional reaction to demand 
that the spotted owl be exempt from the endangered species act 
said defazio its a simple solution blame the owl but some 
people are bashing the environment as a smoke screen 
dwyer also rejected a request by the washington contract loggers 
association to stop the forest service from reducing the allowable 
timber cut that issue too should be resolved at trial or in 
negotiations he said 
the judge asked all parties to state by march 29 what should be 
done to resolve the issue the suit filed feb 8 claimed the 
agencys owl management plan failed to set aside enough land to 
protect the bird 
im really delighted with the decision because it buys us time 
which i feel is what we need said rep jolene unsoeld 
unsoeld said in a telephone interview from washington dc that 
small mill owners labor and environmentalists have indicated a 
willingness to discuss how to maintain a sustainable timber 
industry as well as achieve some of the environmental objectives 
todd true an attorney for the sierra club legal defense fund 
said environmentalists were reviewing their options 
the biological evidence is that the owl is at the threshold of 
extinction and that it can not afford to lose additional habitat 
he said 
the forest service plan approved in december called for 
designation of 374000 acres of mature and oldgrowth timber in 13 
national forests as habitat for what the agency estimates are 2000 
breeding pairs of spotted owls in washington and oregon

the federal communications commission today 
abolished regulations by which american telephone amp telegraph co 
has set longdistance rates for more than two decades 
the unanimous commission vote which came after two years of 
hearings and filings from consumer groups congress and the 
telephone industry would replace atampts socalled rateofreturn 
regulations on july 1 with a formula designed to drive rates down 
and save consumers an estimated 900 million over four years 
fcc chairman dennis patrick described the commission action as 
a major milestonein our approach to our understanding of the 
regulatory process 
he said it was time to move on from the rateofreturn process 
established for the old bell system in the 1960s 
we simply can no longer have a regulatory approach that was 
crafted in the 1960s to use that system in the 1990s and beyond it 
is simply outdated he said 
commissioner patricia diaz dennis said she favored the plan but 
with some concern particularly over a provision that would limit 
how far atampt could lower its longdistance rates but she said i 
do support this grand experiment 
commissioner james quello also said he had concerns about the 
floors on atampt rates and said he hoped they could be lifted quickly 
in future fcc rulings but he described rate caps as a 
precedentsetting issue that is really going to benefit the 
public he said the rate cap plan was long overdue 
patrick said local telephone companies will not come under the 
rate cap plan at this point but that they would be included by july 
1 1990 he said the commission was going to accept further public 
comment on that issue and asked the local companies to submit plans 
to use rate caps by may 17 
patrick said he thought he had calmed the waters in congress over 
rate caps where there has been great concern that residential 
consumers would not be wellprotected particularly rural telephone 
users 
patrick maintains the plan would save consumers 900 million by 
letting atampt establish its interstate prices under a prescribed 
formula 
but the socalled price caps proposal may be derailed in 
congress where opposition ranges from outright hostility to the 
view that the plan could be salvaged if it included better 
safeguards for consumers particularly rural telephone users 
congressional concern over rate caps which patrick first 
proposed in a speech more than two years ago caused him to postpone 
a vote on the plan in january 
he tried to assuage congressional concerns about consumers this 
week in a lengthy response to a set of questions from sen daniel k 
inouye dhawaii who chairs the communications subcommittee of the 
senate commerce science and transportation committee 
on the house side energy and commerce chairman john dingell 
dmich and rep edward markey dmass who chairs the 
telecommunications and finance subcommittee have been openly 
critical of patricks proposal 
a house subcommittee member rep jim cooper dtenn introduced 
legislation earlier this month that would prevent implementation of 
price caps until congress can study the proposal more thoroughly 
cooper said he wanted explicit assurances in the plan that 
universal telephone service and subsidies for highcost telephone 
service in remote areas would be maintained and that longdistance 
rates would not rise disproportionately in those remote areas 
since the 1960s atampt has been subject to socalled 
rateofreturn regulation that allows it a certain profit beyond 
costs currently atampt can earn about 12 percent above its expenses 
patricks plan would allow atampt to raise its rates 3 percent less 
than the rate of inflation in effect a 3 percent cut with an 
additional 2 percent reduction for residential and small business 
users 
but if atampt could lower its expenses under such a system its 
profits would increase 
rates would be set on three categories or baskets of atampt 
service residential and small business 800 services and all other 
business services within the residentialsmall business basket 
prices in the individual categories could not increase by more then 
5 percent plus the change in inflation rate 
rep rick boucher dva said at a hearing last month on the 
plan that the fcc should require atampt to share with customers half 
of any windfall profits arising from the plan 
another subcommittee member rep tom tauke riowa said the 
revised plan had removed floors on prices in each of the 
categories the plan as outlined by patrick only would maintain 
ceilings on how high such prices could go 
tauke said that without floors atampt possibly could lower prices 
far enough to drive out competition but patrick said floors could 
discourage atampt from increasing efficiency to lower prices 
patricks plan would cover all dominant interstate carriers for 
atampt specificially it would cap prices for a period of four years 
the 3 percent reduction would be imposed after adjustments for 
cost changes outside of atampts control such as the charges that 
local phone companies require atampt to pay to connnect with the local 
phone networks

the futures industry will ultimately be 
strengthened if its leaders take a direct approach to issues raised 
by a federal investigation of commodity trading fraud the head of 
the industrys largest trade association said today 
we cant make the chicago investigation go away but in the end 
it will become one of those events in our history which hardens the 
steel from which we will build the futures industry of the 1990s 
said david ganis chairman of the futures industry association 
in his keynote speech at the opening of the groups annual 
meeting here ganis said the futures industry association is 
committed to promoting the highest ethical standards within the 
industry and will support all appropriate actions to protect the 
interest of the customers who rely on these markets 
trust is the very cornerstone of our ability to do business 
ganis told more than 1000 brokerage executives exchange officials 
and regulators attending the meeting at the posh boca raton hotel 
and club 
the meeting follows by two months the disclosure of an undercover 
federal probe of suspected fraud at the chicago board of trade and 
the chicago mercantile exchange the worlds two largest futures 
exchanges 
no charges have yet been issued in connection with the probe 
anton valukas the us attorney in chicago would not comment on 
rumors circulating among defense lawyers that six people would soon 
be charged 
the probe is believed to be targeting as many as 100 traders 
suspected of systematically cheating customers out of millions of 
dollars while executing their orders on the trading floors of the 
two chicago exchanges 
futures are contracts to buy and sell commodities and financial 
instruments at a specified price on a future date 
the investigation has focused attention on certain trading 
practices that can lead to cheating critics say 
chief among these is dual trading the longestablished practice 
among floor brokers of trading for their own accounts and their 
customers accounts at the same time 
ganis said the commodity futures trading commission a federal 
regulatory agency has asked his association to submit its own 
analysis of dual trading the cftc is seeking similar responses from 
futures exchanges in chicago and new york 
ganis who heads northern futures corp a chicagobased futures 
brokerage also said the federal investigation calls into question 
the adequacy of selfregulation of the futures industry 
under the existing selfregulatory system the cftc allows 
individual exchanges to make and administer their own trading rules 
cftc chairman wendy gramm who also spoke at the the meeting this 
morning said selfregulation had worked well in the past and called 
for renewed diligence among futures exchanges and brokerage firms in 
detecting and punishing wrongdoing 
i know that you have the incentive to root out fraud and abuse 
in these markets she said so do we and we will continue to be 
aggressive in this regard

southern catfish farmers long unable to penetrate 
the huge but finicky new england seafood market are finally winning 
over yankees by abandoning the hush puppy approach in favor of 
lemonpepper marinade and recipes like catfish and artichoke au 
gratin 
using a traveling chef to tout nouvelle catfish the nations 
largest processor delta pride catfish inc of indianola miss 
says it has tripled sales in new england during the last six months 
down south its catfish hush puppies cole slaw and french 
fries delta pride president sam hinote said at a recent 
fishindustry trade show in boston but we know that just doesnt 
go up here 
what does go said lisa martel executive chef at rebeccas 
restaurant on beacon hill is catfish in lemoncaper beurre blanc 
weve had it on the menu for four months ms martel said 
at first it wasnt really accepted but now its selling very 
well 
southern farmers searching for an alternative to depressed row 
crops like cotton and soybeans began raising catfish in shallow 
fresh water ponds in the early 1970s 
production has grown at a compound rate of more than 30 percent a 
year from fewer than 5 million pounds in 1970 to more than 295 
million in 1988 us department of agriculture figures show 
in mississippi where 85 percent of the nations catfish are 
raised more than 7000 people now work in the industry retail 
sales in restaurants and supermarkets estimated at about 10 
million in 1970 topped 600 million last year 
almost all of those sales however were in the south and 
midwest although new englanders are the nations largest per capita 
consumers of seafood they have long spurned catfish a fact that 
delta pride conagra inc and other major processors realize they 
must reverse if they are to continue their rapid growth 
people up here still think catfish are the ugly old things that 
huck finn pulled off the bottom of the mississippi said hinote 
if we had the image of say rainbow trout wed be selling 
billions of pounds not millions 
delta prides touring chef john folse is trying to capture that 
clean upscale image with recipes like grilled fillet of catfish 
with dijon mustard catfish and artichoke au gratin and cajun 
catfish with oysters and andouille sausage 
conagras country skillet catfish division meanwhile is 
breaking into the new england market with premarinated packs of 
fish in flavors like cajun lemonpepper and mesquite 
two years ago delta pride a memberowned cooperative of 188 
catfish farmers in mississippi and arkansas sold virtually no fish 
in new england now it sends two tractor trailers a week to the 
boston area delivering about 60000 worth of fish at wholesale 
prices 
conagras catfish division based in isola miss declined to 
provide comparable figures but its northeast sales manager bill 
farr said sales in the sixstate region have doubled in the past 
year and are going up fast 
both companies said they have been helped by publicity about 
diseased flounder and tainted shellfish pulled from boston harbor 
and other polluted new england waters 
the thing about catfish is its raised in well water and fed 
on pellets of soybean and corn meal that are certified free of 
toxins said bill allen jr president of the catfish institute a 
trade association in belzoni miss with all the concern about 
ocean pollution the timing for catfish should be perfect 
for retailers catfish also has two other advantages a steady 
yearround supply and constant prices averaging between 4 and 5 a 
pound at retail outlets in new england said kenneth howe seafood 
sales manager for stop amp shop inc a chain of 115 supermarkets in 
massachusetts rhode island and connecticut 
when stop amp shop first began carrying catfish three years ago 
howe said there was a lot of resistance after heavy 
advertising cooking demonstrations and sales promotions sales 
picked up but they still dont rival traditional favorites like 
cod and haddock 
people like catfish howe said but this is still good old

shenanigans of television evangelists such 
as jimmy swaggart and jim bakker have spawned another player in 
americas multimilliondollar board game industry named fleece 
the flock 
the game scheduled to be in stores next month is marketed by 
regent continental a philadelphiabased company that produces board 
games for some of the nations largest toy makers including 
monopoly clue and sorry for parker brothers 
i came up with the idea when jimmy swaggart was caught in the 
motel said elizabeth fuller author of my search for the ghost 
of flight 401 and other books i thought these guys belong on 
a board game 
fleece the flock is based loosely on monopoly but 
instead of realestate tycoons players assume the roles of greedy 
evangelists 
armed with collection plates players toss dice and seek 
ownership of theme parks television stations and record companies 
while trying to bankrupt their unholy competitors and keep their own 
sexual escapades secret 
fuller who lives in weston conn collaborated on the game with 
inventor stanley mason of weston whose 30 patents include masonware 
microwave cookware and roy doty of norwalk conn a humor 
illustrator whose work has appeared in newsweek fortune and popular 
science magazines 
the three formed tongueincheek productions for this venture and 
sold the rights to market the game to regent 
the company plans to have a pilot run of 10000 games selling at 
25 retail available by april 1 said cindy levinson the regent 
account executive who is marketing fleece the flock 
the company will focus its sales campaign on the northeast at 
first but hopes to convince nationwide chains to carry the game 
she said 
fleece the flock is only the latest board game to capitalize 
on people in the news milton bradley maker of the some of the 
countrys most popular games last month unveiled trump the 
game based on the wheeling and dealing of billionaire real estate 
mogul donald trump 
analysts say any new entry into the 760 millionayear 
boardgame industry faces an uphill battle 
more than half the new toys introduced in any given year do not 
make it past that years christmas said david s leibowitz a toy 
industry analyst with american securities corp in new york the 
success of any new toy item is pretty tough 
board games tend to have a more difficult time than many other 
products because there is a set of rules to be mastered and the 
competition is far keener because many people believe they can in 
fact create a board game 
board games face additional difficulties of requiring more than 
one person and a considerable block of time to play he said 
but fuller and her collaborators say they are confident that 
americans seemingly endless fascination with the foibles of 
television evangelists will create a niche for their game 
the no 1 one thing the american public is interested in right 
now are tv evangelists gone astray not movie stars not rock 
stars fuller said 
the three spent five months testing the game on groups of 
volunteer players who were observed at masons product development 
laboratory in weston 
they went through nine versions of the board and even more 
changes in the rules which come in the form of the ten 
commandments before settling on the final version 
the inventors were dumbfounded to discover one common trait among 
the test players they all were cheating by the end of the game the 
phenomenon prompted the inclusion of one rule that is assumed in 
most games thou shalt not cheat unless thou canst get away with 
it 
no reallife evangelist is named in the game and the inventors 
insist they are not attacking religion itself fuller is a 
unitarian doty and mason are methodists 
its a comment on humanity mason said its aimed at the 
human foibles we have when well suppport people like this when we 
knowthey are evil

the federal communications commission today 
abolished regulations by which american telephone amp telegraph co 
sets longdistance rates replacing them with a formula designed to 
save consumers 900 million over four years 
however some members of congress have said the plan favored by 
atampt could lead to price increases particularly for consumers in 
rural areas 
the unanimous commission vote will replace atampts socalled 
rateofreturn regulations on july 1 with a plan that would tie 
longdistance prices to the rate of inflation 
fcc chairman dennis patrick described the commission action as 
a major milestone in telephone regulation 
he said it was time to move on from the rateofreturn process 
established for the old bell system in the 1960s under that system 
atampt was allowed to make a set profit beyond its costs which 
patrick says provided an incentive for padding costs 
we simply can no longer have a regulatory approach that was 
crafted in the 1960s to use that system in the 1990s and beyond it 
is simply outdated he said 
currently atampt can earn about 12 percent above its expenses the 
new plan willallow it to raise its rates for all customers to 3 
percent less than the rate of inflation an additional 2 percent 
reduction would be allowed for residential and small business users 
for instance if the inflation rate were 4 percent atampt could 
raise its longdistance rate 1 percent overall but residential and 
small business users would get a 1 percent decrease at that 
inflation rate 
rates would be set on three categories of atampt service 
residential and small business 800 services and all other business 
services within the residentialsmall business category prices of 
particular services such as night and weekend calling could increase 
no more than 1 percent a year 
critics of the plan note that atampts longdistance rates have 
decreased 38 percent since divestiture in 1984 due to a reduction in 
service costs they say prices will not fall as quickly under the 
new system as they would under the old one 
commissioner patricia diaz dennis said she supported this grand 
experiment of pricecap regulation but had some concern 
particularly over a provision that would limit how far atampt could 
lower its longdistance rates 
commissioner james quello also said he was concerned about that 
feature and hoped it could be eliminated soon but he described rate 
caps as a precedentsetting issue that is really going to benefit 
the public 
patrick said local telephone companies will not come under the 
rate cap plan at this point but that they would be included by july 
1 1990 he said the commission was going to accept further public 
comment on that issue and asked the local companies to submit plans 
to use rate caps by may 17 
bellsouth one of the seven regional companies created in the 
1984 breakup of atampt said the commission took an important step 
to benefit consumers in a substantial way with todays action but 
it said savings would have been greater had the commission applied 
the new rules to local companies this year instead of in 1990 
patrick said he thought he had calmed the waters in congress over 
rate caps where there has been great concern that residential 
consumers would not be wellprotected particularly rural telephone 
users 
congressional concern over rate caps which patrick first 
proposed in a speech more than two years ago caused him to postpone 
a vote on the plan in january 
rep jim cooper dtenn a member of the house 
telecommunications subcommittee introduced legislation earlier this 
month to prevent implementation of price caps until congress can 
study the proposal more thoroughly 
cooper said he wanted explicit assurances in the plan that 
uniervice in remote areas would be maintained and thast telephone 
service in remote areas would be maintained and that longdistance 
rates would not rise disproportionately in those remote areas 
rep rick boucher dva said at a hearing last month on the 
plan that the fcc should require atampt to share with customers half 
of any windfall profits arising from the plan 
patrick bowed to congressional pressure and put in limits on how 
low rates could go without such floors atampt might be able to lower 
prices enough to drive out competition the critics said 
the 3 percent rate cap would be imposed after adjustments for 
cost changes outside of atampts control such as the charges that 
local phone companies require atampt to pay to connnect with the local 
phone networks

tyson foods inc the largest poultry 
producer in the country on thursday sweetened its offer for holly 
farms by more than 60 million to total 111 billion cash 
the raised offer from 60 a share to 6350 came a few weeks 
before holly farms shareholders were scheduled to meet to consider a 
rival deal with conagra inc to acquire holly farms in a stock swap 
valued at 1 billion 
holly farms based in memphis tenn has been fighting tysons 
attempted takeover since last fall the companys board said it 
would consider tysons latest offer in due course but asked 
shareholders not to tender their shares to tyson until the board 
made a final recommendation 
tyson had earlier told hollys board that tyson was willing to 
pay 6350 a share for holly stock the latest offer tyson said 
was contingent on termination of the hollyconagra deal 
the springdalebased poultry giant already has asked a state 
court in delaware where holly farms is incorporated to nullify 
the conagraholly farms deal or to hold a hearing on the 
appropriateness of the proposal 
under the proposal conagra would be able to buy certain holly 
farms assets even if the merger failed 
don tyson chairman and chief executive officer also released a 
letter he sent to the holly farms board concerning the 6350 offer 
to holly farms shareholders 
obviously this increase should eliminate your continued and 
erroneous assertions that tyson was not and is not committed to 
acquiring all outstanding holly common shares at 6350 per share 
tyson said moreover this represents deliverable real value to 
your stockholders if instead of thwarting a decision on the 
lockups by the delaware chancery court by favoring a conagra 
transaction you would join with us in expeditiously seeking the 
courts determination 
tyson said its tender offer for holly common shares has been 
extended until march 31 the release said that as of the close of 
business wednesday tyson had received tenders of approximately 13 
million common shares of holly farms 
the target company has about 1744 million shares outstanding 
making the total value of tysons latest offer worth 111 billion

the chilean foreign minister said today after 
meeting with secretary of state james a baker iii that he is 
confident a solution can be found to the problems arising after a 
us government warning that citizens should not eat chilean fruit 
we are confident that with a joint effort we can have a 
solution the foreign minister hernan felipe errazuriz told 
reporters he described his meeting with baker as very 
constructive and said we need an urgent solution today 
baker responding to chilean anger over the us government 
warning said the action was not taken on political grounds 
it has been taken strictly as a health and safety measure and 
we think the foreign minister understands that baker said 
he added that chilean officials and those from the food and drug 
administration were discussing possible solutions but did not 
describe what options were under consideration 
a joint statement issued after the state department meeting said 
the two sides agreed to work together on an urgent basis to resolve 
the problem 
the chilean side expressed deep concern over the countrys heavy 
financial losses noting that 200000 workers and their families 
face unemployment and even destitution the statement said 
baker responded that us industry and consumers were being 
harmed as a consequence of the despicable act of those 
responsible for poisoning the fruit 
an fda spokesman said the agency weighed economic as well as 
health concerns when it decided to warn the public about the 
possible poisoning of chilean fruit an agency spokesman said 
such a decision has great economic potential to harm the 
south american country that exported 581 million in fruit worldwide 
last year and hopes to export 850 million worth next year said 
spokesman don mclearn 
on the other hand you had a probable confirmation that 
cyanide found in two red seedless grapes from chile was a 
tampering not a hoax 
then how far do you go with a decision based on that evidence 
thats very tough he said 
fda commissioner frank youngs decision was to warn consumers not 
to eat any chilean fruit which includes virtually all fresh grapes 
sold in us markets at this time of year and to urge stores to 
remove all chilean fruit from their shelves 
supermarkets reacted quickly and today produce shelves remain 
empty of chilean fruit many stores have posted signs assuring 
customers that the fruit on display didnt come from chile 
at ports in philadelphia los angeles and miami tons of chilean 
grapes pears raspberries watermelons and other noncitrus fruit 
were being held under refrigeration while tests on the produce 
continued 
no further contamination has been found the fda said 
meanwhile us officials have been meeting through the week with 
representatives of the chilean government and us fruit importers 
to develop a plan that would do the least economic damage to 
chile and assure the safety of the fruit supply mclearn said 
the fdas warning to consumers appeared to come some 24 hours 
after fda inspectors discovered two suspiciouslooking red grapes 
that tests later confirmed to contain traces of cyanide according 
to a chronology outlined by mclearn 
the chain of events began march 2 when the us embassy in 
santiago received a call from a spanishspeaking male who threatened 
to inject cyanide into chiles export fruit 
a government source speaking on the condition of anonymity has 
said the caller indicated in his threat that his motive was to 
focus attention on the lower classes of chile 
the message was passed to the us customs service which began 
detaining ships with chilean fruit at us ports 
the fda learned of the threat late in the afternoon on friday 
march 3 mclearn said the following day young called in a group of 
fda officials to talk about the situation said mclearn who 
attended the meeting that lasted into the evening 
young decided the detention by the customs service should 
continue through the weekend while he talked to officials at the 
state department and customs the chilean ambassador and fruit 
importers to try to figure out the magnitude of this and grapple 
with the decision of what to do mclearn said 
but by the end of the weekend the state department had concluded 
the threat was a hoax he said 
we felt at that point there was no reason for a full detention 
but that we would do surveillance mclearn said at that point 
we were prepared to let the fruit through and issued a release 
about the hoax 
a story about the determination that the call had been a hoax 
appeared in a santiago newspaper and on march 8 the caller we 
assume it was the same guy the fda spokesman said phoned the 
embassy again and said the threat was not a hoax 
the fda heightened its inspections at the us ports the 
spokesman said 
most of the fruit enters through the port at philadelphia and 
there the almeria star had just arrived with the next major import 
from chile he said it was on that ship that inspectors making a 
visual inspection last sunday found two discolored grapes that had 
crystalline rings around puncture marks 
the grapes were sent to an fda laboratory in philadelphia which 
made an initial finding that the grapes contained cyanide they then 
were sent to another fda lab in cincinnati which confirmed traces 
of the poison in the grapes mclearn said

spending for newspaper advertising rose 61 
percent to an estimated 312 billion in 1988 the smallest 
percentage gain in 13 years an industrybacked research 
organization said thursday 
the increase was down from a 90 percent rise in 1987 and was the 
smallest advance since a 50 percent rise in the recession year of 
1975 
the newspaper advertising bureau inc said preliminary estimates 
indicate spending for retail advertising the largest category for 
newspapers rose 40 percent to 1584 billion last year 
classified ad spending rose 101 percent to 1177 billion and 
national ad spending was up 26 percent to 359 billion 
media analysts have blamed the sluggish growth in retail ad 
spending partly on recent consolidation in the retailing business 
they said retailers also were reluctant to boost ad spending in 
the wake of the october 1987 stock market crash because of 
uncertainty earlier in the year about how the crash would affect 
consumer spending patterns 
retail ad spending grew only 17 percent in the second quarter of 
1988 for instance but picked up in the last half of the year 
rising 44 percent in the third quarter and 52 percent for the 
fourth quarter 
overall ad spending in newspapers was up 66 percent in the 
fourth quarter

what brokers called renewed worries about slower growth and 
inflationary pressures

grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed in 
light quiet trading thursday on the chicago board of trade 
traders said tenders that may have gone unbought were responsible 
for early downside moves by both the grains and beans and may have 
set the tone in the absence of any fresh news the rest of the day 
pakistan apparently canceled overnight on a 99000ton purchase 
of soy oil and that spread pressure across the bean market but 
expectations the pakistanis might return to the market and light 
cash sales of beans around the country provide some underpinning 
through the rest of the day 
traders expected wheat to move upward after a oneday tour of the 
kansas fields concluded recent dry weather had harmed the winter 
wheat crop but dampening any upside move was a rumor that china 
will cancel a 270000ton buy of newcrop wheat 
on the close wheat was cent lower to 1 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in march at 437 a bushel corn was cent 
lower to cents higher with march at 278 a bushel oats were 
to 1 cents higher with march at 208 a bushel and soybeans were

the navy on thursday suspended three units of 
unisys corp from bidding on or receiving federal contracts in the 
latest action stemming from an investigation of alleged defense 
contract fraud 
the navy said it was suspending the bidding rights of the 
shipboard and ground systems group the computer systems division 
and the communications systems division of unisys to protect the 
governments interests 
unisys is a computer giant created by the 1986 merger of sperry 
corp and burroughs corp all three units suspended thursday were 
once part of sperry 
according to latest statistics unisys is the nations 15th 
largest defense contractor having received 14 billion in work in 
fiscal 1988 the navys suspension however applies to any contract 
with a federal agency and not just military contracts 
pentagon and navy officials were unable to say immediately how 
much business the three divisions did with the federal government 
peter hynes a unisys spokesman in blue bell pa said thursday 
the three suspended units performed about 16 billion worth of 
federal government work last year unisys as a whole is a 99 
billion corporation he said he added that the suspensions wont 
affect the companys commercial computer sales to the government or 
industry because those are handled by other units 
hynes added unisys was confident that by working with the navy 
to confirm compliance to rules and by making any additional changes 
if appropriate the suspension can be removed rapidly 
the suspension came less than a week after a former unisys vice 
president and former unisys consultant pleaded guilty in federal 
court in alexandria va to trying to bribe former navy officials 
another unisys executive and a second unisys consultant entered 
guilty pleas on jan 27 to making illegal campaign contributions to 
members of congress 
the pleas were part of the federal governments 2year 
investigation into the pentagons 150billionayear procurement 
practices the probe is codenamed operation ill wind 
the probe includes allegations that private consultants hired by 
defense contractors bribed pentagon officials to obtain inside 
information that gave companies an edge in securing contracts 
citing the guilty pleas and a confidential investigative report 
prepared by unisys the navy said thursday the suspensions were 
justified by the egregious nature of the misconduct 
the misconduct involves expense account abuses improper use of 
consultants for lobbying purposes improper corporate campaign 
contributions and bribery of government officials it said 
the service as usual in the case in such disciplinary moves 
gave no indication how long the suspensions might last it did say 
however the management of unisys had been vigorous in investigating 
the allegations and in putting in place a new management program 
to guard against such abuses in the future 
notwithstanding the actions on the part of unisys in light of 
the number of instances of misconduct at former sperry divisions 
the egregious nature of the misconduct and the fact that new 
instances of wrongdoing pertaining to the ongoing ill wind 
investigation continue to surface the navy has determined that the 
former sperry divisions need to be suspended to protect the 
governments interests the service said 
evidence that the policies and procedures of unisys are 
understood and followed by these divisions is necessary and unisys 
must perform some additional internal audits across the affected 
divisions to verify that the types of improper conduct in evidence 
are not pervasive elsewhere within the company it said

spring break has arrived and college kids are 
rolling out the barrels 
but anheuserbusch cos inc parent of the worlds largest 
brewery is urging restraint the company spends millions of dollars 
each year promoting what it calls responsibledrinking programs 
some are considered particularly relevant this time of the year 
when students descend upon resort cities from miami to palm springs 
and indulge in brewguzzling marathons that arent particularly 
welcomed by the locals 
entertainer sonny bono mayor of palm springs for the past 10 
months said his citys residents have long tried to curb the level 
of alcohol consumption during spring break 
a couple of the events are cruising and drinking and getting 
out of hand bono said for the locals its a time we dread 
enter anheuserbusch which tries to get its message across 
before the students hit town on campuses across the country 
college newspapers advertise pit stops where students en route 
to spring break destinations can pull over and get a doughnut and a 
cup of coffee 
here its someone selling alcohol and saying dont abuse it 
and dont get carried away bono said i like it 
the st louisbased brewing giant says it is committed to keeping 
customers from over indulging the number of responsibledrinking 
programs sponsored by the company nearly equals the number of its 
brands 
choices include budweiser bud light busch natural light 
michelob michelob dry and la to keep thirsty drinkers in line 
the company offers programs such as the your alcohol iq videotape 
know when to say when the buddy system good sport tips im 
driving and alert cab 
anheuserbusch sold 785 million barrels of beer last year 411 
percent of the total brewing industry sales nationwide but for more 
than a decade the brewery hasnt been content to simply sell beer 
in record quantities 
according to a recent fortune magazine survey anheuserbusch 
ranks first among beverage companies in responsibility to the 
community and environment 
i dont know if social conscience is the right word said 
stephen k lambright vice president and group executive at 
anheuserbusch who oversees the companys responsibledrinking 
programs its a social commitment we hope to be part of the 
solution hopefully what were doing is something thats more than 
just a pr piece 
at first glance anheuserbuschs sobriety theme in the spring 
break pilgrimage south by winterweary college kids might have the 
unwanted side effect of forfeiting part of this lucrative market 
but it appears far more successful than the sophomoric partying 
theme by rival miller brewing co 
miller recently scrapped what it now concedes was a poortaste ad 
campaign for springbreak getaways after college students complained 
it was sexist and they threatened to boycott miller products the 
brewers supplements in college newspapers last month featured 
pictures of bikini clad coeds clutching miller bottles and tips for 
men on sure fire ways to scam babes 
anheuserbusch doesnt have anything as easy as a barrel count to 
determine the success of its responsible drinking program 
lambright however pointed out that the number of underaged beer 
drinkers and fatalities in alcoholrelated accidents both have 
decreased in recent years 
we certainly dont have all of the answers but the statistics 
are all moving in the right direction lambright said the 
system is getting better 
among the companys programs and advertisements touting them 
at sports events messages from professional athletes are 
beamed on the big screen and billboards remind the fans to be a 
good sport and not over indulge 
at local video stores la law stars jill eikenberry and 
michael tucker are featured in the brewerys newest program your 
alcohol iq anheuserbusch distributed 25000 free copies to video 
outlets nationwide 
and who hasnt seen spuds mackenzie and the spudettes advising 
television watchers to moderate their alcohol intake 
the concept of a beer company advising restraint in the 
consumption of its products isnt all that new anymore 
anheuserbusch says its first programs began in the late 1970s 
but the brewery didnt go highprofile until 1985 when its first 
advertisement for responsible drinking aired role models such as 
sports stars steve garvey and patrick ewing were hired to tell the 
public to know when to say when a program that provides 
guidelines for bartenders waiters and waitresses 
they werent beer commercials by any means lambright said 
prior to that most of what you saw were thirdparty efforts in 
the publicservice announcement mode as opposed to a company 
actually paying for regular price commercial time to run a nonbeer 
commercial responsibility piece 
collectively anheuserbuschs strategy for fighting alcohol 
abuse is operation alert an acronym for action and leadership 
through education responsibility and training the array of 
programs designed as aids for the estimated 80 million beer drinkers 
in the united states runs the gamut 
theres tips which stands for training for intervention 
procedures by servers of alcohol an instruction manual to teach 
retailers how to recognize and avoid troublesome situations 
involving alcohol and good sport a campaign aimed at combatting 
rowdyism in stadiums and arenas 
the buddy system is designed for use with collegeage audiences 
it recommends holding parties with a dry last hour and establishing 
a network of friends to serve as designated drivers 
alert cab a program in 140 cities provides a free taxicab ride 
home for customers in bars and restaurants who are faced with 
possible drunk driving situations im driving is another 
designateddriver program 
anheuserbusch also is a major sponsor of sadd students against 
drunk driving and has published pamphlets dealing with the effects 
of alcohol consumption on motorcycle and boating safety

national semiconductor corp which 
has shed one division agreed to sell another and laid off 2000 
workers to stem losses announced thursday it lost 81 million from 
continuing operations in its most recent quarter 
charles e sporck president and chief executive officer said 
the companys chip business was hurt by a decline in bookings in 
late 1988 caused by a buildup of customers inventory a slowdown in 
computer sales and seasonal factors 
he said he expects improvement in the current quarter following a 
restructuring of the chip division cutbacks in the worldwide 
workforce and reduced spending 
the chipmakers losses for the first nine months of its fiscal 
year through february 26 reached 1168 million from continuing 
operations compared with a 346 million gain during the same 
period a year earlier in the third quarter last year the company 
had a gain of 134 million from continuing operations 
net losses of 446 million in the quarter and 1003 million in 
the ninemonth period were cushioned by a 451 million gain from 
the sale of nationals datachecker systems inc that division 
though lost 88 million in the quarter and 286 million in the 
first three quarters 
net sales were 589 million for the quarter up from 572 million 
a year earlier for the first nine months this year sales were 18 
billion up from 16 billion a year earlier 
the size of the loss doesnt shock me but it was larger than i 
anticipated said jim hammons a computer industry analyst with 
the sierra group in tempe ariz i dont know that its going to 
hurt them any more on wall street nobody expected them to do very 
well this quarter 
national semiconductors chances of recovering much in the fourth 
quarter are slim hammons said and would depend on how well they 
market products and use the cash from their recent sales of 
divisions 
they have some new products coming out that could help them 
but i dont think theyll be ready to help in this quarter he 
said 
on feb 27 national semiconductor announced it had agreed to 
sell its national advanced systems for 398 million to hitachi ltd 
of japan and electronic data systems a unit of general motors corp 
national semiconductor expects to close the sale during the current 
quarter 
national advanced systems is hitachis largest distributor of 
mainframe computers that run the same programs as international 
business machines corps big mainframes it has 2200 employees 
worldwide including 1200 in the united states 
after that sale national semiconductor would be pared down to 
about 35000 worldwide the company announced 2000 layoffs earlier

some rivals of striketorn eastern airlines have 
raised fares on competitive routes since the 13dayold walkout 
began moves they say stem from higher demand but that one consumer 
group complains is price gouging 
some competitors said thursday that their recent fare hikes were 
unrelated to the eastern strike which has grounded most of the 
airlines flights 
the walkout by machinists has been supported by most of the 
pilots and flight attendants at eastern which sought bankruptcy 
protection from its creditors about a week ago 
all the airlines are heading into the peak spring travel period 
combining spring break and the easter and passover holidays 
eastern archrival delta air lines says it hasnt raised fares but 
has tightened fare restrictions as a result of the eastern debacle 
on flights from cities in the northeast to florida where it 
competes with eastern delta has boosted its cancellation penalty on 
discount fares to 100 percent from 25 percent delta took the action 
because the eastern strike had led many passengers to book on 
multiple carriers including delta creating no shows for those 
airlines said delta spokeswoman jackie pate 
in addition she said delta has reduced the number of cutrate 
fares available on certain flights to protect business 
travelers the spillover from the eastern walkout meant that 
discountfare passengers were displacing fullfare business fliers 
on delta flights ms pate said 
other eastern competitors notably trans world airlines inc and 
usair group inc confirmed they recently raised fares on some 
routes they share with eastern 
those moves were called opportunistic and gouging by dan 
smith consumer affairs director of the international airline 
passengers association in dallas 
smith said he was skeptical about the insistence by twa and usair 
that their fare boosts were unrelated to the strike and were not an 
attempt to capitalize on easterns woes 
you would hope they would be more sensitive during these 
unusual circumstances smith said 
the possible disappearance of eastern from the skies likely would 
reduce the number of discounted fares available to passengers he 
said 
spokesmen for united airlines american airlines and pan am 
corp which also compete with eastern on some routes said those 
carriers had not raised fares since the eastern walkout started 
march 4 
twa plans to increase its discount fares between new york and san 
juan puerto rico starting march 23 in order to bring them closer 
to twas florida fares which are sharply higher said twa spokesman 
bob blattner in st louis mo 
he called the timing of the move a coincidence 
the roundtrip discount fares between new york and san juan will 
be raised from 239259 to 259289 twas discount new yorkmiami 
fares which havent been increased range from 258 to 298 
usair spokesman david shipley said that carrier has not raised 
any fares as a result of the eastern strike 
rather he said usairs recent increases were an extension of a 
move begun last november the latest hikes include a rise in the 
regular oneway fare between boston and tampa fla to 329 from 
319 also effective march 23 
the bostontampa route competes directly with eastern shipley 
declined to give examples of other new fare increases applied to 
noncompeting routes 
these people are businessmen and theyve seen an opportunity to 
raise fares said andrew geller an airline analyst at provident 
national bank in philadelphia 
some members of congress and others have argued that a demise of 
eastern could seriously reduce competition in the nations airline 
industry whose ranks have been thinned by deregulation they have 
warned the reduced competition could lead to higher fares defeating 
the intended main purpose of deregulation to make it affordable 
for more americans to fly

the federal communications commission on 
thursday abolished twodecadesold price regulations on american 
telephone amp telegraph cos longdistance services saying consumers 
should reap 900 million in savings under a new pricing plan over 
the next four years 
one consumer group however said the plan could lead to the 
first increases in longdistance rates particularly on nights and 
weekends since the 1984 breakup of atampt 
the 30 commission decision which fcc chairman dennis patrick 
called a milestone in federal telephone regulation will replace 
atampts socalled rateofreturn rules on july 1 with a plan that 
would tie longdistance prices to productivity gains and the rate of 
inflation 
the vote postponed in january under pressure from congress 
followed more than two years of rancorous debate between patrick and 
critics on capitol hill and consumer groups who said the new plan 
may slow the 4yearold decline in longdistance rates 
but patrick said it was time to change the 1960sera system under 
which atampt was allowed to make a set profit beyond its costs 
patrick said that system gave atampt incentive to pad expenses 
we simply can no longer have a regulatory approach that was 
crafted in the 1960s and to use that system in the 1990s and beyond 
it is simply outdated he said 
atampt said the decision was a step forward for atampt and good 
news for our customers 
patrick made a number of revisions to the plan to assuage 
congressional concerns including additional safeguards for 
residential and smallbusiness users 
one of patricks critics was rep edward j markey dmass 
chairman of the house energy and commerce subcommittee on 
telecommunications and finance 
markey said the plan still does not contain sufficient consumer 
safeguards to ensure that residential telephone customers will 
fairly share in rate reductions which should result from new 
telephone technologies i fear that the days of real longdistance 
price reductions for the average residential caller may be over 
markey said he will cosponsor legislation requiring the fcc to 
provide price and cost data with which congress can measure the 
effect of price caps on consumers and atampts competitors 
currently atampt can earn about 12 percent on its investment 
under the new plan overall rates must rise 3 percentage points less 
than the rate of inflation for example a 1 percent increase if 
the rate of inflation were 4 percent 
rates would be set on three broad categories of atampt service 
residential and small business 800 services and all other business 
services 
to make sure big business does not get all the benefit of rate 
cuts rates for residential and smallbusiness prices must rise at 
least 2 percentage points less than the rate of inflation the fcc 
said 
within the residentialsmall business category prices of 
particular services such as night and weekend calling could increase 
no more than 4 percentage points above the overall percentage change 
in rates for example if inflation was 4 percent and overall rates 
rose 1 percent night and weekend calls could rise 5 percent 
gene kimmelman executive director of the consumer federation of 
america said atampt has lowered longdistance rates faster under 
rateofreturn regulation and that the new plan is hardly an 
improvement for the public since longdistance rates conceivably 
could go up in some categories 
it will possibly give you the first real longdistance 
increases since the breakup of atampt kimmelman said 
the plan also limits how much atampt can lower its rates which 
commissioners james quello and patricia diaz dennis said caused them 
concern but dennis said she supported this grand experiment of 
pricecap regulation 
quello said he reluctantly supported the limits or floors on 
how much prices can go down and that he hoped such restraints could 
be removed quickly but he said the plan overall was a 
precedentsetting issue that is really going to benefit the 
public 
atampt said it was mystified that the commission finds it 
necessary to continue treating atampt differently by limiting our 
ability to reduce prices in such an extremely competitive market 
patrick said local telephone companies will be placed under some 
kind of rate cap plan on july 1 1990 the commission ordered local 
companies to submit pricing plans in that regard by may 17 
although state utilities commissions regulate phone companies 
local rates the fcc regulates how much the companies charge 
longdistance carriers to plug into their local networks those 
access charges account for a big part of longdistance costs 
bellsouth one of the seven regional companies created in the 
1984 breakup of atampt said the commission took an important step 
to benefit consumers in a substantial way but that savings would 
have been greater had the commission applied the new rules to local 
companies this year 
mci communications corp one of atampts chief competitors in the 
longdistance market said it supported the price cap plan for 
longdistance carriers but said local phone companies should still 
be strictly regulated because they have monopolies on local service 
but united states telephone association president john sodolski 
said for the full benefit of price caps to be realized local 
exchange carriers must be free to employ it as well 
rep jim cooper dtenn introduced legislation earlier this 
month to prevent implementation of price caps until congress can 
study the proposal more thoroughly 
cooper said he wanted explicit assurances in the plan that 
universal telephone service and subsidies for highcost telephone 
service in remote areas would be maintained and that longdistance 
rates would not rise disproportionately in those remote areas

the poisoning of grapes from chile poses a 
highprofile threat to a business that has grown to 900 million a 
year by using southern hemisphere farmers to put fruit on american 
tables all winter 
american importers and chilean farmers worry that if the cyanide 
sabotage case isnt solved soon they could lose the market for the 
25 percent of their crop still on trees or aboard usbound ships 
the tampering which prompted the food and drug administration to 
recommend pulling grapes nectarines pears and other chilean winter 
fruit from market shelves also might give the business a permanent 
public relations black eye one big importer said 
i think its a major major overreactionan entire industry 
is being destroyed los angeles importer rick eastes said tuesday 
eastes manager for the david oppenheimercalifornia import firm 
munched a couple of red flame seedless grapes from chile for 
reporters tuesday to underscore his anger over the fdas nosell 
recommendation 
the fda advised grocers to pull chilean fruit from the shelves 
tuesday after tests in philadelphia found cyanide at far below 
harmful levels had apparently been put in two clusters of grapes 
virtually all the socalled summer fruit on american grocery 
shelves this time of year is from chile whose farmers have learned 
to exploit the southern hemisphere growing season that is a mirror 
image of that in the north 
from a trickle of grape imports in the 1950s the business has 
grown to projected shipments this year with a retail value of 900 
million said caryl saunders a san francisco spokeswoman for the 
industry 
in 1979 when imports were starting to gain momentum the retail 
value of chilean grapes and stone fruit was 72 million said ms 
saunders by 1988 that had climbed to 600 million 
more than 100 ships full of chilean fruit are expected to land 
this year to be distributed nationwide from the ports of 
philadelphia long beach calif and tampa and cape canaveral in 
florida 
the business is organized by the growers under the banner of the 
chilean winter fruit association and the importers called the 
american produce association 
that loose alliance carefully orchestrates the traffic to avoid 
ruffling the feathers of american farmers 
grapes which make up threequarters of the shipments are 
carefully withheld until the last california emperor grapes clear 
the supermarkets usually sometime in december grape shipments are 
cut off earlier than would be decreed by nature in late april 
when the first california grapes make their way to market 
there is little overlap in growing season for nectarines and 
other fruit so there is less potential for conflict with american 
growers ms saunders said 
importers and growers are anxious for the fda to declare the 
fruit safe because products already on us shores is will 
deteriorate beyond salvation in a week or two ms saunders said 
additionally an estimated 25 percent of the crop remains on the 
trees and vines of chiles farms or on ships headed north 
importer eastes called the fdas advice to quit selling chilean 
fruit unnecessary and maintained that testing here and new security 
measures imposed at packing houses in chile adequately protect 
american consumers he suggested the agency was trying to burnish an 
image tarnished in the public mind by the current furor over alar a 
possibly carcinogenic chemical sprayed on a fraction of the us 
apple crop 
fruits imported from chile include grapes nectarines peaches 
plums apricots pears granny smith apples cherries raspberries 
blueberries cantaloupe and honeydew melons

a savings and loan trade association on 
wednesday canceled its annual convention in hawaii this year thus 
avoiding television images of sampl executives lolling on palmfringed 
beaches at a time when the industry is asking for the biggest 
taxpayer bailout in us history 
it would not be appropriate for us to hold a convention in 
hawaii at a time when congress and the administration are working to 
find a solution to this terrible crisis facing taxpayers bud 
koch chairman of the national council of savings institutions said 
in a statement 
the council the smaller of two main trade groups representing 
sampls is taking a lesson from its larger rival the us league of 
savings institutions 
the league held its convention in november at a luxury hotel on 
waikiki beach in honolulu it said it went ahead with the meeting 
because it had been planned years in advance and would have been 
costly to cancel at the last minute nevertheless the group endured 
criticism after television news reports showed executives on the 
beach and attending a lavish luau 
the council said would it would suffer substantial financial 
costs by canceling its meeting which had been scheduled for may 
on the island of kauai but koch said thrifts who are members of 
the national council have concluded that it would be wrong to 
conduct business as usual 
president bushs plan for bailing out the savings and loan 
deposit insurance fund would spend about 150 billion over the next 
10 years most analysts say at least half of that would come from 
taxpayers that exceeds the combined costs of the marshall plan aid 
to europe after world war ii and the bailouts of the chrysler corp 
new york city and lockheed corp 
koch said the council may schedule a special meeting in 
washington in may to elect officers and take care of other business 
normally conducted at the annual convention 
in another development one of three members of the federal home 
loan bank board the agency regulating sampls announced his 
resignation effective aug 18 lawrence white appointed to the 
board on nov 12 1986 is returning to teach at new york 
universitys school of business 
under the presidents proposed sampl plan the bank board would be 
reduced to a single chairman who would report to the treasury

the us industrial operating rate eased last 
month for the first time since september the government said 
thursday in a report welcomed by those worried that strains on the 
economy are pushing up prices 
us factories mines and utilities operated at 843 percent of 
capacity in february down 02 percentage point from january when 
the 845 percent rate was the highest in nearly a decade the 
federal reserve board reported 
at the same time the pace of industrial production held steady 
in february after 12 months of steady advances the central bank 
said in a second report thursday 
federal reserve vice chairman manuel johnson told reporters the 
figures are consistent with the notion of some moderation in the 
economy although it would be premature to say they signal a trend 
on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks 
rose 2017 points traders took the reports as evidence that 
inflationary pressures in the economy were easing but analysts were 
cautious about reading too much into one months figures 
the markets can take some comfort that the edge is coming off 
the burst of momentum through the end of the year in the economy 
said economist allen sinai of the boston co 
but he continued there is no suggestion that the softness 
spells recession or even major slowdown at this time nor that it 
will flow through and arrest the upward momentum of inflation 
the closer factories get to full capacity the greater the fear 
they will have trouble producing enough goods to meet demand 
leading to shortages and price increases 
just wednesday the federal reserve reported that while expansion 
and improved efficiency are forestalling widespread bottlenecks 
materials and product prices are edging up albeit sporadically and 
at an uneven pace 
concern about inflation heightened last month after the labor 
department reported that consumer prices rose 06 percent in january 
while wholesale prices shot up 1 percent that prompted the fed to 
intensify its yearlong campaign to push up interest rates in an 
effort to slow economic growth and thus restrain inflation 
economist james annable of the first national bank of chicago 
said that while the fed can breath a sigh of relief at 
februarys industrial production and capacity use reports there are 
other more convincing indications that the economy continues to 
expand at a moderately strong pace 
what weve got in this economy is continued movement forward 
annable said the news for financial markets is good but in fact 
it certainly doesnt mean that the federal reserve is going to ease 
off 
last months operating rate of 843 percent was up from 824 
percent a year earlier at manufacturing plants the operating rate 
dipped 02 percentage point to 846 percent 
use of capacity for production of durable goods big ticket 
items expected to last three or more years stood at 834 percent 
down from 835 percent in january the rate for nondurable goods 
was 863 percent in february down from 867 percent in january 
the rate at motor vehicle and parts plants was down 12 
percentage points to 849 percent last month it was the second 
straight monthly decrease after steady advances from august to 
december 
the auto industry has been plagued by slow sales so far this 
year as higher interest rates and declining demand set in 
the operating rate at utilities rebounded to 829 percent in 
february up 14 percentage point from january when activity was 
depressed by relatively warm weather 
in the mining sector which includes oil and gas drilling the 
operating rate also fell 14 percentage point to 811 percent in 
february as coal production continued to fall from its high level 
at the end of last year 
production meanwhile held steady in the manufacturing sector in 
february after a 07 percent gain in january 
automobiles were assembled at an annual rate of 72 million units 
last month down from the 75 million pace of january 
output at mines and oil wells dropped 18 percent in february 
after falling 19 percent in january production at utilities rose 
19 percent after dropping 05 percent during the unusually mild 
temperatures of january

the two broadest measures of the nations money 
supply rose in the week ended march 6 the federal reserve board 
reported thursday

adjusted 30842 billion from a revised 30765 billion the 
previous week 
an even broader measure m3 rose to a seasonally adjusted

in judging monetary policy the fed has indicated it is 
monitoring the value of the dollar commodity prices and the 
difference between short and longterm interest rates it also has 
shifted attention from m1 to the two broader money supply measures 
the fed in february reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of 3 
percent to 7 percent growth in m2 and 35 percent to 75 percent 
growth in m3 the fed has not set a target for m1 growth since early 
1987 
for the latest 13 weeks m2 averaged 30694 billion a 30

longstruggling maxicare health plans inc 
filed a federal bankruptcy petition thursday but promised to keep 
serving the 1 million americans covered by its plans in a dozen 
states 
the company which operates health maintenance organizations 
under the names maxicare healthcare usa and healthamerica 
announced it sought protection from creditors under chapter 11 of 
the us bankruptcy code 
maxicare promised to keep serving patients and to continue 
paying doctors and hospitals the filing made in us district 
court in santa ana gives the company a reprieve from creditors and 
allows it to continue operating under court supervision while 
seeking to reorganize 
included in the filing are the los angelesbased parent company 
and operations in alabama arizona california illinois indiana 
louisiana north carolina ohio pennsylvania south carolina texas 
and washington 
excluded is the companys wisconsin hmo 
maxicare once the nations biggest private hmo has been losing 
money for two years and in recent months has cut membership from 
23 million to 1 million by selling several health plans in 14 
states in announcing the bankruptcy peter ratican chairman and 
chief executive officer revealed the company was negotiating sale 
of its california plan previously said to be part of the solid 
core the company intended to retain 
ratican said in a news release the company filed for bankruptcy 
because it couldnt pay its bills 
these actions enable us to protect our operations while gaining 
the time to finalize and implement a plan for reorganization 
ratican said we acted in the face of increasing demands by 
creditors and our inability at this time to obtain additional 
financing 
maxicares stock which sold for as much as 28 a share in the 
companys boom years a decade ago closed at 1875 cents a share 
thursday down 50 cents from wednesdays close 
maxicare saddled with debt hit along with the rest of the hmo 
business with soaring medical costs and struggling to overcome the 
effects of an ambitious expansion drive has logged losses in eight 
straight quarters 
in the first nine months of 1988 the company lost 2505 
million final 1988 results havent been reported 
debt as of december included 150 million in bank loans and 295 
million in bonds 
maxicares health plans are structured in the form of health 
maintenance organizations under which customers generally enrolled 
through their employers are entitled to visit designated doctors 
generally for a small fee 
doctors are paid on a set monthly budget rather than being 
reimbursed for specific services the intent is to cut the overall 
cost of medical care by encouraging people to get regular checkups 
and preventive treatment rather than waiting to seek treatment 
until a medical crisis strikes 
maxicare doesnt own hospitals or clinics as do some hmos so 
its assets consist primarily of a management team and good will 
or its image with customers 
founded in 1973 by the husbandandwife team of chairman fred 
wasserman and president pamela anderson maxicare grew quickly 
capitalizing on the industrys belief that hmos were the wave of the 
future easily raising money through stock sale and loans the 
company grew into a national health plan 
by the mid1980s hmos were under pressure from rising medical 
costs but maxicare bit off a big chunk of new business in 1986 by 
buying two ailing competitors healthcare usa and healthamerica 
the strain of trying to digest the acquisitions was compounded by 
managements inability to keep costs and the number of doctor visits 
down said analyst steven reid who follows the company for the lh 
friend amp co inc investment firm in los angeles 
founder wasserman and ms anderson were ousted in august 1988 and 
replaced with ratican an outside director with a background in the 
entertainment business most recently as president of ailing de 
laurentiis entertainment group inc which now is in chapter 11 
but he has so far been unable to reverse the slide 
reid said ratican by reassuring investors the firm could work 
its way out of the hole has done plan members a disservice 
youve got a situation where a layman has an opportunity to 
switch plans and he reads in the paper this companys in good 
shape he continues his enrollment reid said 
the bankruptcy filing comes at a critical time for the companys 
hopes at resurrection because workers generally are given the 
opportunity to switch medical plans each june reid noted competing 
medical plans already have started marketing themselves among 
employees and the filing is likely to both distract maxicares 
management from that marketing effort

the markets of china the worlds most populous nation 
on other markets energy futures were mixed to marginally higher 
after three straight sessions of strong rallies gold and silver 
futures dipped but platinum rose and livestock and pork futures 
edged lower 
sugar settled 10 cents to 51 cents higher on the new york coffee 
sugar and cocoa exchange with the contract for delivery in may at 
1259 cents a pound 
buying began with a rumor that the chinese had bought between 
150000 and 500000 tons of raw sugar from thailand though many 
traders cast doubts that the shipment exceeded 350000 tons 
many others traders said they believed the chinese actually 
bought the sugar last fall from cuba and learning the soviets had 
made a similarsized purchase from thailand simply swapped 
shipments to take advantage of economies in delivery of the sugar 
also fueling the market was talk the brazilians had sold 100000 
tons and that argentina was in the market for a large shipment 
the climbing prices triggered a string of technical buystops 
decisions made by pricechart considerations and the market broke 
a quadruple top at 1238 cents and continued rising

problems with production facilities in norway and qatar had fueled 
previous rallies 
gold and silver continued sliding in the face of a firm dollar 
and uncertainty about whether higher inflation is in the offing 
platinum got a boost from apparent tradehouse buying prompted 
either by ideas the market was oversold or by recent sales by the 
japanese 
gold settled 230 to 290 lower at the new york commodity 
exchange with march at 38980 a troy ounce silver slipped 32 
cents to 47 cents with march at 6059 a troy ounce platinum was

a highlevel chilean delegation called thursday 
for swift action to avoid further economic and social turmoil in 
chile resulting from the suspension on us sales of chilean fruit 
over an apparent cyanide poisoning attempt 
meanwhile us officials were meeting with representatives of 
the chilean government and its fruit growers trying to find a way 
to release for sale the tons of chilean fruit detained at american 
docks without compromising public safety 
the chilean call was disclosed in a joint communique issued after 
secretary of state james a baker iii met with the chilean foreign 
affairs and agriculture ministers 
as chilean fruit continued to pile up at airports and docks and 
the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of chileans were 
threatened the us food and drug administration said a small team 
of fda inspectors will be sent to chile on saturday to check 
security on chilean fruit 
the state department meeting came four days after the fda warned 
americans to avoid chilean fruit because traces of cynadide were 
found in chilean fruit shipped to philadelphia 
there was no sign of an imminent end to the crisis despite the 
highlevel attention it was receiving 
the fda said technical meetings were continuing to determine what 
levels of inspections might be feasible for fruit at american docks 
a government source who spoke on the condition of anonymity said 
there had been discussion of inspections of 8 percent to 10 percent 
of the fruit on the docks now and in the future and release the 
produce if no contamination is found however it doesnt appear 
to be feasible to do that high a level now 
for the future chilean officials are proposing to inspect 
visually about 4 percent to 5 percent of their fruit before it is 
shipped for export the source said 
were getting reasonably close on that chiles end of things 
on something that might be acceptable but the problem of what to do 
with whats on the ships and in warehouses is still up in the air 
the source said 
the fruit thats been removed from store shelves is such a 
different problem they may just end up with no solution to that 
except to dump it the source said 
the washington post reported that the chilean exporters 
association estimates about 20 million worth of fruit is detained 
under refrigeration at docks and airports in the united states 
about 4 million worth is to arrive in the next few days by ship 
and 15 million worth is ready to be shipped from chile 
inspectors at ports in philadelphia los angeles and miami have 
examined 6859 cases of grapes and nearly nearly 4000 cases of 
other fruits honeydew melons nectarines apples raspberries 
pears cantalopes plums peaches seedless watermelon juan canary 
melons and blackberries 
the joint communique issued at the state department stressed the 
determination of both sides to reach a solution 
chilean foreign minister hernan felipe errazuriz told reporters 
after the meeting that he is confident a solution will be found and 
described the encounter as very constructive 
baker responding to chilean anger over a us government warning 
that citizens not eat chilean fruit said the action was taken 
strictly as a health and safety measure 
we think the foreign minister understands that he said 
in miami robert aders the president of the food marketing 
institute said the entire food industry will be hurt by the 
discovery of cyanide in chilean produce and cancercausing chemicals 
in apples 
the loss will probably be felt throughout the system he said 
chilean produce continues to arrive in the united states and 
aders noted one shipment reached miami wednesday night 
the indication is theyre not going to let it be sold he 
said 
aders predicted surveillance of imported fruit will increase 
saying i expect that therell be a lot more activity at the dock 
including vigilance at the point of shipment 
but security will continue to be a problem the whole food 
system is based on the integrity of the people in it he said 
suddenly its an attractive place for criminals to go to express a 
grievance

three former sundstrand corp executives were 
charged thursday with conspiring to defraud the federal government 
five months after the defense contractor agreed to plead guilty to 
fraud and pay a 115 million fine

that the federal government will not waver from employing the 
resources necessary to protect the integrity of the defense 
procurement process 
the indictments are part of an ongoing threeyear investigation 
of the rockfordbased defense contractor 
sundstrand pleaded guilty in october to fraud charges in a 
fourcount criminal information the 115 million fine was the 
largest fraud settlement in defense department history 
the aerospace manufacturer allegedly overbilled the government 
for aircraft parts underbid actual costs on other contracts and 
attempted to recover through overhead accounts set up for other 
purposes and submitted claims for such things as babysitting 
expenses and country club memberships 
sundstrand spokesman claude vernam said the company was not 
involved in thursdays indictments he declined further comment 
the three men were identified as joseph mccarthy 53 of 
rockford a former division controller ray john chapel jr 46 of 
reston va a former division pricing manager and ralph hamann 
63 of rockford a former pricing group supervisor 
they were charged with one count each of conspiring to defraud 
and scheming to conceal mccarthy was charged with two counts of 
making false statements and chapel and hamann with four counts of 
the same offense 
mccarthy faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and 1 
million in fines chapel and hamann face 30year terms and 15 
million in fines if convicted 
assistant us attorney william clabault did not say what role 
the three allegedly played in the fraud scheme involving sundstrand 
he declined to say whether the men acted on company orders or have 
agreed to cooperate 
after the settlement was approved last fall sundstrand was 
suspended from bidding on or receiving government contracts until a 
grand jury concluded its probe 
on jan 26 sundstrand agreed to repay an additional 623 
million to the pentagon and make costsaving concessions on future 
contracts one defense official estimated could be worth another 34 
million
