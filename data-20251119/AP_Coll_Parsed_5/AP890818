thousands of britons for whom life without private 
eye is unthinkable are digging into their pockets to rescue the 
magazine from being bankrupted by a massive libel bill 
the response to the 1 million award against private eye has 
triggered an extraordinary display of reader loyalty contributions 
totaled 80000 by early august according to editor ian hislop 
on may 24 a jury ordered private eye to pay the record sum to 
sonia sutcliffe the estranged wife of mass murderer peter 
sutcliffe the socalled yorkshire ripper for two articles 
alleging that she tried to sell her story to newspapers the 
magazine also was ordered to pay court costs of 160000 
the award caused outcry partly because it far outweighed the 
damages paid by the state to families of sutcliffes 13 victims 
editor hislop 29 said if this is justice then im a banana 
i think this is very nearly the end of private eye we cannot 
possibly pay that amount of damages 
he then launched an appeal hoping to get 5 from each of the 
magazines 210000 readers 
private eyes reader loyalty may seem unusual but then so is 
private eye its semimonthly serving of news gossip opinion and 
satire has kept it afloat with barely a change of format since its 
birth in 1961 at the dawn of swinging sixties london 
with its carefully cultivated air of shabbiness it still looks 
like something pasted together in a college basement which keeps 
the street price low at 95 cents a copy its 32 pages carry little 
advertising and it shows no political bias savaging hypocrisy 
pomposity and wrongdoing wherever they appear 
while other magazines poke fun at contemporary mores private 
eye pokes fun at real people said tony loynes publisher and 
editor of the industry magazine uk press gazette 
their satire bites at the rich the famous the makers and the 
shakers its wickedly satirical even dangerously satirical 
some private eye euphemisms designed to avoid libel problems 
have entered the language such as tired and emotional for 
drunk lately it has been prominent in investigating the 
controversial shooting deaths of three irish terrorism suspects in 
gibraltar last year and the procedures that caused a british ferry 
to capsize off belgium in 1987 with 193 lives lost 
street of shame reports dark secrets from londons newsrooms 
heir of sorrows chronicles prince charles marriage as a tawdry 
romantic serial book reviews invariably debunk the literary darling 
of the day 
graydon carter editor of new yorks spy magazine says his 
publication owes its existence to private eye and its founding 
editor 51yearold richard ingrams 
richard ingrams was a guiding spirit and weve always 
appreciated the sauciness and the great investigations carter 
said in a telephone interview 
since the libel blow each issue includes a page listing several 
hundred donors and the quirkier letters of support are printed 
as a basic oldage pensioner hardly able to afford a new tire 
for my 1939 pushbike i have decided to drink water instead of beer 
for the rest of july wrote hj anderson of norfolk who sent 8 
an appeal of the libel verdict will be heard on oct 3 if the 
award is reduced hislop says the donations will go to families of 
sutcliffes victims 
according to loynes readers who went through the british private 
school network provide the magazine with highranking contacts in 
business politics and the bureaucracy 
journalists of the establishment media also use private eye to 
publish stories their own papers wont touch he said in an 
interview because private eye is prepared to take the risk to be 
irresponsible 
managing director david cash told the financial times in may that 
the magazines profits were just 4800 last year after making 
provisions for libel damages and costs of about 800000 
seventy percent of private eye shares are owned by comedian peter 
cook with smaller stakes owned by cash and founder ingrams who 
used to list his recreation in whos who as litigation 
hislop succeeded ingrams in 1986 long after the sutcliffe item 
appeared ironically when hislop took over one of his promises was 
to reduce the number of libel suits draining private eyes coffers

the 1983 korean airlines disaster is returning to 
television in an angloamerican docudrama focusing on 
behindthescenes political intrigue 
tailspin behind the korean airliner tragedy recreates the 
american political response to the soviet downing on aug 31 1983 
of kal flight 007 in which 269 people were killed 
the 90minute film stars chris sarandon as john lenczowski then 
soviet affairs director for the national security council and 
michael murphy as richard burt then the state departments 
assistant secretary for soviet affairs 
tailspin will be aired aug 20 on cable tvs home box office 
as the first in a threeproject partnership between hbo in the 
united states and granada television in britain the transatlantic 
lineup includes producer john smithson and director david darlow 
who are british and writer brian phelan an irishman besides 
sarandon and murphy the american cast includes harris yulin and 
michael moriarty 
in an onset interview last december in london producer smithson 
called the project a serious and intellectual work of the type you 
dont often see on american tv 
in more than 150 hours of interviews with up to 60 people some 
claimed the downing was a deliberate coldblooded soviet attack 
some that the airliner was on an espionage mission and some that it 
was all a tragic blunder missing american records fueled 
allegations of a coverup 
tailspin doesnt take sides smithson said it is interested 
not in fixing blame but in examining the middlelevel 
decisionmaking process in american government 
in one scene sarandon as lenczowski argues in a white house 
boardroom about the wording of a speech president reagan would later 
deliver 
were interested in the political battle in washington at the 
time between the state department and the nsc the center and the 
right said smithson 
he said the emergence of a soviet policy of glasnost or 
openness made tailspin a period piece with perceptions of the 
soviet union as the evil empire soon to be outmoded 
this is a curious piece of modern history an entirely 
preglasnost piece said smithson it marks a turningpoint 
where were beginning to see the softening of ronald reagan 
director david darlow said he intended the film to be an 
international political thriller 
if weve succeeded it will have a sort of all the presidents 
men feel about it said the director referring to alan pakulas 
acclaimed 1976 film about the watergate conspiracy 
in telling its story from the inside darlow distinguished his 
film from shootdown the nbc tvmovie with angela lansbury that 
aired last nov 28 that version examined the crises of the 
outsiders families of the victims and others 
tailspin focuses he said on three groups the hardline 
antisoviets represented by lenczowski the middle ground 
represented by the state department and pentagon officials who 
darlow said saw the incident as a gigantic screwup by the 
soviets 
sarandon a 1975 academy award nominee for dog day afternoon 
came to the project directly from filming in hungary he had no time 
to meet the real lenczowski now a strategic studies consultant at 
the council for interamerican security in washington 
but he thinks attitudes to the kal tragedy have changed following 
the us downing of a civilian iranian airliner in july 1988 
since that was as our government says accidental i think 
americans will be more openminded over the shooting down of the 
korean airliner sarandon said 
bridget potter hbos senior vicepresident for original 
programming agreed saying the later incident means the earlier one 
cannot be seen in isolation 
it can happen again she said mistakes are going to be 
made 
potter said the hbogranada partnership had resulted in a truly 
international style of tv that works for both british and us 
audiences

animal house is out and temperance in at zeta 
beta tau 
the national fraternity next month becomes the first to eliminate 
the traditional pledge period that rugged rite of passage when 
hazing can break both spirits and bones 
zbt like others also is cutting off fraternity spending on 
alcohol 
its not easy to implement it may be painful but nevertheless 
its an idea which we felt should be followed through said zbt 
executive director james e greer jr one of the movers behind the 
decision 
the rules are aimed at breaking the image of the stereotypical 
fraternity house john belushilike lunacy heavy drinking random 
abuse of pledges while keeping positive aspects such as bonding 
and community service greer said thursday 
zeta beta tau which has 5000 active members at more than 100 
chapters in the us and canada is the first national fraternity to 
put an end to pledging a dozen other national fraternities are 
considering similar plans said jonathan brant director of the 
national interfraternity conference 
its critical to eliminate hazing and this is a viable 
option said brant whose group includes 59 national fraternities 
we are supporting them and hope through their success others will 
learn the right lessons 
potential zbt members will be initiated as brothers within 72 
hours of receiving their invitation to join said greer once in 
there will be a combination of orientation and education for the new 
members rather than a torturous pledge period capped by hell 
night 
weve had as have other organizations a continuation of 
hazing incidents none lifethreatening or severe but we worry 
about it said greer we wanted to take the bull by the horns 
greer said no single incident prompted the decision but several 
highly publicized incidents involving other fraternities have 
focused attention on the organizations and hazing in the past two 
years 
a rutgers university pledge died of alcohol poisoning after a 
fraternity house party last year james callahan 18 had a blood 
alcohol level of 043 more than four times the legal limit 
a pledge at the university of lowell in massachusetts was 
stuffed in a sleeping bag while fraternity members turned on heaters 
nearby the pledge survived but arrived at the hospital with a body 
temperature of 109 degrees 
a university of delaware pledge charged in a lawsuit that a 
corrosive oven cleaner was dumped on his head during hell night 
activities 
the national fraternities dont like being identified as the 
root cause of problems said greer we have to find some answers 
and remain on the cutting edge of solving problems 
while zbts supreme council unanimously approved the new policy 
greer acknowledges response from its members both active and 
alumni has not been uniformly positive 
in the beginning there was a lot of shock and denial and anger 
that the national fraternity would do this said greer a class of 
64 zbt at california state university at long branch 
weve had letters and phone calls from alumni calling this a 
break with tradition saying they dont understand what were doing 
but overall its been far more positive than negative 
greer said his organization knew it was risking a possible 
falloff in membership and dues this year but was confident its 
decision would quickly turn into a recruiting advantage for zbt 
were dealing with a smarter more savvy freshman his parents 
read the papers they know whats going on with fraternities said 
greer once we get past the initial anxiety itll be to our 
advantage

they dont see the firefighters they cook 
for but the women of the salmon national forest fire kitchen fuss 
over every meal as if their favorite children were coming to dinner 
during fire season two crews of local women work round the 
clock housed in the basement of the bureau of land 
managementforest service warehouse the 20by30foot kitchen can 
prepare meals for 700 and the cooks have pushed the limit to more 
than 1000 when firefighters on lines in other parts of the state 
are still waiting for their caterers to arrive 
they cook in five and tengallon pots and stir their concoctions 
with ax handles the meals are airlifted to the fire camps 
retired cook evelyn yakovac was on hand when the fire kitchen 
opened more than 40 years ago 
it was before the forest service used helicopters so meals were 
packed in fivegallon tins and parachuted into the camps mrs 
yakovac recalls one fire in which the tbone steaks they sent got 
hung up in a tree and spoiled before the crews could get them down 
the advent of helicopters and pickups helped improve things she 
said it even meant they could send pies to the crews after the 
corn creek fire in 1961 mrs yakovac went home and built enough pie 
boxes to feed 180 people theyve been sending out pies ever since 
forest service regulations now require a caterer for a fire camp 
of more than 250 but the fire kitchen still finds itself busy 
serving smaller camps and picking up the caterers slack 
we do everything homemade here everything from scratch said 
virginia perry mrs yakovacs daughter and a 34year veteran who 
serves as head cook for the fiveperson daytime crew 
their menus include such entrees as steak chops chicken and 
casseroles plus a variety of salads and baked goods 
a meal of stew and fruit salad for 700 requires 100 gallons of 
stew 50 gallons of fruit salad 90 gallons of coffee 70 gallons of 
punch and 18 gallons of milk 
the women turn out meals for less than 10 a day for each 
firefighter forest service spokeswoman eileen havens said in 
contrast the forest service this year paid caterers more than 28 a 
day for each firefighters meals

for the movie when the trade paper daily variety named her 
hollywoods busiest actress with 11 films to her credit in the last

i knew i worked a lot but i was really surprised i was the 
busiest she said in a recent interview of course that kind of 
statistic is pretty misleading i do a lot of small character parts 
while some other actresses with bigger roles work on them a year or 
more 
i dont think meryl streep called to complain that she wasnt

the investigation of the united airlines dc10 
crash in sioux city iowa is looking into whether the engine 
breakup may have been triggered by cracks in its fan assembly 
officials say 
however no direct evidence of cracking has been found officials 
said thursday 
the national transportation safety board disclosed that a routine 
inspection of a general electric cf66 engine on another mcdonnell 
douglas dc10 at uniteds maintenance facility in san francisco 
recently uncovered a number of small cracks on a flange component of 
the fan assembly 
the safety board cited the discovery in a letter to the federal 
aviation administration in which it urged the faa to begin a special 
investigation to determine how much stress the ge engine can 
withstand before such components show signs of a problem including 
cracking 
the board however made no recommendations that would 
immediately affect the operation of any of the dc10s being flown 
with the cf66 engines there are 124 dc10s with that engine being 
flown by us airlines most belonging to united and american 
airlines the faa said 
united flight 232 crashed july 19 as it tried to make an 
emergency landing at the sioux city iowa airport killing 111 of 
the 296 people on board 
the planes no 2 engine located at the center tail section 
broke apart during flight the breakup in which much of the fan 
rotor assembly separated destroyed the jetliners hydraulic control 
system 
the safety board emphasized that critical parts of the engine 
including front portions of the fan assembly where the cracking was 
found in the engine in san francisco have not been found and are 
presumed scattered across the iowa countryside 
nevertheless the board said it was concerned that cracks similar 
to those found in san francisco may have developed in other cf66 
engines if such cracks were allowed to progress to the point that 
the fan flange were to fail the agency said it could cause 
catastrophic release of the engine fan section such as 
apparently occurred aboard flight 232 
anthony broderick acting faa executive director said in a 
telephone interview that the faa is aware of the cracks found in the 
united engine in san francisco 
however he disputed the theory that the cracks might be related 
to the iowa crash 
they were not cracks related to stress or strain on parts 
they are completely unrelated to the events in sioux city he 
said adding that the cracks appeared to have been caused by a 
chemical corrosion process rather than metal fatigue 
but broderick said the faa agreed with the ntsb recommendations 
and that a review of cf66 engine performance was under way 
the ntsb said the investigation of the cf66 engine should 
include close scrutiny of the design certification manufacture 
inspection and maintenance of the fan section of the engine 
it also should include various tests to determine the life 
limits of engine fan components so that inspection frequencies can 
be established for those engine parts the agency said

benjamin franklin said nothing is certain but 
death and taxes to the treasury department nothing is as certain 
either as the death of tuxes 
the departments depreciation analysis division has issued what 
is probably the first federal tuxedo study 
it is contained in 54 pages complete with tables three 
appendices graphs and a bibliography 
there are two major types of tuxedos basic black tuxedos and 
fashion tuxedos the analysts inform us 
basic black tuxedos generally do not change in style while 
fashion tuxedos generally change in style from year to year says 
the depreciation analysis division a newcomer on the governmental 
scene 
the basic black tuxedo ceases to rent either because it is worn 
out as a result of the multiple process of wearing and cleaning 
fashion tuxedos are also susceptible to sudden unrepairable damage 
but usually go out of style or become obsolete before they 
physically wear out 
the study was done to help determine the rate at which rental 
establishments should depreciate their tuxedos for tax purposes to 
the tax man depreciation is the process in which the owner of 
property is allowed to deduct the yearly decrease in the value of 
that property 
according to the report no matter how long a tuxedo may hang on 
a rack in the back room its economic life is only as long as 
customers want to rent it 
the principal findings of this study are that the equivalent 
economic life of tuxedos held for rental is 19 years while their 
useful life which measures the period of which they provide 
service is 37 years the report says if congress were to 
establish a separate asset class for tuxedos treasury would suggest 
that a 20 year life be assigned to such class 
the department chose august for its report perhaps to prove that 
some government is around what with the president in maine 
congress scattered to the four winds and bureaucrats at the beach 
the basic unit of input is the tuxedo jacket says the 
section on characteristics of the formal wear industry 
the average rental includes the jacket pants cummerbund 
shirt tie and studs since pants usually wear out faster than 
jackets approximately one and a third pairs of pants are purchased 
for each jacket 
the study notes that a set of tuxedos in a single style 
typically contains tuxedos in a wide range of sizes some of which 
may rent very frequently and others of which may rent hardly at 
all 
the latter are nevertheless needed because rentals are often 
made to entire wedding parties and it is necessary to fit the entire 
party in order to rent even a single tuxedo 
under the heading useful life of tuxedos the report to 
congress spells out the rental patterns reported for 199 styles of 
tuxes 
most styles 182 out of 199 had a useful life of approximately 
three to five years said the statisticians 
they found that formal wear rental companies infrequently sell 
used tuxedos 
industry representatives noted that before used tuxedos are 
discarded they may be spray painted shredded or their sleeves may 
be cut off to prevent the tuxedos from being worn when their 
appearance would no longer suggest elegance the report says 
there is thus little or no salvage value for retired tuxedos 
the tuxedo report is the first depreciation report issued by the 
depreciation analysis division there is no mention of what the 
second study might be

most livestock and poultry producers appear to 
have outdistanced the impact of last years drought and rising feed 
costs according to agriculture department economists 
prospects remain positive for continued expansion of red meat 
and poultry production as more favorable weather caused crop and 
forage conditions to improve in most areas the departments 
economic research service said thursday 
looking ahead the report said that total output of red meat and 
poultry in 1990 is expected to increase 2 percent to 3 percent from 
this years record level continuing the pace that began in 1982 
sharpest yeartoyear increase will occur in the broiler and 
turkey sectors but fed beef production from feedlots also may 
rise nonfed beef output probably will decline as herd expansion 
accelerates and pork production may slip about 1 percent after 
increasing since 1986 
a rebound in crop production from last years droughtshriveled 
output is expected to result in lower feed costs as corn and 
soybean prices drop below the levels of a year ago 
continued expansion in meat exports will soften price impacts 
of record production the report said however rising per 
capita meat consumption in 1990 together with a slowing economy and 
a lower rate of increase in consumer real incomes should result in 
only modest increase in red meat prices and declining poultry 
prices 
analysts said consumer prices of beef and pork may increase 1 
percent to 3 percent next year but because of sharp production 
increases retail prices of broilers may drop 8 percent to 20 
percent and turkey prices may decline 3 percent to 5 percent from 
1989 averages 
improved returns for egg producers and prospects for lower feed 
costs are expected to boost 1990 egg output 1 percent to 2 percent 
the report said as a result retail egg prices may decline 10 
percent to 15 percent per capita egg consumption could rise for the 
first time since 1979 
cattle producers indicated july 1 that herd expansion is 
continuing although slowed by drought in some areas 
beef cow inventories were up marginally for the second 
consecutive year and producers were holding 4 percent more beef 
replacement heifers for possible expansion in 1990 according to the 
july 1 figures 
current inventory estimates indicate that as feed prices 
decline feeder cattle supplies will be adequate to allow an 
accelerated pace of herd expansion and increased fed cattle 
marketings in 1990 the report said 
in a related report thursday the usda said the number of cattle 
being fed for the slaughter market as of aug 1 in the seven major 
beef states totaled 657 million head down 4 percent from a year 
ago and 2 percent below the level of two years ago 
marketings of fed cattle in july totaled 169 million head down 
4 percent from a year ago and 1 percent below two years ago 
but the placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last 
month was reported at 131 million head up 5 percent from a year 
ago and 3 percent more than two years ago 
as of aug 1 feedlot inventories were smaller than a year 
earlier in arizona kansas nebraska and texas only california and 
colorado feedlots showed increases while those in iowa were 
reported unchanged 
state feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven 
states which account for about threefourths of the nations beef 
the first number is the number of cattle in thousands as of aug 
1 and the second number is the percentage of a year earlier

china has bought us corn for the first time 
in almost two years along with more wheat for delivery in the 
marketing year that began june 1 
the sales disclosed thursday by the agriculture department 
included 150000 metric tons of corn and 100000 tons of wheat no 
further details were announced 
although china has been buying us wheat periodically it was 
the first purchase of corn since december 1987 officials said in 
that year china bought 278500 tons of corn 
the latest wheat sales boosted to more than 348 million tons the 
amount of us wheat china has purchased for the 198990 season 
officials said last years sales totaled 83 million tons making 
china the leading foreign market for american wheat farmers 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat or 394 bushels of corn the 100000 tons of wheat would be 
about 367 million bushels and the 150000 tons of corn would be 
about 591 million bushels 
wheat prices at the farm have averaged around 373 per bushel 
nationally according to usda recent fiveday market estimates that 
would make the sale worth about 14 million 
corn prices at about 226 per bushel would make the corn sale 
worth about 134 million

consumers looking for a reputable physician often 
turn to the yellow pages but researchers say verifying the 
credentials advertised can be all but impossible 
confirming a doctors education specialty training 
certification and other background is frequently beyond the average 
citizens grasp according to an article published thursday in the 
new england journal of medicine 
its very difficult in most communities in this country for 
patients to get important facts about physicians theyd like to 
consult said dr arnold s relman the journals editor in chief 
the problem is that no straightforward directory is available to 
the public and those who consult professional listings often find 
them indecipherable 
while trying to ascertain how physicians credentials 
corresponded to those they listed we encountered a veritable 
obstacle course of inconsistent and illogical policies that 
effectively deny information to the consumer wrote drs julia m 
reade and richard m ratzan who conducted the informal survey 
in conclusion obtaining access to complete uptodate and 
verified information about physicians is all but impossible 
like many consumers reade and ratzan started their research by 
thumbing through the yellow pages 
they found southern new england telephone cos listings were not 
routinely corroborated and included a warning suggesting additional 
consultation with a local medical association 
the hartford conn county medical association which receives 
about 20000 similar inquiries annually answered many of the 
researchers questions 
but the process is rarely that simple they reported 
many medical associations are too small or are unwilling to 
commit the time and manpower needed to provide rigorous 
verification and they accept at face value whatever information the 
physician supplies according to the researchers 
reade is a psychiatrist at massachusetts general hospital ratzan 
an associate professor at the university of connecticut school of 
medicine 
because physicians supply much of their own background 
information relman said patients may face medical fraud doctors 
who need periodic recertification in their specialities may skip 
the exams or if they fail to pass not report the results he said 
to protect consumers organized medicine must take the 
initiative and see that standardized directories about physicians be 
provided and readily accessible to the public said relman who 
for more than a decade has pushed for an accessible consumer 
directory 
if i were sick and needed an operation i would want to know a 
lot about the surgeon who was going to operate on me relman said 
but if youre a lay person and dont have access to professional 
sources of information its rather difficult 
tenacious consumers can track down the american medical 
associations directory but the guide uses complicated numerical 
and letter codes in verifying information about a physicians year 
and state of licensure medical school and specialtyboard 
certification 
beyond that no information is provided on advanced training 
thus there is no way to distinguish between the selfstyled 
cardiologist with board certification in internal medicine alone and 
the cardiologist who has board certification in that 
subspecialty the doctors said 
the researchers studied several other compendiums including 
howto manuals spawned in the 1970s by the consumer movement but 
found similar gaps and obstacles in each case 
state licensing boards agreed that the best way to remedy 
patients confusion would be to establish a carefully verified 
directory reade and razan reported

federal investigators are trying to determine 
how defense contractors supposedly obtained secret budget documents 
containing details on the militarys spending plans for weapons 
although the inquiry has centered so far on the boeing co a 
major defense contractor it is expected to extend to other defense 
contractors government officials familiar with the case said 
thursday 
the investigation is being run by the pentagon inspector 
generals office and is separate from the 3yearold ill wind 
investigation of bribery and influencepeddling in the awarding of 
defense department contracts 
the ill wind investigation conducted by the justice 
department focused on the role of private consultants in obtaining 
inside information about pentagon contracts 
the separate boeing case became public tuesday when richard lee 
fowler a former boeing official was indicted by a federal grand 
jury in suburban alexandria va on 39 counts of theft conspiracy 
and fraud the charges stem from his alleged trafficking in 
classified documents according to the indictment 
its part of a continuing investigation by the department of 
defense inspector generals office into how certain contractors and 
their employees have illegally trafficked in classified documents 
said one pentagon official speaking on condition of anonymity 
how fowler obtained these documents is the subject of further 
investigation 
according to the 68page indictment fowler while he worked for 
boeing in washington as a senior marketing analyst from 1978 to 
1986 obtained hundreds of the pentagons most sensitive documents 
among those papers were air force and navy directives on budget 
proposals along with the defense departments fiveyear plan 
according to the indictment 
the fiveyear plan is closely held within the pentagon because it 
is the chief defense spending blueprint used by the secretary of 
defense joint chiefs of staff and civilian service leaders in 
making major budget decisions about weapons 
in addition fowler received three national security council 
decision directives signed by former president reagan the 
indictment charged distribution of those documents is extremely 
limited 
the three documents dealt with the strategic defense initiative 
a proposed shield against nuclear attack the indictment said but 
it did not give more details 
although fowler had a highlevel security clearance he didnt 
have authorized access to those papers the indictment said 
fowler refused to discuss the case contacted by telephone at his 
suburban virginia home he said only i do not wish to comment 
whatsoever on any of this 
fowler was fired by boeing in september 1986 said harold carr a 
spokesman for the company in seattle the wall street journal said 
the firing was because investigators were looking at fowlers 
activities 
carr said boeing is cooperating with the investigators 
there has been a considerable number of requests for documents 
papers records and so on he said we have provided those and 
will continue to answer requests for them 
after obtaining the papers fowler passed them along to boeing 
officials and other unnamed contractors the indictment said he 
also allegedly obtained some documents that had been specifically 
requested by boeing officials 
none of the other people under investigation are identified 
although the indictment said some of other alleged conspirators 
created separate log books to keep pentagon officials from knowing 
that boeing had the unauthorized classified documents boeing has 
authority to handle certain classified documents because it is a 
major defense contractor

the latest test failure of the trident 2 
missile isnt expected to affect plans to put the submarinelaunched 
weapon to sea next year the navy says 
however the admiral in charge of the navys newest and 
reportedly most deadly weapon says hell delay deployment if he has 
to 
a trident 2 missile exploded tuesday seconds after being 
launched from the nuclear submarine tennessee about 200 miles off 
the coast of florida it was the second such failure in three 
undersea test firings 
the threestage trident 2 is a more lethal version of the trident 
1 the heart of the navys nuclear deterrent the new version built 
by the lockheed missiles amp space co is almost twice as heavy as 
its predecessor 
the trident 2 each of which costs 265 million is to be 
deployed in the 1990s aboard a new generation of submarines 
providing the seabased leg of americas land sea and air nuclear 
forces 
until the test failures the missile had been one of the defense 
departments nuclear modernization programs to be mostly 
problemfree with 16 of 19 successful land launchings 
in a statement released thursday at the pentagon the navy said 
that despite the latest test failure no impact is presently 
foreseen on the planned deployment of the uss tennessee in early 
1990 
the tennessee is to be the first of nine submarines equipped to 
carry 24 of the missiles 
the statement said that problems with water pressures on the 
missile appear to have caused electrical cables in the firststage 
motor to sever triggering the missiles selfdestruct order 
rear adm kenneth c malley said in an interview published 
thursday in the new york times that hes confident problems with the 
missile will be resolved by the march 31 target date for deployment 
if i have to slip the date again ill slip it again said 
malley who earlier delayed the target date by three months 
the navy told the associated press on thursday that malley was 
not available for an interview but it did confirm that his 
statements to the times were accurate 
malley told the newspaper that initial reports from tuesdays 
failed test indicated that engineers despite computer simulations 
seriously underestimated the amount of pressure on the trident 
the missile he said is much larger than anything weve fired 
before we expected some extra pressure on the rear end of the 
missile and its rocket nozzles but not as much as were seeing it 
turns out that the pressure and the aft load are much more severe 
than was anticipated 
asked if the failures were a result of a design error or a flaw 
in the manufacturing malley said the device was built to 
specification there is no question that it was designed the way it 
was intended to be designed 
in a statement the navy said the submarine will undergo a 
twomonth shakedown at the electric boat docks in groton conn 
during that time evaluation and correction action for the test 
failure will be conducted

depression robs people of the ability to function 
more often than arthritis ulcers diabetes or high blood pressure 
according to researchers who say depression is taken much too 
lightly 
weve greatly underestimated up until now how disabling 
depression is related to other chronic medical conditions said 
john e ware jr principal investigator in a study that questioned 
11242 outpatients in three cities 
depression proved at least as bad as emphysema or back problems 
at limiting people in their physical functioning or causing them to 
stay in bed said the study published in todays journal of the 
american medical association 
the only two worse chronic conditions were heart pain and 
advanced coronary artery disease in terms of limiting activities 
such as walking dressing bathing climbing stairs or participating 
in sports the study found 
the findings are very important said dr martin b keller a 
depression researcher and director of psychiatric research at 
massachusetts general hospital in boston 
four percent of the us population or 99 million people 
suffer from major depression at some point in any given year he 
said 
millions more may have some depressive symptoms and may be 
highly treatable with antidepressant medications said dr john 
zajecka clinical director of psychiatric treatment research at 
rushpresbyterianst lukes medical center in chicago 
depressed people sometimes give up jobs and lose spouses while 
bouncing from doctor to doctor for years before being correctly 
diagnosed and effectively treated he said 
dr gerald klerman a depression researcher and psychiatry 
professor at cornell university medical college in new york 
estimated that only about 20 percent of depressives are getting 
treated 
the majority suffer in silence or are misdiagnosed as having 
tension anxiety personality disorder or weak character he said 
the study coordinated by the rand corp in santa monica calif 
looked at adult patients in a variety of settings health 
maintenance organizations group medical practices and solo 
practices in los angeles chicago and boston 
about half of the subjects studied suffered from either 
depressive symptoms or one of eight chronic medical conditions 
high blood pressure diabetes advanced coronary heart disease 
heart pain arthritis back problems lung problems or digestive 
problems 
more than onefifth of the subjects a total of 2467 people 
reported depressive symptoms which they typically explained to 
their doctors as feeling down in the dumps or chronically tired 
ware said 
such patients experienced as much or more bodily pain and stayed 
in bed as many or more days as patients with back lung or digestive 
problems heart pain high blood pressure or diabetes the 
researchers found 
only arthritis proved more painful and only advanced heart 
disease caused more bed days they said 
in addition patients with depressive symptoms reported 
significantly less ability to function socially than those with any 
of the chronic medical conditions the researchers said 
if the doctor is unable to come up with a certified 
psychiatric diagosis that doesnt mean the person can be ignored 
said ware a research psychologist and senior scientist at new 
england medical center hospitals in boston 
such patients have a tremendous unmet need and burden that 
costs a lot from societys point of view because theyre not able 
to function he said

charges that exxon was negligent in failing to prevent the march 24 
spill 
it also contends that exxon and its six partners in the alyeska 
pipeline service co which runs the transalaska oil pipeline 
fraudulently misrepresented their ability to prevent or control a 
major spill 
this lawsuit simply seeks to force those who caused the 
unprecedented assault on the environment to pay to restore one of 
the worlds last reservoirs of natural beauty to its original 
unspoiled state said the complaint by the national wildlife 
federation and the natural resources defense council 
sharon newsome the wildlife federations vice president for 
resources conservation told a news conference the suit 
complements and reinforces one filed tuesday by alaska seeking 
to recover unspecified damages for losses from the spill 
the suit by the environmental groups says exxon should be forced 
to finance a courtcontrolled fund to cover the cost of assessing 
and repairing environmental damage in areas affected by the spill 
the money which ms newsome said would amount to billions also 
would be used to buy natural resources such as fish and wildlife to 
compensate for ecological damage that cannot be repaired 
exxon spokeswoman sarah johnson said the company would not 
comment on the suit until it had seen it 
the suit says exxon should pay for the establishment of an 
independent group of scientists appointed by the alaska court to 
control and monitor the environmental restoration effort

herbert lee richardson was executed in 
alabamas electric chair early friday for the 1977 pipebomb killing 
of an 11yearold girl 
richardson was pronounced dead at 1214 am 
the us supreme court refused thursday to intervene in the case 
after the 11th us circuit court of appeals in atlanta upheld a 
lower courts decision to reject a stay of execution 
gov guy hunt earlier refused to grant clemency for richardson 
who was married last week in a prison ceremony 
richardson 43 was condemned to die in the electric chair at 
holman prison for the murder of rena mae callins whose body was 
blown apart on the porch of her home when she picked up a pipebomb 
and it detonated 
richardson contended the device was not meant to explode only to 
scare the girls family the girls aunt had broken off a 
relationship with him shortly before the pipebomb was planted 
us district judge robert varner of montgomery who rejected 
richardsons motion for a stay said it is beyond the bounds of 
reason to believe that a device which maimed and killed an 
11yearold child by exploding in her hands could be thought of 
as not presenting a serious risk of harm 
i cant rest until he gets the chair said margie callins 
the girls mother 
in montgomery lucia penland of the alabama prison project said 
richardson was what most of us would call an allaround american 
boy with a bright future before he went to vietnam 
she also said the terrible tragedy of mrs callins and her 
family cannot be understated 
courts in recent weeks have rejected defense claims that 
richardson wrongly was denied a statefunded psychologist to show 
that he possibly was suffering posttraumatic stress disorder 
stemming from his vietnam war experiences 
richardson was married aug 9 at holman prison system 
spokeswoman debbie herbert said 
they let him out of the cell to go into the visiting room and 
she the bride was there along with some other guests and after the 
prison chaplain married them they had some cake and then he 
returned to his cell mrs herbert said 
the governors press secretary terry abbott said that according 
to the clemency plea richardson and his wife katie met 3 years 
ago he wrote a letter to her church saying he listened to their 
broadcast and she started visiting abbott said 
the church was identified as el bethel primitive baptist church 
in mobile

for the third time this year scientists 
discovered an asteroid will fly relatively close to earth and while 
there is no threat of collision experts say such a disaster is 
likely sometime in the future 
while the new asteroid poses no immediate danger in 
astronomical terms it will be making a very close pass when it 
comes within 2 million miles of earth about 8 pm pdt next 
thursday night said planetary scientist eleanor helin who 
discovered the milewide hunk of rock 
at 2 million miles about 10 times the distance between the 
earth and the moon the asteroid designated 1989 pb will be one 
of the very closest larger objects to pass the earth this century 
said helin a planetary scientist at the national aeronautics and 
space administrations jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena 
its not going to hit us certainly theres no danger 
astronomer brian marsden said by telephone from cambridge mass 
where he directs the international astronomical unions central 
bureau for astronomical telegrams an astronomy reporting agency 
one doesnt want to worry people but anything thats crossing 
the orbit of the earth stands a chance of hitting the earth but 
its much more likely to be later than sooner im talking millions 
of years marsden said thursday 
in march asteroid 1989 fc no more than a halfmile in diameter 
passed within a half million miles of earth but wasnt discovered 
by astronomers until april in june a 2milewide asteroid passed 
about 8 million miles from earth 
scientists have said that if 1989 fc had hit earth it would have 
done so with the power of about 40 billion tons of tnt or about 
40000 hydrogen bombs enough to wipe out entire cities asteroid 
1989 pb is about twice as large 
helin said the discovery of asteroids passing near earth is 
ominous because if we are finding two or three a year this close 
to the earth there is strong evidence of a sizable population of 
these objects that can be devastating its the one we dont see 
thats going to kill us 
she discovered asteroid 1989 pb on aug 9 in film taken on the 
18inch schmidt telescope at palomar observatory northeast of san 
diego astronomers were quickly notified but it wasnt until 
thursday that word of the discovery was made public by the south 
pasadenabased world space foundation which helps finance searches 
for nearearth asteroids 
we feel comfortable with the very low probability of any 
serious impact during our lifetime but there always remains that 
slight possibility said robert staehle foundation president 
staehle said that in 30 to 50 years humans may be able to land 
spacecraft on any asteroid heading toward earth and either put 
some sort of explosives on it or perhaps deflect it using a solar 
sail or some other propulsion technique 
craters around the globe provide little doubt that asteroids 
smacked into earth in prehistoric times scientists have blamed a 
comet exploding in earths atmosphere for a 1908 blast in siberia 
that devastated miles of uninhabited terrain and was heard thousands 
of miles away 
in recent years many scientists have become convinced that 
asteroids striking earth caused some mass extinctions including the 
demise of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago other scientists 
however blame extinctions on gradual climate change or massive 
volcanic eruptions 
marsden said amateur astronomers may be able to see asteroid 1989 
pb through telescopes by looking in the constellation cassiopeia at 
the time of its closest approach to earth 
the asteroid moves around the sun in an elliptical orbit that 
ranges from inside of venus orbit to a bit outside mars orbit he 
said

aids has reached the 100000case milestone in the 
united states less than two years after the deadly disease hit 
50000 
the national centers for disease control said that through july 
102621 cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome have been 
reported in the united states a total of 59391 or 58 percent of 
those patients have already died 
us health officials estimate that between 1 million and 15 
million americans are infected with hiv or human immunodeficiency 
virus the virus which causes aids a study among homosexual or 
bisexual males the largest risk group for aids suggests that up 
to 99 percent of those infected will eventually develop the disease 
as scientists have noted for years since the disease was 
discovered in 1981 the case count is growing at a faster pace with 
the spread of the disease where the first 50000 aids cases in the 
united states were reported between 1981 and late 1987 the next 
50000 were reported in less than two years between december 1987 
and july 1989 
aids continues to occur increasingly among abusers of injectable 
drugs in the first six months of 1989 23 percent of reported aids 
patients were female or heterosexual male users of intravenous 
drugs the cdc said that compares with 18 percent among the cases 
reported before 1985 
meanwhile 56 percent of the cases reported in the first half of 
this year were among homosexual or bisexual males compared with 63 
percent before 1985 
gay or bisexual men make up 60 percent of the 102621 reported 
aids cases twenty percent are iv drug abusers and 7 percent are 
both four percent are blamed on heterosexual contact 
aids is transmitted through blood or body fluids chiefly through 
sex or the sharing of drug needles

more than 71000 americans a year die from 
emphysema and bronchitis and similar chronic lung diseases the 
vast majority from smoking and the west has the highest death 
rate us health researchers say 
the national centers for disease control reported thursday that 
71099 americans died of emphysema bronchitis and similar chronic 
lung diseases in 1986 the latest year for which complete statistics 
are available 
cdc statisticians used information about the prevalence of 
smoking and the risks of smoking to project that 82 percent of the 
lungdisease deaths were attributable to smoking 
the highest death rates were across the west with the exception 
of utah and hawaii the cdc said the highest rate was in wyoming 
with 49 such deaths per 100000 people in 1986 significantly higher 
than the national average of 295 
other states with the worst lungdisease death rates were 
kentucky west virginia and maine 
the lowest rates were in the upper midwest the 
texastomississippi belt and the middle northeast and the lowest 
rate of all was in hawaii with 169 such deaths per 100000 
the higher rates in the west came despite a generally higher 
prevalence of smokers in the east the cdc said 
but emphysema and bronchitis like lung cancer can take decades 
to attack and kill smokers so todays death rates could reflect 
smoking patterns of many years ago or even migration by former 
smokers to the west the cdc said 
what happens with emphysema and bronchitis is as it is with 
lung cancer its what you did a long time ago that affects your 
current disease status said dr robert hahn a cdc specialist in 
lung diseases 
the cdc said the national mortality rate from lung diseases such 
as bronchitis and emphysema at 295 per 100000 people is up 33 
percent from 1979 when the rate was about 22 deaths per 100000 
the rate has risen just 15 percent in males over that time but 
has increased 80 percent in females reflective of a later move by 
women to give up smoking hahn said 
although smoking by men peaked in the 1950s smoking by women 
didnt peak until the mid1960s he said their lung disease death 
rates therefore continue to rise reflecting their smoking habits 
from three decades ago 
women still have rapidly rising rates and well probably see 
that for another 10 years he said 
the lung disease death rate nonetheless was 18 times as high 
in men as in women in 1986 it also was 28 times higher for whites 
than for blacks the cdc said 
the cdc also used information about smoking prevalence and 
smoking cessation in each state to project geographic trends in 
smokingrelated deaths due to lung disease 
like the overall death rates the highest smokingrelated rates 
were again generally found in the west with lower numbers in the 
east plus hawaii and utah

former president carter will serve as a neutral 
observer when ethiopian officials and leaders of a rebel group hold 
preliminary peace talks next month at carters policy center 
carter announced thursday that the talks between the government 
of ethiopia and the eritrean peoples liberation front will begin 
sept 7 at the carter center of emory university in atlanta 
he said the talks which will last for several days will lay the 
groundwork for further negotiations toward ending the civil war in 
ethiopia 
in the history of political affairs the most significant 
single step is the first meeting carter said by telephone from 
his home in plains one of the things we hope to do is to provide 
both sides with an understanding of one another that will lead to a 
complete resolution of the longstanding conflict 
the eritreans who have been fighting with ethiopia since 1961 
want independence federation with ethiopia or regional autonomy for 
their northern province 
carter visited ethiopia during a tour of africa last month and 
met with ethiopian leader mengistu haile mariam who had announced 
june 5 that his government was ready to meet with the eritreans and 
another rebel group the tigre peoples liberation front in the 
presence of an international observer 
the former president said at the time that he would act as 
official mediator if both sides asked 
carter said thursday he could not guess how long it might take 
for a peace accord to be worked out but he added i would hope 
not years because the war continues and the suffering continues 
dayle powell a carter center fellow who works on conflict 
resolution said mengistu and eplf general secretary isaias afwerki 
would not be among those attending the atlanta talks she said the 
names of the negotiators and the exact size of the negotiating teams 
would not be made public 
carter praised both leaders for planning the talks and said he is 
convinced that each has a sincere commitment to achieving peace 
for his people and desires a return to economic prosperity for the 
region 
the tigre peoples liberation front was not included in the talks 
because the demands or goals of the tigre movement are quite 
different from those of the eritreans carter said he said he 
hoped the ethiopian government would talk with that rebel group as 
well 
thursdays announcement said both sides agreed that the atlanta 
talks would be announced publicly and that no preconditions would be 
set by either party 
carter said the talks will be held under the auspices of the 
international negotiation network which is based at the carter 
center and which offers thirdparty assistance to reduce world 
conflicts

sir james goldsmith is taking up the cudgel 
again against critics of his multibilliondollar hostile takeover 
bid for britains bat industries plc the worlds largest tobacco 
company and its us affiliates 
goldsmith in a statement issued from london on thursday labeled 
criticism by us unions and kentucky gov wallace g wilkinson as 
examples of extensive lobbying by us tobacco interests 
the anglofrench financier last month launched a 216 billion 
bid for the company along with british merchant banker jacob 
rothschild and australian investor kerry packer 
in washington on thursday union officials held a news conference 
to charge that the takeover would jeopardize the jobs of 55000 
american workers 
where his takeovers have been successful goldsmith has 
dismantled companies sold off assets closed down plants and raided 
pension funds in each case workers have paid a heavy price said 
john deconcini president of the bakery confectionery and tobacco 
workers international union 
also thursday wilkinson met with bat chairman patrick sheehy in 
london to offer his help in thwarting the takeover 
wilkinson said he expressed concern about the impact of a 
takeover on the 1500 kentuckians who work for bat subsidiaries as 
well as on 100000 kentucky tobacco farmers 
bats us subsidiary louisville kybased batus inc oversees 
brown amp williamson tobacco corp which employs more than 5000 
people 
goldsmith meanwhile reiterated earlier statements that among 
us companies he has acquired there are presently significantly 
more people employed in the aggregate than prior to the time of the 
acquisition 
the cashless offer for bat by hoylake investments ltd would be 
financed largely through money borrowed against the concerns 
existing assets known as a leveraged buyout 
the group has said it intends to sell the nontobacco businesses 
of bat which also has significant interests in financial services 
paper and retailing including such us holdings as saks fifth 
avenue and marshall field department stores and farmers insurance 
group 
union officials concede there is no absolute proof a goldsmith 
takeover would result in layoffs but rudy oswald of the aflcio 
said thursday that corporate mergers takeovers and leveraged 
buyouts have cost more than 90000 union workers their jobs since 
1980 
union officials listed 30 such corporate actions including 
goldsmiths aborted 1986 bid for goodyear tire and rubber co and 
his successful takeover of the james river paper company in 1985 
they say cost thousands their jobs 
the list included batus closing of the gimbels department store 
chain which union officials said cost 5000 jobs 
goldsmith said in his statement that the only jobs at risk under 
his bat takeover proposal were those held by senior company 
officials in london 
more than 200 members of congress last week signed a letter 
urging secretary of state james a baker iii to express concern to 
the british government about the multinational leveraged buyout

pollution by promoting the burning of toxic wastes 
the national toxics campaign fund a private organization that 
focuses on toxic pollution issues said at a news conference outside 
the agencys headquarters thursday that epas policies will 
encourage more toxic waste production 
the epa issued a statement saying the group seriously 
distorts the agencys role in the disposal of such wastes 
the only thing were prompting is waste reduction said epa 
spokeswoman robin woods were encouraging states to consider 
all waste reduction opportunities secondly were looking at them to 
look at existing disposal facilities out of state and as a last 
resort build new facilities 
she said that the epa requires strict emission controls when 
toxic wastes are burned 
the environmental group said the epa does not focus enough in 
getting companies and industrial plants to invest in technology that 
would reduce toxic emissions 
instead the critics maintained agency policy requires state and 
local officials to develop new toxic disposal facilities such as 
additional landfills or incinerators

leaders of an american indian coalition 
say theyre haunted by the image of their ancestors remains stored 
in boxes in museums and universities they want them returned for 
burial 
were asking that they bring them back to their lands their 
natural resting place thats what they deserve says delfino 
begay governor of laguna pueblo in new mexico 
the national congress of american indians meeting in albuquerque 
this week estimates the bones of 25 million indians are held in 
public and private collections nationwide museum spokesmen dispute 
the figure estimating institutions hold the remains of 100000 to 
250000 
one of the largest collections is at the smithsonian institution 
in washington dc which says it has 18600 such remains stacked 
in boxes in a hallway closed to the public 
the smithsonian along with a number of other museums and 
universities is studying the bones to learn more about the bone 
structure diseases and lifestyles of american indians of more than 
a century ago 
the indian leaders representing about 20 tribes at conference 
want the remains returned now or at the very least when the 
studies are completed 
some say they have nightmares about the unburied dead 
you really dont get the feeling of the smithsonian until 
you get there and see the boxes upon boxes in the hallway said 
lawrence kenmill a member of the salishkootenay tribal council 
from pablo mont 
you get all kinds of feelings put together youre sad youre 
hurt youre angry you get them all at once when youre looking at 
it 
the delegates agreed the situation has improved in the past 10 
years with new laws protecting disposition of newly unearthed 
remains some institutions also have returned bones 
last week for instance about 1200 pounds of prehistoric 
remains of members of the seminole tribe were reburied at wounded 
knee sd after being stored at the university of south dakota for 
the past three years 
the remains had been unearthed at a construction site near tampa 
fla their new gravesite will become part of the national indian 
cemetery 
the smithsonian also recently returned remains of 16 blackfeet 
that were improperly taken from a blackfeet cemetery and the 
university of tennessee repatriated 190 cherokee remains exhumed in 
1967 
but the indian leaders point out the returned remains are a small 
fraction of what is being held they are particularly concerned with 
older bones including skulls taken for cranial studies by the us 
army medical corps during the civil war and wars with indians 
smithsonian spokeswoman madeleine jacobs said comparative studies 
are still being done on the skulls she also said the smithsonian 
was evaluating its policy of holding onto the remains 
our goal is to come to an accommodation with them she said 
of discussions with indian groups i think we all feel there is a 
solution other large collections are at the field museum in 
chicago the peabody at harvard university the university of 
california and the american museum of natural history in new york 
researchers say they are reluctant to relinquish the remains 
because of recent breakthroughs 
harold voris the fields vice president of collections and 
research said dna fingerprinting has revealed a wealth of 
information from the bones 
it may help find the kinds of illness people were prone to 
he said ms jacobs said researchers have learned that rheumatoid 
arthritis is more prevalent in indians than in the general 
population 
and dr jefferson chapman curator of archaeology at the mcclung 
museum in knoxville tenn said the university of tennessees 5500 
remains are now being used for research of spina bifida a defect

a 65 million navstar navigation 
satellite rocketed into orbit early today a half hour after liftoff 
from cape canaveral 
a threestage delta 2 rocket blazed away from its launch pad at 
158 am and left a fiery trail in the sky as it sped over the 
atlantic ocean and climbed toward space 
the air force reported 30 minutes after liftoff that the 
128foottall rocket had performed flawlessly and had propelled the 
satellite into an initial elliptical orbit ranging from about 100 to 
11000 miles above the earth 
the delta 2 has put its payload into a successful orbit said 
lt col ron rand the launch control center commentator 
on sunday ground controllers will command an onboard motor to 
fire to shift the satellite into a circular orbit about 11000 miles 
up 
the 30 million delta rocket carried a navstar global positioning 
system satellite the third in a new series of spacecraft which 
enable military units such as aircraft ships submarines tanks and 
field troops to determine their location within 50 feet and in some 
cases to within 10 feet 
the satellites effective in any kind of weather also keep track 
of military units speed within a fraction of a mile per hour and 
the precise time within a millionth of a second 
each 3675pound navstar contains an atomic clock with an error 
rate of one second every 300000 years 
american and allied military users receive information from a 
coded channel civilian users also with access to the satellite 
system would monitor an open channel providing them with less 
accurate position information within 300 feet 
the satellite launched today is the third of 21 upgraded block 2 
navstars that the air force plans to orbit to complete a global 
system by 1992 the first two were launched in february and june 
seven earlier block 1 navstars also are orbiting the earth the 
new model has more power and improved systems and has added the 
coded military channel

soaring imports contributed to a 38 billion 
deficit in trade and tourism last year official reports said today 
the state administration of foreign exchange recorded an 
increase however in chinas foreign currency reserves excluding 
gold to 173 billion from 152 billion in 1987 the china daily 
said 
the report said china posted a 713 billion surplus in its 
capital accounts including direct investment and international 
loans 
the 38 billion deficit in the current account which includes 
trade and tourism was largely due to a doubling of the nations 
trade deficit because of sluggish export growth and soaring imports 
it said 
according to international monetary fund accounting procedures 
chinas exports in 1988 totaled 41 billion up 182 percent over 
1987 while its imports grew 274 percent to 463 billion the 
report said

million trade deficit for july the official xinhua news agency said

the chicago symphony orchestra which has 
performed to acclaim worldwide will be leaving for europe again 
next week but first it will try to win over a new audience at home 
its performances this weekend at a black south side church are 
aimed at dispelling the notion that symphony concerts are white 
elitist events 
michael morgan the black assistant conductor who put the show 
together says the idea of the concerts during which hell direct a 
symphony by a celebrated black composer as well as several black 
soloists is to establish a twoway flow between the orchestra 
and the black community 
we certainly want to include as many parts and ethnic groups in 
the city as we can morgan said we start in the black community 
because of the misconception that there is no interest in the black 
community in this sort of music 
morgan said he still encounters the attitude that orchestra 
hall concerts are white elitist events and that members of the 
black community arent really welcome thats not true 
the orchestra rarely performs outside of orchestra hall or its 
summer home in the northern suburbs it first reached out to the 
citys south side with an outdoor concert in 1987 but the 
rainmarred memorial day event was a bust that drew few spectators 
then came the chance to perform tonight and saturday at christ 
universal temple a relatively new church that seats nearly 4000 
and boasts the talented christ universal temple ensemble a 
90voice choir that performed with the chicago symphony choir in 
april 
blacks do not historically come to hear a symphony they may 
be fans of classical music but they dont come to orchestra hall to 
hear a symphony said joyce idema an orchestra spokeswoman we 
thought that this was a wonderful opportunity to go to them 
morgan said he will direct the symphony no 1 the 
afroamerican symphony written in 1930 by william grant still 
the first widely played black composer 
black vocal soloists geraldine mcmillian and ben holt will 
perform songs by richard strauss and the temple ensemble will 
perform an excerpt from a brahms requiem as well as spirituals to 
show the roots of the whole process morgan said 
a native of washington dc morgan studied in vienna and has 
performed as a guest conductor with major opera companies and 
symphony orchestras in the united states and abroad before joining 
the chicago symphony in 1986 
still he is one of the few black artists working in the upper 
levels of a major symphony morgan noted there are still no 
fulltime black instrumentalists with the chicago symphony 
tonights soldout concert and a second performance for young 
people on saturday are a chance to start to change that he said 
it falls upon us now to start to see that students from the 
various minority communities have early enough exposure and 
sufficient training to be ready to pass the rather arduous audition 
process for a major symphony said the 31yearold morgan 
keith king a black 15yearold chicago high school student 
will be a featured soloist in the glazunov saxophone concerto at 
saturdays performance 
to see this young black man hopefully will be very 
inspirational to the young black people said the rev robert 
mayes who writes much of the music for the temple ensemble 
king who aspires to be a classical saxophonist with a major 
orchestra someday shares the message morgan hopes to carry 
i think it will show people that classical music is not really 
for a certain type of crowd everyone can enjoy it he said

the state of minnesota has a triple 
standard on premarital sex says the lawyer for a man appealing a 
finding of discrimination for refusing to rent to an unmarried 
couple 
james anderson who represented marshall area resident layle 
french before the state court of appeals on thursday said the 
states fornication law is in conflict with a law that gives 
unmarried couples the right to housing 
furthermore he said the state university system forbids couples 
to cohabitate in dormitories an apparent violation of the 
antidiscrimination law ordinary landlords must follow anderson 
told the threemember panel 
i dont see how they can have it both ways he said 
hundreds of supporters of french a carpenter have turned out 
for rallies throughout the state in addition petitions and letters 
of encouragement have arrived from around the country including one 
from a group of about 40 jewish orthodox believers in the new york 
city borough of brooklyn anderson said 
about 400 people from around the country have contributed 1 each 
to a defense fund for french which includes another 2000 from 
larger contributors anderson said 
all discrimination is not bad anderson said layles 
discriminating against what many people view as immoral 
fornication 
andrea mitau kircher an assistant state attorney general 
countered andersons argument by saying the state university system 
may be subject to different laws than ordinary landlords she also 
said the states fornication law is possibly in violation of the 
state constitution and has been raised unsuccessfully as a defense 
in similar cases 
landlords cant make rental decisions on the basis of marital 
status kircher said 
livinginsin issues are in legal flux elsewhere in the 
united states 
in denver the city council voted 76 in may to revoke a 
livinginsin ordinance that prohibited unmarried people from living 
together 
in massachusetts three couples filed a lawsuit five years ago 
charging they were illegally barred from public housing in worcester 
because they were unmarried state law like the one in minnesota 
prohibits discrimination on the basis of marital status a 
commission and court have ruled in their favor and the case is 
pending before a state appeals court 
in the minnesota case french agreed in february 1988 to rent his 
former house in marshall to sue parsons but he said he quickly 
changed his mind and returned her damage deposit after he decided it 
would be against his religious beliefs parsons had told french she 
would be living with her fiance the two are now married 
french said he is willing to pay the woman 348 in damages she 
sustained by having to change her rental plans but he refuses to 
pay a 700 civil penalty imposed by an administrative law judge who 
ruled june 7 that french violated the states antidiscrimination 
law 
the appeals panel said it would rule within 90 days

election officials guarded polling 
places today during balloting for a national assembly seat in a 
seoul race that is viewed as a test of support for the governing 
party 
there were six candidates including one sponsored by dissident 
groups political analysts said the race was too close to call and 
officials results were not expected until saturday 
the district election management committee already concerned 
with charges of illegal campaigning said today more than 100 
election officials were stationed at polling places to guard against 
violence and election fraud 
president roh taewoo of the democratic justice party sent a 
letter to party members in the district urging support for rha 
woongbae a former deputy prime minister roh called the race a 
litmus test which would determine the course the nation would take 
kim daejung head of the largest opposition party the party for 
peace and democracy said the election was a midterm appraisal of 
the government and predicted voters would side with the opposition 
lee yonghee a threeterm lawmaker is that partys candidate 
the yongdungpo district in southwestern seoul is seen as a 
microcosm of korean political thinking the district includes urban 
middleclass workers and laborers and because many of the voters 
are newcomers to seoul it reflects the regional antagonism in korean 
politics 
in the last election the winning candidate and two opposition 
candidates were within 551 votes of each other election officials 
say there are 168812 registered voters in the district 
todays election was called after the supreme court ruled in may

was null and void because of illegal campaigning kim is not running 
charges of unfair campaigning have been widespread and include 
vote buying distribution of illegal materials slander and illegal 
meetings 
on thursday the central election management committee ruled roh 
violated the law by sending letters to nonparty members asking 
voters to support the democratic justice party candidate 
the other candidates are lee wonbum a former lawmaker from the 
reunification democratic party park sangwoong of the new 
democratic republican party ko youngkoo a lawyer running with 
support from dissident groups and kim hyungjoo an independent

the foreign secretary expressed regret 
over the death of an australian missionary slain in a hostage drama 
and lawmakers today called for an investigation to determine if she 
was shot by troops 
jacqueline hamill 36 of sydney was among five hostages and 16 
convicts who died tuesday before troops recaptured the jail at davao 
city 610 miles south of manila convicts had seized the hostages 
during religious services sunday 
miss hamill arrived in the philippines last month 
we regret she had to lose her life that way foreign 
secretary raul manglapus told reporters she was pursuing a 
vocation which required her to expose her life in extraordinary 
ways under those circumstances of course sometimes it is not 
possible to give full protection we regret that happened 
in sydney officials said philippine president corazon aquino had 
written prime minister bob hawke to express heartfelt sorrow 
over miss hamills murder saying security forces were left with no 
choice after the prison inmates started killing the captives 
mrs aquino also expressed condolences to ms hamills family 
the officials said 
miss hamill bled to death after being shot in the back according 
to philippine officials 
doctors said she apparently had been shot from a distance because 
there were no powder burns on the body this led to speculation that 
she may have been shot by military snipers who returned gunfire when 
convicts tried to escape using their captives as shields 
rep ramon mitra speaker of the house of representatives and 
sen victor ziga of the senate defense committee said they wanted an 
investigation to determine whether miss hamill was shot by soldiers 
thats very crucial ziga said i have not heard of any 
occasion where rescuers shot at prisoners and endangered the lives 
of the hostages 
the australian embassy in manila has also asked for clarification 
of the circumstances of her death 
military chief of staff gen renato de villa has promised the 
armed forces will cooperate

advocates for the homeless say theyre waiting for 
hud secretary jack kemp to back up his rhetoric with cash for 
housing programs 
as kemp spoke thursday to a gathering of the southern christian 
leadership conference his audience gave several standing ovations 
but held to a waitandsee attitude 
we dont think its reasonable or moral to have property 
boarded up while people sleep in the streets and in shelters said 
sclc president joseph lowery while we are waiting weve got to 
utilize whatever funds are available to the best advantage thats 
why we are anxious to work with hud 
kemp delivered a brief address that reiterated his position of 
improving housing for the poor and adopting a gettough stance with 
the scandalridden department of housing and urban development 
but washington homeless advocate mitch snyder responded to kemps 
speech with an attack on the bush administration for swiftly bailing 
out savings and loan associations while ignoring funding needs for 
housing 
i didnt hear a word from mr kemp about money and ive 
been waiting for him and his boss to start talking about money 
snyder said 
snyder said the housing budget proposed by the bush 
administration contained less money for housing than the last 
budget that was introduced by mr reagan 
bushs 1990 budget allows 151 billion for housing compared to 
the 129 billion in the 1989 budget drafted under reagan the 1988 
budget also under reagan allowed 186 billion for housing 
kemp spoke at the sclcs 32nd annual convention about cleaning up 
his department 
i want to clean it out i want to make sure it works for the 
needy not the greedy kemp said were going to make it work 
for the poor again i pledge that to you 
he left soon after the speech for washington 
comedianactivist dick gregory a panelist expressed displeasure 
with kemps speedy departure 
we need to bring kemp not to speak but to listen gregory 
said 
the sclc has placed homelessness atop its national agenda in 
april with the help of snyder and several local homeless advocacy 
groups it seized a boardedup foreclosed atlanta house and cleaned 
it up for use by the homeless 
the sclc then arranged for a florida sampl to sell the house to a

iranian president hashemi rafsanjani 
promised help to free western hostages in lebanon provided the 
united states improves relations with his country and he cited 
frozen iranian assets as one sore point 
i have said many times that if the united states expects us to 
help in the lebanese issue it should show in practice that it has 
dropped its hostile stand against us he told pakistans foreign 
minister after being sworn into office thursday before irans 
parliament 
the official islamic republic news agency quoted foreign minister 
yaqoub khan of pakistan as saying he had been asked to seek irans 
cooperation in freeing the 16 hostages who include eight americans 
most are held by proiranian groups 
rafsanjani indicated it could be some time before there could be 
any accommodation on the hostage issue according to irna monitored 
in nicosia 
if the americans really do have good will it must take a very 
long time before this good will can be proven in practice he said 
rafsanjani said washington had shown hostility toward iran by 
freezing billions of dollars in iranian assets and by supporting 
iraq in its eightyear war with iran 
on sunday irna said iran would use its maximum influence for 
the release of all the hostages if the united states freed 2 
billion in iranian assets the assets were frozen 10 years ago after 
iranians seized the us embassy in tehran and held 52 americans 
hostage for 444 days 
but in what appears to be a continuing power struggle between 
hardliners and pragmatists irans spiritual leader ayatollah ali 
khamenei said monday that there would be no dealings with the 
cursed united states 
at the swearingin thursday rafsanjani pledged to use the 
increased powers of the presidency to avoid political strife but he 
acknowledged that political infighting has undermined efforts to 
form a cabinet 
rafsanjani a middleranking clergyman took over from khamenei 
who was elected the islamic republics supreme spiritual leader 
after the death of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini on june 3 
the new president leads the socalled pragmatists in iran who 
favor improving relations with the west to gain technology and 
financing for rebuilding an economy devastated by the iraniraq war 
the rival radicals headed by interior minister ali akbar 
mohtashemi advocate strict controls on economic and social activity 
and an antiwestern foreign policy to keep the 1979 islamic 
revolution on track 
rafsanjani was sworn in seven weeks early so that he can tackle 
pressing problems that include shortages soaring inflation and 
widespread unemployment 
the western hostage held longest in lebanon is terry anderson 
chief middle east correspondent for the associated press he was 
kidnapped march 16 1985

a target shooters stray bullet as initially reported the us 
forest service said 
the blaze which started july 29 near vail lake in southern

after the fire started but officials continued to cite the

here are sketches of the three candidates 
proposed by solidarity leader lech walesa on thursday for the post 
of prime minister 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
bronislaw geremek in april when solidarity was legalized after 
a sevenyear ban geremek faced a tough decision whether to return 
after years of opposition activity to the academic world of medieval 
studies or continue to serve solidaritys march to democracy as a 
top adviser 
the 57yearold professor fluent in french and proficient in at 
least two other languages chose solidarity 
geremek became a wellknown figure in the opposition in the late 
1970s when he lectured on officially taboo topics of polish history 
and culture in private apartments as part of the socalled flying 
university created in the late 1970s 
he crossed paths with workers during the gdansk strikes in august 
1980 
soon after the strikes broke out geremek and tadeusz mazowiecki 
another solidarity candidate for prime minister rushed north with a 
letter signed by intellectuals urging authorities to find a solution 
without force 
the strikers invited geremek and mazowiecki to stay at the strike 
as their advisers 
the historians life has not been the same since 
he was arrested dec 13 1981 when martiallaw was declared he 
was released a year later and then fired in 1985 from his academic 
job because of his continued role as a solidarity adviser 
geremek was elected a deputy to parliament in the june elections 
and then chosen to lead the solidarity caucus 
he is one of walesas chief representatives in meetings with top 
foreign officials since the union was legalized in april he has 
traveled to west germany and france for meetings with senior 
officials and last week met pope john paul ii in rome

fighters for greater democracy in poland 
the communist party lost the young recruit by expelling him from 
the party eight months after he joined in march 1953 for refusing to 
submit to a required session of selfcriticism 
a historian and teacher kurons 1964 open letter to party 
criticized the communist system for abusing workers for it he 
served three years in prison 
authorities accused him of instigating student demonstrations in 
1968 and kept him in jail for another 3 years 
in 1976 he helped found the committee for the defense of workers 
to help workers fired from their jobs and forced to stand trial 
after worker riots that year 
a tireless pamphleteer kuron seemed born for politics there was 
hardly an important opposition declaration he didnt sign in the 
1970s and in 1980 he became an adviser to strikers in gdansk 
he too was rounded up on the december 1981 night that 
martiallaw was proclaimed 
released in an amnesty in 1984 kuron immediately began holding 
news conferences and issuing reports on the conditions of those 
still in jail 
elected a deputy in the june elections kuron is on the presidium

president corazon aquino today 
threatened to fire her justice secretary and other officials if they 
fail to arrest corrupt government employees tax evaders and other 
big fish criminals by the end of the year 
in a statement addressed to justice secretary sedfrey ordonez 
mrs aquino said her adminstration has failed to enforce laws 
because of a double standard favoring the rich 
nothing impairs the credibility of government more than the 
common perception that we have two standards of justice one for the 
poor and another for the rich and powerful she said in the 
statement released to news media 
we have done nothing to disprove this perception until now we 
have not secured the conviction of that elusive big fish she 
added 
i am now placing all of you under probation she said at 
the end of the year we will assess your performance as individuals 
and a department if i am not satisfied i will not hesitate to 
exercise my power to remove appointees 
mrs aquinos former spokesman teodoro benigno says the 
president knows who the biggest offenders in the government and 
private sector are but has not moved against them because of a lack 
of evidence 
the president will need audacity in dealing with graft and 
corruption benigno wrote recently in the newspaper the philippine 
star and shell have to do away with that tired old cliche that 
she needs proof 
mrs aquino knows who the big grafters are who the big tax 
evaders are who the big smugglers are and i can assure her the 
entire nation will cheer if tomorrow she marches three of them to

an army reserve member who feared he would be 
blamed for the beating death of a palestinian killed himself with a 
burst of machinegun fire israeli news reports said today 
yariv baryosef 25 shot himself in the head with his uzi 
machine gun early thursday the reports said an army spokeswoman 
said she could not comment because the case involving baryosef was 
still under investigation 
also today a new security policy went into effect that requires 
palestinians entering israel to carry computerized identity cards 
palestinians said they would boycott their jobs in israel to protest 
the restriction 
traffic into israel was light from both gaza and the occupied 
west bank but officials blamed this more on friday being the moslem 
prayer day than on the call by uprising leaders for workers to 
boycott jobs in israel 
palestinian reporters said a true test of the boycott would 
probably come sunday when workers from the west bank and gaza strip 
return to israel after the jewish sabbath 
israeli officials say the card system is intended to prevent 
those with criminal or security records from entering israel 
following a series of attacks on jews by arabs 
palestinians argue the system is a further attempt by israel to 
quell the revolt against occupation by putting an economic squeeze 
on gaza where poverty is widespread and few jobs are available 
at least 537 palestinians have been killed in clashes with 
soldiers or other israelis in the 20monthold palestinian uprising 
against israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
ninetyfive other palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs as 
alleged collaborators with israel and 38 israelis also have been 
slain 
baryosef was among soldiers being investigated by military 
police in connection with the aug 22 1988 beating death of hani 
elshami 42 in the gaza strip a military tribunal ruled that the 
death resulted from blows elshami received at the armys jabaliya 
detention following an earlier beating that day by soldiers at his 
home 
four soldiers of the elite givati brigade who are stationed at 
the gaza strips jabiliya refugee camp were acquitted of 
manslaughter and convicted of brutality 
baryosef who was not among those convicted in the earlier 
trial served in a reserve unit as a guard in the detention center 
he testified that he kicked elshami in the shoulder on the day he 
died the daily yediot ahronot said today 
the trial raised a controversy over defense minister yitzhak 
rabins declared policy of beating palestinian demonstrators in an 
effort to halt the uprising against israeli occupation 
shortly after the trial a military judge was appointed to reopen 
the inquiry into elshamis death yediot said baryosef was 
questioned several times since by military police 
according to yediot baryosef said in the suicide note he feared 
he would become the next scapegoat of the givati affair he referred 
to israel as a land that devours its people and expressed fears 
he would be imprisoned 
baryosef a student at jerusalems hebrew university was found 
dead outside governmentowned israel television where he worked 
parttime as a security guard he had been shot in the head with his 
own uzi

cocaine corruption is sweeping across the 
hemisphere with one bahamian official offering to sell traffickers 
every ounce of the drug confiscated in that island nation a senate 
witness says 
in the bahamas it goes all the way to the top convicted 
drug smuggler max mermelstein said thursday testifying from behind 
a screen while six government bodyguards stood by 
the federally protected witness told the senate judiciary 
committee in an electronically disguised voice that before his 1985 
arrest he smuggled up to 55 tons of cocaine into the united states 
as an employee of the boys from colombia 
he has been cooperating with the government and has a price on 
his head that committee chairman joseph biden ddel placed at 3 
million 
biden called the hearing to provide background before the 
administration unveils its comprehensive drugfighting program next 
month 
mermelstein said the united states has been slowed in its moves 
to combat colombian traffickers in part because we deal directly 
with the police and local governments and in south america thats a 
direct line to the cartel 
highranking army officers appear immune to cocaine corruption in 
colombia he said but other officials are either bribed or murdered 
either they take the money or they die he said 
he said the corruption was by no means confined to colombia and 
that he was once offered a deal of so much per kilo for any 
cocaine confiscated by the bahamian government for distribution in 
the united states 
we were setting it up but i was arrested he said 
he said one cartel pilot forced by plane trouble to set down in 
cuba with a load of cocaine was told a 10000 payoff would always 
buy emergency landing privileges 
cocaine kingpins have used billions of narcodollars from us 
sales to follow a globehopping lifestyle with visits to the 
bullfights in mexico and spain as well as the olympic games in 
korea mermelstein said 
in other testimony the commandant of the marine corps gen 
alfred gray told the panel he is skeptical about socalled boot 
camps advocated by some law enforcement officials for young drug 
offenders instead of prison 
i can tell you right up front if you dont provide an 
alternative it will fail he said adding that marine boot camp is 
designed to produce fighting men and not to punish offenders 
its a completely different kind of socialization he said 
he said the center of gravity in fighting drugs in america is 
on the side of stopping demand rather than supply and was critical 
of the idea of a military attack on south american coca fields 
i hope we can have a more balanced and farreaching thought 
process because we live in a more complex world than that and i 
think we all know that he said 
a former assistant us attorney in miami richard gregorie told 
the committee the customs service and the marshals service developed 
a plan to arrest colombian drug kingpin jorge ochoa last fall during 
a trip to caracas venezuela and fly him to the united states for 
trial but the plan was dropped because of state department 
opposition 
ochoa has been indicted by us grand juries several times but 
the colombian supreme court abrogated that countrys extradition 
treaty with the united states two years ago and he cannot be 
arrested by his countrys authorities on a us warrant

ethiopia a proud and historic country now 
under marxist rule could be the prize as the soviet union gradually 
loosens its ties to client states and the united states tries to 
cope with famine and hunger in africa 
the death in an air crash last week of rep mickey leland a 
texas democrat who was a strong friend to ethiopia and anyone 
suffering from hunger touched off a cooperative search that is 
likely to lead to better relations provided two us conditions 
are met 
those conditions as outlined by senior state department 
officials are a continuing improvement in human rights and a 
serious effort by addis ababa to reconcile with separationists in 
ethiopias eritrea region and an autonomous movement in tigray 
there exists a window of opportunity evolving from this 
tragedy said rep gary ackerman dny who served with leland 
on the house select committee on hunger and was in the helicopter 
that spotted the leland planes wreckage 
the soviets have said they are cutting ethiopia off ethiopia 
needs to be adopted and supported by somebody 
on thursday former president carter announced thursday that he 
will serve as a neutral observer when ethiopian officials and 
leaders of a rebel group hold preliminary peace talks next month at 
carters policy center in atlanta ga 
carter said the talks between the government of ethiopia and the 
eritrean peoples liberation front will last for several days and 
will lay the groundwork for further negotiations toward ending the 
ethiopian civil war 
congress prefers the united states not deal with marxistleninist 
governments laws restrict official business with ethiopia and the 
1961 foreign assistance act bars us aid to many comunist 
countries with exceptions 
other laws prohibit us support for international loans to 
countries that systematically violate human rights and bar aid to 
countries that have not paid their debts both of which apply to 
ethiopia 
ethiopia is eligible for humanitarian assistance and during a 
1988 famine the united states provided about 120 million the 
largest outlay to any african country that year 
not one ethiopian died in the drought a us official said 
thursday with evident pride 
us foreign policy is governed by complex considerations and not 
just the political stripe of a country as evidenced by president 
bushs offer of economic development aid to poland and hungary in a 
bid to encourage capitalism in those east european countries 
the fact that there are about 2000 political prisoners in 
ethiopia is considered a much larger obstacle to friendlier us 
relations than the governing marxist philosophy in addis ababa 
ethiopia is the oldest independent country in africa and one of 
the oldest in the world its ties to moscow began with the signing 
of a military assistance agreement in 1976 the next year ethiopia 
scrapped its weapons pact with the united states and soviet arms 
and cuban troops helped ethiopia expel somali forces from the ogaden 
region in 1977 and 1978 
the united states did not break off relations with ethiopia 
which date back to 1903 but its embassies are not headed by 
ambassadors a sign of us distaste for the regime of president 
mengistu haile mariam 
nonetheless uncle sam has been ready with a helping hand 
our major interest is the welfare of the people said a 
senior us official of humanitarian assistance to ethiopia or any 
other marxist country 
there are strategic motivations as well for the gradual 
improvement in relations 
ackerman stressed foreign policy considerations in an interview 
wednesday 
the guerrillas in eritrea and tigray are beating mengistu to 
a pulp ackerman said if ethiopia gets severed you basically 
have arab control of the whole border of the red sea it would be 
giving the region away to the arab world government by 
fundamentalism is a tremendous threat 
therefore the congressman said the bush administration should 
upgrade its relations with mengistu 
he is willing to make concessions to act out of his need for 
survival ackerman concluded 
some state department officials offer a somewhat different 
analysis the eritrean peoples liberation front which has been at 
war with the central government for 27 years is about 50 percent 
christian in background and fundamentalism is not a driving force 
in neighboring somalia 
still ackerman and the state department officials agree that it 
would be good to improve relations 
a friendly and coherent ethiopia would have an effect on its 
neighbors too said a senior us official access to that part 
of the world is important it shouldnt be overstated it is an area 
that is important to be open and not to have doors closed to us

one of them has sued six of the others claiming they arent entitled 
to any of the winnings 
james macieko 42 of bellmore contends in court papers filed 
thursday that he and his fiancee catherine salenga 38 of dix 
hills were the only true winners in the july 12 drawing the 
fifthbiottery history 
he charged that he was intimidated and threatened with the loss 
of the prize money to include the other six all members oggest in state 
lf the 
welsch family of new york in the winning ticket the welsches deny 
the charge 
macieko is the former owner of the liberty card store where the 
winning ticket was purchased he and salenga sold the shop to 
brothers william frank and joseph welsch a year ago 
macieko said he had played lotto at the card shop twice a week 
for the past 10 years using the same numbers 1 4 9 16 24 32 
in court papers macieko contends he had an arrangement with william 
welsch to play those numbers twice a week on his behalf 
during a july 17 news conference to announce jackpot winners 
macieko and salenga the three welsch brothers and three other 
family members said they had been buying tickets as a group everreplied 
that although macieko picked the numbers welsch had 
bought the ticket and that made welsch the winner 
i pleaded with him dont do this to me macieko said in 
court papers welsch then agreed to give macieko and salenga a cut 
of the prize he said 
macieko said that at first he accepted a share of the prize 
because he feared that if i didnt accept the offer as proposed i 
would get nothing but in his suit he argues that he and his 
fiancee should get the whole amount 
the welsches denied any wrongdoing saying that the story told at 
the news conference is the true one 
macieko is a greedy sob said frank welsch those two 
are trying to horn in and get a greater part of the share 
the first of 20 yearly prize checks was to be sent this week but 
the court ordered the distribution of the money postponed while the 
case is pending

these declarations which are a gross interference in internal 
affairs of czechoslovakia and categorically rejects them

national assembly said the sovietled invasion violated every 
nations inalienable right to selfdetermination and its natural 
desire for democracy freedom and respect of human rights

leadership does not concur with the 1968 military intervention 
in czechoslovakia but that assessing the event should be the 
right and task of the czechoslovak people and the czechoslovak 
communist party 
the 1968 invasion crushed a shortlived liberalization period 
spearheaded by then communist party leader alexander dubcek who was 
ousted in april 1969 
communist east germany meanwhile strongly defended the invasion 
new germany the east german communist party daily newspaper 
claimed that the united states and west germany led imperialist 
forces trying to influence czechoslovak affairs in the days before

china has scrapped plans to mark its 40th national 
day with a military parade according to official reports in an 
apparent move to avoid reminding people of the crackdown on the 
prodemocracy movement 
in another development chinese sources said president yang 
shangkun a central figure in the june crackdown had ordered the 
defense minister and several commanders detained to strengthen his 
control of the military 
national day marks the establishment of communist rule in china 
this years celebrations scheduled for oct 1 were to have been 
the most elaborate in five years 
military reviews held annually from 1949 to 1959 were suspended 
for 25 years when they were revived in 1984 the reviews were to 
have been part of national day celebrations every five years 
but beijing mayor chen xitong said thursday no parade was planned 
this year he gave no reason but his decision came two months after 
the government dispatched troops and tanks to crush the sevenweek 
democracy movement 
beijing has been under martial law since may 20 and troops armed 
with assault rifles have guarded the city since the crackdown began 
june 34 
the government says 200 people were killed when soldiers marched 
on beijing chinese witnesses and western intelligence reports say 
up to 3000 people died 
chen said national day flower displays will be set up again this 
year in tiananmen square the site of the studentled prodemocracy 
demonstrations but that only organized groups would be allowed in 
fireworks parties sports events and theatrical performances are 
planned at parks gymnasiums and theaters throughout the city he 
said 
in 1984 beijing celebrated national day with a day of 
festivities in the square including a 1200piece military band 18 
formations of foot soldiers and 24 formations of military equipment 
including antitank missiles rocket minelaying vehicles and 
artillery a civilian parade included 140000 people 
in the military power struggle soldiers loyal to yang went to 
the beijing residence of defense minister qin jiwei on wednesday and 
took him and one of his armed guards away said the chinese sources 
who demanded anonymity 
the sources contacted the associated press separately one is a 
military officer who telephoned hong kong thursday morning from 
beijing and the other is a businessman based in hong kong who 
says he has extensive contacts within the chinese military 
a defense ministry official said today he knew nothing about the 
reports other offices in the defense ministry did not answer their 
telephones today 
qin and yang have been competing to become first vice chairman of 
the central military commission chinas top military body the post 
was left vacant by the dismissal of zhao ziyang on june 24 after he 
expressed sympathy for the prodemocracy demonstrators 
other troops detained the heads of the beijing guangzhou and 
nanjing military districts who supported qin the sources said

the soviet press has published letters leon trotsky 
wrote more than 60 years ago criticizing the communist party the 
latest step toward improving the image of the late party leader 
in its august edition the monthly youth journal molodoi 
kommunist published several letters trotsky wrote in the 1920s 
complaining about the party bureaucracy 
there is a tendency toward a greater and greater contradiction 
between a few thousand people in command and the rest of the party 
members trotsky wrote in a 1923 letter that appeared in pravda 
that year 
the criticism is particularly relevant now as the party tries to 
halt a loss of prestige and faith among the citizenry president 
mikhail s gorbachev has called for a renewal of the 20 
millionmember party 
as trotsky did a halfcentury ago many soviets now blame the 
party bureaucracy for impeding reform 
because of that criticism and other differences dictator josef 
stalin ordered trotsky ousted from the party in 1927 and exiled him 
two years later stalin had his foe killed in mexico in 1940 
trotsky was close to soviet founder vladimir i lenin and helped 
direct the 1917 coup that brought the bolsheviks to power he was 
branded an enemy when stalin took over 
in november 1987 gorbachev became the first soviet leader in 
decades to mention trotsky publicly but condemned his call for world 
revolution since then pravda has published an article 
acknowledging the key role trotsky played in the russian revolution 
and civil war 
officials have so far taken the stance that trotskys views were 
wrong and his full rehabilitation soon is unlikely 
in the letters reprinted in molodoi kommunist trotsky said 
democracy was impossible to achieve in the soviet union but at the 
same time absolute centralism is incompatible with the nature of 
the mass party

president bush took an ocean spin in 
his speed boat today as he interspersed relaxation with updates on 
political developments in poland 
under bright sunny skies the president went by car to nearby 
biddeford where the power boat fidelity was tied up in a yacht 
harbor accompanied by local fishing buddy bob boilard sons george 
and neil and the wife of his other son marvin the president sped 
out to sea trailed by secret service agents in other boats 
he cheerily waved off reporters attempts to engage him in 
conversation photo op he said referring to his rule about not 
answering questions at occasions where he wants to be photographed 
only 
bush on thursday vowed to play golf every day until returning to 
washington on sept 4 
officials said the president was monitoring the moves that could 
lead to a noncommunist government in poland but wasnt directly 
involved in phone conversations with polish or other east bloc 
leaders 
on the first full day of his threeweek vacation bush passed up 
an opportunity to respond directly to news that polish president 
wojciech jaruzelski had approved solidarity leader lech walesas 
plan for a coalition government 
however administration officials privately were enthusiastic 
bush was on the golf course when reporters asked his reaction to 
the developments in poland 
no comment he replied 
but the president was in a jovial mood as he raced around the 18 
holes of a local course with his son george w bush of texas and 
club pro ken raynor 
when reporters ran into a blank wall on the poland issue they 
asked how his vacation was going 
now were talking the president replied 
vowing that he would play golf every day before he returns to 
washington bush joked to the accompanying pool of reporters you 
guys mind coming with us 
bush was surrounded at kennebunkport by numerous offspring and 
grandchildren as well as his wife barbara at the family home on 
walkers point 
he went boating on the ocean and played tennis under 
pictureperfect bright sunny skies 
bush and his advisers were said to be pleased at the apparent 
trend in poland but were choosing their words cautiously 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the 
administration didnt want to upset the apple cart 
bush was briefed on the polish developments by deputy national 
security adviser robert gates who accompanied him to kennebunkport 
two years ago no one in the united states would have predicted 
this could happen said a senior administration official who spoke 
on condition of anonymity of course were happy extremely 
happy 
fitzwater said bush who voiced strong support for recent 
political reforms during his trip to poland last month was not 
endorsing walesa or any other candidate 
it is a sensitive situation there in terms of the general 
movement away from the communist control fitzwater said 
bush and walesa discussed the possibility of walesa becoming 
prime minister when the two had lunch in gdansk last month 
fitzwater said 
walesa has voiced reservations this week about accepting the post 
bush and walesa talked about the political process and the 
prospects and about lech walesas personal feelings about his 
role fitzwater said 
the president understands the various pressures that are on mr 
walesa and he walesa is very concerned about the new government 
about solidaritys ability to step in and take over the new

poles are excited by stunning changes that 
could lead to a noncommunist government nearly eight years after a 
martial law crackdown and they hope the transition will revive the 
nations collapsing economy 
even in june when the freest polish elections in 40 years were 
held it would have been hard to believe the independent solidarity 
movement would do so well that it would force the first 
noncommunist government in the east bloc 
a 20yearold catholic university student said she was surprised 
at the historic changes that took place during her vacation the last 
two weeks 
i didnt expect all this when going for a holiday she said 
thursday 
the elections were only two months ago but the abundance 
of events is so great out of proportion to the calendar added a 
middleage man who was out with his dog 
the young womans homecoming and the mans evening walk were the 
routine events of a day during which the seemingly inconceivable had 
occurred 
president wojciech jaruzelski a communist was reported thursday 
to have agreed to nominate a prime minister from solidarity the 
trade union he sought to crush with martial law in 1981 a 
government official today said jaruzelskis choice was tadeusz 
mazowiecki a journalist and longtime solidarity activist 
the continuing influence of the opposition union had shown the 
world that the course of communism could be challenged albeit as 
much from the pressure of a national economic crisis as from 
arguments about democracy 
for the first time in the east bloc the communists appear to be 
on the verge of turning over the power to form a government 
now those who were under the wagon are on it solidarity 
leader lech walesa told the west german zdf television network after 
his historic meeting with jaruzelski thursday 
but in warsaws streets during the sultry summer evening 
surprise was tempered by a nearly exhausted faith in government 
the point is not who it is going to be as long as it is a 
person who pulls us out from the pit said a middleage bookstore 
worker waiting for the tram home 
we want people who would care for the good of the country we 
dont care whether it is solidarity the communist party or some 
other the point is to get us out of this pit said a retired 
teacher a halfmile away at the central train station 
his daughterinlaw spoke for others absorbed in dealing with 
daily difficulties posed by inflation and shortages 
one leads such a monotonous way of life home work family 
children lines that one does not have time to be interested in 
politics she said 
but she added i think this is a great prospect of something 
new

scientists smashed an f4 phantom jet 
into a concrete barrier to try to estimate what would happen if a 
plane crashed into a nuclear reactor 
researchers at the sandia national laboratories said they hope 
the information gathered from the 1988 test could help prevent a 
nuclear disaster 
the crash data are going to give us an unprecedented ability to 
predict the impact force when an aircraft crashes into a building 
said walter a von riesemann supervisor of sandias containment 
technology division wed previously done some fairly accurate 
computer analysis but the computer models were untried on the real 
thing not anymore 
the test was conducted at the labs rocket sled facility just 
south of albuquerque in april 1988 the rocketpropelled f4 smashed 
headon into a 1 millionpound concrete barrier it shattered when 
it hit the 23footsquare 12footthick reinforced concrete block 
at 480 mph 
details of the test were reported thursday during the 10th 
international conference on structural mechanics in reactor 
technology at anaheim calif sandia officials said 
researchers need to estimate in detail the structural response of 
a building if an airplane crashed or was rammed into it to do that 
they must know how the impact force changes throughout the brief 
time the crash is in progress sandia officials said 
in the past engineers estimated the force of aircraft impacts by 
analyzing the durability and mass of aircraft then calculating how 
much force a plane might exert on a building 
the f4 test showed that computer calculations were fairly 
accurate although they tended to overestimate the force of impact 
von riesemann said 
the plane filled with more than 1200 gallons of water to 
simulate the weight of fuel was shot along rails by a twostage 
rocket it was held in a special carriage to prevent it from taking 
off as it hurtled forward into the barrier 
the crash was recorded by 16 highspeed cameras that shot from 
500 to 2000 frames per second and by meters that measured the 
impact 
the test was paid for by the muto institute of structural 
mechanics inc of tokyo and was performed at sandia under a joint 
united statesjapanese agreement for cooperation on nuclear safety 
engineering and research 
the test was not announced until thursday at the request of the 
japanese sponsors lab officials said

a leader of the 1968 czechoslovak 
reformist movement said today that polands political situation is 
changing so quickly it could get out of control and threaten east 
bloc reforms 
zdenek mlynar made his comments on austrian state radio after 
reports that polands president wojciech jaruzelski had agreed to 
name a representative of the solidarity trade union to lead the east 
blocs first noncommunist government 
mlynar lauded the recent decisions in poland as opening a new 
stage in the reform development in the soviet bloc but said they 
hold a potentially dangerous development 
here you come close to the limit of what moscows reform 
politics can still tolerate he said 
in 1968 mlynar was a communist party central committee secretary 
in prague and a close associate of the party chief alexander 
dubcek dubcek who supported the prague spring reform movement was 
ousted after a sovietled invasion crushed the movement 
mlynar is now an austrian citizen and works as a political 
scientist he frequently has acted as a political analyst of 
developments in eastern europe 
he said the situation in poland might get out of control and grow 
into a foreign policy problem not only for moscow but also for 
the west for european politics as a whole 
this is why one has to make sure that the polish development 
does not threaten the basic direction of the new soviet foreign 
policy mlynar said 
what might get out of control is above all the 
dissatisfaction of the masses mlynar said in the interview 
he suggested that failure to improve the economy in poland might 
result in problems the solidarity government would be unable to 
control

the only passenger vessel that serves the 
christian heartland came under syrian fire at the port of jounieh 
north of beirut today and fled back to its home port in cyprus 
police said 
police said three people were killed and 21 wounded in artillery 
duels between army commander gen michel aouns 20000 predominantly 
christian troops and the more than 40000 syrian and allied forces 
the incidents came during a fragile lull in fighting following a 
tuesday appeal for a ceasefire by the un security council 
in baghdad the iraqi capital president saddam hussein king 
hussein of jordan and palestine liberation organization chairman 
yasser arafat planned to meet to discuss renewing arab efforts to 
bring peace to lebanon 
a police spokesman who cannot be identified in line with 
standing regulations said syrian gunners fired about 120 rockets 
from multibarreled launchers at the hydrofoil santa maria in 
jounieh 12 miles north of beirut 
police said seven passengers waiting to board the ship were 
wounded during the shelling 
in the cypriot port of larnaca a spokesman for the ships agents 
said the vessels crew was unable to unload the baggage of the 120 
passengers who went to lebanon 
the heavy shelling meant the boat had to leave immediately 
said spokesman tony mansour 
for the past three months the santa maria has been the only 
passenger vessel connecting the 310squaremile beleaguered 
christian enclave northeast of beirut with the outside world in 
may slower passenger ferry operators decided it was too dangerous 
to continue sailing to jounieh 
by police count the 5monthold confrontation between christian 
and moslem forces has killed 778 people and wounded 2092 all but 
150000 of beiruts 15 million residents have fled the bombravaged 
city 
iraqi officials said the meeting in baghdad was called to revive 
faltering arab mediation to end the fighting and find a settlement 
to lebanons 14yearold civil war 
the current round of fighting broke out march 8 after aoun 
blockaded illegal ports operated by syrias militia allies south of 
beirut in an abortive bid to restore state authority 
syria and its allies retaliated by besieging the christian 
enclave where about 1 million people live 
iraq syrias main arab rival has been arming aouns forces to 
thwart syrian ambitions in lebanon the syrians say lebanon is vital 
to their security and have long considered it part of greater 
syria 
iraq has supported aouns demand the syrians withdraw the 40000 
troops they have in lebanon under a 1976 arab league peacekeeping 
mandate aoun says the syrians have betrayed that mandate by 
fighting alongside the moslems 
arafat has been feuding with syrian president hafez assad since 
1983 over control of the palestinian cause jordan which reconciled 
with syria two years ago after a lengthy rift is allied with iraq 
in the arab cooperation council 
meanwhile french envoy alain decaux held talks with aoun in the 
generals bunker under the shellbattered presidential palace in 
suburban baabda east of beirut 
decaux who arrived in lebanon thursday refused to talk to 
reporters about his mission 
france which ruled lebanon until 1943 and has long been seen by 
the christians as their main protector has begun a new diplomatic

rep dan rostenkowski was booed and followed down 
the street by a pack of screaming senior citizens as he left a 
meeting with community leaders opposed to his stance on federal 
health insurance 
several dozen people shouted liar impeach and 
recall thursday when the democratic chairman of the house ways 
and means committee left a community center in the northwest side 
chicago district that for 30 years has sent him to congress 
the group followed him down the street and briefly blocked his 
car hitting it with picket signs and pounding on the windows 
rostenkowski got out of the car and briskly walked about a block 
with the seniors in pursuit until the driver brought the car to a 
gas station and the congressman was able to get back in 
the car sped away with its tires screeching 
as he walked down the street rostenkowski said i dont think 
they understand whats going on thats too bad 
the incident occurred after rostenkowski discussed his support 
for the catastrophic health care law during a private 90minute 
meeting with representatives of six senior citizens organizations 
the law set up a supplemental insurance medical plan for senior 
citizens and has triggered objections because it requires seniors to 
pay a surtax on their income taxes for the coverage 
in response to complaints rostenkowskis committee last month 
approved revisions in the program that would reduce the surtax for 
many of the elderly but would increase it for some lowerincome 
elderly 
rostenkowski refused to stop and talk to a larger group of people 
after the meeting because he felt many of them just wanted to vent 
their frustration not talk about the issues an aide said 
they were just going to boo him the aide said 
the congressman left the meeting and made his way through 200 
people outside the private meeting room some followed him to the 
street 
talk to us talk to us you work for us they yelled 
jerry prete president of the illinois state council of senior 
citizens said the meeting with senior representatives idnt go 
well either 
he said rostenkowski wasnt receptive to suggestions made during 
the session 
we think this man is inhumane said lawrence dobson 67 who 
was part of the gathering outside the building hes not answering 
the questions or needs of the people is he afraid of senior 
citizens 
the catastrophic coverage law requires most of the elderly to pay 
a surtax on their income taxes for coverage it was intended as a 
way of shielding the elderly from the rocketing medical bills of a 
major illness but opponents complain that it requires middleincome 
retirees to pay unusually high tax rates 
if the ways and means committee proposals to revise the program 
are approved by congress and the president the surtax would be 
reduced for many elderly taxpayers but for an elderly couple with 
an income of 15000 to 20000 the annual cost for catastrophic 
insurance would go up 
prete said members of his group believe they should not have to 
pay any premium arguing that farmers get bailouts savings and

president bush is not considering expanding the 
119 million economic aid package he has proposed for poland despite 
the noncommunist government taking shape in the east bloc nation 
his spokesman said today 
asked in kennebunkport maine where bush is vacationing whether 
the changes in poland would justify more financial incentives 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater told reporters its 
really premature to think along those lines 
he also said he administration would have no comment on reports 
of the selection of tadeusz mazowiecki editor of the newspaper of 
the independent trade union solidarity as the new prime minister 
until the parliamentary process is completed and the new leaders are 
ratified 
the situation is changing rapidly there fitzwater said we 
would prefer not to have any further comment on the process until we 
have some assurances on how the government is going to be formed 
meeting last month with bush in poland solidarity chairman lech 
welesa asked for 10 billion in us aid to rebuild the polish 
economy which is saddled with a 39 billion debt to western 
governments and banks 
bush responded with the 119 million package that will include 
100 million over three years for loans to poles trying to start 
capitalist enterprises 5 million to clean pollution in krakow and 
4 million to be spent through the us labor department to study 
social and work issues in poland 
labor secretary elizabeth dole and her husband senate republican 
leader bob dole left washington today on a 10day trip that wil 
include meetings with officials in poland next week 
sen dole said i think right now its a time of great 
excitement and expectations but i do believe that if you look at it 
realistically there are some tough days ahead 
state department spokesman richard boucher said thursday that the 
administration was still drafting proposed legislation on the 
presidents aid package for presentation to congress when it returns 
from recess next month 
fitzwater on thursday described the political change in poland as 
a sensitive situation there in terms of the general movement away 
from the communist control 
bush does not want to do anything or say anything to upset the 
apple cart were very reluctant to involve ourselves in a more 
direct fashion he said 
certainly a noncommunist government would be a remarkable and 
historymaking occurrence fitzwater said 
but one senior administration official described the mood as 
jubilant 
two years ago no one in the united states would have predicted 
this could happen of course were happy extremely happy said 
the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
these changes are the most important upheavals in eastern 
europe and in the soviet world since the death of stalin zbigniew 
brzezinski a native of poland who was former president carters 
national security adviser said today on cbs this morning and 
they have enormous implications for the future of communism and the 
eastwest relations we are seeing the end of an entire era 
state department spokesman boucher issued a statement clearly 
designed to warn the kremlin not to invoke the brezhnev doctrine 
used in the past to justify the use of force to prevent assertion of 
greater independence by poland czechoslovakia and hungary 
poland faces a difficult period of transition from a state 
dominated by one party to a more pluralistic and democratic system 
the process must be managed within poland boucher said 
we emphasize that this continues to be a matter for the polish 
people to decide he said 
asked whether his statement was aimed at moscow boucher would 
say only you know as well as i do what the history of poland is 
one specialist on soviet affairs predicted gorbachev would grin 
and bear the formation of a noncommunist government in poland 
unless he chose to jeopardize his own reforms and efforts to improve 
relations with the west 
the test of how far gorbachev is willing to let things go in 
eastern europe has come earlier than anyone expected said leon 
aron a scholar of soviet affairs at the conservative heritage 
foundation in washington 
but as long walesa does not humiliate polands communists or try 
to withdraw from the kremlinled warsaw pact military alliance 
gorbachev may have to grin and bear it aron said 
gorbachev also realizes that any attempt at stopping these 
developments in poland would mean violence major threat to 
eastwest relations and ultimately probably he would dig his own 
grave within the soviet union said brzezinski 
polish emigres were less confident 
it seems to be too good to be true said zdislaw rurarz who 
defected from his post as polish ambassador to tokyo when communist 
authorities declared martial law and suppressed solidarity on dec 
13 1981 
i cannot imagine that the ussr has abandoned poland and is 
ready to end its domination of that country rurarz said in a 
telephone interview 
all depends on the reaction from moscow said jan nowak an 
emigre pole who fought the nazis and the communists for control of 
poland before fleeing his homeland after world war ii

highly successful trials of the antiviral drug 
azt suggest that aids may soon become a treatable disease 
instead of a hopeless infection federal officials say 
the announcement is a major turning point in the aids 
epidemic said jean mcguire director of the aids action council 
an advocacy group for aids patients 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan announced 
thursday that trials of azt on one group of patients who have the 
aids virus but no symptoms proved that the drug can halt 
progression of the infection 
we are indeed entering the period when aids may become a 
treatable disease sullivan said at a news conference where the 
azt drug trial results were announced 
however he cautioned azt is not a cure and indeed even 
those who are under azt treatment remain capable of transmitting the 
disease 
findings of the drug trials on earlyinfected patients who show 
no symptoms prompted federal officials to stop the trials so that 
all participants can receive azt the drug trial had required 
onethird of the 1300 in the study to receive a placebo or sugar 
pill 
patients in the trial were in the early stages of infection by 
the human immunedeficiency virus or hiv that causes aids 
in effect they were feeling well and were symptomfree but they 
had a damaged immune system as measured by the numbers of t4 
lymphocytes a type of immune cells in the blood an azt trial 
continues for patients in an even earlier stage of infection and 
with even less immune system damage 
azt also known as zidovudine is marketed by burroughs wellcome 
co under the brand name retrovir it formally was known by the name 
azidothymidine which was shortened in popular use to azt 
thursdays announcement marks the third time that formal trials 
of azt have been modified after the drug demonstrated its 
effectiveness against aids in selected patient groups 
two weeks ago a trial was stopped among patients with a stage of 
the disease called aidsrelated complex or arc earlier the 
government halted trials among profoundly infected aids patients in 
both cases the trials were stopped so that those participants 
getting placebo could start receiving the drug 
an azt trial continues among aids patients whose blood immune 
system is still healthy but who test positive for infection by the 
human immunodeficiency virus or hiv which causes aids this group 
would be at an even earlier stage of the disease 
sullivan said the new trial results along with those from the 
two earlier trials provide real hope for the millions of people 
worldwide who are infected with hiv 
ms mcguire said in a prepared statement for the millions of 
americans who have waited to be tested for hiv because there was no 
medical assistance available todays announcement should be reason 
for people to rethink that decision 
the hhs secretary said he is ordering that medicare patients 
receiving azt be reimbursed for the cost of the drug azt which 
must be taken six times daily costs 7000 to 8000 a year per 
patient 
dr anthony fauci director of the national institute of allergy 
and infectious diseases the lead federal clinical agency in 
fighting aids said that with thursdays announcement about 400000 
more patients may be prescribed azt even though the drug is not 
approved by the food and drug administration for use among mildly 
infected patients it could be prescribed for such patients at 
doctors discretion he said 
the earlier trials opened use of the drug to about 200000 
patients making a total of 600000 who may now take azt fauci said 
sullivan said the fda will consider the new drug trial results 
and may modify the approved uses of azt to include those mildly 
infected this action however could take months he said 
in the study concluded thursday onethird of the patients 
received 1500 milligrams daily of azt a third took 500 mg daily 
and a third got sugar pills the study was conducted at 32 centers 
in 16 states and the district of columbia 
fauci said the results showed that among those taking the 
placebo 38 patients developed symptoms of aids or of arc among 
those on high doses of azt 19 developed the disease symptoms and 
among those on the low doses 17 developed symptoms 
this is a very important step in the scientific certification 
of what we had been hoping for fauci said were not talking 
about a cure but were talking about a very important step in 
delaying the progression of the disease 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the bodys immune 
system and renders it incapable of protecting against infection the 
disease is caused by the hiv virus and is spread most frequently 
through sexual contact the sharing of needles and syringes and 
from mother to newborn infant 
new figures released thursday by the centers for disease control 
show there have been 102621 cases of aids diagnosed in the united 
states since 1981 a total of 59391 us patients have died 
there is no cure for aids and no one is known to have recovered 
completely from the viral infection

president wojciech jaruzelski has chosen 
solidarity activist tadeusz mazowiecki to be the new prime minister 
and lead the east blocs first noncommunist government a 
government source said today 
i can expect such an offer i am ready to accept it 
mazowiecki told reporters after meeting with jaruzelski this morning 
a highly placed state official said that during the meeting 
jaruzelski chose mazowiecki from three solidaritybacked candidates 
and would offer him the prime ministers post the sejm or 
parliament where a solidaritybacked alliance has a firm majority 
must approve jaruzelskis choice 
mazowiecki 62 whose name is pronounced mahzohveeetskee is 
a journalist who spent time in jail for his antigovernment 
activities he refused to give details of his meeting with the 
president saying only that it concerned all important topics 
there are huge troubles huge problems it wont be easy 
mazowiecki said of the prime ministers post i am afraid of many 
things but if i were only afraid i would be a total pessimist 
somebody has to try it 
the new government will be the first noncommunist government in 
poland in 45 years and inherits an economy wracked by inflation 
shortages and a 39 billion foreign debt 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said today president bush 
was not considering increasing the 119 million economic aid package 
proposed for poland despite the noncommunist government taking 
shape fitzwater said the bush administration would not comment on 
the new prime minister until the nomination was ratified 
there was no immediate comment from the soviet union which has 
expressed concern about the changes in poland but promised not to 
interfere 
the polish government official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said a formal announcement on jaruzelskis choice would 
be made saturday the communist party central committee also is 
scheduled to meet saturday 
mazowiecki is editor of the solidarity weekly newspaper tygodnik 
solidarnosc the other candidates recommended by solidarity were 
jacek kuron a solidarity lawmaker and bronislaw geremek 
solidaritys parliamentary leader 
the once inconceivable idea of a government without a communist 
party member at the helm became possible after solidarity leader 
lech walesa persuaded two small parties that hold the balance of 
power in the sejm to join solidarity in a coalition 
that resulted in the communist alliance losing its majority in 
the sejm 
on thursday the communist prime minister gen czeslaw kiszczak 
resigned after trying two weeks to form a government 
the same day jaruzelski met with walesa reportedly agreed to 
the coalition idea and agreed to pick a member of the trade union he 
once outlawed to lead it 
walesa who in april realized his goal of reviving solidarity 
after a sevenyear ban had said he did not want the job 
even in a government led by solidarity jaruzelski will remain 
president controlling the army and foreign affairs local 
governments will still be in the hands of the communist party and 
party members will control the courts in addition tens of 
thousands of polands bureaucrats owe their jobs to the party and 
75 percent of management jobs ranging from shop managers to 
factory heads are held by party members 
mazowiecki was the least known of the candidates put forward by 
walesa but his relation to solidarity dates to the first days of 
the august 1980 strikes in gdansk that gave birth to the trade union 
he organized a petition of support among intellectuals for the 
strikers than stayed on with the workers as an adviser 
mazowiecki was at walesas side last year when a wave of strikes 
began and led to governmentopposition talks on democratic reforms 
those talks ended in solidarity being legalized again and led to 
polands most democratic elections which allowed solidarity to 
enter government 
in the june vote solidaritybacked candidates swept all but one 
seat available to the opposition in the sejm and newly formed 
senate the accord guaranteed the communist party a majority but it 
lost the upper hand when its traditional allies the democratic and 
united peasant parties defected to solidarity this week 
in an apparent effort to reassure polands warsaw pact allies 
walesa thursday reiterated his view that polands membership in the 
sovietled alliance was not in jeopardy 
under his proposal the communists should retain control of the 
defense and interior ministries which oversee the army and police 
we are members of the warsaw pact and therefore have certain 
responsibilities he told west german television 
back in 1980 the creation of solidarity the soviet blocs first 
independent trade union unnerved the soviet union then ruled by 
communist party leader leonid brezhnev 
the union was legal for 16 months and had swelled to 10 million 
members when martial law was declared dec 13 1981 thousands of 
union supporters were jailed and parliament banned solidarity the 
next year 
before solidarity mazowiecki was active in independent catholic 
circles helped found the club of catholic intelligentsia in warsaw 
in 1957 
he was part of the znak group which managed under church 
protection to serve as a focal point for thinking independent of 
communist ideology in poland in the 1960s and 1970s the group was 
permitted a few seats in parliament and mazowiecki held one from 
1961 to 1971 
mazowiecki was editor of the catholic literary and political 
monthly wiez from 1958 until 1981 when he founded tygodnik 
solidarnosc the weekly was banned after martial law but mazowiecki 
resurrected it this year

the agriculture department said friday it is 
expanding its recent ban on ostrich imports to include related 
flightless birds such as emus rheas and cassowaries because they 
may carry diseasebearing parasites 
larry b slagle acting administrator of the departments animal 
and plant health inspection service said the expanded import ban 
was effective immediately and would remain indefinitely 
we must curtail the entry of flightless birds into the united 
states until further notice to ensure that these birds do not 
introduce diseasecarrying parasites to us livestock he said 
the flightless birds affected by the ban are known as ratites and 
include ostriches emus rheas and cassowaries these birds have 
only small or rudimentary wings 
an agency spokeswoman marlene stinson said the import ban does 
not apply to penguins because those are of a different family 
neither will the ban affect kiwis because the birds homeland new 
zealand does not permit exports she said 
interest in ostrich farming has grown rapidly and so have 
imports stinson said no ostriches were imported in 1986 but that 
348 entered the united states in 1987 537 in 1988 and 825 through 
july 31 of this year 
at present sales of chicks and adult ostriches are confined 
primarily to other breeders who envision a potential market for 
ostrich hide and meat 
slagle said the crackdown on imports was prompted by the 
discovery earlier this year of 18 exotic ticks on adult ostriches in 
ohio oklahoma and texas 
the ticks were identified as african bont and bontlegged ticks 
which are known to transmit heartwater an often fatal disease of 
cattle sheep goats and other ruminants no further tick findings 
have been reported 
slagle said the disease does not affect humans and does not exist 
in the united states 
on july 5 the usda agency announced it had stopped issuing 
import permits for ostriches as a result of the tick threat and was 
reviewing import inspection methods and quarantine standards 
slagle said the official rulemaking publication of the new 
import curbs will be aug 21 public comments can be sent by oct 20

black employees outside a pie factory where they had been locked out 
by management at least 15 workers were injured police and union 
officials said 
police also arrested an antiapartheid activist and banned a cape 
town rally called for sunday by outlawed rights organizations 
in another development trevor tutu son of nobel prizewinning 
archbishop desmond tutu was sentenced today to 18 months in prison 
for allegedly making a false bomb threat at johannesburgs 
international airport 
mohammed valli moosa an official of the banned united democratic 
front and a leader of a new campaign to defy apartheid restrictions 
was arrested at his johannesburg office today and held there as 
security police searched his files 
police ordered journalists from the building after the reporters 
saw valli moosa in custody and were told he was under arrest 
there was no immediate indication what charges might be filed 
against valli moosa one of three activists who escaped from 
detention last year and took sanctuary at the us consulate in 
johannesburg 
another escapee murphy morobe said valli moosas arrest 
violated the governments promise that the three were free to leave 
the consulate without fear of being arrested again 
it shows how easy it is for the government to go back on its 
word said morobe who called on the us government to condemn 
the arrest 
the food and allied workers union said scores of workers 
assembled early today outside the mamas pies factory on 
johannesburgs southeastern outskirts a day after the company 
locked them out because of a 4weekold wage dispute 
the union said police used whips and live ammunition to disperse 
the workers and made several arrests the union said 15 workers were 
injured some seriously 
capt reg crewe a spokesman at police headquarters in pretoria 
said police acted only after workers began pulling on the locked 
factory gates and ingored an order to disperse he said officers 
initially used whips but fired shotguns when some fleeing workers 
threw stones 
he said four people were slightly injured by the shotgun fire and 
15 others suffered minor injuries while being dispersed he said no 
one was arrested 
it was the second violent labor clash in two days 
on thursday police said at least 10 people were injured outside 
the britishowned eveready plant in port elizabeth in clashes 
between striking workers and people recruited to fill their jobs 
crewe asked about the banned cape town rally said he did not 
know if similar rallies planned for sunday in other cities also 
would be banned 
desmond tutu said the ban was inflammatory and dangerous and 
called for an alternative rally at his church in cape town 
tutus 32yearold son trevor was convicted of violating the 
aviation act by falsely telling police that there was a bomb in his 
luggage he had pleaded innocent and said he would appeal the 
conviction 
shortly after the dec 31 incident at jan smuts airport trevor 
tutu convened a news conference and told reporters he deliberately 
courted arrest as part of a publicity stunt on behalf of his 
advertising agency 
he also was convicted on three counts of criminal injury and 
fined 440 for allegedly interfering with police last year when they 
tried to arrest a friend of his on suspicion of drunken driving 
in 1984 trevor tutu was held by police for three days before he 
was cleared of a charge of drunken driving in 1985 he was briefly 
detained after arguing with police at a courthouse about the 
detention of black children 
tutus father is leader of the anglican church in southern africa 
and one of the countrys most prominent antiapartheid activists 
there was no immediate comment from the archbishop about his sons

the united democratic front a nationwide coalition of activist 
organizations and 16 other antiapartheid groups last year were 
ordered to halt all activities they intended to declare themselves 
legal on sunday the fronts sixth anniversary

arrested immediately by south korean authorities the command said 
they crossed the border at panmunjom without proper authorization 
south korea accused north korea of intentional provocation 
and using panmunjom for propaganda purposes 
in its statement the un command also said north korea had 
brought hundreds of people to the demilitarized zone for 
demonstrations in july and august against the united states and 
south korea 
the north deliberately altered the rules thus introducing 
uncertainty and raising tensions in a sensitive area where the 
potential for confrontation and violence is always high it said 
north korea denied the crossing was illegal it said the 
armistice agreement applied only to foreigners or people wishing to 
enter the territory under control of the other side and it is 
natural for ms im and moon to go back to their residence area 
the un command says any person military or civilian who 
crosses the border must have specific authoritization from the 
military armistice commission that supervises implementation of the 
agreement 
it pointed out that many koreans from both sides had crossed in 
the past by mutual agreement but that south korea had not given 
permission for the dissidents to do so

the state board of pardons today rejected a 
plea for clemency from convicted hifi murderer william andrews 
scheduled to die by injection early tuesday after nearly 15 years on 
death row 
the boards 21 decision left the nations longeststanding 
resident of death row with pending appeals in state and federal 
courts of his 1974 conviction for torturing and murdering three 
people during a stereo store robbery in ogden 
in all five people were forced to drink caustic drain cleaner 
and were then shot in the head two survived the august 1974 attack 
board chairman hl haun and panel member edward kimball decided 
that although andrews did not shoot the victims his help in forcing 
them to drink the drain cleaner and his knowledge that codefendant 
pierre dale selby intended to kill them made commutation of the 
death sentence impossible 
the aggravating circumstances of the crime known as the hifi 
murders one of the most notorious in modern utah history far 
outweighed any mitigating factors haun said 
after the drain cleaner was administered when the victims did 
not die quickly enough the decision was made to shoot the victims 
mr andrews waited outside while this took place but he left his 
loaded pistol for mr selby to use haun said 
mr andrews knew of mr selbys intent and shared in it he 
said 
selby was executed by injection in august 1987 after the pardons 
panel unanimously rejected his plea for commutation 
board member victoria palacios voted to commute saying that 
while andrews culpability was undeniable i would commute the 
death sentence and recommend he never be paroled 
andrews 34 a jonesboro la native showed no emotion while 
being led from the hearing room at utah state prison however 
andrews said i thank miss palacios for being fair and 
considerate 
one of the survivors of the attack orren walker testified at 
andrews and selbys commutation hearings and wiped tears from his 
face after todays decision his son was among those killed 
pardon board administrator paul sheffield said the board received 
thousands of letters and telegrams from throughout the world 90 
percent of them favoring clemency much of the mail has stemmed from 
efforts of amnesty international which has made the case an example 
in its effort to abolish capital punishment 
in the appeals andrews contends his constitutional rights were 
violated by being forced to accept as a public defender an 
inexperienced attorney and a judges failure to instruct the jury 
it could convict him of seconddegree murder 
the appeals also raised again the argument that a mistrial should 
have been declared for selby and andrews both black when a juror 
found a note bearing the words hang the niggers during a lunch 
break there were no blacks on the jury the sole potential black 
juror was excluded

a defense department research program in which 
cats are shot in the head to study warrelated brain injuries is 
inhumane scientifically flawed and unnecessary a group of doctors 
said 
the physicians committee for responsible medicine on thursday 
asked defense secretary richard cheney to cancel the contract for 
the research conducted at louisiana state university medical center 
in new orleans 
the study under question is superfluous and extraordinarily 
expensive dr michael sukoff a member of the american board of 
neurological surgeons said in a news release from washington 
the 2 million contract involves shooting hundreds of cats in the 
head to learn how to return braininjured soldiers to active duty 
thus conserving the fighting strength of the army the physicians 
committee said 
according to the news release the primary conclusion by lsu 
researchers is that respiration stops when the brain is wounded a 
reaction the doctors said has been documented in medical literature 
for nearly 100 years 
i am appalled by research which purports to study human brain 
injury but in fact only causes suffering in domestic cats dr 
christopher smith said 
the physicians group is a national organization of 2000 doctors 
who promote preventive medicine and alternatives to animal research 
officials from lsus school of medicine said the department head 
in charge of animal research was out of town and unavailable for 
comment

five gunmen today killed a police chief 
who led a crackdown on drug traffickers attacking him after he sent 
his bodyguards to protect court judges whose lives had been 
threatened 
the provincial police chief col waldemar franklin quintero was 
killed and his driver was wounded when the gunmen intercepted their 
car and riddled it with automatic weapon fire authorities and 
witnesses said 
authorities blamed the killing on the medellin cartel the 
worlds largest cocaine ring which is believed responsible for about 
80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into the united states 
they fired without mercy for several minutes at the colonel 
who was hit more than 100 times an unidentified witness told 
radio caracol his chauffer was seriously injured and taken to a 
hospital 
the nations judges went on strike thursday to demand increased 
protection they struck after gunmen hired by drug dealers killed 
magistrate carlos valencia garcia in bogota on wednesday night the 
killing also prompted 48 magistrates in bogotas superior court to 
hand in their resignations 
valencia garcia 43 had rejected court motions to exonerate two 
leaders of the medellin cartel who were accused in the 1987 slaying 
of a journalist 
the defense minister gen oscar botero said today that soldiers 
and police will increase protection for judges and intensify their 
crackdown on the cocaine industry he said police arrested 61 people 
in 100 raids this week on suspected drug processing and smuggling 
locations nationwide 
they confiscated arms and at a house in suburban bogota 77 
million dollars in cash gold checks and jewelry he said 
asked about the strike and franklin quinteros slaying justice 
minister monica de grieff said its terrifying what is happening 
in colombia 
the only way to confront this challenge is by fighting 
together the government judges the armed forces and the citizenry 
to stop the wave of violence she said in bogota she appealed to 
the countrys more than 4000 judges and magistrates to end their 
strike so traffickers dont achieve their goal of halting the 
administration of justice 
the attack on franklin quintero occurred moments after he left 
home 
witnesses said franklin quinteros car was severely damaged by 
the rain of gunfire and that its interior was covered with blood 
franklin quintero directed the local campaign against cocaine 
trafficking and led several major raids that resulted in the seizure 
of tons of the drug and the arrest of several dealers 
helena herran de montoya the governor of antioquia province 
where medellin is located said the colonel gave up his bodyguard 
force because he thought it was more important to use this 
personnel in protecting judges 
the attack was the latest in several drugrelated killings in 
medellin colombias secondlargest city and its industrial center 
in the last month two officials investigating the activities of 
cocaine kingpin pablo escobar gaviria have been slain on thursday 
night an armed band intercepted a police van carrying 18 people who 
had been arrested and set them free they included several suspected

unusual techniques to prepare himself and his costars on the set 
like the time he whacked robert downey jr across the side 
of the head and knocked him over knocked his glasses across the 
room woods told smart magazine in its septemberoctober issue 
the moment came during the filming of true believer downey 
is a really great actor woods said but he was missing the 
magic that i knew he was capable of during a closeup so woods 
whacked him a stunned downey finished the scene then laughed 
i hate to see anybody that brilliant not be really up to the 
mark you know what i mean i just woke him up for a second woods 
said 
i would appreciate it if he did it for me i cant really 
remember if anybody has ever done anything like that to me 
bobby de niro once sent me a pair of red highheeled pumps from 
fredericks of hollywood before i did a scene in once upon a time 
in america woods recalled 
so i just walked in wearing my tux and my oldrubberhead 
makeup and these big fluffy feathery highheeled blazingred

less than a decade ago a burly shipyard 
electrican named lech walesa was in jail the fledgling labor 
organization he founded in ruins today his popularity and the 
stunning rebirth of the solidarity movement have forced the 
communist party to loosen its iron grip on the government 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
lech walesa strode into the parliament 
building the sound of applause from opposition lawmakers filling 
the hall that was once a mere cog in the communist government 
many of the solidarity deputies who cheered him were respected 
politicians and scholars but they knew they owed their political 
provenance to the short stout peasants son who never went to 
college 
still walesa manages to shoulder his awesome personal myth with 
humor and dignity 
i never thought i could be prime minister he told the 
lawmakers with a shake of his head the other night 
they all shared a laugh of course he could be prime minister if 
he wants one day he may be president the polish people it seems 
would elect him to any office in free elections 
that trust in the man behind the moustache is the polish 
opposition movements greatest asset it is the reason communist 
politicians have been forced to cooperate with him it is the lever 
with which he is prying power away from them 
a true polish original his political instincts and timing have 
proved unerring as he has evolved from the charismatic worker leader 
of 1980 to the national leader and international statesman of 1989 
he now appears to have pulled off what could amount to a 
bloodless revolution extricating the government from communist 
control after 45 years 
his impact has reached into other parts of the east bloc if 
polands government slips out of communist control can hungary be 
far behind how easily do party leaders in neighboring 
czechoslovakia and east germany rest knowing theres a lech walesa 
not that everybody in poland is a walesa fan some in his own 
movement find him arrogant accusing him of making decisions without 
consulting his followers others fault him for being too apt to 
compromise with a system they regard as illegitimate 
this week as his envoys were quietly coaxing longtime communist 
allies to form a solidarityled parliamentary majority walesa came 
under fire from lawmakers who resented his secret dealings 
others in the chamber asked why in the bid for power solidarity 
should give over two key ministries to the communists the ministry 
of defense and the ministry of internal affairs which controls the 
police 
two of his oldest associates are in opposition to him andrzej 
gwiazda a mentor for walesa in opposition activity in gdansk in the 
late 1970s and anna walentynowicz the crane operator whose firing 
in august 1980 prompted the shipyard strike that started walesas 
astonishing climb to worldwide fame 
but many of his longtime coconspirators in the opposition have 
like walesa emerged this year as part of polands power structure 
and now are the senators and deputies whose faces fill the screens 
of statecontrolled television most nights 
as head of solidarity walesa has an office and an official car 
a dented grey polenez with a union banner afixed like an 
ambassadors flag proceeds from his autobiography have paid for the 
purchase of a spacious stucco house in gdansk where he lives with 
his wife danuta and their eight children 
the house has a tv satellite dish in the backyard and a quiet 
orchard and garden where walesa tries to relax 
nevertheless his path of hope as walesa titled his 
autobiography last year has not been smooth 
he was born in 1943 to a poor farming family in the small village 
of popowo in northcentral poland his father died from illness 
caused by forced labor under the nazis when walesa was only 18 
months old 
after finishing technical school where he was trained as an 
electrician he fixed farm machinery before drifting to gdansk in 
1967 and working at the lenin shipyard 
in december 1970 when workers went on strike along the baltic 
coast to protest food price increases security forces were called 
in and killed scores of workers 
walesa a rebel disgusted by poor safety conditions in the yard 
helped lead the strike there the experience never left him and one 
of his first acts when solidarity was born was to see to the 
erection of a monument on the square where the first victims died 
in his autobiography walesa recalls how his entry into illegal 
trade union activities in the late 1970s kept getting him fired from 
various jobs and his fears that the resulting poverty and many 
arrests were hurting his young family 
a low point came in late 1979 
we lived from day to day scarcely managing to make ends meet 
i was thus faced with a dilemma whether to withdraw from 
activism or whether to push on and become totally involved 
but he said he had already crossed the psychological barrier 
and could not give up what he had begun 
the next august he climbed the fence at the lenin shipyard 
where he had been fired in 1976 and took charge of the strike that 
galvanized the country strikers won the right to free trade unions 
leading to the birth of solidarity 
but it was only the beginning of the roller coaster squeezed 
between a hostile government and a militant membership he was 
constantly putting out fires 
when martial law came dec 13 1981 and he was imprisoned at a 
series of government houses walesa said it meant a chance to rest 
and sleep after the overwhelming tension of solidaritys 500 days 
of legal existance 
when he was released in november 1982 there were rumors he made 
a deal with authorities to get out he was cautious in his 
statements saying he was on a greasy tightrope 
but slowly old associates rallied around him he recalls in his 
autobiography in 1983 he was awarded the nobel peace prize 
under the pressure of a declining economy and foreign sanctions 
polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski lifted martial law in 1983 
and freed political prisoners in a series of amnesties that 
culminated in 1986 
government spokesman jerzy urban kept up a propaganda campaign 
against walesa over the years saying at the start of 1988 that 
activists were weak lost and out of touch with the masses 
but in may 1988 strikes broke out again and the workers chief 
demand was the legalization of solidarity a second wave of strikes 
in august prompted the first government talks with walesa since 1981 
when the anniversary of that meeting rolls around in two weeks 
solidarity well may be in control of the government

apologize to the court i can only say that ill never be back why 
i let this happen i dont know 
ive totally wiped out all of my income and have lost all hopes 
of getting my law license back

mistake he testified that he brought his own tie into the store to 
compare it with the one he was thinking of buying

the us ambassador to venezuela vetoed what he 
described as an illplanned illthought out plan by us agents 
to arrest the kingpin of the colombian drug cartel a state 
department spokesman said friday 
the aborted plan to arrest jorge ochoa last fall during a trip to 
caracas venezuela was disclosed thursday at a hearing of the 
senate judiciary committee on narcotics trafficking 
state department spokesman richard boucher said at a briefing 
friday that the plan to capture mr ochoa was not coordinated with 
the appropriate washington agencies and the embassy in caracas 
and the venezuelan government 
the department insists as do other law enforcement agencies 
on wellcoordiated operations boucher said there have been a 
number of wellcoordinated cases which have resulted in the 
conviction of major traffickers and these were the results of sound 
planning and good coordination 
such coordination insures that we advance our antinarcotics 
objectives without unecessary risks to government workers 
the former us ambassador to venezuela otto reich was quoted 
by the washington post in its friday editions as saying that 
everyone in the country was against the plan 
it was an illplanned illthought out operation and the 
government of venezuela said no it would have cost the lives 
innocent americans and venezuelans reich said boucher confirmed 
reichs version 
at the senate hearing on thursday a former assistant us 
attorney in miami richard gregorie said the customs service and 
the marshals service developed a plan to arrest ochoa in caracas and 
fly him to the united states for trial 
ochoa has been indicted by us grand juries several times but 
the colombian supreme court abrogated that countrys extradition 
treaty with the united states two years ago and he cannot be 
arrested by his countrys authorities on a us warrant

one rolling stone says the steel wheels will 
spin for only a year his glimmer twin says he hopes the band will 
stay together longer 
keith richards and mick jagger the quarrelsome frontmen for the 
rolling stones the band revealed their disparate views to 
rolling stone the magazine in an interview for its sept 7 issue 
if you asked me what i wanted to do for the rest of my life 
keith and i would probably disagree said jagger lead vocalist 
for the group when its good its really good and when it isnt 
good its boring its very hard to keep doing the same thing with 
the same people over and over again 
richards predictably disagreed 
i can never think about starting something up again in order to 
make it the last time said the stones guitarist this is the 
beginning of the second half 
jagger said one of the reasons he decided to reunite with the 
band for the steel wheels album and tour was that it would all 
be done within a year the tour begins aug 31 in philadelphia 
so we just have to put up with each other for a year jagger 
said 
richards who badmouthed jagger in interviews and on his album 
in the past year said he knew the stones would be able to work 
together again after he and jagger spent some time in barbados 
i did have to take mick to a few discos which are not my 
favorite places in the world because mick likes to go out and 
dance at night richards recalled so i did that that was my 
sacrifice i humored him and thats when i knew we could work 
together

us congressmen said friday that a reorganization 
of soviet forces in eastern europe is making it difficult to assess 
mikhail s gorbachevs promised withdrawal of 50000 soldiers 
the members of the house armed services committee who were 
ending an 11day trip to the soviet union praised their hosts for 
granting them unprecedented access to military facilities that they 
said will help build trust between the superpowers 
but they said the trip had not clarified how the withdrawal from 
eastern europe will affect the soviet unions fighting capability 
we dont know what combat power is left in eastern europe after 
the restructuring said rep john kasich rohio 
he said some units may be equipped with artillery for the first 
time 
we came here confused and we left confused he said 
committee chairman rep les aspin dwis said that in the 
process of withdrawing six divisions from its eastern european 
allies by the end of 1990 the soviets are separating some regiments 
and attaching them to divisions that will remain in eastern europe 
previously us officials assumed that entire divisions would be 
withdrawn completely he said but aspin added we have no 
evidence to indication those cuts arent going to be made 
aspin said the soviet union has no obligation to outline the 
details of the unilateral withdrawal that gorbachev announced at the 
united nations in december but he urged the soviets to make their 
actions as clear as possible 
the building of trust is what really counts he added 
the visit was one of a series of highlevel contacts in an era of 
better ussoviet relations 
the congressmen said they hoped that members of the supreme 
soviets new committee on defense and state security would visit in 
january or february 
during their visit the congressmen also saw the soviet space 
shuttle assembly facility and its highenergy laser two of them 
visited a chemical weapons decommissioning plant in chebayevsk 
they visited soviet ground forces in east germany and in the 
soviet union as well as us military headquarters in west berlin 
rep larry hopkins rky said he was impressed with the size 
and advanced technology of the chemical plant i was less

federal investigators say mechanical failure 
didnt cause the cessna 177 crash that killed us rep larkin smith 
and his pilot 
the comments of national transportation safety board investigator 
jeff kennedy came thursday as gulf coast residents mourned the 
deaths of smith and pilot chuck vierling in separate funerals 
smith a 45yearold freshman congressman from mississippis 5th 
district and vierling 58 died sunday night when their 
singleengine plane crashed into the desoto national forest en route 
to the gulf coast 
investigators with the ntsb have said vierling apparently strayed 
from his anticipated flight path on the 70mile trip before clipping 
a 70foot pine tree 
there was no structural failure of the airplane said 
kennedy who spent three days in mississippi before returning 
thursday to his miami office right now weve ruled out any 
inflight breakup of the aircraft he did not lose any of the 
components of the airplane 
the investigation now centers on weather and the pilots actions 
kennedy said 
it could be four months before the ntsb rules on the cause of the 
crash 
the armed forces institute of pathology in washington dc is 
examining tissue samples to determine if vierling was physically 
impaired during the flight

consumer prices rose just 02 percent in july 
continuing their slowdown from the steep acceleration experienced 
earlier in the year the labor department said friday 
while retail prices were up 59 percent for the years first 
half the moderation actually began in june when prices also rose 
02 percent 
private analysts and the white house said the twomonth softening 
was a sign that the economy has moved beyond the worst inflationary 
period 
its pretty clear that inflations peaked out said lawrence 
chimerine senior economic adviser at the wefa group in bala cynwyd 
pa 
we believe inflation is on a downward trend said white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater with a vacationing george bush in maine 
economic indicators seem to be moving in the right direction and 
the economy is growing steadily 
the labor department said the june and july figures both resulted 
from drops in energy and clothing prices combined with only small 
gains in food costs rising energy and food prices had paced 
consumer cost increases from january through may 
analysts and the bush administration also took the summers price 
moderation as fresh evidence that the federal reserve board is 
succeeding in its attempts to guide the oncesoaring economy to a 
softlanding moderate growth with restrained inflation 
the overall trend has been that the economy is in fact 
achieving the soft landing everyone was hoping for said sandra 
shaber an economist with the futures group a washington 
forecasting firm in other words growth is continuing but 
inflation is under control 
easing inflation has been the goal of the federal reserve for 
more than a year as it raised interest rates with the hope of 
cooling the economy but not sending it into a recession 
whether the new moderation will now prompt the fed to resume 
nudging interest rates downward as it began to do in june was a 
matter of dispute 
fitzwater said the report should take the pressure off interest 
rates 
but chimerine and william dunkelberg dean of the temple 
university school of business in philadelphia said they do not 
expect any major moves by the central bank in the immediate future 
at this point the fed is going to sit tight and say theres no 
scare on the inflation side the economy is showing signs of 
slowing but theres really no need to make a dramatic move 
either dunkelberg said 
chimerine and shaber expect little further immediate improvement 
in the inflation rate each expects inflation in the coming months 
to be in the range of 45 percent to 5 percent compared with the 
44 percent rate for 1987 and 1988 
last month energy prices fell 07 percent gasoline prices 
which had shot up 212 percent in the first five months of 1989 
fell 22 percent thier steepest fall since october 1986 
other less significant energy prices rose fuel oil was up 15 
percent reversing junes 12 percent decline while electricity and 
natural gas costs rose 07 percent and 04 percent respectively 
clothing costs were off 08 percent due in large part to 
unusually high endofseason price cuts for womens clothing the 
department said 
at the same time food and beverage prices edged up just 03 
percent after rising a hefty 93 percent in the first five months of 
1989 as the effects of last years drought lingered 
prices for cereal products beverages and sweets all rose 
substantially but were offset by a 07 percent decline in the costs 
of meats poultry fish and eggs 
excluding the volatile food and energy areas consumer prices 
rose a moderate 04 percent 
tobacco costs rose 2 percent while newcar prices fell 04 
percent 
all the prices changes are seasonally adjusted a process 
designed to remove from the calculations influences that are 
periodic and predictable 
the various july changes unadjusted left the overall consumer 
price index at 1244 percent of its 198284 base that means a 
hypothetical selection of goods costing 100 in the base period 
would have cost 12440 in july 30 cents more than in june 
in a separate report the department said americans average 
weekly earnings after adjusting for inflation rose 15 percent in 
july after a 01 percent increase in june 
the july rise stemmed from a 08 percent increase in average 
hourly earnings and a 09 percent increase in average weekly hours 
which were partially offset by a 02 percent increase in prices as 
measured by an index for urban wage earners 
average weekly earnings in july before adjusting for inflation 
were 33801 up 42 percent from a year earlier taking the 51 
percent inflation rate for urban workers into account over the last 
12 months real weekly earnings were down 09 percent

pope john paul ii will urge the young to 
spread roman catholicism when he addresses an unusual rally saturday 
in spain that promises to resemble a huge scout jamboree 
the church has brought in 160 bishops including cardinal john 
oconnor of new york and expects at least 300000 youngsters at the 
international rally the highlight of john pauls threeday visit to 
spain 
young people from 55 countries are traveling to santiago de 
compostela for the churchsponsored fourth world youth day 
including groups from communist cuba bulgaria and the soviet 
republic of lithuania 
most are housed in tents turning the city of 85000 and its 
environs into a giant campground 
a flotilla of about 600 motorboats and fishing vessels sailed 
into nearby la coruna on friday recalling pilgrims who traveled by 
sea to santiago de compostela in northwestern spain 
the purpose of all the activity is to capture the imagination of 
young people and convince them to be standardbearers in the 
churchs crusade for a more christian less secular world vatican 
officials said 
what this represents is a growing attention to youth and 
working with youth as a pastoral priority of the roman catholic 
church said monsignor peter coughlan undersecretary of the 
vaticans pontifical council for the laity which organized the 
event 
the popes itinerary also includes visits sunday evening and 
monday to the northern cities of oviedo and covadonga which he did 
not reach in his previous trips to spain in 1982 and 1984 
during those stops the 69yearold pontiff will say masses 
dedicated to the subjects of labor and devotion to mary 
while his message at santiago is for world youth the oviedo and 
covadonga trips are aimed specifically to catholics in spain whose 
adherence has declined in the 11 years since church and state were 
officially separated in the overwhelmingly catholic country 
in addition to the rally saturday night on a mountain just 
outside santiago pope john paul ii will celebrate youth day with a 
sunday mass 
coughlan said the popes attention to youth was both personal and 
strategic 
john paul has had a longstanding interest in young people 
through his work as a university professor bishop and cardinal in 
addition coughlan said the pontiff realizes the young are 
increasingly becoming the worlds majority especially in 
underdeveloped countries 
the future of the church in places like zaire is caught up with 
youth he said in an interview 
santiago de compostela was chosen for the rally to emphasize the 
historical roots of catholicism as the church approaches its third 
milennium vatican officials say 
the city became one of the three main pilgrimage sites of 
christianity along with jerusalem and rome after the bones of the 
apostle st james were said to have been discovered there in the 9th 
century 
many youngsters participating in the rally walked part of the 
traditional 500mile way of st james that stretches from the 
pyrenees to santiago 
in a message for world youth day published in advance john paul 
said santiagos history reminds catholics that they must spread 
their faith 
the world of today is a great land of mission even in the 
countries with an ancient christian tradition he said 
everywhere today neopaganism and the process of secularization 
constitute a great challenge to the evangelical message 
among secular practices the church opposes are abortion 
artificial birth control and divorce 
john paul celebrated the first world youth day in rome in 1986 
and the second in buenos aires argentina the vatican plans to hold 
the event outside rome every other year 
this years special day followed a week of churchsponsored 
cultural and religious conferences in santiago de compostela that 
brought catholic youth leaders together

mayor raymond l flynn said friday he is working to 
get city pension money and trust funds away from companies that do 
business in northern ireland and fail to reduce job discrimination 
against catholics 
we have to make sure the british government understands the 
importance of fair employment practices and opening their economy to 
all said flynn who said he witnessed widespread job 
discrimination against roman catholics when he visited northern 
ireland last year 
the unemployment rate is twice as high for catholics as it is for 
protestants in britishruled northern ireland catholics are a 
minority there but a majority in the irish republic 
flynn filed a home rule petition thursday calling for the 
divestiture and signed an executive order requiring city contractors 
owned by companies doing business in northern ireland to subscribe 
to the macbride principles 
the principles named after the late irish diplomat sean 
macbride winner of the 1974 nobel peace prize are aimed at 
reducing job discrimination against catholics the guidelines 
provide for equal access to jobs and promotion the banning of 
religious emblems from the workplace public advertising of jobs and 
for companies to monitor their affirmative action efforts 
francis costello flynns adviser on irish affairs said the 
principles were modeled after the sullivan principles which address 
investment in south africa 
the home rule petition must be approved by the city council and 
the legislature the executive order which affects contracts worth 
several million dollars does not need city council approval 
costello said he expected the plan would win legislative approval 
since massachusetts in 1984 became the first state in the nation 
to pass a law embracing the mcbride principles ten other states and 
a halfdozen cities have taken similar action 
costello said previous legislation has been largely symbolic and 
that flynns proposals are enforceable he said flynn would campaign 
for other mayors to take similar steps 
flynn said chicago mayor richard m daley was considering such a 
proposal 
the contractor order would not affect hiring practices of 
contractors locally but would take their contracts away if their 
owners dont follow the employment standards in northern ireland 
costello said the macbride standards for northern ireland are no 
more severe than the affirmative action requirements on minority 
hiring in the united states 
this is not an effort against american companies at all 
flynn said certainly we do not want to hurt job opportunities or 
the economy of northern ireland 
but alan white deputy consul general for great britain in 
boston said that is exactly what would happen 
pressure to abide by the principles has had a discouraging 
effect on new american companies trying to establish themselves in 
northern ireland he said 
if you follow the macbride principles you have to sack 
protestants and hire catholics said white which would only add 
to the tense environment in northern ireland 
white said flynn should give a law passed earlier this year by 
british parliament a chance to work the law outlaws job 
discrimination in northern ireland but does not require affirmative 
action 
boston has about 11 million in pension funds invested in seven 
of the 24 american companies doing business in northern ireland and 
2 million in trust funds invested in nine of the companies 
more than half of the 11 million in pension money and nearly 
onefourth of the trust funds are invested in digital equipment 
corp other companies are nynex ford motor co general motors 
exxon sunoco and dunn amp bradstreet 
about 30 percent of bostons 600000 people are of irish 
extraction said bill odonnell community relations manager for the 
boston redevelopment authority

a woman whose newborn tested positive for 
cocaine was being held on 20000 bond friday on charges she used 
drugs during pregnancy 
marcelle d bruce 25 was arrested friday on felony charges of 
criminal neglect a warrant charges her with being a cocaine user 
causing her infant babys health and life to be in danger 
she is the fourth woman in greenville in less than a week to be 
arrested on such charges 
the infant was born last weekend at greenville memorial hospital 
and remains in the hospital said police detective dl butler 
police will take the baby into protective custody next week ms 
butler said she said the infant could be placed in foster care by 
the state 
of the babies born to the other three women arrested one is in 
the hospital and two are in foster care officials said 
a meeting is planned next week among police state officials the 
solicitors office and the hospital to work out a formal system for 
handling these drug cases ms butler said 
this is just the beginning she said youre going to see a 
whole lot more of these in the future 
the hospital has supported the police but some hospital 
employees questioned the prosecution of mothers who come to the 
hospital to deliver their children 
a woman who gives birth to a drugaddicted baby should be treated 
as a medical rather than criminal matter said rosemary boling head 
nurse at memorials nursery 
if the mother knew she would be criminally prosecuted she 
might avoid prenatal care that would put an already atrisk baby 
at even more risk said dr paul catalana an instructor in 
memorials pediatric residency program 
but county assistant solicitor catherine christophillis said the 
arrests protest the babies and offer a chance to get the women into 
treatment programs 
its not like im out here saying all these mothers should go 
to jail ms christophillis said my goal is to rehabilitate 
them if they want to to provide an opportunity for them and then 
take a look and see if they want to do it

the ethics in government act is riddled with 
exceptions and loopholes that let former executive branch 
officials lobby with few restrictions the prosecutor who won a 
perjury conviction against michael deaver said friday 
prosecuting deaver on charges of lying about his lobbying of 
former government colleagues was a useful contribution to the 
public interest independent counsel whitney north seymour said in 
a final report on the case 
but seymour noted his inability to seek charges against the 
former white house deputy chief of staff accusing him of violating 
lobbying restrictions in the ethics law 
seymour said the lobbying provisions in effect at the time of the 
deaver case were riddled with exceptions and loopholes which made 
it extremely difficult to enforce except for the most flagrant 
violations 
the prosecutor said there was an absence of sufficient readily 
available credible evidence and there were legal questions about 
the scope of the ethics law 
deavers lawyers said in their own report that seymours 
conclusions ring hollow they said the investigation and 
prosecution of deaver raise concerns about the potential for 
abuse of the ethics law under which seymour was appointed to 
launch his criminal probe 
for purposes of the postemployment lobbying restrictions of the 
ethics law the white house at the time of the deaver case was 
divided into nine separate agencies a situation known as 
compartmentalization 
the law prohibits former employees from lobbying the agency or 
department where they worked but because of compartmentalization 
deaver had a blanket exemption for contacts with most of the key 
white house officials he had worked with regularly said seymour 
the bush administration has since decided to treat the various 
white house components as one agency for purposes of the ethics law 
legislation to ban compartmentalization is pending 
nonetheless even where a former official employs his own 
former staff aides for his lobbying business and uses them to carry 
personal messages to his former agency such activity is 
permitted said seymour 
deavers lawyers said seymours comments contradict his earlier 
statements in court that deaver had committed perjury in order to 
conceal his violations of the ethics law 
we now know that mr seymour knew that that was not true at the 
very time that he was telling the court that it was said deavers 
lawyers 
in response the prosecutor issued a sixpage statement saying 
that deaver distorts independent counsels explanation for not 
prosecuting him for violations of the ethics law seymour said he 
never concluded that deaver didnt violate the ethics law 
deaver was convicted of lying when he denied to congress that he 
had facilitated a meeting between the korean trade representative 
and president reagan he also was convicted for lying to a grand 
jury by denying that he made government contacts on behalf of twa 
and denying he contacted government officials for the commonwealth 
of puerto rico 
seymours conclusions and deavers response were released by a 
special panel of the us court of appeals 
reagans onetime deputy chief of staff was fined 100000 and 
ordered to perform 1500 hours of community service for his three 
felony convictions in 1987 of lying under oath to a house 
subcommittee and grand jury that questioned him about his lobbying 
of former reagan administration colleagues 
citing a 1 million legal bill deaver is seeking to reduce to 
25000 the 100000 fine 
deaver has begun counseling alcoholics at a downtown shelter for 
the homeless

a truck hauling 40000 rounds of 
military aircraft ammunition caught fire on an interstate highway 
early today killing a woman and seriously injuring her companion 
authorities said 
hours after the fire broke out the northbound lanes of the 
interstate were still closed as shells continued to explode but the 
accident happened in a remote area and no one had to be evacuated 
officials said 
it was like fireworks rock springs fire chief pete davis he 
said ammunition and shell casings were scattered 100 yards around 
the truck and explosions kept everyone at a distance for hours 
sgt allan schmidt spokesman for the arizona department of 
public safety said the couple aboard the truck were believed to be 
husband and wife somehow the gentleman was either thrown free or 
got out he said the woman was found dead 
the man was in serious but stable condition in john c lincoln 
hospital in phoenix at midday hospital spokesperson lisa boulay 
said the couples names were not immediately released 
the trucktrailer rig under contract to the military was on 
interstate 17 en route to the navajo army depot near flagstaff when 
a fire apparenty engulfed it about 1 am schmidt said 
it was hauling 20 millimeter aircraft cannon ammunition 
smoke was still coming from the truck and ammunition was still 
exploding sporadically five hours later said schmidt 
the accident occurred in a rural sparsely populated area about 
30 miles north of phoenix schmidt said there were no evacuations 
i17 was completely closed for three hours but the southbound 
lanes were later reopened and were accommodating traffic in both 
directions they are separated from the northbound lanes by several 
hundred feet 
no one is going near this vehicle said schmidt there are 
still occasionally explosions as rounds go off we do not really 
know how far ammunition has been thrown from the vehicle but it has 
been thrown 
two teams of ordnance experts from luke air force base near 
phoenix and the armys fort huchuca in sierra vista in southern 
arizona were dispatched to the scene 
lt col ed cooke of kelly air force base in san antonio 
confirmed the truck carried 40000 rounds of class d ammunition 
weighing 37000 pounds cooke said said the ammunition had been 
stored in arizona but came originally from a kellyrun storage 
facility located at lackland air force base also in san antonio 
schmidt said authorities either got erroneous information from 
the military or misunderstood it when they initially reported the 
truck carried 800000 rounds of ammunition

an f4 phantom jet smashed into a 
concrete barrier at 480 mph in a test to learn how to protect a 
nuclear reactor from a plane crash 
the surplus plane strapped to rails and propelled by rockets 
slammed into a millionpound barrier at sandia national laboratories 
on april 18 1988 details of the test were reported thursday during 
the 10th international conference on structural mechanics in reactor 
technology at anaheim calif 
the crash data are going to give us an unprecedented ability to 
predict the impact force when an aircraft crashes into a building 
said walter a von riesemann supervisor of sandias containment 
technology division 
wed previously done some fairly accurate computer analysis 
but the computer models were untried on the real thing not 
anymore 
researchers need to estimate the structural response of a 
building in such an accident to do that they must know how the 
impact force changes throughout the brief time the crash is in 
progress sandia officials said 
the f4 jet weighed 42000 pounds at impact which included more 
than 1200 gallons of water to simulate the weight of fuel and 
provide proper mass distribution sandia officials said 
sixteen highspeed framing cameras recorded the crash shooting 
from 500 to 2000 frames per second 
the concrete block supported by air bags that enabled it to be 
moved with just 2000 pounds of force suffered minor damage with 
the engines penetrating no more than 24 inches 
the target was able to move acting much like a bathroom scale 
with the force of impact determined by measuring how much the block 
moved 
the test was funded by the muto institute of structural mechanics 
inc of tokyo

the united states is reducing its military 
training and presence in somalia to protest gruesome human 
rights abuses by security forces in the strategically placed east 
african nation us officials said friday 
the decision comes as the administration seeks to renegotiate an 
agreement for use of the red sea port of berbera by us navy 
vessels moving to and from the indian ocean the pact expires next 
year 
although us military assistance to somalia in the past two 
years has dwindled sharply the decision to cut it further indicates 
us frustration with the governments inability to reign in the 
security forces and control a growing mutiny throughout the country 
the officials said 
as a token of our frustration with the security forces we 
decided to reduce our military activities said one official 
the government of somalia knows its no longer business as usual 
officials are still examining what programs to cut but well 
be looking at training areas and that will mean pulling out some 
us military advisers the official said 
somalia which had shifted its alliance from the soviet union to 
the west in 1977 flirted with libya last year and received some 
military supplies but with the us decision to suspend weapons 
deliveries somalia has been buying arms on the open market to use 
against some rebels 
theres general communal strife throughout somalia said one 
official gvernment control outside mogadishu is slipping he 
added speaking only on condition of anonymity 
in the northern part of the impoverished country of 6 million 
the somali national front has gained ground against government 
troops while in the south ogadeni tribesmen are conducting a 
hitandrun guerrilla campaign 
reliable information is hard to come by because journalists have 
been prevented from visiting the country and dissidents are afraid 
to speak out 
but the state department says there are credible reports that 
last month security forces summarily executed dozens of somalis on 
the beach near mogadishu following clashes between moslems and 
government troops that left 400 people dead 
the events are tragic gruesome said the official i hope 
the government can find their way out of it but they seem to have 
lost their way 
the united states had been encouraged earlier this year when 
president siad barre under strong congressional pressure from 
washington freed 200 to 300 political prisoners barre an 
autocratic ruler who has run the oneparty state since 1969 also 
agreed to speak to some opposition figures 
to encourage further progress the administration asked congress 
for 21 million to help somalia pay its arrears to the international 
monetary fund said the official 
but with the rioting in midjuly and the mass executions 
congress turned down the request he said 
we decided not to fight it we cant make a credible argument 
to congress we cant show anything positive he said 
the administration has sought to stave off congressional 
criticism of somalias human rights violations in recent years 
through backstage pressure on barre to improve his record 
congress last year froze nearly 40 million in food and 
development aid for somalia and the administration decided to 
suspend all lethal weapons supplies after us rifles and ammunition 
were used against rebels and civilians in the north 
most of the us aid since then has been of nonlethal military 
equipment as well as training of somali personnel 
the somali national front which is the largest antigovernment 
force has been fighting barres forces for seven years at least 
one senior government commander reportedly deserted in recent weeks 
but most of the countrys six major tribes appear to be warring 
against the government or each other said the us official 
events are running beyond anyones control it strains ones 
credulity to think someone is masterminding it but responsibility 
for controling the situation lies with the government forces he 
said

friday refused to reassess the 1968 warsaw pact invasion that 
abruptly halted the nations move toward a freer society 
the 21st anniversary of the sovietled invasion is monday the 
occasion has brought many appeals including from warsaw pact 
neighbors to rewrite the emotional chapter in czechoslovak history 
the party leadership however refused to alter the official view 
that the invasion was a good thing 
there are various attempts at home and abroad at wouldbe 
reassessment of the events of the time said a communist party 
presidium statement carried by the official ctk news agency 
the period of social crisis in 196869 and events connected 
with this period have been thoroughly assessed and evaluated using 
all accessible documents by the 14th congress of the communist party 
in 1971 the statement said 
that congress condemned the prague spring reforms and gave 
formal approval to the armed intervention 
the anniversary of the invasion has highlighted the divisions in 
the east bloc where some nations are experimenting with more open 
economies and cultures and others are adhering to strict socialism 
the lower house of the polish national assembly on thursday 
adopted a resolution asserting that the invasion violated every 
nations natural desire for democracy freedom and respect of 
human rights the upper house criticized the invasion last week 
hungarian communists issued a statement tuesday saying they 
disagreed with the invasion and urged the prague leadership to 
reassess the events 
but the invasion has been defended by east germany which has 
rejected the sort of democratic reforms undertaken by poland and 
hungary east germany and czechoslovakia are among the most 
hardline soviet bloc countries 
the intervention proved to be the only effective way out new 
germany the east german communist party daily said friday 
ctk said the presidium agreed that the hungarian statement 
objectively helps forces which act against socialism in 
czechoslovakia

would crack down on all public demonstrations attempting to 
commemorate the anniversary 
czechoslovak human rights groups and prominent activists have 
asked there be no street protests citing fears of a harsh response 
by the authorities 
the 1968 invasion crushed the shortlived liberalization period 
spearheaded by thencommunist party leader alexander dubcek 
except for romania the invasion included all of czechoslovakias 
warsaw pact allies the soviet union bulgaria east germany

the state department on friday again criticized 
syrias allies in lebanon for shelling christian enclaves in the 
wartorn country and urged them to observe a ceasefire on all 
fronts 
spokesman richard boucher said recent reports indicated syrian 
troops were not actively engaged in the fighting but he stressed 
the reports dealt with a 12hour period and it was too early to say 
whether syria had heeded a us call to lay down its arms 
the most urgent thing the most important thing is for people 
to accept a ceasefire boucher said 
deferring again to the arab league to try to stop the fighting 
boucher said we would welcome a resumption of their efforts 
he said that amal and druze militias were continuing their drive 
against christian enclaves and that the christians were retaliating 
we feel there is no justification for continued military action 
in the face of urgent appeals and we urge all sides to implement and 
immediately observe a ceasefire on all fronts boucher said 
on monday the state department sharply condemned syria and its 
allies for the eruption of largescale ground fighting in lebanon 
and said the turmoil in the middle eastern country made us efforts 
to gain the release of american hostages more difficult 
syriasupported forces have joined the latest round of fighting 
in lebanon boucher said friday this represents an 
irresponsible escalation of the violence syria and its allies 
should refrain from any further escalation and accept immediately 
international and arab league calls for a ceasefire and a lifting 
of the blockade of christian ports 
at the same time boucher urged the christians to observe a 
ceasefire and to join in the political reconstruction of 
lebanon this means in effect agreeing to new powersharing 
arrangements with muslims that would reduce maronite influence in 
the country

the food and allied workers union said police used whips and live 
ammunition to disperse the workers and made several arrests

gates and ingored an order to disperse he said officers initially 
used whips but fired shotguns when some fleeing workers threw stones

solidarity editor tadeusz mazowiecki 
declared friday that he is ready to accept president wojciech 
jaruzelskis offer to nominate him as prime minister and break the 
communist grip on power in poland 
mazowiecki a veteran opposition activist who spent a year in 
jail during jaruzelskis martial law crackdown of 1981 confirmed he 
is the presidents choice to lead the next government 
our premier the opposition newspaper gazeta wyborcza 
proclaimed triumphantly if somewhat prematurely in a headline 
above mazowieckis smiling picture friday 
the formal announcement was planned for saturday the state 
official said but already the offical pap news agency was treating 
mazowiecki editor of the solidarity union weekly tygodnik 
solidarnosc as a major public figure it reported throughout the 
day his meetings with dignitaries 
the appointment of a solidarityled government the first 
noncommunist government in the soviet bloc since soviet dictator 
josef stalin consolidated control of eastern europe in the late 
1940s would be an event of historic significance 
local communist party chapters expressed dismay friday pap 
reported we are firmly against forming a government as proposed 
by the opposition said a statement issued by the wroclaw party 
we appeal to the central committee for a defense of socialist 
values said the walbrzych chapter according to pap 
mazowiecki met friday with party chief mieczyslaw f rakowski 
who has called a meeting of his central committee for saturday to 
discuss the government changes mazowiecki also met with roman 
catholic primate cardinal jozef glemp 
after meeting with jaruzelski mazowiecki confirmed he expected 
to be offered the post and would accept despite the huge 
problems he sees ahead 
it wont be easy he said referring to polands crippled 
economy 39 billion foreign debt food shortages and widespread 
public discontent 
i think the most difficult task will be to make people think 
that it can be better even though it cannot be better immediately 
and make them believe that their work is not wasted he said at 
the national assembly building 
solidarity leader lech walesa who deftly assembled the coalition 
of lawmakers that has apparently engineered a transfer of the 
government away from the communist party proposed mazowiecki to 
jaruzelski at a meeting thursday 
mazowiecki was one of three candidates offered by walesa and his 
coalition partners the united peasant and democratic parties and 
according to solidarity sources he was walesas first choice 
in addition to being the first noncommunist premier mazowiecki 
would be the first practicing catholic to head the government in 
this highly religious country since the war 
i am afraid of many things mazowiecki said but if i were 
only afraid i would be a total pessimist somebody has to try it i 
am a believer and i believe providence cares for us 
he said the talk with jaruzelski was very fundamental 
concerning all important topics 
mindful of the soviet unions strategic concerns solidarity has 
said it will grant the communists the ministries of defense and 
interior which oversee the army and police 
the soviet government daily izvestia on friday said it is clear 
poland is headed for its first noncommunist government in 
decades 
perhaps to reassure soviets there would be some continuity 
izvestia also ran excerpts from an interview walesa gave to west 
german tv in which he said poland would remain in the sovietled 
warsaw pact military alliance 
while moscow in recent days has expressed concern over the 
developments soviet foreign ministry officials have said that 
formation of the government is an internal polish affair 
president bush at this point is not considering expanding the 
119 million economic aid package he has announced for poland said 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater fitzwater said bush 
would have no comment on the selection of a new prime minister until 
the parliamentary process 
even with a noncommunist coalition in charge of the government 
the communist party will continue to wield great influence 
jaruzelski oversees military and foreign policy as president and 
party members are scattered throughout the government and courts 
jaruzelski must nominate the prime minister for approval by the 
sejm the lower house of the national assembly approval would seem 
assured because the solidarityled coalition forms a 264member 
majority in the 460member chamber 
mazowiecki would be given a period of several weeks to assemble a 
cabinet and present it to the sejm for a vote 
jaruzelski accepted the concept of a solidarityled government 
during a historic meeting with walesa on thursday walesa also 
offered two alternative candidates to mazowiecki solidarity 
parliamentary leader bronislaw geremek and longtime activist jacek 
kuron 
mazowiecki 62 was the least publicly known of the three but 
his ties to solidarity date to the august 1980 strikes in gdansk 
that gave birth to the movement 
a catholic journalist trained as a lawyer he was jailed for one 
year after the 1981 martiallaw crackdown for his opposition to the 
government mazowiecki also was at walesas side when nationwide 
strikes last year served as the catalyst for the governments 
decision to open talks with the union legalize it and allow 
opposition participation in elections 
those elections resulted in solidaritys victory in virtually 
every race its candidates entered 
before the unions rise mazowiecki was active in independent 
catholic circles mazowiecki was part of the znak group that managed 
under church protection to serve as a focal point for thinking 
independent of communist ideology in poland in the 1960s and 1970s 
the group was allowed a token number of seats in parliament and 
mazowiecki held one from 1961 to 1971 
he was the editor of a catholic monthly from 1958 until 1981 when 
he founded tygodnik solidarnosc it was banned under martial law but 
resurrected by mazowiecki this year after solidarity was legalized 
by rejecting the office of prime minister this week walesa 
remains free to head the union there is fear in the opposition that 
the coalition government might fail to satisfy social aspirations in 
the face of the countrys crushing economic problems and have to 
resign union advisers argued walesa should not risk his personal 
reputation

amish have a constitutional right to 
refuse to affix safety emblems to their horsedrawn buggies a 
unanimous minnesota supreme court ruled friday 
the decision dismissed traffic citations issued in 1988 against 
14 amish who had refused to display orangered slowmoving vehicle 
signs or an alternate black triangular emblem on their black buggies 
its a precedentsetting first amendment case said attorney 
phillip villaume who represented the amish our supreme court is 
the highest court in the country to address this specific issue 
its just a major victory for individuals and for the amish 
specifically 
assistant fillmore county attorney matthew opat who argued in 
support of the law said the ruling jeopardizes highway users even 
though there have been no accidents involving amish buggies 
it doesnt seem reasonable to have to have people killed and 
maimed before there is a public safety issue opat said he was 
unsure whether the county would appeal 
the 14 members of the old order amish religion had drawn petty 
misdemeanor charges for their refusal to use the emblems 
these appellants are unwilling to compromise their belief 
that the loud colors required and the worldly symbols the 
triangular shape represents to them conflicts with the admonitions 
found in apostle pauls epistles wrote associate justice glenn 
kelley 
to them to do so would be putting their faith in worldly 
symbols rather than in god 
fillmore county just north of the iowa border in southeastern 
minnesota has about 1000 amish residents who adhere to 19th 
century customs and generally do not use cars or other modern 
conveniences 
there are about 90000 amish in 22 states with the largest 
population in ohio which has about 31000 amish followed by 
pennsylvanias 27000 and indianas 22000 
fillmore county district judge clement h snyder refused in 
december to dismiss the charges but also asked that a higher state 
court review the matter 
the supreme court held that the trial court improperly determined 
that to be sincere a belief must be shared by a religious 
community as a whole 
the fact that at least one of the appellants has already 
actually suffered jail incarceration and that the others have 
persistently expressed a willingness to do so rather than comply 
with the statute must assuredly buttress that implicit finding that 
the appellants individually possessed a personal sincerity of 
belief kelley said 
two amish men were jailed on contempt of court charges filed 
after they refused to perform community work or pay a fine for their 
failure to use warning emblems opat said 
the supreme court said the state has a legitimate interest in 
protecting the public on its highways but it said even the 
blacktriangle option was burdensome to amish beliefs 
during the daytime the alternate emblem does not provide any 
more warning of the presence of a slowmoving vehicle than does the 
black square horsedrawn buggy itself the court said 
at night and in bad weather the amish have said they do not 
object to outlining the boxes of their buggies with silver 
reflective tape or to displaying red lit lanterns to supplement the 
tapes the court said 
obviously the amish are very concerned about the men women 
and children riding in those buggies villaume said theyre 
cautious and arent likely to compromise their safety when you put 
a buggy up against a vehicle the buggy obviously is vulnerable 
under the courts ruling amish dont have to use any warning 
insignia on their slowmoving vehicles villaume said however he 
said he will advise them to use the tape and lanterns cited by the 
court

police roused scores of homeless people from 
their cardboard boxes and piles of blankets early friday to drive 
them from the streets around manhattans port authority bus station 
why do they want to push all the people out ida rodriguez 
asked as she neatly folded the sheet that served as her mattress 
then she picked up her dirty purple teddy bear shoved her bandaged 
foot into a laceless sneaker and limped away as police approached at 
about 2 am 
the six port authority police officers who moved about 100 
homeless people out were said to be opposed to the operation but 
acting under orders its like throwing sand in the ocean one 
sergeant said 
the officers were followed by 10 men with brooms and garbage bins 
to collect the meager possessions left behind 
the first vagrants to be evicted had about five minutes to pack 
up the blankets they had draped from scaffolding on the side of the 
building before the garbage detail dismantled the makeshift curtains 
for them 
people living nearby saw the police coming and had more time to 
pack 
an elderly woman stacked her blankets and belongings into a 
teetering shopping cart im ok she said over and over again 
then she said theyre not going to throw this in the garbage 
its against the law 
a 16yearold girl was taken to nearby covenant house which 
helps those under age 21 
the area in and around the bus station has a large homeless 
population ranging from the needy who have nowhere else to go to a 
younger tougher crowd involved in drugs and prostitution 
during friday mornings operation 16 men agreed to go in a van to 
a shelter on wards island run by the volunteers of america 
others crammed what they could into milk crates and took off for 
nearby streets saying they would be back in a day or two no one 
was arrested 
people cant sleep in a shelter johnny rodriguez said as he 
roused a grizzled friend sleeping nearby put the mans arm over his 
shoulder and led him hobbling away 
another man refused to leave his pile of cardboard saying he was 
scheduled for a foot operation the next day and was to be picked up 
at the bus terminal 
police appeared skeptical until he produced his hospital 
appointment papers from a paper bag inspector james romito who 
directed the operation finally persuaded him to leave in an 
emergency medical services ambulance 
i dont think were overstepping our bounds i dont think 
were doing anything inhumane romito said this is part of our 
job what the police are supposed to do is maintain order

artillery exchanges elsewhere

friday and agreed to ask the arab league for an emergency summit on 
the lebanese crisis iraq an enemy of syria is the christians 
main arms supplier 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher said 
we feel there is no justification for continued military action in 
the face of urgent appeals and we urge all sides to observe a 
ceasefire on all fronts 
fighting began march 8 between the 20000 soldiers of gen michel 
aouns christian army command and an alliance of 40000 syrian 
soldiers and moslem militias

rocket launchers soon after midnight as the hydrofoil santa maria 
docked at jounieh a christian port 12 miles north of beirut the 
launchers can fire 40 rounds a minute

passengers were gathered on the dock to board the vessel when the 
rocketing started a port spokesman said 
the rockets fell around the santa maria he said one of 
them crashed into the dock close to where the passengers were 
wounding seven people and the ship sped away immediately 
tony mansour spokesman for the santa marias agents in larnaca 
cyprus said rockets began exploding around the ship before the crew 
had unloaded the baggage of 120 passengers who got off at jounieh

for safer areas in the south and east or have left lebanon 
altogether according to police they have not returned since the 
un action fearing a renewal of savage artillery battles 
what the security councils call for a ceasefire has achieved 
is nothing but a fragile lull accompanied by intermittent clashes 
and troop reinforcements as if all the factions are preparing 
themselves for a new round of war the respected beirut newspaper 
annahar said 
farid hamadeh who owns a motel on the seaside highway south of 
beirut said 
it seems everyone expects a new round of ferocious violence 
the 40 rooms are full no one is checking out all my clients have 
apartments in beirut but theyve been staying here for quite a 
while to escape the shelling 
here we are relatively close to beirut they hear the shell 
explosions watch artillery and rocket flashes in beirut during the 
night and drive to the city during relative lulls to check on their 
apartments and businesses

britain and argentina announced friday they 
would hold talks in october in spain to consider restoring ties 
severed by their war in 1982 over the falklands islands 
both sides called the agreement to meet in madrid oct 1718 a 
breathrough and said they were optimistic that relations would be 
normalized 
a joint statement issued after three days of talks in new york 
said the madrid discussions would be held without prejudice to 
sovereignty over the islands claimed by both argentina and britain 
the negotiators will consider diplomatic and consular relations 
confidencebuilding measures to avoid military incidents trade and 
financial relations air and sea communications links fisheries 
contacts between the falklands and the south american mainland and 
cultural scientific and sports relations according to the report 
sovereignty is not on the agenda 
the falklands 325 miles off of argentinas southern coast are a 
british colony britain has not eased its position on sovereignty 
and british ambassador sir crispen tickell said the agreement to 
hold normalization talks was due to the initiative of argentinas 
new president carlos saul menem 
tickell held the negotitaions with argentine special 
representative ambassador lucio ggarcia del solar 
both men read the communique and tickell said later 
i would call this agreement a breakthrough this development 
is very important for angloargentine relations and now enables us 
to go forward on a new basis i am optimistic because we have 
agreed to an agenda and to hold talks without prejudice to the 
sovereignty position on either side 
garcia del solar told reporters these contacts with britain 
began since president menem openly said he wanted a solution on the 
basis shown in this communique today 
argentina invaded and occupied the falklands in april 1982 but 
britain sent a task force and recaptured the islands in a 74day war 
that claimed nearly 1000 lives 
the falklands known in argentina as the malvinas has a 
population of about 2000 and most of the islanders are of british 
descent 
britain has said it will not relinquish sovereignty over the 
islands and menem dropped the previous governments insistence that 
argentinas sovereignty claim would have to be the first issue 
considered in normalization talks 
the communique said it was agreed that the madrid talks would 
take place under the terms of a formula to protect the position of 
each side with regard to sovereignty or territorial and maritime 
jurisdiction over the falkland islands south georgia and the south 
sandwich islands and the surrounding maritime areas

israel has agreed to coordinate its military 
activities with the united states if washington stops criticizing 
the israeli abduction of a shiite moslem cleric israeli sources 
said friday 
the kidnapping of sheik abdul karim obeid at his south lebanon 
home by israeli commandos july 28 caused retaliatory threats against 
american hostages in lebanon 
some members of congress denounced the abduction president bush 
called for the release of all people held against their will and did 
not exclude obeid who is affiliated with hezbollah the proiranian 
extremist group believed to sponsor hostageholders 
the captors of lt col willian r higgins a us marine 
kidnapped while on un duty in south lebanon said they hanged him 
in retaliation three days after obeid was seized but there were 
reports he had been killed months ago 
joseph cicippio one of the seven other american hostages was 
threatened with death then given a reprieve 
an israeli source close to the government said friday an 
understanding was reached between foreign minister moshe arens and 
secretary of state james a baker iii soon after the obeid abduction 
that they would adopt a joint policy for the hostage crisis 
he added on condition of anonymity there is an expressed 
israeli commitment when the crisis is over to discuss with 
americans coordination of future israeli activities that may have 
bearing on american interests and citizens 
that he said was the price israeli has paid for not being 
criticized now by the united states 
dan naveh an adviser to arens confirmed that arens and baker 
discussed future coordination in the days after the kidnapping 
they agreed not to get into this issue during the days of the 
crisis but in the future naveh said and stressed that the 
conclusion was to discuss the issue not necessarily reach an 
agreement 
he did not describe the agreement for consultation as an 
exchange but acknowledged that american criticism had abated 
avi pazner an adviser to prime minister yitzhak shamir said 
in the first days after we captured obeid there was some 
unhappiness in washington about it since then we have 
straightened out these matters through constant dialogue and there 
is no problem today 
the source close to the government said the bakerarens agreement 
caused concern in military and intelligence circles 
israel always prided itself on its autonomy in terms of 
strategy the source said theres a feeling that in order to 
get off the hook for a few days arens has mortgaged israels 
freedom of maneuver 
a us congresswoman who met with shamir on friday said she was 
encouraged by hopes of resolving the hostage situation but she also 
said she was anxious about american hostage terry a anderson the 
captive held longest 
rep louise slaughter a democrat who represents the new york 
state district where anderson grew up told reporters shamir would 
not give details on israeli efforts to free the captives 
she said she felt frustration as i am sure terry does that 
his government hasnt done much 
anderson chief middle east correspondent of the associated 
press was kidnapped march 16 1985 eight westerners in addition to 
the americans are held in lebanon

the fear of catching lyme disease from tick 
bites is causing people to use insect repellents in potentially 
harmful ways the environmental protection agency said friday 
the epa which regulates the pesticides used in insect 
repellents said misuse of repellents could result in adverse skin 
reactions headaches mood changes and possibly even convulsions or 
unconsciousness 
only a small number of reports of ill effects have been 
received but they have prompted concern that fear of lyme disease 
or the use of repellents for other biting pests may result in misuse 
or oversuse of these products the agency said 
cynthia georgeson a spokeswoman for sc johnson wax 
manufacturer of the insect repellent off said the company 
endorsed the epa advsisory because its very important to have 
people continue to use these products properly 
the company is the manufacturer of the widely used insect 
repellent and accounts for about 70 percent of the repellent market 
she said that because of the widespread publicity surrounding 
lyme disease which is transmitted by deer ticks sales of 
repellents are expected to be about 10 percent higher this year 
off accounts for about 70 percent of the repellent market she 
said 
among the suggestions from the epa are 
apply repellents only to exposed skin and not under clothing 
never use repellents over cuts wounds or irritated skin 
take care to keep repellents away from the eyes and mouth or 
the hands of small children 
avoid frequent reapplication or saturation of the skin one 
application is good for four to six hours depending on strength 
says ms georgeson 
after returning indoors wash repellent treated skin with soap 
and water especially if repellents have been used repeatedly during 
the day 
the epa said further information about the active ingredients in 
repellents and other information about their use can be obtained 
from the national pesticide telecommunciations network their 
24hour hotline number is 8008587378

the mayor and city manager of del rio texas 
asked the defense nuclear agency on friday to abandon consideration 
of a local ranch for a series of underground explosions designed to 
simulate the impact of soviet nuclear warheads on subterranean 
command centers 
petitions signed by nearly 12000 del rio area residents opposed 
to the tests on the buck king ranch were presented to vice adm john 
t parker jr director of the defense nuclear agency 
the del rio officials are concerned about the impact of the 
explosions on the border citys sole source of drinking water san 
felipe springs which was contaminated by an unknown substance in an 
underground cavein earlier this week forcing residents to boil or 
drink bottled water for two days 
we appreciate the opportunity to meet with the del rio mayor 
and city manager we better understand the concerns of the 
citizens parker said after the session with mayor alfredo 
gutierrez jr a physician and city manager jeffrey pomeranz 
were going to do everything that is possible to stop it and we 
so indicated to dna gutierrez said 
the mexican government has also inquired about possible 
explosions in an aug 4 letter that the state department answered 
thursday an official at state said friday 
the official said the letter advises mexico that an environmental 
assessment of the site must still be completed before any tests 
would be done 
agency spokeswoman cheri abdelnour said the agency continues to 
assess the del rio site currently the only location nationally 
under consideration for the series of underground explosions and 
will not make a final decision until technical and environmental 
assessments are completed 
the environmental assessment may take until january 1990 to 
finish she said 
clearly we will not be doing anything until that assessment is 
made the technical assessment as well as the environmental 
assessment she said 
the dna an agency of the defense department spent two years 
picking a site for the tests 
the explosions would start with a 1000pound charge in 1990 
increasing to 470 tons an equivalent of 300 tons of tnt in 
november 1992 
ms abdelnour said the tests would be performed with the same 
conventional explosives used by the mining industry and do not 
involve nuclear or radioactive devices 
they are designed to have no significant adverse impact on the 
environment including the water system ms abdelnour said 
but sen phil gramm rtexxas said local officials and residents 
have expressed great concern about the impact on the explosions on 
the springs which provides water to the city of 40000 and to 
nearby laughlin air force base 
given the 12000 people who have signed a petition and the 
great local concern about the tests i think it would save the dnas 
money to simply go ahead and make the decision and look for another 
test area gramm said

the bush administration reacted 
cautiously friday to reports that a solidarity activist would be 
named polands prime minister and to questions whether increased 
us economic aid might flow to such a government 
we will continue to watch the process and will increase aid as 
appropriate and as we can presidential press secretary marlin 
fitzwater told reporters 
fitzwater in maine with the vacationing president bush said 
discussion of any increase in the 119 million aid package bush 
announced last month was premature he said too little is known 
about the structure of polands changing government 
its too early at this point to know how they polands 
leaders are going to make it work let alone how it will work 
fitzwater said 
at the state department in washington spokesman richard boucher 
said weve got a lot under way to do the steps the presidents 
already announced and thats our priority right now 
fitzwater suggested the bush administration had no major problems 
with a coalition government in which a noncommunist prime minister 
will divide authority with a communist president although it means 
the communists will still control the military the police and the 
courts 
he applauded poland for the changes that have been made there 
over the past months toward more democracy 
all the words i said yesterday are operable today you may use 
them freely said fitzwater on thursday the spokesman called 
movement toward a noncommunist government in poland 
historymaking and remarkable 
fitzwater said the administration would reserve formal comment on 
news reports that polish president wojciech jaruzelski had chosen 
solidarity activist tadeusz mazowiecki to be the new prime minister 
and lead the east blocs first noncommunist government 
still white house aides privately said they were pleased with 
the apparent choice of mazowiecki a journalist and close associate 
of solidarity leader lech walesa 
fitzwater told reporters that letters from the president to 
walesa and jaruzelski being carried by senate minority leader bob 
dole rkan were just letters of greeting and did not contain 
messages on the current power shuffle dole left washington friday 
on a trip that will include a visit to poland 
bush has said his administration would reward poland for 
political reform and he unveiled the 119 million package of us 
aid during his visit to poland last month 
fitzwater said us budget restraints continue to be a factor in 
any possible boost in us aid we dont have a lot of money to 
offer 
at this point its just far too early to talk about signals of 
what we will do in terms of more us aid or whats available to 
us fitzwater said 
walesa told bush in july that poland will need at least 10 
billion in international aid us allies are expected to meet in 
europe in late september to discuss a multination rescue package to 
supplement the us aid 
at the state department boucher said the next step involves 
the concerted international efforts 
the summit seven agreed to a program of concerted efforts to 
promote reform in poland and hungary twentyfour countries attended 
the first meeting on aug 1 at which food assistance was discussed 
the next meeting is scheduled for late september he said 
fitzwater said that the new polish government no matter what 
precise form it takes has its work cut out for it getting the 
nations financial house in order 
economically it is going to be very difficult for any new 
government in poland he said problems would take a good deal of 
patience and determination to solve 
the spokesman said that the white house has had no direct contact 
with officials in poland were just watching things as they 
happen he said 
the situation is changing rapidly there and we would prefer not 
to have any further comment on the process until we reach a point 
where we have some assurances of how the government is going to be 
formed he added 
on another subject fitzwater said former president carter was 
acting on his own in inviting warring factions in ethiopia to meet 
with him in atlanta next month for peace talks 
he is not acting on behalf of the us government and does not 
have any official capacity or endorsement by us fitzwater said 
obviously if he can be successful or be a help in pulling the 
parties together there thats all for the better he said but 
its strictly a private initiative 
on the second day of his 2week vacation bush went boating with 
family members and played a round of golf 
bush kept up the constant banter with reporters on the golf 
course that has often marked his outings here 
as he teed off on the first hole bush told reporters 
the crowd is hushed they sense that mr smooth is back 
asked if he had seen a television interview the night before with 
vice president dan quayle bush answered 
no i didnt see it last night im on my vacation

guerrilla attacks on cuban troops in angola could delay the promised 
withdrawal of the soldiers from that african country cubas 
official news agency said friday 
the prensa latina agency said that in a letter to un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar castro accused 
anticommunist rebels of attacking cuban forces 
these criminal and irresponsible actions could have serious 
consequences castro said in the letter according to the prensa 
latina dispatch monitored in mexico city they could influence in 
an adverse way the compliance with the timetable on withdrawal of 
cuban troops from angola 
cuba under an agreement on a un plan for independence for 
namibia pledged to withdraw all of its troops from angola by july 
1 1991

unisys corp will cut more than 6000 jobs 
as much as 8 percent of the computer companys worldwide workforce 
by the end of 1990 in a restructuring plan announced friday 
the plan is in effect an acknowledgement by the harddriving 
chairman of unisys w michael blumenthal that the growth plans of 
the nations thirdlargest computer maker were too ambitious 
the basic strategies are working as planned but our 
operational profitability has clearly been inadequate for several 
reasons including the need to work off excess inventories weaker 
than expected us demand and sharper competition in all industry 
segments worldwide blumenthal said in a statement 
blumenthal had envisioned turning unisys into a 20 billion 
company by 1993 to make the company a more credible competitor to 
no 1 international business machines corp 
company spokesman michael a stugrin said friday the 20 billion 
goal was merely a dollar figure indicating the growth the company 
wanted to achieve 
in the 198990 time frame our major emphasis is operational 
profitability and profit margins were looking for growth in 
revenue and in market share 
the restructuring plan part of a review of all company 
operations to be completed by september is designed to combat an 
unexpected drop in domestic demand and tougher competition in the 
industry worldwide 
it follows a 67 percent drop in secondquarter earnings and a 
firsthalf loss of 251 million for the company formed in 1986 by 
the 48 billion purchase of sperry corp by burroughs corp 
blumenthal said unisys will cut annual costs by 400 million by 
the end of 1990 
over the same period unisys plans to cut its worldwide workforce 
of 88000 by 7 to 8 percent through attrition and layoffs stugrin 
said that amounts to between 6000 and 7000 workers he said 
since unisys has been under a hiring and salary freeze since the 
end of the second quarter employees who retire or leave the company 
will not be replaced stugrin said 
stugrin said a major focus of the job cuts will be in the united 
states where he said the softest market conditions prevail 
unfortunately 
he said unisys had taken pains to make sure our people 
understand the trends in the industry and in the marketplace and 
that the company had a sense of determination to see this through 
and go on to better conditions 
in the second quarter unisys recorded net income of 536 
million compared with 1623 million for the same period a year 
earlier the decline attributed to a drop in inventory pricing 
pressure from competitors and the pentagons temporary suspension 
of its defense business 
blumenthal had also attributed the earnings drop to the rise in 
the dollar decreasing the dollar value of sales made in foreign 
currencies 
in the first half of the year unisys lost 251 million 
compared with a profit of 3116 million a year earlier 
blumenthal said unisys is confident it will achieve positive 
results and greater profits in 1990 
in addition to being a major computer maker unisys is the 
nations 15th largest defense contractor and received 14 billion 
in contracts from the pentagon in 1988 
ibms revenue this year will be nearly 60 billion digital 
equipment corp ranks second with nearly 13 billion in annual 
revenue unisys is third with a little under 10 billion in revenue

the kremlin has decided to allow the first 
visit to soviet latvia by a us senator who plans to give a speech 
there urging greater independence for the baltic republic officials 
said friday 
sen robert kasten rwis was scheduled to leave saturday for 
the latvian capital of riga where he was to take part monday in a 
conference protesting the forcible annexation of the three baltic 
republics by moscow during world war ii he was to deliver a speech 
blaming soviet authorities for environmental pollution in latvia 
the government in moscow is not accountable to the people of 
latvia or even to the people of moscow and the result is 
environmental disaster kasten was to say in the speech which was 
provided in advance to the associated press 
state department officials who spoke on condition they not be 
further identified described the kremlin decision to allow kasten 
to travel to latvia and deliver such a critical speech as another 
sign of change in the soviet union 
the bush administration did not object to the visit said the 
officials despite longstanding us policy not to recognize 
moscows 1940 annexation of latvia and its two sister republics 
lithuania and estonia under this policy us officials are barred 
from having business contacts with senior communist party and 
government officials in the baltics republics 
kasten was taking part in the international conference on 
selfdetermination organized by the national independence 
movement of latvia in a news release the group described itself as 
an organization campaigning for latvias independence from the 
ussr 
the group said other congressional visits were expected to latvia 
this autumn 
kasten said in his prepared remarks officials in moscow who 
make decisions about the use of resources have no interest in 
protecting the environment of the baltic region their interest is 
in promoting heavy industry and in removing the pollution caused 
by that industry from the region of moscow 
the answer is decentralization a government closer to the 
people decisions about the latvian environment need to be made by 
the latvians the people whose children will have to inherit the 
latvia environment from their parents said the speech 
latvia lithuania and estonia scored a victory last month when 
the national parliament gave preliminary approval to legislation 
that would grant them greater economic autonomy including the right 
to print their own currency starting next jan 1 
that autonomy would include greater control over heavy 
industries which are now run by ministries based in moscow 
the communist party newspaper pravda signalled on thursday that 
further liberalization was in the wind by suggesting a 
reorganization of the soviet union to grant even more power to its 
15 constituent republics at the expense of central authorites in 
moscow

voluntarily will not be punished but it has given them no assurances 
their applications to emigrate will be approved 
kohl said earlier friday that he was willing to personally take 
up the issue with east german leader erich honecker if that was 
necessary to ease the strained relations between the two german 
states 
honeckers has said the relations will become even more difficult 
if west germany continues to shelter more than 300 east germans at 
its embassies and diplomatic missions in hungary poland 
czechoslovakia and east berlin 
west germany has issued more than 800 passports to other east 
german refugees in hungary who arrived after the embassy was closed 
seiters said west germany wants an impovement in relations but 
for the foreseeable future they are going to be strained no 
further negotiations were agreed to 
west german government spokesman herbert schmuelling told a news 
conference earlier friday that kohl received a letter from honecker 
thursday night in reply to kohls request that joint efforts be made 
to resolve the refugee situation 
schmuelling declined to disclose details of the letter but 
government sources said honeckers message resulted in seiters 
being sent to meet with krolikowski 
the failure of that meeting could put pressure on kohl to travel 
to east berlin to meet with honecker 
there is certainly no meeting scheduled as a normal course of 
events but it could be that if matters intensify at the budapest 
embassy that direct contacts would be demanded kohl told the ard 
broadcast network friday afternoon i would do this immediately if 
it appeared necessary 
honecker made an official trip to bonn in september 1987 kohl 
has not returned the visit and has suggested such a meeting depends 
in part on improved relations 
east germans angered at the lack of reform in their country 
have been going by the hundreds to neighboring hungary which began 
dismantling its barbedwire border with neutral austria in may east 
germans can travel freely to hungary as another sovietbloc country 
at least 1600 east germans are thought to have escaped 
undetected based on the number of refugees showing up at the west 
german embassy in vienna for help in obtaining west german documents 
foreign ministry sources reported thursday that 1100 east 
germans sought papers from the vienna embassy during the first two 
weeks of august 
east germans are automatically entitled to west german 
citizenship under the west german constitution but they need exit 
visas from their government to go to the west

a reserve soldier under investigation in the 
beating death of a palestinian shot himself to death with a 
submachine gun and news reports friday said he did it because he 
feared being blamed for the slaying 
in the west bank a village leader was killed by an assailant who 
suspected him of cooperating with israeli authorities arab reports 
said the reports said abdel rahim awad 62 was shot 14 times in 
the chest in kafr laqif 
the army confirmed the slaying awad is the 96th palestinian 
killed by his fellow arabs on suspicion of cooperating with israeli 
authorities 
in the gaza strip the army sealed three rooms in homes owned by 
palestinians accused of attacking arab collaborators an army 
spokesman said 
troops shot and wounded three palestinians in gaza including a 
17 year old who was in critical condition arab hospital officials 
said an army spokesman said the military is investigating the 
incidents 
also friday a new security policy that requires gaza strip 
residents to show computerized identification cards before entering 
israel took effect 
traffic to israel from gaza was light but officials said that 
was mainly because friday is a moslem prayer day not because of a 
strike call by palestinian activists opposed to the new cards 
israeli newspapers reported that reserve soldier yariv baryosef 
finished work as a night guard at the staterun television studio 
thursday put an uzi submachine gun to his head and shot himself 
in a suicide letter baryosef 25 said he faced questioning by 
military police and feared he would become a scapegoat for other 
soldiers involved in the beating death of hani elshami in august 
1988 the reports said 
they quoted his letter as referring to israel as a land that 
devours its people 
an army spokesman refused comment on the suicide saying the case 
was under investigation 
four soldiers of an elite infantry brigade were charged with 
beating to death elshami while on patrol they were acquitted of 
manslaughter but convicted of brutality after a military tribunal 
ruled that elshami died of beatings inflicted at the jabaliya 
detention center where he was taken after being beaten by the 
soldiers 
baryosef served at the detention center and told investigators 
he kicked elshami in the shoulder the day he died 
at least 537 palestinians have been killed in clashes with 
soldiers or israelis since the uprising against israeli rule of the 
west bank and gaza strip began in december 1987 thirtyeight 
israelis have died 
the army spokesman said the military sealed rooms in three gaza 
homes owned by arabs accused of membership in popular 
committees attacking arabs who cooperated with israel and 
threatening an arab policeman who worked with the military 
authorities 
israel says sealing or demolishing homes is necessary as a means 
of deterrence the army has sealed or demolished at least 330 home 
in the occupied territories during the uprising against israeli 
occupation 
the united states and european nations have condemned the 
measures as violations of human rights 
palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip were ordered to 
boycott their jobs in israel starting friday to protest the new id 
cards israel radio said some arab workers spent thursday night in 
israel to avoid crossing the checkpoint 
israeli officials said they introduced the cards to prevent arabs 
with criminal or security records from entering israel but 
palestinian reporters said the new system is an attempt to put 
economic pressure on gazans who work in israel

the government demanded friday that 
hungary pay damages for the decision to suspend work on its part of 
a joint danube river dam project because of enviromental concerns 
pointing out the damages caused by the delay of construction 
works the czechoslovak side announces it will start seeking 
compensation said a statement carried by ctk the official news 
agency 
it said the hungarian embassy had been given a foreign ministry 
note saying responsibility for the onesided decision of the 
hungarian government is fully on the hungarian side as it was 
adopted in contradiction to international law 
it did not say how much compensation would be sought or give 
other details 
hungary announced a moratorium may 13 on its part of the 
gabcikovonagymaros project which involves dams canals and power 
stations 
environmentalists in hungary one of the most liberal soviet bloc 
nations and in the west have criticized the power project for years 
as a threat to wildlife and wetlands 
there has been no public criticism in czechoslovakia which 
tolerates litte dissent 
before the suspension a hungarian government commission called 
gabcikovonagymaros a symbol of hungarys mismanaged past 
czechoslovakia says the power station it has nearly completed at 
gabcikovo 40 miles east of bratislava cannot operate as 
efficiently as planned without the nagymaros dam 
the note confirms the czechoslovak governments decision of may 
15 to insist on honoring the agreement to construct the 
abovementioned water project ctk reported 
the agreement to build the project was signed in 1977 hungarian 
construction lagged far behind the czechoslovaks even before the 
suspension

tourists have been evacuated from the 
resort island of thassos in the northern aegean because of a fire in 
its mountain woodlands officials said friday 
ferryboats have been plying back and forth and just about 
all visitors have left the island said christos panagis a harbor 
officer in kavala on the mainland 90 minutes from thassos by boat 
a police officer reached by telephone on thassos said he could 
not say how many tourists were evacuated but the process was orderly 
an athens radio station said kavala fire officials believed the 
fire which started in four places simultaneously was caused by 
arson 
agriculture minister stavros dimas said friday that 25 percent of 
the fires that have destroyed 50000 acres of forest in 10 days were 
started by arsonists 
air currents on the mountainous terrain of thassos made it 
difficult for five firefighting aircraft to dump water on the fires 
moving toward the evacuated villages of sotiros kallirahi agios 
giorgis prinos maries and rahoni officials said 
panagis said flames could be seen from the harbor in limeni the 
islands main town but firebreaks were expected to keep the flames 
away from the town 
thassos was put under a state of emergency thursday soldiers and 
firefighting equipment from throughout northern greece were moved 
in to combat the blaze 
the thassos police officer who would not give his name said 
some barns and abandoned dwellings on the outskirts of villages had 
been burned 
the national forest fire control center would not say how large 
an area had been destroyed by the fire which began early thursday 
but unofficial estimates put it at more than 8600 acres

a federal judge on friday blocked the 
department of veterans affairs from implementing a regulation next 
week on va home loans that the mortgage industry says will leave it 
holding the bag more often when borrowers default 
us district judge george h revercomb said in his preliminary 
injunction that va appeared to have exceeded its legal authority 
when it added the cost of borrowing funds to its formula for 
determining the worth of foreclosed property 
the regulations which had been due to take effect monday would 
change the calculation to arrive at how much the property is worth 
the standard va uses to determine whether it will purchase 
foreclosed properties with vaguaranteed mortgages 
the injunction remains in effect until a full hearing on the 
complaint by the mortgage bankers association can be heard the 
association which represents some 2200 mortgage lending 
institutions said in a statement that the hearing may not take 
place for several months 
this decision signals a victory for mortgage lenders but the 
real beneficiaries will be veterans who will be able to continue to 
have access to lowdownpayment va mortgages said warren lasko 
executive vice president of the organization 
the organization says implementation of the regulation would 
have seriously impaired a program that has successfully served over 
13 million veteran homebuyers 
under the veterans loan program the va guarantees to the 
mortgage lender that it will pay 40 percent or 50 percent of the 
mortgage debt if the borrower defaults the maximum guarantee is 
36000 
until 1984 va bought the foreclosed property in nearly every 
case even when it did not make financial sense to do so 
revercomb noted in his ruling but congress in the deficit 
reduction act required a nobid formula to specify when va 
would purchase the properties 
va under the regulations is required to calculate what the 
property is worth by taking its fair market value the price it 
would command in the real estate market and subtracting a variety 
of costs the va would not repurchase homes that it would end up 
reselling at a loss 
the lawsuit was filed after the va issued regulations july 19 
adding cost of funds to the net worth formula that is the cost 
to the government of borrowing money to buy the foreclosed property 
until it can be resold the association contends this cost is not 
permitted in the formula prescribed by congress 
when the regulation at issue here goes into effect it is 
undeniable that some mortgage bankers will be concretely and 
monetarily injured because the va will purchase fewer foreclosed 
homes than it does now thus placing more of the potential loss on 
the mortgage banker revercomb said 
neither va nor the justice department would comment immediately 
on the ruling 
foreclosure actions on vabacked loans have risen sharply in 
recent years due largely to the real estate slump in texas and 
oklahoma the government national mortgage association an arm of 
the department of housing and urban development says six lenders 
defaulted in 1988 that had financial problems linked to the 
socalled nobids 
the presidents budget message this year estimated the new 
regulation would result in 10 percent fewer property acquisitions 
the industry group says its average loss on a piece of property va 
does not acquire is more than 18000 
according to a general accounting office report in july 
foreclosures rose from 13729 in fiscal 1981 to 43316 in 1987 in 
those same two years va annual losses rose from 51 million to 615 
million gao said 
the industry group says its losses from vas refusal to bid on 
foreclosed property totaled 200 million last year 
the report by gao the investigative arm of congress supported 
the new regulations

the voyager 2 space probe discovered that 
a magnetic field surrounds neptune suggesting the planet is 
enveloped by orbiting radiation belts and has an aurora like earths 
northern lights nasa announced friday 
further study of the magnetic field should allow scientists to 
determine the exact length of a day on neptune believed to be 17 to 
18 earth hours and to gain better understanding of neptunes 
internal structure said mary beth murrill a spokeswoman for nasas 
jet propulsion laboratory 
just as earths magnetic field traps the van allen radiation 
belts neptunes magnetic field also may help create radiation belts 
around that planet scientists dont yet know if that poses a hazard 
to voyager 2s electronic components murrill said 
voyager was 274 billion miles from earth and 592 million miles 
from neptune on friday speeding toward the giant gas planet at 
42236 mph 
the spacecraft was launched in 1977 and explored jupiter in 1979 
saturn in 1981 and uranus in 1986 voyager 2 will make its closest 
approach to neptune at 859 pm pdt on thursday when it flies about 
3000 miles over the cloudtops of the solar systems fourthlargest 
planet 
voyager already has discovered four neptunian moons in addition 
to the two discovered from earth two partial rings or ring arcs 
of debris orbiting the planet and atmospheric patterns similar to 
jet streams and giant cyclones on earth 
discovery of neptunes magnetic field was confirmed friday by 
intense pulselike radio emissions coming from the planets 
vicinity radio waves are generated when highspeed electrically 
charged particles spiral into a planets atmosphere along magnetic 
field lines 
mercury earth jupiter saturn and uranus have magnetic 
fields while venus and mars do not the national aeronautics and 
space administration said in a news release whether pluto has one 
or not is unknown 
a planetary magnetic field is a girdle of magnetic field lines 
that surround a planet the agency said such fields are thought 
to be generated by fluid motion in a planets core molten iron in 
earths core for example 
certain electrically charged particles in space spiral along 
magnetic field lines toward earths poles creating the northern and 
southern lights a magnetic field at neptune means that planet also 
may have auroras nasa said 
scientists hope the magnetic field will allow them to understand 
neptunes internal structure voyager project scientist edward stone 
has said he believes that neptunes hydrogenhelium outer atmosphere 
gradually gives way to a superhot slurry of hot water and rock 
closer to the planets center that would mean that neptune like 
neighboring uranus probably lacks a distinct skysea boundary 
some scientists believe radiation trapped by uranus magnetic 
field bombards frozen natural gas on that planets moons and rings 
to turn them dark in color neptunes magnetic field may cause 
similar radiation darkening of the neptunian moons and ring arcs 
nasa said 
the nature of neptunes radio signal allowed scientists to 
determine the emissions came from a magnetic field not from 
discharges of lightning in the atmosphere said james warwick head 
of voyagers radio science team 
the radio emissions are very intense very impulsive and occur 
in a limited range of frequency warwick a scientist at boulder 
colobased radiophysics inc said in the release 
once nasa confirmed the existence of neptunes magnetic field 
friday scientists found evidence for the telltale radio signals in 
data collected by voyager as early as monday 
early analysis indicates neptunes magnetic field is of an 
intensity similar to the fields of earth and uranus nasa said 
murrill said scientists dont yet know how neptunes magnetic 
field is aligned voyager found the axis of uranus magnetic field 
was tilted about 60 degrees from the axis around which that planet 
spins 
earths north magnetic pole is tilted about 14 degrees from the 
planets north rotational axis

pittston coal group inc suspended 
negotiations friday with the united mine workers for 10 days because 
of escalating attacks on company employees and destruction of 
company property the company said 
president michael odom said their workers are subjected daily to 
threats of personal injury and physical violence 
meaningful negotiations are impossible when one party is 
employing fear and terrorism as its principal negotiating 
technique he said 
earlier this week two pittston employees were injured when they 
were hit by rocks as they were driving home from work two employee 
vehicles were burned a company building was destroyed by fire and 
numerous coal trucks were damaged according to state police 
odom said one of the employees was still hospitalized friday 
after suffering compound fractures of his fingers a broken nose and 
multiple cuts and bruises 
no one had been arrested in the incidents but odom blamed the 
union for the violence 
while giving lip service to nonviolence the union has yet to 
take any public steps deploring the acts of violence or to 
discipline agents or members for the thousands of violent acts that 
have occurred since the strike began april 5 odom said in a 
statement released from his lebanon office 
umw president richard trumka in washington dc said pittston 
was avoiding its obligation to help settle the contract dispute 
the company has been trying to find a way to walk away from the 
mediation process and pittston is using this gesture as a 
subterfuge to continue its pattern of badfaith bargaining trumka 
said 
he said the union remains ready and willing to continue 
mediation 
contract talks were to have resumed tuesday at a motel in 
duffield there had been no progress in the negotiations in which 
the union and company representatives gathered in separate 
conference rooms with a federal mediator relaying messages 
us district judge glen williams who initiated the resumption 
of negotiations july 18 after they broke off in june said tuesday 
he was optimistic the parties would soon be meeting and get the 
talks off dead center 
odom said the union should be willing to denounce the violence 
and to instruct its members that strike benefits will be withdrawn 
from those involved in the violent acts to do less would amount 
to a tacit approval 
the strike involves pittstons 1695 union workers in virginia 
west virginia and kentucky

one quarter or more of the earths species of 
animals plants microbes and fungi will become extinct without 
measures to preserve them a national science foundation study said 
friday 
the study called for increased efforts in basic research and 
education in an effort to preserve both individual species and 
complete ecological systems 
unless the international community can reverse the trend the 
report said the rate of extinction over the next few years is 
likely to rise to at least 1000 times the normal background rate of 
extinction and will ultimately result in the loss of a quarter or 
more of the species on earth 
the report said that about 14 million species throughout the 
world have been identified and named but it estimated that the 
total number of species may range from 5 million to 80 million 
in the tropics and subtropices the study said there are 400000 
identified species but the actual number of species in those 
regions may be at least 3 million and perhaps as high as 30 million 
the report called for increased efforts to identify and classify 
the worlds animals plants microbes and fungi and to understand 
the ecosystems in which they live it called for greater support by 
the federal government of such scientific studies 
the nsf study also recommended greater efforts in education 
noting that teaching the young about biology and the environment 
is now as important to the national interest as early education in 
mathematics and other sciences

an appeals court agreed friday to a hold 
a new trial next month for the man convicted in the slaying of prime 
minister olof palme the national tt news agency said 
christer pettersson was sentenced to life in prison last month 
after his conviction pettersson a 42 year old with a lengthy 
criminal record denied shooting the fourterm prime minister and 
appealed 
the prosecution also appealed because it wanted to convict 
pettersson of attempted murder in the wounding of palmes widow 
lisbeth in the attack in february 1986 pettersson was convicted of 
the lesser charge of endangering mrs palmes life 
in sweden reviews by appellate courts are automatic if either 
side appeals but the appellate court has the choice of either 
recalling witnesses or simply reviewing the records of the lower 
court 
the makeup of the appeals court differs from the district court 
in that a majority on the jury are professional jurists and a 
minority are lay jurors 
in the district court the six lay jurors voted to convict 
pettersson and the two judges voted to acquit 
the new trial will begin sept 12 in the svea court of appeals 
the tt news agency said 
palme was shot feb 28 1986 while walking home from a movie with 
his wife 
mrs palme claimed she saw pettersson a few feet away immediately 
after her husband was shot 
another witness however testified he saw pettersson at a train 
station nowhere near the scene of the shooting a short while after 
the murder 
defense attorney arne liljeros said a new witness who did not 
testify at the first trial also claims to have seen pettersson at 
the train station

politburo member alexander yakovlev conceded in an 
interview published today that there was no doubt that the soviet 
union and nazi germany secretly agreed to divide eastern europe 
yakovlev who heads a parliamentary panel charged with finding 
the truth about the 1939 molotovribbentrop pact is the first 
member of the ruling politburo to reverse decades of kremlin denials 
that secret protocols dividing poland and the baltic states existed 
there was without doubt a collusion he told the communist 
party daily he said the agreements should be unequivocally 
condemned 
the issue is at the heart of a drive by latvia lithuania and 
estonia to gain more independence from the soviet union by 
challenging the legitimacy of its control over the baltic region 
yakovlev echoing an approach taken in the past few weeks among 
soviet historians denied that the secret pact had any bearing on 
the baltic states current legal status 
it is necessary to admit that neither the treaty nor protocol 
determined the legal and political status of lithuania latvia and 
estonia he said it is even more farfetched to seek some kind 
of interrelation between the present status of the three republics 
and the nonaggression treaty 
i believe that well be acting responsibly and in a politically 
principled way by having unequivocally condemned the prewar soviet 
leaderships deviation from leninist principles of foreign policy 
no matter how it is explained he added 
soviet history books contend the baltic republics voluntarily 
joined the soviet union the united states subscribes to many balts 
claims that they were forced into the union by the occupying red 
army and does not recognize the baltic annexation 
the republics plan a series of protests and other events to 
commemorate the anniversary of the pact on wednesday including a 
human chain stretching from estonia to lithuania 
yakovlevs commission has not issued its formal conclusions but 
members have said publicly the report will say the protocols existed 
and condemn them 
for decades the soviet union denied the existence of the secret 
protocols to the nonaggression pact which was signed by foreign 
ministers joachim von ribbentrop and vyacheslav molotov one week 
before germany invaded poland 
president mikhail s gorbachev told the congress of peoples 
deputies in june that it was difficult to form a conclusion on the 
protocols because no one had been able to locate the original 
documents

greece will participate in one nato 
military exercise later this year but not another one because of its 
dispute with fellow nato member turkey the athens news agency 
reported friday 
the semiofficial agency quoted defense ministry sources as saying 
greece would take part in the north atlantic treaty organizations 
deterrent force exercise in the western mediterranean from oct 
9nov 14 
the sources who were not identified said greece will not 
participate in the display determination maneuvers in late 
september and early october in the eastern mediterranean black sea 
and certain parts of turkish territory because of the exclusion of 
the greek island of limnos from the exercise 
greece has refused since 1985 to join in any nato exercises in 
the aegean that excludes limnos off turkeys western coast 
turkey claims limnos has been militarized in violation of a 1922 
treaty but greece claims that treaty was annulled by another treaty 
in 1936 
other countries scheduled to take part in the deterrent force 
operation are the united states italy and turkey

a woman who disappeared after being accused 
of killing her lover 21 years ago only to be found earlier this 
year was sentenced friday to one to three years in prison for 
manslaughter 
its all over now except for her to do her time assistant 
states attorney joe collina said after bernice van heise 63 was 
sentenced by lake county circuit judge harry hartel jr 
ms van heise will be eligible for parole in nine months the 
lake county prosecutors office said 
ms van heise who lived quietly for years as wife and mother 
gretta knickerbocker said she had mixed feelings about the guilty 
plea she entered last month in the jan 31 1968 shooting death of 
eugene douglas 
i did it for all my children in their new lives she told 
reporters in this county seat nearly 25 miles north of chicago i 
didnt want them dragged through this thing 
prosecutors agreed to drop murder charges in exchange for ms van 
heises guilty plea 
we didnt pursue murder charges because some of the evidence 
was old and some of the memories were beginning to fade collina 
said 
in 1968 douglas and ms van heise had been having an affair for 
about a year prosecutors said douglas a 48yearold glenview 
artist was shot when he told his lover he was leaving her to return 
to his wife and children prosecutors said 
she claimed that the shooting was an accident and that she was 
handing the gun to douglas when it discharged and he was shot 
assistant states attorney michael waller said friday strangely 
he was shot in the back of the head 
douglas widow pat douglas and her two daughters were in court 
for the sentencing theres no way that anybodys going to make up 
for what happened she said but im very happy its been taken 
care of 
shortly after douglas death a judge rejected the filing of a 
murder charge on the basis of insufficient evidence 
a grand jury later indicted ms van heise on murder charges but 
she had disappeared the indictment was withdrawn in 1975 
investigators took up the case again after a friend of ms van 
hieses daughter was overheard discussing the case 
ms van heise was reindicted in february after authorities 
located her in the rural town of elburn about 40 miles west of 
chicago she and her husband of 20 years conrad knickerbocker had 
moved there in 1976 from the chicago suburb of hinsdale

a trans world airlines md80 airliner landed 
safely friday at lambert st louis international airport after an 
engine came apart on takeoff and a twofoot piece of it narrowly 
missed a man on the ground 
i heard a large explosion and then i heard a lot of debris 
hitting the roof said mark erp 29 manager of an auto body shop 
in kinloch next to st louis lambert airport 
then a big hunk came through the roof and hit the floor about 
10 or 15 feet from me he said i had been walking that way 
needless to say i just dived away i didnt know if there was more 
coming 
officials said flight 223 from st louis to san francisco had 
just taken off about 1015 am when passengers heard a loud pop and 
the pilot announced that the plane was returning to the airport the 
plane made a routine landing and there were no injuries said twa 
spokesman don morrison 
morrison said the flight was canceled and the 112 passengers 
were put on another flight 
morrison said the engine was designed to eject loose parts to 
minimize problems we understand some pieces fell and were 
investigating morrison said 
morrison said the engine part that fell was a cone the rear 
cover for one of the planes pratt amp whitney engines 
fred farrar a federal aviation administration spokesman in 
washington said a piece of cowling that wraps around the engine 
apparently came off 
farrar said the plane could have been flown safely without the 
cowling but that the pilot probably did the right thing by aborting 
the flight given the fact that we have 19000 flights per day in 
this country we may have one report like this a month farrar 
said 
morrison said the plane was being examined to determine the cause 
of the engine failure 
erp said the engine part that fell into his shop was a metal cone 
about 2 feet long that weighed about 15 pounds he said it ripped a 
5footsquare hole in the roof of the building 
we started to pick it up but it was red hot he said it 
was still too hot to touch about 30 minutes later 
erp said twa officials who reclaimed the debris were at the shop 
only briefly they just took the cone and picked up some smaller 
pieces and left erp said they didnt say a whole lot i guess 
they didnt want to talk about it

nine laotian children orphaned by the 
murdersuicide of their parents following a tense 6hour hostage 
drama were in the temporary custody of relatives friday authorities 
said 
church and county counselors said they have begun to look for 
permanent homes for the youngsters 
bao cha mother of the children ages one to 13 was fatally shot 
thursday evening by her husband dang cha xiong who then put the 
handgun to his own head as eight of their nine children huddled in 
another room of their apartment 
the ninth child a 12yearold boy fled from the apartment 
earlier through a window and alerted police that his father was 
inside with a handgun threatening his mother and playing russian 
roulette with the other children 
none of the children was injured 
deputy police chief lucian neely said dang 35 had been 
convicted last year of two misdemeanor counts of abuse and cruelty 
to his children and was prohibited under the terms of his probation 
from visiting his wife or children 
neely said dang served four months in county jail on the original 
cruelty charges and that he was returned to jail twice since then 
in january and again in june for violating terms of his probation 
by visiting his family 
dang had been released from jail on the most recent probation 
violation on monday and neely said investigators believe that he 
went to his wifes apartment thursday because he blamed her for his 
probation violation arrest 
theres no way i can ever say what the motive was but the 
timing suggests something related to that the deputy chief said 
of the probation violations 
more than 50 officers surrounded the home in a neat apartment 
complex populated largely by asian refugee families near the 
university of the pacific campus hostage negotiators talked with 
dang by telephone for several hours 
neely said dang sounded cooperative on the telephone but after 
dang said he would surrender and lay down his gun police heard four 
shots 
officers rushed the apartment and found the children in a front 
room and the two wounded parents in a rear bedroom the mother was 
pronounced dead within minutes and the father about two hours later 
police did not fire any shots during the siege neely said 
neely said officers originally believed that several of the 
hostages were children of neighbors but that later interviews with 
family members confirmed all nine were dangs children 
he said the children spent thursday night with relatives and 
that county child protective services officers and representatives 
of churchrelated refugee services agencies were jointly taking 
responsibility for arranging permanent placement of the children 
stockton has a large community of refugees from southeast asia 
served by several public and volunteer social service agencies 
five stockton children killed last jan 17 by a deranged gunman 
in a school yard were also refugees from southeast asia as were 
most of the 29 children wounded in that attack 
in a statement friday stockton mayor barbara fass noted that 
earlier incident and the image of her city projected by another 
incident involving refugee children 
i think its the media thats giving the city a bad reputation 
its a hostage situation a family feud like that happens 
unfortunately in every major city in the country fass said

springs fire chief pete davis there were shells for about 100 
yards on either side you couldnt walk without stepping on one

stretched 10 miles and traffic was delayed up to two hours schmidt 
said the highway was not fully reopened until all it had been 
cleared of shells more than 14 hours after the accident 
people were kept several hundred yards from the accident scene as 
a fourperson army explosives team recovered 400 of an estimated 600 
unexploded shells schmidt said 
there is no way we could recover everything today he said 
this armament is spread throughout this area 
the truck hauling the ammunition from fort huachuca in sierra 
vista in southeast arizona to the navajo army depot near flagstaff

the whole load came forward crushing the cab schmidt said 
some of the ammunition was thrown the fire was allconsuming 
bailey who was sleeping while his wife drove apparently crawled 
several hundred yards across the interstate to the rock springs 
general store 
by the time officials were able to approach the truck all but a 
few boxes of the ammunition had exploded schmidt said spent 
casings littered the area 
the shipment being hauled under a contract with the military 
originated in san antonio said lt col ed cooke of kelly air force 
base there the 37000 pounds of class d ammunition was taken to 
fort huachuca from a depot at lackland air force base operatated by

chinas grand plans for its 40th national day 
including an impressive military parade have been scrapped 
official reports said thursday 
the celebrations that had been scheduled for oct 1 marking the 
establishment of communist rule over china in 1949 were to have 
been the most elaborate in five years 
beijing mayor chen xitong said no military parade was planned 
this year apparently to avoid reminding people of the tanks that in 
june rolled down the streets of beijing to crush a popular 
sevenweek democracy movement 
in 1984 beijing celebrated the 35th anniversary with a full day 
of festivities in tiananmen square beginning with a twohour 
military parade that included a 1200piece military band 18 
formations of foot soldiers and 24 formations of military equipment 
including antitank missiles rocket minelaying vehicles and 
artillery 
senior leader deng xiaoping reviewed the troops from an 
openroofed red flag limousine and addressed the nation from the 
rostrum of tiananmens northern gate where mao tsetung had 
proclaimed the founding of the peoples republic of china 
a similar display of pageantry was expected this year but 
leaders apparently feel the mood is not right for such a celebration 
martial law enacted on may 20 remains in effect in beijing and 
troops armed with assault rifles have guarded the city since the 
military crackdown on june 34

colin l powell the black general nominated to 
head the joint chiefs of staff credited his rise thursday to equal 
opportunity in the military that he said does not exist in all of 
society 
citing his own nomination and the choice of a woman as first 
captain of the cadet corps at the us military academy powell told 
the national association of black journalists almost all barriers 
have now dropped 
it remains for all society he said to follow the lead of the 
military in providing equal opportunity 
if you look at the armed forces of the united states you see 
the kind of opportunity for advancement that regrettably does not 
exist in every part of our society even within your own 
profession powell said 
it was he said the kind of opportunity that we have led the 
way with and hopefully will eventually spread to all parts of our 
society so that achievement recognition should be a function 
solely of performance 
powell 52 formerly national security adviser to president 
reagan was nominated as the nations most senior military leader by 
president bush last week if confirmed by the senate he would be 
the first black in the job 
powell suggested to the journalists group what he said would 
have been the best second paragraph to news stories on his 
nomination gen powells appointment would not have been possible 
without the sacrifices of those black soldiers who served this great 
nation in war for over 300 years previously 
the real story is that yes i climbed i climbed well i 
climbed hard and i climbed over the cliff he said but always 
on the backs on the contributions of those who went before 
your challenge and my challenge is to tell our young people 
throughout the land black white whatever coloration that theyve 
got to prepare themselves theyve got to be ready 
i may have crossed over and climbed the cliff with the help of 
many others powell said but now that were on top of that 
cliff and looking ahead there are still more rivers to cross and 
our young people have to be ready

a teenager who had accused us rep 
donald lukens of having sex with her was ordered held in custody 
thursday on two charges filed by her mother 
franklin county juvenile court referee jeff liston ruled that 
rosie coffman is out of control and that he would hold her until 
trial 
a trial date was not set but it is to be held within 10 days 
ms coffman 17 was arrested wednesday and charged with criminal 
damaging and menacing based on complaints filed by her mother anna 
coffman of columbus 
the referees decision was made after rosie coffmans first court 
appearance on the charges 
rosie coffmans allegations against lukens led to his may 26 
conviction and subsequent sentencing on a misdemeanor charge of 
contributing to the unruliness of a minor the 58yearold 
republican was sentenced to 30 days in jail and fined 500 by 
franklin county domestic relations court judge ronald solove 
the aggravated menacing charge stemmed from a july 27 incident in 
which rosie coffman allegedly threatened to hit her mother with a 
telephone according to testimony rosie would not get off the phone 
when asked by her mother 
the criminal damaging charge resulted from an incident on aug 13 
at the coffman residence according to testimony rosie coffman 
tried to pry open a door to the house after she was locked out 
rosie coffman was being held in the countys juvenile detention 
center 
the girl and her mother were key figures in lukens trial

at his columbus apartment last november when she was 16 she said 
lukens knew she was underage at the time 
anna coffmans complaint to columbus television station wsyx late 
last year led to an investigation that resulted in lukens 
indictment in february 
she testified that during a meeting with lukens at a fastfood 
restaurant in november lukens offered to find her a government job 
after she confronted him with accusations that he had sex with her 
daughter 
the meeting was secretly videotaped by the television station 
mrs coffman was jailed in june for a probation violation 
stemming from a 1983 drunken driving conviction she was released to 
serve the rest of her 2month sentence at her home where her 
movement is monitored by an electronic band attached to her ankle

there are certainly enough crass venal 
motivations at the networks to go around but to hear some of the 
makers of tv movies talk there are some loftier goals as well 
carl bernstein and bob woodward are allowing a madefortv 
production for abc of their book the final days in hopes of 
reminding people about the constitutional crisis and the personal 
drama behind watergate so maybe theyll make a few bucks too 
prosecutor joe hynes who reaped a lovely free ticket to los 
angeles to sit in a hot room with a lot of tv critics is 
cooperating on nbcs howard beach making the case for murder 
he hopes it will enlighten the public about the muchpublicized case 
of a vicious new york racial attack 
elaine shannon is cooperating with the nbc movie drug wars the 
kiki camarena story based on her book desperados latin drug 
lords us lawmen and the war america cant win in hopes it 
will inspire the public to demand that the government get serious 
about the drug problem 
abc is also making a movie about the challenger disaster rock 
hudsons battle against aids a florida child molestation case and 
the socalled preppy murder a new york sexanddeath case that 
made headlines for months 
theres no question these rippedfromthenews stories make it 
a lot easier for television programmers to go out and market a film 
the audience has heard about them said allen sabinson abcs vice 
president for motion pictures for television and miniseries and 
theres no question we have some predilection to do them and do a 
lot of them the question that were sitting and asking is is there 
a reason to do it that goes beyond simply getting a rating 
number 
some of the movies are made without the permission of the 
reallife participants but are based on material in the public 
domain such as news accounts or trial transcripts 
sabinson said unspeakable acts about the molestation of tots 
at a florida daycare center will serve the purpose of teaching the 
public the warning signs of child abuse challenger about the 
space shuttle explosion aims to educate audiences on the risks of 
technological achievement the preppy murder will try to reveal 
the anguish of the victims family not just because of the crime 
but because of the ensuing publicity whether the family will 
welcome even more publicity in the form of the tv movie remains to 
be seen 
ken kaufman the producer of howard beach said he hopes the 
film will present the facts of the case accurately and let the 
public draw from it what they will 
daniel j travanti portrays hynes in the movie about the 
successful prosecution of a group of white youths charged with 
attacking a group of blacks and chasing one of them to his death on 
a highway 
if it saves the life or if it saves the trauma of one single 
family hynes said its worth it 
drug wars is a reallife tale produced by michael mann whose 
miami vice was a stylized fictional homage to drugfighting 
cops shannon a journalist whose investigative book is an angry 
account of americas antidrug policies and their effect on the 
agents in the field said she was impressed by the authenticity of 
the movie directed by brian gibson 
there are anecdotes that are compressed in time you have to do 
that in order to get it intelligible for television but i am very 
satisfied that the spirit of the story is there and its real 
she said 
mann said the movie will not depict the torture and murder of 
camarena a guadalajarabased drug enforcement administration agent 
killed by traffickers i would never put that scene in he said 
it would be too strong its not to the point what is to the 
point is the peoples reactions to the fact of it 
bernstein attended a news conference with the makers of the 
threehour final days he said he would have preferred that the 
book be made into the stage play but praised the tv movie in which 
lane smith plays richard nixon 
i feel strongly you know that we need to know about what 
happened in this epoch of our history and what this president 
did bernstein said a lot of people in this country dont know 
about it or theyve forgotten about it

if you take the longterm view of investing the 
1990s should be profitable for you 
if for instance you invested 1000 in a good growth stock and 
reinvested the dividends immediately you might expect your 
investment to grow to more than 2500 by the end of the decade 
highcost financial advisers and portfolio managers might brag 
about that result but it is well within the ability of most 
ordinary investors and it need not involve an inordinate amount of 
risk 
for your 1000 to reach that figure would involve a return of 
about 11 percent a year a rate that might not seem very high in 
these days of instant wealth compounding however works wonders 
but compounding takes time 
while any investment involves the risk of loss many conservative 
investors will do much better than that over the longer term such 
as a full decade the percentages are strongly in favor of equity 
investments 
had you invested 1000 back in 1974 and left it there along 
with all the dividends it earned you might have had more than 
5500 by the end of 1988 extraordinary no that was just normal 
in fact during that time the standard amp poors 500stock index 
rose by the very percentage that generated the 5fold increase if 
you had done only as well as the market rather than having beaten 
it you would have had 5622 
that sum was achieved at an annual rate of 12 percent a year 
wright investors service a bridgeport conn adviser and 
portfolio manager that endorses conservative patient longterm 
investing foresees the probability of investors earning around 11 
percent in the next five years 
while history alone might support such an expectation wright 
reasons from the present this is how it arrives at the figure 
based on the standard amp poors 500stock index corporate 
earnings growth should be at a 5 percent to 6 percent compound 
annual rate of growth the average dividend yield is likely to be 
between 35 percent and 4 percent 
these two factors produce a 9 percent rate of earned return but 
economic conditions could add another 2 percent annual appreciation 
via increases in priceearnings ratios or the number of times 
earnings at which stocks sell 
wrights forecast was made earlier this year but the rationale 
still applies the basis for its higher pe multiples is an 
expectation of declining interest rates that it figures justifies 
a pe of 12 to 13 
in other words the market over the next five years is expected 
to roughly equal its longterm performance said wright investors 
accustomed to the high returns typical since 1982 will have to scale 
back their expectations 
scale back their expectations yes in order to raise 
expectations about their returns as longterm investors know 
scaling back longterm expectations to 11 percent means more money 
in the bank than scaling up shortterm dreams 
based on the past the norm isnt bad it can raise your 
investment to 25 times its original value in less than a decade 
acting with prudence many investors can do better than the norm 
and some will do very much better 
while the past is a guide nobody can say with certainty what the 
1990s will mean for investors the character of decades has been one 
of uniqueness rather than similarity and the 1990s are likely to 
follow in that pattern 
way back says wright it was the roaring twenties followed by 
the threadbare thirties then came the fighting forties 
we sailed through the fabulous fifties built dreams in the 
speculative sixties and paid for our excesses in the stagnant 
seventies and the 1980s were still trying to figure them out 
theyre the enigmatic eighties 
longterm investors are now trying to get the measure of the 
1990s they cannot see to the end of the decade but as the 
beginning nears they are hoping for normalcy they want it to be the 
normal nineties normal will do

the islanders say jon frum is a spirit who appeared as an 
american soldier in world war ii and handed out supplies to the 
people of tanna one of the chain of islands that make up vanuatu 
no trace of a jon frum has been found in us military records 
the villagers live in grass huts have no electricity or running 
water and few posessions but they have never forgotten the 
americans in world war ii and the fabulous cargoes of clothing 
vehicles soft drinks gum candy cigarettes and canned food they 
brought with them on their way to fight the japanese 
the people of jon frum village and thousands more on this densely 
jungled island of 17000 melanesians believe if they can find the 
right magic the americans will return and bestow them with wealth 
meaning cargo 
the jon frum movement is one of several socalled cargo cults 
that exist in melanesia a group of islands stetching from new 
guinea to new caledonia 
they believe the cargo they see arriving by ship and plane was 
sent to them by their ancestors but white mans magic has kept them 
from getting it 
cults like the jon frum society are always on the lookout for 
help from a powerful man who may have strong magic 
one cult on tanna worships the duke of edinburgh the husband of 
queen elizabeth ii and believes he originally came from tanna they 
think he has the power to help get them cargo 
in new guinea a cult sought to buy president lyndon b johnson 
because they had been told he was the most powerful man in the 
world since his name was on all the johnson outboard motors they 
used on their canoes they saw little reason to doubt the claim 
the jon frum movement is one of the oldest of vanuatus cargo 
cults its origins are obscure some anthropologists say it may 
actually date back to the 1930s and could have arisen as a reaction 
to missionary efforts to abolish traditonal customs such as polygamy 
and drinking kava a potent local brew 
the movement got a powerful boost during world war ii when many 
tannese were sent to other islands to work for the americans who 
used the islands then called new hebrides as a staging base in 
their pacific campaign 
when the tannese saw black american soldiers handling cargo and 
getting food and supplies like the white man they were impressed by 
their magic 
at this time according to studies of the cult the tannese 
believe jon frum reappeared as a black medical corpsman 
the movement adopted the red cross as their insigna they planted 
dozens of wooden red crosses at the foot of their volcano in the 
hope this would encourage the return of jon frum and the cargo 
after the americans moved on a tannese declared himself king of 
america and built a crude airstrip in the jungle with a bamboo 
replica of a control tower and radios made of tin cans and 
string hoping to attract planes to land as they had seen them land 
at us air bases 
others built copies of refrigerators opening the doors several 
times a day hoping to find cold beer the way they amercians had done 
the british and french who jointly governed the new hebrides 
until 1980 outlawed the cult and frequently jailed its leaders 
the national government that followed also curbed its activities 
but the jon frum movement continues to flourish on this dark 
rugged island dominated by the smoking 900foot volcano whose ash 
is slowly choking large areas of onceproductive coconut plantation 
around the village 
friday is the cults sabbath and followers meet at sulphur bay 
they dance and drink kava on saturday night by sunday they are too 
tired to go to the missonary church 
jon frums followers expect him to return each feb 15 but they 
dont know which year and they dont get despondent when he doesnt 
appear 
chief isaac wan headman of the jon frum village tells visitors 
that christians waited a long time for the redeemer

maryam dabo winged here in the dead of night 
to talk about her role as a vampire in a new movie for usa network 
her flight during a break in filming a miniseries in england 
was by jet 
her character angelique in nightlife is too much of a 
reluctant vampire to spread her wings even for a transylvania 
transfusion 
in the movie which debuts on wednesday shes hiding out from an 
amatory vampire named vlad played by ben cross 
shes trying to escape not only from vlad but from being a 
vampire said dabo its offbeat usually vampires enjoy being 
vampires she wants to get rid of it if she can 
nightlife is strictly fang in cheek although its not as 
broad as love at first bite its closer to that than to 
dracula 
angelique lives in a condo with a maid so ditsy she doesnt 
notice her boss sleeps in a coffin 
it opens with angelique arising from a sleep of 100 years when 
her grave in mexico city is dug up she collapses and is rushed to 
the nearest blood bank for a pickmeup the doctor in charge 
played by keith szarabajka believes she is suffering from a rare 
blood disorder they fall in love and vlads wrath turns into a 
blood feud 
the movie looks at how modern medicine would view a vampire 
which would be as a disease and how an ancient vampire would look 
at modern medicine which would be with contempt 
dabo took a week out from her leading role in the usa network 
miniseries not a penny more not a penny less to come here to 
promote the comedy thriller in 1987 she costarred in the living 
daylights with timothy dalton making his first film as james bond

olivia dabo of the wonder years 
maryam was last seen here as an alien from another planet in the 
nbc miniseries something is out there and its spinoff series of 
the same name joe cortese also starred as an earthbound policeman 
the problem was that the series just couldnt find its style 
she said joe and i were hoping it would follow the comedy style 
of the miniseries but theres always a fear youre not entertaining 
the audience if you dont have a lot of action its a way of 
playing it safe i believe in stories first i know now the hardest 
writing is series writing theres no time 
not a penny more is a twopart fourhour miniseries based on 
the novel by jeffrey archer a corrupt financier played by ed asner 
swindles four innocent investors who devise a scheme to recover 
their money dabo plays asners daughter who disapproves of her 
fathers financial dealings and is romantically involved with one of 
his victims the filming will continue until october 
dabo was born in london to a british father and a russian 
mother the name is finnish her fathers ancestors reached england 
more than 600 years ago quite probably in a viking longboat 
after her parents divorce she was brought up in paris and 
geneva where her first language was french her mother was the head 
of unicef greeting cards in europe 
i started acting in amateur high school productions she 
said i wanted to be an artist however and attended the london 
college of printing it was too technical and i switched to the 
drama centre in london we called it the trauma centre 
soon after getting her union card which enabled her to work 
professionally she left the school her first role was in the cbs 
miniseries master of the game she played dominique an artists 
model hired by dyan cannon to influence her son to give up his 
ambitions of becoming a painter harry hamlin played cannons son 
hopefully in 20 years when i can consider myself a respected 
actress ill go back to being an artist she said its a very 
soothing hobby in the meantime i just do sketches and 
caricatures

the national transportation safety board now 
in its second year under an acting director is struggling to cope 
with a shrinking investigtive staff and a tight budget as it tries 
to learn the causes of the nations worst air sea and ground 
accidents 
four congressmen say the situation is worsening and recently 
wrote president bush asking him to nominate a director as a first 
step in rebuilding morale and retaining the agencys reputation as a 
leading safety advocate 
more pointedly a top ntsb official has complained that his 
investigative staff may dwindle so much by years end that the 
agency will have to curtail by onethird the 3000 or so accident 
investigtions it undertakes each year 
the bureaus situation is critical and worsening wrote the 
official herbert banks the ntsbs field operations director 
criticism of the agencys actions or lack of them also comes 
from former employees who charge that the acting chairman james 
kolstad is afraid to make waves within the government or in the 
industries his agencies is supposed to watch over 
kolstad has been acting director since aug 14 1988 after jim 
burnett failed to win senatorial approval for a fourth twoyear term 
as chairman 
burnett who had acquired a reputation as a strong independent 
safety advocate is widely believe to have angered sen wendell 
ford dky and the chairman of the senate aviation subcommittee 
with a speech blasting fords proposal to separate the federal 
aviation administration from the transportation department 
burnetts renomination languished without the senate even holding 
a hearing into the matter 
since then kolstad has become the target of criticism that he 
has not dealt with morale problems has not pushed for increases in 
the ntsbs 254 million budget and has not stopped the outflow of 
investigators 
recently four ranking members of the house space science and 
technology committee told bush that he should nominate a chairman 
we believe that continued uncertainty may have a detrimental 
effect on the activities of the board and its respected leadership 
role in transportation safety said the letter the congressmen 
said low morale could lead to the loss of valuable expertise and 
experience 
it was signed by rep robert roe dnj the committees 
chairman rep robert walker of pennsylvania the ranking 
republican rep tim valentine dsc chairman of the panels 
transportation subcommittee and rep tom lewis rfla the 
subcommittees ranking gop member 
for his part kolstad said in an interview that he believes 
morale is better than it was when he took over but he added 
there is a concern that we have people in an acting capacity 
because it suggests that a lot of change that might otherwise occur 
cant occur there is frustration among some staff people its in 
everyones interest that the matter be resolved 
burnetts supporters speaking anonymously maintain that while 
bush may favor burnett a longtime political supporter and campaign 
activist for bush in arkansas some white house advisers dislike 
burnetts outspokeness on safety issues 
these sources maintain that there has been extensive industry 
lobbying to keep kolstad a former public relations vice president 
for frontier airlines as chairman 
as for the future of the boards investigations banks the field 
operations director projected in a may 11 memo that six more 
investigators would quit by the end of the year making the ntsb to 
unable to live up to its congressional mandate to investigate all 
airplane crashes 
his memo forecasting that the agency would have to cut the 
number of accidents it investigates a year by 900 never made it to 
the board it was sent back by the boards staff director lloyd 
miller preventing the issue from being debated by the board and 
perhaps being aired at a public hearing 
miller like kolstad disagreed with the severity of banks 
assessment and thought the situation not serious enough to be put 
before the board banks declined to discuss the memo with a reporter 
for his part kolstad discounted banks concerns as overly 
pessimistic and said no major investigations or critical safety 
problems would be affected at the ntsb which examines airplane 
crashes sea disasters major highway accidents and pipeline breaks 
there has been a cutback in investigations kolstad said 
but frankly weve got fewer accidents the accident rate is 
improving that doesnt suggest we have enough people to investigate 
the accidents that exist because we dont but i think were doing 
a better job on the ones that we are investigating 
major investigations now under way include two recent incidents 
involving explosive engine failures in dc10s other airliner 
accidents oil spills in alaska and elsewhere and several freight 
train derailments 
over the last decade the ntsbs staff has been reduced from more 
than 400 to 324 with many key investigators leaving for 
higherpaying private jobs 
some ntsb staff members praise kolstad as personable and 
competent private air safety consultant charles miller once the 
ntsbs director of accident investigtions describes the acting 
chairman as a fine individual who recognizes his limitations 
others once associated with the agency have a different opinion 
kolstad is a caretaker who doesnt take care of the board 
said former ntsb public affairs director ira j furman a woodmere 
ny lawyer who stays close to transportation safety issues and 
still visits accident sites as a media consultant 
furman who left the board in 1987 when burnett was chairman 
said kolstad has failed to push hard within the bush administration 
for a bigger agency budget 
j peter kissinger who resigned from the agencys staff last 
week after being shifted from managing director of the staff to a 
job with considerably less responsibility said kolstad doesnt 
want to rock the boat 
while the ntsb has no regulatory power of its own it is the 
governments primary accident investigation agency and makes 
recommendations to congress other agencies and transportation 
industries 
burnett and kolstad have sharply different styles and are often 
at odds on safety issues the former chairman is sometimes the only 
dissenter on the board the acting chairman has been low key rarely 
taking strong positions in open meetings 
critics of the ntsb cite several incidents as evidence of 
problems 
the board failed to investigate the complaint this spring of 60 
air traffic controllers in cleveland who signed a petition citing 
highaltitude air traffic chaos and calling for steps to 
alleviate the hazardous environment 
lloyd miller the acting managing director headed off the 
petition before it reached the board contending it would be a bad 
precedent to investigate what might be a labormanagement problem 
kolstad was the board member assigned to the exxon valdez oil 
spill but did not go to alaska to head the investigation 
kolstad answered that charge be saying that he has been very 
active in the inquiry and that he decided not to go because other 
high government officials were going and he did not see the need for 
sending another big name to the scene 
while imposing a hiring freeze to meet its budget the board 
held a meeting for top personnel in miami and the acting chairman 
made two official trips to europe 
kolstad said that the miami meeting provided important dialogue 
with industry representatives and that the board had gotten a good 
deal on hotel accommodations and other expenses he said both 
european trips were worthwhile and part of his official duties

bob hall was a rebel without a car 
hall longed for a stylish affordable convertible that would 
recapture the sheer driving fun offered by british sports cars of 
the past one he says with a soul 
but britain wasnt making them anymore detroit wouldnt it 
seemed unlikely that halls bosses at mazda the japanese automaker 
would take a gamble on such a car 
halls dream machine however came true the mazda mx5 miata 
the twoseat ragtop with smoothflowing lines is drawing raves from 
car critics and eager customers willing to pay thousands over its 
list price 
i am not suprised that it has gone over very well i am 
surprised by the intensity of the reaction hall said 
he explains its impact in emotional terms its a feeling car 
it feels like its doing everything correctly it works on your 
soul maybe because it has a soul 
hall 36 mazdas product planning manager here and assistant 
chief designer mark jordan 35 have both been pulled over by police 
while taking early spins in the peppy miata but only for reviews 
how do you like the car an officer shouted to jordan after 
drawing alongside ive got one on order 
hall credits similar enthusiasm among his mazda colleagues in 
japan and america with helping to persuade company management to 
build the car 
it was in the late 1970s while hall was working as a writer for 
an auto publication that he first suggested to a mazda executive 
that the firm consider making an affordable sports car similar to a 
triumph or an austinhealy 
i was raised in these quality bits of british workmanship my 
father owned a bunch of sports cars and he would throw us in the 
back seat i remember the wind blasting through my hair said hall 
he was hired in 1981 at mazdas north american research and 
development facility in irvine 40 miles south of downtown los 
angeles and started lobbying from within 
anytime anyone would come from japan i would get on the 
soapbox and talk to them about it said hall 
mazda executives gradually came around hall said backing the 
decision was research material compiled by colleague jim kilbourne 
showing that an american and international market existed for a 
twoseater 
hall and jordan say they wanted to produce a car that combined 
british style and driving allure with japanese reliability and value 
but they say they knew there had to to be something more 
intangible 
its not just a car people are buying theyre buying a 
philosophy a little emotional statement hall said 
the car has to be a kickinthestomach car a 
peoplewilleitherhateitorloveit car you dont make anything 
thats really worthwhile if you make it so everybody likes it 
hall said he thinks thats why the miata despite its instant 
appeal to americans didnt roll off an american assembly line 
detroit is in detroit and therein lies the problem he said 
he recalled a conversation in which the chairman of one of the big 
three automakers whom he wouldnt identify asked him when are 
people in california going to wise up and stop buying funny little 
cars 
a lot of decisionmakers have the feeling that if the market 
isnt buying what theyre making the market is wrong hall said 
he and jordan who both have relatives working as auto designers 
in detroit say they know the idea has been proposed there thus far 
without success 
toshiko hirai the miata project manager in japan made sure 
the car got through with the purity that we had on paper and thats 
so seldom how the auto industry works jordan said 
the designers and engineers in japan even recorded and analyzed 
the sound of 200 sports car exhaust systems to get just the right 
pitch for the car he said 
all that fervor hall says has produced a treat for drivers 
and for him 
people appreciate it thats my payback seeing all the gents 
and the cutelooking girls out for a spin

the napalmed vietnamese girl in the pulitzer 
prizewinning picture that came to symbolize the atrocity of war is 
planning a trip to america with a message of reconciliation and hope 
phan thi kim phuc was a terrified 9yearold running from her 
napalmed south vietnam village one june day in 1972 when associated 
press photographer nick ut captured her moment of agony for the ages 
the gripping picture appeared on newspaper front pages 
nationwide enshrining kim as a personification of vietnamese 
suffering and ravaging the american conscience 
unseen in the photograph were the ghastly burns her whole back 
and neck and arm were black like barbecue ut recalls 
there was terrible heat i was running running running away 
i tore off my burning clothes but the burning didnt stop i was 
alone with that terrible heat kim told los angeles times magazine 
writer judith coburn on the eve of a scheduled sixweek trip across 
america 
kim and ut met again on july 24 their first meeting in 17 years 
during a brief reunion in havana 
to me shes part of the family said ut whose famous 
picture hangs in the den of his suburban los angeles home i tell 
my children bettina and michael who were born in america how lucky 
they are to escape war 
ut fled vietnam in april 1975 and worked two years in the aps 
tokyo bureau before transferring to the los angeles office where he 
continues to work as a staff photographer 
the havana reunion was a shock for ut the wounded child he 
photographed and took to a hospital in 1972 had grown into a 
beautiful woman the scars on her back chest and arm concealed 
beneath a tshirt 
kim accepted a vietnamese government invitation to go to cuba in 
1986 where she eventually began studies in pharmacology she now 
lives in a student apartment within a havana highrise 
i want to live my life marry have children she said 
adding shes a joyful young woman 
her us visit tentatively set for this fall will attempt to 
soothe lingering bitterness from the bloody southeast asian conflict 
of two decades ago 
if i ever see those south vietnamese pilots who dropped the 
bombs on me or any american pilots i would say to them the war 
is over the past is the past she said i would ask those 
pilots what can they do to bring us all together 
theres such a connection between vietnam and america but it 
would be one of friendship not bitterness not enemies but im not 
coming to america to talk about the war 
im coming so americans can meet the girl in the photo 
the 26yearold woman also wants to see the statue of liberty and 
the golden gate bridge 
if she can forgive why cant anyone asks merle ratner of 
the committee to welcome kim phuc which is sponsoring her trip the 
visit is part of a campaign to normalize usvietnamese relations 
the photograph led gen william westmoreland commander in chief 
of us forces in vietnam to charge uts picture was a fake the 
general said kim had been burned in a hibachi accident 
ut said he had traveled with other journalists to the village of 
trang bang following three days of heavy fighting the napalm that 
routed kim and other villagers fell in the early afternoon as she 
ran the girl cried that her flesh was burning so hot said ut 
kim hopes the trip will raise money for her family in vietnam and 
for her return to the united states to study and get medical 
treatment 
holding her scarred arm next to the untouched one she asks 
dont you think the doctors in america could make them both look 
the same

ending a controversial chapter in the 
governments insider trading probe prosecutors have decided not to 
lodge charges against two wall street executives arrested in 1987 
while a third agreed to a guilty plea 
us attorney benito romano made the announcement thursday after 
a top trader at goldman sachs amp co robert m freeman said he 
would plead guilty to mail fraud as part of an agreement with 
prosecutors 
in hindsight we would have been better advised not to proceed 
with the arrests at such an early stage of the investigation 
romano said 
the charges initially were brought by thenus attorney rudolph 
giuliani and frequently have been cited as an example of overzealous 
whitecollar prosecution by giuliani now a candidate for new york 
city mayor 
freeman was arrested with kidder peabody amp co trader richard 
wigton and exkidder trader timothy tabor in february 1987 an 
indirect result of the ivan boesky insider trading scandal that 
shook wall street three months earlier 
freeman and wigton were seized in their offices as stunned 
colleagues watched wigton was led away in handcuffs 
the government voluntarily dropped the initial charges against 
the trio in may 1987 after a judge rejected requests by prosecutors 
for more pretrial preparation time the us attorneys office 
indicated at the time that it planned another indictment but new 
charges were not brought 
romano told a news conference thursday the government had closed 
its investigation of wigton and tabor without bringing any charges 
its about time they did said wigtons attorney stanley s 
arkin they wrongly and unjustly arrested the man and charged him 
and left him in a state of uncertainty for two years the 
government ought to apologize to him 
a statement released by tabors attorney andrew m lawler 
called tabors arrest a terrible misjudgment 
that decision has caused mr tabor incalculable personal and 
professional damage he said a thorough investigation would 
have established and indeed has established that mr tabor is 
innocent of any wrongdoing 
freeman 47 who also resigned as head of goldman sachs 
arbitrage operation said he decided to plea to end the ordeal of a 
criminal investigation that began 2 years ago 
life has become a nightmare for me and my family freeman 
told the firm in a letter i have been unable to participate in 
the firms activities in a meaningful way 
at an appearance before us magistrate nina gershon freeman 
said he had agreed to plead guilty to one count of mail fraud in 
connection with trades involving the stock of beatrice companies 
inc in early january 1986 
he is to formally enter his plea sept 5 before judge pierre 
leval 
the felony carries a maximum prison term of five years and 
prosecutors are seeking 186 million in fines 
the plea agreement caps a criminal investigation of freemans 
activities with kidder and several other investment firms romano 
said freeman probably will face civil charges filed by the 
securities and exchange commission 
romano also said that under the plea agreement freeman is not 
required to cooperate in the governments investigation of wall 
street corruption he would not comment on whether prosecutors were 
seeking information from freeman 
freeman was implicated by former kidder takeover strategist 
martin siegel who had been fingered by boesky as using illegal 
insider information for stock trades 
freeman said he only knew siegel through business telephone 
conversations i never talked with siegel with the idea of 
influencing any trading decisions by him he said in his letter 
the conversation with him regarding beatrice certainly took 
place and i should not have initiated trading after it he said 
as head of arbitrage the speculative buying and selling of 
stock freeman said he invested heavily in beatrice stock for 
goldman sachs as well as his personal account based on his 
confidence that kohlberg kravis roberts amp cos debtfinanced 
takeover of beatrice would succeed 
the government accused freeman of trading stock on the basis of 
illegal insider information from siegel who represented kohlberg 
kravis in the beatrice deal but freeman said his only involvement 
with siegel was a phone conversation in which siegel confirmed 
rumors that the deal faced difficulties

its products and says it may end up posting a loss in its fourth 
quarter 
the chicagobased company the nations leading manufacturer of 
medium and heavy trucks made the statements thursday in announcing 
a 41 percent drop in thirdquarter earnings 
navistar spokesman bill greenhill said the company had not yet 
determined how many employees would be laid off but he indicated 
the cutbacks would mainly affect the companys springfield ohio 
truckassembly plant which employs 6200 of navistars 15000 
workers 
the decision was just made in the last couple of days and were 
still sorting out the manning requirements greenhill said 
navistar chairman james cotting said in a statement that after an 
increase of 14 percent in the first half industrywide orders for 
heavy trucks declined by 33 percent in navistars third fiscal 
quarter 
industry orders for medium trucks fell 12 percent in the first 
half and 18 percent in the third quarter 
greenhill said the dwindling demand reflected uncertainty among 
navistar customers about the companys future 
truck purchases represent a major capital investment for 
largescale buyers he said 
when there are questions about the economy they just go into 
neutral or defer their purchasing plans greenhill said 
navistar said in response to the slower demand it suspended 
assembly operations monday at its springfield plant for five days 
and at its chatham ontario plant in canada for 10 days 
navistar also said it had cut daily production of heavy trucks at 
chatham from 54 to 49 on july 31 and that it would reduce the 
springfield plants output of heavy and medium trucks by 15 percent 
to 298 per day beginning sept 18 
at springfield one of the two assembly lines will return to 
oneshift operation while two shifts will be maintained on the 
other navistar said 
cotting said the reduced fourthquarter production schedules 
would reduce fourthquarter earnings below the thirdquarter results 
and could even result in a small loss 
navistar reported net income of 28 million or 8 cents a share 
for the three months ended july 31 compared to 47 million or 15 
cents a share in the same period a year ago 
sales for the third quarter totaled 103 billion a 5 percent 
increase over 976 million for the comparable 1988 quarter 
the company said the earnings decline reflected unusually high 
production costs caused by the companys decision to speed up 
assembly operations during the quarter to meet demand for some of 
its newer models

make his air shuttle service a diamond when he bought it from 
eastern airlines but hes settling for false pearls 
female flight attendants employed by trump shuttle are now 
required to wear faux pearl necklaces and earrings as part of 
their uniforms provided by the airline 
its a very nice look trump shuttle spokeswoman joan fudala 
said thursday it does give a very professional look to the 
uniform 
the singlestrand necklaces are about 15 inches long ms fudala 
said she noted that false pearls have been given new respectability 
by first lady barbara bush who has admitted to wearing them 
the spokeswoman said she didnt know the cost of the pearls 
trump shuttle which links new york with boston and washington 
employs 255 flight attendants most of them women their uniforms 
are navy blue with burgundy stripes on the sleeves 
trump who started operating the shuttle on june 8 shortly after 
a federal bankruptcy judge approved the 365 million purchase from 
strikebound eastern has pledged to spend as much as 2 million on 
each plane for refurbishing safety checks and repainting 
i want the shuttle to be a diamond he has said 
the interiors of trumps 21 boeing 727s will be redone in 
burgundy and saddlebrown tones with chrome and maple wood veneer

lavatories will be imitation 
although flight attendants often wear their own jewelry it is 
not considered a mandatory part of the uniform in the airline 
business said barbara steffen a flight attendant for trans world 
airlines 
since most shuttle passengers are more concerned about arriving 
on time than fancy amenities however the flight attendants might 
be casting pearls before swine

steel imports rose in june for the third 
consecutive month but are running sharply below 1988 for the first 
half of the year according to the american iron and steel institute 
us steel exports in june continued to run substantially ahead 
of recent years june exports totaled 403000 tons compared with 
355000 tons in may and 126000 tons in june 1988 
for the first half exports totaled 22 million tons compared 
with 670000 tons in the first six months of 1988 the aisi said 
thursday 
firsthalf imports totaled 87 million tons down 21 percent from 
1103 million tons in the 1988 period the shipments during the 
first half of this year represented 173 percent down from 208 
percent a year earlier 
in june imports fell by 52 percent to 155 million tons the 
united states imported 147 tons of steel in may 134 million tons 
in april and 122 million tons in march the washington dc 
producers group said based on its interpretation of commerce 
department reports 
the june imports represented 183 percent of the domestic market 
may 172 percent april 165 percent and march 144 percent 
president bush on july 18 granted a 30month extension to quotas 
that were due to expire sept 30 the quotas are designed to limit 
imports to 185 percent of the domestic market 
the aisi said the rise in imports coincides with a weakening of 
the world market for steel and confirms the industrys contention 
that other countries increase their exports to the united states 
when business elsewhere softens 
the american institute for imported steel meanwhile said that 
us producers imported 11 million tons of semifinished steel in 
the first half 
without imported steel slab domestic steel producers would be 
unable to meet demand imports of finished steel products also 
benefit us users and distributors by relieving shortages and 
cutting costs said john griffin president of the importers 
association and president of the houston importer maurice pincoffs

the securities and exchange commission has 
subpoenaed several top officials and former employees of egghead 
inc as part of an investigation of allegations of securities fraud 
egghead which owns egghead discount software one of the 
nations largest personal computer software chains said thursday 
the investigation apparently was triggered by a classaction lawsuit 
filed july 18 in us district court in seattle by shareholders 
the suit came after egghead reported nearly 13 million in 
unexpected losses last quarter despite a 50 percent increase in 
quarterly sales 
egghead blamed part of its problems on poor computerized 
accounting systems it said that as it doubled the number of its 
stores in a year it lost millions of dollars in inventory to 
shrinkage theft or other unexplained reasons 
the focus of the sec inquiry appears to be on certain facts 
alleged by the plaintiff in the classaction litigation filed last 
month said matt griffin eggheads executive vice president in 
charge of finance and administration griffin said egghead is 
cooperating with sec investigators 
griffin said egghead has been told by sec staff that the inquiry 
should not be construed as an indication that any law has been 
violated 
it is our understanding that the sec routinely investigates 
matters like these he said 
in the suit shareholder steve goldman alleged he and other 
shareholders were damaged as a result of misstatements in connection 
with the companys initial public offering and statements during the 
period from june 6 1988 through april 24 1989 and later public 
filings 
egghead and its directors are accused in the suit of failing to 
disclose material facts about the companys inventory systems and 
finances at the time eggheads stock went public in june 1988 
egghead says the lawsuit is without merit 
griffin confirmed that egghead founder and chairman victor 
alhadeff was among the officers subpoenaed by the sec 
the seattle times reported thursday that it had learned at least 
two former employees had been subpoenaed and had hired lawyers to 
represent them 
egghead reported a loss of 121 million or 80 cents a share for 
fiscal 1989 on sales of 3424 million

the president and chief operating 
officer of columbia savings amp loan association has announced his 
resignation just 18 months after joining the thrift 
lawrence k fish who said thursday he was resigning effective 
sept 30 comes as columbia tries to devise a new financial strategy 
after congress barred savings and loans from holding junk bonds as 
part of the multibillion thrift bailout 
fish was credited with helping columbia decentralize operations 
with senior managers assuming more responsibility 
but columbia said it no longer needed both a chief executive and 
chief operating officer after the restructuring which was 
undertaken following a period of rapid growth 
columbia last week reported that its secondquarter profits 
plunged to 64 million from 271 million in the same period in 
1988 reflecting a big drop from its securitiesinvestment activity 
fish 44 had a salary of 385000 in 1988 and 15 million in 
bonuses for a total of nearly 2 million columbia chairman thomas 
spiegel was paid 56 million in 1987 and 41 million last year 
siegel said a search was under way for someone to lead columbias 
thrift operations permanently 
the thrift known for its large holdings of highyield highrisk 
bonds has about 30 percent of its 131 billion in total assets 
invested in junk bonds 
but the savings and loan bailout bill signed by president bush 
last week requires thrifts to liquidate their holding in such bonds 
within five years 
columbia has got a real problem on its hands said bert ely 
an alexandria vabased financial institutions consultant 
theyre going to have to do a massive downsizing as they get rid 
of the junk bonds and try to decide just what is going to be their 
business 
columbia also is known for its close ties to california political 
figures and its relationship with former drexel burnham lambert 
inc financier michael milken who was indicted earlier this year on 
securities fraud charges 
milken raised much of columbias junkbond financing and the 
thrift has said it has provided documents to federal investigators 
as part of a continuing probe into milkens activities milken 
headed drexels beverly hillsbased highyield bond department until 
resigning following his march indictment

when generoso pope ruled the national 
enquirer executives often proposed taking the often outrageous 
tabloid beyond american supermarket checkout lines 
the plans always were rejected by a man who often diverted his 
energies to elaborate christmas decorations and meticulous 
landscaping around the publications headquarters here 
but the new owners of the national enquirer and weekly world news 
tabloids say they see no obstacles for expansion plans that include 
spanishlanguage and international editions 
although no formal deals have been made for foreign editions 
talks are continuing with several british publishers including 
robert maxwell who unsuccessfully tried to acquire the enquirers 
publisher gp group inc following popes death in october 
we are looking at a number of possibilities to publish outside 
the united states and mr maxwell is just one of those we have 
spoken with said michael boylan president of macfadden holdings 
inc 
macfadden and boston ventures a mediaoriented investment firm 
paid 4125 million for gp group in april 
the national enquirer which pope purchased from hearst corp in 
1952 for 75000 is the nations leading tabloid with weekly 
circulation of about 43 million the more sensational weekly world 
news sells about 13 million 
murdoch magazines runnerup star sells about 36 million copies 
weekly and globe communications corp reports a total weekly 
circulation of about 32 million from its sun globe and national 
examiner papers 
macfadden owns several romance and teen monthly publications the 
largest of which is true story with circulation of 13 million 
boston ventures last year acquired motown records in a venture with 
mca inc 
macfadden is in early stages of planning a spanishlanguage 
edition targeted for the large hispanic populations in such cities 
as new york miami los angeles and san antonio texas said boylan 
we want it to be basically the same paper but well tailor it 
to include people and celebrities the hispanic community knows and 
follows said boylan who would not predict a date for the new 
edition 
boylan said the united kingdom likely would be the beachhead for 
the overseas expansion which could begin by early next year he 
said other countries such as australia also were being studied 
he described macfaddens proposed foreign tabloids as a 
combination of the stories from the us editions and other articles 
of local or international interest 
while new yorkbased macfadden hasnt tampered with popes 
editorial formula although some other eccentricities have been 
dropped such as a 1 million christmas tree and keeping the company 
grass four inches high analysts have predicted that costcutting 
measures will be needed to cover the high acquisition price 
in june macfadden announced the layoffs of 20 workers from 
editorial advertising and other departments an additional 37 jobs 
were trimmed last month when the news printing operation was 
transferred from pompano beach to atlanta 
the price of the enqurier was raised from 75 cents to 85 cents 
following the purchase and the weekly world news rose a nickle to 70 
cents 
last year the enquirer and news reportedly earned 15 million on 
revenue of about 150 million 
boylan also said macfadden remained interested in launching a 
soap opera publication but had not yet decided on a format or when 
such a publication could appear 
boylan said distribution of the us projects could be handled by 
the companys dsi unit which has nearly 600 full and parttime 
workers managing rack space at about 19000 supermarkets and 
retailers

a new minivan and a sportutility vehicle will 
begin appearing next year in what some may think are unlikely places 
oldsmobile dealerships 
it will be the first time that oldsmobile dealers have marketed 
trucks in the history of the general motors corp division 
oldsmobile cars traditionally have been sold to middleage 
wellestablished consumers minivans and sport vehicles are aimed at 
a younger market 
oldsmobile officials have been trying to change the divisions 
longstanding image mainly through its cutlass line of cars and an 
advertising campaign featuring the slogan this is not your 
fathers oldsmobile 
a fourdoor sportutility vehicle will be made at gms moraine 
ohio plant gm truck amp bus group spokeswoman mary ann tyler said 
thursday 
oldsmobile will sell a version of the new vehicle that is going 
to be introduced as a 1990 model next summer she said adding she 
didnt know what the vehicle would be named 
the moraine plant now makes chevrolet s10 and gmc s15 pickup 
trucks 
previously gm announced that oldsmobile dealers would sell 
versions of its new minivan called the silhouette next year that 
vehicle being made now in north tarrytown ny along with 
chevrolet lumina and pontiac trans sport minivans will go on sale 
later this year 
clifford vaughan vice president and group executive for the 
truck amp bus group said in a recent interview with the oakland press 
of pontiac mich oldsmobile will get a topoftheline version of 
the fourdoor sportutility vehicle 
the company has said it plans to introduce a fourdoor model of 
the chevrolet blazer next year 
analyst kathleen heaney of nikko securities co international 
inc in new york city said she was concerned with badge 
engineering or making minor if any changes in a car and putting 
a different nameplate on it 
they are doing the same thing with the minivan she said 
its going right back to what they used to do making everything 
look alike 
however heaney said the decision to put a sportutility vehicle 
in oldsmobile dealerships may be a good one 
it moves the olds image a little bit upscale and the jeep 
products are expensive she said those are upscale buyers 
maybe thats gms strategy

jim badtkes new farm implement wont 
milk elsie or plow the back 40 but it can identify his most 
productive cows and calculate the best time to water the crops 
badtke is one of a growing number of farmers nationwide who have 
added a personal computer to their collection of tools to make a 
living off the land 
farmers are using computers to help plan their finances manage 
their herds and tell them when to irrigate despite the time it 
takes to learn how to use a computer they say the technology can 
make their operations more efficient and let them reap more profits 
in the uncertain world of modernday agriculture 
badtke said he plans to use his computer to rank his cows so he 
knows which are the most efficient 
by culling cows at the right time we could be saving on feed 
he said noting that he spends about 60000 a year on cattle feed 
thats what youre after to gain more of an edge 
farming is definitely a business it was a business 10 years 
ago but the margins have been narrowed and the costs of being wrong 
are so high that you cant afford to be wrong too often said 
arlin brannstrom assistant director of the north central computer 
institute in madison a resource for agricultural software 
im sure a lot of farms were lost because they didnt have 
enough information he said 
the farm computer business started to sprout around the beginning 
of the decade at the same time the agricultural economy was sliding 
into a recession 
in the 70s there was tremendous expansion in agriculture it 
gave a lot of prosperity to a lot of people said gary randolph 
president of harvest computer systems a farm software company in 
alexandria ind in the 80s things tightened up 
it just happened that this technology came around in the 80s 
he said it was fortuitous the economy created a need and the 
technology filled that need 
estimates vary on the number of farmers using computers john 
brunz executive director of the association of agricultural 
computing companies said numbers range from 8 percent to 20 percent 
the us department of agriculture says 15 percent of farm 
operators in 1988 with gross sales of 250000 or more were using 
computers for record keeping the department says farmers in that 
category accounted for more than half of all farm sales 
the north central computer institute lists about 1900 titles of 
different agricultural software some developed by private companies 
and others by universities 
theres been a very rapid growth brannstrom said 
obviously 10 years ago there was almost nothing on the shelf 
the computer programs range from basic accounting to helping 
farmers tend their crops 
for example researchers at the university of wisconsin this year 
introduced a computer program that tells potato farmers the best 
times to apply pesticides and irrigate 
george rice who supervised the project said the program 
combines principles of horticulture entomology plant pathology and 
agronomy but all a farmer needs to know is simple data such as 
temperatures and humidity 
without such assistance rice said a farmer would be flying in 
the dark 
he might use irrigation when the soil already has water he 
said he might spray when he doesnt have to apply as much 
pesticide 
the program costs about 245 but as rice said it could pay 
for itself with one application of pesticide or one 
misapplication 
the computer program this year saved about 250000 for the rd 
offutt co of fargo nd which owns several potato farms said 
dale steevens an agronomist for the company 
steevens said information from the program allowed operators to 
wait longer before spraying fungicides 
before it was just a best guess based on previous 
experience he said 
farmers also use home computers to tap databases that provide 
uptotheminute information on the weather commodity markets and 
world events that can shape the agriculture economy 
a company that sells such a service is agridata resources inc 
in milwaukee which started in 1981 
ed markham president of the company said until recently 
farmers focused on ways to expand production but theres been 
very little emphasis on marketing the product and running the farm 
as a business 
one of agridatas customers is robert vogts a farmer in 
arlington wis who grows corn and peas 
vogts said while the information is useful in planning youve 
still got to make the decision when to buy and sell 
on one occasion vogts said he was waiting for corn prices to 
reach a recommended target before selling the price came close to 
the target but then dropped quickly and vogts said in retrospect 
he should not have followed the recommendations so strictly 
but vogts and others say computer equipment is well worth the 
investment especially in relation to other farm machinery that can 
cost more than 100000 
a computer investment doesnt compare said norlin hein a 
professor of agricultural economics at the university of missouri 
its about the same price as a used pickup truck and not a very 
good used pickup

investor marvin davis has hinted he may further 
sweeten his 62 billion buyout offer for ual corp after the 
companys board issued a cool response to his overtures and 
confirmed that other bidders have emerged for the parent of united 
airlines 
we are prepared to proceed promptly with our investigation 
in order to determine if a higher price than our 275 per share 
proposal is warranted davis said in a statement today 
meanwhile the wall street journal today quoted sources familiar 
with united as saying texas investor robert bass and a team formed 
by british airways plc and morgan stanley amp co had expressed 
interest in bidding for the nations secondlargest airline 
united declined to confirm the report 
we have said the company has been contacted by various third 
parties but we have not identified any of them spokesman joe 
hopkins said 
the ual board met thursday to review davis offer and released a 
short statement late in the evening saying it was still premature to 
make any decision on whether to sell the company 
the board also confirmed speculation that it had been contacted 
by other potential buyers and that uals financial advisers had met 
with an employee group 
the company statement did not specify which employee group was 
involved and spokeswoman sara dornacker refused to say if it was 
uniteds pilots whose union has expressed interest in buying ual 
ms dornacker also would not identify other potential buyers who 
have surfaced 
davis responded to the meeting with a statement saying he and his 
associates were awaiting with interest the boards conclusions and 
continue to look forward to working with uals board management and 
labor groups to develop a transaction that works to the benefit of 
all parties concerned 
on wednesday davis raised his original 54 billion or 240 a 
share bid to 62 billion davis also said his offer could go 
higher after a review of the companys financial data 
in its statement thursday the board said that all possible 
financial and strategic alternatives should continue to be pursued 
the companys stock which climbed a dizzying 90 per share in 
less than two weeks in anticipation of a bidding war for united was 
up 387 to 27025 a share in early new york stock exchange 
trading today 
davis has filed documents in preparation for a possible proxy

grain and soybean futures prices were mostly 
higher in early trading today on the chicago board of trade 
bolstered by new export business and a private firms surprisingly 
low crop estimates 
the early gains were limited however by forecasts for rain in 
the midwest this weekend and next week 
all the news with the exception of weather is bullish said 
victor lespinasse a trader with dean witter reynolds inc in 
chicago 
among the positive fundamentals were new crop estimates from 
memphisbased sparks commodities inc a private analytical firm 
that were lower than the government projections issued last week 
sparks pegged the us soybean crop at 184 billion bushels 
compared to the agriculture departments estimate of 191 billion 
and sparks pegged the corn crop at 705 billion bushels compared to 
the usdas projected 735 billion 
buying of corn and wheat futures was also stimulated by news that 
mexico had purchased more than 400000 metric tons of us corn and 
that china bought 150000 metric tons of corn and 100000 metric 
tons of wheat 
the sales of us grain to china were the first in two years and 
could portend more business down the road

cent to 2 cents higher with september at 238 a bushel oats were

consumer inflation rose a modest 02 percent in 
july held down by the sharpest drop in gasoline prices in nearly 
three years the government said today 
the increase in the labor departments consumer price index last 
month matched the gain in june together the two reprts showed the 
mildest twomonth inflation picture since julyaugust 1986 and 
marked a sharp contrast to surging prices in the first five months 
of the year 
even with the recent slowdown prices for the first seven months 
of 1989 rose at a 55 percent annual rate more than a full 
percentage point higher than the 44 percent increases in both 1988 
and 1987 
the labor department said the most recent dampening of cost 
pressures reflected drops in prices of gasoline and apparel 
particularly womens clothing and a moderate rise in food costs 
its more good news said economist sandra shaber of the 
futures group a washington consulting firm the overall trend has 
been that the economy is in fact achieving the soft landing 
everyone was hoping for in other words growth is continuing but 
inflation is under control 
in a separate report the department said the moderation in 
inflation produced a 15 percent jump in americans average real 
earnings to 33801 a week it was the largest advance since 
february 1982 and followed a slight 01 percent gain in june 
in reaction to the inflation news the stock market dipped 
slightly in early trading today analysts said traders believed the 
price moderation was not dramatic enough to spur the federal reserve 
board into loosening credit anytime soon 
however in kennebunkport maine presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said we believe inflation is on a downward trend and 
lower inflation should take the pressure off interest rates 
the administration has been pressuring the fed not to choke off 
economic growth which would sharply reduce tax revenue and inflate 
the budget deficit 
gasoline prices after shooting up 212 percent in the first five 
months of the year fell 10 percent in june and dropped an 
additional 22 percent in july the sharpest decline since october 
1986 
however fuel oil costs rose 15 percent last month reversing 
junes decline of 12 percent and natural gas was up 05 percent 
food and beverage costs rose a moderate 03 percent in july 
following a 02 percent june gain that was a moderation from the 
first five months of the year when the lingering effects of last 
years drought sent food prices up at a 93 percent annual rate 
cereal products beverages and sweets all rose substantially but 
they were offset by a 07 percent drop in the index for meats 
poultry fish and eggs 
clothing costs were down 08 percent last month following a 11 
percent decline in june prices for womens and girls apparel fell 
20 percent and those for infants and toddlers dropped 48 percent 
the labor department attributed the declines to largerthanusual 
endoftheseason price discounts for womens clothing 
the price of goods and services other than food and energy rose 
04 percent driven up by a 20 percent gain for tobacco but 
dampened by a 04 percent decline for new cars 
the various changes in july left the overall consumer price index 
at 1244 percent of its 198284 base that means a hypothetical 
selection of goods costing 100 during the base period would have 
cost 12440 in july up 30 cents from june 
the moderation in consumer prices had been expected by economists 
and was sure to be greeted as good news at the federal reserve 
board which had been raising interest rates in order to slow the 
economy and cool inflationary pressures 
in june the central bank reversed course and began pushing 
interest rates down after spotting widespread evidence that the 
economy had softened the recent good news on inflation is likely to 
confirm analysts belief that the feds decision to shift policy was 
warranted 
although inflation in the first six months of the year was the 
worst firsthalf performance since 1982 economists generally expect 
the moderating trend of the last two months to continue 
economist donald ratajczak of georgia state university who 
conducts his own independent price surveys said our preliminary 
projections suggest that inflation may remain subdued in august 
and that when energy prices stabilize in the fall consumer prices 
will return to a 4 percent path 
the federal reserve board according to a report to congress by 
chairman alan greenspan last month is a bit less optimistic than 
private analysts although it agrees that price increases will 
moderate in the second half 
it is anticipating an inflation rate of between 5 percent and 55 
percent for 1989 
the bush administration in a forecast released last month 
predicted an inflation rate of 5 percent for all of 1989 implying 
an annual rate of about 4 percent from july through december and a 
1990 rate of 41 percent 
that was only slightly brighter than the consensus of 50 private 
economists compiled by blue chip economic indicators of sedona 
ariz it forecast a 51 percent increase in costs this year 
followed by a 46 percent rise in 1990

eastern airlines claims its doing so well 
rebuilding from a crippling strike that it will be bigger than 
expected and the carrier may decide not to sell its prized south 
american routes 
american airlines the chief bidder for easterns usually 
profitable latin routes expressed frustration at the lack of 
progress in negotiations on the sale the miami herald reported in 
todays editions 
were discouraged because the talks are so intermittent that 
its hard to define the status said american spokesman ed 
stewart the frustration factor is very real its really not 
clear that they want to sell 
eastern president phil bakes told the associated press the 
carrier will be selling fewer assets than anticipated when it first 
began trying to come back from the strike and chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization 
bakes wouldnt go into details on the south american route 
negotiations and said he didnt want to set odds on whether they 
would be sold 
we have made no final decision to sell south america we have 
been in negotiations we dont have an agreement and our board 
has not made a decision to sell south america bakes said 
we will have more employees it will service more cities and 
well have more airplanes bakes said in an interview 
a pilots union spokesman thursday expressed doubt about bakes 
projections and said eastern is raising safety concerns by rushing 
its rebuilding efforts 
but bakes said management is pleased about easterns progress 
since it announced plans to emerge at twothirds its prestrike size 
from chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization the walkout by the 
airlines three unions began march 4 
what we announced last april was the impossible and there were 
a lot of skeptics to say the least bakes said in the interview 
wednesday the fact is were exceeding targets and we will 
accelerate the schedule a little bit 
bakes detailed the revised increased plans 
instead of 17000 employees planned there will be 
18000plus maybe more 
instead of 1700 pilots planned there will be more in the 
next year or two maybe in the next few months in small groups 
instead of 157 aircraft eastern next year will fly 165 to 180 
planes and also has the first nine of 40 new boeing aircraft on 
order available for 1992 
instead of 800 daily flights serving 77 cities eastern will 
probably add cities and flights but no figures have been decided 
upon 
instead of 18 billion in assets sales the figure may be as 
low as 15 billion fewer assets may be sold because transactions 
such as aircraft sales philadelphia gates and the northeast shuttle 
sale have earned more money than expected and eastern is winning 
back customers at faster rates than expected 
ron cole a spokesman for easterns pilots union noted reports 
that eastern is falling hundreds of millions of dollars behind on 
revenue 
i dont see how he can sit there with a straight face and say 
theyre doing better than anticipated he said 
the air line pilots association which represents pilots at 
nearly every major carrier is considering a nationwide suspension 
of service to show support for easterns strikers the unions 
executive council is in a twoday meeting 
cole claimed eastern flights experienced at least two unsafe 
landings in recent days because of inexperienced pilots 
eastern spokesman robin matell said the company had anticipated 
financial losses throughout this year and that losses have been less 
than expected matell said the unions continue to try to use safety 
allegations as a weapon against the company 
union leaders said eastern also is having trouble keeping up with 
maintenance of its aircraft because it lacks mechanics and spare 
parts 
bakes said 750 to 800 union pilots have crossed picket lines but 
later clarified that about 100 of those are pilots who signed 
preferential recall lists after eastern stopped taking union pilots 
back he said it has graduated 300 new pilots and has 700 in 
training 
alpa contends any union pilot must get job preference over a 
pilot still in training but bakes said eastern is committed to 
protecting the pilots in training

isosceles plc which last month beat rival bidder 
newgateway plc for majority control of british supermarket operator 
gateway corp plc said friday it has reached a truce with its 
rival which still has a 40percent holding in gateway 
under the truce newgateway which comprises us financiers 
wasserstein perella and co and the great atlantic and pacific tea 
co will exchange its holding for a proportionate stake in 
isoceles it will have representation on gateways board of 
directors and will support isosceles in implementing its 
commercial strategy 
newgateway is forbidden to increase its holding above 498 
percent unless isosceles board backs such a move 
newgateway lifted its stake in gateway to the 40percent level 
after losing the takeover contest last month this holding 
represented a potential block to isosceles reorganization plans for 
gateway 
isosceles made up of a group of disgruntled gateway 
shareholders won the contest with a bid valuing gateway at between 
205 billion pounds or 32 billion and 223 billion pounds or 
35 billion

it doesnt take much to shatter deeply held 
convictions on wall street 
just when investors become convinced of one scenario the 
economic winds shift socalled indepth analyses are blown away and 
its time to change strategies 
investors recently got comfortable with the notion that the 
economy was sliding into a possibly severe recession and adjusted 
their portfolios accordingly accumulating socalled defensive 
issues such as food tobacco and soaps 
the new thought is that the economy is stronger than expected as 
suggested by the latest government statistics on everything from 
retail sales and homebuilding to trade and industrial production 
stock strategists are now talking of a revival in cyclical 
stocks those that rise and fall with changes in the economy autos 
chemicals steel metals and paper which fit into this category 
had been depressed lately compared to the rest of the market 
some strategists say the market began to show it was shifting 
gears about two weeks ago with the emergence of phelps dodge corp 
the largest domestic producer of copper at about the time the july 
employment report was released other cyclicals have since followed 
the psychology is that the turndown is getting near the 
bottom said john burnett senior vice president for donaldson 
lufkin amp jenrette if people can justify going out and buying gm 
then they think things are ok 
the july employment report showed joblessness down a notch to 52 
percent and job growth stronger than expected june job growth also 
was revised upward that was followed by unexpectedly strong july 
retail sales last week but the real kicker in the retail sales 
report were the revisions to may and june figures which suggested 
that three months back consumers were actually buying more than many 
investors had realized 
that made an imminent consumerled recession almost impossible 
stock strategists concluded overnight those who days earlier 
warned of recession this year softened their predictions 
subsequent reports on homebuilding industrial production and 
trade led economists to conclude that the economy is in a modest 
expansion 
a market that responds to ancient history as this market has 
done is lacking in longterm conviction said alfred e goldman 
vice president at going 
richard mccabe manager of market analysis at merrill lynch amp 
co says people have lost sight of what the numbers mean 
i wonder why people seem to hang their hats on one number when 
experience shows thats going to change he said 
the numbers rekindled fears in some sectors of a renewed 
inflationary surge investors have scurried to shift their 
portfolios around and change investment strategies 
economist edward yardeni of prudentialbache securities inc 
says the excessive mood swings and volatility are the result of 
shortsightedness brought on by the october 1987 stock market crash 
the crash unnerved a lot of investors yardeni said they 
thought recession and depression but the economy fooled them and 
continued to grow at a very solid pace so investors lost confidence 
and the ability to get a handle on the economy 
the mood swings have been more volatile than the underlying 
economy yardeni is quick to add 
yardeni says despite the market swings he has remained bullish 
throughout the year in recommending rustbowl stocks such as 
chemicals aluminum and steel 
but there is plenty of uncertainty left and the market isnt 
totally convinced yet that defensive stocks are passe for the time 
being many analysts believe the hold some fold some strategy 
is the safest

warner communications inc and chriscraft 
industries inc took a big step friday toward disentangling their 
corporate ties announcing settlement of several legal disputes that 
have blocked the separation 
the relationship was forged several years ago when warner the 
entertainment giant recruited chriscraft to help it fend off 
unwanted takeover overtures 
chriscraft became warners largest shareholder controlling an 
18 percent interest in warner through its majorityowned subsidiary 
bhc communications inc while warner bought a 425 percent stake in 
bhc 
but warner indicated this spring it wanted to sever those ties 
after it agreed to merge with and later to be acquired by media 
giant time inc 
warner dropped its right to match any offer chriscraft may get 
for its stake in warner and gave chriscraft a choice of options on 
what it wanted done with warners stake in bhc 
they have been in court in delaware trying to resolve several 
issues resulting from the warner deal with time and fridays 
announcement described the settlement of some of those legal 
disputes 
the time offer for warner called for a payment of 70 a share in 
cash for half of warners outstanding stock followed by an exchange 
of each remaining warner share for a package of a still undetermined 
mix of cash and securities valued at 70 
under fridays settlement it was agreed that warners interest 
in bhc would be distributed to warner stockholders as part of the 
package of cash and securities comprising the second part of times 
tender offer for warner 
in addition warner agreed to repurchase 13 million of bhcs 65 
million shares of warner series b convertible preferred stock for 
1437 million 
that purchase will leave chriscraft with about 6 percent of 
warners common and preferred stock pending completion of the 
second half of the tender offer 
the settlement also provided that the warner stake in bhc that is 
being spun off to warner shareholders will comprise 40 percent of 
the equity and 625 percent of the voting power in new bhc 
chriscraft controls the rest 
the settlement leaves unresolved chriscrafts assertion that it 
has the right to judge the fairness of the second phase of the 
tender offer for warner because it is the lone holder of warner 
series b convertible preferred stock 
warner contends no such right exists and the dispute remains at 
issue in delaware chancery court

people who habitually leave the headlights on 
the doors locked and the jumper cables at home are target customers 
for a new battery from gnb inc that has a builtin spare 
the squarish champion switch combines a conventional 12volt main 
battery and a reserve into a package that fits in about 70 percent 
of the cars on the road gnb said 
if the main battery dies because the lights were left on the 
driver can flip a switch on it and start the car off the reserve 
the reserve is good for 20 engine starts just in case the engine 
keeps conking out and both main battery and reserve can be 
recharged 
the champion switch does well in subzero weather especially 
with the reserve switched on although that is not its main feature 
said thomas hatterschide a gnb vice president for engineering 
the suggested retail price is 10999 roughly twice the price of 
conventional batteries although some retailer discounting is likely 
the battery goes on sale in southeastern states around oct 1 and 
elsewhere in the country in 1990 as the factory in columbus ga 
gears up production it has been on sale in australia since november 
backup batteries have not been popular because there was no room 
for them under the hood gnbs pulsar design makes it possible to 
create battery slices by regrouping the positive and negative 
plates the slice has the same voltage as a regular battery but less 
current 
gnb is based in st paul minn and is a subsidiary of pacific 
dunlop ltd of melbourne australia it is not connected with 
champion spark plug co although it has rights to use the champion

bell atlantic and one of its unions agreed on 
major issues of a new contract that could end a 13day strike by 
next week and pacific telesis today reported substantial progress 
towards settling its own employee walkout union and company 
officials said 
a tentative agreement was worked out between bell atlantic and 
the communications workers of america on thursday after more than 
two months of bargaining and a strike that slowed services to bell 
atlantic customers in the midatlantic states 
regional issues were resolved while leaving local issues to be 
worked out in further talks 
bell atlantic subsidiaries were to resume talks today with the 
cwa on the local issues bargaining also was to continue with the 
international brotherhood of electrical workers 
both unions also are striking another regional bell company 
nynex which serves the northeast cwa alone is striking two other 
regional bells ameritech which serves five midwestern states and 
pacific telesis which serves california and nevada 
pacific bell spokesman lou saviano said cwa and pacific 
negotiators made very substantial progress yesterday and the day 
before but there still were unresolved issues talks continued 
today 
no contract talks were scheduled at nynex or ameritech 
in washington cwa spokesman bill bickers said the bell atlantic 
agreement will have no direct effect on the other strikes but 
hopefully this will give some impetus to those units to reach an 
agreement 
union officials said the cwa workers will not return to work at 
bell atlantic until all local issues are resolved and the ibew 
reaches agreement with the company but both sides said a final 
accord could be reached within days 
the major strike issues of wages and health benefits have been 
resolved bickers said at a news conference this does not mean 
that the strike is over but the way has been paved to resolve local 
issues we are prepared to negotiate around the clock over the next 
several days to settle the outstanding issues 
company spokesman christopher clouser called the agreement very 
fair and one that balances the needs of employees customers and 
shareowners 
were very confident and hopeful that its both in our interest 
and the unions to have people back to work next week clouser 
said 
the local issues include disputes over jobtitle and workrule 
changes at each of bell atlantics subsidiaries in pennsylvania new 
jersey maryland delaware virginia west virginia and the district 
of columbia 
wages and employee contributions to healthinsurance plans have 
been major issues blocking settlement of the contracts with the four 
companies nearly 200000 employees in 20 states and the district of 
columbia 
the striking workers include operators telephone installers and 
repairmen factory workers and some sales and clerical personnel 
all four companies have continued service using management 
personnel but there have been delays for customers seeking some 
installation and operator services 
the tentative cwabell atlantic agreement calls for an immediate 
3 percent pay raise for the 41000 cwa workers they would receive 
raises of 2 percent in both the second and final years of the 
contract the cwa workers also would receive a costofliving 
adjustment in the latter two years of the contract and a 
profitsharing payment in all three years 
outside the headquarters of bell telephone co of pennsylvania in 
philadelphia picket mary angela kane said seven and a half 
percent is not much but its better than nothing itll feed my two 
kids 
the union agreed to a managed care plan designed to provide 
improved benefits and prevent significant increases for 
outofpocket health care expenses if union workers use health 
care providers recommended by bell atlantic 
bell atlantic has subsidiaries serving 127 million customers it 
has 52000 workers on strike including about 11000 ibew workers 
in other developments thursday 
striking workers carried signs reading nynex murderers at a 
memorial rally for a fellow striker who died tuesday after falling 
off the hood of a car of a nonstriking worker the day before at 
the rally outside nynex headquarters in white plains ny cwa 
official jan pierce said the union was calling for a complete and 
independent investigation into the death of edward g horgan 
new york state police investigated reports that vandals cut 
cables belonging to the strikeplagued new york telephone co 
interrupting telephone service for as many as 5000 customers some 
service had been restored by midday 
indiana bell officials sent striking workers a letter outlining 
a contract proposal union negotiators rejected the company said it 
had offered a 5 percent raise in the first year including a 
onetime bonus and 225 percent and 25 percent increases in the 
next two years plus increases in health benefits profitsharing

wheat and corn futures prices dipped friday on 
confirmation of large foreign purchases of those grains while 
soybean futures closed higher following a private forecast for a 
surprisingly small crop 
the decline in the wheat and corn markets was a perfect example 
of buy the rumor sell the fact said william biedermann director 
of research for allendale inc a futures brokerage in crystal lake 
ill 
the agriculture department said mexico purchased more than 
400000 metric tons of us corn thursday and china bought 150000 
metric tons of corn and 100000 metric tons of wheat the first us 
grain purchases by china in two years 
biedermann said the foreign sales had been expected since aug 9 
when several grain exporters bought large quantities of futures 
contracts apparently to hedge purchases on the cash market of grain 
they planned to sell overseas 
soybean prices were buoyed by active cash markets for soybean 
meal and oil and by crop estimates from memphis tennbased sparks 
commodities inc a private analytical firm that were lower than 
the government projections issued last week 
sparks pegged the us soybean crop at 184 billion bushels 
compared to the usdas estimate of 191 billion and sparks pegged 
the corn crop at 705 billion bushels compared to the usdas 
projected 735 billion 
at the close wheat was 2 cents to 5 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in september at 392 a bushel corn was 1 
cents lower to 1 cents higher with september at 235 a bushel 
oats were unchanged to 1 cent higher with september at 138 a

a group of leonardo da vinci drawings renamed 
after occidental petroleum corp chairman armand hammer and 
represented as part of his foundations art collection were 
actually bought for 5 million by the oil company documents in a 
shareholders lawsuit show 
books and brochures published by the armand hammer foundation 
maintained it had purchased the sketches renamed the codex 
hammer 
however depositions unsealed thursday in delaware chancery court 
at the request of the los angeles times and the wall street journal 
show the 1980 purchase was paid for by occidental petroleum the 
times described extensive donations of occidental funds to hammer 
charities in the last 10 years 
hammer 91 declined requests for comment 
the industrialist has an art collection valued at more than 250 
million he has given huge sums to charity among other things 
funding anticancer research and helping victims of the chernobyl 
nuclear disaster in the soviet union and the war in afghanistan 
but the shareholders say in their lawsuit against hammer 
occidental and its board of directors that ostensibly charitable 
gifts by occidental petroleum are actually designed to glorify 
hammer and are a waste of corporate funds 
the suit seeks to block occidentals commitment of 55 million to 
160 million to build and endow the armand hammer museum of art and 
cultural center in los angeles 
hammers attorneys contend the directors have acted legally and 
in accord with their duty to the corporation in making donations 
that promote good will toward occidental while benefiting society 
the court records show that from 1982 to this year occidental 
petroleum after votes of its board of directors gave nearly 33 
million to four organizations associated with hammer two of which 
bear his name 
i think it clearly is within the discretion of the board of 
directors to make those donations said bruce kauffman the 
philadelphia attorney representing hammer in the case 
it is good for the corporation to be associated with museums 
stopping cancer world peace kauffman said in a telephone 
interview 
hammer did not return a phone call seeking comment friday 
kauffman had no direct answer to why hammer had represented the 
purchase of da vinci sketches as being his foundations instead of 
the companys 
im not sufficiently familiar with the details to comment on 
that kauffman said 
but he said i dont know of any time that dr hammer has tried 
to make it look as though he alone was the source of the foundation 
money although he said hammer has donated 45 million of his own 
money to the foundation over the years 
hammer announced plans for the art museum bearing his name in 
1988 after he withdrew a commitment to give his collection to the 
los angeles county museum of art 
the court records show hammer withdrew his pledge after 
administrators at the county museum balked at his demands to strip 
galleries of the names of previous donors and devote an entire 
museum wing to hammers art he insisted that no other work could be 
displayed with the hammer collection 
the museum was treating me not as a donor but as somebody that 
frankly they could push around hammer recalled in a deposition 
and i wasnt going to be pushed around 
the records also show that occidental not hammer or his 
foundation gave a 2 million gift to the county museum of art in 
1980 to build a bridge connecting two wings of the museum and an 
escalator 
in a 1980 press release issued by the armand hammer foundation 
and in a deposition hammer gave in los angeles in june hammer 
maintained he had financed the gift himself or through the 
foundation 
but hammer in a deposition taken under oath acknowledged that 
was not so after an attorney for dissident shareholder alan kahn 
showed hammer records indicating that the money was occidentals 
a securities and exchange commission filing obtained separately 
indicates that in the event of hammers death occidental petroleum 
is obligated to continue paying hammers salary to the foundation 
until february 1998 the times said 
hammer is paid about 2 million yearly in salary and stock 
options but kauffman said about 95 percent of that is given to 
charity 
occidental petroleum records show that it donated 328 million 
in a sevenyear period ending earlier this year to four charities 
associated with hammer of those 59 million went directly to the 
armand hammer foundation another 20 million was given to the 
armand hammer united world college in new mexico 
in 1985 occidental made 163 million in charitable donations 
133 million of it to hammerassociated organizations that total 
represented 633 percent of the total money paid out as dividends to 
occidental shareholders 
kauffman said those donations were an effective form of public 
relations for occidental which does not sell anything directly to 
the public and thus has a harder time than many corporations in 
promoting itself 
theyre helping promote the company as well as helping 
society he said

along with the reaction of the bond market 
although some bluechip issues showed strong gains the market 
remained generally trendless with the broader market lagging behind

had two new potential bidders mcgraw hill stock also gained 
strongly as speculation resurfaced that paramount communications

ual corps stock price continued gaining altitude 
friday as speculators bet that suitors which reportedly now include 
texas investor robert bass and a team of british airways plc and 
morgan stanley amp co would engage in a bidding war 
ual rose 462 a share at 271 late friday on the new york stock 
exchange that followed a gain of 1462 on thursday and more than 
90 a share overall since a buyout proposal by california investor 
marvin davis was disclosed some two weeks ago 
my guess is that the interest ranges from very serious on the 
part of some firms to others who are just exploring the feasibility 
of getting involved said robert decker airline analyst for duff 
amp phelps 
other than davis bid there isnt enough information out there 
to make an educated guess but its my sense that were approaching 
the upper limits of what anybody is going to pay for the company 
he said 
davis on wednesday sweetened his proposal to 619 billion or 
275 a share from the initial 54 billion or 240 a share and has 
indicated he might be willing to go even higher after reviewing 
internal company data 
uals directors met thursday and later stated it was premature to 
decide whether the company would be sold 
ual confirmed it had been contacted by other potential bidders 
and had held discussions with an employee group but declined to 
identify any of the parties 
in addition to bass and british airwaysmorgan stanley pan am 
corp has stated it was interested in a possible merger with ual 
the parent of united airlines 
also said to be eyeing ual are the united unit of the air line 
pilots association which represents uniteds 7125 pilots and 
offered unsuccessfully to buy the company in 1987 and chairman 
stephen wolf who reportedl is exploring a bid by current ual 
management possibly in conjunction with the pilots 
all of the groups declined to comment friday citing policies 
regarding speculative reports 
united spokeswoman sara dornacker said the company would not 
expand on its comments made after the board meeting thursday 
although she said the directors next regularly scheduled meeting 
was sept 27 
in a statement issued early friday davis said he and his 
associates were awaiting with interest the boards conclusions and 
continue to look forward to working with uals board management and 
labor groups to develop a transaction that works to the benefit of 
all parties concerned 
my guess is that theyre buying time to continue with their own 
analysis of what ual is worth said decker once they get that 
completed theyll be in better position to decide who they talk 
with and about how much 
decker also said the pilots union likely was being courted or 
would be by any group with serious designs on acquiring ual 
its improbable any deal could be done without some form of 
cooperation from the pilots and probably the machinists as well 
he said it may not come down to a share of ownership though 
thats possible but any acquirer would have a hard time getting 
financing without some promise of cooperation 
that gives lenders comfort that they wont be facing a 
strike he said

unsafe landings occurred on two eastern airlines 
flights recently because of inexperienced pilots hired to replace 
strikers the air line pilots association contended friday but both 
eastern and the federal agency responsible for air safety disputed 
the claims 
the union representing pilots at most major us airlines said 
the incidents involved hard landings at airports in atlanta and 
chicago the airplanes were damaged in both cases but there were no 
injuries the pilots union said 
a spokesman for the federal aviation administration said the 
chicago incident in which a tail cone fell off didnt involve a 
hard landing but was due to a mechanical malfunction 
in the atlanta case eastern performed the required inspection 
after the hard landing replaced the affected parts and put the 
plane back into service said the spokesman fred farrar 
these are not inexperienced pilots farrar said from 
washington 
he said the faas information on the incidents was based on 
reports made by eastern 
eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak in miami confirmed that the 
incidents occurred but said they were not caused by the pilots 
being unseasoned the chicago incident resulted from a mechanical 
problem and was not a hard landing while the hard landing in 
atlanta apparently was due to weather conditions or the jet being 
overweight she said 
inexperienced pilots were not a factor ms ceremsak said 
this is another example of the pilots attempting to string 
unrelated incidents together to further their cause 
the pilots association made the charges in a statement released 
from washington where its executive council is considering calling 
for a nationwide suspension of service on virtually all domestic 
carriers to show support for easterns strikers 
the pilots union struck eastern on march 4 in sympathy with a 
walkout by the machinists union but veteran pilots by the dozens 
crossed picket lines last week and eastern last friday said it had 
stopped hiring new pilots or taking strikers back 
of the four pilots involved in the two incidents three were 
hired by eastern since the strike and one had little experience in 
the type of aircraft he was flying at the time the pilots union 
said 
while hard landings are not unheard of in everyday airline 
operations it is unusual to find two of them involving newhire 
pilots in such a short period of time at the same airline the 
statement read these incidents illustrate the ongoing problems 
that eastern has had because of its inexperienced pilot group 
the pilots union said its information was obtained from 
observation posts and by monitoring radio frequencies at major 
airports where eastern operates 
in the first incident on july 29 in chicago a mcdonnelldouglas 
dc9 aircraft lost its tail cone because of the impact of a hard 
landing according to the pilots union the inflatable evacuation 
slide also was jarred loose and trailed the plane on the ground as 
it taxied to the gate it said 
but farrar and ms ceremsak said the tail cone came off because a 
lever attached to it released accidentally there is no evidence 
of a hard landing farrar said referring to the dc9 episode 
the first officer who was flying the approach was a new hire 
the pilots union said it said the captain was an eastern veteran 
but he had spent most of his time at the carrier as an instructor or 
in the position of second officer a nonflying post 
in the atlanta incident on aug 12 a lockheed l1011 jumbo jet 
bounced on the runway during a landing attempt the pilots union 
said the pilots aborted the landing performed a go around for 
another approach and successfully completed the second attempt the 
union said 
the captain and the first officer were both new hires the 
statement said 
the pilots union said the damaged aircraft was still in a hangar 
farrar and ms ceremsak disputed that claim saying the l1011 
sustained no damage and was put back in service after some of the 
seals on its landing gear were replaced

bond prices finished mixed friday as buying by 
bargainhunters offset the early prices declines that followed the 
latest consumer inflation report 
prices of longterm treasury and corporate bonds edged up but 
prices of shorterterm treasury issues and taxexempt bonds slipped 
the price of the treasurys benchmark 30year bond rose 116 
point or less than 1 for every 1000 in face value as its yield 
dipped to 815 percent from 816 percent late thursday 
prices fell after the labor department reported that its consumer 
price index rose 02 percent in july while that increase was widely 
expected some traders were disappointed by a 04 percent rise in 
prices other than for food and energy that increase was up from a 
03 percent increase in june 
kevin flanagan money market economist for dean witter reynolds 
inc said that while the report was nothing alarming the market 
was being skittish 
he said any indication that inflation is accelerating encourages 
speculation that the federal reserve will not soon relax its credit 
policy 
he said there were also concerns that brokerage houses that 
bought treasury issues auctioned last week were still trying to find 
buyers for the securities 
but flanagan said prices moved higher later in the day 
recovering most of the days lost ground as buyers emerged at the 
higher yields 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
issues lost point intermediate securities fell 332 point and 
longterm issues rose as much as 332 point according to figures 
provided by telerate inc a financial information service 
the movement of a point equals a change of 10 in the price of a 
bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer fell 072 to 117736 
corporate bonds prices edged up moodys investment grade 
corporate bond index which measures total return on a portfolio of 
80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer rose 
022 to 32825 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds fell point the average yield to maturity 
rose to 732 percent from 731 percent late thursday 
yields on threemonth treasury bills fell to 809 percent as the 
discount dropped 5 basis points to 783 percent yields on sixmonth 
bills rose to 828 percent as the discount rose 1 basis point to

profittaking put an end to a sevenday runup in copper futures 
prices friday on new yorks commodity exchange but chartwatchers 
said technical signals pointed toward further gains 
this might actually help analyst stephen platt of dean 
witter reynolds inc said of the moderately steep decline he said 
the market had fallen back to prices it had skipped over on its way 
up and cited a theory that markets must fill such gaps before 
resuming a trend 
on other futures markets friday precious metals retreated while 
futures prices for energy grains soybeans livestock and meat were 
mixed 
copper settled 150 cents to 235 cents lower with the contract 
for spot delivery at 12465 a pound and the more actively traded 
september contract at 12390 
spot prices had climbed as high as 12680 on thursday which 
represented a gain of more than 15 percent since aug 8 
the rally had been linked to indications that production 
problems including ongoing miner strikes in canada and peru were 
beginning to make a dent in copper stockpiles 
analysts said fridays decline was largely a due to preweekend 
profittaking after the nearly vertical runup 
platt said prospects for a settlement of the 5dayold peruvian 
strike appeared to be improving he said the miners must return to 
work to qualify for wage bonuses and some observers believe those 
bonuses are enough incentive to bring the strike to an end 
but both platt and peter cardillo commodities trading adviser 
with josephthal amp co said the market continued to look strong from 
a technical perspective 
gold and silver futures prices fell slightly on the comex in 
response to the labor departments report of a modest 02 percent 
rise in consumer prices last month 
low inflation rates or falling prices tend to discourage investor 
buying of precious metals

troy ounce silver was 08 cent to 1 cent lower with september at 
5255 a troy ounce

foreign purchases of those grains while soybean futures closed 
higher following a private forecast for a surprisingly small crop 
memphisbased sparks commodities inc pegged the us soybean crop

estimate last week of 191 billion and sparks pegged the corn crop 
at 705 billion bushels compared to the usdas projected 735 
billion

credit card use is booming in 
brazil because of hyperinflation which makes it worthwhile for 
shoppers to buy now and pay later 
consumers are using plastic to pay for everything from newspapers 
and samba dance classes to ritual voodoo costumes as a way to beat 
the merrygoround of price hikes 
because theres no finance charge if bills are paid promptly at 
the end of the month shopping by credit card in effect can lock in 
prices that prevailed at the time purchases were made 
a year ago 36 million credit cards were circulating in the 
country of 145 million people industry figures show today there 
are 62 million and card marketing directors predict the number 
will quintuple by 1993 
youre looking at the hottest market in the services sector in 
brazil today said paulo veras bica director of banco nacionals 
visa card 
foreign card companies are scrambling to exploit the demand 
foreseeing a continuous growth in the buying power of brazilian 
consumers despite the countrys staggering economic problems 
mastercard which in brazil is associated with credicard 
brazils most popular card with 22 million users has more than 
doubled its number of cardholders in the last two years 
american express card membership rose to 480000 in june a 30 
percent increase since 1987 diners club saw its clientele triple in 
two years to 300000 in july 
visa associated with two of brazils largest commercial banks 
banco do brasil and banco nacional and gained nearly 1 million 
clients since last year 
we were just another card that belonged to a bank and we were 
fading into the sunset associating ourselves with visa gave us 
prestige validity and credibility said bica banco nacionals 
credit director 
in return visa is benefiting from an influx of foreign tourists 
who find more brazilian merchants willing to accept cards the 
company looks forward to the day when the government allows 
brazilians to use cards abroad a practice now prohibited as a way 
of protecting brazils foreign currency reserves 
visa is gambling that soon brazilians will be able to use their 
cards when they travel said ruben osta finance director for 
banco nacionals visa card they want to be here first when the 
government gives the goahead 
brazilians are not yet as addicted to plastic money as american 
cardholders who pack an average of eight cards but that too is 
changing rapidly 
brazilians are going through a change in culture said marcio 
souza director for the bradesco banks credit card the no 2 card 
in brazil with 185 million clients 
these days credit cards are more than a buying tool or a means 
of getting a loan theyre becoming a business and social 
credential 
a shift in banking practices underlies the trend checks the 
predominant form of payment during the last decade are 
relinquishing ground to automated credit transactions because banks 
are reducing paperwork and costs 
security convenience and incentives such as 24hour 
computerized tellers and instant access to bank accounts also are 
winning new members 
brazil is entering the modern age of banking and consuming 
said jean rozwadowski who heads the brazilian operations of 
american express 
there is a tremendous upsurge in card usage says osta of 
banco nacional 
unprecedented marketing drives are spreading plastic to faroff 
rural regions 
its not easy convincing shop owners in jungle or mining towns 
why they should accept a card instead of cash or gold says sergio 
machado credit card director at banco do brasil a 
governmentcontrolled commercial bank south americas largest 
but were doing it 
machado said more than 75 percent of brazilian cities with 
populations under 500000 now accept the banco do brasilvisa card 
called ourocard or gold card 
not even a dip in workers buying clout and a deep economic 
decline last year daunt the expectations of card companies 
the underground economy makes up at least 40 percent of the 
total economy said bica and as it grows people will have more 
and more disposable income on the side to spend 
nonetheless there is concern that the countrys relentless 
inflation rate could boomerang on the creditcard issuers in july 
alone the cost of living rose 2876 percent and august inflation is 
expected to be even higher computed over the last 12 months annual 
inflation averages 1000 percent 
some merchants have taken matters into their own hands by 
boycotting credit cards because of delayed reimbursement by card 
issuers others have begun charging card customers 45 percent more 
than cashpaying clients a practice that is illegal but growing 
credit cards are supposed to be cash payment complained 
denise neueschwander 34 a rio housewife but no one seems to 
know that here 
some critics warn that turning brazil into a credit card society 
could fuel inflation even more and eventually compel the government 
to take drastic measures to curb their use which could help incite 
a recession 
but marketing directors dismiss the notion 
its a fantastic future market said marcos vinicius araujo 
spokesman for credicard were not worried

free toasters are history todays banks 
offer thrills excitement and chance to prospective depositors 
support your favorite baseball team take a chance on the 
weather help an environmental cause these are among the gimmicks 
banks are using to lure new accounts 
fleet national bank based in providence has offered 
certificates of deposit that encourage customers to put your money 
where your mouth is by investing in a cd with an interest rate 
that increases each time either the red sox or yankees win 
a new hampshire bank offers a cd with an interest rate that 
varies with the daily temerature 
from a competitors point of view its easier just to hike a 
rate said tom howe fleets senior vice president in products and 
services 
but the more creative type of deposit strategy one that 
generates more enthusiasm and interest helps broadens the market 
by targeting unconventional cd depositors he said 
the method appears to work fleet has offered sports cds since 
1986 when the boston celtics were seeking their 16th nba 
championship 
weve been quite pleased with the results said howe 
the trick was to guess the number of points the celtics would 
score in the final game those who guessed correctly saw their cd 
jump to 16 percent from 7 percent for the full threemonth term 
when providence college took on the university of rhode island at 
basketball in 1987 the bank capitalized on a longstanding feud by 
offering a cd with an interest rate that increased onetwentieth of 
1 percent for every game the customers chosen team won 
fleet continued the sports tradition with a home team cd 
offered last fall in which the interest rate rose each time the 
boston bruins or boston celtics won a home game 
this year fleet reoffered a baseball cd geared to the yankeesred 
sox rivalry only available before the teams met for the first time 
june 8 the cd increases onetenth of 1 percent from then on each 
time the customers chosen team wins 
if the chosen team wins the american league championship the cd 
would receive a 1 percent bonus on the total deposit 
the rhode island state police responsible for enforcing the 
states antigambling laws say they have investigated the sports 
cds and determined they are legal 
you are really not gambling said sgt terrance burgess of 
internal affairs they are gong to give out a flat cd rate anyway 
so the element of chance if its there is almost nonexistent you 
cant lose 
the baseball cd required a 1000 minimum deposit and offered a 
fixed rate of 9 percent for a sixmonth deposit 
howe would not say how many sports cds have been taken out 
i think the fact that the bank has offered multiple sports cds 
suggests that they are well recieved by the rhode island public 
he said 
rhode islanders arent the only ones who have welcomed the 
innovation lincoln savings bank in new york for example offered a 
similar cd based on the yankees and mets 
new hampshires cheshire county savings bank offered a heat 
wave cd so unusual it took more than a month to catch on 
the interest rate on the threemonth cd is 10 percent of whatever 
the days high is in concord nh after october the rates will be 
based on the temperature in orlando fla 
if the temperature is a record high for the day the cd would 
increase a half a percent more said elizabeth colby a customer 
service representative at cheshire the rate is guaranteed not to 
drop below 75 percent and has peaked at 975 percent since it began 
july 11 
it took a little while for people to see what its all about 
she said its picking up 
the cd which requires a 500 minimum deposit appeals to young 
people partly because of the low investment and also because of the 
unusual terms she said 
older people are more apt to want a fixed interest rate said 
colby younger people tend to gamble a little more 
fleet targeted another market with a cd it offered in the 
aftermath of an oil spill off the coast of newport ri earlier 
this summer agreeing to donate to save the bay 1 per 1000 
deposited up to a maximum of 50000 
the oil spill in the bay obviously increased the awareness of 
most rhode islanders to the environment said howe so we felt 
the timing of this product was really good

an outofcourt settlement has been approved by a 
federal court judge giving 24 million to former shareholders of 
provincetown boston airlines which declared bankruptcy in 1985 
once the nations largest commuter carrier pba is now operated 
by continental airlines 
a classaction suit was filed against the airline by shareholders 
citing pbas failure to disclose a longstanding investigation of 
the airline by the federal aviation administration 
according to federal securities laws an investor must be given 
all of the necessary information to make an intelligent decision and 
this obviously was not the case here said jeffrey herrmann a 
saddle brook nj attorney who represented the shareholders in the 
4yearold suit 
im delighted that the shareholders received a return on their 
investment and in most cases a complete recovery of the damages 
they suffered as a result of the defendants action herrmann said 
pba ran into troubles during a rapid expansion in the mid1980s 
most notably two fatal air crashes in boston harbor and florida 
us district court judge charles e stewart jr approved the 
settlement

effort to stimulate competition and reduce costs 
since then pratt amp whitney a division of united technologies 
corp of hartford conn has been a second source of the engines
