the symbol of the anticommunist 
revolution president vaclav havel has built enormous power and 
popularity since taking office much of the public following is 
genuine veneration but critics say a cult of personality is 
growing that havel does too little to control 
after his fairytale progression from prison to the presidency 
last year havel has become a national father figure particularly 
for his fellow czechs who make up twothirds of the 155 million 
people in czechoslovakia 
now he has led his civic forum to victory in the countrys first 
free elections in more than four decades 
in prague a stronghold of the civic forum movement havel 
founded to lead the revolution pictures and buttons of the 
president are everywhere 
havel himself complained in late april that his popularity had 
reached such extremes that he could no longer say for instance 
that he disliked a passing dog if he did he said he would find 
five people ready to shoot the animal 
but some critics who have observed havel closely before and 
after he took office say the president has developed a tangible 
taste for power and does too little to discourage such veneration 
we have a new cult of personality said an exdissident who 
asked not to be identified because of past loyalty to havel he 
has always relied on friendly opinions around him there is too 
little criticism 
after taking office havel appointed friends mostly fellow 
dissidents to influential positions at the castle that dominates 
pragues skyline 
fellow dissident jiri kanturek took over state television and 
another fellow dissident petr uhl the state news agency ctk 
civic forum sympathizers control key ministries and institutions 
such as the state prosecutors office 
nobody suggests that such people are anything but democratic and 
admirable for their courage in fighting communism 
on sunday however tv viewers waiting to watch their world cup 
soccer team crush the united states 51 were treated to the third 
broadcast in four months of the starstudded tribute to havel when 
he visited new york 
czechoslovakias soccer captain ivan hasek dedicated the world 
cup victory to civic forum and to havel personally 
such reverence and the czechoslovak medias reluctance to 
criticize havel stem in part from the lack of free expression 
during four decades of communist rule and the nazi domination 
before that 
journalists say they also think twice about writing critical 
articles because in the new climate of free market competition 
newspapers must worry about the readership loss that might result 
vladimir mlynar a writer for the lidove noviny independent 
daily said an article he wrote criticizing the practice of closing 
streets for havels motorcade drew mixed letters 
some said thank god someobody is saying it he said 
others criticized asking how dare you attack our idol 
the overwhelming victory for civic forum and its slovak ally 
public against violence was in large measure a personal endorsement 
of havel but havel broke the tradition of a nonpartisan president 
by openly campaigning for his political allies 
in other respects havel openly evokes the president who molded 
that nonpartisan tradition thomas garrigue masaryk founder of 
czechoslovakia in 1918 and president until 1935 
presidential spokesman michael zantovsky asked about havels 
popularity said it was to some extent inevitable 
this is a newfound nation which looks for 
selfconfidence he said just as something close to a cult of 
personality was built around masaryk after independence in 1918 so 
we see the same kind of thing happening 
but havel also cultivates the comparison 
he loves to frequent the country residence built for masaryk in 
lany 30 miles west of prague the town where the masaryk family is 
buried havel addresses the nation each sunday by radio in a 
program called conversations from lany 
a czech television journalist who has watched havel closely said 
the president has yet to succumb to the cult of personality 
by contrast he said those around the president tend to be too 
uncritical 
if he keeps on relying on friendly advice rather than real 
expertise he may pay dearly for this said the journalist who 
like some others spoke on condition of anonymity because he said he 
feared for his job 
zantovsky said the press shouldnt be so cautious we need 
people who are willing to go public and criticize whatever aspect 
of havels activities they dont like he said 
while willing to accept criticism havel is not above using his 
power and influence 
he now says for example that he will run for reelection only 
if he can appoint a government serving the national interest 
given his enormous popularity at home and abroad the threat of 
not running exerts powerful pressure for a government molded to 
please havel the young democracy identified with havel would 
suffer from the political turmoil and lack of foreign aid that 
might result from his resignation

when eskimo whaling crews on the arctic 
ocean want to determine the weather they scan the sky study the 
ice test the wind and observe the currents then they might turn 
on the radio for the whaling forecast 
the national weather service this spring bought a vhf radio 
transmitter to broadcast forecasts at least three times daily for 
whalers out on the ice near barrow 
its additional safety its made quite a difference said 
eugene brower president of the barrow whaling captains 
association the old and the new work together its just more 
refined 
until this spring the weather service had sent its whaling 
forecasts on citizens band radio which whalers complained 
frequently was interrupted or fuzzy vhf signals usually used for 
shipping and aviation offer much better reception and range 
the whaling captains met last year with the services barrow 
station manager chuck evans and offered to buy a vhf transmitter 
for direct communications with crews on the ice 
the weather service liked the idea enough that it decided to pay 
for the radio evans said the radio can transmit as far as 50 
miles from barrow 
floating ice strong currents high winds and fog are the main 
dangers to whalers 
if the wind blows the ice wrong it could trap the boats and 
crush them evans said if we see anything thats unusual or 
could be a hazard to them then we broadcast more frequently 
the whalers keep the radios at their camps on the ice brower 
said and find the extended forecasts predicting weather for the 
next few days most helpful 
its insurance they havent been wrong he said before 
we used to have some doubts but this spring theyve been right on 
the money rain snow how strong the wind is ice conditions 
eskimo whalers still use ancient forecasting methods as well he 
said things that we have observed over time 
some of the oldtimers would look at the sun the moon and let 
us know whats happening said brower weve never learned the 
full knowledge they had 
the eskimo spring whaling season usually starts in midapril and 
runs through may as the whales head for their summer feeding 
grounds 
the fall season begins in august when the bowheads migrate 
south past the arctic slope and through the bering strait 
although commercial whaling is banned eskimos are allowed to 
hunt a limited number of whales for their own use the 
international whaling commission sets annual quotas this years 
quota for the seven eskimo spring whaling villages is 44 bowhead 
whales 12 of those for barrow 
more than half that total has been reached 
no eskimos have died while whaling in recent years brower said 
but some crews lost their camps and equipment in 1988 when the ice 
broke up 
we have a lot of respect for the moving ice out there he 
said 
eventually the weather service hopes whalers will give 
forecasters a better grasp of arctic weather evans said 
they listen to what weve got compare it with what they know 
and they go with it said evans 
we can tell them all kinds of information and thats not going 
to change their minds its the knowledge they have of the ice that 
matters

prime minister yitzhak shamir has pledged to 
make peace a top priority of his new rightwing government but he 
faces a major task in convincing arab enemies he is not a monster 
seeking war 
in an apparent effort to allay washingtons fears shamir and 
leading political allies have softened rhetoric about 
settlementbuilding that us policy considers an obstacle to peace 
officials of shamirs rightwing likud bloc suggest their new 
government which won parliamentary approval on monday will move 
quickly to improve ties with the bush administration 
they acknowledge that israels new government has an image 
problem 
yossi olmert director of the government press office said 
we are concerned we are aware of it and we shall strive to 
explain what the government is all about 
there is more flexibility in this government than meets the 
eye he added 
david levy the new foreign minister was housing minister in 
the last government and approved granting 18 million in state 
funds to start a new settlement during easter week in the christian 
quarter of jerusalems old city 
but he told reporters his first task as foreign minister would 
be to prevent deterioration and to improve israels strained 
ties with the united states 
harry wall israel director of the antidefamation league of 
bnai brith said the government would act to reassure concerned 
us jews that it is not extremist 
it will have to try harder to disabuse the critics who think 
that this regime will not push the peace processthe important 
thing will be to watch what it does and not what is said 
palestinians however plainly do not believe a rightwing 
government will make any sincere move toward starting negotiations 
they see shamir as a politician who opposed the peace treaty 
with egypt levy as the man whose reign as housing minister 
resulted in creation of most of the 130 existing settlements in the 
occupied territories and ariel sharon the new immigration czar as 
the man who launched a war against palestinians in lebanon 
in a leaflet the underground leadership of the 30month 
palestinian uprising noted that shamirs government relied for 
support on the twoseat moledet or homeland party which advocates 
the expulsion of all arabs 
it called for an escalation of antiisraeli protests to burn 
the ground under the feet of the occupations army and settlers 
faisal husseini a leading palestinian activist in jerusalem 
said i think it is a government of war and i think the 
decisions of such a government will be a decision of war 
elias freij the moderate mayor of the west bank town of 
bethlehem predicted a new wave of settlement building saying 
israeli bulldozers are much more dangerous than armored tanks 
others predicted a new wave of arrests aimed at leading 
activists and the possible closing of arabiclanguage newspapers 
which rightwingers have accused of inciting antiisrael violence 
the daily alquds newspaper which reflects proplo views said 
shamirs peacemaking efforts would not be credible because likud 
and other rightwing parties opposed yielding any warwon land 
how can shamirs government program talk about peace while on 
the other hand rejecting the principle of land for peacewhat 
kind of peace is shamir talking about 
the new government guidelines in addition to advocating new 
settlements in the occupied west bank and gaza strip appear to 
kill any chances that israel will now adopt secretary of state 
james a baker iiis proposals for a palestinianisraeli dialogue 
in cairo 
for example they rule out any participation of palestinians 
from israeliannexed east jerusalem from participating in elections 
proposed for the occupied territories which israel seized in the 
1967 middle east war 
shamir speaking to likud bloc members sunday said that the 
instigators among our enemies want to present us as a monster 
seeking war we shall not respond to them in their language we 
shall talk peace to all the world 
in his address to parliament on monday shamir hinted that he 
would seek a new process that focuses on egypt taking a more active 
role and on reviving the camp david plan for establishing limited 
autonomy for palestinians in occupied areas 
the time has come for egypt to stop maneuvering between an 
inclination for peace and the arab elements devoted to 
uncompromising hatred shamir said 
political scientist gabi sheffer director of the leonard davis 
institute at hebrew university said there was little hope for a 
serious peace effort because the right wing wants to annex the west 
bank rather than use it as a bargaining chip 
a new initiative will be sought but i have difficulties in 
seeing how it can be a serious one the situation has reached a 
stage where israel must talk with the palestinians but i cant see 
this government doing it he said

when it comes to worms wayne fauser 
is all business even at the dinner table 
he stocks more than 10 million worms on his three adelaidebased 
farms for his company fauser all states worms pty ltd which has 
grown into one of the largest worm farms in the country since its 
1985 inception 
and at the risk of eating into his profits fauser also consumes 
worms in great quantity in sandwiches omelettes and just about 
any food that can contain meat 
theyre a great source of protein and they taste great he 
said monday as he snacked on an overflowing worm sandwich 
the worms must be fed a diet of dough for 48 hours before being 
cooked 
then theyre all right for all sorts of dishes fauser said 
im sure they will eventually be on adelaide menus 
as an easy meal he suggests dice and fry an onion in a frying 
pan add live worms and two cups of minced pork or beef fry until 
cooked add a can of tomatoes chopped red pepper salt and 
seasoning just before serving sprinkle with cheese the end 
result is a meal for two

of the royal opera house we have taken these steps with 
reluctance in order to sustain rather than reduce our service to 
our audiences

texas a major center for oil drilling 
refining and transportation isnt ready for the mammoth spill in 
the gulf of mexico that could come from a supertanker burning 
offshore a state official said monday 
this is our worst nightmare said land commissioner garry 
mauro who serves on the governors oil spill advisory committee 
were not ready to deal with a catastrophic oil spill off the 
coast 
but gov bill clements disagreed saying texas is hoping and 
praying that the worst doesnt happen but if it does well be 
ready 
because of the potential for a major oil spill state 
government has been put on alert the state is taking each and 
every precaution possible clements said protecting our 
environment is paramount 
by midday the tanker mega borg had spilled up to 100000 
gallons of its 38 milliongallon cargo of light crude oil the 
coast guard estimated the nearly 886footlong ships aft remained 
above water but waves occasionally washed over it slightly 
increasing the chance it could sink the coast guard said 
the norwegian ship has been on fire since an explosion saturday 
while it transferred cargo 57 miles southeast of galveston 
the response to the disaster was delayed during the weekend as 
firefighting and oil containment equipment was brought in from 
louisiana alabama and even the netherlands coast guard officials 
said 
at a news conference monday coast guard adm williams merlin 
said private salvage and containment companies responding to the 
fire had equipment stationed elsewhere because there are more 
offshore fires in the north sea and the middle east than in the 
gulf 
little of the specialized equipment exists in the world and the 
coast guard does not determine where it is assigned merlin said 
the coast guard supervises cleanups but they usually are funded by 
ship owners who hire private contractors to do the work 
this is free enterprise at work merlin said the salvage 
companies that operate in this area find more business overseas 
than they do here 
we would love to have all that equipment immediately 
available he said 
the coast guard is satisfied that the mega borgs owner 
mosvolds shipping of farsund norway is acting responsibly and 
professionally merlin said 
texas ports handle 300 million tons of cargo each year 75 
percent of it crude oil or petroleum products according to mauro 
the commissioner criticized the state for failing to have a plan 
for dealing with disasters like the mega borg fire 
there is no plan to deal with 38 million gallons of oil on the 
water he said anything that happens to deal with this crisis 
is going to be a makedo emergency plan and the chances of a major 
catastrophe occurring are much higher as a result of no plan 
however other state officials said the response has gone well 
so far 
time and good weather have been on our side said state 
emergency management coordinator robert lansford 
texas water commission chairman buck wynne said the state can 
better respond to shippng disasters thanks to a recent drill that 
simulated a 200000gallon oil spill in the gulf 
hopefully weve identified problems in coordinating a 
response to a major oil spill said wynne whose agency is part 
of a regional response team that includes the coast guard and other 
federal agencies 
i think we are as ready as we can be he said 
mauro said texas deals well with small spills but is not ready 
for a large one 
he recommends that the state consolidate oil spill emergency 
planning in one agency instead of the current five buy and deploy 
cleanup equipment along the gulf coast and get more federal 
equipment placed in texas 
clements said putting more equipment along the texas coast has 
been debated 
its terribly expensive equipment and a lot of people are 
involved he said you never seem to have the people and 
equipment where the problem arises

a supreme court decision to overturn a flag 
protection law is a political gift to republican conservatives who 
have seen some of their best themes blunted by events beyond their 
reach 
president bush waved the flag with great skill in the last 
election although the top issues for republicans in the 1980s were 
taxes and defense 
but the upheaval in central and eastern europe has taken the 
steam out of the advocates of continuing the us military buildup 
then bush opened the door to a tax increase as part of his 
budget summit with congress blurring partisan lines 
in addition the supreme courts ruling last year expanding 
states power over abortion has proven electorally difficult for 
many in the gop 
if the court had upheld the antiflagburning statute congress 
approved last year that issue too would have been pushed into the 
political background 
but monday the court cooperated in a way that will force the 
democraticcontrolled congress to decide straightup on a 
constitutional amendment to ban flag burning democrats had dodged 
an amendment last fall by passing the law protecting the flag only 
to see that political cover taken from them with this 54 ruling 
congressional republicans want to stand up and salute 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan wasted no time defining 
the upcoming vote as a test of patriotism 
i happened to be at arlington cemetery on memorial day and 
some stranger asked me why dont they bring the flag burners out 
here to see the graves he said 
ill place my money on the young men and young women who serve 
in americas armed services the rest can place their money with 
the flag burners he said 
there are those of us whove fought for that flag and regard 
it as a precious national symbol said house minority leader 
robert michel rill 
for democrats opposed to the amendment the issue is undoubtedly 
a loser they were left arguing monday that the issue shouldnt be 
made partisan and taken alone isnt enough to defeat any of their 
candidates this fall 
house and senate democratic leaders seem ready to bring the 
matter up quickly which could help minimize the political impact 
and give supporters less time to whip up passions anew 
democrats their own ranks divided on the issue attacked 
republicans for trying to take advantage 
to drag the flag through cheap politics is every bit as 
offensive as burning it said democratic national chairman ron 
brown 
but republicans made clear they were in no mood to give 
democrats a free ride 
i think its a good valuedefining issue said ed rollins 
cochairman of the house gops campaign committee if your 
opponent is for flag burning then hes got to go through a very 
sophisticated explanation of why he is 
wendy democker spokeswoman for the republican senatorial 
campaign committee rattled off her select list of democratic 
incumbents who voted against the constitutional amendment last 
year when it was rejected 
she included sens max baucus dmont claiborne pell dri 
tom harkin diowa paul simon dill and carl levin dmich 
all of whom now have strong republican challengers in this years 
elections 
howard schloss spokesman for the democratic congressional 
campaign committee said the issue wont work because every 
member is for protecting the flag honoring the flag there is no 
member of the house of representatives who is saying lets burn 
the flag 
what this means is theyre desperate for anything that comes 
along schloss said if this is the only issue for them 
theyre in trouble 
schloss said democrats who vote against the constitutional 
amendment would successfully defend their positions and then move 
on to important issues such as education the environment and the 
economy 
but the democrats wont be able to keep the lid on the political 
rhetoric 
bush who used the news media and flag issue effectively in his 
1988 campaign is already planning to beat the drum as he campaigns 
around the country for gop house and senate candidates republicans 
hope it will help them in their quest to upset enough democrats to 
take control of the senate for the first time since 1980 
when the issue was hot last year democrats said they returned 
to their home districts and found voters were less concerned about 
the flag issue than other things 
but that was when it appeared a simple statute the one thrown 
out monday might suffice 
it also wasnt an election year when a complex legal issue can 
be boiled down to usorthem simplicity as dole said monday it 
would make a good 30second spot

here are excerpts from the supreme courts 54 
decision monday that overturned the federal law banning flag 
burning 
the opinion of the court was written by justice william j 
brennan justice john paul stevens wrote the dissent 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
from the majority opinion 
the governments interest in protecting the physical 
integrity of a privately owned flag rests upon a perceived need 
to preserve the flags status as a symbol of our nation and certain 
national ideals but the mere destruction or disfigurement of a 
particular physical manifestation of the symbol without more does 
not diminish or otherwise affect the symbol itself in any way 
the governments interest cannot justify its infringement on 
first amendment rights we decline the governments invitation to 
reassess this conclusion in light of congress recent recognition 
of a purported national consensus favoring a prohibition on 
flagburning even assuming such a consensus exists any 
suggestion that the governments interest in suppressing speech 
becomes more weighty as popular opposition to that speech grows is 
foreign to the first amendment 
government may create national symbols promote them and 
encourage their respectful treatment but the flag protection act 
goes well beyond this by criminally proscribing expressive conduct 
because of its likely communicative impact 
we are aware that desecration of the flag is deeply offensive to 
many but the same might be said for example of virulent ethnic 
and religious epithets vulgar repudiations of the draft and 
scurrilous caricatures punishing desecration of the flag 
dilutes the very freedom that makes this emblem so revered and 
worth revering 
 
from the dissent 
the flag uniquely symbolizes the ideas of liberty equality and 
tolerance ideas that americans have passionately defended and 
debated throughout our history the flag embodies the spirit of our 
national commitment to those ideals 
the flag is a reminder both that the struggle for liberty 
and equality is unceasing and that our obligation of tolerance and 
respect for all of our fellow citizens encompasses those who 
disagree with us indeed even those whose ideas are disagreeable 
or offensive 
thus the government may indeed it should protect the 
symbolic value of the flag without regard to the specific content 
of the flag burners speech 
the prohibition does not entail any interference with the 
speakers freedom to express his or her ideas by other means it 
may well be true that other means of expression may be less 
effective in drawing attention to those ideas but that is not 
itself a sufficient reason for immunizing flag burning 
the freedom of expression protected by the first amendment 
embraces not only the freedom to communicate particular ideas but 
also the right to communicate them effectively that right 
however is not absolute the communicative value of a wellplaced 
bomb in the capitol does not entitle it to the protection of the 
first amendment 
the integrity of the symbol has been compromised by those 
leaders who seem to advocate compulsory worship of the flag even by 
individuals whom it offends or who seem to manipulate the symbol 
of national purpose into a pretext for partisan disputes about 
meaner ends

a change in government style is promised for 
singapore when prime minister lee kuan yew a benevolent but stern 
patriarch steps aside after 31 robust years 
plans call for first deputy prime minister goh chok tong to take 
over later this year sometime after sept 16 when lee turns 67 
goh 48 was named to the no 2 post in 1985 using a 
consultative leadership style goh says he expects to preside over 
a more open society with the goal of making singapore a great 
small nation 
lee is not passing completely from the scene however and his 
influence is expected to remain intact goh intends to have him in 
the cabinet as a senior minister without portfolio 
those who believe that when i have left the government as 
prime minister that ive gone into permanent retirement really 
should have their heads examined he once told a gathering of his 
peoples action party 
even from my sick bed even if you are going to lower me into 
the grave and i feel that something is going wrong ill get up 
the cambridgeeducated lawyer took charge in 1959 modern 
singapore began its independent existence with no resources no 
industry bitter racial divisions and potentially unfriendly 
neighbors 
lee helped forge an identity for this polyglot place uniting 
with sizeable malay and indian minorities an ethnic chinese 
majority regarded with suspicion by its moslem neighbors in 
malaysia and indonesia 
he demanded discipline to overcome hardships obedience hard 
work cleanliness thrift and the profit motive all came into play 
as a shabby british colonial outpost was transformed 
now its a flourishing banking and commercial center with 
hightech industries firstclass education and glitzy shopping 
centers 
lees government enjoys a reputation for honesty efficiency and 
a strong sense of direction standards are high and there is a 
strict moral code tipping jaywalking littering discourtesy and 
failing to flush public toilets after use are officially denounced 
those suspected of more serious transgressions such as subversion 
and drug abuse 28 convicted traffickers have been hanged can 
expect no mercy 
in recent years lees dominance over national affairs has been 
largely accepted as the justifiable means to an end that benefited 
most singaporeans 
we decide what is right never mind what the people think 
he once said more than half singapores 27 million people were 
born during lees tenure and more than 80 percent have had no other 
leader during their adult lives 
those who would challenge that leadership found themselves 
subject to arrest detention without trial public humiliation and 
general harassment by a government reluctant to acknowledge dissent 
lee said several years ago that his political heirs sometimes 
did not seem tough enough to keep the opposition and other critics 
in their place he nevertheless planned an orderly transfer of 
power to a new generation 
in 1988 he admitted publicly that he preferred education 
minister tony tan instead of the easygoing goh as his successor 
tan did not aspire to the post 
goh told the party faithful in april that he stands for 
continuity not change but he also said he expects to run a more 
open administration offering participation accommodation and 
consensus 
participation means involving as many as practicable in the 
political process goh said painting a picture of a kinder 
gentler singapore he said participation involved understanding 
their hopes and aspirations their fears and tribulations and 
helping them to realize their hopes and overcome their fears 
more than just listening to their views i also want to give 
the people more opportunity to choose and decide for themselves 
instead of letting government agencies make most of the decisions 
that often have to be applied uniformly 
goh recently visited washington london and other capitals to 
introduce himself lee has been touring separately to say farewell 
to foreign friends and offer his views on the transition 
i could not get good men to join me if theyre going to hang 
around and wait for me to go senile lee said in london ive 
got a very competent and dedicated group fully able to run the 
country and in fact have been doing so for the last four years with 
minimal overview from me 
lee has accurately described his role as that of chairman of 
singapore inc a 240squaremile citystate run on corporate 
lines ministers act as executive directors largely untroubled by 
ideological issues or domestic political infighting they are 
chosen less for their electoral appeal than their capacity to 
manage a department effectively 
lees eldest son trade and industry minister lee hsien loong 
37 is already acknowledged by goh as his logical successor as 
prime minister

agriculture department watchdogs says hundreds 
of farmers are still dodging the limits on federal subsidies some 
with intricate schemes going back several years 
a semiannual report by the departments office of inspector 
general said auditors have been reporting the abuses since 1985 
generally the payments are limited to 50000 per person 
annually but a person can be an individual a joint stock company 
a corporation an association a trust or some other legal entity 
over the fiveyear period we conducted three major audits and 
evaluated 1644 person determinations the report said we 
questioned 381 of these person determinations where these 
producers received or were scheduled to receive excessive program 
payments of 213 million 
projecting those results auditors estimated the excessive 
payments at more than 126 million 
in one case used as an example corporations a and b in 1986 
each was one person as defined by the usda program in 1987 
corporation b was dissolved and its assets absorbed by partnership 
a consisting of three persons 
corporation a partnership a and a newly created fiveperson 
partnership b were then considered as nine separate persons 
under the program 
in actual practice however each person was linked to the 
other through a shared financing arrangement and therefore should 
have been reorganized as one entity in 1987 the report said 
this arrangement continued into 1988 it added the three 
entities improperly received deficiency and disaster payments 
totaling about 577000 
program rules for additional persons were tightened in the 
omnibus reconciliation act of 1987 effective for the 1989 crop 
year however for 1989 only the law allowed for equitable farm 
reorganization 
because of this provision large operators who would have 
received reduced payments for 1989 reorganized by selling stock by 
giving stock to new individuals or others who had an interest in 
less than three entities and by creating irrevocable trusts the 
report said 
thus farm operations were reorganized to earn maximum 
payments and total program costs may not be changed from previous 
years the report added rather payments will be assigned to 
more persons created as a result of reorganization 
inspectors said they are continuing to evaluate compliance 
with the 1987 rules by expanding our audit of reorganizations of 
large farms enrolled in the usda programs 
the report covered the first half of the 1990 fiscal year 
through march 31 a wide range of usda programs and functions was 
included 
overall said deputy inspector general leon snead during the 
sixmonth period auditors identified about 24 million in 
recoveries and collections and 367 million in commitments by 
managers to put funds to better use 
our investigative efforts resulted in 224 indictments 368 
convictions and about 23 million in fines restitutions and 
recoveries during the first half of the fiscal year snead 
reported 
the main hunting ground for inspectors looking at program 
overpayments is usdas agricultural stabilization and conservation 
service or ascs which has a nationwide network of state and 
county offices 
financing of the programs is handled by the commodity credit 
corp or ccc a wholly owned department corporation 
the report noted many other procedural and fraudulent 
infractions relating to commodity programs a common violation was 
the unauthorized disposal of mortgaged property grain or other 
commodities stored by farmers under price support loan 
in one case a nebraska farmer was accused of converting 25000 
bushels of cccmortgaged corn to his own use the ascs inspectors 
found a black plastic and wire mesh structure covered with a small 
amount of corn under the hatches of his bins 
the farmer allegedly rigged the device to give the impression 
that the bins were full when ascs inspected them the report 
said other bins contained bales of hay under the corn trial is 
pending 
other instances of illegal practices included a rural electric 
cooperative manager being convicted to racketeering conspiracy and 
mail fraud improper use of imported vegetable oil in domestic and 
export food donations and the continuing problems of overpayments 
and fraud by some grocers handling food stamps 
investigations are also continuing to identify illegal food 
stamp recipients through computer matchups 
we conducted the matches to identify federal employees 
participating in the food stamp program but not reporting wages 
and to identify recipients who are crossing state lines to work but 
not reporting wages the report said these matching efforts 
are in addition to state matching requirements 
inspectors said more than 400 federal employees and retirees out 
of about 9000 identified by computers were found to be getting 
food stamps illegally 
these individuals received program benefits because they had 
not reported their federal incomes properly the report said 
in all they were found to have received nearly 526000 in 
excessive stamp benefits and more than 650000 in excessive aid to 
families with dependent children and medicaid benefits

a supreme court ruling that permits the 
federal government to send state national guard troops abroad for 
peacetime training will bar governors from playing politics with 
foreign policy says a member of congress 
rep gv sonny montgomery dmiss chief sponsor of a 1986 
law upheld unanimously by the court on monday said the decision is 
a relief 
we just couldnt afford to have a few governors play politics 
with this issue just because they objected to the foreign policy 
objectives of the administration he said 
the socalled montgomery amendment prohibits any governor from 
withholding consent to a national guard units active duty outside 
the country because of an objection to the location purpose or 
schedule of the duty 
democratic gov rudy perpich of minnesota challenged the law in 
an appeal supported by several other governors 
attorney general hubert h humphrey iii of minnesota said he was 
disappointed by the ruling john tunheim a deputy in humphreys 
office who argued the case before the high court said he was not 
surprised by the decision 
tunheim said the ruling is in line with recent decisions 
broadening federal powers at the expense of the states 
in other actions monday the court 
ruled 54 that congress violated freespeech rights when it 
outlawed flag burning last year the decision immediately set off a 
new political fight over amending the constitution to protect the 
american flag 
gave police broad new power to stop and question someone based 
on anonymous tips the 63 ruling reinstated an alabama womans 
drug conviction 
ruled 72 that the federal government can cut benefits paid 
to recipients who relied on a government workers incorrect answers 
about their eligibility 
refused to let a private jewish group display a menorah in a 
public park near the burlington vt city hall 
agreed to study the power of federal prosecutors to seize 
sexually explicit material and business records from distributors 
of adult books and films 
among those who opposed the montgomery amendment was democratic 
gov michael dukakis of massachusetts who made federal control 
over national guard troops an issue in his unsuccessful 1988 
presidential campaign 
dukakis had opposed sending national guard troops to train in 
central america denouncing the reagan administration in 1988 for 
what he called a failed and illegal policy of supporting the 
nicaraguan contra rebels 
he said sending national guard troops to the region was an 
attempt to intimidate nicaragua 
the justice department had called dukakis position a dagger 
aimed at the heart of national defense 
by contrast perpich did not criticize reagan or bush 
administration foreign policy but emphasized states rights he 
said the constitution gives states veto power over peacetime 
training missions for national guard members 
perpich did not object when 12 members of a minnesota national 
guard public relations unit happened to be training in panama last 
december when us forces invaded to capture gen manuel noriega 
the minnesota troops returned to the united states a day after the 
invasion began 
it was enacted after several governors said they opposed the 
reagan administrations central american policy and did not want 
national guard troops from their states assigned to training 
missions in that region 
the bush administration said perpichs challenge to the federal 
law was illogical because the governor did not contest the federal 
governments power to order national guard troops to fight a war 
abroad but said the federal government lacked authority to train 
the troops for war 
there has been dual control over the national guard since 
congress made it a component of the army in 1933 
there are some 460000 men and women in the army national guard 
and 115000 in the air national guard 
anyone joining the national guard enrolls automatically in a 
state militia organization and a reserve component of the national 
armed forces 
the army national guard provides 46 percent of the armys combat 
units and 28 percent of its support forces 
the air national guard provides 73 percent of the nations 
interceptor forces 25 percent of tactical fighters and 24 percent 
of tactical air support 
minnesotas appeal was supported by officials from iowa maine 
massachusetts ohio and vermont most other states sided with the 
federal government

affection says bob saget of abcs full house 
saget said he and other fathers in tv comedies are often 
insensitive incompetents because the basis for sitcoms is conflict 
and the conflict often comes from the father needing help 
for the show to work you got to make him a goober 
sometimes saget said in the june 16 issue of tv guide if the 
fathers not a bit bumbling and the kids are not on top of it 
wheres the comedy

lighter moments like a dad who has problems cooking a meal or 
changing a diaper or talking about something serious but i find a

gov bob martinez signed oilspill 
prevention and cleanup legislation he called the nations most 
comprehensive as a supertanker fire off texas highlighted the 
threat to coastal states 
this legislation puts florida in a much better position to 
deal with an oil spill and even to prevent one from happening in 
the first place martinez said monday 
the law a compromise with oil shippers and retailers was 
prompted by last years exxon valdez spill in alaska 
martinez noted that firefighters were battling to keep a burning 
norwegian supertanker with 38 million gallons of oil from sinking 
in the gulf of mexico off galveston texas 
these are real problems that do occur martinez said to 
our knowledge theres not another state in the union that has a 
bill of this comprehensive nature dealing with oil spills 
i believe that others will begin to follow suit he said 
they have coastlines to protect and the only way to protect is 
to be able to immediately respond 
highlights of the law 
vessels and terminals must produce detailed spillresponse 
plans and terminals must buy equipment to contain a spill quickly 
only certified pilots or deputy pilots may move large ships in 
florida waters 
where oil and other pollutants are loaded and unloaded in large 
quantities terminal operators will have to use booms to seal off 
the waters around the ship in case a spill occurs 
liability limits for spill damage and cleanup costs for 
transporters and owners of cargo jump from 14 million to 50 
million 
fines of up to 25000 can be assessed if shippers or terminals 
fail to meet the laws provisions 
in addition if oil drilling is approved off floridas coast 
the cap on a state spillcleanup fund will double from 50 million 
to 100 million using an existing 2centabarrel excise tax on oil 
and other pollutants 
if the fund which now contains 32 million is depleted by a 
major spill the tax could be increased to 10 cents by the governor 
and cabinet 
environmentalists generally praised the law as a positive first 
step but said more must be done 
in particular the limits on cleanup liability for oil companies 
and shippers should be removed said ann whitfield of the florida 
public interest research group she noted the 2 billion cost of 
the exxon valdez spill 
this is a dramatic improvement but it still maintains the 
principle that the oil industry should be protected from cleanup 
costs she said 
if they were not protected it would be a financial incentive 
for them to have the safety equipment to do the job

congress probably will have to approve another 
50 billion savings and loan bailout this year the senate banking 
committee chairman says but he warns against handing the 
administration a blank check 
in a twohour speech on the senate floor sen donald w riegle 
jr dmich said congress will have to act probably later 
this year to provide additional funds 
new legislation will be needed to provide new monies 
probably in amounts comparable to what the sampl bill provided last 
year he said 
riegles speech followed the dramatic increase last month in the 
administrations estimate of the cost of rescuing the thrift 
industry 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady told riegles panel it 
would cost between 89 billion and 132 billion until then the 
administration had insisted sampl failures mostly could be handled by 
50 billion in longterm borrowing authority provided last year 
brady had suggested congress consider providing indefinite 
authority for the administration to spend whatever it takes to 
meet the governments obligation to back insured sampl deposits 
however riegle said i believe the blank check approach 
would be dangerous and would interfere with congress power to 
oversee the bailout 
on related topics riegle 
said there is scant evidence of significant progress in 
selling assets the government has inherited from failed sampls 
instead of concentrating on hardtosell problem real estate the 
rtc has focused on easy sales he said 
criticized the administration for resisting congressional 
efforts to earmark more money for prosecuting thrift fraud the 
justice department sought and received only 50 million of the 75 
million authorized by congress riegle said thats not enough to 
attack a backlog of more than 1300 major fraud cases 
rebuked the treasury departments office of thrift supervision 
for failing to provide current information on the financial 
condition of the sampl industry the offices predecessor the 
federal home loan bank board had provided monthly reports with a 
lag of about two months however the most recent report from the 
thrift office is current only through the end of december

closer ties between the united states and 
mexico under a planned free trade treaty would undercut lowwage 
countries in asia which compete with mexico for sales of their 
goods and for foreign investment analysts say 
president bush and mexican president carlos salinas de gortari 
announced monday they had agreed to start talks on a free trade 
agreement like the one between the united states and canada 
a free trade agreement would break down barriers between the two 
countries and encourage businesses to build new factories for 
lowcost mexican labor it would promote sales of us machinery in 
mexico and mexican farm products in the united states 
by creating new jobs in mexico it could discourage migration to 
this country 
eventually the pact could be linked with the free trade accord 
that the united states signed with canada in 1988 and create the 
single north american trade zone that bush promised in his 
presidential campaign 
figures recently issued by the labor department showed that in 
1987 the most recent year for which data was available the cost 
of hiring a worker in mexico was 157 an hour that compared with 
179 in south korea 212 in hong kong 231 in singapore and 
1340 in this country 
a free trade agreement with the united states would make mexico 
even more attractive to investors 
while eastern europe also has low wages it has different 
problems 
the eastern europeans arent ready to do a great deal of 
exporting to the united states said ernest l preeg a former 
state department official who now works for the center for 
strategic and international studies 
preeg and nora lustig a visiting fellow at the brookings 
institution said the main shortrun effect of free trade talks 
should be to encourage investment in mexico business people would 
be reassured by the prospect of steady sales in the huge us 
market for mexican products 
ms lustig a former consultant to the mexican government said 
she saw textiles and electronics as two important areas where 
mexico would have much to offer investors in competition with 
asian countries 
she noted that mexico also has an advantage over other 
competitors in its proximity and low transport costs to the united 
states she said she expected to see more development of industry 
near the usmexican border 
she and preeg both pointed out that the psychological effect of 
a free trade agreement will be visible long before the agreement is 
signed 
preeg predicted that in addition to us and canadian investors 
moneyed people of other industrial countries will want to start 
manufacturing in a place where costs are low and restrictions few 
on sales to the united states 
in addition confidence could also bring home some of the 
billions of dollars that wealthy mexicans have invested abroad in 
past years 
among advantages for the united states ms lustig pointed to 
prospects for sale of machinery to equip the new factories in 
mexico and the possibility of making auto parts for less 
for mexico ms lustig listed prospects of sales in the united 
states of food products some of them now restricted by us 
regulations avocados potatoes prunes and chocolates among 
others 
not everyone sees the prospects so favorably last week lane 
kirkland head of the aflcio and shirley carr head of the 
canadian labor congress predicted more unemployment and the 
creation of few highwage jobs in the united states and canada from 
a usmexico free trade agreement 
in a speech prepared for the business roundtable on monday 
night salinas replied 
to assume that the creation of new jobs in mexico will be 
attained at the expense of the american worker is to ignore 
mexicos enormous potential as a market for us exports and the 
complementarity of our economies he said 
mexicos senate dominated by salinas party of revolutionary 
institutions recommended a free trade treaty on may 22 but senate 
president maximiliano silerio esparza warned that some mexicans 
especially trade unions and business owners fearful of us 
competition oppose closer ties as increasing mexican dependence 
on the united states

three rounds of bargaining have produced 
little progress in resolving a contentious trade dispute with japan 
over sales of amorphous metals us officials report 
following a day of discussions monday a us trade official 
said the japanese are refusing to comply with us demands to 
remove barriers to sale of the product invented by allied signal 
inc of morristown nj 
the trade official who briefed reporters on condition of 
anonymity said the talks have gotten only about 10 percent of the 
way toward a settlement he said another round of bargaining would 
be held in midsummer 
the official said the japanese are contending they need more 
time to test the product for which allied signal won the patent in 
1973 amorphous metals marketed under the name metglas are used 
in electric transformers to cut energy transmission losses 
they want to spend the next two to three years testing the 
official said we are saying if they wanted to they could get 
this thing moving a lot faster 
the dispute is considered a major test case of the bush 
administrations efforts to break down japanese trade barriers 
because it involves a hightechnology product with a potential for 
40 million to 50 million in annual sales in japan 
allied signal contends it has been unfairly blocked from selling 
its invention in japan for more than a decade because the japanese 
want to foster development of a rival amorphous metals product to 
be sold when the allied signal patent runs out in 1993 
last april us trade representative carla hills postponed 
taking any action on the allied signal petition for economic 
sanctions against japan saying she would first seek a negotiated 
settlement of the dispute she set a sept 15 deadline for reaching 
such a settlement 
allied signal sold 18000 electric transformers using amorphous 
metals in the united states last year and projects us sales will 
reach 50000 new units this year

after seven weeks in space the hubble 
telescope still gets the shakes on each of the nearly 15 sunrises 
and sunsets it encounters a day and it gets a sudden memory loss in 
a region known as the south atlantic anomaly 
while the problems cant be fixed engineers are preparing 
computer commands to counter the effects jean olivier one of 
nasas top telescope engineers said monday 
the two 40feetlong solar arrays which convert sunlight into 
electricity set up vibration in the telescope each time it passes 
from day to night and from night to day the problem has persisted 
since the hubble was put into orbit on april 25 
this solar array dynamics is beginning to rear its head as a 
limiting factor in our ability to effectively carry this work 
out olivier said we probably would have been along further 
than we are today 
until we get this corrected we are in the process of working 
the changes to the software we are kind of hampered in our 
efficiency 
the telescope circles the earth at an altitude of 281 miles 
every 97 minutes 148 times a day encountering a sunrise and 
sunset each time the vibration lasts up to six minutes each time 
the instrument passes from day to night and 20 minutes going from 
night to day 
analyses both in europe and in this country have determined that 
heat causes a bowing in poles called bistems that pulled the 
ribbonlike solar panels from cassettes where they were rolled up 
much like a pulldown window shade 
the solution olivier said is to program computers to put in a 
counterforce to dampen the vibration that will be done in the 
coming weeks he said 
the other problem involves the electronics of the telescopes 
fine guidance sensors whenever the spacecraft flies over the south 
atlantic anomaly radiation affects the electronic bits that 
make up computer memory instructions and commands 
the anomaly is a region off the coast of brazil where radiation 
that surrounds the earth in the socalled van allen belt dips down 
to near the telescopes orbit the closer the telescope is to that 
area olivier said the more its electronics are affected 
if it goes through the center its in there 10 minutes he 
said its at the very center that the radiation is worst 
the solution for that problem which will be with the telescope 
during its 15year lifetime is a software program that will 
automatically refresh the electronics memory 10 times a second 
ed weiler project scientist for the telescope said that the 
problems have put the startup work on the project at least three 
weeks behind schedule but he said the science instruments check 
is ahead of schedule and all are working fine

the us department of energy cannot invoke 
sovereign immunity to avoid paying environmental fines to the state 
of ohio for the governments fernald uranium plant a federal 
appeals court has ruled 
the ruling monday by the 6th us circuit court of appeals means 
the department must pay ohio 125000 
the court upheld a lower court ruling that congress waived the 
departments traditional immunity from civil claims under two key 
environmental laws 
ohio had sued the energy department in 1986 trying to impose 
fines for improper hazardous waste disposal and release of 
radioactive materials at the plant which operated from 1952 until 
last summer when it was shut for cleanup 
in a 1988 settlement the energy department agreed to pay 
750000 to ohio and an additional 250000 half to ohio and half 
to the us treasury if it lost the appeal 
the amount isnt as important as the sting of defeat said 
jack van kley an assistant ohio attorney general its more 
important that the federal government violated the law and was 
penalized 
lawyers for the energy department did not immediately return 
calls for comment 
because of the 1988 agreement a federal court in cincinnati 
never ruled on the substance of case whether the energy department 
and its contractors should be fined for improperly handling 
hazardous waste or polluting air or water 
the issue the energy department was appealing was the federal 
courts ruling that the government under the resource conservation 
and recovery act and the clean air act waived its immunity from 
lawsuits 
the plant 18 miles northwest of cincinnati processes uranium for 
nuclear weapons 
neighbors of the plant won a 78 million settlement last summer 
claiming its contamination lowered property values and caused 
emotional distress 
hazardous wastes stored at fernald date back to the manhattan 
project which developed the atomic bomb during world war ii a 
citizen watchdog group has said barrels of hazardous and chemical 
wastes are rusting and leaking 
the environmental protection agency is supervising the cleanup 
which is expected to take as long as 50 years

mayor marion barry embattled by drug charges 
still plans to abandon a reelection bid but aides say he wants to 
make the announcement without appearing to be pressured into doing 
so 
barry aides said the mayor had planned to make that announcement 
monday in a television interview but didnt do so because of 
publicity surrounding his discussions with civil rights leader 
jesse jackson and the efforts of others to get barry to abandon his 
reelection plans 
there have been some intrusive parties jesse and others 
said one source close to barry who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the man wants to act on his own without seeming to be pushed 
around 
barry has decided he must forgo plans for seeking a fourth 
fouryear term in this novembers election if he hopes to restart 
stalled pleabargain talks in his drug possession and perjury 
trial several sources have said 
the mayor has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine 
possession charges one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge and 
three felony counts of lying to a grand jury about his alleged drug 
use 
meanwhile selection of a jury to hear barrys case in us 
district court is continuing with the aim of seating a panel by 
weeks end ten people were added to the pool on monday bringing 
the number of potential jurors to 58 
plea discussions which started more than two weeks ago broke 
down last week with us attorney jay b stephens insisting that 
barry plead guilty to a felony charge and the mayor willing to 
consider only a misdemeanor plea sources familiar with the 
situation have said 
the talks have not revolved around barrys reelection plans 
the sources said 
barry interviewed on whurfm radio monday night denied any 
kind of linkage 
those have been false reports he said my defense team 
has not asked for or sought any plea bargain moreover theres 
been an effort to link that to any political decision that i may 
make 
there is no linkage there is no connection between the two 
any decision i make about my political future will be made 
independent of the legal case the mayor said 
but several aides who met with barry on sunday insisted that he 
has decided not to run 
when he announces it it may be one of those things where he 
tells no one except a couple of close advisers one aide said 
he wants to avoid that circus atmosphere

the southern baptist conventions phenomenal 
growth in the late 1960s and 70s dramatized the resurgence of 
religious conservatives 
now weakened by internal strife between moderates and 
fundamentalists the denomination that pledged in 1976 to reach 
every person in the world with the gospel of jesus christ by the 
year 2000 is struggling to hold its own 
the 149millionmember church grew by barely half a percent 
last year and experienced its first decline in foreign missionaries 
in nearly 20 years 
and even after 11 straight presidential victories by the 
fundamentalist wing the theological and political war rages over 
how to interpret the bible and share authority within the nations 
largest protestant denomination 
welcome to the battle of new orleans 1990 version is how 
convention spokesman alvin c shackleford greeted reporters at the 
denominations annual meeting 
more than 30000 delegates or messengers are expected for 
the threeday meeting opening today the presidential election was 
set for today 
the church more than doubled membership since the mid60s to 
surge past the declining united methodist church as the nations 
secondlargest denomination behind the 55 millionmember roman 
catholic church 
but the churchs gain of 95000 members last year was a rise of 
only 64 percent the secondsmallest increase since 1936 
giving to denominational programs increased 189 percent to 
1373 million less than half the average 463 percent increase of 
the last five years and far lower than the 1039 percent increases 
throughout the 1970s 
and for the first time since 1972 the number of foreign 
missionaries declined dropping 87 to 3867 
the controversy that is blamed for the churchs decline dates to 
1979 when a group of fundamentalists concerned about liberal 
tendencies in the church began the first in a series of campaigns 
for control of the denomination 
the churchs moderate wing since has expressed increasing 
concerns it is being shut out in some cases the moderates have 
held back financial support 
the conservatives contend the bible is free from error even in 
its historical and scientific claims 
the moderates charge the fundamentalists are chipping away at 
the concept that church members have the ability to interpret the 
bible for themselves 
on specific issues fundamentalists are more likely to support 
school prayer and oppose legalized abortion and ordination of women 
some moderates said it is critical they stop their losing streak 
this year 
to say that this convention is an important convention is an 
understatement this is a crucial convention said the rev 
daniel vestal of suburban atlanta who lost the presidency last 
year to the rev c jerry vines of jacksonville fla 
vestals opponent this year the rev morris chapman of wichita 
falls texas asked a group of hispanic ministers sunday to help 
southern baptists complete the course correction that he said 
would make the denomination the first to ever reverse a trend away 
from believing the bible cant be wrong

veterans said the us supreme court decision striking down the 
flagburning law shows that the way to protect old glory is by 
constitutional amendment civil libertarians said such a move would 
itself be a desecration 
the 1989 law was a thinly veiled attempt by congress to avoid 
the issues of a constitutional amendment which will protect our 
nations flag american legion commander miles epling said at 
national headquarters in indianapolis 
the high court monday ruled 54 that congress violated 
freespeech rights when it outlawed flag burning 
william ramsey of the nebraska freedoms foundation board said he 
supports whatever it takes to protect the flag 
its sad we have to do anything he said it should be a 
matter of common decency that we respect such a symbol of freedom 
its a sad day 
r jack powell executive director of the paralyzed veterans of 
america said of the ruling this seems to clearly indicate that 
those who felt a constitutional amendment was necessary all along 
are right 
but harvard law professor lawrence tribe said it would 
desecrate the constitution to carve out an exception to the first 
amendment and i hope the house and senate resist that temptation 
i think its a proper decision i hope it doesnt lead to a 
panic to adopt a constitutional amendment to override it said 
civil rights lawyer william kunstler that would be a tragedy for 
all americans 
one decorated vietnam war veteran on capitol hill sen bob 
kerrey dneb called amendment efforts a mistake he urge 
restraint 
i think the current need is fueled by things that we need to 
control a bit and the emotional response that we feel when we see 
people damaging the flag should not lead us to amend our 
constitution said the medal of honor recipient

racial divisions after a judge handed down maximum prison terms to 
two young white men for their roles in the mob attack that left a 
black teenager dead 
justice thaddeus owens imposed the sentences monday for what a 
prosecutor called neanderthaltype behavior by whites who 
jumped and shot 16yearold yusuf hawkins after he ventured into 
mostly white bensonhurst on aug 23 
joseph fama 19 named by prosecutors as the triggerman was 
sentenced to 32 and twothirds years to life in prison for murder 
and other crimes 
keith mondello 19 identified as the ringleader drew five and 
onethird to 16 years in prison plus a 2000 fine he had been 
acquitted of murder and manslaughter but convicted of riot and 
other offenses 
fama and mondello each must serve the lower range of their 
sentences before they become eligible for parole 
the slaying heightened racial tensions during the campaign that 
resulted in dinkins election as new yorks first black mayor the 
verdict in mondellos case in may set off rock and bottlethrowing 
melees by blacks in brooklyn 
in a statement from city hall dinkins said the stiff 
sentences imposed today speak for themselves 
now that the criminal justice system has spoken we all must 
join our hearts heads and hands together to rid our city of the 
racism that destroys lives and communities he said we have 
had enough of tragedy together we must and we will move the 
healing process forward

black people all over the state

son not my son shouted his mother josephine fama

to look at a used car a mob of whites having been warned by 
mondellos exgirlfriend about outsiders set upon the black 
teenagers with baseball bats 
assistant district paul burns arguing for the maximum term 
called the killing a neanderthaltype of behavior 
we need to send the message to every community that we will 
not tolerate senseless violence the prosecutor said

nepal the worlds only hindu kingdom 
will free all christian prisoners who were jailed by the former 
government for illegal proselytizing the royal palace said today 
the palace said in a statement king birendra has granted 
amnesty to all religious prisoners on the advice of prime 
minister krishna prasad bhattarai in view of the new political 
environment in the country 
currently 29 christians including 14 children younger than age 
18 are serving sentences for proselytizing there are no religious 
prisoners of other faiths a human rights report recently said 144 
other christians were in police custody across the country facing 
trial 
the royal statement said king birendra has given instructions 
for the dismissal of all cases against persons awaiting trial for 
religious activities 
a home ministry official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said orders had already been issued to prison authorities to set 
free the 29 imprisoned christians 
we believe this is the lords doing said samuel sotemba 
the pastor of nepal christian fellowship a local church that like 
hundreds of other protestant churches in nepal operates 
unofficially 
the amnesty appeared to be the first step towards nepalese 
church leaders demand that the new prodemocracy government change 
a 32yearold law banning religious conversion 
human rights activists in nepal say the countrys christians 
have faced widespread persecution by previous governments that were 
dominated by the monarchy 
a popular movement in april forced king birendra to loosen his 
grip on power and appoint prodemocracy leaders to government 
offices 
although the current constitution which will soon be rewritten 
allows freedom of religion it prescribes a oneyear prison term 
for freely converting oneself to another religion three years for 
an attempt to convert someone else and six years for successfully 
converting others 
christian leaders say there are between 35000 and 40000 
christians in the country but government records put the number at 
3000 
about 75 percent of the himalayan kingdoms 17 million people 
are hindus 5 percent moslems and 3 percent buddhists

a delta rocket lifted into orbit 
today an indian communications satellite that was grounded a year 
because of damage first from a launch pad accident and then the 
california earthquake 
the unmanned rocket thundered skyward the moon in the 
background at 152 am about an hour later the satellite 
separated from the rocket and settled into a temporary orbit 130 
miles high 
the satellite will reach a circular orbit 22300 miles high in 
10 days said sastri vasantha project director of indias 
department of space 
mcdonnell douglas launch commentator ray adams said the rocket 
went right down the middle of the path 
thats the way we like to see them fly he said 
abid hussain indias ambassador to the united states said 
monday the satellite will spread education and knowledge science 
and new culture to hundreds and thousands of those who have been 
out of the mainstream of life 
india has 800 million people its communications are mostly 
guided by land facilities and there are hundreds and thousands of 
villages that are remote from the metropolitan cities and we have 
not been able to reach there hussain 
the 80 million insat satellite will replace one that was 
deployed in 1983 by the shuttle challenger 
once it becomes operational in midjuly the satellite will send 
video and voice signals to tv radio and disasterwarning 
receivers and transmit weather observations to a forecasting 
center in new delhi 
mcdonnell douglas rocket and launch services cost nearly 50 
million it was the fourth commercial launch of a delta 
the satellite was scheduled to ride a delta rocket into orbit 
last june which would have made it americas first commercial 
launch to reach orbit but a cable on a crane broke and dropped a 
heavy hook on the satellite 10 days before liftoff 
ford aerospace which built the satellite returned the 
spacecraft to palo alto calif and replaced an antenna and made 
other repairs at a cost of 10 million 
the earthquake that struck northern california in october caused 
further damage about a dozen cells in the satellites solar 
panels had to be replaced at a cost of about 150000 
ford aerospace insured the satellite for any problems on the 
ground the indian government which also has insurance assumed 
responsibility after liftoff 
because of the oneyear delay india has had to lease the 
services of other satellite communications companies vasantha 
said the insat satellite that will be replaced is operating at 
about 70 percent capacity he said 
the new craft is the fourth and final in a series of indias 
insat 1 satellites it has a working lifetime of seven years an 
updated version the insat 2 will be carried into space next year 
by europes ariane rocket

journalists stood on street corners hawking 
a newspaper they published on their own after launching norways 
first newspaper strike in 44 years 
the 32page tabloid avisa the norwegian word for newspaper 
appeared on monday a day after wage negotiations collapsed it 
competed with regular newspapers that succeeded in publishing thin 
monday editions 
the norwegian union of journalists had ordered strikes at eight 
major newspapers and the national news service ntb said union 
officer bente sabel 
norways publishers association responded by locking out 
reporters from 57 other newspapers 
most of the 65 newspapers published monday editions filled 
mainly with advertisements 
in all about 2000 journalists were on strike or locked out 
employers offered less than half the journalists demand of a 
457 percent increase on their 34460 average annual salary 
reports said 
in our view it is mostly a wage problem said tore 
cappelen the publishers chief negotiator 
cappelen said it was too early to attempt new talks a lot 
depends on what happens with nrk he said journalists at the 
state nrk radio and television network have also threatened to 
strike 
sabel said the closest they came to new talks was when i sold 
a copy of avisa to a publishers negotiator 
the union founded in 1946 has claimed it is ready to make its 
first strike a long one and to publish avisa and similar 
newspapers daily 
mondays avisa edition was delayed and limited to 10000 
copies due to problems in buying newsprint sabel said

sir james carreras who as head of hammer films 
produced horror movies that scared the daylights out of a whole 
generation of filmgoers has died according to a family death 
notice published today he was 81 
carreras died peacefully on saturday of a stroke at his home at 
henleyonthames west of london the notice said 
known as a mildmannered family man carreras always said the 
ghastly monsters with which hammer films filled screens around the 
world were harmless escapist entertainment 
carreras built up the hammer company after world war ii and in 
the mid1950s began making the gruesome lowbudget horror films 
for which the british studio became internationally famous 
his first big hit and the first hammer film to be distributed in 
the united states was the quatermass experiment based on a 
1954 television science fiction series 
the horror aspects of that film inspired carreras to look for 
material among the monsters popular with film fans in the 1930s he 
raised from the dead frankenstein dracula and other creepy 
characters of legend and novel who had faded from the screen 
the curse of frankenstein in 1956 struck an immediate chord 
with the public who liked its fantastic sets garish color and 
melodramatic plot hammer horror films boosted the careers of two 
actors who became synonymous with escapist horror fare peter 
cushing and christopher lee 
dracula with lee in the title role and cushing as van 
helsing followed frankenstein and several sequels were made to 
each lee played dracula in nearly a dozen films 
the sound stage at hammer was filled at one time or another with 
dr jekyll and mr hyde jack the ripper and sherlock holmes in 
the hound of the baskervilles 
carreras shunned the creative side of filmmaking preferring the 
role of impresario born june 9 1909 he inherited his flair for 
showmanship from his father enrique carreras the owner of a chain 
of london movie theaters 
carreras made sure films were shot quickly and cheaply and 
played a role in the british film industry similar to that played 
by roger corman in hollywood 
like corman carreras made films that were the objects of 
critical scorn but developed a strong cult following the company 
did not hold press screenings but devoted resources and 
imagination to promotion 
in one typical carrerasinspired stunt coffins were carried 
through the streets to promote the opening of a horror film 
the hammer company also produced pirate adventures war epics 
bloody thrillers and a peculiar prehistoric yarn one million 
years bc which helped make a star of a little known american 
actress named raquel welch 
even in the 1970s films under carreras rarely cost more than a 
modest 200000 pounds 336000 at current exchange rates at the 
studios height it produced eight films a year

university of utah president chase n 
peterson a cheerleader for the phantom phenomenon of tabletop 
fusion is retiring under fire for a hidden 500000 transfer of 
money toward its development 
peterson 60 said monday he would retire next year but had no 
intention of resigning under pressure 
in a resolution last week the facultys academic senate had 
questioned petersons ability to run the 23500student university 
in light of the furor over the money transfer peterson has held 
the post since 1983 
the president acknowledged that the period of time i can 
effectively provide leadership is nearing an end 
peterson had come under sharp criticism twice before in the past 
15 months first for the schools announcement of a breakthrough in 
the quest for fusion and then for his handling of a 15 million 
donation that later was returned 
last month controversy erupted when it became known that a 
500000 donation to the schools fusion research center that had 
been characterized by the university as an anonymous outside 
gift actually was the result of a petersonauthorized transfer of 
money from the schools research foundation 
peterson on june 1 said that hiding the origin of the donation 
was a mistake he said he had hoped to avoid jealousy within other 
departments but had hurt the credibility of the institute 
chemist b stanley pons of the university and british colleague 
martin fleischmann announced in march 1989 that they had achieved a 
sustained nuclear fusion reaction in a tabletop experiment the 
announcement held out the prospect of a cheap safe and virtually 
inexhaustible source of energy 
despite extreme scientific skepticism that continues today the 
legislature appropriated 5 million last fall to establish the 
national cold fusion institute at the school and to protect the 
states patent rights 
the center has tried to raise money from the government and 
corporations but has had limited success a department of energy 
panel recommended against funding and the only confirmed 
contribution was 50000 from utah power amp light co in march 
in june salt lake medical equipment manufacturer james l 
sorenson donated 15 million in pharmaceutical stock to the 
university with the understanding the medical school and hospital 
would be renamed in his honor 
peterson was forced to return the money after protests from 
doctors faculty and students 
pons said he was grateful for petersons support 
he made a strong effort to see it through we regret that it 
is an issue in his retirement decision pons said we still 
know that we are right and we are sure that soon he will be able 
to list cold fusion as one of the positive accomplishments by the 
university of utah 
critics lauded petersons decision to retire at the end of the 
199091 academic year 
i think that his timetable is entirely appropriate and his 
statement is appreciated by the faculty said sandra taylor a 
history professor who had introduced the academic senate resolution 
peterson was the schools vice president for health sciences 
when surgeons completed the first artificial heart implant in 1982 
on barney clark who died after 112 days on the device 
peterson became the universitys 11th president in 1983 
succeeding david p gardner 
his supporters most often cite his talent for fundraising 
we dont raise money we generate support for important 
programs peterson said in an interview monday night that 
support totaled 42 million this year while before i came the 
highest was 17 million 
donations for the last five years amounted to 207 million he 
said 
but peterson said the period in which he could effectively lead 
was nearing an end 
leadership needs to be rather forceful occasionally bold and 
likely occasionally wrong or judged to be wrong and 
occasionally bruising which probably means you shouldnt be here 
forever he said

a catastrophic spill from the burning supertanker 
mega borg couldnt come at a worse time of year for shellfish and 
birds on the texas coast environmentalists say 
the coast guard estimated the norwegian ship had spilled up to 
100000 gallons of its 38 milliongallon cargo of light crude much 
of the oil was being consumed by fires that erupted saturday 57 
miles southeast of galveston 
currents and winds were expected to push escaping oil toward a 
200mile stretch of coast between freeport and corpus christi but 
the coast guard said the currents also were expected to keep the 
spill from coming ashore 
roy hann a texas aampm environmental engineering professor said 
damage to the ecology would be catastrophic if millions of gallons 
reached the bays and estuaries along the central coast where fish 
hatch and birds nest 
gary clark president of the houston audubon society said the 
spill couldnt have happened at a worse time of year for 
shellfish and birds 
in midjune the immediate consequences on breeding birds would 
be devastating he said it could wipe out the brown pelican 
clark said light crude would be more devastating to birds over 
the shortterm because it floats and just a slight ingestion of 
light crude could kill numerous birds heavy crude which sinks 
to the bottom would have a longterm impact 
pat rogers who owns a seafood business in galveston and a fleet 
of shrimp boats said any oil that might make it to the ocean floor 
could kill the shrimp 
this is a critical time for the brown shrimp because theyre 
leaving the estuary areas for the gulf rogers said it 
couldnt be any more critical than what it is right now 
brown and white shrimp are the two species most often found in 
restaurants and major populations of the species are found in the 
area of the burning tanker 
the response to the disaster was delayed during the weekend as 
firefighting and oil containment equipment was brought in from 
louisiana alabama and even the netherlands 
what i guess disturbs me said clark is i dont 
understand why the texas coast the houston area doesnt have a 
wellcoordinated response to something like this its all 
reactionary its all ad hoc its all here after the fact 
i think we need to hold our public officials responsible in a 
big way he said there should have been equipment in place to 
take care of this thing right away

indias agreement to reopen border 
crossings should end the economic hardships suffered by landlocked 
nepal since new delhi imposed the restrictions 15 months ago 
indian newspapers said today 
prime ministers vp singh of india and krishna prasad bhattarai 
of nepal announced an agreement sunday on restoring trade and 
transit links and india agreed to reopen the border crossings by 
july 1 
today we have finally put an unfortunate interlude behind us 
and have fully normalized our relations singh told a news 
conference in announcing the agreement 
the agreement provides for concessions on customs duties for 
goods traded between the two countries and the dropping of 
restrictions on indian citizens seeking employment in nepal the 
two countries also agreed to consider their mutual security 
concerns 
major indian newspapers praised the agreement in editorials 
today 
the agreement will put an end to the hardships suffered by the 
people of nepal as a result of a major interruption in the flow of 
essential consumer goods said the independent indian express 
newspaper 
relations between the two neighbors soured in march 1989 when 
rajiv gandhi then indias prime minister closed 13 of the 15 
goods transit points on its border with nepal when trade and 
transit treaties expired 
gandhi imposed the restrictions after nepal refused to agree to 
indian demands for a single treaty covering both trade and transit 
india refused to renew the existing treaties 
india saw nepals refusal to negotiate a single treaty as 
reflecting a desire to forge economic ties with other countries at 
indias expense 
india also was apparently concerned about nepals increasingly 
close ties with its northern neighbor china in 1988 india 
opposed a decision by nepal to purchase a large quantity of 
antiaircraft weapons from china 
the border closings severely restricted the flow of imports to 
nepal which have to be transported overland from indian ports to 
the himalayan kingdom nepals exports are not significant 
during the past 15 months new governments took over in both 
countries and moved to resolve the disputes 
singhs national front coalition replaced gandhis government in 
december bhattarai was sworn in as head of an interim coalition 
government in april after an eightweek prodemocracy campaign 
forced king birendra to end a partyless system of government 
the new agreement basically restores the situation as it existed 
before march 1989 when the treaties expired the two countries have 
agreed to begin negotiations on new trade and transit treaties but 
did not set any date 
the absurdity of india waging a war of economic attrition 
against nepal with which it is closely bound by ties of history 
geography culture and economic independence is all too clear 
the hindu a conservative englishlanguage newspaper said

british airways said today that it has suspended 
an engineer at the airport where maintenance work was done on the 
jetliner that lost a windshield at 23000 feet sucking out the 
pilot 
pilot tim lancaster was saved by cabin staff who clutched his 
ankles as he was buffeted against the nose cone for 15 minutes on 
sunday until the copilot managed to bring the bac 111 down for an 
emergency landing 
the 41yearold pilot was recovering at southampton general 
hospital from broken bones bruises and frostbite 
british airways said the engineer based at a maintenance depot 
in the central england city of birmingham has been suspended with 
full pay the employee was not identified 
the suspension does not imply anything it is quite normal in 
an investigation like this said an airline spokesman who asked 
not to be identified in accordance with british custom 
the domestic british news agency press association quoting 
airline sources said the suspended engineer was directly involved 
in the routine replacement of the flight deck windows of the 
18yearold plane two days before the neardisaster 
british airways refused to confirm this but did say that the 
windows were replaced friday in birmingham 
investigators for the governments air accident investigation 
have recovered the 2by3foot windshield and have interviewed the 
flight crew 
the plane had taken off from birmingham in northern england 
carrying 81 holiday makers to malaga spain 
on monday lancaster met for an hour with his rescuers purser 
nigel ogden steward simon rogers and stewardess susan prince and 
posed with the trio smiling and barechested in his hospital bed 
they were magnificent if it was not for them i would not be 
here now he said of the crew 
lancaster responding to written questions from reporters said 
he remembered hearing a bang when the window blew out of the 
18yearold jet and then felt himself being pulled from his seat 
he was wearing a lap belt but had unfastened his shoulder 
harness after takeoff 
i remember the buffeting of the wind he said i tried to 
shout back at the crew but im sure they could not hear me 
he said the thought of death did cross my mind for a moment or 
two 
lancaster whose replies were relayed by a british airways 
spokesman said his first thought was that he had to keep breathing 
in the thin cold air 
he described the ordeal as extremely fast frantic and 
said he felt no pain during the 15 minutes it took the plane to 
land 
the 21year british airways veteran however said the 
experience would not make him stop flying

a hoaxer used a public relations firms 
answering machine to trick the news media into running a bogus 
story about elizabeth taylor a publicist says 
the story distributed worldwide by the associated press and 
united press international said miss taylor 58 was romantically 
involved with a 23yearold man and had undergone surgery over the 
weekend 
it is a hoax miss taylors publicist chen sam said 
monday i have contacted miss taylors attorneys and we are going 
to conduct an investigation it is apparently somebody using my 
telephone service 
ms sams new york city public relations firm has been the sole 
media link during miss taylors nineweek hospitalization for 
pneumonia at st johns hospital and health center in santa monica 
the sam organization has discouraged the news media from calling 
st johns about miss taylor and has instructed the hospitals 
public relations staff not to answer reporters questions under 
california privacy law hospitals must abide by the wishes of 
patients who dont want information released about them 
the hoaxer said miss taylor underwent an abdominal biopsy and 
was expected to be released from the hospital within two weeks on 
the arm of julian lee hobbs of lake orion mich described as miss 
taylors boyfriend 
hobbs is apparently an aspiring actor sometimes known as rory 
emerald newspaper editors in michigan say his representatives have 
pitched stories to them in the past but they doubted their veracity 
the ap office in los angeles had placed calls to the hospital 
and to chen sam and associates after receiving a message sunday 
from an ap affiliate in england the press association editors at 
the british domestic news agency had heard miss taylor had 
undergone another operation and wanted a story 
paulette weir the hospital spokeswoman was unavailable for 
comment sunday when the reporter called new york he was connected 
to ms sams answering service and left a message 
a short time later a woman returned the call saying she was 
lisa flowers from chen sam and associates she then gave the 
reporter the bogus information about miss taylors romantic 
involvement and the surgery 
the hoaxer also provided the same story to upi and city news 
service a metropolitan los angeles wire service 
the ap reporter in an effort to verify the authenticity of the 
source later placed a second call to ms sams answering service 
leaving a message for lisa flowers the answering service operator 
accepted that message without question 
later an ap reporter placed a third call to ms sams answering 
service a woman identifying herself as ms sam returned that call 
and verified the identity of ms flowers and the story she had 
told 
ms sam said monday that no one from her organization had talked 
to reporters on sunday 
ms sam said a woman involved in the hoax had telephoned 
billies registry her answering service and was given the 
publicists messages after somehow providing proper coded 
identification to the switchboard 
it was all very cleverly done ms sam said it was done 
on a sunday when we werent around i cant understand how they got 
the code ive had to change the entire system here 
billie mcdonald owner of the answering service said she 
couldnt offer any details about her staffs role in the hoax 
ms sam said miss taylor was still recuperating at the hospital 
and had not undergone any surgery over the weekend 
i was out there last week ms sam said shes looking 
wonderful and doing much better she should be there two more 
weeks

students formed a human chain around 
sofia university today and declared a strike over alleged 
government manipulation of what were billed as bulgarias first 
free elections in 58 years 
the longruling communists who have renamed themselves the 
socialist party as they strive to break with a repressive past 
appeared headed for a decisive victory in sundays elections 
initial official results announced today for 111 seats in the 
400seat parliament gave the socialists 68 seats against 32 for the 
main opposition alliance the union of democratic forces 
eight seats went to the mainly ethnic turkish rights and 
freedoms movement and the other three were split among lesser 
parties 
leaders of the 16party union of democratic forces claim a 
series of election irregularities affected the outcome of sundays 
first round of balloting 
they rejected the socialists offer to join a governing 
coalition and about 60000 opposition supporters staged a protest 
rally monday night outside election headquarters 
down with the red mafia and we wont work for the red 
they shouted today demonstrations forced the closure of several 
downtown roads 
today about 3000 students staged a strike against what they 
said were election manipulations some ringed a university 
building blocking entrances 
the socialists heir to the communists who have controlled this 
balkan nation since 1944 appeared on the verge of becoming the 
only communists to win a free election in an eastern european 
country newly free of the soviet orbit 
west german and bulgarian projections gave them about 48 percent 
of the vote the union of democratic forces was second with about 
36 percent 
in third place was the agrarian party a former docile communist 
ally that declared its independence this year with about 8 percent 
of the vote it was followed by the movement for rights and 
freedoms with about 57 percent 
the rest of the vote was divided among 34 other parties that 
fielded candidates 
half the seats in parliament are to be filled through races for 
singleseat constituencies the other half based upon parties 
proportional showing the results announced today were for 
singleseat constituencies 
sofia radio said runoffs would be held sunday in the at least 73 
districts where no single candidate won the necessary majority 
sixteen constituences apparently were not yet fully counted 
premier andrei lukanov a leading socialist party member went 
on television monday night and urged all parties to look beyond 
party passions and take part in a broad national coalition 
there are no losers in the present elections because in the 
final reckoning the victory of democracy is a victory for all he 
was quoted as saying by the bulgarian news agency bta 
but the unions chairman zhelyu zhelev told mondays rally 
that the opposition alliance would not form a coalition the former 
communists in the national assembly we will be a powerful 
opposition faction 
the union picked up immediate backing from the agrarian party 
and the alternative socialist party which split from the 
mainstream socialists because it favors more radical reforms 
the growing support for a united opposition means the socialists 
will probably have to tackle bulgarias growing inflation 10 
billion debt and consumer shortages alone 
the union favors a quick move to a westernstyle freemarket 
economy while the socialists favored slower reforms 
union spokesman georgi spasov alleged that irregularities in the 
voting included political agitation in front of polling stations 
petar beron a union official claimed that the irregularities 
made as much as a 6 percent difference in the vote he said the 
opposition coalition would seek another vote in some places 
western observers reported election irregularities but said they 
did not affect the overall results substantially 
with nearly a century as a strong political force in bulgaria 
the communist party was the known quantity the municipal and local 
party structures of the former communist party are largely intact 
in small towns and villages and have been taken over by the 
socialists 
according to the projections the union topped the socialists 
only in sofia with the socialists carrying the countryside and 
provincial cities 
the opposition had wanted the elections postponed until fall to 
allow more time for noncommunist parties to organize 
bulgaria had only a nascent opposition when reform communists 
ousted longtime communist strongman todor zhivkov last november

former national security adviser john m 
poindexter received a sixmonth sentence and a stern lecture from a 
judge who said he undermined democracy by lying to congress about 
the irancontra affair 
poindexter became the first of seven people convicted in the 
scandal to receive a prison term when he was sentenced monday by 
us district judge harold h greene 
the judge said poindexter who plans to appeal deserved 
incarceration as the decisionmaking head of the irancontra 
operation 
probation would be tantamount to a statement that a scheme to 
lie to and obstruct congress is of no great moment greene said 
poindexter who served as president reagans national security 
adviser from late 1985 until the irancontra scandal forced his 
resignation in november 1986 was convicted of conspiracy making 
false statements to congress and obstructing lawmakers inquiries 
into the irancontra affair 
greene said poindexter former white house aide oliver l north 
and others usurped political power from congress when they set up a 
covert operation to arm the contra rebels in nicaragua in defiance 
of a congressional ban on such aid 
when admiral poindexter and his associates obstructed the 
congress what were they seeking to accomplish the judge asked 
in a word it was to nullify the decision that body had made on 
the issue of supplies to the contras 
poindexter was found guilty of conspiring to thwart attempts by 
congress in 1986 to verify reports that north was coordinating the 
secret resupply operation for the rebels he was also convicted of 
lying and destroying documents to conceal the us role in a 1985 
shipment of hawk antiaircraft missiles to iran 
poindexters sentencing doesnt close the irancontra affair a 
newlyempaneled federal grand jury is trying to determine the 
precise roles of reagan thenvice president george bush cia 
officers and others in the case the grand jury probe is being 
conducted by the office of independent counsel lawrence walsh 
poindexter 53 a retired navy rear admiral made no statement 
in court and showed little emotion except to smile at his wife 
linda after the sentence was imposed the couple kissed and walked 
arminarm out of the courtroom 
outside the us district courthouse poindexter briefly joined 
a throng of about 30 demonstrators who held placards urging 
president bush to pardon the irancontra defendants and fire their 
prosecutor independent counsel walsh 
his car drove off to the strains of anchors aweigh which 
was broadcast over loudspeakers set up by the demonstrators who 
chanted full pardon now 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater declined to comment on 
the sentence asked if he would rule out a pardon by president 
bush fitzwater said i can rule out having any comment on this 
matter while the case is under appeal 
greene said poindexter violated a principle fundamental to 
this constitutional republic that those elected by and 
responsible to the people shall make important policy decisions 
it is unfortunate that whatever may be his view of his own 
purposes and actions the defendant still gives no evidence or 
recognizing that principle and the seriousness of its violation 
the judge said 
the judge did not impose any fine saying poindexter had already 
amassed large legal bills the former national security adviser was 
allowed to remain free pending appeal of his conviction 
defense attorney richard w beckler urged greene to show 
leniency because of poindexters 33 years of service as a navy 
officer 
he cared for his country he cared for his family beckler 
said all his life he set an example of dedication of service to 
his country 
prosecutor dan k webb there is nothing about this mans 
background that would have predicted he would have committed 
five serious felony offenses yet the jurys verdict stands as a 
monument to that fact 
afterward webb said the term imposed by greene was a very 
fair and very proper sentence that would warn other public 
officials 
both the judge and webb noted that poindexter sought leniency 
without expressing any regrets or remorse 
greene said that under sentencing guidelines that took effect 
after the irancontra affair poindexter could have been sentenced 
to between 21 and 27 months 
but the judge said that it would be unfair to impose that long a 
sentence while other irancontra defendants received the benefits 
of probation community service or fine 
north drew 1200 hours of community service and a 150000 fine 
and robert mcfarlane poindexters predecessor as national security 
adviser received two years probation a 20000 fine and 200 
hours of community service

senate majority leader george mitchell 
criticizing the bush administrations cambodia policy says hes 
determined to find out if any american money is reaching the khmer 
rouge 
mitchell said congress passed a law in 1985 that bars the khmer 
rouge from getting any military help direct or indirect from 
the united states 
it appears that there is reason to question whether this law 
is being obeyed mitchell said adding that the senate 
intelligence committee plans to hold oversight hearings into us 
policy on cambodia and the administrations compliance with the law 
the administration has denied that the khmer rouge benefits from 
us aid but president bush said last month he ordered a review of 
uscambodia policy saying he was troubled by the perception that 
the united states is aiding the khmer rouge 
to the degree it has any effect to help them yes i am 
uncomfortable about that he told reporters 
mitchells attack monday is the third time he has sparred with 
the administration in recent weeks 
in the literal sense of the word the bush administrations 
cambodia policy is incredible it is insupportable and it must be 
changed mitchell said 
last week the maine democrat criticized president bush for 
granting trade benefits to the soviet union without obtaining 
concessions on lithuania and he has vowed to try to thwart 
extension of a trade pact with china because of that countrys 
human rights policies 
china is also involved in cambodia mitchell said 
it is time to admit that china does not share our goals in 
cambodia he said it is time for american policy to reflect 
american goals 
the chinese are the prime sponsors of the khmer rouge the group 
that committed genocide in the 1970s he said the khmer rouge were 
driven from power by the vietnamese 
the khmer rouge along with two noncommunist factions have 
been trying to oust the vietnameseinstalled government 
the united states provides nonlethal assistance to two 
noncommunist guerrilla groups in cambodia one headed by prince 
sihanouk and the other by son sen 
mitchell said the noncommunists like the khmer rouge also get 
support from the chinese joined in a coalition they do not 
fight against the khmer rouge they fight with the khmer rouge 
he said 
increasingly there are reports of tactical and strategic 
military cooperation between sihanouks forces and the khmer 
rouge he said moreover it is alleged that all factions share 
intelligence information during battlefield operations he said 
mitchell said the united states is making a big mistake by 
refusing to talk with the hun sen government the current regime 
is not ideal but it is not the khmer rouge 
mitchell urged the administration to use its influence to 
divorce the noncommunists from the khmer rouge to state that it 
will not support any future government that includes the khmer 
rouge and to ease restrictions of us development aid for the 
cambodians 
he also said the khmer rouge should be stripped of their 
representation of cambodia at the united nations 
the state department has said it opposes any return to power of 
the khmer rouge but the cambodians themselves must determine their 
future in fair and free elections 
the united states supports a comprehensive settlement in 
cambodia which involves a major role for the united nations

the vast russian republic proclaimed its 
sovereignty today with a declaration that signaled a sharp break 
with the central soviet government but carried no legal force 
deputies of the russian congress who overwhelmingly approved 
the declaration stressed the move does not amount to a declaration 
of independence like that of the breakaway baltic republic of 
lithuania 
we didnt declare ourselves a separate government from the 
ussr said ruslan khasbulatov the congress deputy chairman 
we think our russian fate should be within the framework of the 
ussr 
the lawmakers last month elected as the republics president 
boris n yeltsin the populist reformer who backs a more radical 
shift to a market economy than soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
there was no immediate reaction by gorbachev who has warned 
that the kremlin cannot carry out its reforms if the russian 
heartland is not firmly behind it 
yeltsin had urged quick passage of the measure so that june 12 
could become russias independence day the vote was 90713 
and the result was met with applause and a standing ovation 
yeltsin stood and applauded the deputies 
earlier in the day deputies voted 704206 not to drop the 
soviet socialist from the republics formal name the russian 
soviet federated socialist republic 
todays declaration does not actually have any effect on the 
laws of russia by far the largest of the countrys 15 republics 
comprising twothirds of the countrys territory and just over half 
its population the declaration is however the basis for writing 
a new russian constitution 
passing a declaration that carried legal force khasbulatov 
said would have called forth a big crash 
the declaration solemnly proclaims the state sovereignty of 
the russian soviet federated socialist republic on all its 
territory and says laws of the russian federation should have 
priority over centrally dictated soviet laws 
the declaration says the republic has the right to secede from 
the soviet union under conditions to be stated in a future 
nationwide treaty but the proclamation serves only as a political 
statement of intent with no legal weight 
still it expresses the mood of decentralization in the 
country said vyacheslav maslennikov a consultant for the 
congress editorial commission 
the russian action falls far short of secessionist drives in the 
baltic republics of lithuania estonia and latvia 
the three baltic presidents formed a united front last month to 
press their drives to restore the independence they lost 50 years 
ago when forcibly annexed 
lithuania has gone the farthest toward secession by declaring 
its immediate independence on march 11 
a radical russian deputy mikhail maley said his wing had a 
great desire to pass a real declaration of sovereignty but 
conceded that lawmakers would not have accepted such a move 
yeltsin elected to the republics presidency last month has 
been a strong proponent of russian sovereignty he included it in 
his platform and predicted it would be declared in the first 100 
days of his tenure 
i think it has great political significance for our 
government khasbulatov a strong supporter of yeltsin said of 
the declaration its an extraordinary event for our country for 
our russia 
eventually he said russia would go on our own ideas 
especially in the area of economic reform he said the russian 
government hoped to take control of its own foreign trade 
yeltsin who has become gorbachevs political nemesis in the 
last two years has said he hopes to cooperate with the soviet 
president despite their personal and political differences but 
that his first priority is defending russias interests 
gorbachev who had opposed yeltsins election as president of 
the russian republic indicated last week he would seek a 
reconciliation with him 
what would disturb me more than anything at this stage is a 
split in the democratic forces he said that implied that he 
viewed yeltsin as an ally in the reform movement

tempers flared on the senate floor over the 
supreme courts decision to allow flag burning as republican and 
democratic leaders debated renewed calls for a constitutional 
amendment 
shortly after mondays ruling minority leader bob dole rkan 
urged action this week on a constitutional amendment protecting the 
flag from desecration and suggested that those who oppose it side 
with flag burners 
ill place my money on the young men and young women who serve 
in americans armed services dole said the rest can place 
their money on the jennifer campbells and the others involved in 
this flagburning case 
campbell 23 of seattle was one of four defendants accused 
last fall of violating a law against flag burning that democrats 
guided through congress last year to avoid a constitutional 
amendment 
as many predicted it would the supreme court on monday 
overturned the statute as an unconstitutional violation of first 
amendment guarantees of freedom of expression 
we pointed out that it would never work dole said of the 
1989 law its not as if we have to go back and reinvent the 
wheel weve had the debate were ready to take up the 
constitutional amendment 
senate democratic leader george mitchell of maine accused dole 
of demeaning those who on principle oppose opening the constitution 
up to what in effect would be the first change in the bill of 
rights 
the question before us is whether or not after 200 years the 
american bill of rights the most concise the most eloquent the 
most effective statement of individual liberty in all of human 
history is to be changed mitchell said 
you can debate the issue vigorously without suggesting for 
a moment that the senate is choosing between jennifer campbell and 
the men and women in our military service he added no such 
choice is before the senate or the country 
dole turned his back to mitchell walked to the rear of the 
senate chamber and conferred with an aide as the democratic leader 
continued his remarks 
sen patrick leahy dvt later took up mitchells theme 
calling doles request for senate action this week the fast food 
school of constitutional amendments 
some would rather debate symbols than reality that we have 
mortgaged our children and our childrens children that the 
united states has fallen behind japan and europe in our 
competitiveness leahy said 
mitchell said he wanted to confer with several people including 
dole and house leaders before deciding when to allow the senate to 
consider a flagburning amendment 
amending the constitution would require support from 67 of the 
100 senators and 290 of the 435 representatives it would then have 
to be ratified by the legislatures of at least 38 states

algerians cast ballots today in the 
countrys first contested elections since french rule ended in 
1962 but some opposition parties contended the voting was rigged 
and urged a boycott 
the main challenge to the national liberation front which has 
held sole power since this north african country gained its 
independence was expected to come from the fundamentalist islamic 
salvation front 
police were deployed throughout the country but there were no 
reports of violence 
authorities said the heavy police presence was to protect 
voters but they also feared violent street protests if the 
fundamentalists failed to win a majority 
other opposition parties looked for a low turnout among the 
countrys 13 million eligible voters as an indication of support 
for their boycott call 
they claimed the election was rigged in favor of the national 
liberation front because the ruling party controls nearly all the 
media has greater resources than other parties to help get out the 
vote and has its functionaries in the local government offices 
where the votes will be counted 
in all 11 parties were contesting the election which is to 
fill nearly 15000 seats on 1541 municipal councils and 48 
provincial councils 
elections for the national peoples assembly or parliament are 
not scheduled until 1993 but president chadli bendjedid could 
decide to advance the date for parliamentary elections depending on 
the outcome of the municipal voting 
until recently the national liberation front was the countrys 
only legal political party its candidates continue to enjoy access 
to state funds office space and the media although there have 
been official efforts to assist the new parties 
the national liberation front is an oldline marxist party born 
out of the algerian independence struggle it has abandoned its 
efforts to turn algeria into a oneparty socialist state although 
the front takes note of islam as a major tradition in algeria it 
has steered clear of fundamentalism 
the islamic salvation front the best organized among the new 
parties wants to establish the islamic legal code the sharia as 
law and openly opposes the democratic process 
we expect the people to give us 75 percent of the vote said 
islamic salvation front leader ali madani a philosophy teacher 
hundreds of university faculty members wrote a letter to 
algerian newspapers denouncing madanis remarks as a provocation 
some of the countrys most important opposition political groups 
were either barred from the elections or calling for a nationwide 
boycott the opposition covers a broad political spectrum 
including communists social democrats and conservatives 
the algerian popular party the national liberation fronts main 
rival during the independence struggle against france was among 
several parties refused official recognition by the government and 
barred from fielding candidates 
two other opposition parties the front of socialist forces and 
the movement for democracy in algeria chose not to run and instead 
called for an election boycott 
the movement for democracy is a leftist populist group headed by 
former president ahmed ben bella who was forced out of office by a 
military coup n 1965 and now lives in exile in switzerland 
the front of socialist forces is headed by berber leader ait 
ahmed a historic figure in the countrys liberation struggle it 
is a middleoftheroad group that places strong emphasis on 
preserving the berber language 
many algerian women have little say in the elections under the 
countrys islamic family code any man can vote on behalf of his 
wife or wives without producing a document authorizing him to do 
so 
the attitude of the 120000strong algerian military could prove 
decisive for the countrys political future 
the fundamentalists have called for the military to intervene to 
establish an islamic republic but senior army officers seem more 
likely to support a state free of religious interference

government and rebel leaders traveled 
to neighboring malawi today for their first direct peace talks 
aimed at ending a 13yearold civil war the national news agency 
reported 
afonso dhlakama commander of the mozambique national resistance 
known by its portuguese acronym renamo arrived in malawis capital 
blantyre the aim news agency said 
the delegation of the leftist government included transport 
minister armando guebaza and foreign minister pascoal mocumbi both 
members of the political bureau of the ruling frelimo party aim 
said 
by midday all the actors in the drama were present in 
blantyre although the talks had not yet begun aim said 
also in blantyre to mediate the talks were government officials 
from kenya and zimbabwe 
kenyan president daniel arap moi and president robert mugabe of 
zimbabwe arranged several indirect lowlevel meetings last year 
aimed at bringing the two sides to the negotiating table 
earlier today a spokesman for the guerrillas in lisbon 
portugal denied that renamo would hold talks in malawi 
we are prepared to meet anytime anywhere except malawi 
manuel frank told the independent tsf radio station in lisbon 
renamo had said it would prefer talks in kenya or portugal 
which ruled mozambique until 1975 
the war has claimed an estimated 600000 lives and turned the 
southeast african nation into one of the poorest countries in the 
world almost half of mozambiques 15 million people require food 
assistance and the annual per capita income is less than 200 
the rebels are active throughout mozambique waging hitandrun 
attacks on both military and civilian targets they have been 
accused of committing atrocities against civilians 
no government acknowledges supporting the rebels although south 
africa openly backed them in the early 1980s and the 
whiteminority government of rhodesia helped them until it became 
blackruled zimbabwe 
the rebels have demanded recognition by the government and free 
elections in mozambique but their political aims have never been 
clear 
chissanos government officially dropped its marxist label last 
year and has moved away from its socialistoriented economy toward 
a more marketoriented system in recent years 
the government has proposed a new constitution to allow 
elections in which independents could challenge candidates from 
chissanos ruling party the front for the liberation of 
mozambique however the government has refused to allow opposition 
parties 
the government receives most of its military aid from the soviet 
union but it also has developed good relations with the west in 
recent years the united states is the leading donor of food aid in 
mozambique

president bush said anew today that a united 
germany must belong to nato without conditions and not the 
associate membership suggested by soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
but bush at the outset of a meeting with republican 
congressional leaders said he stood ready to listen and discuss 
without rancor any ideas the soviets have for solving the 
dispute over the future of germany 
gorbachev suggested in a speech today to the supreme soviet 
legislature that he could accept a german associative 
participation in nato provided that there were no changes in the 
mutual obligations that east germany now has to the east bloc 
and west germany to nato gorbachev also said the two military 
alliances both must be transformed from their cold war status 
bush fielding a question from reporters indicated that the 
gorbachev proposal was not new but had come up during the 
superpower summit here two weeks ago 
our position is well known to him which is that a unified 
germany should be in nato with no conditions said the president 
who was observing his 66th birthday today but the more talking 
we do the more convinced i am that they will see that what were 
proposing is more stabilizing and is best for the soviet union as 
well as western europe and eastern europe 
so well keep on trying bush added but these ideas let 
them float them out there and well listen and well discuss them 
without rancor 
bush met monday with east germanys first noncommunist leader 
prime minister lothar de maiziere who said afterwards that nato 
must be significantly changed if soviet concerns about 
membership for a united germany are to be met 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the united states 
believes considerable progress has been made in persuading 
gorbachev that a unified germany inside the western alliance will 
not threaten soviet security or european peace 
i made clear to him what psychological difficulties this would 
signify de maiziere said after his oval office meeting with 
bush i made clear to him that it must be a significantly changed 
nato in order to be acceptable to our east european neighbors 
de maiziere said he and bush agreed that creating a new lasting 
and stable security order in europe is possible only if the role 
of the soviet union is written into it 
the prime minister added that membership in the north atlantic 
treaty organization for a united germany is only thinkable if a 
treaty clearly defines the status of soviet troops now stationed in 
east germany 
it remains open whether such a treaty should be between nato and 
the warsaw pact or between germany and the soviet union he said 
de maiziere said bush insisted that questions over such a treaty 
would have to be resolved by the countries negotiating the 
unification of east and west germany 
a white house statement said bush and de maiziere agreed that a 
united germany should enjoy full sovereignty from the time of its 
unification with no discriminatory constraints on its sovereignty 
and that germany should be free to choose its own alliance 
arrangements 
the march election of de maiziere chairman of the east german 
christian democratic union replaced a once rigidly communist 
regime he now heads a government rapidly moving to unify with west 
germany he was responsible for church affairs in the government of 
hans modrow the last communist leader 
fitzwater said bush stressed his belief that a united germanys 
membership in nato is essential for european security and will pose 
no threat to the soviet union 
gorbachev has said he is unwilling to accept continued german 
membership in nato on grounds it is a usled antisoviet 
military alliance he wants a united germany to belong to both the 
warsaw pact and nato 
but fitzwater said gorbachevs summit meeting with bush this 
month and later assurances offered by secretary of state james a 
baker iii may be helping to change gorbachevs mind 
its clear that this is going to be a gradual process i 
cant report any conclusion to the matter but we do feel progress 
is going to be made the spokesman said 
de maizierie said he took his reception by bush the first 
between an american president and an east german leader as an 
honor to the people of my country who won their freedom in a 
peaceful democratic revolution 
bush told white house visitors that the east german prime 
minister was clearly moved by his visit an event that would have 
been all but unthinkable at the height of the cold war 
he was so emotional about it he had never been here the 
president said describing his meeting with de maiziere as 
wonderful

the weather improved today and divers should be 
able to begin patching a 90foot gash in a cruise ship off cape 
cod the coast guard said 
cleanup crews had been waiting for calmer seas and clearer 
weather to unload thousands of gallons of diesel before repairs 
began but the coast guard said today the fuel would probably be 
left on board 
the weathers definitely better today said petty officer 
kelly king in boston the first thing on the agenda is to fully 
check the hull and patch it up 
about 7500 gallons of diesel fuel already had leaked from the 
617foot bermuda star which ran onto a rocky ledge sunday and 
some oil washed onto about five miles of a rocky shoreline of 
pristine naushon island the coast guard said 
about 100000 gallons of thick fuel remained on board exposed 
by a 90by2foot tear but pressure from seawater kept the oil 
inside while the vessel lay at anchor officials said 
if you moved the ship now the inertia of the sea would take 
away the balancing effect we have and it would suck the oil right 
out of the tear in the ship said coast guard spokesman steve 
aitkins 
repairs and unloading were called off monday because of rain 
fog winds of 15 to 30 mph and 2to4foot waves that endangered 
repair crews the coast guard said 
im not in any rush to hurry through that said cmdr larry 
doyle executive officer of the coast guards marine safety office 
in providence ri the vessel is stable its safe 
the fuel spilled so far threatens wildlife in buzzards bay 
including the worlds largest population of roseate terns a 
shorebird experts said 
the bermuda star was freed sunday nearly 13 hours after it 
strayed too close to shore and ran aground in dense fog on a cruise 
from new york to nova scotia 
sunday evening 680 passengers and about 380 crew members were 
taken off the ship by ferry 
there was a sudden stop and then a metallic noise then 
immediately there was an oily smell we went out on deck and we 
could see the oil coming out on the water said passenger paul 
kelly of columbia sc 
blood and urine tests were given to key members of the crew 
results were not immediately available 
david roddy senior vice president of bermuda star line cruises 
in teaneck nj said the ships captain hans lewing was an 
excellent skipper with 20 years of shipping experience 
lewing had been with the company for three years and had no 
record of problems roddy said

president bush turned 66 today and several 
reporters trooped into the cabinet room wearing childrens birthday 
hats in honor of the occasion 
they were rewarded with laughter and applause from bush and the 
republican congressional leaders he was meeting with the lawmakers 
had already burst into a chorus of happy birthday as the first 
wave of media entered the room 
its a vast improvement a smiling president told the 
reporters in the silly hats 
he then gave them a birthday present he waived his rule against 
answering questions at these socalled photo opportunities 
there was one catch 
only those wearing hats get their questions answered bush 
admonished the hatless reporters in the cabinet room 
bush said he did not know if soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev had sent him a birthday card but he added 
diplomatically ive got to be careful he may well have sent 
something 
he also fielded a query about the latest soviet suggestion on 
how to resolve eastwest differences over nato membership for a 
united germany 
bush was being feted with more ceremony tonight at a blacktie 
gop fundraising event in his honor the annual presidents dinner

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
today the bush administration accepts the fact that congress wont 
approve a ussoviet trade agreement until moscow loosens its grip 
on lithuania 
baker making his first appearance on capitol hill since the 
ussoviet summit ended june 3 said president bush has made this 
point to soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
we do not believe that congress will approve the commercial 
agreement until the deadlock over lithuania is broken baker told 
the senate foreign relations committee that is a fact of 
political life 
bush said he would not send the agreement to congress for 
approval until the soviet union passed a law granting free 
emigration to soviet jews and others but he did not link the trade 
pact to lithuania 
many members of congress promised to oppose the trade agreement 
until the soviet union ended its embargo against the breakaway 
baltic republic and participated in negotiations aimed at achieving 
lithuanian independence 
the agreement requires majority approval by both the house and 
senate 
baker said wide distances remain between the united states and 
the soviets regarding lithuania he said he wished he could report 
the two superpowers positions were close but they are not 
at the same time he said administration officials are 
encouraged that baltic leaders are in moscow for talks the 
administration hopes a systematic dialogue will lead to a 
peaceful resolution of the problem he said 
on other issues baker praised the recent multiparty elections 
in czechoslovakia in which prodemocracy groups received the 
plurality of the votes the big winner was democracy baker 
said 
but baker said the administration was reserving judgment on what 
happened in the bulgarian elections where the socialist party 
the former communists took almost half the vote 
questions about possible electionday abuses are being 
explored by government and party representatives baker said 
while baker said the summit provided solid underpinning for 
future ussoviet relations differences remain between the two 
superpowers 
specifically he criticized the soviets for continuing to 
support cuba 
we are still concerned about soviet support for cuba and 
cuban support for the rebels in el salvador he said continued 
soviet military assistance for cuba is a striking exception to the 
soviet unions new thinking on regional issues 
baker reiterated the us position that a unified germany should 
remain in nato he said he believes the soviet union eventually 
will come around to accepting this view the soviets now oppose 
giving a unified germany nato membership 
on arms control he said the administration has been heartened 
by recent soviet statements renewing a commitment to seek a rapid 
agreement on reducing conventional forces in europe 
overall baker said there will be aftershocks from the 
momentous changes in the world in 1989 there will also be great 
opportunities to create a more democratic more prosperous and more 
secure world he said

the embassy sources said the talks were to be held in the us

begin 
the talks were delayed monday when rebel sources said their 
delegation was taking a roundabout route to avoid the danger of 
attack 
both sides made concessions to permit the talks possible but 
the talks could be headed to an early impasse if rebels stick to 
their demand that liberian president samuel doe resign and leave 
the country before a ceasefire can be arranged in the

within 25 miles of the capital of monrovia his troops unable to

the insurgents 
the rebels had met little resistance until a week ago when 
government troops managed to retake the headquarters of the 
firestone rubber plantation 
doe who had refused negotiations with the rebels as long as 
taylor a former aide led them agreed to begin talks after his 
troops chased the rebels from the plantation rebels claim to have 
subsequently retaken the plantation but its american employees 
told their headquarters that it was not clear who was in control 
taylor had been insisting doe surrender before any negotiations 
could begin but accepted the appeal from church leaders to enter 
talks he said he would send a delegation to the talks but no 
ceasefire could be arranged until doe leaves liberia 
taylors delegation was believed to be headed by tom woewiyu 
who had been serving as the rebels spokesman

texas should prepare for oil spills the way 
california prepares for earthquakes a state official said as 
emergency crews braced for a possibly catastrophic spill from the 
mega borg burning in the gulf of mexico 
weve got some plans but theyre not capable of handling a 
gigantic spill andy mangan deputy land commissioner said 
monday 
the 886foot norwegian supertanker had been carrying 38 million 
gallons of light crude when explosions and fire crippled it 
saturday 
but at the time some of the needed equipment for oil containment 
and salvage was in europe equipment to spray flamechoking foam 
was in louisiana 
more powerful explosions hit sunday spilling blazing crude into 
the gulf and nudging the ship closer to sinking early today waves 
were breaking over the tankers deck officials estimated as much 
as 100000 gallons of oil had spilled 
on monday mangan and other state officials urged lawmakers to 
unify the states scattershot approach to dealing with spills he 
said the state should prepare for such disasters the way san 
francisco prepares for earthquakes 
the focus has not been there there hasnt been any concerted 
effort to put such a contingency plan together mangan said 
mangan said state officials have worked closely with alaska and 
other states since the exxon valdez spill the nations worst at 
nearly 11 million gallons 
he said texas probably is better prepared than some coastal 
states but not as well prepared as it could be 
in florida on monday gov bob martinez signed what he said is 
the nations most comprehensive law for preventing and cleaning up 
oil spills 
the law a compromise with oil shippers and retailers requires 
vessels and terminals to develop detailed spillresponse plans and 
terminals to buy spillcontainment equipment among other things 
it also raises liability limits for spill damage and cleanup costs 
for transporters and owners of cargo 
texas land commissioner garry mauro a member of the governors 
oil spill advisory committee agreed texas has some work to do he 
said texas ports handle 300 million tons of cargo each year 75 
percent of it oil products 
this is our worst nightmare mauro said were not ready 
to deal with a catastrophic oil spill off the coast 
the delayplagued cleanup effort bears out mauros words 
firefighters were hoping to start battling the blaze with foam 
on sunday but that tactic was pushed back because equipment to 
spray the foam had to be brought from louisiana said coast guard 
chief petty officer sam wilson 
other oil containment and salvage equipment was brought from as 
far away as holland the private companies responding to the mega 
borg fire had their equipment overseas because there are more 
offshore fires in the north sea and middle east than the gulf of 
mexico coast guard adm williams merlin said 
john sharp texas railroad commissioner and a member of the 
governors oil spill advisory committee said the exxon valdez 
accident in 1989 had prompted state efforts to try to better 
coordinate a plan 
when youre talking about a spill that is possible the size 
of an entire tanker im not sure you can make plans that are 
going to always adequately cover one that size or the size of a 
valdez sharp said 
what you have to do is make sure you do everything you can to 
ensure they dont happen to begin with 
other state officials said the response has gone well so far 
gov bill clements said the state is pulling out all the 
stops to prepare for a major spill 
he noted that there was a meeting monday of the state emergency 
management council which includes 27 state agencies and the red 
cross 
buck wynne chairman of the texas water commission said a 
recent drill that simulated a 200000gallon spill in the gulf 
helped prepare the state 
hopefully weve identified problems in coordinating a 
response to a major oil spill said wynne whose agency is part 
of a regional response team that also includes the coast guard and 
other federal agencies 
i think we are as ready as we can be

two environmental groups said today they had 
filed a federal lawsuit in south carolina to try to block the 
restart of a federal nuclear weapons plant closed more than two 
years ago for safety reasons 
the suit by the natural resources defense council and the energy 
research foundation was filed monday in us district court in 
columbia said daniel w reicher an attorney for nrdc 
the energy department which owns the savannah river site has 
said it intends to restart the first of savannah rivers three 
active reactors by next january the plant produces tritium gas for 
nuclear warheads 
the reactors were closed in 1988 after an accident at one 
facility raised troubling questions about safety standards and the 
risk of mechanical failures more than 1 billion is being spent to 
upgrade the reactors and retrain workers 
energy secretary james d watkins has said the timetable for 
restarting the plant is tentative but that putting the reactors 
back in production soon is vital to the nations security 
tritium decays at a rate of 55 percent a year so the 
quantities in warheads must be replenished the government says its 
stockpile of tritium is running low although information about 
tritium inventories is classified 
a secretary in the energy departments public affairs office 
said no one was immediately available to comment on the lawsuit 
reicher said the suit contends that the government should not be 
permitted to restart the k reactor at savannah river until it 
completes construction of a cooling tower for water discharged from 
the reactor into manmade lakes environmental groups contend the 
water at temperatures of up to 180 degrees interferes with fish 
migration and causes other environmental damage 
the cooling tower is scheduled for completion in 1992 
reicher said the department could remain in compliance with the 
federal water pollution control act of 1972 without finishing the 
cooling tower if president bush issued a waiver of the pollution 
requirements on national security grounds 
bush has given no indication of whether he would grant such a 
waiver 
the weapons plant whose reactors were built in the early 1950s 
is situated on a 315squaremile federal reservation near aiken 
sc along the savannah river

last summer rebecca donovan landed her dream 
job as head librarian for hazens three schools 
she had spent 12 years in nearby stanton as an english teacher 
who also ran the school library arranged the prom and sold popcorn 
at basketball games 
i was pregnant at the end of the night my feet would be 
swelled up like bowling balls she said recalling those grim 
days of being spread too thin 
but her joy was brief donovan 37 got laid off in april 
north dakota cut its education budget by more than 31 million 
this spring after voters rejected tax increases and some schools 
closed others cut out art music and home economics and more than 
300 teachers lost their contracts 
donovans hopes of getting her job back may rest with north 
dakotas voters who decide today whether to raise the sales tax 
from 5 percent to 6 percent for a year to bail out education by 
raising an estimated 42 million 
john conrad a retired businessman who has campaigned to raise 
the tax said voters reluctance to open their wallets wider has 
harmed education 
people have to look kids right square in the eye and say are 
these kids worth it he said conrad has billed his campaign a 
penny for our kids 
opponents said the schools will benefit by being forced to 
consolidate and share government spending they added is bloated 
and needs a crash diet 
state government has become a monster not a servant of the 
people says republican state sen bryce streibel the special 
interests want to have their way let the poor sucker whos out 
in the boondocks struggling along pay the bill 
voters rejected increases in income sales and gasoline taxes in 
december but showed the most sympathy for higher sales taxes with 
47 percent approving an increase 
kent french a businessman who led the drive last year against 
tax increases argued the state budget is big enough to provide for 
education if lawmakers want to provide more they should cut from 
other areas he said 
while no one wants education to suffer some necessary changes 
are being made french said because of the financial crunch 
north dakotans are taking a harder look at how their school boards 
manage their budgets he and others said 
wayne sanstead state superintendent of public instruction said 
teacher morale could take a dive if the measure is voted down 
i think the school administrators and the teachers are going 
to wonder where is the support that people talk about having 
he said 
the hazen district is cutting 400000 from its budget next 
year said superintendent ray frank 
hazen shed the equivalent of five teaching jobs reducing its 
music and library staffs and laying off a counselor the district 
also canceled plans to hire another sixthgrade teacher which 
probably means larger classes frank said 
donovan said she is troubled by the cuts especially when she 
looks at her young son who has shown talent at local art contests 
offerings such as music and art are the only things that separate 
us from the animals she said

president mikhail s gorbachev today proposed that 
a united germany could be an associate member of a transformed nato 
western diplomats said gorbachev in his hourlong speech to the 
supreme soviet legislature appeared to show more flexibility on 
the german question only days earlier he had reiterated soviet 
opposition to nato membership 
gorbachev also said the washington summit achieved huge 
results in arms control the speech broadcast live on soviet tv 
gave gorbachev the chance to highlight his area of greatest 
success foreign policy 
his domestic policy faces increasing criticism from citizens 
the country is beset with severe economic problems ethnic clashes 
and secessionist movements 
speaking calmly and smiling frequently gorbachev told the 
legislators that his warm reception in the united states and the 
signing of a ussoviet trade agreement were evidence of us 
faith in his domestic reform program 
gorbachev recounted his discussions at the washington summit 
with president bush on a united germany joining the north atlantic 
treat organization the western military alliance east germany is 
a member of the sovietled warsaw pact 
our position is thus we could agree to the joining if you 
accept associative participation the principle of blocs coming 
together in conjunction with the unification of germany in the 
process of which mutual obligations are not changed neither from 
the side of west or east germany and if simultaneously the blocs 
are reformed in natural connection with vienna and the alleuropean 
process 
gorbachev did not define his concept of associate membership for 
germany vienna is the site of talks on arms cuts and the 
europewide conference on security and cooperation aimed at 
reducing tensions 
bush asked by reporters in washington about gorbachevs speech 
today said a unified germany should be in nato with no 
conditions 
but bush said he stands ready to listen and discuss without 
rancor any ideas the soviets have for solving the dispute over 
the future of germany 
official radio moscow explained gorbachevs comments saying 
it might be possible to agree with germany being in nato as an 
associated member provided there are changes in the nature of the 
military alliances both nato and the warsaw treaty organization 
gorbachev appeared to be demanding that a united germany fulfill 
east germanys obligations to the warsaw pact only during a 
transition period when the function of the two military blocs 
would change 
a western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said 
gorbachevs comments appeared to signal positive movement on 
the german question but he said it was still unlikely gorbachevs 
position would be acceptable to the western allies without further 
modification 
previously the soviet union sought membership in both nato and 
the warsaw pact for a united germany 
a west german newspaper reported monday that at a meeting in 
washington east german prime minister lothar de maiziere would 
give bush a new proprosal from gorbachev to break the deadlock over 
germanys military allegiance 
the sueddeutsche zeitung said gorbachev would agree to nato 
membership for a united germany if the western alliance made a 
clear decision to transform itself into a political alliance 
speaking of the may 30june 3 summit with bush gorbachev said 
as a whole i think huge results were achieved in washington 
toward limiting nuclear and conventional weapons 
all this has great meaning he said another practical 
step was taken to realize the idea of a nonviolent nonnuclear 
world there is difficult work ahead but the danger of the cold 
war has begun to recede he said 
gorbachev and bush signed agreements to eliminate the two sides 
chemical weapons and to reach a final accord this year to cut 
sharply their strategic nuclear weapons 
speaking to the legislature gorbachev cited the trade bill he 
signed with bush as evidence that the american government indeed 
has faith in us

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
today the actions of the palestine liberation organization in the 
wake of an aborted terrorist attack on an israeli beach have been 
inadequate 
but he told the senate foreign relations committee the united 
states has not made any decision on whether to cut off dialogue 
with the plo because of the matter 
we want to weigh matters carefully and do so without the 
pressure of artificial deadlines said baker noting that 
suspending talks with the plo would have farreaching ramifications 
on future middle east peace efforts 
abu abbas a member of the plo executive committee claimed 
responsibility for the attempted seaborne attack 
while the plo has disassociated itself from the attack the 
groups top leaders have given no indication that they intend to 
take steps to discipline abu abbas and they have not condemned the 
attack directly baker said 
the united states has urged the plo to take such steps he said 
so far the plos public and private responses have fallen 
short of the mark baker said 
he said us allies such as britain have interceded with the 
plo asking the arab group to follow the united states advice 
over two dozen members of the senate have urged the bush 
administration to suspend the dialogue with the plo as a result of 
the attempted attack

a leftist terrorist group today claimed 
responsibility for a weekend rocket attack that damaged the offices 
of a us company 
the november 17 group said it launched the sunday attack against 
procter amp gamble co a household products manufacturer because it 
recently bought a debtridden company from the government at a low 
price 
we will automatically consider such a move as robbing the 
greek people and consequently we will strike without warning 
the group said in a letter to the socialist daily epikairotita 
authorities had already said they suspected november 17 in the 
attack on an office of cincinnatibased company the building 
located on a main thoroughfare was damaged but no one was injured 
officials said the attackers apparently used a stolen antitank 
missile and a small world war ii bazooka 
the conservative greek government elected in april says that it 
plans to privatize or liquidate most of the 70 former private 
companies operated by the state because they are losing about 1 
billion annually labor unions have protested the move 
procter amp gamble bought the property of a defunct greek company 
for 277 million at a public auction in may said gerassimos 
vassilatos a company spokesman the greek company had a total debt 
of 375 million he said 
eight previous auctions failed to provoke any interest from 
anybody else the price as a result was lowered by the court to a 
price that it considered appropriate he said 
he added that the greek company had laid off its work force two 
years ago and that the property would be used as a warehouse 
procter amp gamble has been in greece for 30 years and last year 
did 106 million in business vassilatos said 
november 17 has claimed the killings of 14 people since 1975 no 
member of the group has ever been arrested

the nuclear regulatory commission has 
proposed a 160000 fine against 3m co for failing to fully report 
radiation leaks from air guns filled with a radioactive chemical 
there were more leaking devices than they informed us of 
jan strasma an nrc spokesman in glen ellyn ill said monday 
the nrc cited 3m for placing the devices in unacceptable 
environments and failing to give adequate handling instructions 
to customers the citations were based on 1988 inspections by the 
federal agency 
mark fenner a 3m spokesman said the company will study the 
charges and respond within the allotted 30 days the manufacturer 
also has 30 days to pay or protest the fine 
we are surprised by the size of the proposed penalty fenner 
said 
the nrc ordered 3m in february 1988 to recall all 52000 of its 
air ionizers air guns that are used to change the electrical 
charges of atomic particles during manufacturing the ionizers are 
filled with polonium a radioactive substance 
by changing electrical charges the devices are able to 
eliminate static and dust in computer chips chemicals or in the 
air 
between 1500 and 2000 of the 3m ionizers were used by 
companies that make food beverages pharmaceuticals and cosmetics 
the nrc said monday it was unlikely that any consumer products were 
contaminated or that any handlers of the devices were exposed to 
significant radiation 
the agency said its inspection identified seven violations of 
its policies 
according to the nrc summary of the inspection 3m sales 
representatives willfully failed in some cases to perform 
evaluations to assure that customers would use static eliminators 
only in acceptable environments which would not cause leakage 
strasma said some sales were made to customers required to test 
for radiation leaks but not equipped to make the tests 
3m also failed to follow up with its customers after it 
determined that its air guns were leaking the nrc inspection 
summary said 
in addition nrc inspectors have accused 3m of failing to report 
to the nrc all results of tests performed on the ionizers for 1986 
and 1987 
fenner said the company would not respond publicly to the 
allegations until it reviews the case

congressional republicans emerged from the 
white house today waving the flag criticizing the supreme court 
and vowing to press for quick action on a constitutional amendment 
to restore special protection for the flag 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan holding a small flag in 
hand took a swipe at supreme court justice john paul stevens who 
warned in his dissent monday against leaders manipulating the flag 
for partisan disputes 
as far as i know hes never run for political office dole 
told reporters on the white house driveway if he wants to get 
out there and run well go right ahead he has a right to 
criticize those of us in politics and we have a right to criticize 
the court and theyre wrong 
were not manipulating were going to go out and tell the 
american people this is how people voted on this issue and then we 
can tell them how justice stevens voted in the court nobody would 
care said dole 
stevens was in the minority on the 54 decision that overturned 
the federal flag protection act in a dissent he wrote that the 
integrity of the flag as a national symbol has been compromised 
by those leaders who seem to advocate compulsory worship of the 
flag or manipulate the symbol of national purpose into a 
pretext for partisan disputes about meaner ends 
president bush was renewing his call for a constitutional 
amendment to protect the flag later today at a rose garden ceremony 
in which he was receiving a replica of the marines famed statue of 
the world war ii flagraising on iwo jima 
dole said the flag debate was very important to real people 
and the democrats should give us a very quick vote 
we dont need more hearings were ready to vote on flag 
day which is thursday dole said 
asked if he would question the patriotism of lawmakers who vote 
against the constitutional amendment dole said no but quipped 
i might make a 30second spot 
congressional democratic leaders strongly oppose amending the 
constitution to ban flag burning but votes were being scheduled 
around such symbolic days as the fourth of july and flag day june 
14 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash meanwhile said today he 
would not delay a house vote on a constitutional amendment and said 
it could come within two weeks but foley said he intended to vote 
against the proposal despite tradition that has the speaker 
refrain from voting 
i do not support amending the first amendment foley said 
flag burning isnt worth tampering with the most important 
repository of freedom any country has ever established in its 
history 
foley said republican efforts to use the vote as a political 
weapon against democrats who oppose the amendment will not succeed 
and that a vote against the amendment will not be one that leads 
to any political embarrassment 
rep don edwards dcalif chairman of the house judiciary 
subcommittee on the constitution and a leading house opponent of an 
amendment predicted an amendment would fail again 
im confident were going to get enough members to stand up 
and say no i love the bill of rights edwards said 
with flag burning no longer a federal crime since the courts 
action some said a vote for a constitutional ban would be 
politically irresistible just a few months before the fall 
congressional elections republicans hoped so 
certainly the vote on the constitutional amendment will become 
a campaign issue said ed rollins head of the house republican 
campaign committee 
its a good issue to define your opponent rollins said 
if your opponent is for flag burning hes got to go through a 
very sophisticated explanation of why he is 
democrats were aware of the political pitfalls the issue poses 
for them recalling how george bush exploited the flags patriotic 
values at michael dukakiss expense in his 1988 campaign 
it will be very tempting to play politics with it with the 
fourth of july said rep patricia schroeder dcolo a fierce 
opponent of a constitutional change 
democratic national chairman ron brown warned his potential 
candidates away from turning the fall campaign into a contest for 
patriotism he urged all democratic candidates not to seek any 
political gain by challenging their opponents patriotism or 
position on the flag amendment 
brown said the flag and bill of rights were more important 
than any political tug of war 
but some backers of a flagburning ban acknowledged public 
support for the issue may have dropped since the dispute was 
temporarily defused last fall with passage of the nowoverturned 
law 
i think candidly it will be a difficult vote said rep newt 
gingrich rga the house minority whip who backs a 
constitutional amendment its not going to happen 
automatically 
opponents of the amendment argue that the bill of rights and its 
first amendment protection of free speech are too sacred to tamper 
with because of a few dissenters who burn flags to gain publicity 
for themselves or their cause 
an amendment to prohibit burning the american flag would temper 
the first amendment by saying the right of free speech excluded 
burning the flag as a form of political expression the bill of 
rights comprising the first 10 amendments has never actually been 
amended 
the proposed amendment was scheduled for a vote next week in the 
house judiciary committee where chairman jack brooks dtexas 
supports it 
sen joseph biden ddel chairman of the senate judiciary 
committee and an author of the law said we are left with no 
other option but a constitutional amendment he said he would 
begin hearings and try to write an amendment that doesnt do 
violence to the first amendment 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine an opponent said he 
would move more slowly 
the issue is not the flag the issue is whether we are going 
to amend the bill of rights mitchell said 
to be added to the constitution the amendment needs twothirds 
majorities in both the senate and house and approval by 38 of the 
50 state legislatures

a group of families looking for a way to 
transport their children to a catholic school have collected nearly 
a million campbell soup co product labels needed to get a free van 
diana goebel whos heading the drive said monday that 994000 
labels had been collected fridays the deadline the group 
gathered 150000 labels in the campaigns first eight months and 
more than 764000 in the last four months 
the late rush of labels bordered on the miraculous goebel said 
it was like the loaves and fishes only they were campbells 
soup labels she said referring to the new testament story of 
jesus feeding 5000 men plus women and children with just five 
loaves of bread and two fish 
it just seemed like it was an impossibility goebel said of 
the groups efforts the way i figured it if the good lord 
wanted it to happen it will happen all we had to do was work 
hard 
and she did 
with more than 50000 labels a week pouring into her mailbox 
during the last couple of months goebel spent 15 hours a day 
clipping and packaging labels 
ive got blisters and calluses she said 
goebel said she received labels from more than 150 minnesota 
communities at least 35 states and from italy canada mexico 
asia and the bahamas the effort got a lift in february when it 
attracted national attention 
but the 15seat 20000 van wont solve their problem it will 
be too small for the 20 students who ride a rickety 1971 school 
bus instead the group plans to sell the van and use the money to 
buy a new or used 48passenger bus 
on friday goebel and her supporters from jordan a town of 
about 3000 people about 20 miles southwest of the twin cities 
plan to pack the labels into the old bus and travel 50 miles to a 
campbells office in monticello where the labels will be counted 
under campbells 18yearold labels for education program 
schools can redeem labels from campbells products for 
schoolrelated equipment during the last three years several 
schools nationwide have turned in enough labels to earn vans the 
company said

the disintegrating warsaw pact 
should be preserved in some form to prevent the soviet union from 
becoming dangerously isolated czechoslovakias foreign minister 
said tuesday 
the minister jiri dienstbier said the warsaw pact is moving 
away from its role as a military alliance but can still play a role 
in european affairs 
the warsaw pact led by the soviet union sent tanks into 
czechoslovakia to crush the 1968 prague spring reforms 
but now czechoslovakia wants to remain in the alliance so it can 
have a voice in negotiating disarmament and a new european security 
order dienstbier said 
for the first time the warsaw pact is useful to us he said 
in an interview with the associated press and two other news 
organizations 
the foreign minister was considered certain to keep his post in 
the new czechoslovak government being formed after weekend 
elections won by the prodemocracy forces that led last years 
revolution 
dienstbier recalling the isolation of germany following world 
war i said of the soviets we should do everything to pull them 
into europe 
we dont want to create any versailles complex in russia he 
said referring to the treaty that punished germany at the end of 
world war i its even more dangerous because they have all those 
nuclear arms 
the warsaw pact was created in 1955 and had always been 
dominated by the soviets until the dramatic changes that swept 
eastern europe last year 
pact members met in moscow last week and the soviets agreed 
that the other six member nations should have command of their own 
armies 
they had nominal command before but with the exception of 
romania refusal to join the 1968 invasion of czechoslovakia they 
had never exercised it the supreme military commander of the 
warsaw pact was always a top soviet general or marshal 
even the warsaw pact military command was not important 
dienstbier said it was just subordinated to the soviet army 
czechoslovakia east germany and poland want the conference on 
security and cooperation in europe to make its headquarters in 
prague the 35nation group includes the united states the soviet 
union canada and all of europe except albania 
under the threenation proposal a parallel center for arms 
control verification and confidencebuilding measures also would 
be established in berlin 
the three east european nations want their idea discussed at a 
meeting of the conference on security in vienna july 10 that 
meeting is to pave the way for a paris summit in december 
dienstbier and czechoslovak president vaclav havel have long 
advocated the eventual breakup of the warsaw pact and its western 
counterpart the north atlantic treaty organization 
unlike hungarys new leaders who want their country out of the 
pact dienstbier and havel say the east bloc alliance should break 
up only gradually meantime they want to remain members 
dienstbier said there are positive forces in the soviet 
union who want to work with czechoslovakia east germany and 
poland on transforming european security 
east german prime minister lothar de maiziere told president 
bush in washington monday that nato must be significantly 
changed to meet the soviet unions security concerns 
the west is insisting that a united germany be a member of nato 
moscow wants the new country to either be neutral or a member of 
nato and the warsaw pact 
de maiziere said a united germany would consider membership in 
nato only if a treaty clearly defined the status of soviet troops 
now stationed in east germany

president bushs term may mark the end of 
american industrial strength unless he adopts an economic policy 
that provides more assistance to develop new technologies a 
research group said tuesday 
rep mel levine dcalif chairman of rebuild america said the 
united states needs an industryled strategy with government 
cooperation and support to compete in the world market 
the next three years represent a critical turning point in 
economic history the group said in a report titled fiddling 
while us industry burns 
if president bush sides with the pragmatists america can 
remain a worldclass power for the foreseeable future the report 
said if he continues to allow the ideologues to dominate 
decisionmaking his term may mark the end of american industrial 
might 
rebuild america describes itself as a nonprofit bipartisan 
research group established to promote productive investment in 
people and industry 
the organization report was critical of bushs economic advisers 
chief of staff john sununu budget director richard darman and 
economic adviser michael boskin for what it called handsoff 
laissezfaire policies toward commercial ventures 
those policies it said have failed to produce sufficient 
commercial research and development close the investment gap with 
japan ensure continued us leadership in strategic industries 
protect the us manufacturing base and are keeping us the 
worlds largest debtor and increasingly dependent upon foreigners 
the report was written by lester thurow dean of the sloan 
school of management at the massachusetts institute of technology 
professor george lodge of harvard business school ed miller 
president of the national center for manufacturing sciences and 
rebuild america director fred branfman 
thurow who joined levine at a news conference the united 
states spends only onehalf as much per capita on plant and 
equipment as the japanese twothirds as much as the germans with 
those governments footing 50 percent of the research and 
development bill 
we have to spend equivalent amounts he said 
the administrations three proposals for closing the investment 
gap reduction of the federal budget deficit a capital gains tax 
cut and its family savings plan will do little to boost 
productive investment in the united states the report contended 
unless the administration changes its policies the report said 
the us could be a second or thirdrate industrial power in the 
year 2000 and president bush will be remembered as the herbert 
hoover of us industrial competitiveness 
hoover elected in 1928 was president during the stock market 
crash of 1929 and resulting collapse of the economy that led to the 
great depression

the senate ethics committee today opened two 
weeks of triallike hearings into the financial dealings of sen 
dave durenberger warning the minnesota republican that he could 
face strong sanctions 
the panel said earlier it found substantial credible 
evidence that the 12year senator broke senate rules and federal 
law in transactions involving his minneapolis condominium a book 
promotion deal and free limousine rides 
committee chairman sen howell heflin dala told durenberger 
today the committee had to answer two questions whether he 
violated senate rules or laws and whether his conduct had 
discredited the senate 
looking straight at durenberger heflin a former chief justice 
of the alabama supreme court said if the evidence clearly and 
convincingly leads me to the conclusion that you have violated the 
public trust i will not hesitate to recommend appropriate 
sanctions 
in opening its first hearings in nine years on charges that a 
senator abused his office committee members also promised 
durenberger they would not prejudge his case which the panel has 
spent more than a year investigating 
the theory expounded by some that the committee will because 
of the current political climate take harsh action against senator 
durenberger in order to prove that it is tough is ludicrous said 
committee vice chairman sen warren rudman rnh 
if the facts warrant the committee will recommend strong 
sanctions but if they do not we will not rudman said in 
opening remarks at the hearing 
durenberger sat between his attorney and an aide at a table 
facing committee members his back to around 100 onlookers and 
several tables full of reporters 
the committees special counsel robert bennett later opened 
his case by saying that durenberger knowingly and actively used 
a book promotion scheme to circumvent senate honoraria limits and 
divert 100000 in speaking fees into his own pocket 
this is unethical this is not honest said bennett who was 
expected to take most of the day laying out his case 
one of durenbergers four sons dan 22 asked his father during 
a hearing break how are you 
perfect his father replied 
bennett is familiar with the role of prosecutor having brought 
the case in 1981 against thensen harrison a williams jr 
dnj the last senator to face these kinds of hearings 
durenberger spent monday polishing an opening statement to the 
committee to give a context to the defense by his attorney 
said press secretary lois west 
the senator is represented by jim hamilton a former counsel to 
the senate watergate committee 
durenberger who has been silent on the case in recent days 
apologized to minnesotans last december for mistakes and lapses 
in judgment 
but the intense public scrutiny of his finances could spell the 
end of his career if voters in minnesota a state known for clean 
government arent satisfied with his defense 
many public radio stations in minnesota will broadcast the 
hearings live and television stations are planning heavy daily 
coverage 
people are concluding that something is seriously wrong 
said william luther the minneapolis attorney whose complaint 
initiated the senate investigation now its a matter of seeing 
if any kind of reasonable evidence or defense is presented 
durenberger does not have to run for reelection until 1994 but 
opinion polls indicate a majority of minnesotans think he should 
resign if the committee finds serious violations 
the sixmember ethics committee is made up equally of 
republicans and democrats it will decide after the hearings 
whether its allegations are true and then recommend a punishment to 
the full senate ranging from a mild reprimand to expulsion 
bennett recommended removing williams from the senate after the 
1981 hearings but he resigned before his colleagues had to vote on 
ousting him the ethics committee began its investigation after 
williams had already been convicted in federal court in the abscam 
bribery case 
the committee began investigating durenberger early last year 
and brought charges against him in february and again in may 
the first set of allegations focused on the book contract 
durenberger used to earn 100000 in speaking fees in 1985 and 1986 
for promoting two books he wrote on defense and health issues 
in may the panel charged that durenberger abused his office and 
misused public funds in a pattern of improper conduct involving 
his minneapolis condominium 
durenberger has acknowledged that he tried to cut the cost of 
maintaining homes in washington and minnesota by claiming senate 
reimbursement for nights he stayed in the condominium

manslaughter in the strangulation death of a pregnant woman with 
whom he purportedly was having an affair 
pike circuit judge bayard collier sentenced the agent mark 
putnam to 16 years in prison after putnam accepted a plea bargain 
and pleaded guilty to killing susan daniels smith 28 of freeburn

when she was serving as an fbi informant

explosions felt up to 30 miles away 
leveled a small fireworks plant today killing two people 
authorities said 
an hour after the first explosion at 9 am witnesses said 
there were still minor explosions at the midsouth fireworks plant 
located six miles southeast of this eastcentral mississippi town 
we have not found the bodies yet but we are sure there are 
two don harris of the lowndes county medical examiners office 
said at late morning we have just now been able to put water to 
it 
he said two people were injured suzy powers a spokesman for 
the golden triangle regional medical center in columbus said one 
person had been brought in with fairly minor injuries 
the plant usually employees about 20 but that increases to 
about 35 this time of the year but at the time of the explosion 
only four people were believed to be in the plant witnesses said 
the old brick school that housed the plant is down to the 
ground harris said 
there was one small explosion then a real big one said ed 
markham of ekanobel inc a chemical plant about four miles from 
the fireworks factory after the first one i thought it was a 
sonic boom from a plane then the second one went off and i knew it 
was something big

survived the initial blasts and that officials were trying to move 
it to a safe area away from the plant

consumers privacy rights are not violated 
when businesses share their credit records banking and retail 
officials said tuesday in opposing legislation to restrict the 
practice 
in fact consumers benefit from quick availability of credit and 
directmail sales they otherwise might not hear about william 
bloom of the national retail federation told a house subcommittee 
that is considering revisions to the 20yearold fair credit 
reporting act 
but other witnesses told the panel the law should be changed so 
that consumers not private credit reporting agencies control 
access to their credit records 
credit records are more than just account numbers they are a 
consumers reputation rep matthew rinaldo rnj told the 
house banking subcommittee on consumer affairs 
since credit bureaus make huge profits by finding new ways to 
sell personal credit records they have shown no interest in 
seriously protecting a consumers privacy rinaldo said 
the chairman of the subcommittee rep richard lehman dcalif 
proposes allowing credit reporting bureaus to release customer 
records to solicitors and other companies only if the consumers 
have a chance to bar such action 
rinaldo would go further his proposal would allow credit 
reports to be provided only for transactions initiated by consumers 
not for such things as directmail marketing or preapproved 
lines of credit 
in a third proposal rep charles schumer dny would allow 
credit files to be released only with consumers consent and only 
to companies seeking new customers by offering them credit 
bloom vice president of saks fifth avenue defended the sharing 
of customers credit records through credit reporting bureaus 
the practice is innocent in its operation and the benefits to 
both creditors and consumers are real bloom said consumers get 
quicker credit and direct mailings help new businesses enter a 
local marketplace he said 
a proposal to allow the federal trade commission to impose civil 
penalties against those who misuse credit records should be dropped 
because enough penalties already exist contended alan heuer of 
marine midland bank representing the consumer bankers association 
and the american bankers association 
jean noonan associate director of the federal trade 
commissions bureau of consumer protection said that although 
there is a danger that use of credit reports can be an invasion of 
privacy her office would rather regulate it than ban it 
and rep john hiler rind ranking minority member of the 
subcommittee said the proposals to restrict the credit reporting 
law go too far 
we also have to be concerned that we do not shut off the flow 
of credit to all but the most goldplated credit risks hiler 
said 
bonnie guiton director of the us office of consumer affairs 
said most consumers are concerned about how much information is 
known about them by private business she noted that industry 
estimates the error rate in credit records could be as high as 40 
percent 
but she opposed proposals to require credit reporting companies 
to provide customers a free annual copy of their credit record the 
consumers will end up paying the cost she said adding that credit 
companies instead should have to conduct random checks on their own 
work and publish the results 
the various proposals include language to give consumers new 
power to correct errors in their credit reports and require that 
they be notified when their credit report is used to deny them a 
transaction

japan said tuesday it is willing to resume loans to 
peru if the south american nations new government shows 
willingness to deal with its serious economic and social problems 
the japanese ancestry of perus new president alberto fujimori 
has raised hopes of greater access to japanese aid fujimori said 
monday he hoped to visit tokyo before his scheduled july 28 
inauguration 
fujimoris victory over mario vargas llosa in perus 
presidential runoff election sunday was the top story in many 
japanese newspapers foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe 
extended the governments heartfelt congratulations to fujimori 
he noted that fujimori would be the first ethnic japanese to 
head a foreign government 
but at the same time the diplomacy and the relations between 
the two countries should not be swayed by such factors watanabe 
said 
peru was the largest recipient of japanese aid in latin america 
in cumulative terms until 1988 but dropped to fourthlargest after 
it defaulted on payments and japan cut off its yen credits 
fujimori faces widespread unemployment a 2000 percent 
inflation rate terrorism and extensive drug trafficking 
despite perus previous default if there is a willingness to 
cope and overcome those problems and explain to us in concrete 
manner what means they will take and if we are satisfied yes 
there is always a possibility of more loans watanabe told a news 
briefing 
peru reportedly estimates its current worldwide medium and 
longterm debt both public and private at about 152 billion 
one foreign ministry official speaking on condition of 
anonymity estimated peru owes japan 1 billion in government and 
private debts 
the ministry said japanese government credits to peru have 
totaled 359 million since 1971 the last outlay was in 1983 313 
million for fishing port construction it said 
watanabe said the japanese government is aware of reports that 
fujimori wants to visit japan but had not received any official 
notification if fujimori indicates he wants to visit we would 
welcome him and would like to arrange meetings with those people he 
wants to meet he said 
fujimori 51 is the eldest son of japanese emigrants who 
traveled to peru from japans southern island of kyushu in 1934 in 
lima they opened an upholstery shop that failed during a boycott 
of japanese businesses during world war ii 
fujimori earned a degree in agricultural engineering and became 
a school administrator 
japanese emigration peaked in the decades before and after world 
war ii but has always been relatively small japanese settlers 
never have exceeded 1 percent of the population of their host 
countries 
brazil was the principal destination of japanese settlers in 
north and south america in the prewar years followed by the united 
states canada and peru 
in recent years japans prosperity and stability have 
discouraged further emigration last year only 3851 japanese 
settled in other countries the foreign ministry says

eskimo and indian groups as well as 
alaska officials say two recent court decisions undermine a federal 
law meant to guarantee tribal rights in adoption cases 
the alaska supreme court in december and a southern california 
superior court judge in february ruled that tribes have no right to 
intervene in adoption proceedings involving eskimo or indian 
children if the mother gives up the child voluntarily 
representatives of indian and eskimo rights groups in alaska and 
the lower 48 have criticized the rulings saying they violate the 
intent of the indian child welfare act 
essentially the alaska supreme court has sanctioned a 
loophole in the federal law said lloyd miller a lawyer for the 
anchoragebased cook inlet tribal council 
the tribal council earlier this year appealed the state supreme 
courts decision to the us supreme court but the panel declined 
to hear the appeal 
the indian child welfare act was enacted by congress in 1978 
after it reviewed evidence that up to 50 percent of some tribes 
children nationally had been put up for adoption 
congress agreed with indian advocates that adoption of indian 
children by nonindian parents was threatening the integrity of 
tribal groups and that such adoptions can cause longterm soct tribal council 
wasnt notified the mother later changed her 
mind and sought the councils assistance to recover her child 
if the birth parent asks to remain anonymous in other words 
chooses not to have the tribe notified we believe the mothers 
right to privacy supersedes the tribes right to be notified 
said jim caldarola executive director of catholic social services 
the states largest private adoption agency 
but indian groups contend the indian child welfare act was meant 
to protect the childs rights not the mothers 
the second case involves an aleut girl from the kodiak island 
village of akhiok her 19yearold mother from cypress calif 
decided to give up her child to a nonaleut couple in canada but 
akhiok village leaders learned of the case and want the child back 
were trying to get the baby out of canada and back down here 
to our community said akhiok tribal council president david 
eluska too many of our tribal members in the past have been 
adopted out and we have no idea or inkling where they ended up 
state tribal officials and indian advocates believe that when 
children are not adopted by their own people they are removed from 
their ancestral heritage and thrust into a sort of cultural and 
ethnic limbo 
from 1985 through 1987 the last year for which statistics are 
available 474 eskimo and indian children were adopted according 
to the alaska bureau of vital statistics ninetytwo were adopted 
by couples who were neither eskimo nor indian 
state officials agree the notification issue creates a loophole 
in federal law 
the states position is that the notice should be required 
said myra munson commissioner of the state department of health 
and social services we believe it the federal law should be 
amended 
indian advocates have said the court cases are important not 
just to alaska but to the entire country 
its of a great deal of importance nationally said jack 
trope a lawyer with the new yorkbased association of american 
indian affairs a nonprofit legal aid and advocacy group concerned 
about indian issues 
up until very recently the tribes were certain under the act 
that they had the right to intervene trope said 
the recent case indicated that the right to intervention is 
not as clear cut in the act as everyone thought thats of great 
concern 
trope predicts legal battles across the country to clarify the 
law 
well certainly be looking to fight these things in the court 
system he said the law is on our side notwithstanding what 
the alaska supreme court says

a fast food restaurant chain is voluntarily 
recalling 300000 sports water bottles because the mouthpiece can 
present a choking hazard to children 
taco bell corp of irvine calif began last monday offering 
the bottles for 99 cents to customers who made food purchases at 
its 2700 stores nationwide but the promotional campaign was 
suspended three days laer after the company received a report 
from a customer that his 21monthold child had dismantled the 
bottles mouthpiece and attempted to swallow it the consumer 
product safety commission said 
when a cpsc inspector tried to purchase a bottle last friday he 
was told store managers had been instructed to pack them up and 
ship them back the day before the agency said in a written 
statement 
its the fastest work on a recall ive ever seen said cpsc 
spokesman dan rumelt 
consumers should return the bottles to the taco bell where 
purchased for a full refund 
more than 20 million of the water bottles which have become a 
popular fixture among sports enthusiasts have been marketed in the 
last ten years by specialized bicycle components of morganhill 
calif according to company president mike sinyard 
specialized has redesigned the bottles and plans to ship them to 
customers like taco bell by june 25 he said 
the company also will replace mouthpieces on all other bottles

the coast guard also backed away from earlier reports that the 
886foot tanker had begun buckling because of the intense heat the 
shifting cargo and the contiuous stream of water being poured on 
the vessel 
there is no evidence at all of any structural damage said 
coast guard chief petty officer gene maestas 
he said crews on the scene 57 miles southeast of galveston 
reported no signs of damage 
the norwegian tanker was transferring some of its cargo of 38 
million gallons of oil to a smaller tanker when the first 
explosions occurred two of the 41 crew members were killed and two 
are missing and presumed dead 
on monday the coast guard said there was a slightly increased 
chance the ship would sink because waves were washing over the back 
end 
the coast guard said today they believed less than 2000 gallons 
of light crude remained in the water the rest of the up to 100000 
gallons believed spilled since saturday had either dissipated or 
burned off officials said 
as a precaution the us government asked mexico to send oil 
skimmers to help with cleanup operations if the situation worsens 
were in the planning stages for what may be a catastrophic 
incident said maestas 
the rear of the mega borg has dropped more than 60 feet since 
the norwegian tanker was crippled early saturday by explosions and 
fire the drop indicated either that the cargo had shifted or the 
ship was taking on water officials said 
the dropping stern increases the danger of sinking but only 
incrementally coast guard chief petty officer todd nelson said 
we are not talking right now about sinking 
rear adm william kime commandant of the coast guard flew over 
the crippled ship and said that despite the setbacks were 
cautiously optimistic 
however bob schuller a naval architect in houston said the 
dropping added pressure on the ships structure he said he did not 
know the extent of damage but speculated the pressure could crack 
the ship or sink it 
the mega borg carries more than three times as much oil as was 
spilled by the exxon valdez off alaska in march 1989 in the 
nations worst oil spill 
authorities however noted the oil spilled in alaska was heavy 
crude which doesnt dissipate nearly as rapidly as the light crude 
aboard the mega borg also much of the oil spilling off texas was 
being consumed by fire 
currents and winds were expected to push the oil toward a 
200mile stretch of coast between freeport and corpus christi but 
the coast guard said the currents were expected to keep the spill 
from coming ashore 
gary clark houston audubon society president said the coast is 
probably the most sensitive breeding bird area in the united 
states and that a huge spill would come at the worst time the 
height of the breeding season for many birds 
the tanker operated by mosvolds shipping of farsund norway 
was bound from palanca angola it was scheduled to travel to aruba 
after galveston 
elf a houstonbased oil distributor that was going to market 
the tankers cargo is paying an undetermined amount for the 
cleanup 
texas officials meanwhile urged lawmakers to better prepare 
the big oilproducing state for spills by unifying the states 
approach to prevention and planning 
the focus has not been there there hasnt been any concerted 
effort to put such a contingency plan together said andy mangan 
the states deputy land commissioner

west rib ito became too sick to continue and stayed behind while 
his companions went on and apparently made it to the top quinley

mikhail s gorbachev met the presidents of all 
three baltic republics today the first time since the soviet 
president called their steps toward independence illegal 
the leaders held an exchange of opinions on the situation in 
interethnic relations reported vremya the governments nightly 
tv news without giving further details 
vremyas reference to ethnic relations apparently referred to 
reports that the independence moves in the baltic republics have 
heightened tensions between russianspeaking residents and the 
native populations 
the meeting appeared to mark a new stage in the diplomatic 
effort to end the impasse that began when lithuania declared 
independence in march latvia and estonia followed with resolutions 
setting transition periods to independence 
before the meeting lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis 
sounded upbeat about seeing gorbachev 
constructive dialogue is on the way landsbergis said upon 
arrival at the lithuanian mission in moscow he earlier held a 
40minute meeting with presidents anatoly gorbunov of latvia and 
arnold ruutel of estonia at the latvian mission 
gorbachev in a report to the supreme soviet parliament on his 
washington summit did not mention todays meeting 
he acknowledged that some americans oppose senate ratification 
of a ussoviet trade agreement signed during the summit until 
moscow grants independence to the group of lithuanian separatists 
but after i had contacts with the american people it turned 
out that such demands do not reflect the position of the entire 
united states gorbachev told parliament 
gorbachev also held a meeting with the presidents of all 15 
soviet republics and told them it was time to get down to 
practical work on revamping the soviet federation vremya reported 
the meeting included the baltic presidents and boris n yeltsin 
president of the russian republic which deepened gorbachevs 
problems today by passing a declaration of sovereignty although a 
nonbinding one 
during his parliamentary address gorbachev did not mention that 
president bush said he would not implement the trade deal until the 
soviet parliament gives final endorsement to a law liberalizing 
soviet emigration policies 
although soviet jews and other ethnic groups are leaving in 
record numbers parliament last week adopted an agenda that delays 
until at least september final consideration of the law which it 
has given preliminary approval 
reports from washington inddents formed a united front last month to 
press their drives to restore the independence they lost 50 years 
ago when forcibly annexed the leaders had asked for a meeting with 
gorbachev 
estonia and latvia have taken a more cautious path than 
lithuania tentatively declaring independence but setting no date 
for their secession 
gorbachev embargoed all oil most natural gas and other raw 
materials shipments to lithuania on april 18 to press the republic 
to rescind proindependence laws lithuania has said since then 
that it is willing to negotiate on rolling back those laws but 
steadfastly refuses to revoke its declaration of independence

reform for years to come 
he said it was a mistake to focus almost exclusively on present 
teachers 
both older and younger teachers have to be considered but if 
i were to draw a conclusion id say we have been far too 
neglectful of educating the new generation of teachers who will be 
determining where schools will be going in the first quarter of the 
21st century said boyer in a recent interview 
darlinghammond added its generally easier to train a new 
teacher in reform techniques such as team teaching than it is to 
persuade a veteran teacher to break longcherished classroom habits 
some teacher colleges have begun to address these problems the 
holmes group a coalition of about 100 education schools 
interested in reform is fostering programs allowing student 
teachers to practice new techniques in public school classrooms 
several such programs have started recently in michigan for 
example 
the rise in the average age of teachers during the last two 
decades mirrors declining student enrollments and tight state 
school budgets those trends have been most pronounced in the 
midwest and northeast 
not all states keep teacher age data but a check of state 
departments of education and local union affiliates found the 
average age of teachers in connecticut for example is 433 in 
georgia 42 indiana 42 michigan 44 maryland 411 and new 
jersey 425 
the median age in new york was 424 as the 198889 school year 
and 251 percent of the teaching force is 49 or older 
in massachusetts suffering the effects of a decadeold tax 
revolt measure and a worsening budget crisis the average age is 47 
by contrast teachers in new mexico a sunbelt state with a 
growing student population average 377 
reformers concerned over average age emphasize they dont mean 
to belittle the skills of veteran teachers 
more experienced teachers are more productive they just wont 
make the mistakes a younger teacher would said gould 
nonetheless the age statistics lend urgency to the need to 
update the skills of veteran teachers and create more collegial 
environments in public schools said darlinghammond 
by and large teacher effectiveness increases during the first 
five to seven years of a career then levels off and may even 
decline whether that happens depends on the school environment 
collegial environments that have lots of opportunities to develop 
and learn help foster professional growth but thats not 
typical she said 
educators believe that school improvement is most likely to take 
root in schools with a balanced mix of young and old teachers 
from what i see whether or not a person is willing to take a 
look at innovative ideas has little to do with age said keith 
geiger president of the national education association i hear 
as many innovative ideas from 50 yearolds as 25 yearolds 
but statistics suggest that the balance has swung toward a 
heavier concentration of veteran teachers many of whom have seen 
reform waves come and go with little apparent effect and may be 
viewing current reform efforts skeptically 
i think all teachers want to be part of exciting changes 
boyer said but we have to ask which teachers will be prepared 
to harness technology will they be prepared to deal with an 
increasingly bilingual population will they be prepared to be 
creative and not just conforming

communist parties in eastern 
europe have shown surprising staying power in the regions first 
free elections in four decades 
in bulgaria and romania former communists won elections 
in poland hungary east germany and czechoslovakia the 
communist ideologoy has been largely dismissed by voters and 
replaced by reformers 
but even in czechoslovakia where over the weekend president 
vaclav havels civic forum was the big winner communists 
demonstrated a surprising core of power 
i did underestimate the communists i would give them 
something like 8 percent of the vote said jan urban leader of 
civic forum who watched the communists get 137 percent of the 
vote 
after the swift fall of a series of communist governments in 
central europe last year the communist successes in free elections 
were not widely expected 
in czechoslovakia many attributed the communist vote to the 
countrys relatively high standard of living in the east bloc and a 
long leftist tradition but another reason seemed to be a fear of 
persecution on the part of many who were members of the old regime 
i am convinced that the anticommunist campaign and the 
demands to ban the communist party contributed to the fact that 
people who are still communist party members or ho recently left 
the party were afraid said petr uhl veteran dissident and civic 
forum member 
they feared for their existence and their future and that 
brought them together uhl said but he added that in spite of 
their limited success it was a party of the past 
in east germany czechoslovakia hungary and poland communists 
are virtually excluded from the new governments and expect to act 
as a parliamentary opposition 
in romania reform communists instrumental in the ouster of 
dictator nicolae ceausescu defeated a badly organized opposition 
led by figures who had been in exile for years bulgaria probably 
the soviet unions closest ally in the east bloc also voted in a 
government of reform communists 
communists in all the countries may profit from the hardships 
during the regions transition to a market economy 
this is the end of the euphoria of slogans the time when 
according to some it was enough to badmouth the communists said 
ladislav adamec czechoslovakias communist leader 
he expressed hope that things could swing the communists way 
again 
it is probable that a new regrouping of political forces will 
take place and that means new opportunities for us he said 
but the problems of his party are great about 700000 members 
have left the communist party since december 1989 mostly younger 
people who joined after 1981 that leaves a high percentage of 
older more orthodox members whose political future seems limited 
communists will not be permitted to join the new coalition 
government and the aging party membership seems unlikely to produce 
dynamic parliamentary politicians 
the czechoslovak communist party relinquished power under the 
pressure of a revolution in contrast the polish and hungarian 
parties were in the vanguard of reform pushing their countries 
toward a more liberal system 
many people recognize that imre pozsgay a leading reformer in 
the hungarian communist party played an important role in 
dismantling the oneparty system in that nation 
yet despite the partys pioneering role in east european reform 
it only won just over 10 percent of the vote in elections held in 
march and april 
the polish communist party tried to distance itself from its 
past by adopting the name social democracy of the republic of 
poland nonetheless as local elections in the country showed 
recently the solidarity labor movement has virtually wiped out the 
former communists as a political force 
there are still several former communist ministers in the 
cabinet however under last augusts agreement between solidarity 
and the communists

taxis bus shelters even the citys famed 
cable cars are displaying advertisements for namebrand condoms as 
part of a bold move to expand condom advertising 
schmid laboratories the worlds largest condom manufacturer 
took the step because while the awareness of the aids problem is 
very high behavior changes are not as great as anyone would like 
to have it company president don falk said monday 
city officials agreed the time has come for condom advertising 
unlike previous ad campaigns for condoms that took a public 
service approach the new outdoor campaign tries to reach a broader 
audience by encouraging general condom use 
the ads which began appearing on 75 taxis 10 cable cars and 23 
bus shelters on monday show a box of condoms on a white 
background black lettering on the ads say 
for extra protection ramses condoms 
the company coordinating the bus shelter campaign also supports 
the ads the ads look good and there was never any question of 
not putting them up said lou lillian vice presidentgeneral 
manager of gannett outdoor advertising 
the aids epidemic shifted the focus of condom advertising from 
contraception to aids prevention falk said but now the campaign 
strategy is shifting back somewhat 
falk conceded that the aids crisis opened doors for condom 
manufacturers by expanding the market and increasing the publics 
tolerance for open peddling of the product 
recent advertising stunts have included flying a plane over fort 
lauderdale beach fla and padre island in texas during spring 
break with a banner that read play safe with ramses extra a 
similar tactic was used at the indianapolis 500 
the san francisco project will last two months schmid will 
evaluate the campaigns effectiveness by tracking sales and 
conducting surveys 
coordinating the projects release with the upcoming sixth 
international conference on aids was aimed at reaching a receptive 
audience we thought the timing would be perfect falk said 
the campaign would reach not only people in san francisco who 
would be interested in condoms but 10000 to 12000 people from 
all over the world who would be interested 
i fully expect that if the project is a success we would 
repeat and expand it

the deficit in the broadest measure of us 
trade shrank to a sixyear low of 2294 billion during the first 
three months of the year the government reported tuesday but 
analysts cautioned that the good news may be temporary 
the commerce department credited a record level of american 
merchandise exports increased spending by foreign tourists and 
higher us investment earnings for the 14 percent improvement in 
the current account deficit compared to the fourth quarter when 
the deficit had been 2669 billion 
the current account also known as the balance of payments is 
the most closely watched trade statistic because it measures not 
only trade in merchandise but also trade in services and investment 
flows between countries 
the first quarter deficit was the smallest since a 205 billion 
gap in the first three months of 1984 but analysts cautioned that 
special factors had skewed the new figure and that the us trade 
performance is likely to deteriorate in coming months 
david wyss chief financial economist for drimcgraw hill said 
that 3 billion in first quarter export growth came from backlogged 
shipments at boeing co which had curtailed shipments during a 
strike late last year he predicted the overall deficit for all of 
1990 would total 108 billion essentially unchanged from the 
11003 billion for 1989 
the first quarter was a bit of a false dawn wyss said 
even with the quarters improvement the united states is 
beginning the 1990s in a far different position from the beginning 
of the 1980s a decade ago america was the largest creditor 
nation it ran surpluses in its current account as the earnings on 
overseas investments were enough to offset perennial deficits in 
merchandise trade 
but as americans handed over billions of dollars to foreigners 
in payments for imported cars and televisions the investment 
cushion eroded it disappeared altogether in 1985 when the united 
states became a net debtor for the first time in 71 years 
that means foreigners now own more in us assets than americans 
own overseas a development that has led some to say the united 
states is losing control over its economic destiny 
tuesdays report indicates americas debtor position has now 
risen to around 670 billion although the governments official 
accounting of the gap between us holdings and foreign investments 
will not be released for several more weeks 
brad larschan an attorney with the association for 
international investment a lobbying group for foreign companies 
doing business in the united states said there was a growing push 
in congress to restrict foreign investment which he termed an 
unfortunate development given americas continued need to 
finance the shortfall in its current account position with foreign 
borrowing 
for the first three months of the year the merchandise trade 
deficit narrowed by 82 percent to 2637 billion as an alltime 
high in us export sales offset the highest volume of oil imports 
in more than 12 years 
the surplus in the investment category rose by 83 percent to 
608 million while the surplus in the services category which 
covers such things as foreign tourist spending in the united states 
and banking and insurance earnings by us companies operating 
overseas rose 31 percent to 631 billion 
the fourth category in the current account unilateral 
transfers covers us foreign aid payments and pension benefits 
paid to americans living overseas it shrank by 25 percent to 349 
billion in the first quarter

sen alan cranston dcalif urged a senate 
subcommittee tuesday to stop the national park service from a land 
deal that would allow commercial development of pristine southern 
california land owned by comedian bob hope 
under the arrangement hope would give the national park service 
864 acres in the china flat area of jordan ranch in exchange for 59 
acres of national park land in cheeseboro canyon 
hope is selling other land in the area to developers of a golf 
course and luxury housing who need the 59 acres that now belongs to 
the government to reach hopes property 
as part of the arrangement the developers have agreed to pay 
the park service up to 1 million to build a new visitor center for 
the santa monica mountains national recreation area and give the 
service all revenues from a parking concession at golf tournaments 
on the jordan ranch 
hope also has agreed to sell 4772 acres in the santa monica 
mountains to the santa monica mountains conservancy a state 
agency to be preserved for public park and recreational use 
cranston call the deal troubling 
jordan ranch has repeatedly been identified for federal 
acquisition as part of the santa monica mountains national 
recreation area cranston told the senate appropriations interior 
subcommittee the park service should be seeking to acquire that 
property and to protect the resources of jordan ranch 
cranston described the ranch as 2308 acres of pristine canyon 
lands and said the property supports an abundant bird population 
i am dismayed that the national park service is opening the 
door to commercial development of what one day should be national 
parkland said cranston in my judgment they are acting 
directly contrary to the mission of the park service

pumping iron in the geriatric set does not 
necessarily mean gulping down geritol 
researchers say that giving frail 90yearolds a regimen of 
highintensity weighttraining can dramatically increase their 
muscle strength and may help them avoid accidents associated with 
weak muscles 
the findings reported in wednesdays journal of the american 
medical association are based on a study of 10 residents of a 
boston nursing home ages 86 to 96 
our findings suggest that a portion of the muscle weakness 
attributed to aging may be modifiable through exercise wrote the 
researchers who were led by dr maria fiatarone of the us 
department of agricultures human nutrition research center on 
aging at tufts university in boston 
because muscle strength decreases by perhaps 30 percent to 40 
percent during the course of the adult life span it is likely that 
at the end of training these subjects were stronger than they had 
been many years previously the researchers wrote 
they called it the first study to examine the effects of 
weighttraining in such an old population 
but kim herling who works with the elderly as director of 
cardiovascular rehabilitation at the university of chicago medical 
center said the number of subjects in the study was too small to 
apply to the general population 
the last thing youd want to have happen is have a group of 
60 to 90yearold people going out and weightlifting because of 
the risk of injury ms herling said she said elderly people who 
want to lift weights should consult a physician 
during the study conducted in the summer of 1988 six women and 
four men participated in an eightweek weighttraining program that 
focused on the quadriceps muscle at the front of the thigh 
three times a week for eight weeks the subjects performed leg 
lifts with weights for about 45 minutes a session 
by the end of the eightweek training period the nine subjects 
who completed the study had at least doubled the amount of weight 
they could lift and some had tripled and quadrupled that amount 
said ms fiatarone 
the average increase in singleleg exercises went from 16 pounds 
at the beginning to about 42 pounds by the end of the training she 
said 
one 86yearold man stopped after four weeks because of pain at 
the site of a previous hernia the rest completed the training with 
little pain and no injuries the researchers said 
they called the results remarkable considering the subjects 
age and poor health condition at the start of the study seven had 
arthritis six had heart disease and four had hypertension 
the subjects stopped weightlifting at the end of the eightweek 
period and four weeks later they had lost about onethird of the 
strength they had gained ms fiatarone said 
a similar loss would be expected in a younger person she said 
noting that for the results to be lasting weighttraining must be 
done on a longterm basis 
although the study focused only on leg muscles ms fiatarone 
said it can be assumed weighttraining also would strengthen 
upperbody muscles in the elderly 
the researcher said the results indicate that weighttraining 
can be used in the elderly to help them gain strength and possibly 
avoid the falls and other accidents associated with weakness 
but ms herling said more research is needed to determine if 
weighttraining strengthens upperbody muscles in the very old 
adding that those muscles tend to be the weakest in the elderly 
but she also said that the study certainly sheds new light on 
the capabilities that these elderly patients can achieve and 
thats promising

the united states wont increase the number of 
soviet jews allowed into this country despite pressure from the 
soviet union and arab nations secretary of state james a baker 
iii said tuesday 
we make the point to the soviet union that we have had some 
rather dramatic increases in the numbers that we are admitting 
that at this time at least we dont think the united states can 
permit further increases because of budgetary concerns baker 
told the senate foreign relations committee 
the unprecedented number of jews allowed to leave the soviet 
union in recent months has outraged the arab world which is 
worried that israels population will increase and that emigres 
will be settled in territories captured from jordan and egypt in 
1967 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev has said the kremlin was 
under intense pressure from arab governments to stop the emigration 
to israel expected to reach as high as 150000 this year 
gorbachev at the end of a fourday summit with president bush 
earlier this month said emigration might be cut off unless israel 
stops settling soviet jews in the predominantly arab west bank and 
gaza strip israel denies it has such a settlement policy 
however baker said he had been assured by his soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze that the kremlin would not stop jewish 
emigration despite gorbachevs warning 
my sense is they the soviets are not going to cut it off 
but that could be proven wrong baker said 
the soviet union is eager for congressional approval of a trade 
agreement signed by bush and gorbachev at their summit but 
lawmakers told baker they would withhold support for any trade 
concessions if the soviets stop jewish emigration 
baker said the soviets have asked if the united states would 
accept more soviet jews as refugees or immigrants the united 
states he said said it had increased the number of permits for 
soviet refugees from 14000 in 1988 to 50000 in 1990 and was 
taking in another 20000 soviets not classified as refugees

shark hunter frank mundus who claims to be 
the model for the quint character in jaws says hes retiring 
to hawaii next year after half a century on the seas off long 
island 
anybody thats been in this business for 50 years has to have 
his head examined said mundus 64 
mundus is in the record books for catching the biggest great 
white shark ever snared with a rod and reel a 3450pound fish 
caught off montauk harbor in august 1986 
last summer when mundus tried to renew his lapsed captains 
license the coast guard discovered he could barely read he was 
denied a license and had to hire a licensed captain to operate his 
boat legally 
after decades of piloting his own boat he asked what do i 
need a bit of paper for 
mundus is a living legend in montauk which bills itself as the 
fishing capital of the world 
he claims and is generally believed to be the inspiration for 
the cantankerous shark hunter who meets his demise in the teeth of 
a great white in peter benchleys jaws 
his opinion of the movie the funniest thing ive ever seen 
hilarious stupid 
in october mundus sold his charter fishing business and his 
boat cricket ii to two used car salesmen he said he intends to 
move to kona on the island of hawaii at the end of the 1991 
summer season

its not that folks dislike george 
baker they simply mind his minesweeper docking along the black 
river 
i feel like an orphan this boat has become my obsession 
too much of an obsession i suppose baker said of the 98foot 
atlas right now though i need some place to park this damn 
thing 
baker 48 acquired the world war ii era vessel in 1988 when it 
sat on the bottom of the harbor at superior wis he raised the 
ship repaired it and brought it his hometown where he owned a 
steel fabrication business 
in may 1989 baker sold his steel business sailed the atlas to 
algonac anchored off harsens island and began turning the vessel 
into a recreational ship for charters he hopes to take in the 
virgin islands next year 
last november he sailed into port huron working in a factory 
by day and spending his free time renovating the atlas for the trip 
next winter to jacksonville fla 
for now though baker and the atlas apparently have used up 
their welcome in port huron 
property owners along the black river already forced baker to 
leave two of his moorings and the city is threatening to seek a 
court order barring the atlas from any mooring in the city without 
permission from the property owner 
michael west a lawyer representing the city said he knows that 
baker isnt annoying people on purpose but folks see him as a 
nuisance just the same 
we would prefer not to take him to court i wish he would just 
hurry up and move out of here if he had permission to be where he 
is that would be fine but he doesnt west said 
baker who has built or owned 54 boats in 30 years said he 
needs just one more berth and a few more weeks on the black river 
before the atlas will be ready to leave port huron forever 
i certainly havent wanted to stir up a hornets nest but the 
spring came so late this year i havent been able to do the work 
thats necessary to get this old girl out of here he said i 
am trying believe me i am trying

the republic of russia on tuesday proclaimed its 
sovereignty in a sharp break with the central soviet government 
and deputies said it will begin to chart its own course 
particularly on economic matters 
the declaration passed by the republics legislature carries 
no legal weight but is to serve as a blueprint for future 
decisions on the republics relations with the central government 
some deputies also said the republic had no intention of trying 
to secede from the soviet union 
the vote by the russian congress of peoples deputies came just 
before president mikhail s gorbachev met with the heads of all 15 
republics including russian president boris n yeltsin who led 
the sovreignty drive 
it was yeltsins first public meeting with the soviet leader 
since being elected president of russia on june 5 the huge 
republic has moscow as its capital and contains twothirds of 
soviet territory and just over half the countrys population 
gorbachev summoned the presidents of the republics to begin work 
on realizing the key idea of deeply reforming our federation 
he said the nightly news program vremya showed him speaking to 
the leaders at a long table in the kremlin 
gorbachev has long promised a revamped treaty among the 
republics guaranteeing their sovereignty but the republic decided 
to take its fate into its own hands ruslan khasbulatov deputy 
chairman of the congress of the russian federation told reporters 
he said the sovereignty declaration although it would have no 
immediate legal effect meant russia will no longer have to wait 
for intelligent thoughts to come down from above 
the announcement of the 90713 vote on the declaration was met 
with a rousing ovation by lawmakers 
tuesdays measure was weaker than an original proposal that 
would have proclaimed that russias sovereignty and total control 
of laws on its territory would come into force from the moment of 
its passage 
the version that was passed serves only as a political statement 
of intent 
khasbulatov said the stronger version was unacceptable and 
would have called forth a big clash and we needed to pass the 
declaration 
i think it has great political significance for our 
government and will hasten decentralization said khasbulatov a 
strong supporter of yeltsin 
he said russian leaders were particularly eager to start acting 
on their own ideas on economic reform 
deputies stressed that the proclamation did not amount to a 
declaration of independence like that made by the baltic republic 
of lithuania 
we didnt declare ourselves a separate government from the 
ussr khasbulatov said we think our russian fate should be 
within the framework of the ussr 
earlier in the day deputies voted 704206 not to drop the 
soviet socialist from the formal name of the russian soviet 
federated socialist republic 
yeltsin has been a strong proponent of russian sovereignty he 
included it in his platform for the presidency and predicted it 
would be declared in the first 100 days of his tenure 
there was no immediate public reaction to the sovereignty vote 
by gorbachev who has warned that the kremlin cannot carry out its 
reforms if the russian heartland is not firmly behind it 
yeltsin has said he hopes to cooperate with gorbachev despite 
their personal and political differences but that his first 
priority is defending russias interests

the house on monday approved a 10 million 
research program to develop new technologies and inspection 
programs to find defects in airplanes before they cause accidents 
the bill by rep tom lewis rfla was passed on a voice vote 
with no opposition a similar plan is being considered in the 
senate commerce science and transportation committee 
the legislation was prompted by the crash landing last july of a 
united airlines dc10 at sioux city iowa and an april 1988 
accident in which part of the top was ripped off an aloha airlines 
plane during a short interisland flight 
the national transportation safety board said both accidents 
could have been prevented through adequate inspection and 
maintenance programs 
for example the united crash landing in which 112 of the 296 
aboard were killed was caused by an engine failure due to a crack 
in a fan disk from a defect when the dc10 was manufactured in 1971 
the section of the aloha airliner was ripped off as the result 
of cracks in the outer metal covering that began almost 17 years 
earlier but went undetected the ntsb said 
in both cases the federal aviation administration began 
mandating inspections of aging airliners for such defects and 
cracks only after the accidents 
the status quo for too long has been to do something about a 
problem only after it costs lives lewis said 
the bill would require the faa to devote 10 million of its 
research over the next three years to addressing the risks of 
component failures and coming up with a program to prevent them

towering columns of black smoke 
and balls of flames were replaced tuesday by a gray cloud 
surrounding the rear section of the crippled supertanker mega borg 
that signaled that firefighters were gaining control of the 
blaze after four days 
although the plume could be seen on the clear horizon from 
galveston 57 miles away the fire clearly was at its lowest level 
since the tanker erupted in flames early saturday during the 
transfer of some of its cargo of 38 million gallons of light 
african crude oil 
five fireboats showered the rear section of the tanker with 10 
water cannons three of the hoses pointed at the listing left side 
and the seven others aimed at the right rear 
another water hose was anchored to the deck of the mega borg and 
pointed toward the fireravaged superstructure 
the superstructure wracked by explosions and flames for three 
days was engulfed in gray smoke tuesday 
the left rear of the ship was extremely close to being awash 
but the thick smoke prevented a view of the stern which the coast 
guard said monday had dipped below the surface of the gulf of 
mexico 
earlier a long trail of flaming oil snaked from rear of the 
ship but by tuesday only a small pool of oil about a halfmile 
away was burning the coast guard said later it had burned itself 
out 
a slick of rusty brown oil extended a short distance from the 
rear of the ship while a thin and broader sheen was more 
widespread around the vessel 
one fireboat was fastened to the right side of the tanker 
another vessel moored near the bow on the left side blue barrels 
containing chemical foam were clearly visible on some of the 
fireboats but were untouched as of tuesday morning no flames could 
be seen 
a coast guard cutter patrolled the area west of the ship while 
several other boats with oilcollecting booms extending from their 
sides were sucking up patches of oil farther from the tanker 
a mile or so away the heat from the fire created its own 
waterspout its thin dark finger spinning lazily like a slowmotion 
minitornado out of the smoke cloud

if fido goes into a frenzy over fast food 
you can always pick up a dog biscuit shaped like a cheeseburger at 
a drivethrough window that caters to canines 
when maggie patterson opened her doggiedrivethru in april her 
idea was met with skepticism 
people told me i was crazy patterson said tuesday but 
now that im open they tell me its the greatest idea since sliced 
bread 
now besides her homemade dog biscuits in the shapes of french 
fries and cheeseburgers shes trying to develop a pizzashaped 
biscuit and a diet puffed rice treat for the pooch with a 
paunch 
she mixes and bakes the biscuits using her own recipe of minced 
garlic wheat germ margarine eggs cheddar cheese molasses dry 
milk and whole wheat flour she works with a veterinarian and a 
hospital dietitian 
when the owner drives up patterson asks the dogs name and then 
offers a sample if the dog seems too shy or aggressive shell 
have the owner give it the treat 
after telling her biscuits ingredients and the prices 45 cents 
for a cheeseburger biscuit the size of a large cookie she gets 
the owner to talk about the dog something she finds people love 
to do 
meanwhile the dog is freaking out hes getting all the 
attention and nobody but him is getting anything to eat she said 
sometimes owners take their dog through as a birthday surprise 
and patterson accommodates by taking the dogs picture as a memento 
on a busy saturday she said as many as 100 cars pull up to her 
window 
the 9weekold business has created such a craze patterson 
said she has received dozens of requests for franchises 
patterson 33 said she owes the idea to her three dogs and 
their love of fastfood the people kind 
i used to give them cheeseburgers when wed go through 
mcdonalds but they started getting fat she said of her 
labrador cocker spaniel and poodle but every time theyd see 
those golden arches theyd still go crazy

hurricane hugo left death and 
destruction along south carolinas coast but also apparently a 
rainbow of flowers 
beside the creek here for example bright petunias bloom in 
yards where they never were planted by human hands no one knows 
for sure where the flowers came from but many believe hugo brought 
them 
weve got all kinds of stuff out of place thats the only 
logical thing for us to come up with said georgetown county 
agricultural agent laval oxendine 
when hugo hit in september the seeds of perennial flowers were 
mature and soon would have fallen into bed for the winter but the 
storms flooding and winds spread the seeds all along the coast 
oxendine said 
he said the seeds also may have come from wildflowers being 
planted to beautify highways 
hugo brought me a lot of weeds and it killed all my azaleas 
and it killed all my dogwoods but now i have a beautiful yard of 
petunias said norma thompson who lives here

an antismoking measure in a rural town lost 
its place in colorado history when city officials discovered it 
hadnt passed after all 
the election judges read the results backwards city 
administrator roy lauricello said monday 
about 17 percent of the estimated 4600 registered voters in 
this conservative eastern colorado town voted june 5 on the 
proposal to limit smoking in public 
afterward the city said the ordinance passed 431355 giving 
the city council 60 days to decide how strict to make the 
regulations 
but a recount monday revealed the measure actually failed by 11 
votes lauricello said 
im in a state of disbelief that an error of this size could 
have been made said mark simmerman a public health nurse who 
campaigned for the measure 
thirtyfour colorado cities and counties have enacted smoking 
restrictions but this would have been the first passed in a rural 
town according to the group to alleviate smoking pollution

a federal appeals court struck down tuesday a 
securities and exchange commission attempt to prevent corporations 
from creating unequal voting rights among their stockholders 
the threejudge appeals panel unanimously ruled in favor of an 
association of top corporations that had contended the sec was 
exceeding its authority by imposing a socalled one share one 
vote rule 
the rule in question sec rule 19c4 was adopted in july 1988 
it prohibited publicly traded corporations from weakening the 
voting power of existing stock holders by issuing new classes of 
stock with superior or supervoting rights 
the court upheld the arguments of the business roundtable which 
claimed the rule interfered with corporate governance authority 
traditionally left to the states 
the sec had claimed it had a right to impose the one share one 
vote rule as part of its mission under the 1934 law that created 
the commission to protect investors in publicly traded companies 
but the us circuit court of appeals for the district of 
columbia disagreed in an unusually sharp rebuke the court 
chastened the sec for trying to put its own spin on a statutory 
fragment 
sec officials had no immediate comment on the ruling saying 
they hadnt yet read it 
its a very important decision that limits the secs attempt 
to regulate corporate governance said washington attorney robert 
d rosenbaum who represented the business roundtable in oral 
arguments last november before the appeals court 
the business roundtable is an association of 200 corporations 
including such corporate giants as american express co xerox 
corp citicorp and general mills

farmers are harvesting a bumper crop of winter 
wheat despite some losses from wet weather and lower quality in 
some areas the agriculture department said tuesday 
production was estimated at a nineyear high of 209 billion 
bushels that was down fractionally from the may forecast but 
still 44 percent more than last years droughtbattered harvest of 
145 billion bushels 
figures released by the departments agricultural statistics 
board showed the decline from the may forecast was only about 01 
percent or less than 24 million bushels 
the average yield based on indications as of june 1 was 
estimated at 412 bushels per acre compared with 411 bushels 
indicated last month and the 1989 yield of 351 bushels 
farmers are expected to harvest fewer than 507 million acres 
down from 508 million indicated in may 
wet conditions have caused yield declines in the mississippi 
delta area the report said early harvested fields in arkansas 
had low test weights and diseases are a problem 
the missouri crop is developing late with about 23 percent 
turning color in the ripening process as of june 3 about 10 
days behind the usual pace the report said 
in kansas winter wheat production was estimated at 4602 
million bushels unchanged from the may forecast and more than 
double the shriveled 1989 harvest of 2136 million bushels 
winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the next year 
it accounts for about threefourths of the us total wheat 
production the remainder is planted in the spring 
the usdas first official estimate of 1990 production of all 
wheat will be issued july 12 the first estimates for corn 
soybeans and some other major springplanted crops are scheduled 
for aug 9 along with revised figures for wheat 
no official estimates of total 1990 wheat output based on field 
surveys were included 
however department analysts in a related report did project 
highly tentative 1990 production of all wheat at almost 269 
billion bushels up from fewer than 204 billion bushels last year 
and virtually unchanged from the may projection 
projections for all wheat and some other crops were based on 
yield trends and an assumption the crop would have normal weather 
the remainder of the growing season 
the 1990 corn harvest was projected at 81 billion bushels up 
from 753 billion harvested last year and unchanged from may 
soybean production was projected at 1925 billion bushels also 
unchanged from last month and virtually the same as the crop of 
1927 billion bushels in 1989 
according to the supplyanddemand report the us wheat 
stockpile was drained to a 15year low of 452 million bushels on 
june 1 the beginning of the new wheat marketing year but with the 
expected larger 1990 harvest the wheat stockpile could be rebuilt 
to about 772 million bushels a year from now 
the projected larger 1990 wheat harvest is putting pressure on 
market prices which were indicated in both may and june in the 
range of 290 to 330 per bushel in 199091 compared with an 
estimated 371 last season 
if corn production turns out at the projected level of 81 
billion bushels it still wouldnt be quite enough to match 
domestic and export demand the report showed thus the us corn 
stockpile which may be around 128 billion bushels next fall 
could edge lower by oct 1 1991 
corn prices were projected at 235 to 275 per bushel in 
199091 compared with the current seasons forecast of 235 to 
240 per bushel that was up 10 cents per bushel from last months 
199091 projection 
soybeans were indicated at an average of 625 per bushel in the 
199091 marketing year that begins sept 1 compared with 570 
this season that was unchanged from may

jury selection begins wednesday in the trial of 
three teenagers accused of raping and beating a central park 
jogger a case that relies mainly on what the defendants told 
police about each other 
the first hurdle will be finding 12 jurors who havent made up 
their mind about the wilding case which has received vast 
amounts of attention from new york newspapers radio and television 
stations 
about 500 people are expected in court to form the first pool 
from which lawyers will try to pick the dozen jurors and six 
alternates the jury will hear the cases against antron mccray and 
yusef salaam both 16 and raymond santana 15 
they and three other youths are charged with attacking an 
investment banker while she was jogging through the northern end of 
central park shortly before 10 pm on april 19 1989 
according to authorities a pack of more than 30 youths had 
entered the north end of the park together for what they called 
wilding a violent rampage through the park eventually splitting 
up into smaller groups they allegedly attacked two male joggers a 
homeless man and the female jogger who was gangraped and left 
for dead 
police said there were several rapes reported that night and 
there has been at least one equally brutal rape of a woman since 
but the central park case was especially shocking to new yorkers 
and continues to hold public attention 
on tuesday justice thomas galligan decided against allowing 
audiovisual coverage of the trial including live televiation and lies 
perpetrated 
against scared teenagers and their uncomprehending parents and 
guardians 
without the statements defense lawyers said after galligans 
ruling the prosecution would have had no case

a federal appeals court struck down tuesday a 
securities and exchange commission attempt to prevent corporations 
from creating unequal voting rights among their stockholders 
the threejudge appeals panel unanimously ruled in favor of an 
association of top corporations that had contended the sec was 
exceeding its authority by imposing a socalled one share one 
vote rule 
the rule in question sec rule 19c4 was adopted in july 1988 
it prohibited publicly traded corporations from weakening the 
voting power of existing stock holders by issuing new classes of 
stock with superior or supervoting rights 
the court upheld the arguments of the business roundtable which 
claimed the rule interfered with corporate governance authority 
traditionally left to the states 
the sec had claimed it had a right to impose the one share one 
vote rule as part of its mission under the 1934 law that created 
the commission to protect investors in publicly traded companies 
but the us circuit court of appeals for the district of 
columbia disagreed in an unusually sharp rebuke the court 
chastened the sec for trying to put its own spin on a statutory 
fragment 
sec officials had no immediate comment on the ruling saying 
they hadnt yet read it 
its a very important decision that limits the secs attempt 
to regulate corporate governance said washington attorney robert 
d rosenbaum who represented the business roundtable in oral 
arguments last november before the appeals court 
the business roundtable is an association of 200 corporations 
including such corporate giants as american express co xerox 
corp citicorp and general mills

the palestine liberation organization must 
discipline one of its top leaders as well as publicly condemn an 
attempted terrorist attack on israel to avoid cutoff of its 
dialogue with the united states secretary of state james a baker 
iii said tuesday 
baker told the senate foreign relations committee that an 
extraordinarily large number of our allies and friendly 
governments have urged the bush administration not to 
precipitously cut off the contact begun in an effort to promote 
peace in the middle east 
however baker said the united states will not allow our 
pursuit of peace to undercut our commitment to fight terrorism and 
i think the plo understands that 
the dialogue began in december 1988 after plo leader yasser 
arafat renounced terrorism and acknowledged israels right to exist 
in wideranging testimony before the panel baker summarized 
progress made at the recent ussoviet summit and reiterated 
administration hopes that a strategic nuclear weapons treaty can be 
sent to the senate for approval by the end of the year 
baker also 
said the united states and the soviet union could team up to 
sponsor peace talks in angola and that a ceasefire could include 
agreement by the two superpowers to halt flows of arms to the 
warring sides 
said the united states would not increase its ceiling on the 
number of soviet jews allowed into this country 
predicted soviet aid to cuba eventually will be curtailed 
because of moscows increasing domestic needs 
said the administration accepts that congress will not approve 
a new ussoviet trade agreement until moscow eases an economic 
embargo against freedomminded lithuania 
praised recent multiparty elections in czechoslovakia in which 
prodemocracy groups received a plurality however he said the 
administration would reserve judgment on the bulgarian elections 
where the socialist party the former communists received almost 
half the vote 
said moscow would have to understand us insistence on full 
nato membership for a united germany and why continuation of th 
alliance is indispensable 
speaking about the aborted attack against israel baker said he 
told nato foreign ministers meeting last week in scotland that 
there were two conditions for continued us diplomatic contacts 
with the group specific condemnation of the thwarted may 30 attack 
on a beach near tel aviv and steps toward disciplining abul abbas 
a member of the plos executive council and leader of the radical 
faction that carried out the attack 
we are hopeful we will get these responses baker said 
not optimistic but hopeful 
so far plo statements have fallen short of the mark he 
told the committee because they neither specifically condemn the 
raid nor indicate the possibility of punishment for abbas leader 
of the palestine liberation front 
bakers comments came as seven senators including majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine introduced a resolution calling 
for a cutoff of the dialogue if the plo fails to condemn the attack 
and expel abbas from the executive committee in the immediate 
future 
other sponsors included sens connie mack rfla joseph 
lieberman dconn frank lautenberg dnj charles grassley 
riowa bob graham dfla and don nickles rokla

much of the oil buying was technically motivated representing a 
reaction to the recent steep declines in crude prices 
peter beutel who tracks the energy markets for merrill lynch amp 
co said gasoline prices were driven higher by short covering 
which is buying by investors who had previously sold under a short 
contract refiners and others bought crude aggressively against the 
gasoline contract he said 
various factors also gave energy brokers an incentive to buy 
an announcement from royal dutchshell that it was curtailing 
shipments of its petroleum products to the united states in its own 
vessels supported prices the oil giant has been concerned about 
liability costs associated with environmental damage from recent 
tanker spills 
news that the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
might convene an emergency meeting to discuss oil price weakness 
also spurred buying 
united arab emirates oil minister mana saeed otaiba said at a 
news conference in egypt that the oil cartel has begun preparation 
for a new opec ministerial conference and if neccessity calls 
for such an emergency conference it will be held

told premier marian calfa an excommunist he can keep his job and 
form the countrys first democratically elected government in more 
than 40 years 
havel and calfa are leaders of the two groups that led last 
winters anticommunist revolution and won last weeks elections 
the official news agency ctk said havel tapped calfa after a 
meeting of the leaders of the two groups havels civic forum and 
calfas public against violence agreed calfa should form the new 
government 
the two groups together won 46 percent of parliaments 300 seats 
in the elections held friday and saturday they need a 
fiveeighths majority to push through constitutional reform 
calfas spokesman ivan fiala said he believed calfa would be 
ready to present the new government and its program to parliament 
within two weeks 
parliament will then elect a new president almost certainly 
havel to serve for two years before new elections 
the leader of slovakias conservative christian democrats who 
came in third in the election after the communists told ctk in an 
interview that his party will stay in the opposition 
the christian democratic movement will not join a coalition 
with the civic forum and will have no participation in the future 
government ctk quoted jan carnogursky as saying 
carnogursky a former leading dissident indicated his ambitions 
would be limited to his native slovakia 
calfa a slovak was havels choice for the premiership sources 
inside civic forum and public against violence made clear before 
last weekends elections however that they were not happy with the 
choice of a former communist 
calfa 44 became premier during the bargaining that led last 
december to the formation of a government of national 
understanding dominated by civic forum 
the premier a lawyer from slovakia turned in his communist 
party card in january and since then is said by havel aides to have 
impressed the president with his political skills 
calfa was a top candidate for public against violence in the 
elections civic forum and its ally won 46 percent of the vote and 
a projected 169 of the 300 seats in the federal parliament

secret police for the last 17 years

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
tuesday the united states might consider cutting off arms supplies 
to rebels in angola if the sovietsupported government agrees to 
hold free elections 
baker also said the united states and soviet union had proposed 
joint sponsorship of talks between the angolan government and the 
unita rebels on ending the african countrys 15year civil war 
the united states secretly funnels weapons to unita an acronym 
for the first letters in portuguese of the name of the group the 
union for the total independence of angola 
us aid has been estimated at between 40 million and 80 
million annually the state department contends the soviets provide 
the angolan government weapons worth about 600 million to 800 
million a year 
asked at a hearing of the senate foreign relations committee 
about a soviet suggestion that both sides stop arming their allies 
in angola baker said that would be a part i think of an 
agreement perhaps if we could ever once get to a ceasefire and a 
commitment that there could in fact be open free and fair 
elections 
a usbacked ceasefire between the warring sides failed last 
summer and repeated attempts to start peace talks through the 
mediation of zaires president mobutu sese seko failed 
a possible breakthrough occurred last april when the rebels and 
government representatives met in portugal and agreed to meet 
again but angolas president jose eduardo dos santos still refuses 
to accept unitas demands for free elections in the oneparty state 
i think there is potential for moving toward peace in angola 
as a consequence of united statessoviet cooperation in various 
parts of the world baker told the committee 
baker said that when he met with his soviet counterpart eduard 
shevardnadze at namibias independence celebrations last march 
the united states proposed joint sponsorship of angolan peace 
talks and the soviets thought it would be a good idea 
soviet and us cooperation in resolving conflicts in their 
spheres of influence around the world has already led to the 
agreement for namibias independence from south africa also 
presidents bush and mikhail gorbachev announced at the end of their 
summit earlier this month that they had agreed to fly us food on 
soviet planes to starving ethiopians 
meanwhile a group of black leaders met with house speaker tom 
foley dwash tuesday seeking a congressional review of us 
policy towards angola including a cutoff of aid to unita 
it didnt produce much in the way of concrete results 
randall robinson of the transafrica lobbying group said of the 
meeting he said he and others were not pleased with the lack 
of urgency expressed by foley and reps david bonior dmich and 
steny hoyer dmd 
jesse jackson one of the blacks who attended the hourlong 
meeting said the bottom line was that the democrats have been 
working handinhand with republicans in promoting the current 
policy on angola 
jeff biggs a spokesman for foley said the house members were 
interested in the black leaders views but they made no immediate 
commitment on policy

kids in the 90s will have bolder brighter 
crayola crayons fuchsia dandelion and cerulean a fancy word for 
sky blue 
crayons in orange red violet blue and other boring er simple 
colors their parents and grandparents used will fade into history 
for the first time since 1972 the company is adding eight 
colors and for the first time since crayola crayons were created in 
1903 retiring eight others 
were introducing the new colors in response to what kids told 
us they wanted said brad drexler spokesman for binney and 
smith the maker of crayola crayons in this eastern pennsylvania 
city 
the company interviewed about 150 children aged 7 and under more 
than a year ago and learned that they wanted crayons in bolder 
brighter colors drexler said 
binney and smith developed new hues and gave them upbeat names 
like wild strawberry vivid tangerine teal blue royal purple and 
jungle green as well as fuchsia dandelion and cerulean 
to make room in the deluxe 72crayon case binney and smith 
decided to discontinue the colors blue gray green blue violet 
blue orange red orange yellow lemon yellow maize and raw umber 
for example drexler said the bright and brilliant dandelion 
replaces maize a dull pale almost mustard yellow 
crayon packs with the new colors are already being shipped from 
the plant but they may not appear on store shelves until july 
drexel said 
the largest package of 72 crayons comes in a plastic case with a 
handle what drexler called a yuppie version of the classic 
64pack that dates from 1957 it was upgraded in 1972 with eight 
fluorescent colors

president bush and east german prime minister 
lothar de maiziere rejected a soviet suggestion tuesday that a 
united germany be only an associate member of nato 
bush said however that it was a proposal that us and soviet 
officials would discuss without rancor in an effort to reach 
agreement 
and de maiziere who met with bush on monday said he sees bush 
and soviet president mikhail gorbachev coming closer together over 
the military stance of a unified germany 
gorbachev said in a speech to the supreme soviet legislature 
tuesday that he could accept a german associate status in nato 
provided there were no changes in the mutual obligations that 
east germany now has to the eastern bloc and west germany to nato 
bush reiterated his insistence that the new germany belongs in 
the western military alliance with no strings attached and said the 
latest proposal sounded similar to what gorbachev discussed at the 
superpower summit here two weeks ago 
but the more talking we do the more convinced i am that they 
will see that what were proposing is more stabilizing and is best 
for the soviet union as well as western europe and eastern 
europe bush said 
de maiziere told the national press club that he too rejected 
gorbachevs latest idea 
we have heard in the past a series of soviet proposals on what 
the solution could be de maiziere said and now we have one 
from president gorbachev i believe it is one of the proposals that 
will be discussed but it wont be the solution 
he said he relayed to bush a position that gorbachev presented 
to him during the warsaw pact summit in moscow last week moving 
toward a treaty covering the temporary presence of soviet troops in 
east germany after east and west germany unify 
and i had the impression that he bush listened with great 
interest de maiziere said 
the east german leader who came to power as a result of east 
germanys first free elections last march 18 said he was 
sympathetic to soviet concerns about withdrawing troops from east 
germany 
gorbachev insists that the 380000 soviet troops stationed in 
east germany remain there for a transitional period 
of course were trying to establish a sovereign united 
germany de maiziere said it remains to be seen whether we can 
find a treaty settlement that contains the presence of troops for a 
specified time 
we accept that the immediate withdrawal is neither socially 
nor ecologically nor economically feasible he said 
the two germanys are merging their currencies on july 2 and are 
headed toward full political union

the united states and chile have reached 
agreement on procedures for chile to pay compensation to the family 
of a former chilean diplomat who was assassinated in washington in 
1976 the state department said tuesday 
orlando letelier and an associate died in a car bombing and 
us authorities blamed agents of the military government that then 
ruled chile 
chiles new 3monthold government has agreed to pay 
compensation for the deaths of letelier and ronni moffitt without 
admission of official liability by the previous government 
the military government ignored a 1980 order by a us federal 
district judge to pay families of the victims 29 million 
an international commission set up years ago to help settle 
bilateral disputes will determine the amount of compensation to be 
paid the state department said the chilean congress then will be 
asked to approve the request 
the bilateral agreement outlining the procedure was signed 
monday 
letelier an outspoken opponent of the military government had 
served as foreign minister and held other high posts in the 
government of leftist president salvador allende 
the state department statement referred only briefly to the 
question of culpability for the murders 
both governments recognize that bringing to trial those 
responsible for the murders of orlando letelier and ronni moffitt 
is of utmost importance it said 
during the administration of president augusto pinochet chilean 
authorities refused to turn over three security officers wanted in 
the united states for the killings 
but a few weeks after pinochet turned over the presidency to an 
elected successor patricio alwyn the chilean supreme court 
decided to reopen the case 
a cuban exile who had eluded authorities for 12 years was 
arrested april 11 in st petersburg fla on five felony charges 
related to the bombing 
jose dionisio suarez esquivel indicted in 1978 with seven 
others has pleaded innocent to the charges

five states sued mobil chemical co on tuesday 
charging the company falsely claimed its hefty trash bags and 
grocery bags would decompose 
mobil announced in march that it would stop referring to its 
hefty bags as biodegradable because of confusion about what 
degradable means 
lawsuits were filed by massachusetts minnesota texas 
california and wisconsin new york and washington state were also 
expected to file lawsuits 
the lawsuits contend mobil made false claims for the hefty bags 
in advertisements by saying they break down when exposed to sun 
wind and rain 
allen gray a spokesman for mobil chemical said the company had 
been talking with states and had hoped to resolve questions about 
its claims without a lawsuit 
were disappointed here he said and noted that the company 
already voluntarily agreed to drop its claims for bags because 
there is no agreement on how to define the term biodegradable 
the massachusetts lawsuit said the degradability claim violated 
the state consumer protection act the bags do not perform as 
promised because they are ultimately incinerated or disposed of in 
landfills where they decompose no faster than ordinary plastic 
bags the lawsuit alleges 
promoting plastics as degradable may actually cause consumers 
to increase the amount of their litter because they may believe 
that the products will degrade rapidly if littered said the 
lawsuit filed in superior court at suffolk county 
in march gray said claims that the bags degrade in sunlight had 
been fully substantiated by tests and that the company never said 
the bags would be the answer to the countrys waste disposal 
problem 
the company said it would continue to make hefty trash bags with 
an environmentally safe additive that speeds up their 
decomposition when exposed to sunlight 
gray conceded that if left out in arizona somewhere as bag 
with the additive can quickly decompose in a couple of months but 
in a northern climate like chicago it could take well over a year 
mobil made its announcement shortly before it was to meet with a 
task force of state attorney generals investigating deceptive 
advertising and packaging 
massachusetts is seeking civil penalties of 5000 for each 
violation of the state consumer protection act in massachusetts 
mobil sold or distributed an estimated 112000 cases of hefty bags 
and more than 75 million marketote grocery sacks between june and 
december of 1989 according to the lawsuit 
tom mcnaught a spokesman for state attorney general james 
shannon said the state also wanted assurances that mobil has 
permanently dropped the degradability references 
minnesota is seeking 250000 in damages 
unfortunately mobils advertising claims break down faster 
than their garbage bags said minnesota attorney general hubert 
humphrey iii at a news conference in st paul minn 
the california lawsuit seeks civil penalties of 500000 and an 
injunction to formally halt the ads 
in wisconsin attorney general don hanaway said these claims 
prey on peoples desire to play a role in protecting the 
environment 
hefty bags need to be exposed to a minimum of 26 to 42 days of

president vytautas landsbergis and with the leaders of the two 
other baltic states for the first time on tuesday since he declared 
their independence moves illegal

tel aviv beach by palestinian guerillas replied no decision on 
that yet 
theres quite a bit going on behind the scenes but i just 
cant tell you he said

tuesday with egyptian president hosni mubarak but im not 
prepared to make my decision known on that yet he said 
i want to see that terrorist act condemned and those who did 
it condemned he added

a judge said an internal revenue service 
agent was incompetent and rude in her dealings with a couple who 
owed back taxes 
us district judge b avant edenfield on monday removed irs 
agent sherilyn heyward from the case of brenda and alan stout 
owners of a garden city convenience store 
the combination of incompetence and rudeness with which the 
stouts were treated at the hands of heyward and her supervisor is 
unacceptable the judges order said adding that it 
demonstrates the irss lack of organization and respect for the 
taxpayers 
the judge last month voided a search warrant he had approved for 
a search of the stouts business the affidavit contended mrs 
stout was switching bank accounts in an effort to conceal assets 
and avoid paying 10900 in back taxes 
the stouts have complained that irs officials gave them four 
different figures to satisfy the taxes their business was raided 
may 10 by six agents who took 246 belonging to an employee and 
money collected from the sale of novelty clowns by a private 
citizen evidence showed 
the agents also rifled through business records froze the 
companys bank account and filed a lien on the company that 
supplies the business oil and gas 
the stouts are now trying to sell their business to satisfy the 
irs bill 
the judge said the irs agents affidavit was probably 
intentionally misleading while the affidavit said the stouts owed 
753295 plus penalties it did not mention nearly 90000 in back 
taxes were paid within the last year 
heyward could not be reached for comment tuesday afternoon 
telephone information in savannah lists only an s heyward with a 
nonpublished number 
an irs spokesman in atlanta said the agencys lawyers would 
review the order before issuing a response

a single berlin government met for the first 
time in four decades on tuesday and decided to swiftly demolish the 
rest of the berlin wall 
city council members from both sides of the city gathered in 
east berlins historic rotes rathaus a monumental redbrick 
building that was the seat of local government for more than a 
century 
the two councils agreed to begin on wednesday the final 
demolition of the wall that split the city for 29 years 
we are already now one city said east berlin mayor tino 
schwierzina who was elected in east germanys first free local 
elections in may 
one section of wall is to remain standing as a memorial to the 
people who were killed trying to flee from east germany to the west 
the demolition is to be completed by july 2 when the two german 
states are to merge their economies in the major step to full 
unification 
the meeting of the west berlin senate and the east berlin 
magisrat was the first involving local officials from both berlins 
since 1948 after germany and its capital were both carved in two 
by the victorious world war ii allies 
the two councils which meet separately once a week plan to 
meet jointly every two weeks until full unification takes place and 
a single government is chosen in new local elections 
east germanys former communist government was toppled by mass 
protests in october and the wall was opened in november since 
then germans have been able to pass back and forth between the 
cities and the two nations 
border crossings still are staffed by guards on both sides of 
the wall and cursory passport checks are still made foreigners can 
pass only through two points 
some of the most famous stretches of the berlin wall have 
already been demolished but most of the wall still snakes around 
west berlin 
berlin was divided into four sectors following world war ii 
with the soviets in control of the east and france britain and the 
united states in control of the west 
east berlin is the capital of east germany but west berlin is 
still technically under military occupation and not part of the 
territory of west germany 
the four allies are expected to negotiate an end to their direct 
involvement in the cities during the series of ongoing talks that 
also are dealing with the future strategic allegiance of a united 
germany 
the allies are to hold their next negotiations on june 22 in 
east berlin 
the unity process in berlin is being carried out considerably 
faster than in any place else in germany but also the problems are 
greater than anywhere else west berlin mayor walter momper told 
a news conference after the council meeting 
last week us officials said they would take down checkpoint 
charlie the allied checkpoint that was perhaps the worlds most 
famous border crossing and a symbol of the cold war 
many germans expect that berlin will return as the capital of 
germany after unification the west german seat of government was 
moved to bonn after the war

eight of 10 americans believe patients should 
be allowed to die in some circumstances and about half say some 
incurably ill people have a moral right to commit suicide 
according to a poll released tuesday 
the poll by the times mirror center for the people and the 
press was conducted a month before dr jack kevorkian a retired 
pathologist in pontiac mich assisted in the june 4 suicide of 
janet adkins who had been diagnosed as being in the early stages 
of alzheimers disease 
diane colasanto a researcher for the times mirror center who is 
based in princeton nj said the survey did not include any 
questions about physicianassisted suicide but added i think 
what we found is relevant to the kevorkian case 
the survey found that 80 percent of those polled believed there 
are some circumstances in which a patient should be allowed to die 
only 15 percent thought doctors and nurses should always do 
everything possible to save a patients life 
fortynine percent said a person with an incurable disease has 
the moral right to commit suicide compared with the 40 percent who 
expressed such a view in a 1975 gallup poll 
fiftyfive percent said there is a moral right to commit suicide 
if a person is suffering great pain with no hope of improvement 
fortyone percent held such a view in the 1975 survey 
susan m wolf a lawyer with the hastings center a research 
institute in briarcliff manor ny that studies medical ethics 
said there is a clear distinction between a doctor withholding life 
support and a doctor assisting in a suicide 
both medical ethics and law treat those things as exact 
opposites of one another she said in both ethics and law it 
is very widely agreed now that the doctor is really mandated to 
stop lifesustaining treatment at the patients request on the 
other hand when you get to the question of physicianassisted 
suicide both medical ethics and the criminal law roundly condemn 
that as it stands 
many states have righttodie laws but the question has 
remained a controversial one the supreme court is expected to rule 
soon on the efforts of a missouri couple to remove life support 
from their 31yearold daughter nancy cruzan who was severely 
brain damaged in a car crash the justice department has sided with 
the state of missouri in attempting to block removal of the 
lifesupport equipment 
in 1985 the lou harris polling organization asked whether a 
patient who was terminally ill with no hope in sight had the 
right to ask a doctor to be put out of misery sixtyone percent 
said yes 31 percent said it would be wrong to make such a 
request 
ms colasanto said the percentage of affirmative responses was 
an increase over previous polls on the same question 
a poll last year by opinion research associates said that 66 
percent of people surveyed believed a physician should be allowed 
by law to end the life of an incurably ill patient she said 
kevorkian has not been charged oakland county circuit judge 
alice gilbert ordered him to stop using a device he calls the 
suicide machine or taking other steps to help people kill 
themselves until prosecutors decide whether to try him prosecutors 
say toxicological tests on ms adkins brain to determine whether 
the 54yearold portland ore woman had alzheimers disease 
will take up to two months 
the times mirror center an adjunct of the times mirror 
publishing and broadcasting organization conducted telephone 
interviews with 1213 adults from may 1 to may 5 it said the 
results are subject to an error of plus or minus 3 percentage 
points

president bush saying flag desecration is 
unacceptable and must carry a price asked congress on tuesday 
to pass a constitutional amendment restoring special protection by 
the fourth of july 
house speaker thomas s foley said he would allow a vote within 
two weeks but added that he would break tradition and vote on the 
measure himself in order to emphasize his opposition to what he saw 
as meddling with the first amendment foley accused bush of trying 
to take political advantage from an issue that goes to the 
heart of the bill of rights 
what that flag encapsules is too sacred to be abused bush 
said at the white house after receiving on his 66th birthday a 
miniature replica of the iwo jima memorial the marines famed 
flagraising sculpture 
bush joined republican lawmakers in demanding quick action from 
the democraticcontrolled house and senate on the amendment which 
would restore legal protections wiped out by supreme court rulings 
last june and again on monday 
foley dwash said they would get their vote but he also said 
he didnt like what was being done in the name of patriotism 
every country has a flag we are one of the few countries that 
has a bill of rights he said before bush spoke 
to make it a partisan issue to attempt to take political 
advantage out of a question that has a deep relevance to the 
protection of our constitutional integrity and to the protection of 
the first amendment is not in my judgment worthy of the president 
and im sorry hes doing it foley said 
bush said it was not a partisan issue but he said youre darn 
right when asked if he planned to talk about the flag in the 
upcoming election campaign 
he said the amendment was an american issue and so i call on 
the congress to act by july fourth this nations birthday 
the law books are full of restrictions on free speech and we 
ought to have this be one of them said the president flag 
burning endangers the fabric of our country and i think it ought 
to be outlawed he said 
bush said the amendment is the surest safest way to guarantee 
that while speech remains free flag desecration is unacceptable 
and must carry a price 
he lavished praise on the replica of the iwo jima memorial by 
sculptor felix deweldon of oregon they were joined in the rose 
garden by sen mark hatfield rore who fought at iwo jima where 
almost 7000 americans perished in the 1945 
hatfield voted against the constitutional amendment last year 
but his office said he would reluctantly support it now 
earlier gop leaders emerged from a strategy meeting with bush 
sharply criticizing the supreme courts 54 ruling monday striking 
down the federal flag protection law enacted last october 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan pulling a small flag 
from his pocket said he would press for a vote on thursday flag 
day 
the democrats should give us a very quick vote said dole 
we dont need more hearings 
he took a jab at supreme court justice john paul stevens who 
voted to uphold the federal law but in his dissent criticized 
politicians who manipulate the symbol of national purpose for 
partisan disputes 
were not manipulating snapped dole he said stevens has a 
right to criticize politicians and we have a right to criticize 
the court and theyre wrong 
bush made an issue in the 1988 campaign of his opponent michael 
dukakis veto as governor of massachusetts of a law that would have 
penalized public school teachers who refused to lead the pledge of 
allegiance 
bush went to the actual iwo jima memorial in nearby arlington 
va last june 30 to unveil his proposed amendment which states 
the congress and the states shall have power to prohibit the 
physical desecration of the flag of the united states 
that was two days after the first supreme court ruling striking 
down state laws that made flag desecration a crime the senate 
subsequently fell 15 votes short of the twothirds majority needed 
to pass the bush amendment it got a bare 5148 majority 
the bill of rights comprising the first 10 amendments to the 
constitution has never been amended 
a constitutional amendment requires twothirds majorities in 
both the senate and house and approval by 38 of the 50 state 
legislatures 
rep craig washington dtexas said tuesday were called 
upon in this body to decide what is more sacred the constitution 
or the flag it would seem to me the constitution is more sacred

wrongsize bolts were fitted to a jetliner 
windshield that blew out in flight sucking the pilot halfway out 
the cockpit government officials said tuesday 
british airways said a maintenance engineer involved in the 
installation was suspended as standard procedure during inquiries 
cabin staff saved pilot tim lancaster 41 on sunday clutching 
his ankles as he was bounced against the nose cone for 15 minutes 
over england until the copilot of the twinengine bac 111 made an 
emergency landing at southampton 
an interim report from the department of transports air 
accident investigation branch said the diameter of 84 of the 90 
bolts was too small for the captive nuts into which they fitted to 
hold the windshield in place 
lancaster suffered broken bones bruises and frostbite but 
southampton general hospital said it expected to discharge him 
wednesday 
investigators said the blowout occurred as the 18yearold 
aircraft was climbing from birmingham airport at 17000 feet 
carrying six crew and 81 passengers bound from birmingham to 
malaga spain 
the 2by3foot windshield was found on the ground 
investigators were trying to find out if the bolts were wrongly 
manufactured or incorrectly packaged when delivered or if the 
airlines own engineers selected the wrong bolts 
they said the windshield was fitted during routine maintenance 
the day before the incident not two days and the plane was at 
17000 feet when the blowout took place not 23000 feet as 
earlier reported 
british airways was checking out all its 34 bac 111s

israels arab neighbors warned tuesday the 
jewish states new rightwing government is a threat to the peace 
process and could lead to war 
in a statement the egyptian government said israel has 
apparently begun to prepare for aggression and war 
the official cairo radio reported that president hosni mubarak 
telephoned president bush to discuss current developments in the 
middle east the radio gave no further details 
egypt is the only arab state to have signed a peace treaty with 
israel 
in jordan king hussein called the new israeli government a 
dangerous threat and reiterated his call for a peaceful 
solution to the arabisraeli conflict 
the form of the new israeli government constitutes a dangerous 
threat to the stability of this region because the foundations 
which led to the establishment of this government make it the most 
extremist israeli government ever formed hussein told the 
visiting soviet deputy foreign minister vladimir petrovsky 
husseins statements were carried by jordans official petra 
news agency 
on monday parliament narrowly approved a new government headed 
by prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing likud bloc the 
governing coalition also includes several farright and religious 
factions 
the government has promised new measures to crush the 
30monthlong palestinian rebellion against israels occupation of 
the west bank and gaza strip and is committed to increasing jewish 
settlement in those areas 
shamirs alliance has also ruled out any direct or indirect 
talks with the palestine liberation organization one twoman party 
within the governing coalition advocates the expulsion of arabs 
from the occupied territories 
in syria president hafez assad warned of a new war with the 
jewish state and said a confrontation will be bloodier than any of 
the previous wars 
speaking at a session of the national council or parliament 
assad said wars today will not be like the wars fought in the 
past which left low casualties 
assad said israel remains technologically superior and can 
cause disasters in times of war however the arabs can reciprocate 
and the disasters will be more serious to israel 
israel has fought four wars against its arab neighbors since the 
jewish state declared independence in 1948 israel emerged 
victorious in the wars of 1948 1956 1967 and 1973 but at 
considerable cost 
israel also invaded lebanon in 1982 in an effort to drive the 
plo from that country israel withdrew the bulk of its invasion 
force in 1985 but still maintains a small security strip along its 
northern frontier 
tensions in the middle east have been increasing as arab 
countries continue to stockpile missiles and develop chemical 
weapons in an effort to match israels military superiority

the house in the face of an administration 
veto threat voted overwhelmingly tuesday to send president bush a 
bill allowing federal workers to take an active role in politics 
for the first time in half a century 
by a 33487 vote the house forfeited its own version of hatch 
act changes to adopt a senate bill that is less onerous to the 
white house but is still opposed by top administration officials 
ninety of the 176 republicans including minority leader robert 
h michel of illinois joined 244 democrats to pass the bill three 
democrats reps anthony beilenson of california charles bennett 
of florida and thomas foglietta of pennsylvania voted against the 
measure 
unlike the original house bill approved more than a year ago 
the measure that being sent to bush retains prohibitions against 
federal workers running for partisan office or soliciting campaign 
funds from the public 
the senate passed the same bill last month by a vote of 6730 
but gop leaders there have expressed confidence they can persuade 
one or two of their colleagues to change votes to sustain a veto 
attorney general dick thornburgh said in a letter tuesday that 
he and other senior bush advisers would recommend that the 
president veto the bill 
such a reversal in the role of partisan politics in the ethic 
of public service would permit virtually unbridled partisan 
activities by federal employees thornburgh said in a letter to 
house gop whip newt gingrich of georgia 
as passed by both houses the bill substantially erases 
prohibitions under the 51yearold hatch law that restrict th 
nations 3 million federal civil service and postal employees to 
little more than voting 
if enacted into law those employees could begin holding office 
in local state and national political party organizations for the 
first time they also could solicit campaign funds from coworkers 
on behalf of federal employee union political action committees 
but only when not working 
however federal workers would still be prohibited from running 
in a partisan election for public office or soliciting campaign 
funds from anyone other than fellow members of government employee 
unions 
the original house version approved by a 29790 vote in april 
1989 would have allowed government workers to take leaves of 
absence to run for partisan office and solicit campaign funds from 
anyone 
government workers in the soviet union enjoy more freedom to 
practice politics than americas government workers said rep 
william ford dmich one of the bills sponsors 
we are not advocating the gray masses rising up in a 
coup ford said were only asking for the simple right to put 
up a yard sign display a bumper sticker send a check or stuff 
envelopes 
the hatch act was enacted at the height of the new deal to 
protect the emerging civil service from being coerced by political 
appointees to contribute to or work on behalf of candidates 
the americans who guide the planes we fly and who deliver 
the mail deserve our trust in the very modest right to participate 
in the political process said rep gerry sikorski dminn 
opponents argue that the laws protections against a spoils 
system are still needed 
times have changed but the factors that make the hatch act 
necessary have not changed said rep frank wolf rva human 
nature has not been repealed by congress the inevitable result 
will be a politicizing of the federal work force

the makers of midol a menstrual relief 
medication agreed tuesday to pay 375000 in fines to settle a 
complaint that the company had made unsubstantiated advertising 
claims 
the consent agreement with the federal trade commission is 
without admission of any wrongdoing said terry kelley a 
spokesman for sterling drug inc which makes midol 
kelley said the company the nations largest manufacturer of 
overthecounter menstrual relief medicine entered into the 
agreement to avoid protracted costly litigation 
it would have involved highly technical scientific issues 
said kelley 
this does not involve our current advertising kelley said 
explaining that all of the questionable advertising had been 
stopped by march sterling will continue to manufacture and 
market the midol brand products 
the ftc said sterling had violated a 1985 order prohibiting a 
firm from making performance claims unless it has a reasonable 
basis to substantiate the claims 
the complaint said sterling ran certain ads for original 
formula midol and maximum strength midol for cramps from 
march 1985 to january 1986 and in april 1988 that claimed or 
implied one of the ingredients was a muscle relaxant for menstrual 
cramps that would quickly help relieve muscle contractions 
the company did not have competent and reliable scientific 
evidence for those claims the agency said in its complaint 
the ingredient in question has been removed from the 
product according to sterling 
virtually all of the companys products were included in the 
ftcs advertising complaint 
also cited were ads for maximum strength midol pms which 
claimed total or complete relief for the symptoms of 
premenstrual syndrome 
the ftc also said the company had no competent and reliable 
scientific evidence for claims that original midol mutisymptom 
formula and maximum strength midol multisymptom formula 
relieved menstrual bloating and waterweight gain 
sterling is based in new york city and is a whollyowned 
subsidiary of the eastmankodak co

the white house on tuesday brushed aside a 
report linking the cia to the 1962 arrest of antiapartheid leader 
nelson mandela saying there was no value in reviewing a 
30yearold history 
i havent looked into it yet bush said in response to 
questions about the report published earlier this week in an 
atlanta newspaper 
his spokesman marlin fitzwater earlier dismissed the report 
saying we just dont comment on these kinds of intelligence 
matters and we dont intend to 
our attitude toward mr mandela is one of total support and we 
want to demonstrate that to him when he comes fitzwater said 
mandela 71 who heads the african national congress will visit 
the white house on june 25 he was freed from a south african 
prison earlier this year after 27 years 
in a sometimes testy exchange with reporters fitzwater 
repeatedly refused to confirm or deny a report in an atlanta 
newspaper earlier this week that the cia had helped arrange 
mandelas arrest on aug 5 1962 
nor would he say whether the administration felt mandela were 
owed an apology 
we welcome mr mandela to this country the president 
personally called him and invited him we recognize the outstanding 
contributions that he has made to the fight against apartheid in 
his country and the contributions he has made to fight racism 
around the world fitzwater said 
we want his presence here to highlight that fact we want to 
fight apartheid as best we can and we find no value in reviewing a 
30yearold history in this case 
asked whether bush as a former central intelligence agency 
director was concerned about allegations fitzwater said im 
not going to comment on it i just wont do it 
the atlanta journalconstitution reported that a senior cia 
official claimed credit for mandelas capture within hours of his 
arrest the newspaper quoted an unidentified intelligence 
officer as saying that a tip from a paid cia informant led to 
mandelas arrest 
bush was asked whether he would apologize to mandela 
i dont know what ill do about that but im very pleased 
that hes coming here im very pleased that he is free the 
president said i saw a story about that but i cannot attest 
to it i havent looked into it yet

sen patrick leahy chairman of the senate 
agriculture committee delayed action on the commodities section of 
the 1990 farm bill tuesday after fellow democrats opposed his 
strategy to appease republicans 
meanwhile the house agriculture committee met in closed session 
on the conservation section of its farm bill trying to settle 
disputes between environmentalists and farmers 
sen bob kerrey dneb who led the drafting of the original 
democratic commodities proposals said the bill leahy and ranking 
republican sen richard lugar created for committee markup sounded 
more like a republican bill than a democratic one 
were in the majority kerrey said what we were saying to 
the chairman was you should vote the democratic proposal 
the dispute between the democrats and leahy became obvious when 
a morning session scheduled for a vote was so poorly attended that 
leahy decided to cancel it 
leahy said in a statement that he didnt agree with all parts of 
the bill he was putting on the table but that it represents the 
basis of a bipartisan compromise on commodities 
during markup sessions committee members can radically change 
legislation through amendments but kerrey said the minority 
republicans should be the ones trying to amend the proposals not 
the democrats 
lugar has threatened to cause trouble for the democrats on the 
floor if the committee doesnt approve a bill that freezes target 
prices loan rates and acreage reduction levels and omits budget 
gimmicks 
i disagree strongly with the loan rate freeze kerrey said 
adding that there was room for compromise in the other areas 
loan rates determine the amount of support the government will 
give farmers to assure they have enough money to plant crops 
kerrey wants government support tied to production costs as a way 
of protecting small and medium farms 
lugar is saying if you dont give me 100 percent im going to 
make life miserable kerrey said 
its a tough choice for the chairman lugar said after leahy 
called off the markup session if he goes with the democrats he 
would have rather creative and vigorous opposition on the floor 
leahy said he wanted to postpone a vote until he corresponded 
with agriculture secretary clayton yeutter about a letter yeutter 
sent him tuesday 
but lugar who had asked yeutter to write the letter to 
articulate the administrations position on the farm bill said 
leahy was using it as an excuse to delay

sen daniel p moynihan denounced tuesday the 
tough guy talk used by national drug policy director william 
bennett last week in a verbal attack on new york gov mario cuomo 
i have to say that if a year ago i had any reason to suppose 
that dr bennett would use his office in this manner i would have 
taken whatever measures necessary to see that he was not confirmed 
for it moynihan dny said in remarks submitted to the 
congressional record 
bennett in albany ny last thursday to meet with state drug 
officials attacked cuomos drug fighting record and challenged the 
democrat to run for president 
nobodys afraid of this guy bennett said hes got a 
record to run on and the record on drugs i have to tell you is 
not what it should be 
moynihan expressed surprise tuesday at bennetts choice of words 
how does such a man come to refer to the governor of the state 
of new york as this guy moynihan asked we recognize the 
idiom it is socalled toughguy talk it can be learned from 
hollywood movies also from detective novels 
bennett declined to respond to the toughguy remark 
according to spokesman don hamilton 
we really dont have a lot to say on this hamilton said 
his substantive criticisms have been made before and theyve been 
responded to before 
last week rep charles rangel dny rushed to defend cuomo 
and strike back at bennett he said the drug policy director could 
not point to any successful program that has brought the nation 
closer to solving its drug problems 
rangel is chairman of the house select committee on narcotics 
abuse and control

attorney general dick thornburgh will have a 
reserved seat at a savings and loan fraud hearing even though he 
hasnt responded to an invitation to testify the chairman of a 
house panel said tuesday 
rep frank annunzio dill said his house banking subcommittee 
on financial institutions had received no reply to a may 25 letter 
offering thornburgh his choice of three hearing dates 
fbi director william webster and assistant attorney general 
edward dennis already have testified about the administrations 
efforts to combat financial institution fraud thornburgh has not 
justice department spokesman douglas tillett said thornburgh may 
have had a conflict with annunzios proposed hearing dates he said 
thornburgh would testify when it is appropriate 
i will not deny the attorney general an opportunity to appear 
if he so chooses even at the last minute annunzio said there 
will be a chair and a nameplate at the witness table at the june 
28 hearing 
congressional democrats in recent weeks have stepped up their 
criticism of the bush administration complaining of a backlog of 
uninvestigated fraud cases 
the administration in turn has pointed to a growing list of 
convictions and its 50 million program to establish fraud task 
forces in 27 cities

climbing the corporate ladder can plunge some 
people into depression but an early diagnosis could spare middle 
managers a serious case of the office blues researchers said 
tuesday 
a study of 1870 whitecollar employees of westinghouse electric 
corp in monroeville a pittsburgh suburb showed 166 percent of 
female and 86 percent of male managers were clinically depressed 
in the year prior to the survey which was taken in 1987 and 1988 
the figures exceed the latest depression rate for all americans 
44 percent in 1986 according to the national institute of mental 
health 
the bottom line for you is that depression is eminently 
treatable said dr david kupfer chairman of the psychiatry 
department at the university of pittsburgh the research findings 
were presented to about 100 personnel directors healthinsurance 
managers and corporate doctors at a conference on mental health 
thirtysix percent of female and 23 percent of male westinghouse 
managers qualified as clinically depressed at some point during 
their lives the study said 
according to the american psychiatric association a person 
suffers from major depression when he or she shows at least five of 
the following symptoms within a twoweek period irregular sleeping 
patterns irregular eating habits recurrent thoughts of suicide or 
death depressed mood loss of interest or pleasure in daily 
activities significant weight loss or gain agitated or retarded 
movements feelings of worthlessness or guilt and lack of 
concentration 
at least one of the symptoms must be a depressed mood or loss of 
interest or pleasure the apa says 
herbert freudenberger a new york city psychologist and 
consultant to companies on whitecollar stress and depression said 
the westinghouse study is significant because it marks the first 
time a large company allowed such an examination of its workers 
westinghouse employs about 120000 people worldwide 
midlevel managers often are depressed because they find 
themselves trapped between the gripes of their subordinates and 
demands of their own bosses he said 
the firstline managers are the ones who get hell from over 
them and hell from under them said dr e carroll curtis 
westinghouses medical director 
pitt and westinghouse interviewed the managers most of whom 
were white males under a grant from the national institute of 
mental health 
the most common causes of depression at work were lack of 
rewards a cloudy job future and specific events such as pay cuts 
or bad evaluations the study said 
the most common cause of depression at home was a spouse with a 
history of psychiatric disorders the study said 
mark kamlet an economics professor at carnegie mellon 
university estimated that depressionrelated absenteeism lost 
wages hospital costs prescriptions and suicides will cost the 
us economy 369 billion in 1990 
researchers said companies could train more executives and 
managers to spot depressions symptoms and tactfully address the 
illness with employees 
the westinghouse study said although depression usually can be 
treated without hospitalization 70 percent of the depressed 
managers didnt seek treatment 
its not preferred procedure for a manager to turn himself in 
to any psychologist kamlet said 
particularly with males someone will tell you to buck up and 
take a few shots of beer then youll be all right said jim 
jefferson 43 a mellon bank building manager who recently returned 
to work after treatment for depression but he said it doesnt 
work that way

jury selection ground through a seventh day 
tuesday in mayor marion barrys drug and perjury trial while top 
barry aides said anew that he would announce he was abandoning his 
reelection plans 
he will do it but the only question left is when said one 
top barry adviser speaking only on condition of anonymity were 
all just waiting 
the mayor was meeting with his staff late tuesday but city 
officials said they expected only a routine discussion of city 
affairs 
barry told his top advisers and fundraisers at a meeting sunday 
that he would give up his plans for a fourth fouryear term 
several aides said the mayor was making that move in hopes of 
restarting stalled plea bargain talks in his drug case 
in courtroom proceedings tuesday 10 more people were assigned 
to a pool of prospective jurors by us district court judge thomas 
penfield jackson that brought to 68 the number of people accepted 
for the pool from which 12 jurors and six alternates are to be 
chosen 
one woman included in the pool said she attended church three 
times a week and that she prayed for barry 
she also works in the city department of human services but 
said she didnt know any of the more than 50 potential witnesses in 
the case those on the list include david rivers the former human 
services department chief who is now on trial for alleged bribery 
and conspiracy in connection with city contracts the judge said he 
was unable to conclude the woman was lying he said also that her 
prayers for the defendant were not inconsistent with her assurances 
that she could be a fair and impartial juror 
barry has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine possession 
charges one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge and three 
felony counts of lying to a grand jury about his alleged drug use 
the judge has said he expects jury selection which began june 
4 to continue through this week

mikhail s gorbachev moved to hold together a 
splintering soviet union on tuesday by proposing the 15 republics 
agree on a new looser federation of sovereign states officials 
said 
the presidents of lithuania and latvia emerged smiling from two 
meetings with gorbachev and indicated it could be the beginning of 
a solution to the countrys problems with its restive republics 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis hinted gorbachev might 
soon end the economic embargo against his republic which declared 
independence from the soviet union on march 11 
by redefining the soviet federation gorbachev could deal with 
the three baltic republics demands for independence as well as 
lesser separatist moves across the vast country 
on tuesday those problems heightened when russias parliament 
led by gorbachev rival boris yeltsin approved a resolution 
declaring its laws supercede the national ones this could 
drmatically reduce gorbachevs authority because the russian 
republic includes 52 percent of the soviet unions population and 
threequarters of its land mass 
latvia came away from tuesdays meetings in the kremlin with an 
offer from the soviet president on starting negotiations toward 
independence according to latvian president anatoly gorbunov 
at a moscow press conference with gorbunov landsbergis implied 
that gorbachev also offered his republic a compromise on 
independence but he refused to elaborate saying he would tell the 
people of lithuania first 
asked if gorbachev would end his embargo of lithuania which has 
put 26000 people out of work landsbergis replied the blockade 
will not be canceled tomorrow but the day after tomorrow we shall 
see 
gorbachev ordered the blockade of oil most natural gas and 
other raw materials to lithuania on april 18 because it declared 
independence latvia and estonia the other baltic republics have 
proceded with slower transition periods toward independence which 
they lost when annexed in 1940 
estonian president arnold ruutel said on republic radio tuesday 
night that gorbachev had recognized the need for talks and a 
transition period toward independence neme brus of estonian radio 
said without elaboration 
the russian parliament approved its resolution declaring 
sovereignty by a 90713 vote the statement was weaker than 
originally proposed however because it says sovereignty and 
priority of its laws over national ones will be worked out in a new 
russian constitution and a new union 
gorbachev told the presidents of all 15 soviet republics in a 
separate meeting tuesday to nominate representatives and prepare 
drafts for a union that would have elements of a federation a 
confederation or some such pluralistic relationship said 
landsbergis 
he said lithuania would consider this 
earlier tuesday gorbachev told the supreme soviet legislature 
if lithuania will suspend the implementation of this act of 
independence we may start to talk that means suspend its 
implementation at least for the duration of the talks 
the baltic officials met with gorbachev after participating in 
tuesdays meeting of gorbachevs advisory federation council where 
he offered ideas for a new type of soviet union as a union of 
sovereign states landsbergis said 
the official tass news agency said the federation council 
considered the urgent need to work out and conclude a new union 
treaty which will guarantee the actual economic and political 
sovereignty of the union republics and their effective 
interaction 
it continued by saying this would lead to a union of sovereign 
socialist republics adding the word socialist not mentioned 
by landsbergis 
the baltic republics have dropped the words soviet socialist 
from their names 
soviet television showed gorbachev telling the federation 
council it was time to find practical ways to realize the key 
idea of the deep revamping of our federation 
the news announcer said the soviet unions planned move to a 
market economy to help end widespread shortages and productivity 
problems should create mutually profitable relations between the 
republics and would help bind them together 
gorbachev has pledged repeatedly since fall to work out a new 
union treaty but this is the first sign of action 
gorbachev offered latvia immediate concrete negotiations on 
that republics legal status during its transition period to 
independence if it freezes its declaration for the duration of the 
negotiations gorbunov said 
gorbunov suggested that during the transition period latvias 
parliament would be considered sovereign in addition conflicts 
during this period over such issues as the conscription of latvians 
into the soviet army would be decided in separate agreements on 
the basis of equality 
he said the latvian parliament will consider gorbachevs offer 
on wednesday 
the federation council meeting also brought gorbachev 
facetoface with yeltsin for the first time since his rival and 
former protege was elected president of russia over gorbachevs 
opposition 
gorbunov said the two men both offered constructive suggestions 
and treated each other with respect 
earlier in the day gorbachev speaking to the supreme soviet 
pariament about his washington summit acknowledged that some 
americans opposed senate ratification of a ussoviet trade 
agreement signed during the summit until moscow grants 
independence to the group of lithuanian separatists 
but after i had contacts with the american people it turned 
out that such demands do not reflect the position of the entire 
united states gorbachev told parliament 
during an hourlong address and another hour of answers to 
written questions gorbachev did not mention that president bush 
said he would not implement the trade deal until the soviet 
parliament approves a draft law guaranteeing free emigration 
although soviet jews and other ethnic groups are leaving in 
record numbers the parliament last week adopted an agenda that 
delays the emigration law until at least september the parliament 
already has given the law preliminary approval

president mikhail s gorbachev shifted gears on 
tuesday and suggested a united germany could be an associate member 
of nato if the western alliance switches from its cold war position 
against the soviet union 
western diplomats said gorbachev appeared to be showing more 
flexibility on the german issue only days after he had again 
expressed soviet opposition to nato membership during the visit of 
britains prime minister margaret thatcher 
the president also told the supreme soviet legislature in his 
hourlong speech broadcast live on soviet tv that huge results 
were achieved in arms control at his may 30june 3 summit in 
washington with president bush 
the address gave gorbachev the opportunity to highlight his area 
of greatest success foreign policy as his domestic policy 
plagued by economic woes ethnic strife and secessionist strains 
draws increasing fire at home gorbachev smiling often and 
speaking calmly told the legislators his warm reception in the 
united states and the signing of a ussoviet trade agreement 
showed us faith in his domestic reform program 
he reported on his talks with bush on a united germany joining 
the north atlantic treat organization west germany now belongs to 
the western military alliance and east germany to the sovietled 
warsaw pact 
gorbachev said our position is thus we could agree to the 
joining if you accept associative participation the principle of 
blocs coming together in conjunction with the unification of 
germany in the process of which mutual obligations are not changed 
neither from the side of west or east germany and if 
simultaneously the blocs are reformed in natural connection with 
vienna and the alleuropean process 
he did not spell out what associate membership for germany would 
comprise vienna is the venue for arms reduction talks and the 
europewide conference on security and cooperation aimed at 
reducing tensions 
later official radio moscow said it might be possible to 
agree with germany being in nato as an associated member provided 
there are changes in the nature of the military alliances both 
nato and the warsaw treaty organization 
the kremlin up to now has sought membership in both nato and the 
warsaw pact for a united germany 
bush said in washington that a unified germany should be in 
nato with no conditions but said he was prepared to listen and 
discuss without rancor any ideas the soviets have on the issue 
he spoke in reply to reporters questions about gorbachevs speech 
the soviet president seemed to be demanding that a united 
germany fulfill east germanys obligations to the warsaw pact only 
during a transition period 
his comments appeared to signal positive movement on the 
german issue said one western diplomat speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the west german newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said monday that 
prime minister lothar de maiziere of east germany would carry a new 
gorbachev proposal to break the deadlock to a meeting with bush it 
said gorbachev would agree to nato membership for a united germany 
if the western alliance made a clear decision to transform itself 
into a political alliance 
gorbachev said tuesday of the summit as a whole i think huge 
results were achieved in washington toward limiting nuclear and 
conventional weapons 
all this has great meaning another practical step was taken 
to realize the idea of a nonviolent nonnuclear world 
he said hard work lies ahead but the cold war danger has begun 
to recede 
gorbachev and bush signed agreements to eliminate the two sides 
chemical weapons and to reach a final accord this year to cut 
deeply their strategic nuclear weapons

president joaquin 
balaguer made it just another day at the office tuesday without 
acknowledging that official results indicated he narrowly won a 
sixth term as president 
no rallies were held and no victory speeches were made following 
mondays declaration by the central electoral board that the 
83yearold blind balaguer had defeated 80yearold leftist 
challenger juan bosch by a margin of fewer than 25000 votes in the 
may 16 election 
a review of balloting results caused the almost monthlong delay 
in concluding the election results 
the board reported balaguer had received 678268 votes or 357 
percent to 653423 or 344 percent for bosch 
under dominican law balaguer will not be proclaimed 
presidentelect until the board rules on all vote challenges a 
process that took almost two months in the last four elections 
inauguration for a fouryear term is set for aug 16 
two opposition parties filed formal challenges with the board 
tuesday charging irregularities and fraud in the electoral 
process such challenges are routine in the dominican republic but 
are generally regarded as a technicality and rarely result in 
significant changes in the results 
boschs dominican liberation party called a meeting for 
wednesday evening to determine its course of action 
thousands of candles twinkled in workingclass neighborhoods in 
a symbol of protest after the boards figures were announced on 
television police arrested 140 people for disturbing the peace by 
lighting candles or chanting antibalaguer slogans but most 
detainees were quickly released 
the electoral board said 408 percent of the 32 million 
registered voters stayed home on election day the highest 
abstention figure in any election since dictator gen rafael 
leonidas trujillo was assassinated in 1961 
bosch a former president was overthrown by a military coup in 
1963 
balaguer was a figuerhead president during the 31year trujillo 
dictatorship he was first elected president in 1966 and served 
three consecutive terms before losing in 1978 he was reelected in 
1986 
he appeared to be in trouble before the election because of this 
caribbean island countrys economic crisis frequent electricity 
blackouts and water shortages opinion polls had bosch leading by 
up to 10 points 
bosch is a marxist but says he is not a communist and 
recognizes capitalism as necessary for reviving the dominican 
economy

at least half of algerias voters 
apparently heeded an election boycott call tuesday as the ruling 
party battled islamic fundamentalists in the first contested ballot 
since french rule ended in 1962 observers said 
a majority of district races appeared dominated by the national 
liberation front the nations sole political party until last 
years constitutional reforms 
the fundamentalist islamic salvation front the only other major 
party on the ballot benefitted by the withdrawal of several groups 
that urged a boycott 
official results were expected wednesday 
boycott leaders claimed the election was rigged in favor of the 
ruling party because it controls nearly all the media has greater 
resources than other parties and has its functionaries in local 
government offices where the votes will be counted 
charges of voterigging surfaced immediately after the polls 
closed at 7 pm 
the interior ministry said 55 percent of the 13 million eligible 
voters went to the polls but figures showed a considerable range 
from 73 percent in the town of eltarf to 16 percent in the berber 
town of tiziouzou 
fifteen thousand seats were contested in this north african 
nations 1541 municipal councils and 48 provinces in all 11 
parties were on the ballot 
hocine ait ahmed leader of the opposition berber movement the 
front of socialist forces and former president ahmed ben bellas 
movement for democracy in algeria led the boycott effort 
police were deployed throughout the country as the official 
media urged algerians to vote in this first test of democracy 
fundamentalist leader abassi madani a philosophy teacher 
predicted several days ago his party would capture 75 percent of 
the vote he challenged the legitimacy of the election in advance 
if the result failed to reflect this figure 
the statement was denounced as a troublemaking provocation 
by several hundred fellow university professors and lecturers 
for months fundamentalist supporters have been accused of 
harrassing single women and disrupting nightclubs in the algiers 
region prompting denunciations from most political groups 
in the algiers suburb of el harrach the national liberation 
front withdrew from the elections accusing the fundamentalists of 
exercising moral violence against the voters and committing 
serious violations against the election law the statement did 
not elaborate 
the official news agency reported several groups of islamic 
supporters tried to overrun some algiers voting stations alleging 
the vote counting was influenced by the government 
numerous voters in the algiers district were turned away from 
polling booths when they appeared without the necessary documents 
among those blocked were men who tried to exercise their right to 
vote on behalf of their wife or wives without written 
authorization 
the national liberation fronts was forced to give up its 
monopoly on power after soldiers killed scores of people in october 
1988 riots sparked by deteriorating economic conditions 
constitutional changes adopted in february 1989 legalized pluralism 
the islamic salvation front seeks to establish the islamic legal 
code the sharia as law and openly opposes the democratic process

congress has been unable to agree on 
comprehensive oil spill legislation over provisions on ship 
construction and liability two problems exemplified in the wreck 
of a norwegian supertanker officials said tuesday 
since 1975 congress has struggled to create a liability and 
response law that covers the estimated 8000 oil spills that occur 
in the united states annually 
galvanized by the exxon valdez accident both the house and 
senate last fall passed sweeping legislation but the approximately 
100 members of a housesenate conference committee have met only 
once to resolve differences in the bills 
last weekend the supertanker mega borg caught fire 57 miles 
from galveston and since then firefighters have struggled to bring 
the fire under control 
the fire prompted members of congress on tuesday in calling for 
conferees to step up the pace 
once again the need to prevent these spills is made all too 
clear said sen brock adams 
the bill creates a 1 billion cleanup fund through a 5cent tax 
on each barrel of oil created in or imported to the united states 
it also establishes coast guard oil spill response centers along 
us coasts 
but the house and senate disagree on requiring supertankers to 
have double hulls and using international protocol to guide 
liability in a spill 
congressional staff members say conferees are close to resolving 
the double hull issue but international protocol and its 
relationship to state liability laws has tripped up oil spill 
legislation for the past seven congresses officials say 
senators led by majority leader george mitchell say liability 
limits set by international protocol arent strict enough 
they see it rightly as a back door attempt to preempt state 
laws said mike matz of the sierra club nineteen states require 
unlimited liability for the oil companies or carriers to clean up 
damage to the environment 
international protocols provide up to 260 million from an 
international compensation fund before any us dollars are spent 
on an cleanup say house backers 
and they must be in place for the united states to hold foreign 
vessels liable for spills that could affect us water they say 
currently the norwegian owners of the mega borg could walk away 
from liability for damage the wreck causes the us shoreline 
because the fire occurred in international waters 
were living on the good graces of the norwegians right now 
said rep billy tauzin dla a house conferee and proponent of 
the international protocol i hope this incident drives the 
senate to reconsider 
but mitchell said full compensation for catastrophic spills 
cannot be obtained from international protocol limits 
he said the house version for instance would have limited 
exxons liability for last years alaskan spill to less than 60 
million damage from the valdez spill is estimated to be more than 
2 billion said mitchell dmaine 
exxons victims could not have obtained more than 260 million 
from the international regime and 1 billion from the federal trust 
fund if this bill had been enacted mitchell said of the house 
version 
but rep jack fields who flew over the mega borg fire monday 
said the accident clearly begs for acceptance of international 
protocols 
states like maine want to punish the shippers said fields 
rtexas they want to be able to squeeze as much blood from the 
turnip as possible rather than make those who have been damaged 
whole 
the house bill requires new oil tankers to have double hulls and 
existing tankers to be retrofitted in 15 years the senate 
recommends study of double hulls or better means to prevent oil 
spills

a former fbi agent who solved a yearold 
homicide by confessing to the crime pleaded guilty tuesday to 
strangling a pregnant informant with whom hed been having an 
affair he was sentenced to 16 years in prison 
in a signed confession mark putnam said he choked susan daniels 
smith 27 on june 8 1989 in an act of extreme rage while the 
couple arued over support of her expected child 
putnam 30 of sunrise fla entered a guilty plea to one count 
of felony manslaughter in ms smiths death 
immediately after the hearing putnam was handcuffed and taken 
into custody by kentucky state police officers 
it was apparently the first case in fbi history in which an 
agent had been charged with a homicide said terry oconnor the 
fbis top agent in kentucky 
as far as the fbi is concerned this is a difficult day 
but i would hope that our entire record is whats going to 
govern the way that people think about the fbi oconnor said 
the victims family expressed outrage they were not consulted in 
the drafting of putnams plea bargain they had wanted him to stand 
trial for murder 
the victims sister shelby ward of freeburn was cited for 
trying to conceal a 38caliber handgun in the courtroom by 
kentucky state police and was released 
putnam appeared tense during his 20minute appearance in pike 
county circuit court 
putnam who resigned friday worked in pikeville for about two 
years until his transfer to miami in may 1989 he used ms smith as 
an informant in a bank robbery and car theft case 
putnams confession was attached to an indictment returned 
tuesday by the pike county grand jury in the statement he 
recalled a bitter violent argument with ms smith about her 
pregnancy putnam had returned to pikeville for several days to 
work a car theft case he had investigated 
ms smith kept telling me the baby was mine and that she was 
going to hang me over this she said she would tell the fbi my 
family and the newspapers putnams statement said 
the couple was driving on a rural eastern kentucky highway at 
the time and pulled off the road at peter creek mountain putnam 
said he and his wife would adopt the child but ms smith refused 
and began slapping putnam 
the agent recalled that in an act of extreme rage i 
started choking her and telling her to shut up putnam said he 
tried in vain to revive her 
he said he placed the body in the trunk of his rented car and 
dumped it the following evening off an old coal mine road about 
nine miles north of pikeville 
prosecutor john paul runyon the pike county commonwealths 
attorney said that without putnams june 4 confession we had 
absolutely no evidence not one scintilla or shred of evidence to 
bring a charge or convict this man 
in the 28 years that i have been a prosecutor this is the 
first experience that i have had where a lawyer called me on a 
telephone and said i have a man who wants to confess to murder or 
homicide and wants to go to the penitentiary and we had 
absolutely no evidence runyon added

sen dave durenberger has brought dishonor 
and disrepute on the senate and should be denounced by his 
colleagues for engaging in unethical conduct the senate ethics 
committees special counsel recommended tuesday 
robert s bennetts recommendation was a surprise on the opening 
day of the panels hearings into durenbergers alleged financial 
improprieties bennett called the minnesota republicans conduct 
reprehensible 
durenberger in a written statement said the sanction of 
denouncement is harsher than warranted the senator who 
appeared stunned as bennett made his recommendation later admitted 
in a written statement that he had made mistakes and even some 
violations of rules and his lawyer conceded some penalty was 
appropriate but durenberger contended his actions were taken in 
good faith 
bennett said the evidence showed a pattern of unethical 
conduct by durenberger in a bookpromotion deal transactions 
involving his minneapolis condominium and his acceptance of free 
limousine rides 
your loyalty here is not to sen durenberger bennett told 
the committee 
durenberger sat with his hand on his cheek as bennett pointed 
out to the sixmember committee that they sat under a senate seal 
sen durenberger has tarnished that seal and has brought this 
institution to dishonor and disrepute the counsel said your 
loyalty to this institution now summons you to denounce this 
senator and his actions 
only the full senate can decide to punish a member if the 
chamber eventually followed the counsels recommendation it would 
pass a resolution denouncing durenbergers conduct an action that 
would have greater consequences for the senator politically than 
for his position as a senator which would not be affected 
bennett reminded the panel it could consider stripping 
durenberger of his seniority and committee assignments as well as 
ordering restitution but he did not recommend such actions 
he also said the most serious punishment expulsion has been 
reserved for senators who violate the law and shouldnt apply in 
this case 
durenbergers lawyer jim hamilton told the hearing 
what we have is mistakes and sloppiness sanction such as 
denouncement is simply not appropriate 
he told the committee that durenberger relied on a bevy of 
lawyers in all his financial transactions and there were no 
venal motives or a grand conspiracy to violate the rules 
senator durenberger feels that some sanction is appropriate 
because he was inattentive and unwise hamilton said but the 
attorney did not specify any punishment the lowest form of 
punishment would be a mild letter of rebuke 
bennett who earlier told the committee that durenberger 
exhibited very serious insensitivity to the ethical demands of 
his office told senators they should denounce sen durenberger 
publicly for knowingly engaging in unethical conduct which has 
brought dishonor and disrepute to this institution 
the hearing took on the aura of a trial as the 12year senator 
stared from across the room when bennett standing at a lectern 
accused durenberger of making fake promotional appearances in 1985 
and 1986 for his two books 
the speeches were really a gimmick to magically turn 
honoraria earned from appearances before trade groups into book 
promotions allowing durenberger to make 100000 beyond his senate 
salary and exceed the chambers speakingfee limits bennett said 
the scheme was concocted bennett said as the senator neared 
the legal maximum for honoraria 
bennett said durenbergers attempts to change ownership of his 
minneapolis condominium was a scheme to improperly collect 40055 
in senate travel reimbursements from 1983 through 1989 he would 
not have been eligible for the payments if he had owned the 
residence outright bennett said 
the senator consistently engaged in a pattern of unethical 
conduct and showed very serious insensitivity to the ethical 
demands of his office bennett told the sixmember committee 
about 200 spectators attended the first of the hearings which 
the committee will use to determine if durenberger broke the 
chambers rules and federal law 
the panel has found substantial credible evidence that 
durenberger may have committed violations in the condominium deal 
the book arrangement and the limousine trips 
if the panel finds wrongdoing it can recommend that the senate 
punish durenberger by handing out anything from a mild rebuke to 
expulsion although the latter is unlikely 
in his book deal durenberger received 100000 from a 
minneapolis publisher piranha press in return for addressing 
trade groups that sent their speaking fees to piranha 
durenberger contended the speeches were made to promote books 
but bennett said the real purpose was for the senator to collect 
honoraria in excess of senate limits 22530 in 1985 and 30040 
in 1986 
this very hungry fish piranha press was allowed to engage in 
a feeding frenzy to make money bennett said durenberger he 
added allowed himself and his office to be used as the bait and 
he got 100000 for his trouble 
the scheme made a large profit for piranha which earned 
248360 from durenbergers speeches and only 15560 from the sale 
of books 
in calling the book arrangement a scam bennett told the 
committee that in the 113 appearances being investigated the host 
groups thought they were hearing a typical honoraria speech some 
of the groups strenuously objected when they learned 
durenbergers speech was classified as a book promotion and 
withdrew the invitation 
in addition bennett said the two books durenberger wrote on 
national security and health issues were displayed at only three of 
the 113 appearances at one appearance durenberger commented 
this is a book but what it really is is 44 speeches compiled 
into a book 
in describing the complicated condominium deal bennett said 
durenberger wouldnt have been able to collect senate travel 
reimbursements if he had owned the residence 
so durenberger schemed not once but twice to have business 
partnerships take ownership and lease the condominium back to him 
when he stayed there thus allowing senate travel expenses to be 
paid 
when the original partner decided to end the initial partnership 
in 1987 four years after it was formed durenberger entered into a 
similar arrangement year with his former campaign manager 
bennett also said durenberger showed a pattern of 
insensitivity when he accepted free limousine rides on 21 
occasions in 1985 and 1986 from groups and individuals interested 
in legislation 
durenberger has said the rides were to his marriage counselor 
and were arranged in conjunction with official appearances 
a senator could accept only up to 100 in gifts from those with 
an interest in legislation bennett said the limousine rides were 
valued at 4935

crews from a company named oops brought 
in equipment from all over to be ready to collect and contain oil 
from the crippled supertanker mega borg once the flames on board 
were smothered 
im confident that weve got the pieces of equipment that we 
need here now and im confident that weve explored where we can 
get other pieces if needed jim obrien president of oops inc 
said tuesday oops stands for obriens oil pollution services of 
gretna la 
oops was hired by elf a houston subsidiary of the french oil 
distribution company whose oil the mega borg was carrying 
obrien was the technical adviser on the cleanup of the exxon 
valdez oil spill in alaska 
oops has brought in booms skimmers and water separators from 
the gulf coast and california other equipment was to arrive within 
24 hours from the northeast 
obrien said his company has no equipment of its own 
coast guard capt thomas greene said tuesday that although the 
tanker fire had eased were still not completely safe from a 
major release of oil 
but he added that there is not a great chance of any oil 
coming ashore because the light african crude is likely to break up 
and evaporate 
obrien said his company had enough equipment to handle a major 
spill 
oops first priority will be to right the 886foot ship to 
prevent further spillage crews then will begin transferring oil to 
smaller ships and pumping water into the mega borgs emptying cargo 
tanks to keep her steady 
the coast guard on tuesday revised its estimate of the amount of 
oil on the water to less than 2000 gallons a fraction of the 
100000 gallons estimated earlier much oil had either burned off 
or evaporated officials said 
the length of the slick on the water continued to shrink 
officials said 
the amount that spilled from the norwegian tanker which was 
carrying 38 million gallons was not determined 
the rear of the mega borg dropped more than 60 feet since the 
tanker caught fire early saturday while transferring cargo to a 
smaller vessel two of the 41 crewmen died two were missing and 
presumed dead and 17 were injured none seriously 
airplane crews have sprayed dispersants to break up the heavier 
oil patches and remained ready to spray more if needed greene said

city police warned record stores tuesday to 
stop selling the controversial album as nasty as they wanna be 
by rap group 2 live crew or face possible obscenity charges 
theres no prior restraint were just asking for voluntary 
compliance said lt jerry pittman commander of the vice squad 
in about five days police will begin conducting undercover 
investigations and arresting anyone still selling the album 
pittman said 
unfortunately when something like that occurs the clerk that 
sells the record is often the one that gets arrested he said 
i dont think the business owners want that 
pittman said bexar county assistant district attorney mike 
schill reviewed transcripts of the album lyrics and listened to 
them on tape before determining that some words violate state 
obscenity law 
however schill reached later by telephone would say only that 
the lyrics in question could violate state obscenity law 
i have my opinion but my opinion doesnt count schill 
said its what the jury or the judge think schill said his 
role would be to decide whether to prosecute a case if police bring 
him one 
but he added i think the federal judge in florida was 
correct which was that its obscene 
in florida last week us district judge jose gonzalez ruled 
material on the album obscene under that states law on sunday 
two 2 live crew members were arrested on obscenity charges after 
performing the banned lyrics at an adultsonly nightclub concert 
two days earlier a recordstore owner was arrested on an obscenity 
charge for selling the album 
the groups attorney bruce rogow said he filed an appeal 
monday with the 11th us circuit court of appeals in atlanta 
pittman said we believe that it is obscene as well in the 
state of texas adding that the album describes deviant sexual 
intercourse and is inundated with obscene language 
state law requires that someone convicted of selling obscene 
material be aware that it is obscene pittman said he said 
officers are diplomatically going to about 84 local stores to 
explain what the album contains and added were getting 
compliance 
sound warehouse stores in san antonio removed the records 
tuesday to comply with the law said branch manager mark christy 
who had a note from vice detectives saying the records contain 
obscene lyrics 
im glad to see that theyre doing it christy said im 
not one of the people for censorship but i think this music is 
ridiculous 
greta colvin manager of a hastings records and tapes said 
local stores in that chain also are removing the albums but said 
she disagrees with police 
ms colvin said officers came to her store tuesday and asked her 
to sign a statement that she had been informed the lyrics violate 
obscenity laws she said she told them that hastings rates albums 
and that any rated r may not be purchased by people under 18 
but the officers didnt seem to care 
its censorship she said if someone comes out with 
another song that somebody with a political influence finds 
offensive theyre going to come around again 
pittman said hed hoped to keep the police action out of the 
limelight at first to avoid publicityboosted sales 
the penalty for conviction of selling obscene material in texas 
a class a misdemeanor can be up to a year in jail and a 2000 
fine 
2 live crew is to perform in huntsville ala on saturday city 
attorney clyde blankenship said some lyrics on the album appear to 
violate the local obscenity ordinance which the city council on 
monday night expanded to include live performances 
a local pastor threatened to block off the concert center with 
a human ring if the group is allowed to perform but the 
council said it could not block the performance which the bands 
promoter eddison walters said would be appropriate for kids

a woman who committed suicide by running 
her car in a closed garage also killed her two roommates 
apparently without intending to police said tuesday 
the body of ruth m goran 55 was found friday two days before 
her daughters wedding mrs goran was clad in a nightgown and was 
sitting in a car with the ignition on said sgt james flonacher 
inside her condominium claude r hillhouse 42 and gordon 
geer 32 were also dead both men were dressed with hillhouse in 
the living room and geer in the bathroom police said 
the same carbon monoxide fumes that took mrs gorans life had 
seeped into the condominium and killed the men flonacher said 
police are still unsure why mrs goran would want to kill 
herself but seemed that she did not intend for the two men to die 
there are absolutely no signs of foul play we are 
convinced the deaths were accidental flonacher said 
the bodies were found when the daughter karen mclaughlin went 
to her mothers house friday and called police when no one answered 
the door 
mrs mclaughlin 29 had come from las vegas on friday to be 
married she married jon mclaughlin 33 also of las vegas in a 
ceremony sunday 
we had the wedding because we knew mom wanted us to mrs 
mclaughlin said 
she said she had spoken to her mother earlier in the week 
she wasnt suicidal mrs mclaughlin said she was real 
happy we were looking forward to holding the reception at her 
home we were going to bring everything over friday night

the senate failed to muster a twothirds 
majority tuesday to override president bushs veto of legislation 
providing federal support for the amtrak passenger rail network 
the action kept bushs his streak of successful vetoes intact at 
11 
the 6436 vote to override on bushs 66th birthday was three 
votes shy of the twothirds majority needed bush had vetoed the 
measure last month because he objected to a requirement tightening 
regulation of freight railroad ownership and the house voted last 
week to override him 
republicans maintained that bush otherwise supported the 2 
billion amtrak authorization provisions even though his and the 
reagan administration before him have routinely proposed an end to 
federal subsidies for rail passenger service 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine voted to 
sustain the veto in a parliamentary move aimed at giving democrats 
another shot at overriding the president only a member of the 
winning side may ask that a vote be reconsidered and mitchell 
promptly did so giving the democrats time to try to switch votes 
another vote was not immediately scheduled 
the other 54 democrats in the senate voted for the override 
they were joined by 10 of the 45 republicans 
the vote shows that we obviously had the strength said 
white house spokesman steve hart earlier white house officials 
had predicted a close vote 
sen robert w kasten jr rwis noted that a bill without the 
objectionable part has already been introduced in the house and 
later sen conrad burns rmont introduced a similar bill in the 
senate 
the fight is not over the funding of amtrak said kasten 
who lead the republican debate hart at the white house added if 
they send us the bill without the icc provision hell sign it 
it was bushs first veto of 1990 he returned 10 bills to 
congress last year none of them had been overridden 
the bill authorizes government subsidies for the passenger rail 
system for three years it also includes a provision that allows 
planning for a commuter line between washington dc and northern 
virginia suburbs 
bush vetoed the bill may 24 over a requirement that the 
interstate commerce commission which regulates railroads must 
approve any acquisition of a major freight line by a company not in 
the railroad business the commission already must approve the 
acquisition of one railroad by another 
bush called it an unwarranted regulatory roadblock to the 
financial restructuring of the railroad industry 
but sen paul simon dill and other midwestern lawmakers said 
that without closing that regulatory loophole thousands of miles 
of track could be ripped up and be sold off to repay the debt 
incurred in a buyout 
the presidents veto is wrong in terms of passenger traffic in 
this nation simon said it is infinitely wrong in terms of the 
icc approval 
what we want to avoid is a situation where people come in and 
buy the railroad and then just dismember it he said 
sen j james exon dneb argued that republicans should put 
national interest over concerns with a favor for bush 
i hope that we can get back not to whats nice for the party 
but what is right for america he said overriding this veto is 
certainly right for america and its transportation needs 
in the house vote last week 58 republicans joined 236 democrats 
for the override the vote against was 123 it was the first 
successful override vote in either chamber in the bush 
administration however a successful override requires a 
twothirds majority in both chambers

israeli troops pursuing palestinian 
stonethrowers fired tear gas into a un clinic in gaza city on 
tuesday and 66 infants and toddlers were treated for inhaling the 
fumes the army said 
in jerusalem a 17yearold jewish seminary student going to 
prayers at the western wall was stabbed twice in the stomach he 
was reported in fair condition at a jerusalem hospital 
police immediately rounded up 100 palestinians for questioning 
meanwhile the army demolished the homes of three palestinian 
families and sealed three others in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip members of the families were accused of throwing firebombs 
or killing arabs suspected of collaborating with israel the army 
said 
the house demolitions came on the first working day of prime 
minister yitzhak shamirs new rightwing government which has 
pledged to uproot the 30monthold palestinian uprising in the 
occupied territories 
since the rebellion against the israeli occupation began in 
december 1987 717 palestinians have been killed by israeli 
soldiers or civilians 
an additional 221 palestinians have been slain by fellow arabs 
most on suspicion of collaborating with israeli authorities 
fortyfive israelis have died in the violence 
an army official said the tear gas was fired into the uns 
rimal health center in gaza after an army patrol came under a 
barrage of stones and blocks he said the rocks were thrown from 
the clinic compound 
the official said on condition of anonymity that soldiers are 
barred from firing tear gas into enclosed spaces he said troops 
involved in tuesdays incident would be punished 
late tuesday a local military commander sentenced a reserve 
captain to 10 days of hard labor for the incident an army 
spokesman said 
officials of the un relief and works agency which runs the 
clinic said the incident began when about six israelis in civilian 
clothes ran into the building apparently in pursuit of palestinian 
boys who had stoned their car 
when army jeeps pulled up outside they came under a hail of 
stones the officials said 
dr zihni wahidi director of the clinic said there were about 
200 pregnant women and babies inside the building when the tear gas 
was fired 
he said many babies were overcome by gas most were treated at 
the clinic and some were taken to nasser hospital he said 
the army said 66 children were affected by the tear gas and 
doctors at nearby nasser hospital said they treated 58 youngsters 
between the ages of 1 month and 3 years they said 16 of those were 
admitted 
a un relief agency spokesman rolf van oye said a complaint 
would be filed with the israeli military government 
the victim in the stabbing in jerusalems old city was 
identified as yosef edri 17 in an interview on israel radio edri 
said his assailant carried a big sword and a pocket knife and 
stabbed him with both 
after the stabbing police forced scores of arabowned shops to 
close 
the western wall where edri was going to pray is the remnant 
of the ancient jewish temple destroyed by the romans in 70 ad and 
is regarded as judaisms holiest site 
the palestinian homes that were demolished were in the village 
of yatta and the jalazoun refugee camp in the west bank and the 
khan yunis refugee camp in gaza the army said those sealed were 
all in the west bank it said 
the israeli information center for human rights in the occupied 
territories said a total of 293 palestinian houses have been 
destroyed and 173 sealed for security offenses since the uprising 
began 
the us government and human rights groups have opposed house 
demolitions and sealings saying they constitute collective 
punishment

sunny skies tuesday raised hopes that patchup 
work might begin on the cruise liner bermuda stars torn hull but 
choppy seas delayed the effort to contain thousands of gallons of 
oil within the ship 
winds reaching 35 mph whipped up waves around the liner in 
buzzards bay prompting divers to suspend their survey of the hull 
the coast guard said 
with the waves so high the diver could be thrown into the 
hull said chief warrant officer tom blair at the marine safety 
office in providence ri 
he has to watch what hes doing very carefully and he cant 
use the video camera so the whole survey is being slowed up 
blair added 
its nice and sunny out there today but those winds are still 
pretty strong he said its great weather for sailing but not 
for something like this 
the coast guard said that john neary who was piloting the 
bermuda star when it ran aground sunday also had been piloting the 
cartransport vessel hual ingrita in february when it ran aground 
on jamestown island ri in narragansett bay 
but the coast guard determined that a failed steering mechanism 
caused the earlier accident cmdr larry doyle executive officer 
of the marine safety office told a news conference 
the cause of the bermuda star accident remained under 
investigation 
neary of the northeast pilots association in newport ri was 
brought aboard the liner to guide it through local waters the 
coast guard said 
drug tests of neary the bermuda stars captain and several 
other officers were not complete tuesday 
doyle said a container with a urine sample from neary broke en 
route to a philadelphia laboratory and that another sample would 
be taken tuesday he said the delay would not hamper tests for 
potential substance abuse because traces remain in the body for 
several weeks 
the bermuda star carrying more than 1060 passengers and crew 
ran aground in dense fog sunday morning on a rocky ledge off 
falmouth the vessel was freed that night and towed to anchor 
about three miles away 
the accident ripped a 90by2foot hole in the ships hull 
exposing tanks holding about 110000 gallons of fuel the coast 
guard said 
about 7500 gallons spilled and 500 gallons to 1000 gallons 
washed ashore on naushon island at the eastern end of buzzards bay 
workers began cleaning the oil tuesday in an effort expected to 
take about two weeks the island sparsely inhabited at the time 
becomes crowded during the summer 
no additional oil was leaking from the liner doyle said a 
small sheen trailing off the rear of the ship was thought to be oil 
clinging to its waterline and would be cleaned when seas calmed he 
said adding that water pressure should keep more oil from leaking 
coast guard officials decided against unloading the fuel to a 
barge before towing the liner to dry dock because of the heavy seas 
rear adm richard rybacki said he was disappointed by how long 
it took for the necessary equipment to get to the accident scene 
i would like to have seen a quicker response on sunday when we 
had good weather he said 
rybacki said coast guard personnel responded as quickly as 
possible but that the coast guard has only firstaid equipment 
and must rely on commercial contractors for help in serious spills 
relatively small booms were placed around the bermuda star 
within two hours of its grounding larger booms were supplied seven 
to eight hours later

three buildings 40 wall st the crown building and herald center

two environmental groups have filed a 
lawsuit to prevent the restart of the savannah river nuclear 
weapons plant on the grounds it would violate the federal clean 
water act an attorney said tuesday 
the lawsuit was filed monday in us district court in columbia 
by the natural resources defense council and the energy research 
foundation 
the groups charge that hot water discharges from one of three 
reactors scheduled to restart in december would exceed temperature 
limits set by the 1972 clean water act 
the discharges would send scalding water into the small streams 
adjacent to the plant said jimmy chandler attorney for the energy 
research foundation 
this hot water discharge will wipe out virtually all aquatic 
life and all vegetation within the receiving streams chandler 
said it will cause a loss of 10 to 12 acres of forested wetlands 
each year 
the reactor will discharge water at between 150 degrees and 170 
degrees while federal law prohibits hot water discharges of more 
than 90 degress he said 
us department of energy spokesman tim tomastik whose 
organization owns the savannah river site refused to comment on 
the lawsuit because the issue was in litigation the government has 
60 days to respond 
the reactors located near aiken near the georgia line were 
closed in 1988 after an accident at one unit raised questions about 
safety standards and the risk of mechanical failures more than 1 
billion is being spent to upgrade the reactors and retrain workers 
the plant produces tritium a radioactive isotope of hydrogen 
used to make hbombs tritiums decays at a rate of 55 percent a 
year meaning quantities in warheads must be replenished the 
government says its stockpile of tritium is running low although 
information about tritium inventories is classified 
in may energy secretary james d watkins announced a tentative 
schedule providing for the restart of the k reactor in december 
however a cooling tower that would lower the temperature of 
discharged water is not scheduled for completion until 1992 
the lawsuit filed monday asks that the k reactor not be operated 
until the cooling tower is completed 
restarting k reactor is unsafe and unnecessary said frances 
hart local coordinator of the energy research foundation a 
private nonprofit environmentalist group its time the 
government started obeying its own laws

nelson mandela met with top west 
german politicians on tuesday to argue for continued international 
sanctions against south africa but came away with no clear promises 
from helmut kohl 
mandela told reporters after his meeting with the west german 
chancellor that kohl had initially favored a review of sanctions 
when the european economic community meets this month in dublin 
but i think without speaking for him after listening to our 
argument he is now prepared to reconsider that was my distinct 
impression the deputy leader of the african national congress 
said 
mandela is on a tour of europe and north america to urge the 
west not to lift economic sanctions against the whiteled 
government in south africa 
some countries notably britain have said south african 
president fw de klerk should be rewarded for the steps he has 
taken toward ending the countrys system of racial discrimination 
those measures have included freeing mandela after nearly three 
decades in jail legalizing the black nationalist movement and 
engaging in a dialogue with black leaders including mandela 
mandela maintains it was only the persistence of the african 
national congress and the economic sanctions that prompted peace 
talks and that apartheid has not been completely dismantled 
without directly addressing the sanctions issue kohls office 
issued a statement saying the chancellor underscores the 
necessity for the quick and complete elimination of the existing 
apartheid structures and the full inclusion of all south africans 
in the political process 
mandela said his position was unequivocably endorsed by west 
german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher a member of a 
junior coalition partner in kohls government 
he is a strong supporter of the view that sanctions must be 
maintained said mandela who met with genscher for an hour 
tuesday morning 
in his meeting with kohl mandela said he also raised the issue 
of economic assistance from west germany to help with the 
repatriation of an expected 20000 returning exiles 
the european economic community of which west germany is an 
influential member agreed on a series of nonbinding measures 
against south africa in 1986 banning the imports of iron steel 
and gold coins worth 600 million in 1985 the eec also banned new 
investments in south africa 
although no agenda has yet been set the issue of sanctions is 
expected to come up next week at a meeting of community foreign 
ministers in luxembourg and at the full meeting later this month in 
dublin 
in february britain unilaterally lifted its ban on new 
investments in south africa 
mandela was freed from prison that month after 27 years in jail 
by the de klerk government

attempts to free an american miner kidnapped 
by south american guerrillas hit a snag when a gobetween brought 
the ransom in us dollars instead of colombian pesos the 
hostages father said tuesday 
the intermediary had problems getting up the river to the 
kidnappers because theyve had heavy rain and the river is 
swollen roy heimdal said 
then the guerrillas got upset because the ransom money came in 
us dollars instead of pesos when they tried to exchange it they 
had trouble finding enough pesos heimdal said so things 
arent going so smoothly 
heimdal said he and his wife marge had believed the kidnappers 
wanted 60000 in us currency in exchange for the freedom of 
their 27yearold son scott 
the heimdals traveled to chicago on tuesday with their 
daughters linda and angela to obtain passports so they can travel 
to quito ecuador when their son is released 
roy heimdal said the kidnappers also were upset after seeing 
coverage on cable news network of the familys effort last week to 
raise the ransom 
they saw pictures of our house heimdal said of the familys 
modest woodframe bungalow in a middleclass peoria neighborhood 
our house is no mansion but by their standards it is i guess 
they figure anyone who eats three square meals a day has 60000 
laying around 
heimdal said the unidentified intermediary was trying to 
convince the kidnappers the workingclass family really is 
financially strapped the familys life savings were wiped out by 
medical bills after mrs heimdal was seriously injured in a 1983 
wreck with an uninsured drunken driver 
there were no reports tuesday from ecuador 
heimdal said recent heavy rains there have swollen rivers 
making travel to the guerrillas jungle hideout difficult and 
slowing negotiations 
but the family has solved its own transportation problems 
heimdal said a florida travel agent has stepped forward to 
guarantee them passage to quito 
last week midway airlines donated two plane tickets to get the 
heimdals to miami but they did not have tickets to south america 
a woman who wants to remain anonymous called and offered us 
tickets the rest of the way heimdal said she said her 
daughter was kidnapped and murdered a few years ago and she wants 
to help us out she is arranging a flight to quito from miami 
heimdal said the family will stay in illinois until they receive 
word their son is free before leaving for ecuador 
the colombian guerrilla group believed to have kidnapped scott 
heimdal on april 28 has a long history of kidnappings and violence 
state department records show 
john reap of the state departments counterterrorism bureau said 
that while there is no proof the group known as epl was involved in 
the abduction it seems likely 
we feel its a strong possibility since kidnappings strictly 
for money with no political factors involved have been part of 
their past conduct he said 
reap said the united states is not treating heimdals kidnapping

an investigator has 
recommended modifications to a boeing aircraft after blaming a fire 
in the cargo section for the crash of a south african airways jet 
the 1987 crash near mauritius killed all 159 people aboard 
sabotage was ruled out in the report by justice cecil margo in 
newspapers tuesday but no cause could be determined for the fire in 
the boeing 747200 combi 
the plane en route from taipei taiwan to johannesburg 
plunged into the indian ocean about 1500 miles east of 
johannesburg on nov 28 1987 most of the passengers on flight 295 
were japanese taiwanese or south african 
margo called for changes in the combi configuration planes that 
have an extralarge cargo hold on the same level as the passenger 
section and cockpit 
he said smoke and gasses spread quickly through the passenger 
section and possibly the cockpit plastic and cardboard packing 
were involved in the blaze according to the investigation report 
there was a strong possibility gases and smoke overwhelmed 
the flight crew the report said 
margos report said the smokedetection firefighting equipment 
and safety procedures on the plane were inadequate 
until such problems are corrected the combi configuration 
with passengers and cargo on the same deck should be prohibited 
as creating an unacceptable risk margo said 
he said the us national transportation safety board had 
rejected his recommendation for modifications to the plane but the 
us federal aviation administration had issued new directives to 
minimize fire hazards on the combi 
south african airways has since removed the cargo section from 
the passenger level on its one remaining combi 
jack gamble spokesman for boeing commercial airplane group in 
renton wash said company officials had not seen the judges 
report 
he noted the faa had called for changes in firefighting 
procedures and some minor design modifications in dc10 and 747 
combination passengercargo aircraft 
new planes incorporate the recommendations and manufacturers 
are working to retrofit older aircraft gamble said 
we feel those faa recommendations are adequate he said 
how those changes relate to what the judge ordered we dont 
know 
margo prohibited public release of the full transcript of the 
cockpit voice recording saying it might be misunderstood or cause 
embarrassment 
the release of the report was slowed by the complicated recovery 
of wreckage from about 15000 feet underwater 
the report said investigators could find no evidence of an 
explosion in the wreckage 
it is virtually certain there was no sabotage the report 
said 
the investigation probed the cause not liability the airline 
reached an outofcourt financial settlement with relatives of the 
victims and no court cases are pending or expected

firefighters boarded a burning 
supertanker tuesday and brought under control the fierce blaze 
that has left the oilladen vessel crippled and leaking in the gulf 
of mexico officials said 
oil continued leaking from the ship the coast guard said 
a thick cloud of gray smoke surrounded the superstructure of the 
886foot mega borg replacing the balls of flame and towering 
columns of black smoke that had been billowing from the norwegian 
vessel since an engineroom explosion saturday 
coast guard capt tom greene said that ted hoskins who heads 
the salvage operation boarded the ship with a crew hoskins said 
he would characterize the fire as under control greene said 
greene said he could see no fires in the latest videos taken on 
the ship but added a fire was still burning below deck 
the fire has been pinned down in the engine room and the 
pumping room spokesman daan kaakebeen of smit internationale the 
dutch salvage company leading the firefighting effort said earlier 
in rotterdam 
the coast guard also revised its estimate of the amount of oil 
on the water to less than 2000 gallons a fraction of the 100000 
gallons officials estimated earlier the amount that had spilled 
from the tanker which was carrying 38 million gallons of light 
african crude was not determined 
much of the oil that spilled had burned off but with the fire 
now confined there is more oil in the water and the slick is 
continuing to grow greene said 
still coast guard officials said they believe a disastrous 
spill can be avoided because the light crude can be easily 
dispersed 
meanwhile mexico sent a collector vessel to help clean up the 
spill 
pemex the mexican government oil monopoly said that at the 
us governments request it sent the 146foot ecopemex which can 
suck up oil and water at the rate of 2000 barrels an hour 
separate out the oil and store it in special tanks 
crewmen boarded the tanker to determine if it had cooled enough 
to be sprayed with flamesmothering chemical foam foam spraying 
has been delayed since monday because the ship was too hot and 
crews feared another explosion even if the flames were doused 
officials speculated it could take as little as an hour to pump 
the foam into the engine room and other areas still burning 
were hoping the foam application is a success said coast 
guard petty officer howard holmes if it isnt we cant deny the 
fact that we could be in trouble but we are optimistic that the 
foam will work 
crews aimed 10 water streams from five fireboats stationed at 
the sides of the tanker and firefighters had placed another water 
hose on the deck pointing it toward the burning stern 
theyve kept applying water in great quantities and its 
continued to cool the structure greene said theyll continue 
to do that theres progress being made theyre making ground 
efforts to dissipate an oil leak apparently also were having 
some success the oil slick around the ship diminished to three 
miles by 10 miles petty officer gene maestas said most of what 
remained appeared in a light sheen with few heavy concentrations 
the ship is 57 miles southeast of galveston none of the spilled 
oil is expected to reach the coastline immediately the coast guard 
said it was moving daily about three to four miles to the northwest 
were still not completely safe from a major release until the 
fire is out and the ship is stabilized and it is brought on an even 
keel greene said 
once the fire was extinguished an 825foot britishregistered 
tanker the vic bilh was standing by to begin receiving the 
remainder of the mega borgs cargo of crude maestas said greene 
said that operation could be dangerous because the ship is listing 
slightly and crews might have to pump water into the holds to keep 
the vessel balanced 
earlier tuesday the coast guard said part of the vessel showed 
signs of buckling because of the intense 900degree blaze the 
shifting cargo and the continuous stream of water being poured on 
the hulk but later officials said crews at the scene reported no 
signs of major structural damage 
the ships left rear section however was very close to the 
water line on monday the rear had dipped below the surface 
heightening fears the vessel might sink 
id say the chance of sinking is very slight at this point 
because they have the fire well pushed back in the ship greene 
said tuesday 
the rear has dropped more than 60 feet since the tanker caught 
fire early saturday while transferring cargo to a smaller vessel 
two of the 41 crewmen died two were missing and presumed dead and 
17 were injured none seriously 
the norwegian government scheduled a hearing for wednesday 
morning in galveston to interview crew members who were aboard at 
the time of the blast and try to determine how it occurred 
little oil spilled at first but five explosions within 20 
minutes sunday sent burning crude pouring into the gulf by 
tuesday a burning trail of oil that extended for hundreds of feet 
behind the stricken tanker had diminished to a small pool 
the mega borg was carrying more than three times as much oil as 
was spilled by the exxon valdez off alaska in march 1989 in the 
nations worst oil spill but the oil spilled in alaska was heavy 
crude which doesnt dissipate nearly as rapidly as the light crude 
aboard the mega borg also much of the oil spilling off texas was 
being consumed by fire 
currents and winds were expected to push oil toward a 200mile 
stretch of coast between freeport and corpus christi an area 
considered a prime bird breeding and shellfish harvest area 
the tanker operated by mosvolds shipping of farsund norway 
was bound from palanca angola it was scheduled to travel to aruba 
after galveston 
elf a houston subsidiary of a french oil distribution company 
owned the cargo and said it would participate in the cleanup but a 
company official who spoke on condition of anonymity said tuesday 
he did not believe elf was liable for the costs

of our building which is located in the center of campus were 
rattled said sammy mcdavid spokesman for mississippi state 
university 30 miles to the west it did no damage here

us rep donald lukens conviction on a 
charge he had sex with a teenage girl was upheld tuesday by a 
state appeals court 
the 59yearold republican was convicted may 26 1989 of a 
misdemeanor charge of contributing to the unruliness of a minor he 
was accused of paying a girl to have sex with him at his columbus 
apartment in november 1988 when she was 16 
lukens was sentenced to six months in jail and fined 500 
the congressman has 30 days to appeal to the ohio supreme court 
and will remain free on bond during that time said an attorney for 
lukens thomas tyack 
lukens spoke with tyack and other attorneys by telephone from 
washington to discuss the case said lukens aide joe bukovac 
in the decision passed down there is a determination of errors 
made by the judge in the courtroom on several issues bukovac 
said at this point there are a concensus of lukens legal 
advisers leaning toward further appeal 
a threejudge panel of the 10th ohio district court of appeals 
rejected arguments by lukens attorneys that franklin county 
domestic relations judge ronald solove erred by barring testimony 
about the girls record of juvenile offenses 
lukens attorneys also contended that soloves definition of an 
unruly child differed from the definition in lukens indictment 
in addition they said the judge improperly overruled defense 
motions for a mistrial after prosecutors tried to use inadmissible 
testimony of sex between ms coffman and lukens in 1985 they 
further said the court abused its discretion in sentencing lukens 
the appeals judges rejected all the arguments 
i get frustrated in cases of this nature to be told yes there 
were errors committed but it doesnt matter tyack said 
tyack said the evidence about the girls past was necessary to 
establish she already was unruly and to challenge her credibility 
but the appeals court said tyack failed to show the records were 
relevant 
lukens lost his bid for a third consecutive term in the 8th 
congressional district gop primary in may 
a week before the election he publicly apologized for what he 
called a dumb mistake and asked voters to forgive him but he 
maintained he was innocent of the charge 
allegations that lukens had sex with the girl surfaced in early 
1989 shortly afterward a columbus television station broadcast a 
videotape of a november 1988 meeting between lukens and the girls 
mother anna coffman who confronted lukens about the relationship 
lukens did not know the meeting at a local fastfood restaurant was 
being taped by a tv crew 
on the tape lukens offered to find mrs coffman a government 
job after she accused him of messing around with her daughter 
lukens served two terms in congress from 1967 to 1970 and then 
made an unsuccessful attempt to gain the gop gubernatorial 
nomination in ohio after 15 years in the ohio senate he was 
returned to congress by voters in 1986 he was reelected in 1988

premature lowbirthweight babies given special 
education from the start scored significantly higher on iq tests at 
age 3 than their counterparts who werent helped researchers said 
tuesday 
infants born weighing between 44 pounds and 55 pounds who 
received special educational help in addition to medical care 
scored an average of 98 on iq tests taken at age 3 the researchers 
wrote 
that was 132 iq points higher than subjects who were born in 
the same weight range but who received only the medical care said 
the researchers who were led by dr ruth gross of stanford 
university 
infants who weighed about 43 pounds or less at birth and were 
given the educational help scored an average of 91 at age 3 or 66 
iq points higher than counterparts who got only medical care the 
group reported in wednesdays journal of the american medical 
association 
the predictiveness for the scores at age 3 means good things 
for the kids who were helped in the years ahead said dr donna 
bryant a study participant and research psychologist at the 
university of north carolina at chapel hill 
the fact that the differences were so great means that fewer 
of these kids will be held back in school she said 
the fouryear study involved 985 babies born in 1985 in eight 
states arkansas new york massachusetts florida texas 
washington connecticut and pennsylvania onethird received the 
educational help twothirds did not 
almost 7 percent of babies born annually in the united states 
or 250000 are of lowbirth weight 55 pounds or less said gross 
thanks to advances in technology almost all babies born 
weighing more than 45 pounds survive and those weighing about 2 
pounds have a 20 percent chance of survival gross said 
but she added that all lowbirthweight babies risk 
developmental problems 
of the children studied those not helped educationally were 27 
times more likely to have iqs in the mental retardation range 
below 70 the study found an average iq for all people is 100 
in the study the babies who were helped had researchers visit 
their families homes weekly during the childs first year to 
advise the parents and make sure the babies had educational toys 
at 1 year old the child started going to a child development 
center five days a week while researchers continued visiting the 
home every two weeks 
the researchers also held group meetings for parents every two 
weeks to give advice about child rearing and health and safety 
berry brazelton a pediatrics professor at harvard universitys 
medical school said the study results certainly showed the 
importance of early intervention the critical part of this 
study is the first year 
but arnold sameroff a psychologist who teaches at brown 
university and practices at bradley hospital in providence ri 
said other researchers will find it hard to tell what in the 
multifaceted treatment made the difference 
universities involved in the 33 million study were the 
university of arkansas little rock albert einstein college of 
medicine new york harvard medical school boston university of 
miami in florida university of pennsylvania philadelphia 
university of texas dallas university of washington seattle and

ruocheng has been dismissed as vice minister of culture the 
official xinhua news agency said tuesday 
ying along with the culture minister shortstory writer wang 
meng was a proponent of greater artistic freedom wang was fired 
as minister in september 
no explaination was given for yings dismissal 
official reports initially said wang wanted more time to write

both moves appeared to be part of the communist leaderships 
effort to restore tight controls over artists since suppressing 
last years mass prodemocracy demonstrations 
ying played no public role in the studentled democracy movement 
and is not known to have supported it but the crushing of the 
movement created a political backlash in which conservatives gained 
the upper hand and have tried to rein in liberalism especially in 
the arts 
as a director ying introduced several western plays to chinese 
audiences including shakespeares measure for measure and 
the tempest and arthur millers death of a salesman in 
which ying played willy loman 
in bernardo bertoluccis movie the last emperor filmed in 
china ying played the jailer who helps remold deposed emperor pu 
yi into a socialist citizen he also played mongol emperor kublai 
khan in the 1982 television miniseries marco polo produced by 
italy the united states japan and china

approved since may 18 by the state council chinas cabinet xinhua 
said it was the first time any of the changes have been disclosed 
also dismissed was a second vice minister of culture wang jifu 
a career party official xinhua said ying and wang were replaced by 
xu wenbo and chen changben

southern baptists elected a fundamentalist 
minister president tuesday solidifying conservative control of the 
nations largest protestant denomination 
the rev morris chapman of wichita falls texas defeated the 
candidate backed by moderates the rev daniel vestal of the 
atlanta suburb of dunwoody the 21471to15753 vote gave chapman 
a 58 percent majority 
the convention moved toward curtailing funding for the 
washingtonbased baptist joint committee on public affairs which 
lobbies for religious freedom on behalf of nine baptist bodies 
fundamentalists have denounced the lobby for opposing organized 
prayer in public schools and for not opposing abortion 
the election outcome extended fundamentalist control for the 
12th straight year some moderates predicted they would give up 
trying to retake control of the 149 millionmember denomination 
some also said its national operations with a budget of more than 
440 million a year would lose much support from moderates 
chapman said at a postelection news conference that he would 
seek peace and harmony in the denomination but what we 
believe about the bible is nonnegotiable he said he has never 
advocated any wholesale housecleaning of those not accepting 
belief in an infallible bible 
nearly all southern baptists are theological conservatives 
devoted to the bibles authority but fundamentalists stress its 
inerrancy that it is without error in any way historically 
scientifically or religiously 
they also have imposed detailed questioning in denominational 
agencies and institutions to assure adherence of personnel to the 
expanded requirements 
the southern baptist presidency is one of the most powerful 
offices in us christianity with appointive powers controlling 
selection of governing trustees of a farflung network of agencies 
and institutions 
chapman said he would advocate attrition to get rid of staff 
members executives or seminary professors who could not subscribe 
to an inerrant bible he said he felt that in time they would 
find a home more in line with their convictions 
members of first baptist church in wichita falls where chapman 
has been pastor since 1979 said they think chapman is the kind of 
person who can mend the denominations rift 
i see him as someone that can play the role of a peacemaker 
so im excited about it said tom bacus 44 a deacon of the 
4000member church 
although some moderates including vestal are fundamentalist or 
literalist about the bible they leave room for other 
understandings under the baptist view of soul competence of the 
individual 
the rev jerry vines of jacksonville fla who is completing 
his term as president told the convention that some want to leave 
room for all in the denomination but thats too much room 
he said denominations that havent insisted on an infallible 
inerrant bible were bound for the garbage dump 
the convention approved a change recommended by the executive 
committee to turn over religious liberty concerns to the 
denominations christian life commission this was expected to lead 
wednesday to a vote to cut out 87 percent of southern baptist 
support or 365328 from the baptist joint committee on public 
affairs 
numerous speakers protested turning over lobbying to a 
commission concerned with morality and abandoning the joint 
committee 
henry green of cocoa fla pleaded that we maintain 
fellowship with other baptists saying it is unbilibal to 
railroad through this plan to destroy cooperation 
the campaigns for the presidency were intensified this time by 
added fundamentalist attacks on seminaries including the 
administration and some professors at the 131yearold flagship 
southern baptist theological seminary in louisville ky 
its president the rev roy honeycutt and the faculty have 
struck back calling accusations of doctrinal infidelity false 
distortions that sow seeds of hate 
chapman 49 a mississippi native got his theological education 
at southwester baptist theological seminary in fort worth texas 
he was pastor of churches in albuquerque nm and in waco and 
rogers texas before assuming his present pastorate at first 
baptist church in wichita falls texas 
vestal 46 the son of an evangelist also got his ministerial 
education at the fort worth seminary he previously led churches in 
arlington fort worth and midland texas before becoming pastor of 
dunwoody baptist church in suburban atlanta

a federal judge ordered an oil tanker 
impounded tuesday so that new jersey new york and new york city 
can guarantee that the vessels owner pay for damages resulting from 
last weeks 260000gallon oil spill 
this order gives us the power to prevent them from moving the 
ship until were satisfied said gordon johnson an assistant 
attorney general for the state of new york 
johnson said govs jim florio of new jersey and mario cuomo of 
new york decided to seek the impoundment of the vessel because 
officials received word that the ship bt nautilus could be ready to 
move as early as wednesday from bayonne where it was docking 
thursday when it ran aground 
charles anderson a new york city attorney representing the 
811foot ships owners nautilus motor tanker co of london 
characterized us district judge nicholas politans order as 
routine in maritime cases 
anderson said the ship was under repair and no decisions have 
been made on moving it he said the companys underwriters are 
working on posting a bond to guarantee payment of cleanup costs 
workers collected about 100 gallons of oil waste that washed up 
along a fivemile stretch of sandy hook beach tuesday including 
three miles of beaches where swimming is normally permitted 
according to the national parks service the beach was clean by 5 
pm said parks service spokesman manny strumpf 
the coast guard has not determined the cause of the grounding 
navigational charts of the area where the bt nautilus ran 
aground are accurate and the accident would not have occurred if 
the ship had been following the proper route said capt robert 
north coordinator of the cleanup 
a grand jury is to meet this week to consider charges that the 
tankers first mate gregory frederick geoffrey 52 of new marske 
england was operating a vessel while intoxicated said christopher 
florentz a spokesman for the new jersey attorney generals office 
the coast guard said tests of the captain albert ainscough and 
the pilot jim naughton showed no traces of drug or alcohol use 
the bt nautilus ran aground while being docked ripping a 
30footlong gash in its hull and pouring 260000 gallons of no 6 
industrial heating oil into the kill van kull a busy waterway 
separating bayonne from the new york city borough of staten island 
attorneys for new york and new jersey argued that the captain 
and crew were incompetent inattentive reckless and otherwise 
grossly negligent in their duties which resulted in the general 
unseaworthiness of the bt nautilus that condition caused the 
illegal discharge of oil according to papers filed in federal 
court 
anderson said the allegations were totally unfounded and 
noted that the cause of the investigation remained under 
investigation 
the spill was the fourth major one in the waterway and nearby 
arthur kill this year

most north american newsprint producers 
increased prices about 5 percent in june the first broad hike in 
more than two years but buyers say theyll resist paying it 
because of plentiful supplies 
industry analysts and purchasers say the 35 increase which 
raised the benchmark eastern us list price of standard newsprint 
to 685 a metric ton hinges mainly on whether labor negotiations 
are settled at mills in eastern canada the worlds largest single 
source of newsprint 
the labor dispute is probably the only thing thats keeping 
the price increase in place now said dan dowis director of 
newsprint for knightridder inc one of the nations largest 
newspaper groups 
if the negotiations are settled without a strike youll see a 
lot of the increase going back to purchasers in the form of 
discounts or even rollbacks on whats being paid now dowis said 
our policy is that we wont pay the increased price 
the price hike which went into effect june 1 was first 
announced in february by abitibiprice inc of toronto the worlds 
secondlargest newsprint maker behind fletcher challenge of new 
zealand 
it is the first since an industrywide increase of 66 percent on 
jan 1 1988 and producers say the hike is overdue because of 
declining profits that have left them struggling at the margin 
threatening mill shutdowns 
sellers have been getting killed all the canadians who are 
twothirds of the north american market are making no money 
because theyre selling at 525 a ton and thats their cost to 
produce said mark kurland an analyst with mabon nugent in new 
york 
newsprint is now sold at about a 19 percent discount from the 
list price the increase raises actual transaction prices to about 
555560 a metric ton from about 525 
newspaper companies have been stockpiling inventories of about 
50 days in anticipation of a possible strike at canadian mills 
which have already begun to cut production 
the industry is closely watching talks that began may 31 between 
montrealbased stone consolidated inc and the canadian 
paperworkers union which is seeking wage increases of 8 percent a 
year in each of two years 
a strike at stone which would likely spread to the entire 
industry would sharply curtail supplies it also could force the 
shutdown of some canadian mills which already face the prospect of 
a costly retooling from virgin pulp to recycled production 
the increase will go through for now if stone settles then 
newsprint purchasers will have the upper hand and it will probably 
argue against the increase holding said kurland

the citys two newspapers decided june 8 
to dissolve their joint operating agreement ending a lawsuit filed 
by the morning knoxville newssentinel against the afternoon 
knoxville journal 
under the joa the newssentinel provided sales production and 
distribution for the journal editorial departments of the two 
newspapers are separate 
the lawsuit claimed that the journals owner persis corp 
violated terms of the agreement when it purchased the daily times 
in nearby maryville last year journal editor and publisher gerald 
garcia was made president and publisher of the daily times 
the newssentinel which recently began a zoned edition in 
maryville considered the daily times a direct competitor 
the lawsuit contended that with garcia in the dual roles the 
daily times would have access to the newssentinels confidential 
business information and trade secrets 
the arrangement to end the joa calls for the newssentinel to 
pay persis 40 million in two 20 million installments the money 
will be in lieu of payments the journal would have received from 
dec 31 1991 through the scheduled end of the agreement on dec 
31 2005 
the plan calls for the joa to end in december 1991 until then 
the newssentinel will continue to act as agent on some business 
matters for the journal 
the newssentinel owned by the ew scripps co has a daily 
circulation of 101000 and a sunday circulation of 169000 the 
journal publishes monday through saturday with a circulation of 
40000

a government study conducted for newsday and its 
union shows there is significant association between computer 
keyboard work and repetitive strain injury one of the researchers 
said june 7 
the study the first comprehensive survey of repetitive strain 
injury in the us newspaper industry also concluded that computer 
terminal use among workers at newsday and new york newsday 
presented a hazard to workers health it did not quantify or 
elaborate on the risks 
the study by the national institute for occupational safety and 
health and the university of michigan found no single cause for the 
injuries cincinnatibased niosh researcher susan burt said in a 
telephone interview 
she said several factors contribute to the risk of getting 
repetitive strain injury or rsi including 
repetitive motions like those made while typing on a computer 
keyboard 
work positions like extending the wrists up in an awkward 
position in order to type 
static position caused by holding arms up in order to type 
the study also found that how long a person worked at a keyboard 
without a break and how fast they typed contributed to problems 
associated with rsi we do not recommend working at a keyboard 
for extended periods without taking a break she said no 
specific time limit was given 
the study group included 834 workers at newsday and new york 
newsday they included reporters editors clerical and secretarial 
employees who worked in the editorial financial advertising and 
circulation departments 
burt said the employees were asked if they had experienced any 
pain aching numbness tingling or burning in their handwrist 
elbow shoulder and neck area within a 12month period 
by definition she said the pain had to last at least a week or 
occur at least once a month they also had to have no previous 
history of acute injury to the area and the pain had to have 
started on their current job 
survey results showed that 331 of the 834 employees or 40 
percent reported one or more symptoms in at least one of the four 
regions some time within the past year 
burt cautioned that the results were based on selfreporting and 
said niosh estimated they were twice as high than if we had done 
physical examinations as well as questionnaires 
of all the employees questioned she said reporters appeared 
to be at higher risk than the other workers 
some believed that the type of keyboard used may contribute to 
rsi but burt said we found no significant difference 
researchers did say however that work stations crowded with 
computers desks chairs and other equipment could contribute to 
the problem 
repetitive strain injury is listed as the leading cause of 
occupational illness by the us bureau of labor statistics the 
bureau said 115400 cases of rsi were reported nationwide in 1988 
representing 48 percent of all workplace illnesses 
the malady has been reported in a wide range of workers 
including office employees assemblyline jobs and within the 
meatpacking industry 
the study was requested by newsday and the graphics 
communication international union local 406 which represents 
nearly half of the newspapers 3100 fulltime employees 
researchers recommended that newsday establish a 
labormanagement committee to handle rsi problems and train 
employees on how to use adjustable equipment and change their work 
habits 
assistant managing editor robert keane said the newspaper has 
already initiated those recommendations 
john mcdonald vice president of the unions editorial unit 
said further studies may be done to show how individual work habits 
and equipment contributes to rsi 
burt said the agency is beginning work on two more studies on 
rsi at the los angeles times and us west a large 
telecommunications company

the newspaper preservation act is fattening 
publishers wallets but eroding press freedom and the quality of 
the nations journalism a republican congressman says 
it seems ironic that some of the very voices which call for 
free market forces to work in other industries seek government 
protection for creating monopolies in their own said rep carl 
pursell of michigan 
pursell introduced a bill june 6 to repeal the 1970 law which 
allows newspapers in the same city to operate as a single business 
entity while maintaining separate news staffs 
the bill would not affect the partial mergers already in place 
but it would prohibit similar arrangements known as joint 
operating agreements or joas in the future 
leaders of citizens for an independent press a national 
coalition of small newspaper publishers business and civic 
leaders endorsed pursells bill they accused the large newspapers 
that have entered into joas of sacrificing principle for profit 
these crybaby billionaires have for many years enjoyed one of 
the biggest and most enduring specialinterest giveaways in 
american history said bruce b brugmann editor and publisher of 
the san francisco bay guardian a weekly newspaper 
newspapers in 19 cities were operating under joas last year 
attorney general dick thornburgh approved two others in las vegas 
and york pa this year 
some of the countrys oldest and best newspapers would be out of 
business without joas said joseph ungaro president and chief 
executive officer of the detroit newspaper agency his company 
administers a joa between the detroit free press and the detroit 
news 
the free press daily circulation was 629275 in march 1989 and 
rose to 639767 by march 1990 ungaro said 
the news circulation fell from 693943 in march 1989 to 526147 
in march 1990 largely because of a decision to scale back 
circulation outside the detroit area and to make the news an 
afternoon paper instead of retaining most of the previous morning 
editions ungaro said 
id have to say that the readers are voting with their 
pocketbooks every day by buying the product he said 
ungaro noted that knightridder which owns the free press had 
indicated it would close the moneylosing newspaper if the joa were 
denied 
is one paper with a monopoly better than two voices in the 
community i dont think so ungaro said

the second round of layoffs at the daily news in 
two weeks was unrelated to contract negotiations an executive for 
the newspaper says 
john t sloan the news vice president of human resources said 
june 4 the laying off of 13 fulltime and eight parttime 
photoengravers stemmed from the soft newspaper economy and 
because we are overmanned in the photoengraver department 
union leader stanley aslanian called it a further tightening 
of the screws though he agreed the cuts were permissible under 
provisions of the contract 
on may 29 the newspaper announced the layoff of 17 machinists 
because of reduced advertising revenue 
intense negotiations have been taking place over daily news 
labor contracts that expired march 30 
both sides acknowledge that the survival of the news is at 
stake although the paper says it must eliminate workers and 
increase productivity to survive and the unions say the paper is 
trying to decimate them en route to shutting down the paper or 
selling it

a federal district judge is considering 
whether to dismiss a 38 million libel suit filed against two 
journalists by irancontra figure richard v secord 
lawyer dean ringel told judge george h revercombe on june 5 
that secords suit against leslie and andrew cockburn and the 
atlantic monthly press should be dismissed because no actual malice 
has been proved 
but w michael kramer attorney for the former air force major 
general contended the authors in a 1988 book falsely linked 
secord to narcotics trafficking said to have been carried out as 
part of the effort to finance the contra rebels 
kramer asked the judge for additional time to take depositions 
and search for further evidence in the case 
revercombe took both motions under advisement 
kramer contended that the clear intent of the book out of 
control the story of the reagan administrations secret war in 
nicaragua was to exploit the irancontra affair by putting the 
administration and its key players in the worst possible light 
but ringel appealing for dismissal said mr secord seems to 
assume that since the book takes a political position opposite to 
that of the previous administration that is evidence of malice 
secords libel suit was filed in march 1988 the same day he was 
indicted for his irancontra role 
he was sentenced to two years probation on one of 12 original 
counts after a plea bargain but he is appealing alleging that 
independent counsel lawrence walsh lacked jurisdiction to prosecute 
for an offense arising out of secords congressional irancontra 
testimony

newspapers in portland and detroit have 
gotten into the rivalry over the nba finals between the trail 
blazers and the pistons 
just what sort of place is this portland the detroit news 
asked on its editorial page june 5 
well for starters the news says there is the cultural tone of 
the oregon city 
portlands image is pretty well captured by its mayor bud 
clark a tavern owner who posed as a flasher in a promotion for the 
local arts community a few years back the poster showed mr clark 
back to the camera raincoat wide open flashing a sculpture above 
the slogan expose yourself to art 
portland is also a place where the city council renamed the 
boulevard where all the hookers hang out after martin luther king 
the oregonian returned fire in an editorial two days later 
detroit a french word meaning lets move to houston was 
founded by antoine de la mothe cadillac who settled there when the 
transmission in his canoe gave out the newspaper said 
if the detroit news thinks portland is boring and snooty the 
oregonian thinks detroit may be too exciting for its own good 
the last time the detroit tigers won a world series in 1984 
detroits major league fans celebrated by setting the city on 
fire the oregonian said the national guard complained but 
city planners thought it was a good idea

the public and press have the right to a list of 
jurors names even if those jurors fearing the revenge of a 
defendant they sent to jail ask that their identities remain 
secret the boston globe argued june 6 before the 1st circuit us 
court of appeals 
a former us solicitor general countered that while a judge 
cannot halt the obnoxious and harmful process by which jurors 
become media personalities he does not have to make the reporters 
job any easier 
the globe challenged a ruling last april by us district court 
judge edward f harrington who withheld the names of jurors in a 
money laundering case 
in briefs filed in support of the case the newspaper held that 
the jurors are acting in a public role when they render a verdict 
and that the public has a historical right to know who they are 
assistant us attorney f dennis saylor iv also argued for the 
names to be released in an appearance against the presiding judge 
that senior circuit judge frank coffin termed highly unusual 
saylor told the appeals court the us government did not consider 
the security of the jurors in the case threatened 
former us solicitor general charles fried arguing on 
harringtons behalf said the judge was under no obligation to 
provide the list reporters were free to corner jurors on their way 
out of the courtroom if they could he said 
but a judge fried argued has the right to say im not 
going to make the reporters job easier i cannot stop it i 
cannot shut it down but i will not facilitate it that is the 
heart of this case 
the money laundering case involved alleged members of organized 
crime and one of the defendants was still at large at the time of 
the trial jurors in the case had asked that their names not be 
disclosed because they feared retribution by the defendants

most americans would welcome cable television 
competition according to a gallup poll released june 4 by one of 
the telephone companies eager to get into the business 
a majority of those surveyed also said they would like to have 
twoway video services such as movies on demand library services 
and officeinthehome services that could be provided through a 
network of highcapacity fiberoptic telephone lines 
this is a clear indication that the public would favor 
competition and innovation said kent b foster president of gte 
telephone operations which commissioned the study 
the poll results were released as congressional committees 
beset by constituent complaints of high prices and poor service 
consider legislation to reregulate the cable industry 
a proposal by sen conrad burns rmont would lift some 
provisions of the 1984 cable act that prohibit companies such as 
gte from providing video programming within their telephone service 
areas 
other federal laws prohibit the seven regional bell companies 
from selling cable tv programming

a senate committee gave nearunanimous 
approval june 7 to a bill that would allow local governments to 
control some cable television prices 
the 181 vote by the senate commerce science and transportation 
committee marked the first time lawmakers have moved to restore 
some of the regulation of the cable industry that congress lifted 
in the 1984 cable act 
the 1984 law ended local rate regulation effective in 1987 and 
since then members of congress have been deluged with complaints of 
soaring prices and poor service 
more than 20 reregulation bills were introduced in congress in 
the past two years and the senate communications subcommittee held 
nine hearings before the compromise bill emerged 
the bill among other things would 
allow local governments to regulate prices for a basic tier 
of channels including local overtheair broadcast channels 
adsupported pay cable channels such as espn cnn and mtv would not 
be subject to local rate regulation however if local authorities 
or a subscriber complains about rate increases for such 
adsupported cable channels the fcc could establish reasonable 
rates if it finds them to be excessive 
require cable operators not to discriminate against cable 
programmers like movie channels with which they have no 
affiliation some cable companies are owned by giant conglomerates 
that also own movie channels 
require that all cable programmers make their programming 
available to home dish owners

more lobbyists than ever are swarming through state 
legislatures spending more money than ever before to influence 
lawmakers 
but a 50state look at lobbyists by the associated press found 
few states effectively monitor their activities rules regulating 
lobbyists are riddled with loopholes and the legislators who make 
those rules receive lobbyists campaign contributions meals and 
gifts 
in most states it is virtually impossible to know how much 
lobbyists are spending and which legislators they spend it on 
money buys access and access buys a higher degreee of 
success said chuck sauvage of the washington state branch of 
common cause which itself lobbies for more accountability by those 
who make and influence legislation 
were in danger of seeing government of the special interests 
by the special interests and for the special interests 
the growth in the number of lobbyists comes at a time when the 
responsibility for funding social welfare programs is shifting from 
congress to the states and legislatures are tackling such complex 
issues as the environment abortion gun control smoking 
restrictions and car insurance 
pick any aspect of life and there is apt to be a lobbyist for or 
against it 
lobbyists represent baby doctors and undertakers insurers and 
the lawyers who sue for claims environmentalists and companies who 
bury toxic waste gun control groups and the national rifle 
association health care providers and tobacco and liquor 
interests churches and casinos corporations and unions farmers 
and bankers the media and local governments 
lobbyists persuade lawmakers to pass kill or amend laws to 
benefit the special interest that hired them they have a 
constitutional right to air their side and they are an important 
source of analysis and expertise for understaffed legislatures that 
were created as citizen assemblies 
lobbyists get little mention in civics lessons yet leaving out 
lobbyists from the way a bill becomes a law is like having a road 
map with only interstate highways they are the access ramps back 
roads shortcuts cutoffs and detours 
lobbyists outnumber lawmakers nearly 6to1 the ap survey found 
more than 42500 registered lobbyists at state capitols an 
increase of 20 percent from the council of state governments 
registry four years ago when ronald reagan was in office 
that new federalism mr reagan gave us didnt necessarily mean 
less government it sort of meant a change of address said 
roland luedtke a former lawmaker and lieutenant governor in 
nebraska 
lawmakers insist they do not sell votes while lobbyists say they 
do not buy them indeed examples of outright bribery are rare but 
critics say the system is so ambiguous that wrongdoing becomes a 
matter of perception 
its ripe for abuse theres the potential for corruption and 
undue influence said kirby hendee a retired lobbyist and former 
state senator in wisconsin people have got to get mad 
somebodys stealing the heart of government and they dont seem 
excited about it 
some point to campaign contributions as the most corrosive 
influence 
its a form of bribery its not cash under the table but 
its the equivalent of cash said florida sen tom brown the 
public perception is that if you take things youre obligated to 
them its patently absurd to think otherwise 
what do the persuaders get for their money 
access its access the kind of access the typical voter 
doesnt have said pennsylvania rep allen kukovich if they 
get on the phone or make an appointment snap they want to get in 
there they want your ear this is america money talks money buys 
access 
i cant honestly say anyones for sale i think there are some 
members who are for lease kukovich said i dont think 
lobbyists are bad the problem is i think they have too much 
influence 
how much lobbyists spend and how they spend it causes the most 
alarm among those who feel special interests dominate legislatures 
for example the day after lobbyists for alamo rent a car 
treated 27 members of floridas house rules committee to a dinner 
of steak red snapper and conch chowder last year the panel voted 
alamos way and killed a proposal to limit how much rental car 
companies charge for collision damage waivers 
this year floridabased alamo won a victory in the house 
insurance committee it rejected a bill that would have forced car 
companies to charge less for refueling cars 
before the vote at least 12 of the 17 lawmakers on the panel 
got 9000 in campaign contributions all legal from rental car 
interests chairman peter deutsch got 1000 each from alamo and 
hertz which were on opposing sides 
alamo also provided free use of a buick for four days to rep 
steve geller chairman of the house insurance subcommittee who 
voted alamos way geller said accepting the car was a 
misunderstanding and he paid for it after his using it became 
public 
car companies and lawmakers said no votes were bought or sold 
but kevin bloom of the florida consumer action network said the two 
actions were revealing 
its one example of special interests like alamo using 
affluence to influence the outcome of legislative matters bloom 
said theres no way you can take gifts or favors or anything of 
value and not be influenced 
the ap examination of lobbyists found a hodgepodge of laws 
regulating them and their spending activities campaign 
contributions and gifts that are perfectly legal in some states 
would bring criminal censure in others most of the laws were 
written by lawmakers only a handful of states have regulations 
enacted by voters 
four states dont require lobbyists to report what they spend 
trying to influence legislators lobbyists in the other states 
rarely have to identify the lawmakers they wine and dine or give 
gifts to 
state governments spend little to monitor lobbying ranging from 
about 750000 in california to an estimated 400 in oklahoma 
twentythree states devote only one or a parttime staffer to 
oversight 
a century ago massachusetts made the first attempt at making 
special interests accountable by requiring a detailed statement of 
all expenses and registration of those working for special 
interests 
only one state wisconsin forbids lawmakers from accepting a 
gift trip meal or anything of value even a cup of coffee 
from a lobbyist but even it allows special interests to make 
campaign contributions 
all states require lobbyists to register but four georgia 
louisiana utah and wyoming dont require any reports on what 
they spend the rules in most of the rest are written so lobbyists 
generally can report only their overall spending and dont have to 
identify individual legislators on whom money is spent 
of the 46 states that require some degree of reporting of 
lobbyists spending 29 do not audit the reports for accuracy and 
merely try to make sure the reports are filed on time twentyeight 
of the 46 conducted no investigations of the previous reporting 
period 
in a typical comment mcdonald t coker assistant director of 
delawares legislative council said of his states law there is 
no accounting system the law is so loose you couldnt catch 
anyone if you wanted to

almost as revealing as what some lobbyists report is what they 
dont 
last year california had an estimated 90 million reported 
spent by lobbyists 
yet in a loopholeridden state like pennsylvania lobbyists as a 
group reported spending 362000 thats a fraction of what was 
reported in smaller states like connecticut montana mississippi 
hawaii nebraska new hampshire south carolina kentucky and 
kansas the top lobbyist in at least five states reported spending 
more than was reported by pennsylvanias 799 lobbyists combined 
many former elected officials have found second careers as 
lobbyists among exgovernors representing special interest groups 
are marvin mandel of maryland and anthony earl and martin schreiber 
of wisconsin 
some of the best paid lobbyists make sixfigure incomes that are 
several times greater than even the highest paid legislators in 
maryland for instance lobbyist bruce bereano got more than 1 
million in fees from 53 clients in 1989 
the persuaders not surprisingly arent in favor of more 
reporting 
requiring a lobbyist to report doesnt make them honest or 
dishonest no lobbyist is going to report doing something 
illegal said hobson waits a lobbyist for the electric power 
associations of mississippi inc 
watchdogs agree but they say the point is the public interest 
would be best served if special interests reported in detail what 
they do to influence legislators 
weve cut the average citizen out of the process said barry 
kauffman of pennsylvania common cause 
its the contemporary golden rule those with the gold make 
the rules kauffman said people are turned off theyve passed 
apathy and gone to alienation its not their system anymore

lobbyists largess to legislators has often upset citizens but 
cases rarely have wound up in court in recent years 
california sen joseph montoya was convicted in february of 
selling votes to special interests who were actually undercover 
federal agents he was found guilty of racketeering money 
laundering and five counts of extortion for demanding campaign 
contributions and speaking fees in exchange for votes 
last year federal prosecutors in west virginia won convictions 
or guilty pleas from two former senate presidents a senate 
majority leader a member of the house of delegates two lobbyists 
and a senate aide in votebuying cases 
in wisconsin two dozen legislators and lobbyists violated the 
states ethics law last year by accepting or offering meals hotel 
rooms tickets to sporting events or travel expenses wisconsin is 
the only state that bars legislators from accepting or lobbyists 
from giving them anything of value even a soft drink 
eighteen of the cases involved inadvertent or minor infractions 
but sen william shoemaker pleaded guilty after he was charged with 
accepting illegal loans from a lobbyist and stealing money from his 
campaign committee shoemaker resigned his seat and served 60 days

chicken magnate lonnie bo pilgrim came 
to the capitol last july to argue for changes he wanted made in the 
workmens compensation program 
while he was at it he handed out 10000 checks to eight of the 
31 texas senators 
pilgrim said it was just a way to get access to the senators so 
theyd listen to his case all it does is they will answer a 
telephone call or give you an appointment to listen to hear 
issues he said 
one senator returned his check before reporters learned of them 
and the others followed suit after news reports triggered a public 
outcry 
travis county district attorney ronnie earle called the handouts 
outrageous but apparently legal it wasnt a bribe under texas 
law if reported as a campaign contribution 
this is not a simple area of the law its not like somebody 
going to a 7eleven and saying stick em up its much more 
complicated earle said

americans believe state lawmakers regularly swap 
their votes for payoffs and they favor strict regulation of 
political lobbying to curtail such influence peddling a national 
poll has found 
by overwhelming majorities respondents to the media 
generalassociated press poll said state legislators are overly 
influenced by gifts or campaign contributions from lobbyists and 
they favored banning such favors 
half the respondents furthermore said lawmakers are more 
interested in raising money for their reelection than in passing 
good laws nine in 10 favored limiting the amount candidates can 
spend to run for state office 
nearly twothirds of the 1071 adults polled expressed negative 
views of the ethical behavior of state lawmakers an even stronger 
majority 74 percent rated lobbyists ethical performance as 
only fair or poor 
lobbyists pervade the lawmaking process representing 
businesses unions and other organizations that have an interest in 
proposed laws they seek through information and persuasion to 
draw legislators to their view 
lobbyists work at all levels of government although much 
attention is focused on their efforts in washington the survey 
sought to gauge public awareness of lobbying at the state level 
it found that statehouse lobbying is widely recognized and 
largely criticized nearly half the respondents said lobbyists have 
a great amount of influence in shaping state laws yet only a 
quarter believed the information supplied by lobbyists to lawmakers 
is reliable 
fully half expressed an unfavorable opinion of lobbyists and 
said their influence in shaping laws is too great the poll found 
that criticism of lobbyists rose among the most educated 
respondents 
support for new lobbying regulations was overwhelming eight in 
10 said they would back a disclosure law requiring lobbyists to 
publicly report all contacts they have with state lawmakers 
even more nearly nine in 10 said it should be illegal for 
lobbyists to give gifts to state lawmakers threequarters said 
lobbyists should be banned from making political campaign 
contributions and twothirds said lobbyists should be barred from 
paying for legislators meals 
few such restrictions are currently in place 
no state requires lobbyists to report all their contacts with 
state legislators nor does any state ban lobbyists from making 
campaign contributions that would be an infrigement of their 
constitutional right to participate in the political process only 
one state wisconsin prohibits legislators from accepting gifts 
or meals from legislators 
the support for restrictions appeared to stem from concern over 
the effect of favors from lobbyists eightythree percent said 
lawmakers are overly influenced by campaign contributions from 
lobbyists and 75 percent said gifts from lobbyists create undue 
influence 
in an even more damning assessment respondents saw some forms 
of influence peddling as commonplace eight in 10 said lawmakers 
sometimes vote the way lobbyists want them to in exchange for gifts 
from the lobbyists and nearly nine in 10 said lawmakers sometimes 
vote the way some organization wants them to in order to get 
campaign contributions from that organization 
about six in 10 said they believe such incidents happen either 
most of the time or a good part of the time 
the concern over lobbying and its effect on lawmaking spanned 
the political spectrum with similar shares of respondents in 
accord regardless of ideology or party affiliation 
many lawmakers complain that the cost of political campaigns 
makes them devote considerable time to fundraising and the poll 
found a broad public perception that fundraising is paramount to 
politicians 
it asked which of these do you think is more important to 
most state lawmakers passing good laws or raising money for 
their next reelection campaign fiftyone percent said 
fundraising came first and an additional 7 percent were unsure 
eightynine percent favored limits on the amount of money 
candidates can spend to run for state office but just six in 10 of 
that group backed some form of public funding for political 
campaigns even though courts have ruled that spending cannot be 
limited unless public financing is provided 
the poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage 
points it was conducted sept 1424 when most state legislatures 
were out of session that time was selected to avoid having 
opinions on current legislative action influence more general views 
on legislators and lobbyists

business people know the value of entertaining their clients 
over a few drinks and a sumptuous meal in a relaxed setting its a 
cost of forging working relationships 
and no one does it better than the special interests influencing 
state legislators in the 50 state capitols wining and dining goes 
with lobbying as easily as gin mixes with vermouth 
the entertainment with legislators is the most important part 
of our business it is the wrench to the plumber said new mexico 
lobbyist edwin t mahr he estimated 80 percent of the 1 million 
his firm spent in 198789 went for such entertainment 
lobbyists and lawmakers insist votes arent exchanged for meals 
but critics say special interests get special attention at the 
expense of the public interest 
in a 50state look at lobbying the associated press found a 
crazyquilt of laws that lacks significant oversight and fails to 
give an accurate national picture of how much special interests 
spend on entertaining and which lawmakers they spend it on 
getting to know the people who pass change or kill legislation 
is vital for lobbyists hoping to persuade them to take the side of 
their special interest 
there could be nothing worse for a lobbyist than not to be 
recognized said melvin cooper executive director of the alabama 
ethics commission 
theyre selling ideas just like somebody else is selling a 
car said jan konesey of delaware common cause a group that 
itself lobbies for laws to make government more open to public 
view when lobbyists go out to dinner with legislators or play 
golf with them or take them to a football game youre just 
building relationships that make you a better salesman 
whether those contacts go too far is another matter and voters 
have little to go on other than the word of legislators and 
lobbyists that there isnt undue influence 
four states require no reporting by lobbyists of their spending 
at all and only 31 of the remaining 46 require lobbyists to break 
down spending into categories such as entertainment 
however the 31 states have thresholds whereby a lawmaker being 
entertained doesnt have to be identified unless the amount spent 
is above a set amount in arizona for example lobbyists dont 
have to list separate expenses if they spend less then 25 for each 
issue they discuss with a legislator so a lobbyist could buy a 
lawmaker a 74 meal and not have to disclose it if they talked 
about three issues 
the people who get hurt are those who are not at the table 
and thats usually the taxpayer there is this insiders game that 
is almost exclusionary of the public said chuck sauvage of 
common cause in washington state which itself lobbies for more 
accountability by those who make and influence laws 
some states are considering tighter rules 
on june 6 california voters overwhelmingly passed an 
ethicsingovernment measure among other things it prohibits 
lawmakers from accepting speaking fees and requires the legislature 
to bar or strictly limit gifts to elected officials 
and the public in general has strong opinions about 
accountability 
in a media generalassociated press poll 75 percent of 1071 
adults across the nation said gifts from lobbyists create undue 
influence eight in 10 said lawmakers sometimes vote the way 
lobbyists want them to in exchange for gifts 
eight in 10 said they would back a disclosure law requiring 
lobbyists to publicly report all contacts they have with state 
lawmakers 
contacts pay off nebraska sen ernie chambers contends 
there have always been those senators who have gone to the 
trough with a glad heart the free meals the free booze and the 
free whatever else they could get chambers said and then they 
say that this is just business that it doesnt buy their vote or 
influence them unduly bull 
florida rep ron glickman said lobbyists have natural 
advantages because they have things members want financial 
contributions and gifts it may not be direct trade but theres a 
feeling of good will when an issue comes up for a vote theyll 
say we helped you its time for you to help 
lobbyists do expect something in return for their hospitality 
even if its not an outright exchange said kirby hendee a retired 
lobbyist and former state senator in wisconsin 
if you buy a guy enough meals and buy him enough drinks hes 
going to vote your way over time you cant repeal human nature 
hendee said 
the special interests decry the notion that the way to a 
lawmakers vote is through his stomach 
if you can buy him for a steak and a martini he wasnt worth 
the time of having dinner with said victor condello a partner 
in a new york lobbying firm that makes more than 1 million 
annually 
but lobbyists who dont have deep pockets appreciate the value 
of wining and dining 
the problem is access if you cant afford to wine and dine 
one feels lost said phil kaplan who lobbies on behalf of the 
poor in olympia wash 
and access is the name of the game 
to me access is the most important thing in the world said 
john larson chairman of the california fair political practices 
commission my god you give me two hours with the president of 
the united states thats all the access i would need 
not all entertaining is done at the dinner table 
in new mexico lobbyist truett gill spent 300 to stock snack 
items for house leaders in 1989 
utahs 29 senators and their families were invited to spend a 
free weekend at the deer valley ski resort last year and most them 
accepted while considering a tax exemption for capital 
improvements at ski areas the first attempt to pass the bill 
failed although a modified version later passed 
florida has a lobbyist known as the beer fairy a legislator 
announces he wants to have a party and someone leaves cases of 
beer anonymously at the doorstep 
florida lawmakers and their families also are offered a free 
trip to disney world every year at a cost of 200 to 2000 per 
lawmaker lawmakers recently passed a bill to prohibit customers 
from selling unused entrance tickets to the theme park but house 
rules chairman fred lippman said the trip had no bearing on his 
vote 
mickey minnie and goofy sure as hell dont convince us what 
to do with disney world lippman said

bob vila got kicked out of the house and 
decided to go home 
for 10 years vila was host of this old house the 
highestrated show on public television teaching viewers home 
renovation and remodeling techniques then he was fired for making 
too many commercials 
this fall hell be back on the job on commercial tv 
the new show is aptly named home again because in many 
ways it puts me back on tv where i started 10 11 years ago 
vila said from bvtv his production company in massachusetts im 
doing construction and remodeling stories that are relevant to the 
remodeling homeowner and home builder 
that wasnt the case on the emmy awardwinning this old 
house which spared no expense when it undertook costly 
renovation projects he said 
im sure our viewers were entertained and pleased to watch 
some of the costly jobs that we did but i could not relate to 
thousanddollar toilets and other gilded lilies vila said 
its always ironic that people in public television have that 
moneyisnoobject attitude he said 
with 15 million viewers this old house made vila a 
celebrity among doityourselfers he cashed in with a string of tv 
commercials for timelife books and various home improvement 
products 
that grated on his shows corporate underwriters and on bostons 
wgbhtv which produced the show the underwriters saw vila 
speaking for the competition wgbh said vila was hurting public 
tvs image 
to put it kindly he was nailed 
it was tough for me for three months said vila who found a 
new sponsor in sears roebuck and co 
home again syndicated by group w will air starting in 
september in 85 percent of the country including on network 
affiliate stations in 24 of the top 25 television markets 
as far as public television is concerned i gave them 10 great 
years of my life vila said i feel like ive done my duty for 
public tv 
he still is a commercial spokesman for timelife books and 
hell appear for sears line of craftsman tools and home 
improvement supplies but his other commercial ties vila said 
have lapsed 
home again will have a distinctly different flavor from 
this old house which continues on pbs 
vila and coproducer michael ferrone a former developer made 
13 episodes of home again building a house on cape cod for 50 
a square foot 
in the northeast 60 to 80 a square foot is reasonable vila 
said for fancy remodeling jobs featured in magazine layouts he 
said the cost is probably 100 a square foot 
vila said they kept costs down by doing drywall instead of 
skimcoat plaster pine flooring instead of oak by approaching 
everything with the budget in mind 
instead of master carpenter norm abrams who remains on pbs 
vila has a new sidekick in carpenter bob ryley of brewster mass 
its a happy circumstance because i didnt think hed be as 
good before the camera as he is a carpenter vila said he has 
a pixie irish quality that comes out nicely on the tube 
the seasons final 13 episodes will cover the renovation of a 
twostory graystone in the wicker park section of chicago 
which wont be confused with the affluent middleclass 
neighborhoods of this old house 
the neighborhood is certainly one thats in transition vila 
said its a wonderful mix of polish american blacks and 
hispanics 
whether theres a second season vila said will depend on the 
audience and the critics but he said hes not going to worry about 
the future 
i just feel like im home again with a better chance for an 
audience he said

brooding hulking towering 
fearsome wonderfully cavernous superbly sinister 
frighteningly big and mean 
these are some of the terrible things opera critics like to say 
about finnish bass matti salminen their words apply as well to his 
giantsize voice as to his menacing 6foot5 figure 
when i was young my voice was smaller and more lyrical 
salminen 45 said in a recent interview but i studied and 
worked hard and it grew 
thats an understatement as anyone can attest who has heard his 
thundering tones easily penetrate the 4000seat metropolitan opera 
house 
he was much in evidence there this spring singing in all four 
operas of wagners ring cycle he was the greedy giant fafner in 
das rheingold the cuckolded husband hunding in die 
walkuere fafner again in siegfried this time transformed 
into a sleeping dragon who is first awakened and then slain by the 
title character expiring to music that is so beautiful just 
like a schubert song and the villainous hagen who gives 
siegfried and bruennhilde a rough time of it in die 
goetterdaemmerung 
the last role is by far the biggest and most challenging 
hagens personality is vicious from the ground up but he is 
one of the most interesting characters in the whole ring 
salminen said even though he doesnt appear in the earlier 
operas his appearance is being built up to from the start 
hagen is the illegitimate son of alberich the dwarf whose theft 
of gold from the rhinemaidens causes all the trouble to begin with 
alberich loses his treasure to wotan king of the gods and spends 
the rest of the cycle scheming to get it back where the cringing 
cowardly father fails the daring dastardly son almost succeeds 
from alberichs weakness all of a sudden comes a strong 
figure salminen said he manipulates everyone he has 
incredible slyness 
salminen plays hagen to the hilt his voice brims with malice as 
he plots to ruin the heroic lovers and insinuates his way into 
their confidence the pleasure he takes in his own scheming is 
evident from the gleam in his eye and the way he struts about the 
stage its a performance that has earned him unanimous raves from 
the reviewers 
his hagen will be one of the highlights of the public 
broadcasting services telecast of the mets ring cycle 
production on four consecutive nights june 1821 he also will be 
heard as fafner but hunding will be sung by german bass kurt moll 
wagner has played a major part in salminens career he first 
came to international prominence in 1976 as hunding and the giant 
fasolt at the centennial production by patrice chereau at bayreuth 
west germany 
his met debut was a triumph in the role of king marke in 
wagners tristan und isolde whose 20minute monologue usually 
puts audiences to sleep last season he sang daland in wagners 
der fliegende hollaender he has also performed such 
nonwagnerian parts as the comic villain osmin in mozarts 
abduction from the seraglio and rocco the jailer in beethovens 
fidelio 
yet it rankles him that his met career is not more varied in 
europe he gets to portray the title role in mussorgskys boris 
godunov and phillip ii in verdis don carlos 
the met tells me they really only want me for the german 
repertory salminen said with a sigh here im allowed to sing 
ramfis the priest in verdis aida but thats not much 
compensation 
salminen who is married and has two children has a home in 
zurich switzerland and also one in helsinki finland 
he grew up in the town of turko where at age 17 he won an 
amateur singing contest four years later he was singing in the 
finnish national opera chorus and appearing there in small roles 
such as charles v in don carlos and monterone in rigoletto 
in 1969 he went to rome to study with vocal coach luigi ricci and 
his career took off in the early 1970s 
he is just one of several finnish singers who have made names 
for themselves abroad in recent years others include baritone 
jorma hynninen soprano karita mattila and the late bass martti 
talvela whom salminen mourns as a father figure to all us 
finnish singers 
salminen said part of the reason they were driven to seek 
international careers was the lack of a finnish opera house 
suitable for major productions 
in a country of 5 million people we have had only one tiny 
house that with great trouble could squeeze maybe six or eight 
violins into the orchestra pit he said so if you wanted to do 
something you had to go outside 
he now sings every summer at the savonlinna festival in finland 
and looks forward to being involved with a new national opera house 
scheduled to open in helsinki in 1993 
he will not appear at the met next season but will be back in 
199192 for ramfis daland rocco osmin and the commendatore in 
mozarts don giovanni

vice chairman gerald greenwald left chrysler may 30 to head a 
threeunion bid to buy united airlines for 454 billion michael 
hammes vice president for international operations left earlier 
in may to head black amp decker corps toolmaking operation 
chrysler treasurer frederick zuckerman has said he plans to 
leave this summer 
because of those departures and bidwells expected retirement 
iacocca said late last week he would stay on past the dec 8 1991 
expiration of his fouryear contract it is unclear how long 
iacocca will remain chairman and chief executive officer 
the executive exodus has left few in line for iacoccas job the 
main contenders are robert s miller who took over greenwalds 
title and many of his duties and robert lutz who assumed a few of 
greenwalds responsibilities but had no change in his title of 
president of chrysler motors 
the departures come as chrysler struggles to recapture profit 
and market share 
the company earned 71 million in the first quarter of this 
year down 80 percent from a year ago and is believed to have lost 
money on its core automaking operations analysts dont expect any 
significant earnings improvement until the fourth quarter of this 
year 
last october chrysler began a 15 billion costcutting 
program which included a reduction in the whitecollar work force 
of about 2500 people 
at the end of last month chryslers share of the us car 
market stood at 83 percent down from 96 percent a year earlier 
its share of the light truck market slipped to 204 percent from 
216 percent 
the financial problems have led to speculation that chrysler 
could become the target of a takeover offer or stake purchase by 
some overseas automaker such as fiat spa of italy or mitsubishi 
motors corp of japan

a freetrade pact between the united states 
and mexico should spur an increase in investment in mexico and make 
the country a potent competitor to the newly industrialized 
countries of asia analysts said 
figures recently issued by the us department of labor showed 
that in 1987 the most recent year for which overall figures were 
available it cost manufacturers 157 an hour to hire a worker in 
mexico that compared with 179 in south korea 212 in hong 
kong 231 in singapore and 1340 in this country 
in addition to low wages mexicos proximity to the united 
states gives it an advantage over asian and european competitors in 
lower transport costs said nora lustig a former consultant to the 
mexican government and a visiting fellow at the brookings 
institution 
she said she expected to see more industry develop in northern 
mexico near the us border she saw textiles and electronics as 
two areas where mexico has much to offer investors 
ms lustig and ernest l preeg a former state department trade 
specialist who holds a chair in international business at the 
center for strategic and international studies said prospects of a 
freetrade pact would pay immediate psychological dividends even if 
a treaty takes time to iron out 
investment is likely to increase as business people are 
reassured by the prospect of steady sales in the huge us market 
for the mexican goods they said 
in addition to us and canadian investors companies in other 
industrial countries will want to start manufacturing in a place 
where costs are low and restrictions will be few on sales to the 
united states preeg said confidence stemming from freetrade 
prospects also could bring home some of the tens of billions of 
dollars wealthy mexicans have stashed abroad he said 
the two analysts saw broad advantages for both mexico and the 
united states from a freetrade agreement the two countries want 
to see more jobs created in mexico so more mexicans will stay at 
home instead of migrating legally or illegally to the united 
states 
ms lustig said a treaty would give us companies a chance to 
boost sales of machinery to equip the new factories in mexico and 
the possibility of making products such as auto parts more cheaply 
than at home 
not everyone sees the prospects so favorably last week lane 
kirkland head of the aflcio and shirley carr head of the 
canadian labor congress foresaw more unemployment in the united 
states and canada from a usmexico free trade agreement 
the council on henispheric affairs another private study group 
predicted that foreign companies would exploit mexican labor and 
invest their earnings in other countries

televisions weekly look at business will be shown this fall on 
soviet television dubbed in russian according to the new york 
times 
the export of the show produced by alvin h perlmutter inc and 
public tv station wnet appears to be another example of the 
soviets increased acceptance of capitalism american shows are 
rarely found on soviet tv

shows host referring to his namesake the 18thcentury scottish 
economist who formulated the theories of capitalism 
in interviews published tuesday the shows host whose real 
name is george jw goodman and his soviet colleagues said much of 
the information presented on the program would be beyond the 
typical soviet viewers comprehension 
i think theres enormous confusion because the signals arent 
clear there as they go to a market economy

distributes films will get the broadcast rights to money 
world and will sell 90 seconds of advertising to us companies 
doing business in the soviet union those companies include general

foxboro co a leading international maker of 
manufacturing control systems says it is looking at what it termed 
an alliance with other firms that could include the sale of the 
company 
the announcement monday came amid speculation that began last 
week about a possible takeover of foxboro the talk drove up 
foxboros stock which closed monday at 30 a share up 150 in 
new york stock exchange composite trading 
a week ago the stock sold for 24 a share last year it traded 
as low as 1862 said albert turner a securities analyst at duff 
amp phelps in chicago 
foxboro systems are used to record and control processes in 
manufacturing such as temperature pressure humidity and liquid 
levels its customers are largely in the chemical and petroleum 
industries and include such familiar names as exxon corp and dow 
chemical co 
the international company based in the suburb of foxboro 
employs 7000 people the company reported a net loss for 1989 of 
46 million or 37 cents a share on sales of 598 million 
in a brief announcement the company said it was exploring 
alternatives with respect to a possible strategic alliance with a 
limited number of firms 
such an alliance it said could add complementary strengths 
to the companys existing strong process control capability 
the deal it is exploring the company added could involve an 
equity investment in all or a substantial portion of its stock 
it also said however that no decision had been made on whether 
such a deal might even transpire 
telephone calls to john c fuller a member of the foxboro board 
and a vice president for investor relations were not returned 
foxboro would be an attractive buy turner said among its 
attributes are an old and loyal customer base and a new product 
line first offered two years ago that enables foxboro systems to be 
integrated with those of other companies 
but the new system has had costly bugs in it turner said 
its not clear that all of the problems have been completely 
worked out in this new system and this company has had to borrow 
money to finance its operations in the last four years turner 
said they could use a little financial backing 
robert sullivan an analyst at painewebber inc in new york 
said foxboro is coming out of a restructuring period 
the companys record in the last few years has been quite 
erratic which has led to some dissatisfaction on the part of some 
stockholders sullivan said 
its a big and growing market and as manufacturing companies 
are forced by law to reduce pollution one of the things they will 
be forced to spend money on is equipment to reduce pollution 
sullivan said

the government plans to link the pound to europes 
exchange rate mechanism in the fourth quarter of this year the 
financial times reported tuesday 
the newspaper said treasury officials have decided recently that 
britains underlying annual inflation rate will be low enough 
toward years end to allow the pound to enter the european monetary 
systems exchange rate mechanism 
the underlying inflation rate is now about 625 percent and the 
full rate including mortgage payments is 94 percent 
a spokesman for prime minister margaret thatchers office said 
the financial times report was pure speculation 
mrs thatcher said at a european community summit last june that 
britain would link the pound once british inflation is nearer the 
community average now about 5 percent and there is free movement 
of capital in the community 
the exchange rate mechanism links nine of the 12 currencies of 
the community to prevent wide swings in rates 
in a statement to parliament on thursday chancellor of the 
exchequer john major said the government will calculate its 
inflation in a way similar to methods used by other community 
nations 
his remarks were taken to mean that the treasury would strip out 
such things as the mortgage interest payments from the british 
index 
major also said significant progress has been made toward 
meeting mrs thatchers conditions but british inflation was still 
too high compared with the ec average 
the financial times said the specific timing of the pounds 
entry into the exchange rate mechanism will depend on sterling 
staying strong against other european currencies putting the pound 
into the system at a high level would help control inflation 
the newspaper said the government considers it wiser to join the 
mechanism on condition that the pound be allowed to move within a 6 
percent band rather than the 225 percent band to which most of 
the systems currencies are limited

chrysler corp and the french 
automaker renault announced today that they have abandoned their 
joint venture in developing and building a new sportutility 
vehicle 
the arcad joint venture formed in february 1989 is no longer 
economically attractive the automakers said in a written 
statement chrysler spokesman tom houston declined to elaborate 
arcad was to begin producing a vehicle codenamed jj in the 
second half of 1992 at a valladolid spain plant leased from 
renaults spanish subsidiary the fourwheeldrive vehicles were to 
be marketed worldwide except in north america where arcad planned 
to build them at an existing chrysler facility 
chrysler intends to develop the jj project on its own but a 
north american plant still has not been selected houston said 
the decision to terminate arcad was not affected by mondays 
vote on a new sevenyear contract by workers at chryslers two 
jeep plants in toledo ohio houston said members of local 12 of 
the united auto workers union approved the contract by an 
80percent margin 
chrysler has said uaw contract approval was among the steps 
needed for it to bring new production to toledo the jj was 
believed to be among the vehicles chrysler was planning to build 
there 
local 12 officials did not immediately respond to word that 
chrysler and renault terminated arcad 
the automakers had budgeted 500 million for arcad but houston 
could not say how much of that was spent arcad production levels 
never were established he said 
renault will continue distributing chryslers jeep vehicles in 
europe the statement said

donald trumps major bankers are betting the 
king of glitzy casinos and real estate can strengthen his 
cashstrapped empire under a tentative debt restructuring deal 
but some analysts say the flamboyant developer whose marital as 
well as financial troubles have been gossiptabloid fodder may 
have to pay dearly for the breathing room by giving creditors 
greater control over his holdings 
several major banks agreed over the weekend to extend 60 
million in new loans to trump and suspend interest payments on 2 
billion in outstanding debt banking sources familiar with the 
talks said monday 
in exchange trump promised to pledge as collateral some of his 
remaining real estate and casino assets that arent otherwise 
committed to secure loans said the sources who spoke on condition 
they not be named 
those assets include the trump plaza hotel in atlantic city 
nj and the trump tower building in manhattan they said 
trump also may have agreed to forfeit equity in other properties 
in return for the suspension of interest payments and to make 
changes in his lavish highprofile lifestyle according to a 
report in mondays wall street journal which first reported on the 
tentative bank deal 
but the journal article said trump balked at a bank proposal to 
secure the 60 million loan with the apartment portfolio of his 
father fred trump who amassed a fortune in real estate and first 
taught the junior trump the art of the deal 
the banks hope to give trump more time to restructure his 
operations while he waits out new york citys real estate slump and 
the downturn in the atlantic city gambling market analysts said 
without the extra breathing room trump could be forced to sell 
some of his major assets at bargain prices 
by delaying any sale they believe this is a way of maximizing 
the probability of being paid back said richard mueller an 
analyst with duff amp phelps inc 
christopher mahoney of moodys investors service inc agreed 
the banks cant say to him if you cant pay please sell your 
buildings today and give us the cash the buildings would sell for 
a lot less and he could go bankrupt 
the banks would end up owning the buildings the last thing 
they want to do is manage casinos 
jim mcdermott an analyst with keefe bruyette amp woods said that 
while the restructuring keeps trump out of bankruptcy court it 
places him under tighter control of his creditors 
id say he doesnt have as much autonomy as he did 
yesterday mcdermott said 
sources familiar with the negotiations said major banks 
contributions toward the 60 million loan will be proportionate to 
the amount they previously lent citicorp and bankers trust would 
provide around twothirds of the new loan 
sources said the next step is to sell the restructuring plan to 
smaller creditors including japanese banks which reportedly 
purchased part of trumps loans through syndication 
citicorp bankers trust chase manhattan and manufacturers 
hanover had scheduled a meeting monday with about 10 additional 
banks sources said 
if any one of the other banks do not go along then the deal 
does not work the journal quoted one unidentified banker as 
saying 
spokesmen for the banks and trump declined to comment officially 
on the deal 
trump confirmed last week that he was negotiating with the 
banks who reportedly were concerned about his ability to handle 
the billions in debt run up in buying big real estate and casino 
properties 
the huge trump taj mahal in atlantic city has been a drain on 
his cash flow as have interest payments on roughly 1 billion in 
junk bonds he issued to finance the purchase of hotels and the 
trump shuttle airline 
the daily news reported today that the taj mahal failed last 
week to take in a daily average of 1 million the amount needed to 
earn a profit it was the first week since the casinos april 
opening that the target wasnt hit 
if the smaller creditors support the proposal trump likely 
would be able to meet an interest payment due friday on the bonds 
for trumps castle casino 
the journal said some bankers were concerned that if trump 
missed a payment on the bonds it would jeopardize the gambling 
licenses for all three of his casinos 
news of the restructuring agreement triggered a rally in the 
price of trumps bonds monday the bonds were hammered by word of 
the bank talks last week and some bonds trade for as little as 60 
percent of face value

earnings at the nations 12588 commercial 
banks bounced back in the first three months of 1990 after two soft 
quarters the government said today 
despite heavy losses on real estate loans in the northeast 
banks overall earned 62 billion in the januarymarch period 
according to the federal deposit insurance corp that was a 
substantial improvement over profits of 21 billion in the fourth 
quarter of 1989 and a loss of 700 million in the third quarter 
however firstquarter earnings were still down 15 percent from 
the record 73 billion during the same period a year ago 
l william seidman chairman of the fdic which insures bank 
deposits said the relatively good performance should continue this 
year 
we dont see any precipitous change up or down he said 
while overall results are good seidman noted that banks in a 
growing number of states are experiencing problems with real estate 
loans the level of sour real estate loans as a percentage of all 
real estate loans grew in 39 states and the district of columbia 
nationally banks continue to rely on real estate lending to 
support overall growth total real estate loans grew by 75 
billion or 11 percent in the 12 months ending march 31 
during the same period delinquent real estate loans grew by 7 
billion or 40 percent 
on the positive side the fdic reported that fewer banks are 
failing than last year thirtysix failed in the first quarter 
compared with 64 during the same period of 1989 
the number of problem banks those in danger of failure 
declined to 1058 in the first quarter from 1289 in the same 
period a year ago 
seidman said the insurance fund backing bank deposits which 
suffered losses in 1988 and 1989 should post a modest profit this 
year 
the fdic revised its report for 1989 bank profits to 157 
billion down 600 million from an earlier report it attributed 
the revision to belated recognition of loan losses

federal law should be changed to allow 
consumers not private credit reporting bureaus to control the 
use of their credit records a house subcommittee was told today 
credit records are more than just account numbers they are a 
consumers reputation rep matthew rinaldo rnj told the 
house banking subcommittee on consumer affairs 
the panel is considering ways to update the 20yearold fair 
credit reporting act to keep up with major advances in computer 
technology that have made credit reporting a booming business 
rinaldo sponsor of one of three proposed bills said credit 
reports should be provided only for transactions initiated by 
consumers not for such things as directmail marketing mailing 
lists or preapproved lines of credit 
however jean noonan associate director of the federal trade 
commissions bureau of consumer protection said that although 
there is a danger that use of credit reports can be an invasion of 
privacy her office would rather regulate it than ban it 
subcommittee chairman richard lehman dcalif has proposed 
allowing credit reports to be used for solicitation if consumers 
are allowed to bar their own files from such use 
rep charles schumer dny is sponsoring a proposal similar 
to rinaldos to ban such use of consumer credit files 
rep john hiler rind ranking minority member of the 
subcommittee said the proposals went too far 
we also have to be concerned that we do not shut off the flow 
of credit to all but the most goldplated credit risks hiler 
said 
bonnie guiton director of the us office of consumer affairs 
opposed proposals to require credit reporting companies to provide 
customers a free annual copy of their credit record the consumers 
will end up paying the cost she said adding that credit companies 
instead should have to conduct random checks on their own work and 
publish the results 
the various proposals also include language to give consumers 
new power to correct errors in their credit reports and require 
that they be notified when their credit report is used to deny them 
a transaction 
on monday a louis harris amp associates poll reported that 71 
percent of those americans surveyed believe consumers have lost 
control over how businesses handle personal information about their 
customers 
consumers want the fair credit reporting act updated to guard 
against misuse of personal information said alan f westin the 
columbia university professor who conducted the survey 
but westin said consumers were willing to make a fair 
information bargain with the government and industry so they can 
still have access to conveniences such as directmail and credit 
cards 
consumers want it all he said they want both privacy and 
they want the benefits of a consumer society 
the survey was commissioned by equifax an atlantabased company 
that provides information and technology to businesses including 
employers insurers and credit companies 
it found that 79 percent of those questioned were either very 
concerned or somewhat concerned about threats to their personal 
privacy compared with 77 percent in a 1983 harris survey and 64 
percent in a 1978 poll 
in 1970 only 34 percent said they were concerned about privacy 
issues 
a large majority said privacy should be considered a fundamental 
right and 30 percent said they had decided against applying for a 
job credit or insurance because they didnt want to provide 
certain kinds of information about themselves the survey found 
but 78 percent said they would be upset if they couldnt get 
credit based on their record of paying bills 
the random telephone poll included 2254 interviews in january 
and february and 2253 interviews in april with about half of the 
first group of people being reinterviewed the margin of error was 
plus or minus 2 percentage points

the european community on tuesday submitted a 
proposal to liberalize trade in textiles and clothing by phasing 
out an existing agreement that regulates commerce in the 
politically sensitive sector 
the ec plan presented to members of the 96nation general 
agreement on tariffs and trade aims at bringing trade in textiles 
into conformity with gatts free trade principles 
the sector has for the past 30 years been governed by the 
multifiber arrangement which provides for quotas negotiated on a 
bilateral basis the current mfa is due to expire in july 1991 
world trade in textiles totalled 89 billion in 1988 while the 
clothing sector was worth some 88 billion according to figures 
from the genevabased gatt secretariat 
the ec plan proposes that most existing mfa quotas should be 
gradually enlarged by a given percentage before they are finally 
abolished according to trade officials 
however the ec also said it was prepared to negotiate a list of 
some products that could be brought into the gatt before the 
transition period begins 
the 12nation trading bloc did not set a timetable for 
liberalizing trade or specify the pace at which quotas should be 
increased during the transition period trade officials said 
one source who declined to be identified said some negotiators 
at the meeting criticized the proposals for being too imprecise 
the ec plan to start from the basis of the existing mfa 
contrasts with the us approach the united states wants to 
abandon the mfa when it expires next year and introduce a new 
10year global quota system critics of the american plan argue 
that washington is seeking to introduce new restrictions through 
this scheme in order to placate its powerful textile lobby which 
fears competition from third world exporters 
the 22nation international textiles and clothing bureau which 
represents major third world producers is due to present a 
proposal on wednesday to phase out restrictions on their exports 
within six years 
new rules on textiles are due to be resolved in december when 
the fouryear uruguay round of negotiations is scheduled to end

in a survey of american perceptions of 
marketplace values which came first the chicken or the lawyer 
the chicken not only won by a large margin it placed first in 
the study while lawyers fees came in next to the bottom edged out 
for the very worst rating by hospital charges 
the healthcare area in general received low consumer acceptance 
marks but the legal professions activities might have something 
to do with that too 
high healthcare costs explained fabian linden head of the 
conference boards consumer research center have an important 
legal component primarily in the form of high malpractice 
insurance costs 
the survey was conducted for the board by national family 
opinion inc of toledo ohio as part of an ongoing study of 
consumer confidence every second month said linden there is room 
for special studies such as this one 
generally speaking the consumer acceptance ratings for late in 
1989 showed little change from those of other years except perhaps 
to show some slippage when compared to two or three years earlier 
there were few surprises as before consumers expressed a 
relatively high level of satisfaction with foods purchased for home 
consumption including poultry meat fish fruits and vegetables 
they thought rather highly of the values in video rentals 
television sets appliances haircuts electricity telephone 
service restaurant meals and although the ultimate consumer was 
not questioned pet food 
accompanying hospital charges and lawyers fees at the lower end 
of the chart were credit card charges premium pay television 
health insurance movies at theaters admission to sports events 
and automobile insurance 
contrary to some popular opinions that older people are more 
difficult to satisfy the survey showed little difference in the 
attitudes of young and old and says linden surprising 
similarities were found through all income levels 
the survey did reveal significant attitudinal differences in 
regard to foreign versus domestic cars 
despite impressions that consumers prefer foreign makes they 
rated them only a bit higher than domestic cars but differences 
became sharper with age foreign cars scored better with the young 
domestic models with older people 
foreign cars also scored better on the east and west coasts 
which linden attributes to concentrations of younger people while 
domestic models rated higher in much of the remainder of the nation 
one of the best foreigncar ratings was in the northeast where 
said linden young workers in the financial industries often earned 
embarassingly large sums of money and sought to use those sums 
conspicuously 
in all the levels of consumer acceptance are perhaps close to 
what most people think they are 
in the middle range of relative acceptance for example are 
such items as us postage furniture prescription drugs dry 
cleaning lowermiddle includes mass transit hotel stays air 
fares toys highermiddle includes mens shoes men and womens 
apparel personal care and eyeglasses 
and what level is occupied by used cars so often considered one 
of the more questionable values in the american markeplace 
true they were low in the consumer acceptance ratings below 
home repairs and appliance repairs but higher in acceptability 
than bank service charges 
and considerably higher than those lawyers fees and hospital 
charges

overseas 
after seeing these figures im confident that possibly as 
early as july we could see a widening in japans trade surplus 
said jesper koll an economist at sg warburg securities 
bank of tokyo economist toshio yamasaki said a weaker domestic 
economy will encourage companies to ship their products abroad 
lower oil prices also reduced the value of japans imports in 
may its crude oil imports increased 31 percent in volume but 
dropped 4 percent in value terms to 171 billion japanese 
importers paid an average of 1679 a barrel for crude oil in may 
down from 1802 a year earlier

otaiba on tuesday urged oilproducing countries within opec and out 
of it to cooperate in an effort to stabilize the world petroleum 
market 
at a news conference held with egypts oil minister abdelhadi 
kandeel otaiba said an emergecy opec conference would be held as 
soon as needed 
he stressed the importance for all opec countries to abide by 
the cartels decisions and cited as an example the uae which he 
said reduced its daily petroleum production quota to 19 million 
barrels from 21 million barrels 
the uaes 19 million quota is still far above its opecdecreed 
ceiling of 1095 in may however the uae was reportedly producing 
205 million barrels a day 
despite an opec agreement in geneva on may 2 to limit overall 
production to 221226 million barrels a day production last 
month remained high at an estimated 2368 million barrels a day 
the middle east economic survey reported monday the newsletter 
singled out kuwait and the uae as producing well above their quotas 
set by the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
mees said the average spot price for seven opec crudes dropped 
to 1545 a barrel in may from 1563 a barrel in april 
significantly lower than the cartels benchmark price of 18 per 
barrel 
otaiba said preparation for a new opec ministerial conference 
has begun and if neccessity calls for such an emergency 
conference it will be held 
otaiba said he expects the current oil market crisis to end in 
two months following efforts and contacts among opec and nonopec 
oil producing countries 
i have great hope that we can control the temporary crisis and 
overcome the terror gripping the market he said

the us dollar ended narrowly mixed in europe on

the dollar continued to trade in wellestablished ranges 
dealers said 
andrew ellott international foreign exchange salesman for chase 
manhattan bank in london said he doesnt expect the dollar to 
break out of its current trading ranges until fridays release of 
us trade figures 
most of the markets interest was focused on a rush to buy 
sterling against most other currencies which pushed the pound to 
its highest level on a tradeweighted basis since late september 
although it reached only a fourmonth peak against the dollar 
the buying was prompted by a financial times reported tuesday 
that treasury officials have decided recently that britains 
underlying annual inflation rate will be low enough toward the end 
of the year to allow the pound to enter europes exchange rate 
mechanism in the fourth quarter 
a spokesman for prime minister margaret thatchers office said

agriculture department crop report said john frazier director of 
agricultural commodities trading for gerald inc

planted as of sunday compared with 88 percent a week ago 96 
percent a year ago and the fiveyear average of 99 percent

among other blue chip stocks traded on the nyse ibm was up lsqb to 
120 after slipping slightly early in the day american exrter was a bit 
of a false dawn wyss said 
even with the quarters improvement the united states is 
beginning the 1990s in a far different position from the beginning 
of the 1980s a decade ago america was the largest creditor 
nation it ran surpluses in its current account as the earnings on 
overseas investments were enough to offset perennial deficits in 
merchandise trade 
but as americans handed over billions of dollars to foreigners 
in payments for imported cars and televisions the investment 
cushion eroded it disappeared altogether in 1985 when the united 
states became a net debtor for the first time in 71 years 
that means foreigners now own more in us assets than americans 
own overseas a development that has led some to say the united 
states is losing control over its economic destiny 
tuesdays report indicates americas debtor position has now 
risen to around 670 billion although the governments official 
accounting of the gap between us holdings and foreign investments 
will not be released for several more weeks 
brad larschan an attorney with the association for 
international investment a lobbying group for foreign companies 
doing business in the united states said there was a growing push 
in congress to restrict foreign investment which he termed an 
unfortunate development given americas continued need to 
finance the shortfall in its current account position with foreign 
borrowing 
we are concerned about the rising protectionism in congress 
and throughout the country larschan said in a political 
sense this is open season on foreign investors this is coming at 
a time when the united states is scrambling to compete with other 
countries for investment capital 
for the first three months of the year the merchandise trade 
deficit narrowed by 82 percent to 2637 billion as an alltime 
high in us export sales offset the highest volume of oil imports 
in more than 12 years 
the surplus in the investment category rose by 83 percent to 
608 million while the surplus in the services category which 
covers such things as foreign tourist spending in the united states 
and banking and insurance earnings by us companies operating 
overseas rose 31 percent to 631 billion 
the fourth category in the current account unilateral 
transfers covers us foreign aid payments and pension benefits 
paid to americans living overseas it shrank by 25 percent to 349 
billion in the first quarter 
the sum of the various categories equals the current account 
figure of 2294 billion for the first quarter

a new york stock exchange report released today 
proposed more widespread use of trading halts to curb stockprice 
volatility and recommended tighter regulatory control over 
financial markets to raise investor confidence 
the report capped a sixmonth study into the reasons for 
unwieldy markets which have dogged the securities industry since 
the market collapse of october 1987 and have been partly blamed for 
a declining interest in stock ownership by individual investors 
but the nyses conclusions didnt significantly differ than 
other studies into the causes of wild price swings they also found 
nothing inherently wrong with program trading the computerized 
strategy of instantly buying or selling large quantities of stocks 
which some critics have blamed for exaggerating movements in prices 
and frightening investors off 
we found that the markets are essentially stable and sound 
and that they are not tilted against the individual investor 
said general motors corp chairman roger b smith who headed the 
18member blueribbon panel on market volatility and investor 
confidence 
there is however ample room for improvement particularly in 
increasing public understanding of markets and how they have 
changed in recent years he said 
smith and fellow panelists spoke at a news conference at nyse 
headquarters where the longawaited study was released the 
markets failure to react to its conclusions suggested that people 
in the securities industry found nothing threatening about them 
i dont think thats a primary concern right now said 
philip rettew a senior market analyst for merrill lynch amp co the 
nations biggest securities company the market cares more about 
the economic numbers 
among the nyse proposals was a fourtier circuit breaker 
that would halt trading for an hour when the dow jones industrial 
average moves up or down 100 points from the previous days close 
90 minutes when it moves 200 points and two hours when it moves at 
least 300 points 
the proposed halts are for longer periods than previous 
temporary circuit breakers enacted by the nyse to control potential 
panic in the market 
the panel was formed after the 190point plunge by the dow 
industrials last oct 13 which began with word that a takeover 
offer for the parent of united airlines had collapsed some experts 
have said that single event combined with speculative selling and 
program trading destabilized the market 
the nyse study concluded that market volatility and program 
trading are not the primary concern of individual investors who 
are more concerned about whether todays markets are operated 
fairly and honestly 
nonetheless it said the belief that program trading has 
diminished the fairness of markets reduces investor confidence 
other recommendations in the nyse report include better systems 
to detect intermarket trading abuses a loosening of constraints on 
corporations ability to buy their own stock during volatile

daphne pourhappen is have a group of 60 to 90yearold people 
going out and weightlifting because of the risk of injury 
herling said by telephone she said elderly people who want to lift 
weights should consult a physician 
during the study conducted in the summer of 1988 six women and 
four men participated in an eightweek weighttraining program that 
focused on the quadriceps muscle at the front of the thigh 
three times a week for eight weeks the subjects performed leg 
lifts with weights for about 45 minutes a session 
by the end of the eightweek training period all nine subjects 
who completed the study had at least doubled the amount of weight 
they could lift and some had tripled and quadrupled that amount 
fiatarone said 
the average increase in singleleg exercises went from 16 pounds 
at the beginning to about 42 pounds by the end of the training she 
said in a telephone interview 
one 86yearold man stopped after four weeks because of pain at 
the site of a previous hernia the rest completed the training with 
little pain and no injuries the researchers said 
they called the results remarkable considering the subjects 
age and poor health condition at the start of the study seven had 
arthritis six had heart disease and four had hypertension 
the subjects stopped weightlifting at the end of the eightweek 
period and four weeks later they had lost about onethird of the 
strength they had gained fiatarone said 
a similar loss would be expected in a younger person she said 
noting that for the results to be lasting weighttraining must be 
done on a longterm basis 
although the study focused only on leg muscles fiatarone said 
it can be assumed weighttraining also would strengthen upperbody 
muscles in the elderly 
the researcher said the results indicate that weighttraining 
can be used in the elderly to help them gain strength and possibly 
avoid the falls and other accidents associated with weakness 
but herling said more research is needed to determine if 
weighttraining strengthens upperbody muscles in the very old 
adding that those muscles tend to be the weakest in the elderly 
but she also said that the study certainly sheds new light on 
the capabilities that these elderly patients can achieve and 
thats promising

hardees announced a new leaner 
quarterpound hamburger tuesday but competitors said the fastfood 
company is playing catch up 
the rocky mountbased company announced the lean 1 a 
quarterpound burger with an average of 18 grams of total fat that 
it described as the lowestfat burger in the business 
the response from competitor wendys was a little frosty 
this really isnt news as far as were concerned although we 
applaud the efforts of people trying to bring more nutritious food 
to the public said charlie rath vice president for marketing at 
the dublin ohiobased company 
rath said wendys quarterpound single hamburger has 15 grams of 
fat lower than any of the competitors 
not so said cori zywotow a spokeswoman for burger king in 
miami her companys comparable hamburger had 11 grams of fat she 
said 
you really need to listen to consumers and have a variety we 
certainly work to please our customers ms zywotow said in a 
telephone interview 
fat content and other healthrelated issues have received more 
attention from fastfood companies in recent years due to 
heightened consumer awareness and activism 
officials at mcdonalds corp the nations biggest fastfood 
restaurant chain had no comment tuesday afternoon on the hardees 
announcement but hardees spokesman john merritt threw down the 
kitchen glove to any and all challengers 
if anybody wants to do a comparison ill pay any 
independent laboratory for the testing and bet 1000 to any one of 
those groups that our lean burger is the lowest fat product on the 
market merritt said 
he said that by percentage hardees quarterpound hamburger 
boasted a 179 percent fat ratio that compared with 228 percent 
for wendys and 225 percent for burger king according to figures 
from testing by hardees he said 
the major chains already have taken other moves to educate 
customers or offer foods with less saturated fat which has been 
found to raise the risk of heart disease 
mcdonalds said last friday it would post complete nutritional 
information including fat and sodium levels on all of its 
products at its restaurants this summer 
mcdonalds also has said it is experimenting with using pure 
vegetable oil rather than the current beef shorteningvegetable 
oil mixture for frying its french fries and hash browns 
hardees prepared statement released tuesday said it was the 
first chain to introduce a nonbreaded nonfried chicken sandwich 
on its menu more than two years ago hardees switched to 
allvegetable oil to cook its french fries 
burger king is testing the use of vegetable oil and has a 
grilled chicken sandwich 
all of the four big chains offer salads

alcatel nv to its partner in the french telecommunications 
equipment manufacturing joint venture for 640 million 
the sale of the stake to frances compagnie generale 
delectricite will reduce itts ownership in alcatel to 30 percent 
which was the level itt sought to own in the 1986 negotiations on 
forming the joint venture 
but in order to assure completion of the deal which created the 
worlds biggest maker of telecommunications equipment itt in 1986 
agreed to take a 37 percent interest in alcatel 
itt will report an aftertax gain of about 139 million from the 
transaction which is expected to close on june 14 the gain will 
be included in itts secondquarter earnings the company said in a

million shares 
rand v araskog itts chairman and chief executive and also 
chairman of alcatels supervisory board said itts investment in 
alcatel has grown handsomely since the parisbased venture began

years and our board of directors is pleased not only with this 
outstanding appreciation of our investment but also with the 
positive working relationship developed between itt and cge he

the sale of 7 percent of alcatel will allow itt to realize a 
return from this increased value while retaining a substantial 
ownership position to take advantage of growth projected for 
alcatel in the future he said

chrysler corp and french automaker renault on 
tuesday terminated a joint venture to build a small sportutility 
vehicle but chrysler said it planned to continue developing the 
project 
chrysler spokesman tom houston said the company which saw its 
first quarter profit drop by 80 percent decided the arcad project 
is no longer economically attractive 
chrysler intends to continue with the jj project and is 
reviewing various implementation alternatives houston said 
declining to disclose details his statement indicated the company 
may be considering developing the vehicle by itself or with another 
partner 
the collapse of the 500 million arcad joint venture could delay 
chryslers plans to expand in europe which is seen as a 
potentially huge market once internal trade barriers are lifted in 
1992 and former east bloc nations continue liberalizing their 
economies 
arcad was to begin producing the vehicle codenamed jj in 
the second half of 1992 at a valladolid spain plant leased from 
renaults spanish subsidiary 
the fourwheeldrive vehicles were to be marketed worldwide 
except in north america where arcad planned to build them at an 
existing chrysler facility 
during the past year chrysler has shown signs of growing in 
europe where it has had little presence in the past the company 
recently signed a deal to build minivans in austria 
last week general motors corp announced a joint venture with 
volga auto works of the soviet union gm executives said the 
project to provide fuel system components represented their 
entrance to a potentially huge marketplace 
it appears unlikely that production of the jj could begin in 
north america before late 1992 the original target date of the 
arcad agreement 
arcad had not said where north american production would be 
located but speculation surrounded chryslers jeep plant in 
toledo ohio 
on monday members of united auto workers union local 12 in 
toledo approved a new local labor agreement seen as key to bringing 
production of the jj and the jeep wrangler now made in canada 
to the aging factory 
the jj would be built in pieces by suppliers and shipped to 
an assembly plant said joseph phillippi an auto industry analyst 
for shearson lehman hutton in new york 
there is no stamping no machining no painting he said 
because of potential that the jj would have to be priced low to 
fight competition from the geo tracker suzuki sidekick and 
daihatsu rocky pervehicle profit would be relatively low 
phillippi said 
chrysler has been getting most of its profits from sales of its 
minivans and its jeep line which it acquired with the purchase of 
american motors corp in august 1987 
but recently chryslers profits have been falling its sales 
have been slipping and toplevel executives have been leaving 
the company earned 359 million last year down 658 percent 
from 1988 profits through the first five months of this year 
chrysler had sold 713883 cars and trucks down 128 percent from 
last year 
four top level executives including former vice chairman gerald 
greenwald recently have announced they were leaving chrysler or 
would do so by yeard end

the department of transport said tuesday that 
talks continued between the united states and britain on allowing 
each others airlines to fly to more cities and the times of 
london said an agreement was near 
although a department spokesman said there was no indication of 
a resolution soon the times reported that the countries have 
nearly completed a deal under which american airlines northwest 
airlines and delta air lines would obtain rights to fly to 
manchester england from chicago boston and atlanta 
respectively all three already fly to manchester from other cities 
the airlines would be given the opportunity to vary those 
routes and they also would be allowed to fly on to paris and 
frankfurt if france and west germany agree the newspaper said 
without identifying its source 
in return virgin atlantic airways of great britain would be 
allowed to fly from londons gatwick airport to boston the 
newspaper said and british airways and other british airlines 
would be allowed to fly to major american cities from any regional 
airport in britain 
talks began more than a year ago on a new bilateral air services 
agreement to replace the bermuda ii deal which was reached in the 
mid1970s 
the times said british airways britains largest airline is 
strongly opposed to the agreement calling it a sellout of 
british aviation to the americans 
british airways says the right to fly from british regional 
airports to the united states was useless because there was little 
demand for such service the times said 
british airways flies to new york boston philadelphia 
pittsburgh chicago detroit washington dc atlanta houston

gasoline for july delivery soared more than 26 cents a gallon 
tuesday on the new york mercantile exchange erasing steep losses 
registered during the three previous trading sessions 
market analysts said the rally reflected a bevy of minor 
influences including jitters about the crippled oil supertanker 
mega borg off the texas coast 
on other commodity markets grain and soybean futures were 
mixed livestock futures fell while pork bellies advanced and 
precious metals were mixed 
wholesale gasoline futures settled 13 cents to 262 cents 
higher with the contract for delivery in july up 262 cents at 585 
cents a gallon 
west texas intermediate crude oil futures finished 3 cents to 69 
cents higher with july at 1751 a barrel wholesale heating oil 
ended 60 cent to 166 cents higher with july at 4829 cents a 
gallon 
analysts viewed the rally partly as a technical correction after 
a threeday decline in which the july gasoline contract fell a 
total of 248 cents 
buying by wholesalers and distributors in the cash gasoline 
market also contributed to the runup as did concerns about the 
burning supertanker in the gulf of mexico 
it tends to conjure up images of last years exxon valdez 
incident which sparked a huge rally in the gasoline market said 
james ritterbusch an energy analyst for painewebber inc 
an announcement from royal dutchshell group that it no longer 
would use its own ships to send most petroleum products to the 
united states supported prices the britishdutch oil giant has 
been concerned about liability costs associated with environmental 
damage from recent tanker spills 
the rally also reflected speculation that tuesdays weekly 
american petroleum institute stocks report would show a drawdown in 
us supplies of gasoline ritterbusch said 
but the report which was released after the close of trading 
instead showed a 511000barrel increase in gasoline supplies along 
with a 126millionbarrel rise in crude oil stocks and a 
479000barrel increase in distillate stocks 
the crude oil number also ran counter to market expectations 
while the rise in distillate stocks was smaller than most traders 
had anticipated 
corn futures rose strongly on the chicago board of trade while 
other grain and soybean futures finished mixed ahead of a 
government report on agricultural supply and demand 
in the report which was released after the close the usda 
lowered its 1990 winter wheat producton forecast to 2089 billion 
bushels from last months projection of 2092 billion the number 
was slightly above market expections and still well above last 
years harvest of 1454 billion bushels 
the usda also projected further shrinkage of us soybean and 
corn stockpiles but said wheat stocks will rise 
wheat settled 1 cent lower to 2 cents higher with the contract 
for delivery in july at 335 a bushel corn futures were 2 cents 
to 4 cents higher with july at 292 a bushel oats were cent to 
1 cents lower with july at 146 a bushel soybeans were unchanged 
to 1 cent lower with july at 607 a bushel 
most livestock futures retreated on the chicago mercantile 
exchange erasing some of mondays gains 
but pork belly futures advanced for the fourth straight day 
ahead of a report that showed a 304millionpound drawdown last 
week in supplies of frozen bellies in warehouses outside of 
chicago the reduction was larger than expected 
live cattle futures settled 30 cent lower to 08 cent higher 
with june at 7620 cents a pound feeder cattle were 48 cent lower 
to 05 cent higher with august at 8497 cents a pound live hogs 
finished 40 cent lower to 10 cent higher with june at 6432 cents 
a pound frozen pork bellies were 02 cent to 75 cent higher with 
july at 7050 cents a pound 
on new yorks commodity exchange gold futures settled 60 cents 
to 70 cents lower with june at 35570 a troy ounce silver was 05 
cent to 08 cent higher with july at 504 a troy ounce

stocks and stockindex futures to exploit price disparities in the 
two markets they said buying programs kicked in automatically late 
in the day when futures prices substantially exceeded stock prices 
making stocks an attractive buy

a new york stock exchange panel tuesday proposed 
new severe trading halts to curb wild price swings but said widely 
criticized program trading strategies didnt cause market 
volatility 
the report capped a sixmonth study commissioned after the stock 
market plunged last october driving away many individual investors 
already shaken by the 1987 crash and provoking an outcry against 
program trading 
we need the small investor to feel he can go in and invest 
with confidence said general motors corp chairman roger smith 
chairman of the 19member market volatility and investor confidence 
panel 
the group proposed that the nyse install circuitbreakers to 
slow trading during wide market fluctuations the system would put 
a 400point cap on the possible daily rise or fall in the dow jones 
industrial average and the nations futures and options markets 
would coordinate trading halts 
but the panel found nothing inherently wrong with program 
trading the computerdriven strategy typically links the buying 
and selling of stock and stockindex futures and has been blamed 
for scaring away individual investors by feeding market plunges 
it suggested that program trading was a public relations problem 
for wall street and the perception that such strategies were unfair 
to individual investors or an abuse of the markets is largely 
unwarranted 
the panel was formed after the 190point plunge by the dow 
industrials last oct 13 which began with word that a takeover 
offer for the parent of united airlines had collapsed some experts 
have said that single event combined with speculative selling and 
program trading destabilized the market 
a type of program trading also has been blamed for worsening the 
black monday stock market crash of oct 19 1987 when the dow 
industrials fell 508 points since the crash the securities 
industry has been attempting to address questions about program 
trading in order to head off possibly restrictive moves by federal 
regulators or congress 
the nyse study concluded that market volatility and program 
trading are not the primary concern of individual investors who 
are more concerned about whether todays markets are operated 
fairly and honestly 
nonetheless it said the belief that program trading has 
diminished the fairness of markets reduces investor confidence 
among the nyse proposals 
a fourtier circuitbreaker coordinated among the us 
stock futures and options markets trading would stop for one hour 
when the dow jones average moves up or down 100 points from the 
previous days close 90 minutes when it moves 200 points and two 
hours each when it moves 300 points and 400 points 
the halts are longer than ones previously imposed by the big 
board they would require approval by the nyse chicago mercantile 
exchange and chicago board of trade 
revising federal securities laws to make it easier for 
corporations to buy back their own stock during market turmoil 
develop new products that would enable individual investors to 
protect themselves from extreme intraday price swings 
improve the exchanges ability to police intermarket trading 
abuses 
consolidating regulation of stocks and stockrelated futures 
under one federal agency to improve investor confidence similar 
legislation is being considered by congress 
the panel admitted that trading abuses exist in the financial 
markets but they do not appear to be embedded in the system in 
short the markets are not tilted against the individual investor 
or anyone else 
securities and exchange commission chairman richard s breeden 
said he was extremely pleased the panel endorsed creating a 
single regulatory agency for stocks and stockderived futures 
breeden said the report in essence fully confirms 
legislation backed by the bush administration that would give the 
sec authority over regulating stockindex futures 
in a dissent filed with the report chicago mercantile exchange 
chairman leo melamed a member of the panel opposed the 
singleregulator recommendation he said a majority of the panel 
simply mirrored a popular perception that consolidation of 
regulation seems desirable 
opponents of program trading criticized the report 
its simply an affirmaiton of the fact that the nyse has 
surrendered all of their hopes and dreams to the institutions 
said charles wohlstetter chairman of contel corp theyve 
accepted defeat without a fight 
in a survey of 560 people included in the report more than 50 
percent of respondents said they didnt pay much attention to the 
stock market or thought it was stable or pretty good 
more than half of the respondents said they hadnt heard of 
program trading but among people who own stock and were aware of 
the term 32 percent said program trading makes it hard for small 
investors to particpate in the stock market 
on a rating of concerns 58 percent of direct shareholders said 
their biggest concern was the honesty and ethics of stockbrokers 
compared to 18 percent for market volatility and 11 percent for 
program trading 
the big board defines program trading as any order for the 
simultaneous purchase or sale of 15 or more stocks index 
arbitrage a form of program trading involves rapid trading of 
stocks in new york and stockindex futures in chicago to profit 
from momentary price discrepancies 
empirical evidence suggests that index arbitrage is most 
likely the messenger through which new information gets 
incorporated into stock prices but it is not the primary cause of 
price changes the panel concluded 
without index arbitrage prices would still change albeit 
possibly more slowly with the arrival of new information it 
said 
nyse chairman john j phelan jr said the report would be voted 
on by the exchanges board and its recommendations discussed with 
other financial markets phelan said the he was confident the 
chicago futures markets would agree with most of the suggestions 
including the circuitbreakers 
the panel included officials from wall street major 
corporations state government and higher education

in another network attack on the current 
people meter ratings system nbc on tuesday announced its own 
plan for giving sponsors free ad time when its television shows get 
lowerthanpromised ratings 
nbc announcement made less than two weeks after a similar 
announcement by abc comes at a time the three networks are sharply 
disputing lower ratings reported by the vieweractivated 
peoplemeter ratings system of ac nielsen co 
although nielsen officials say last seasons reported drop in 
network viewing is real the networks argue that the nielsen data 
is wrong 
this has led nbc and abc to use different statistical formulas 
aimed at cushioning each network from financial losses caused by 
the data from peoplemeters which monitor viewing habits in 4000 
homes 
nbc officials have estimated their network could lose as much as 
100 million next season because of the lower ratings 
cbs expects to announce its own plan on wednesday said cbs 
research vice president david poltrack 
the planned changes could leave advertisers and their 
representatives facing three completely different network formulas 
for dealing with socalled makegood agreements with 
advertisers 
poltrack said he expected the strategy of advertising agencies 
then would be to voice a preference for one plan over the others 
and hope that that would bring the networks in conformance with one 
plan 
i think this will be resolved fairly quickly but i may be 
wrong he added 
the network announcements come at the onset of the socalled 
upfront buying period by advertisers for next season a period 
that can be worth 4 billion of the estimated 10 billion in total 
network sales for next season 
the matter has gotten a lot of publicity but its not that 
complicated said john sisk senior vice president for network 
negotiations at the j walter thompson advertising agency 
we negotiate a lot of things with them the networksthis 
will be part of the negotiations sisk said referring to the 
beginning upfront purchase of commercial time for the 199091 
season 
its a major part of the negotiations but only a part 
sisk said he hadnt yet seen the details of nbcs plan which 
bases its formula for makegoods on television audience data going 
back to 1982 
abcs plan uses a threeyear average starting in 1987 when 
nielsens peoplemeter system became the industrys national 
standard 
the system requires individual viewers in participating homes to 
log on to nielsen devices when watching a tv set the previous 
passive system simply recorded what was being watched but not who 
was watching 
richard kurlander whose company buys commercial time for 110 tv 
stations declined to comment on nbcs announcement until the 
network had provided him with its details 
obviously theres some unhappiness but itll get all sorted 
out said kurlander vice president of programming at petry 
television i think we should wait until we actually sift through 
it 
nbcs initial announcement was made in a corporate press release 
that among other things spoke of the use of a standard linear 
regression model in projecting television viewing levels for next 
season
