james david watkins the former naval commander 
reportedly chosen by george bush to head the energy department is 
an authority on nuclear warfare who will put that expertise to work 
trying to clean up the nations crumbling atomic weapons plants 
watkins whom cbs said has been picked to be energy secretary 
will take over an agency charged with overseeing the 
multibilliondollar renovation of the nations aging and 
increasingly unsafe complex of plants that build nuclear warheads 
watkins ended his 41year navy career in 1986 after a fouryear 
stint as the chief of naval operations the services top officer 
but within a year the former nuclear submarine commander had 
stepped into a new hot seat 
in october 1987 president reagan picked watkins to head the 
presidential commission that was supposed to tell reagan what the 
nation should do about aids 
watkins used to command jumped in with authority guided the 
panel through exhaustive hearings and led it to a series of widely 
praised recommendations 
watkins was born march 7 1927 in alhambra calif near the los 
angeles harbor his mother was louis ward watkins who ran 
unsuccessfully in 1938 for the republican nomination to californias 
senate seat one of the few women at the time who sought national 
office 
he later recalled that his mother used to take him and his 
brother down to nearby navy ports to watch the big ships come and 
go she sometimes arranged to get the three of them aboard the 
ships where they dined with officers and heard tales about life on 
the high seas 
it was those stories and the ships that helped convince 
watkins he wanted a life in the navy he entered the naval academy 
in 1945 just as world war ii was winding down 
following his graduation four years later watkins served aboard 
destroyers and submarines earned a masters degree at the naval 
postgraduate school and then made a decision that helped steer the 
course of his career 
watkins went into nuclear submarines where he came under the 
aegis of adm hyman rickover the father of the modern nuclear navy 
and the man who played a key role in the careers of dozens of navy 
leaders in the postworld war ii era 
after completing the nuclear reactor engineering course at the 
oak ridge tenn national laboratory watkins took command of the 
nuclearpowered attack sub snook 
watkins steered the snook into the harbor at yokosuka japan the 
first visit of a nuclearpowered ship to the only nation which has 
been the target of nuclear attack more than 5000 demonstrators 
greeted the ship 
watkins rose within the navys ranks and became commander of the 
pacific fleet based in honolulu he was in that post in march 1982 
when reagan picked him as chief of naval operations 
in that post watkins helped oversee the big naval buildup from 
450 to nearly 600 ships that was at the heart of reagans defense 
budget during the presidents first term

shining path rebels killed 11 policemen in a 
cocaineproducing jungle valley and lima police arrested 200 
students in a protest instigated by the maoist guerrilla group 
authorities said 
the two weekend ambushes by the shining path in the huallaga 
valley where about 60 percent of the worlds coca crop is grown 
also wounded 11 people the government paper la cronica reported 
tuesday 
the deaths brought the insurgency toll since saturday to 28 
killed 
in lima dozens of heavily armed riot police swept onto the san 
marcos university campus on tuesday police said arresting 200 
students who were blocking nearby streets with rocks and bonfires 
and exploding dynamite charges 
police reported no injuries in the protest one of dozens at san 
marcos over the past year 
witnesses said the disturbance was sparked by recent austerity 
measures but officials said shining path supporters were behind the 
campus violence 
the weekend deaths come amid a recent spurt of violence in the 
shining path insurgency which has claimed 12000 victims since 
fighting began in 1980 la cronica said separate guerrillas columns 
hiding in the dense jungle opened fire on passing patrol vehicles 
with automatic weapons and hand grenades 
seven policemen were slain on a jungle road 20 miles northwest of 
tingo maria 240 miles northeast of lima and four policemen died in 
an ambush near polvora 100 miles north of tingo maria la cronica 
said 
there were no reports of rebel casualties or word on whether 
police were able to return the gunfire 
officials said the region has become a nomans land overrun by 
drug traffickers and maoist guerrillas who provide the traffickers 
protection in exchange for funds to buy weapons 
peruvian coca is usually processed into a semirefined state and 
smuggled into colombia where it is turned into pure cocaine for 
sale in us and european markets according to the us drug 
enforcement administration 
the huallaga valley ayacucho and apurimac are among eight states 
currently under states of emergency giving the military broad 
policing and governing powers to counter the rebels

the reagan administrations parting shot on the 
savings and loan crisis a recommendation to curtail deposit 
insurance landed with a thud on capitol hill and at the 
presidents own treasury department 
secretary of the treasury nicholas f brady who will remain in 
the administration of presidentelect bush moved swiftly to disavow 
the proposal which came tuesday in a report to congress by the 
white house council of economic advisers 
brady is formulating the next administrations plan for the sampl 
industry in which a postdepression record of 205 institutions were 
closed last year 
until now hes refused to release any details of the work in 
progress but the white house suggestion prompted him to make a rare 
disclosure in a statement released through rep chalmers wylie of 
ohio the ranking republican on the committee brady denied 
emphatically the administration is even considering reducing the 
100000 limit on insured accounts 
news of the reagan report reached the house banking committee on 
tuesday in the middle of a sixhour hearing on the sampl problem and 
provoked an outcry 
i think its wrong to even discuss limiting the insurance 
said rep kweisi mfume dmd 
the reagan report did not suggest how much the insurance limit 
should be reduced nor did it say if the reduction should apply to 
existing deposits or just to new deposits 
most depositors would be unaffected even by a sharp reduction 
according to the us league of savings institutions a trade group 
the average sampl account at the end of 1987 had 8440 
nevertheless congress is extraordinarily sensitive about 
anything that might spook depositors into withdrawing their money 
all that really keeps insolvent sampls afloat is congress word that 
it will stand behind the deposits 
im appalled at the timing of the administration i think 
the public needs some reassurance said rep charles schumer 
dny 
the federal savings and loan insurance corp which itself has 
been technically insolvent since 1986 simply does not have the cash 
to pay off depositors in failed institutions instead it has been 
wiping out failed sampls losses by issuing promissory notes pledging 
income the fund expects to receive in the future 
congress is looking at ways to pump more money into the insurance 
fund and most private analysts believe it will have to turn to the 
taxpayer 
the council of economic advisers acknowledged that deposit 
insurance provided by the government ever since the wave of bank 
failures in the 1930s discourages bank runs and provides poor and 
middleclass people with a safe place for their money 
but it also dramatically reduces the incentives for depositors 
to monitor the financial health of their bank the report said 
because insured depositors dont care how well their institution is 
run bank officers have less incentive to manage wisely it argued 
lowering the insurance limit would restore muchneeded 
discipline to the system it said 
regulators are leery of reducing the limit because a run by a few 
bigmoney depositors is just as damaging if not more damaging than 
a run of many small depositors 
they fear that if a run causes a bank or sampl failure 
particularly at a big bank holding deposits for smaller 
institutions it could trigger a chain reaction possibly causing a 
general financial collapse 
but many industry officials maintain that a lower insurance limit 
would have little effect good or bad currently depositors with 
millions of dollars who want it all insured use a broker a 
computer splits the money into chunks of less than 100000 and 
parcels it out to as many institutions as necessary a computer 
could just as easily split the money into 50000 pieces or even 
10000 pieces 
the real impact would simply be to inconvenience people said 
mark clark an executive vice president with the us league 
a suggestion sometimes offered as a way to plug that loophole is 
limiting depositors to only one insured account but federal home 
loan bank board chairman m danny wall said the rule would be 
extremely difficult to enforce 
the internal revenue service which keeps track of deposit 
accounts to make sure tax is being paid on interest earned hasnt 
been able to obtain social security numbers necessary to monitor all 
of the accounts despite an intensive effort wall said

george bushs cabinet is emerging as nearly all 
male all republican establishment but women and conservatives are 
holding their fire 
bushs honeymoon period is quite a contrast to eight years ago 
when conservatives voiced outrage over several of ronald reagans 
cabinet choices 
the reagan transition was marked by regular denunciations by 
conservatives of such cabinet choices as donald t regan for 
treasury secretary and malcolm baldrige for commerce secretary 
no such outcry has greeted the bush cabinet although most of the 
choices are no more acceptable to conservatives the only bush 
cabinet appointee to rank as a conservative hero is former rep jack 
kemp the choice to head the department of housing and urban 
development 
craig shirley a conservative consultant who backed bush for the 
gop presidential nomination said there is a mixed response to the 
emerging administration 
some are very delighted because bush struck conservative themes 
during the campaign and he hasnt changed on any of those he 
said others are taking more of a waitandsee attitude and then 
there are the historical bushbashers 
one of the longtime bush bashers is richard viguerie a 
conservative fundraiser who was an early and outspoken critic of 
reagan cabinet choices 
the consensus among conservatives is this is not the time 
lets wait said viguerie there is nothing to be gained by 
going out there and pounding the table now 
viguerie was less restrained than many of his conservative allies 
and he described the bush appointments as very disillusioning 
discouraging and disappointing 
throughout his campaign and since winning the presidency bush 
has emphasized his desire to reach out and bring into government 
people who are too often overlooked 
if by that he meant women so far he has fallen short 
i keep being told give it time said nancy thompson a 
republican consultant who was a bush delegate to the 1988 republican 
national convention 
ive got my fingers crossed 
thompson and susan mclane a republican state senator in new 
hampshire chose to praise the women bush has chosen rather than 
bemoan those left out 
both cited the selection of elizabeth dole to head the labor 
department and carla hills to be trade representative as encouraging 
choices 
but mclane conceded that women appear still to be at a stage 
where they must be satisfied with one or two highvisibility jobs in 
an administration 
i think we are still at that age she said 
as for the presidentelects attitude toward appointing women 
she said i dont think george bush has thought about it that much 
and he hasnt thought about it as something important 
there are only a very few of those top top spots said 
thompson and to have two one and a half if you will hills 
would have cabinet status but not run a full department that are 
that visible thats good 
thompson said she expected to see far more women in the next 
round of appointments 
im waiting for this second cut i believe thats where were 
going to find some names 
rep lynn martin of illinois a strong bush supporter from the 
earliest stages of the presidential campaign was on many lists of 
potential cabinet appointees 
my name was being thrown around a lot not necessarily to my 
benefit she said the fact is he never asked me to serve in his 
cabinet and i dont know if i would have or could have i think 
there was an assumption i was talking to him every day and it just 
wasnt so 
martin who denied any personal disappointment said i know he 
has asked again and again for the group around him to give him the 
names of more women of more hispanics or more blacks 
i believe were going to see a lot of women she added and 
if we dont the shoe drops

the man who would be education president says 
hell push certain public school reforms and provide whatever aid he 
can in tough budgetary times to districts trying to improve 
their schools 
i do want to help presidentelect bush told educators 
tuesday at a white house workshop on experiments that give parents 
wide freedom to select their childrens public schools 
i do intend to provide every feasible assistance to states to 
districts interested in further experimentation with choice plans 
and other valuable reforms bush said i will ask the department 
of education to monitor and focus continued attention on the need 
for future progress and ill be a spokesman and advocate for 
further public school improvements 
bush said he is particularly enthusiastic about having parents 
and students being able to choose their public schools calling the 
prevailing system of assigned schools a trap and their students 
captive clients 
its a system that can perpetuate mediocrity he said poor 
schools have no incentives to improve 
supporters of choosing schools say it makes schools more 
competitive and responsive improves morale and attendance reduces 
disciplinary problems and dropouts and improves learning among 
students 
president reagan addressing the workshop earlier in the day 
cited the examples of a harlem school district in which scores 
have risen dramatically because parents are now permitted to choose 
which school to send their children to and a minnesota program 
that is fostering unprecedented competition among public schools 
to make them more attractive to parents and students 
referring to the supreme courts brown v board of education in 
1954 that integrated public schools bush said it is now time to 
focus on what goes on inside those doors 
quality education has become a central civil rights question of 
our time he said and too often today it is our disadvantaged 
children who are most likely to be burdened by inadequate public 
education 
bush said that for choice to work teachers and principals need 
greater autonomy and authority while parents need better 
publicized more reliable performance evaluations of schools 
the heads of the nations two teacher unions both attended the 
workshop and said they were encouraged by the emphasis on 
strengthening public schools as opposed to giving needy parents 
public money to send their kids to private schools a recurring 
reagan administration theme 
i didnt hear anything about vouchers or tuition tax credits 
and those would be the red flags for us said mary futrell 
president of the national education association 
to the extent you increase public school choice you decrease 
pressure for vouchers and tuition tax credits added albert 
shanker president of the american federation of teachers

in a round of layoffs dubbed the tuesday 
massacre by a justice department spokesman more than 20 
department employees including some career public affairs officers 
were fired in an effort to save money 
i dont think they gave any thought to how the work would get 
done laidoff spokesman thomas stewart said tuesday its such 
a clownish performance to take all the press officers out of the 
press office and tell the director to run it with whats left 
the public affairs office currently served by 10 spokesmen who 
handle hundreds of phone calls from reporters each day will be left 
with four after the layoffs take effect feb 10 of those four 
three will be political appointees 
ten people from the office of legislative affairs also are losing 
their jobs said thomas boyd assistant attorney general in charge 
of that office 
the 21 people being laid off receive annual salaries and benefits 
totaling 955983 said deborah burstionwade deputy director of 
public affairs of that the public affairs employees represent 
613392 and the legislative affairs workers represent 342501 
burstionwade who will keep her job denied that the layoffs 
were politically motivated and added anytime you have a budget 
crunch you have to make some tough decisions 
loye miller public affairs director said he was surprised by 
the layoffs when thornburghs staff informed him tuesday morning 
even though he knew the office of management and budget was planning 
cutbacks 
miller and boyd said their offices had been overstaffed and 
underfunded according to budget authorization levels as a result 
money had been transferred from other areas to pay for them

a vast majority of americans support programs 
to help the chronically poor according to a survey released today 
by a civil rights group 
the naacp legal defense and education fund also said it found 
further erosion in opposition to busing to achieve school 
integration 
the survey demonstrates that the public is primed for 
presidential action and leadership on race relations issues said 
elaine jones deputy directorcounsel of the fund 
the survey found that 93 percent of whites and 95 percent of 
blacks favored special school programs beginning at age 8 to 
motivate poor youngsters to stay in school and not drop out 
ninety percent of whites and 95 percent of blacks favored federal 
youth corps camps where poor young people could learn to read and 
write and attain other skills similar majorities supported business 
incentives to provide jobs in poor neighborhoods 
among blacks 79 percent said the best longterm way to combat 
crime was not to spend large sums of money sending criminals to 
prison and keeping them there a long time but to spend the same 
money attacking the causes of crime such as reducing poverty 
keeping young people in school and motivating young people to 
succeed rather than become criminals among whites 81 percent 
agreed 
the civil rights group said the poll was taken june 3 through 
sept 12 by louis harris and associates and based on interviews with 
more than 3000 people the report was unclear as to the margin of 
error 
according to the survey 57 percent of whites remained opposed to 
busing children to achieve school integration but 67 percent of 
blacks remained in favor of it among all americans it was favored 
by 54 percent 
until two years ago opposition among all americans had remained 
a consistent 78 percent for three decades 
the survey was accompanied by a separate study documenting 
conditions among the black poor eightysix percent of single 
mothers surveyed received no funds from their families or the 
government to pay for child care just 11 percent said they received 
federal or state housing subsidies 
sixteen percent reported having private health insurance 
compared with 60 percent among all americans 
the naacp legal defense and educational fund inc is a separate 
and distinct organization from the national association for the 
advancement of colored people founded in 1940s the new yorkbased 
group has played a major role in many of the battles or the civil 
rights era

women and minorities who worked for a major 
chicago bank from 1973 to 1988 will share a record 14 million in 
back pay the bank agreed to pay in settling a race and sex bias case 
dating to 1977 
harris trust and savings bank and the labor department announced 
the settlement tuesday ending an 11year legal battle in which an 
administrative law judge twice ruled against the institution a 
chicago group that intervened on behalf of some bank workers 
estimated that about 5000 current and former harris employees are 
eligible for a share of the settlement 
harris said it would put the money in an escrow account in 
another bank the government is responsible for finding the workers 
and determining how much back pay to award them 
the bank said it was not admitting to any wrongdoing but was 
settling the case to avoid more legal and statistical wrangling 
under the agreement harris trust must revise its affirmative 
action policies set up training programs for women and minorities 
seeking promotions to professional and managerial posts and tell 
the department periodically over the next three years how well it is 
complying with the agreement and antidiscrimination laws 
the agreement did not set any quotas or goals for the bank to 
meet 
the labor department in 1977 charged that harris trust was 
discriminating by promoting white men at a higher rate than women 
and minorities with comparable skills and was paying the white men 
more for comparable work 
four years later a labor department administrative law judge 
ruled that harris trust had discriminated against women and 
minorities in a number of areas the judge awarded 122 million in 
back pay 
but thenlabor secretary raymond donovan set aside the decision 
saying the bank wrongly had been denied an opportunity to present 
statistical studies in its defense 
the case was reheard and in 1986 the judge again ruled the bank 
was liable for back pay to women and minority employees on its 
payroll from 1974 to dec 22 1986 unless it could prove it ceased 
the discriminatory practices before that date 
the settlement announced tuesday expanded that period to cover 
women and minorities in the banks employ at any time from may 1973 
to december 1988 
the labor departments solicitor george r salem said the 
settlement represents a major step forward not only for the 
present and former employees of the harris bank who will benefit 
from it but also for all women and minority group workers in the 
american labor force 
but b kenneth west chairman and chief executive officer of 
harris trust said that ending the matter was a pure business 
decision made not because we believe we are guilty but because 
the administrative process for a defendant is lengthy 
timeconsuming costly and frustrating 
the time has come to put this matter behind us he said 
harris trust with assets of 117 billion reported employing 
3967 workers as of dec 28 1988 of them 598 percent were women 
and 337 percent minorities with some overlap 
west in the banks statement said harris trust expected to 
report within weeks record earnings for 1988 and would charge the 
majority of the settlement expenses to its 1988 operations he 
was not more specific 
salem said 14 million was the largest back pay award ever 
obtained by the department in a case involving alleged sex or race 
discrimination the previous record was 10 million he said

the longrange program that lets farmers take 
fragile land out of crop production is turning into the agriculture 
departments main showcase for soil and water conservation programs 
moreover because the conservation reserve program or crp has 
had strong bipartisan support in congress there is a reasonably 
good chance that the programs spending blueprint offered by 
president reagan may fare well when the bush administration takes 
over 
the crp was authorized by congress in the 1985 farm law and had 
the support of many environmental conservation and agricultural 
groups 
under the plan farmers can contract with usda to take highly 
erodible land from crop production for 10 years in return they get 
initial federal assistance in establishing protective soil cover of 
grass or trees and then receive annual rental payments for the term 
of the contract 
the goal of congress was to get 40 million to 45 million acres in 
crp by the end of 1990 seven signups have been held so far the 
most recent in july and august and an eighth is scheduled for feb 
624 
thus far crp has about 282 million acres enrolled 
according to president reagans final budget sent to congress 
this week the crp is firmly entrenched as the usdas premier and 
most costly conservation program 
overall the departments soil and water programs are expected to 
operate at the level of almost 27 billion in the fiscal year that 
will begin oct 1 about the same as this year 
that includes 632 million for soil conservation service 
technical assistance and other programs and more than 2 bilion for 
the crp which is handled by the agricultural stabilization and 
conservation service 
a usda budget report said erosion has been reduced by more than 
90 percent on land already enrolled in the longterm program 
over 17 million acres of trees have been planted the report 
said and if the current trends continue the crp will likely 
become the largest publicly sponsored treeplanting program in the 
nations history 
stephen b dewhurst the departments budget director said the 
reagan budget plan provides enough funding to go to the 40 million 
acre level of land idling in the coming fiscal year and that 
there is enough money in this budget to keep the crp on track 
although crp is the biggest gun in the departments conservation 
arsenal there are other important programs that concern the 
nations soil and water resources 
for example the reagan budget would continue soil conservation 
service or scs soil surveys at the level of 687 million in 1990 
and snow surveys at 55 million the snow surveys are important for 
gauging how much water will be available from snowmelt in the west 
watershed planning and construction is another major item at 
1039 million although that would be down from 181 million 
currently

the agriculture department says private 
exporters have sold an additional 360000 metric tons of us wheat 
to china at subsidized prices 
melvin e sims general sales manager for the departments 
foreign agricultural service said tuesday the wheat was part of 1 
million tons authorized dec 30 for china under the export 
enhancement program or eep 
under the eep arrangement exporters can sell wheat and other 
designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in 
order to meet foreign competition exporters then collect free 
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses or 
subsidies 
the wheat sales were handled by five companies continental grain 
co 40000 tons entrade international ltd 30000 central states 
enterprises inc 50000 ferruzzii usa inc 100000 and louis 
dreyfus corp 140000 
sims said the wheat was sold for march shipment and will carry an 
average subsidy rate of 2279 per ton or about 62 cents per bushel 
counting some wheat left over from previous eep arrangements 
china has 210000 tons still available under the program 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat the 360000 tons of wheat would be about 132 million 
bushels 
wheat prices at the farm have been averaging around 409 per 
bushel according to recent usda market figures making the new sale 
worth an estimated 54 million

the agriculture department has expanded the 
longrange conservation reserve program so that certain farmed 
wetlands and other highly erodible land subject to damage from 
occasional flooding can be signed up 
milton hertz executive vice president of the departments 
commodity credit corp said tuesday the lands will be eligible for 
crp only if farmed in two of the five crop years 1981 through 1985 
to be eligible the land must be scoured by erosion caused by 
outofbank water flows which can be expected to flood at least once 
every 10 years he said 
the deparments soil conservation service estimates there were 
more than four million acres of wetlands used for crops in 1982 
most of the land is in the north central states or in the flood 
plains of the mississippi and other major rivers 
land put into the program must be planted to trees or other 
approved vegetative cover in return farmers can collect federal 
assistance to establish the protective cover and get annual rental 
payments for 10 years 
the next signup for crp will be feb 624 more than 28 million 
acres have been enrolled so far the goal is to have at least 40 
million acres of highly erodible land in the program by the end of 
1990

a modern soviet composer will help carnegie hall 
celebrate its centennial as a reminder that a compatriot peter 
ilich tchaikovsky was at the hall when it opened 
carnegie halls centennial will be celebrated during the entire 
199091 season and will be highlighted by a series of world 
premieres carnegie president isaac stern said tuesday 
carnegie hall made its debut on may 5 1891 with a concert by 
the new york philharmonic and two conductors walter damrosch and 
tchaikovsky tchaikovsky conducted two of his works 
soviet composer alfred schnittke will write a work for the 
cleveland orchestra as part of the centennial said carnegie general 
manager judith arron 
since tchaikovsky came and opened the hall it is fitting that 
one of the most celebrated of russian composers today could write a 
new piece for us she said 
tchaikovsky memorabilia and manuscripts on loan from the soviet 
union will be the first exhibit in a carnegie hall museum adjacent 
to the hall 
under a 500000 centennial commissioning project 10 or more 
compositions will be premiered during the centennial season mrs 
arron said 
all the pieces will be making their debuts in carnegie except for 
sir michael tippetts setting of poems by william butler yeats for 
soprano jessye norman and the chicago symphony 
the composition is a joint commission with the chicago orchestra 
which is celebrating its 100th anniversary the same season mrs 
arron said 
the first performance will be in chicago but sir georg soltis 
final performance with the orchestra as its music director will be 
at carnegie she said

conductor mstislav rostropovich credits recent 
soviet moves toward artistic freedom for his plan to present the 
world premiere of a longsuppressed musical satire written by the 
late composer dmitri shostakovich to ridicule the stalinist regime 
the unpublished 15minute theatrical piece entitled rayok 
russian for little eden will be performed for the first time 
thursday night in the kennedy center concert hall with rostropovich 
at the piano leading a cast of four bass singers and a small mixed 
chorus 
three additional performances will be given at the kennedy center 
through tuesday and shostakovichs son maxim a conductor who 
defected to the united states in 1981 was expected to be in the 
audience for a sunday afternoon performance in new yorks carnegie 
hall 
rostropovich the sovietborn music director of the national 
symphony orchestra apparently acquired a copy of the score and 
libretto for rayok only recently at a news conference tuesday 
he refused to say how or exactly when it fell into his hands 
there are a lot of counterfeits around he said but im 
willing to put my life on the line that this is shostakovichs 
music 
he said shostakovich secretly wrote rayok in 1960 to express 
his contempt for soviet dictator josef stalin who had died seven 
years earlier and two senior kremlin bureaucrats who had led a 
harsh ideological crackdown on soviet composers writers and artists 
in the late 1940s 
rostropovich a close friend of shostakovich for more than 20 
years said that until recently it would have meant imprisonment or 
the death penalty to perform rayok in the soviet union but 
under soviet president mikhail s gorbachev he said now you can 
do this even in the soviet union 
rostropovich said he knows of no plans for a soviet performance 
of the work although he said the late composers family is 
negotiating to have it published 
he said he has no fears his performances of the longhidden piece 
might jeopardize the safety of the shostakovich family as it might 
have in the recent past if i thought this would make it difficult 
for the family i wouldnt do it he said 
rostropovich said the ability to present rayok without fear 
of repercussions is another sign that now the soviet union has 
truly changed and this is a happy time he said gorbachevs 
repudiation of the excesses of the stalin era vindicates 
shostakovichs criticism 
finally the arts are being turned over to people who understand 
them rostropovich said no one in the politburo is being a 
musical teacher to artists 
the shostakovich work is a scathing putdown of stalin and of 
dmitri t shepilov and andrei a zhdanov the highlevel officials 
of the soviet communist party who led the cultural purge that began 
in 1947 
according to rostropovich the musical satire is based on 
speeches given at a special meeting of the partys central committee 
in 1948 where prominent soviet composers including shostakovich 
and sergei prokofiev were denounced for formalistic tendencies 
and directed to write music of realism for the masses 
shostakovich privately held the musical bureaucrats in contempt 
as crude and ignorant he publicly confessed he was guilty of their 
charges and was kicked out of the moscow conservatory 
rostropovich himself fled his homeland in 1974 the year before 
shostakovich died in moscow and was stripped of his soviet 
citizenship in 1978 the same year he was hired by the national 
symphony 
although heartened by gorbachevs reform policies rostropovich 
said he remains an official nonperson in the soviet union and has 
no plans to return

the commission trying to find a way to 
eliminate the huge federal budget deficit has the goahead from 
presidentelect bush to start putting its proposals in writing 
bush sent word to the national economic commission that he would 
like to have the groups recommendations in hand by march 1 
bushs decision was being hailed by commission members as a sign 
that the presidentelect planned to use the 14member panels work 
in his own budget negotiations with congress 
the commission which includes such leaders as chrysler chairman 
lee iacocca and aflcio chairman lane kirkland was created by 
congress with the hope that it could come up with a 
deficitreduction package acceptable to the new administration and 
congress 
commission cochairman drew lewis said the panel would be able to 
meet the deadline and many panelists expressed pleasure that bush 
had decided not to postpone the commissions report until sept 1 
which he had the option of doing 
some had feared that bush who was critical of the panel during 
the presidential election might decide to delay the report in an 
effort to play down any recommendations from the panel 
lewis said he was told of the reporting decision on tuesday by 
treasury secretary nicholas brady who will retain that position in 
the bush administration 
lewis said brady told him to prepare recommendations over the 
next seven weeks unless he hears otherwise from bush once he takes 
office on jan 20 
the commission met tuesday to review the outlook for the economy 
the assumptions the panel decides to use for such things as economic 
growth inflation unemployment and interest rates will have a big 
effect on how much in deficit reductions it will need to recommend 
to eliminate the budget deficit in coming years 
bush said during the presidential campaign that the commission 
was little more than a stalking horse for tax increases which bush 
has vowed to oppose 
since winning election however bush has insisted he is serious 
about reducing the federal deficit partly to calm fears of foreign 
investors and prevent a run on the value of the dollar in foreign 
currency markets 
the advisory panel which is headed by lewis a republican and 
by democrat robert strauss has scheduled a string of hearings this 
month and next to craft a plan originally those hearings were to 
be held in secret but a group of news organizations won a court 
battle last week that forced the sessions to be opened to the public 
lewis former transportation secretary in the reagan 
administration and now chairman of union pacific said tuesday it 
was possible that the commission might be forced to issue a majority 
and a minority report because differences among panel members could 
prove too wide to bridge 
he said there was also a possibility that even after the 
commission issues its report it may be called back into session by 
the administration if a deadlock develops with congress over the 
budget 
if the presidentelect and congress cant solve this problem 
then we probably would be brought back into action lewis said 
the meeting tuesday was the first one attended by bushs two 
appointees to the panel former sen paul laxalt rnev and former 
rep thomas ashley dohio

the chances of all of an airliners engines 
going out may be 10 million to one but with millions of flights 
each year it still happens 
at least four usbuilt jetliners in addition to the boeing 737 
that crashed sunday in england killing 44 people have experienced 
the loss of all their engines in flight according to government 
records 
last may an el salvadoran taca airlines 737 lost both engines 
while descending in a thunderstorm near new orleans but managed to 
land safely on a levee 
in august 1987 another 737 belonging to a european regional 
airline lost power in a snowstorm over greece but pilots restarted 
the engines 
in may 1983 an eastern airlines lockheed l1011 en route from 
miami to the bahamas lost all three of its engines but pilots 
managed to restart one and land safely back in miami investigators 
concluded that maintenance workers neglected to check that critical 
oil seals were in place 
in april 1977 a southern airways dc9 lost power in its two 
engines in a hailstorm and crashlanded in new hope ga killing 62 
people and injuring 23 others 
the four incidents occurred over a period when us airliners 
were logging between 6 million and 7 million flights a year a 
british investigator said there was a one in 10 million chance of 
both of a twoengine airliners engines failing on the same flight 
the two incidents involving 737s powered by cfm56 engines like 
those on the british flight led the federal aviation administration 
to issue air worthiness directives ordering pilots to take special 
procedures during landings in stormy weather 
faa spokesman fred farrar said the directives would not have 
applied to the british flight however because it was in clear 
weather and at a high altitude when the first engine failed 
although some officials at the scene in england initially said 
pilot error was not to blame investigators said tuesday they were 
looking into the possibility that the pilot erroneously shut down 
his remaining good engine instead of the one that caught fire in the 
air 
national transportation safety board records show 92 double 
engine failures in us airplanes since 1962 but the vast majority 
were in small planes that ran out of gas 
when both engines on a plane go out investigators normally would 
look at the performance of the pilot particularly actions taken 
after one engine fails along with the engines themselves the fuel 
and electrical systems and the possibility of sabotage or 
maintenance failure among other possible causes 
planes with the cfm56 engines such as those used on the 737 have 
been involved in 13 air accidents or incidents including four that 
were attributed to engine trouble according to safety board records 
two days before the british midland crash a federal judge in 
cincinnati ordered the unsealing of a fourmonthold lawsuit that 
alleges that components in engines including the cfm56s used in the 
new boeing 737 that crashed in england were inadequately tested at a 
general electric plant in seattle wash and that the company 
falsified test reports on military engines 
ge has denied inadequate testing of any cfm56s and faa spokesman 
farrar said a timer assembly for the engines involved in the suit 
could not have caused the british crash he said its failure would 
only cause a small increase in engine temperature but not fire 
farrar said no government investigation of engine testing is 
planned before investigators determine the cause of the crash 
any engine has to meet very rigid requirements as to 
performance and construction said farrar there is no reason to 
believe the ge engines had any fatal flaw 
the engines were thoroughly tested in france at the ge plant in 
the united states and again after they were installed in the plane 
in seattle said general electric spokesman william shumann he said 
about 1000 of the engines are in use 
but james helmer lawyer for former ge seattle plant manager 
anthony divincenzo who filed the suit said the timer part and 
possibly other gebuilt components of the cfm56 were inadequately 
tested he said divincenzo secretly filed his suit after he exposed 
inadequate testing to ge officials and was demoted and reassigned to 
a plant in cincinnati 
the government should have been investigating this engine six 
months ago not after 44 people are killed helmer said in a 
telephone interview 
helmer said a team of whistleblower lawyers would conduct an 
investigation of engine manufacturing including visits to the ge 
plant in seattle an examination of documents on engine tests and 
depositions from plant workers and officials 
the cfm56 engines on the british plane were manufactured in 
france with both us and french components under an agreement 
between ge and the french company snecma the cfm56s used on 737s 
have been in service for about five years

united press international says it lost 16 
million in 1988 and it is laying off about 40 employees 
president paul steinle said tuesday that the 1988 loss was down 
substantially from a 25 million shortfall in 1987 and that he 
expects the 81yearold news agency to begin turning a profit by the 
end of this year 
steinle said about onethird of upis losses in 1988 resulted 
from onetime costs involving the olympics political conventions 
elections and staff severance payments 
the upi president said in a statement that some 40 positions were 
being eliminated worldwide although the statement did not give a 
breakdown upi staffers speaking on condition of anonymity said 20 
of the jobs were in foreign bureaus and 20 were in domestic bureaus 
including 10 in washington where upi has its world headquarters 
steinle said no upi services were being eliminated and that he 
expected that about 40 persons would be hired as regional business 
reporters sometime in 1989 restoring overall staffing to its 
previous level 
upi said it was combining two managing editor positions into one 
with bill ferguson former managing editor for national news 
becoming managing editor of upi news 
leon daniel who had been managing editor for international news 
since 1987 will return to reporting upi said

surgeon general c everett koop describes 
himself as an opponent of abortion but hes finding friends where 
he previously had few in the wake of his decision not to issue a 
report on health effects of abortion 
the prochoice national abortion rights action league praised 
koop on tuesday for having too much integrity to issue a biased 
report 
the antiabortion march for life group however said the surgeon 
general was highly misguided 
neither group though agreed with koops recommendation that a 
definitive study costing 10 million to 100 million be conducted to 
decide conclusively whether women suffer mental or physical effects 
from abortion 
nancy broff of naral said the money could be better used for 
contraception research while nellie gray of march for life said 
we dont need any more studies what we need is for koop to 
retire 
however one antiabortion group national right to life said a 
study like the one koop is proposing is long overdue olivia 
gans a spokeswoman for the group claimed that psychological harm 
from abortion often surfaces five to 10 years later while existing 
research generally is based on studies of women in their first year 
after abortion 
koop said he refused to issue a report requested by president 
reagan because existing data simply do not support the premise 
that abortion does or does not cause a specific postabortion 
psychiatric syndrome 
in a letter to reagan earlier this week koop said that among the 
presidents advisers it was a foregone conclusion that the 
negative health effects of abortion on women were so overwhelming 
that the evidence would force the reversal of roe versus wade the 
landmark supreme court decision that legalized abortion 
but koop said no such scientific evidence exists he said that 
while anecdotal reports are plentiful to support both sides 
individual cases cannot be used to reach scientifically sound 
conclusions 
reagan administration officials would not comment on koops 
decision presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan 
doesnt have any characterization one way or the other of the 
surgeon generals letter

heres how nbc analyst gerald jaffe watches 
football 
im sitting there watching the game and when that fourth 
quarter started im thinking were looking at a 725 pm 
finish and there goes the week for us 
but the san francisco 49ers wrapped up a 283 victory over the 
chicago bears in the nfc championship jaffe was relieved not 
because hes a 49ers fan but because the highrated game ended 
early enough to keep cbs from edging nbc for the victory the weekly 
ac nielsen co ratings 
nbc won the week its 29th in a row by a tenth of a rating point 
over cbs 155 to 154 it was cbs highest average rating since 
march 1987 abc had a 128 
cbs also got help from monday night football but on the other 
two networks abc and nbc split the audience with competing college 
bowl games 
when you have two bowl games head to head and the competition 
appeals to a different audience theyre going to get a big 
number said jaffe 
sure enough cbs monday shows designing women murphy 
brown and almost grown had their highest ratings of the season 
cbs won the new ratings race decisively thanks to preemptions 
on nbc and abc for football last monday the cbs evening news 
had a rating of 135 and a 23 share abc world news tonight had 
a 123 and 21 nbc nightly news had an 116 and 20 
each rating point equals 904000 homes with television the share 
is a percentage of sets in use 
cbs new talk show starring pat sajak didnt go up against nbcs

japans decision to retain its cap on car 
exports to the united states drew little praise in this country 
with reaction split between those who wanted the voluntary export 
quotas lowered and those who say the restraints are no longer useful 
two of the big three us automakers ford motor co and chrysler 
corp welcomed the decision announced tuesday in tokyo while 
chrysler said the restraints were needed to keep the us auto 
industry healthy ford broadened its justification for the quotas by 
saying they should remain in place until the united states has 
approached trade equity with japan in products ranging from steel 
and textiles to semiconductors 
general motors corp called the quotas irrelevant in a market 
where japanese makers have consistently shipped fewer cars than the 
number allowed by their government 
the extension is almost symbolic gm said the quotas 
are not constraining shipments from japan and are not expected to 
under current market conditions 
japans minister of international trade and industry hiroshi 
mitsuzuka said tuesday in tokyo that japan would continue to limit 
car exports to the united states to 23 million vehicles annually 
and predicted shipments in fiscal year ending next march would fall 
100000 vehicles short of the quota 
he said the decision to continue the voluntary restraints was 
taken out of concern that uninhibited car exports would trigger 
protectionist sentiment in the united states 
japan unilaterally adopted the quotas in 1981 as a way to dampen 
calls for legal restrictions on imports of asian cars 
the action came amid a deep depression in the us auto industry 
high gasoline prices that steered car buyers from detroits larger 
products to more fuel efficient smaller cars and a strong dollar 
that gave imports a price advantage over domestic products 
the auto industry has since recovered its strength in part 
through adopting japanesestyle production methods and as gasoline 
prices have dropped the publics taste has swung back toward larger 
vehicles made by detroit 
also the dollar has been sharply devalued against the yen 
forcing japanese automakers to raise dollar prices to cover their 
production and shipping costs 
the shifting marketplace has altered the nature of the quotas 
from a policy that protects us makers to one that increases their 
competition said david healy automotive analyst with the new york 
brokerage house of drexel burnham lambert 
the japanese being smart businessmen have gotten around the 
quotas in many ways he said one is to build more cars in the 
united states more domestic competition 
another is to ship more expensive cars to the united states 
since the quotas are based on the number of vehicles not their 
dollar value healy said 
the japanese announcement did little to appease the chairman of 
the house energy and commerce committee rep john dingell dmich 
who said the quota fixes the number so high it really doesnt 
matter 
the united auto workers union praised the japanese decision while 
expressing disappointment that the quotas had not been made more 
stringent 
as usual the current administration was of no assistance in 
persuading the japanese to renew the quotas said uaw president 
owen bieber 
japans trade deficit with the united states totalled 598 
billion in 1987 japanese companies made 733000 cars in the united 
states last year through november 232 percent more than in the 
corresponding period a year earlier

a new pentagonpublished book on terrorism 
doesnt break new ground on the issue but officials say it should 
make americans more aware of the threat terrorism represents to 
national security interests 
the book terrorist group profiles describes the abu nidal 
group in the middle east as the most dangerous terrorist 
organization in existence 
charles s whitehouse assistant defense secretary for special 
operations and lowintensity conflict said the 131page book 
published tuesday should be helpful as a comprehensive reference 
document 
this is not an intelligence document but rather a compilation 
of opensource material that has been verified by classified 
sources whitehouse added 
copies will be distributed starting today to public government 
agencies to public libraries as well as to government libraries it 
will also be distributed to law enforcement activities diplomatic 
posts and domestic and overseas department of defense components and 
activities he said 
whitehouse said the publication had nothing to do with recent 
reagan administration claims that libya is building a plant that 
could supply chemical weapons to terrorists 
the official said that while libya appears to be increasing its 
support of terrorism around the world iran must still be considered

the discovery of a river of gas flowing toward the 
middle of the milky way supports the belief that an infinitely dense 
speck more massive than 1 million suns lies at the heart of the 
earths galaxy astronomers say 
the speck is known as a black hole collapsed stars with such 
intense gravitational pull that nothing can escape from it not even 
light while many astronomers believe that a massive black hole 
exists at the core of the milky way this has still not been proven 
in research presented tuesday astronomers described their 
discovery of a 90trillionmilelong stream of gas that apparently 
is being sucked across the heavens into the black hole 
although black holes cannot be seen astronomers look for other 
evidence of their existence such as the tug of their gravity on 
nearby celestial objects 
paul ho who directed the research at the harvardsmithsonian 
center for astrophysics in cambridge noted that the galaxys center 
is a gravitational well 
we think that stars drift toward the center he said its 
a natural place for a massive black hole to form 
hos radio telescope observation was made with astronomers from 
the max planck institute in munich and the university of cologne 
both in west germany and the massachusetts institute of technology 
the report was presented at a meeting of the american 
astronomical society here 
this is a complex region bonnerd j teegarden of nasas 
goddard space flight center in greenbelt md said of the study 
results like these are adding a lot to our understanding 
teegarden said that most astronomers believe that a massive black 
hole exists at the center of the milky way 
he noted that the nature of this and other black holes is one of 
the most exciting areas of research and speculation in astronomy 
it pushes hard on the basic concepts of physics he said 
physicists dont really know what happens when you collapse a 
million solar masses of matter down to a point the laws of physics 
as we know them in the laboratory are inadequate to explain such an 
extreme situation 
earlier astronomers have spotted signs of a massive gaseous 
cloud spinning around the milky ways center which is 30000 light 
years from earth in the constellation sagittarius a light year is 6 
trillion miles the distance light travels in a year 
scientists believe the cloud is circling a black hole that is 1 
million times more massive than the sun they theorize that parts of 
the cloud constantly fall into the black hole 
perhaps the equivalent of onethousandth of the mass of the sun 
spirals into the black hole each year this produces tremendous 
amounts of kinetic energy the energy released by motion 
these black holes could be the most powerful generators that we 
know about said ho 
astronomers believe that black holes provide the energy of 
quasars enormously powerful radio emitters that are the most 
distant objects in the universe 
the latest discovery suggests that a stream of gas snakes across 
space providing the fuel that keeps the milky ways black hole 
going 
ho believes that a recent stellar explosion called a supernova 
knocked loose part of a large nearby island of gas this in turn 
was grabbed by the gravity of the black hole and pulled in a stream 
into its own orbiting cloud

thailand has forcibly repatriated 
burmese students to their homeland subjecting them to possible 
detention and harsh treatment by burmas military government 
amnesty international says 
the londonbased human rights organization said tuesday that 
thailand on jan 6 forcibly returned 22 students who had fled 
neighboring burma after a bloody military coup sept 18 
in a statement telexed to news agencies in bangkok today amnesty 
said it feared the 22 and other students previously repatriated by 
thailand may have been detained and abused by security personnel in 
burma 
thai authorities have denied forcing any students back and the 
burmese government claims they are treated well on their return 
amnesty international said its concern was based on increasing 
evidence that many political prisoners arrested for having been 
actively involved in the marchseptember uprising have been held 
incommunicado without charge or trial since their arrest and that 
some of them have been subjected to torture or other forms of severe 
treatment 
its concern was also based on information that thant zin who 
was repatriated last dec 26 with some 80 other students is said to 
have been arrested after arriving in his home town of mergui in 
burmas southern tenasserim division he has apparently been held 
incommunicado since his arrest and his current whereabouts are 
unknown 
the statement said the group of 22 students who were forcibly 
repatriated included sai myon wyn tun and kyai moe both age 23 who 
had taken leading roles in the august and september demonstrations 
for democracy in their hometown of taunggyi in shan state 
it said the 22 were part of a group of 36 students of the shan 
ethnic minority whom thai police rounded up two weeks ago in mae 
hong son province bordering burma 
the statement said they are said to have repeatedly expressed 
fears for their safety and to have petitioned the thai authorities 
not to be returned to burma and eventually went on a hunger strike 
they are understood to have been forced to board a plane from tak 
airport on jan 6 1989 by thai army personnel they 14 remaining 
students are believed to be still held in tak airport pending 
similar repatriation 
thousands of students who had been at the forefront of the 
campaign for democracy fled to thai border areas controlled by 
ethnicbased insurgents after military commander gen saw maungs 
troops seized power and killed hundreds of unarmed demonstrators 
thailand initially promised the students temporary asylum 
but that changed after thai army chief gen chavalit yongchaiyudh 
visited burma on dec 14 becoming the first foreign dignitary to 
visit since the coup 
he and saw maung reached an agreement to repatriate the students 
and two processing centers were established in northern tak 
province and another north of bangkok 
amnesty international said that under the present policy 
students who did not return home faced two other choices return to 
the malarial jungles to fight alongside the insurgents or be tried 
as illegal immigrants in thailand 
the thai cabinet on tuesday extended to march 31 a deadline for 
the students to return home chavalit has proposed to the cabinet 
that those who fail to report themselves for repatriation by then be 
sent back after being charged with illegal entry the thai newspaper 
the nation said today 
the us state department said on jan 5 that it was looking into 
credible reports that some students had been arrested on their 
return and died in custody 
the next day burmese government spokesman kyaw sann responded 
rumors about arrests and deaths of students in government custody 
are absolutely unfounded and malicious 
two us senators richard lugar rind and thad cochran 
rmiss discussed the issue with chavalit in a meeting tuesday in 
bangkok 
the nation said today that the senators were told by the general 
the students were being offered the chance to return to continue 
their studies and to build democracy by peaceful means

a former navy enlisted man tried to sell 
submarine warfare secrets to the soviets because he had been 
discharged for indecent exposure according to authorities who said 
no damaging information was passed along 
craig d kunkle 39 was arrested tuesday at a williamsburg motel 
as he tried to turn over classified documents to two undercover fbi 
agents posing as soviet officials said irvin b wells iii head of 
the fbis norfolk office 
kunkle a former chief petty officer was charged with attempting 
to deliver classified information to a foreign government if 
convicted he could be sentenced to life in prison 
kunkle of virginia beach was discharged from the navy in 
october 1985 as nonjudicial punishment for multiple acts of 
indecent exposure committed at the barbers point naval air station 
in hawaii according to an fbi affidavit filed in us district 
court 
beginning early last month kunkle talked six times with an fbi 
undercover agent whom he believed to be a representative of the 
soviet embassy in washington the affidavit said 
during each of these conversations kunkle discussed various 
aspects of his military background and experience and his desire to 
sell classified united states navy military secrets to the soviet 
union for monetary gain and as revenge for his discharge from the 
united states navy the affidavit said 
it did not specify how much money kunkle is alleged to have 
expected for the documents 
the court papers said kunkle was a specialist who installed 
submarine monitoring equipment on navy aircraft he served in the 
north atlantic indian and western pacific oceans and gained 
security clearance in 1984 when he was designated an antisubmarine 
warfare supervisor 
he was working alone in his attempts to sell the information to 
the soviets said wells 
kunkles wife suzanne a kunkle is enlisted in the navy we 
are interviewing her but theres no indication of any involvement 
on her behalf wells said 
kunkle was first identified by counterintelligence surveillance 
of telephone calls to the soviet embassy in washington said a 
source who spoke on condition of anonymity us counterintelligence 
agencies routinely monitor telephone calls to the embassy in an 
effort to prevent spying 
the case is unrelated to the norfolkarea spy ring led by former 
navy sailor john walker who is serving a life sentence for selling 
valuable navy secrets to the soviets fbi spokesman charles w 
steinmetz said 
the affidavit said that on dec 9 kunkle mailed a packet of 
documents photographs diagrams and related information to the 
undercover fbi agent at an alexandria post office box 
kunkle told the agent his intention was to demonstrate the type 
of classified information he was capable of providing to the soviet 
union then and in future contacts the affidavit said 
the navy determined on dec 14 that the information was 
classified as secret and could harm national security if released to 
the soviet union the court papers said 
weve prevented the soviet union from receiving this highly 
sensitive information wells said 
at a court appearance kunkle said he made about 260 a week as a 
security guard at portsmouth general hospital and worked as a 
parttime investigator for ccp pinkerton investigative services 
us magistrate tommy e miller ordered kunkle jailed pending a 
preliminary hearing thursday and granted his request for a 
courtappointed attorney 
verlon newman a friend of kunkle said he felt angry and 
betrayed by the arrest he described kunkle as a typical 
allamerican looking guy

the arrest of the head of mexicos powerful 
oil workers union on armssmuggling charges amounts to the opening 
salvo in a political war mounted by newly inaugurated president 
carlos salinas de gortari 
joaquin hernandez galicia known as la quina is a wealthy man 
with enormous political influence who has dispensed patronage to his 
faithful and commanded the loyalty of hundreds of thousands of oil 
workers 
within hours of his arrest thousands of workers walked off the 
job and troops were guarding installations of the stateowned pemex 
oil monopoly 
critics term hernandez galicia 66 the jimmy hoffa of mexico 
admirers see the former welder as a beloved padrino who hands 
out jobs and favors attending to the welfare of his subjects and 
guaranteeing the election of state legislators mayors and city 
councilmen 
challenging la quina is a bold move for salinas who took office 
dec 1 and provides a quick test of his vow to modernize the 
nations political and economic system 
la quina is a classic product of the system that suddenly turned 
on him tuesday when soldiers shot their way into his fortresslike 
home in ciudad madero and arrested him on gunrunning charges a 
federal agent was killed in the raid 
the bad blood between salinas and the union goes back several 
years when salinas was budget director under his predecessor 
miguel de la madrid and pushed through economic reforms that cut 
into the unions concessions 
like other labor bosses who felt threatened by salinas talk of 
reform la quina made no secret of his unhappiness when de la madrid 
chose salinas as his successor the union gave salinas only lukewarm 
support during one of the most hotly contested presidential races in 
mexican history 
a source close to the new president said salinas and his people 
suspect la quina had covertly financed opposition candidate 
cuauhtemoc cardenas 
the rift between the salinas camp and the union widened after the 
election when the union accused a top official of the governing 
institutional revolutionary party gov ramon beteta of mexico 
state of committing fraud in his previous post as pemexs head 
salinas is going to have to put some union leaders in jail 
political analyst adolfo aguilar predicted in an interview shortly 
before salinas took office 
la quinas power stems from its symbiotic relationship between 
the unions and the party that has governed mexico for 60 years it 
is a relationship in which power and profit are exchanged for votes 
and peace in the workplace 
salinas is not the first president to threaten to clean up the 
unions de la madrid had made moral renovation the centerpiece 
of his campaign 
destroying la quina is a necessary step in the moral 
renovation political analyst lorenzo meyer said five years ago 
but la quina survived heading an empire that possessed lucrative 
oil drilling contracts and construction companies to funeral 
parlors ranches and union stores 
although he gave up the post of union secretary general more than 
20 years ago la quina still is de facto leader of a union often 
accused of murder extortion and fraud that doesnt matter to his 
supporters 
the people here love him a lot he is like their father said 
a veteran journalist in tampico which adjoins la quinas home turf 
in ciudad madero on the coast of the gulf of mexico 
in more than 30 years of union politics la quina turned the oil 
workers union into a political and financial powerhouse 
the union won sweeping concessions from pemex in exchange for 
peace and political support for the institutional revolutionary 
party or pri 
among those concessions was the right to handle half the outside 
drilling contracts and the right to dole out jobs with pemex 
hundreds of millions of dollars have flowed legally through the 
union as a result and critics say the union has also amassed a 
fortune under the table

about three civil rights workers slayings would bring negative 
publicity no matter what he did 
well we didnt want to get any bad publicity for the town and 
thats the only reason i didnt want to run it here shelly 
steiger said in announcing his change of mind but it looks like 
were going to get it anyway 
residents may have to wait some time to see the picture here 
though steiger said he contacted orion pictures in atlanta on 
tuesday but wasnt told when the film would be available 
they only have so many prints and i have to wait until the big 
cities get through with them the 64yearold steiger said im 
playing pictures now that played in meridian back in november and 
december meridian is a city of 45000 residents about 40 miles 
southeast of here

nationally friday 
steigers mother lulu ellis who owns the 500seat ellis 
theater said earlier this week that she and her son had decided not 
to show the movie she said church groups were threatening to 
boycott the theater if it showed the movie 
during most movies at the theater blacks customarily sit in the 
balcony while whites a few blacks and choctaw indians sit down in 
the orchestra seats steiger said this was by custom and was not 
required by the theater management the film is an account of the 
deaths of james earl chaney 21 who was black and whites andrew 
goodman 20 and michael schwerner 24 the three disappeared june 
21 1964 after they were released from jail in philadelphia they

soggy earthen dam near here

case and was directed by alan parker

the theater 
i dont know of course were just a small town so we dont 
have that kind of draw steiger said im not just showing it 
for the money if people want to see it thats their prerogative 
and if they want to see it bad enough they can go to meridian

moslem factions for dominance of lebanons largest sect has split 
families and jeopardizes the strategic alliance between their 
masters iran and syria 
amid the carnage of lebanons 13year civil war between 
christians and moslems and the countrys myriad other miniwars 
between feuding militias the shiite conflict has fractured 
lebanons largest sect 
shiite sources said the battle has pitted brother against 
brother father against son as they side either with the 
fundamentalist iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god or the 
secular prosyrian amal militia led by lebanons justice minister 
nabih berri 
more than 500 people many of them civilians have been killed 
and about 1500 wounded since the intershiite rivalry broke into 
open warfare in april 
in beiruts southern slums a shiite bastion devastated by the 
fighting huge posters of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and imam mousa 
sadr amals charismatic founder who mysteriously disappeared in 
libya in 1978 hang side by side indicating a false unity among the 
1 million shiites 
the two sides have vied for years for control of the countrys 
shiite community now one of lebanons most powerful sects 
hezbollah at the cutting edge of khomeinis islamic revolution 
abroad seeks to create an iranianstyle islamic republic in lebanon 
it has built an impressive tehranfunded social educational and 
welfare network that has in the past few years been pumping an 
estimated 5 million a month into hezbollahs coffers this has 
wooed many shiites from amal 
the more nationalist amal armed by syria wants to reunite 
divided lebanon under a multisect government in which the moslem 
majority will share power equally with the traditionally dominant 
christians 
any moslem who willingly abides by the rules of a nonmoslem 
state is a traitor says a hezbollah slogan daubed on walls in the 
squalid slums of south beirut 
traitors are those who kidnap foreigners and carry out acts of 
terrorism all over the world to serve irans interests at the 
expense of lebanons shiites said amals security chief in the 
southern port of tyre who identified himself only as hamza 
hezbollah is considered the parent organization for shiite 
fundamentalist factions who hold most of the 15 western hostages 
kidnapped in lebanon 
lebanese and western intelligence agencies also blame hezbollah 
zealots for the 1983 suicide bombings of us and french targets in 
lebanon in which hundreds of people were killed as well as other 
terrorist attacks in the middle east and western europe 
all lebanons shiites are branded terrorists because of such 
acts hamza said many lebanese shiites have been deported from 
foreig countries because of this 
amal drove hezbollah out of the tyre region and most of south 
lebanon in april in a crackdown that followed the feb 17 kidnapping 
of us marine lt col william higgins 
the following month the fundamentalists trained by iranian 
revolutionary guards based in the bekaa valley of eastern lebanon 
seized large chunks of amal territory in beiruts southern slums 
they have repeatedly clashed since despite efforts by syria and 
iran to cool tempers 
several amal leaders have been assassinated among them was 
amals south lebanon commander daoud daoud and two senior 
lieutenants their car was riddled by unidentified gunmen as they 
drove through south beirut in october amal blamed hezbollah 
the fundamentalists accuse amal of preventing them from carrying 
out the holy duty of jihad holy war to liberate palestine from 
zionist occupation 
to liberate the holy city of jerusalem and the rest of 
palestine is the duty of every moslem hezbollahs weekly magazine 
alaahd said in a recent editorial 
amal believes that the liberation of palestine is a collective 
duty of all arabs and moslems said abu hassan qobeissi amals 
security commander in south lebanon 
speaking from his headquarters in the hilltop village of zifta 
25 miles northeast of tyre he said hezbollah will not be allowed 
back into the south to fire a missile into northern israel and 
provoke the israelis into demolishing our villages and towns with 
their planes 
amals main military objective is limited to driving the israelis 
out of their selfproclaimed security zone a strip of lebanese 
border territory running from the mediterranean coast to mount 
hermon they have occupied since 1985

the tragic 1937 crash of the german 
dirigible hindenburg was a part of broadcaster herbert morrisons 
life until the day he died his widow and friends say 
millions of radio listeners hung on morrisons frantic 
description as the giant airship crashed and burned 52 years ago 
morrison died tuesday at a nursing home after a long illness he was 
83 
he was a quiet man and very unassuming said his widow mary 
jane morrison but he was very proud that he was able to do that 
broadcast 
morrison was a 31yearold reporter for chicago radio station wls 
on may 6 1937 when he described the explosion of the hindenburg as 
it approached its landing in lakehurst nj thirtysix of the 97 
people aboard died 
as the only broadcaster at the scene morrison became the eyes 
and ears of the world listeners heard him choke back tears as he 
gave his account of the explosion the fire and people falling from 
the sky 
its burst into flame yes its started its fire and its 
crashing its crashing terrible oh my morrison screamed into 
his microphone as the dirigible nearly three football fields long 
exploded while easing toward its mooring oh the humanity 
all the passengers i dont believe it 
morrison recalled the tragedy in a 1986 interview 
we saw things falling out of the hindenburg he said we 
had only a few seconds to have it dawn on you that it was a tragedy 
some of the things falling out were people 
he became quite a hero said 90yearold george biggar who 
as program director helped convince wls general manager to send 
morrison to lakehurst 
it is one of the greatest special events of all time on radio 
its a shame that hes gone biggar said in a telephone interview 
from fargo nd 
morrison a native of scottdale pa was admitted to the sundale 
nursing home in morgantown in september because of a longterm 
illness said sherry rice an administrator at the facility 
he began his journalism career in fairmont after graduating from 
scottdale high school in 1923 
morrison served in the army air corps during world war ii and 
later became the first news director at television station wtae in 
pittsburgh he retired after developing a radio and television 
section for the university relations department at west virginia 
university 
he talked about it once now and then said charles mcgrath 
64 a cinematographer who worked with morrison at wtae what 
struck me about him and that incident is he never got over it 
he was beside himself on that recording i think it always 
stayed with him it followed him all his life 
services were scheduled for thursday in scottdale

a case stemming from wiretap evidence obtained in a 
7 million wells fargo robbery investigation could have a 
farreaching impact on puerto ricos status as a us commonwealth 
the 1st us circuit court of appeals heard arguments tuesday on 
the legality of federal wiretapping on the island in the civil case 
camacho vs the puerto rico telephone co 
a ruling is not expected for at least a month 
at issue is a provision in the 35yearold puerto rico 
constitution that forbids any telephone wiretapping as part of 
citizens rights to privacy 
the plaintiffs believe that because puerto rico does not enjoy 
the status of the 50 states its citizens should not be subject to 
federal laws that violate their constitution puerto ricans dont 
have the right to vote in us elections dont have a voting member 
of congress and dont pay federal income tax 
we have no access to the way the laws are enacted said 
charles heymaestre one of the attorneys who brought the lawsuit on 
behalf of the defendants in the wells fargo trial in hartford conn 
heymaestre represents the instituto puertorriqueno de derechos 
civiles a puerto ricanbased civil rights organization and the 
center for constitutional rights a new yorkbased public law 
organization in puerto rico that first filed the suit in puerto rico 
where a federal judge there dismissed the lawsuit 
attorneys representing the telephone company said company 
officials had no choice but to obey the fbis request to place 
wiretaps they claimed tuesday that the lawsuit asks the court to 
interfere in congressional matters 
it is not in the function of this court to act as a political 
branch of the government said lino saldana an attorney for the 
puerto rico telephone co congress has legislated on a matter of 
national concern and made that legislation applicable to puerto 
rico it has given puerto rico a treatment it has accorded all the 
states in the union 
thats the rub said judge hugh bownes interrupting saldana 
saldana also contended that the company cannot be sued because a 
1964 federal law provides immunity for communications carriers from 
liability for their assistance of federal officers in pursuit of 
criminals 
the appeals court case dates to 1984 when the telephone company 
obeyed a federal court order obtained by the fbi to place wiretaps 
on the phones of several alleged members of the macheteros an armed 
underground group fighting for puerto ricos independence 
five of those subsequently arrested with the aid of the wiretaps 
are on trial in hartford on charges of conspiring to rob the 
hartford wells fargo armored car company of 7 million in 1983 
the five have claimed they are prisoners of war and are being 
targeted because of their advocacy of puerto rican independence 
the wiretap tapes are in evidence against the defendants in 
hartford attorneys said that the tapes could be inadmissible if the 
court rules that federal wiretapping in puerto rico is 
unconstitutional

a judge has barred operation rescue which gained 
attention with its protests during the democratic national 
convention from obstructing anyone entering area abortion clinics 
us district judge robert ward issued the permanent injunction 
against the binghamtonbased group tuesday at the request of lawyers 
for womens organizations and clinics that had sued in april 
a lawyer for the plaintiffs said his clients asked for a 
permanent injunction when they learned that operation rescue had 
planned another series of protests here for thursday friday and 
saturday 
ward ordered that if the injunction is violated a 25000 fine 
will be imposed against operation rescue on the first day and 
doubled for each additional day it is violated 
the injunction does not preclude members of operation rescue from 
protesting on sidewalks outside abortion facilities 
but the order bars them from trespassing on the grounds of 
clinics in new york and nassau suffolk and westchester counties or 
obstructing people from entering the buildings it also prohibits 
members from physically abusing or harassing anyone who seeks 
services or works at clinics where abortions are performed 
michael tierney a lawyer for operation rescue declined to 
comment about the order because he had not seen it 
david cole a lawyer at the center for constitutional rights 
which represented the plaintiffs said the judge had previously 
issued two temporary restraining orders against members of operation 
rescue 
the first was in response to a weeklong demonstration by the 
group in may and the second was for demonstrations planned in 
october said cole 
ward fined operation rescue 50000 for demonstrations actually 
carried out at two clinics in may the fine has not yet been paid 
he said 
the plaintiffs in this case include the national organization for 
women and clinics in the area cole said 
more than 450 antiabortion demonstrators were arrested in 
atlanta during last summers democratic convention since then it 
has held demonstrations in cities including new york indianapolis 
milwaukee detroit philadelphia and boston

police officers in a nowdisbanded narcotics 
unit stole tens of thousands of dollars in drugs and cash from 
dealers and divided the proceeds among themselves a former member 
of the elite squad testified 
leo ryan also said he falsified a police report on a 1982 search 
of a suspected drug dealers home in exchange for a 1000 bribe 
from a prominent attorney 
we really didnt care if they got convicted or not ryan said 
of the dealers 
the excop turned informant testified in us district court 
tuesday at the racketeering and conspiracy trial of former lt john 
wilson and five other members of the defunct 5 squad which was 
created in 1980 to combat drug trafficking 
ryan the governments first witness in the trial that began last 
week described more than two dozen searches during which officers 
stole drugs or money the drugs were resold to other dealers and the 
proceeds split he said 
the indictment alleges the officers stole drugs and more than 
400000 in cash from dealers 
ryan who was convicted last year of tax evasion said he first 
stole drugs in 1982 when he and several defendants found two trash 
bags containing marijuana during a search of a home 
former officer david grove one of the defendants suggested 
taking some of the marijuana ryan said he said he objected but 
grove and another squad member charles hund assured him that 
they knew a guy they could sell the drugs to they could trust 
him and i didnt have to worry about it ryan said he later 
received 1000 
hund is expected to testify for the prosecution 
ryan testified that one of the biggest hauls occurred on june 13 
1983 when officers found nearly 250000 in cash while searching 
the home of walter roeder a suspected dealer 
ryan said wilson had him tell roeder the officers would turn the 
cash over to the irs if roeder didnt give them some of it roeder 
who is expected to testify for the prosecution eventually agreed to 
give the officers half of the money ryan said 
we were all pretty happy and celebrated at dinner before 
returning to headquarters where wilson divided the cash in his 
office ryan said 
ryan also said he received 1000 from charles peruto jr a 
prominent criminal attorney for falsifying a report on the 1982 
search of the home of a suspected drug dealer he represented during 
which drugs were found 
peruto later said ryans testimony was absolutely false 
perutos name is not mentioned in the indictment and prosecutors 
declined to comment on ryans allegation 
wilson and the other defendants are charged with a racketeering 
conspiracy and other crimes including bribery of public officials 
extortion robbery selling drugs seized from dealers filing false 
police reports and filing false income tax returns if convicted on 
all charges they face prison terms ranging from 20 years to 80 
years 
in addition to wilson and grove the other defendants are former 
officers ronald giongo richard jumper frances hilt and james

a federal judges ruling upholding the right of 
a lesbian to reenlist in the army reserve will have a widespread 
impact her attorney says 
us district judge myron gordon ruled tuesday that a regulation 
barring reenlistment of homosexuals violated first amendment rights 
of miriam benshalom because it unreasonably chills the right to 
freedom of speech 
he said it also unfairly discriminates against people who have a 
homosexual orientation whether they engage in homosexual activity 
or not 
the decision will have an impact all over the country in 
similar cases said patrick berigan who represented benshalom 
benshalom 40 a sergeant was discharged from the army reserve 
in 1976 because of her homosexuality after a series of court 
actions she was reinstated in september 1987 
but the army refused her attempt to reenlist in august causing 
gordon to find the army in contempt of court in september 
the army then allowed her to reenlist pending the ruling that 
gordon made tuesday 
gordon said there was no evidence indicating benshalom engaged 
in homosexual acts 
although the army has a compelling interest in sexual issues 
the elimination of all soldiers with homosexual orientations from 
the ranks of the army is not rationally related to the advancement 
of any compelling government interest the judge said 
kenneth kohl a us justice department attorney said the army 
probably would appeal the ruling 
berigan said the ruling would allow benshalom to retain her post 
with the armys 5091st reception battalion 
the decision he said should help homosexuals preserve their 
rightful roles in the military

james walsh

murder in the slaying of dr kathryn hinnant 33 whose body was 
found in her office sunday morning 
smith had been secretly living in an equipment room on the 22nd 
floor of the hospital since last month police said he had 
apparently moved freely throughout the 25story building often

at smiths arraignment executive assistant district attorney 
james kindler said smith told police after his arrest that he had 
strangled hinnant while forcibly stealing her coat jewelry and

the us aircraft carrier theodore roosevelt 
and the nine warships in its battle group sailed through the strait 
of gilbraltar and into the mediterranean early today the navy said 
lt ray kempisty a spokesman for the us 6th fleet said the 
two marine amphibious groups that sailed from the united states with 
the roosevelt were still at rota spain but would soon follow the 
carrier group into the mediterranean 
the carrier group arrived a week after two f14s from the 
aircraft carrier john f kennedy shot down two libyan mig 23s over 
the mediterranean tensions between the united states and libya 
already were high after washington threatened to attack an alleged 
chemical weapons factory near tripoli 
libya contends the united states is provoking confrontation in 
the area by sending the roosevelt to the mediterranean it claims 
the ship will be used to attack libya 
the arrival of the roosevelt gives the united states two carrier 
battle groups in the mediterranean but kempisty said the roosevelt 
is basically a replacement for the kennedy which we expect to 
return to the united states 
the roosevelt is accompanied by six destroyers two cruisers a 
frigate an ammunition ship an oiler and a repair ship the navy 
said earlier that about 15000 sailors and marines were with the 
carrier group 
kempisty said it was the first visit to the mediterranean by the 
roosevelt and the leyte gulf a guidedmissile cruiser 
he said the roosevelt was carrying about 80 aircraft including 
the new fa18s which he said can function both as an interceptor 
and a bomber he said all aircraft carriers carry some attack planes 
and that the fa18s are normally on the roosevelt and were not added 
for this cruise

launchers and tanks on tuesday night to shell 500 hezbollah 
guerrillas they had cornered in an enclave near israels 
selfproclaimed security zone 
amal forces backed by syriansupplied t54 battle tanks tried 
four times to storm hezbollah positions around the strategic village 
of jbaa but were driven back police said 
a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations said the amal fighters are facing tough resistance 
from the hezbollahis who are manning firing positions in the 
mountains 
police said amal fighters were regrouping today for a new 
offensive against jbaa 10 miles southeast of sidon and the key to 
hezbollahs defense lines 
amal blocked hezbollahs supply lines to the fundamentalists 
9squaremile bastion which extends from jbaa to the nearby hamlets 
of ein bouswar and louwaizeh a hezbollah base and the wooded 
slopes of mount safi 
during one of their attacks tuesday amal fighters broke into 
jbaa in savage fighting but hezbollah counterattacked to push them 
back 
amal on monday recaptured four neighboring villages in the 
southern iklim eltiffah or apple province which had fallen to 
hezbollah the day before 
amals leader in south lebanon atef aoun said on tuesday his 
militia was determined to finish off hezbollah in the south 
we were stabbed in the back by hezbollah the price that 
hezbollah has to pay will be its existance in the south 
the fighting raged despite efforts by irans first deputy foreign 
minister ali mohammad besharati and syrian president hafez assad 
to end the bloodshed 
syria with 40000 troops in lebanon is the main power broker in 
the warbattered mediterranean country it was irans main arab ally 
in the war against iraq but hezbollahs challenge to its power in 
lebanon has put that strategic alliance under increasing strain 
besharati and assad met in the syrian capital of damascus 
tuesday beiruts prosyrian ashsharq daily said they agreed to 
continue efforts to find a settlement 
hezbollah seeks to create an iranianstyle islamic republic in 
lebanon the more secular nationalist amal favors a multisect 
government in lebanon with moslems sharing power equally with the 
long dominant christians 
amal drove hezbollah out of most of south lebanon in april a 
month later hezbollah ousted amal from most of south beirut in 
three weeks of fighting about 380 people were killed and 1150 
wounded in those battles 
syria deployed troops in south beirut to quell the fighting but 
fighting flared again in november with 42 people killed and 87 
wounded

woman with cyanidelaced pain relievers has asked for a new trial 
because a jurors involvement in an unrelated producttampering case 
was not disclosed 
an attorney for stella nickell raised the issue on monday before 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals

mrs nickell was convicted may 9 of causing the producttampering 
deaths in 1986 of her husband bruce nickell 52 and sue katherine 
snow 40 they died after taking extrastrength excedrin capsules 
laced with cyanide

a manufacturers recall 
mrs nickell was sentenced to 90 years in prison 
public defender thomas hillier asked for a new trial for mrs 
nickell last spring but us district judge william dwyer denied 
the request

republic of montenegro offered to resign today in the face of 
protests by tens of thousands of people demanding new leadership and 
economic reform media reports said 
about 50000 demonstrators took to the streets again today in 
titograd the regional capital belgrade radio said police ringed 
the republics parliament building to block the jostling chanting 
crowd the radio said 
many of the 60000 people who massed outside parliament on 
tuesday chanted slogans such as down with armchair leaders 
down with scoundrels and we want free elections the 
demonstrators demanded their leaders step down because of their 
failure to reverse the republics economic woes 
in the republic of slovenia today a group of citizens announced 
the establishment of the slovenian democratic union the first 
independent political group to be set up in yugoslavia the union 
will strive for parliamentary democracy free elections and the 
open competition of ideas said dimitrij rupel a prominent 
author and the groups founder 
the latest demonstrations in montenegro follow the resignation of 
the republics government but not party leaders in october 
during similar protests police broke up those protests and party 
leaders refused to resign 
the political turmoil in montenegro also follows nationwide 
protests during much of last year that toppled some regional and 
national leaders 
the government of premier branko mukulic resigned dec 20 over 
250 percent annual inflation and other economic problems it was the 
first time the government of yugoslavia had stepped down since the 
communists took power here after world war ii 
the state news agency tanjug said montenegros communist party 
central committee its policymaking body would meet tonight to 
consider the offer of resignation from party leaders and the 
collectivelyheld state presidency the republics parliament will 
convene saturday to consider the state presidencys resignation from 
the largely ceremonial post tanjug said 
montenegro is one of the poorest of yugoslavias six republics 
with an unemployment rate of 25 percent the republic has been hit 
hard by a recent spate of closures of unprofitable firms that put 
10000 people out of work 
the new slovenian democratic union was to hold its constituent 
assembly in ljubljana later today and jan 11 1989 will be 
considered as the date of its formal constitution activists said 
the slovenian democratic union will nominate its members for 
parliament and other leading functions in the republic 
the unions first task will be the writing of slovenias new 
constitution which will be much more democratic and would unlike 
the current one envisage multiparty democracy rupel said 
the slovenian democratic union is only the first of several 
political associations that have announced their plans to be 
formally constituted in the liberal republic of slovenia the region 
widely considered as the most democratic in communistruled eastern 
europe 
the emergence of independent parties comes at a time when 
yugoslavia is in the throes of its deepest political and economic 
crisis in history which includes europes highest inflation of 
about 250 percent a year largescale unemployment and increasing 
labor and social unrest

a mixup in which the caskets of two 
victims of last months pan am jetliner bombing were shipped to the 
wrong cities was straightened out and the remains returned to the 
right families 
the casket containing the body of 20yearold karen hunt was 
flown from boston and arrived at a rochester funeral home tuesday 
and the body of mary l johnson 25 of wayland mass was flown 
from rochester to boston 
ms johnsons relatives were an hour from burying the body they 
thought was hers sunday when fbi agents informed them of the mixup 
the mistake was discovered last week when the medical examiners 
office in rochester concluded that the body sent to the hunt family 
was not ms hunt 
ms hunts father robert hunt said the family planned a prayer 
service but would not bury her until spring when the ground thaws 
weve got her body back now said hunt well never get 
over this but at least we can start the healing process 
gregory jones an fbi spokesman in washington said authorities 
recovering bodies from the dec 21 explosion over lockerbie 
scotland apparently correctly identified the bodies of the two 
women but somehow flew the caskets to the wrong cities 
we have no feelings at all of anger and bitterness about 
this ms johnsons father robert johnson said earlier this 
week its one of those simple mistakes that can be made it seems 
terrible at the time but its not a big mistake 
the body reported to be ms hunts arrived thursday in rochester 
the family was already concerned that it was not her because 
scottish authorities description of the clothing on the body didnt 
seem to match ms hunts clothes the medical examiners office 
confirmed their suspicions 
ms hunt was returning to new york after completing a semester in 
london as part of a syracuse university program 
ms johnson a graduate of brown university was returning to 
wayland for christmas with her family after spending 14 months 
abroad touring india and teaching english in taiwan

a woman who was allowed to decide her rapists 
fate chose a pleabargained 4year sentence that will put him 
behind bars immediately then said of being asked to choose 
wasnt that something 
he was so kind the 65yearold victim said of hennepin 
county judge william posten he said its your decision i 
liked that 
posten called the victim into his chambers monday and gave her 
two choices in the prosecution of james halvorson 25 she could 
have the case go to trial and hope for a conviction which could 
have meant a nineyear prison term or she could accept a plea 
agreement providing for a 4year sentence 
the woman chose immediate incarceration in lieu of a trial 
because halvorson was free on bond and she feared being attacked 
again said assistant county attorney kevin johnson 
she knew he would be going straight to prison and wouldnt be 
eligible for parole for three years johnson said tuesday 
halvorson was accused of breaking into the womans house through 
a kitchen window in the early morning hours of june 16 according to 
a criminal complaint the noise awoke the woman and she went to 
investigate a man dragged her from the kitchen to the bedroom 
covered her head with a blanket and raped her he fell asleep after 
the attack and the woman ran to a neighbors house to telephone 
police johnson said 
because halvorson was caught in the womans home authorities 
said his conviction was almost certain 
halvorsons attorney earl gray said halvorson was drunk out 
of his mind at the time 
halvorson had recently been convicted of drunken driving for a 
fourth time and had received a delayed jail sentence two days before 
the rape authorities said 
the woman was haunted by the thought of a second attack and had 
moved in with family members her home of 30 years put on sale said 
cindy clarkson a sexual assault counselor who worked with the 
victim 
she was feeling pretty powerless clarkson said what the 
judge did was wonderful just wonderful she just couldnt believe 
that someone in the system like a judge would take the time to 
listen to her and actually give her a choice 
posten said he allowed the woman to choose the sentence because 
of her age the viciousness of the assault and the court delays 
im not advocating that the victims decide the penalty but i 
thought it was the fairest thing to do in this case the judge 
told the woman you tell me what you want me to do and ill do 
it 
after announcing her decision she said wasnt that 
something 
i knew it could be months before thered be a trial she told 
the minneapolis star tribune the only thing i wanted to know is 
if he would be in jail during that time 
posten said he has allowed victims to help decide criminals 
sentences in only a few cases 
somebody that is raped early in the morning and its a little 
lady thats a greatgrandmother all this had an effect posten 
said it was the way the whole thing developed the delays were 
part of it too

defense minister rupert scholz says 
shortrange us nuclear missiles in west germany must be modernized 
despite improving eastwest relations a magazine reported today 
another government official speaking to the associated press on 
the condition of anonymity said he knew scholz gave the interview 
to the munichbase bunte magazine but could not confirm it contents 
but the official said modernization means total replacement of 
the lance nuclear missiles 
the official added that the north atlantic treaty organization 
has made no final decision for the weapons system in late 1987 
us and soviet officials agreed to scrap all their 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles 
in the magazine interview scholz was quoted as saying that a 
total elimination of shortrange missiles was out of the question 
he was quoted as saying he would rather have peace without any 
weapons but i am a realist we need a minimum of nuclear 
deterrance to be secure against a surprise conventional attack with 
tanks and aircraft 
his comments come as the bonn government struggles to satisfy a 
population that has increasingly warmed to soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachevs ideas on arms control 
the united states has been urging west germany to agree to the 
modernization of the aging lance nuclear missiles but has met with 
public resistance and a reluctance of officials in the bonn 
government to take a firm stand on the issue 
scholz was quoted as making his comments when he asked if 
modernization of the usbuilt lance weapons would be a campaign 
issue in federal elections next year 
you are talking about shortrange nuclear weapons there is no 
way to indefinitely get around modernization of these weapons he 
was quoted by bunte as saying 
a third zerooption in addition to that of the medium and 
longerrange missiles cant be considered scholz was quoted as 
saying of the lance missiles 
the zero option calls for the elimination of a category of 
nuclear missiles on both sides such as that provided for under the 
ussoviet intermediaterange missile treaty treaty signed in 
december 1987 
there are 88 lance missiles in west germany faced off against 
1365 modern sovietbuilt shortrange missile systems 
the lance missiles have a range of 75 miles compared to the 
soviet missiles with a range of 180 miles modernization of the 
lance rockets would entail making them faster or even lengthening 
their range 
a replacement system would probably have a range of 240 miles 
still considered shortrange the west german government official 
told the ap 
but there would also probably be a lesser number of missiles in 
the new system say 50 or so if the soviets also agree to cut 
theirs to the same number the official said 
western officials say that even with gorbachevs promise in 
december to slash soviet conventional forces by 500000 troops and 
50000 tanks the warsaw pact will still outnumber north atlantic 
treaty forces by two to one 
a copy of the bunte interview which will appear in the 
magazines thursday edition was provided early to other news media

arrested on suspicion of taking sports bets of up to 20 apiece from 
teachers and students police said 
vice officers arrested charles hammond 54 at john h francis 
polytechnic high school in the suburban san fernando valley on 
friday for investigation of bookmaking capt rick dinse said 
tuesday hammond was freed on 500 bail 
police said hammond took bets on professional sporting events 
the wagers were placed on school grounds during lunch breaks and 
after school police said 
bookmaking records were seized on campus and in his home where 
officers also found cocaine paraphernalia and a small amount of 
marijuana dinse said 
the records we got from him are quite extensive said lt 
brad merritt but so far we have no indications there was anybody 
else involved 
he was accepting wagers and making money off of them merritt 
said he was involved in all sports so whatever sport was in 
season he would accept wagers 
school officials said hammond has been transferred to a 
nonteaching position 
teachers found guilty of gambling on school grounds or gambling 
with students are subject to discipline ranging from a letter of 
reprimand to dismissal said ada treiger an attorney for the school 
district 
hammonds attorney donald wager said the teacher had only made 
a few bets with friends and never with students he has not 
engaged in any betting activity that is not common with the vice 
officers or other officers or kids wager said 
police said they had not determined exactly how much money was 
involved

the air force cant find the flight data 
recorder from a nuclear test missile and the pentagon says the 
soviets may have snatched the device from where it splashed down in 
the western pacific ocean 
the recorder was aboard a minuteman 2 missile testfired from 
california at kwajalein atoll in the marshall islands on july 7 
1987 according to army maj bill oconnell a spokesman for the 
defense department 
the story was first reported tuesday by the cbs evening news and 
later confirmed by the pentagon 
the flight data recorder was part of the dummy warhead on the 
missile which did not carry any nuclear weapons on its launch from 
california the air force periodically tests missiles by launching 
them from california at kwajalein 5000 miles away 
it is unlikely that the soviets recovered it the recorder in 
the hours between splashdown and the first search but that 
possibility cannot be ruled out said oconnell 
gennady i gerasimov the soviet foreign ministry spokesman said 
at a news briefing in moscow that he had heard news reports of the 
incident and i checked with our central information agency 
they said they couldnt find anything in the lost and found 
he quipped 
the minuteman is one of the main components of americas 
landbased nuclear missile force 
oconnell said the recorder has failed to turn up in five 
searches of the area where the missile splashed down 
the recorder would contain valuable information about the 
performance of the minuteman 2 missile it was not classified 
oconnell noted but its recovery would be useful to our missile 
testing efforts 
there are many possibilities that might account for the loss 
including accidents during the handling of the recovered debris 
poor record keeping and problems in shipping he said none of 
these possibilities has been ruled out and the investigation is 
continuing 
but he did confirm that soviet personnel may have landed on 
kwajalein which is supposed to be uninhabited 
us officials found vodka bottles cigarettes bug spray and a 
few technical items of soviet manufacture that could not have 
floated ashore and would have been unlikely to have been left ashore 
purposefully he said 
cbs said a soviet trawler was about 50 miles away during the 
splashdown and a soviet minisubmarine may have been used to snatch 
the warheads flight recorder 
oconnell refused to say if a soviet sub had been detected in the 
area there have been a number of reports of soviet submarine 
sightings and these reports are not being ignored he said i 
cannot however confirm that there was soviet submarine activity in 
or near kwajalein 
the test shot came nine months after the soviets ended a fishing 
agreement with kiribiati the island nation next to the marshalls 
oconnell noted if the fishing agreement had still been in effect 
the soviets would have had support capabilities to try to take the 
payload by sub he said but in july 1987 the soviet fishing fleet 
only had access to vanuatu over 2000 miles from kwajalein 
oconnell said the pentagon objects strongly to any clandestine 
soviet landings in the marshall islands that may have occurred he 
called such incursions illegal and a clear infringement of the 
sovereignty of the marshall islands in addition to being a 
challenge to the security of the us testing programs

big bird a great blue heron has turned vivianna 
biesens goldfish pond into a snack bar 
over the past two weeks the usually shy creature has shamelessly 
reduced the population in the 25foot pond where she and her 
husband have raised goldfish for 20 years from 100 fish to 60 she 
said 
what does big bird think that pond is midget sound she 
said the bird comes for breakfast lunch dinner and inbetween 
snacks 
if the fish he plucks from the pond are too big he flips them 
on gravel near the pond she said the others one gulp and they 
are gone 
she spread rakes brooms 2by4 boards and shelves across the 
pond but they only provided better perches for the heron to 
gobble fish she said 
as urban problems go this one is pretty unusual said debbie 
booker a state wildlife department administrative assistant we 
gets calls about starlings between walls squirrels in attics 
raccoons eating cat food in outside dishes coyotes invading 
neighborhoods but blue heron problems are rare 
at the agencys suggestion biesen spread chicken wire over the 
pond but big bird simply walked on the wire and continued its 
forays through the mesh finally last week she lowered the water 
in the pond to 2 feet from 3 feet 
the fish may have to swim sideways but i havent seen that big 
bird catch any of them yet she said he comes back regularly 
and walks the wire but he apparently cant reach the fish 
biesen said she isnt sure what shell try next if big bird gets 
to the fish again 
killing a blue heron carries up to a 500 fine and 90 days in 
jail said john gillespie the state agencys assistant enforcement 
chief 
wildlife officials have suggested loud music gunfire or a net 
canopy of the sort used to halt poaching at fish hatcheries as 
alternatives

a lawyer for alleged child killer joel steinberg 
charged that hedda nussbaum is a malingerer and a fraud who 
has stayed at a psychiatric facility to avoid being tried for lisa 
steinbergs death 
defense lawyer ira london said ms nussbaums stay at a 
psychiatric institution is part of the packaging of her by her 
lawyer barry scheck 
we feel shes avoided prosecution by hiding in a mental 
institution london said of the prosecutions chief witness 
steinberg 47 a disbarred lawyer is charged in the 1987 death 
of his illegally adopted 6yearold daughter who was taken from the 
greenwich village apartment he shared with ms nussbaum and died 
three days later 
ms nussbaum his longtime companion was arrested along with 
steinberg but charges were dropped after prosecutors concluded she 
had been abused by steinberg and was in no physical or emotional 
shape to harm or help the child 
she testified for the prosecution 
meanwhile steinberg agreed to be examined by prosecution 
psychiatrists later today sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said tuesday but the sources said there was no guarantee 
he wouldnt back out at the last minute 
the question of steinbergs mental state at the time of the 
childs death and whether he would present an insanity defense has 
become a key issue in the trial 
london on tuesday attacked ms nussbaums credibility as he told 
state supreme court justice harold rothwax why he should permit 
testimony by a psychiatrist who interviewed ms nussbaum at a 
hospital shortly after the girls death 
her condition for the past year is a fraud london told 
rothwax and it is part of her packaging the lawyer told the 
judge that whether ms nussbaum is a malingerer is a credibility 
issue the jury should look at 
london said the psychiatrist would testify that ms nussbaum 
has not needed that kind of treatment for the past year 
the judge granted londons request to allow the testimony 
the attorney refused to say whether steinberg would submit to the 
psychiatric examination today the deadline set by the judge the 
trial is to resume thursday 
results of a prosecution psychiatric examination would be 
presented to the jury only if the judge concludes that steinbergs 
attorneys are in effect presenting an insanity defense through the 
testimony of their witnesses 
rothwax set the deadline for the examination after indicating 
that he might rule later that an informal insanity defense was being 
pursued 
if steinberg refuses to be examined by a prosecution 
psychiatrist and the judge concludes that his lawyers are indeed 
presenting an insanity defense the jurors will be told about his 
refusal to be examined

a former navy enlisted man tried to sell 
submarine warfare secrets to the soviets because he had been 
discharged for indecent exposure according to authorities who said 
no damaging information was passed along 
craig d kunkle 39 was arrested tuesday at a williamsburg motel 
as he tried to turn over classified documents to two undercover fbi 
agents posing as soviet officials said irvin b wells iii head of 
the fbis norfolk office 
kunkle a former chief petty officer was charged with attempting 
to deliver classified information to a foreign government if 
convicted he could be sentenced to life in prison 
kunkle of virginia beach was discharged from the navy in 1985 
as nonjudicial punishment for acts of indecent exposure committed 
at the barbers point naval air station in hawaii according to an 
fbi affidavit 
a navy spokesman in washington said it was against policy to 
describe the circumstances of the discharge kunkle had an 
excellent record during his service lt cmdr craig quigley 
said 
beginning early last month kunkle talked six times with an fbi 
undercover agent whom he believed to be a representative of the 
soviet embassy in washington the affidavit said 
during each of these conversations kunkle discussed various 
aspects of his military background and experience and his desire to 
sell classified united states navy military secrets to the soviet 
union for monetary gain and as revenge for his discharge from the 
united states navy the affidavit said 
it did not specify how much money kunkle is alleged to have 
expected for the documents 
the court papers said kunkle was a specialist who installed 
submarine monitoring equipment on navy aircraft he served in the 
north atlantic indian and western pacific oceans and gained 
security clearance in 1984 when he was designated an antisubmarine 
warfare supervisor 
he was working alone in his attempts to sell the information to 
the soviets said wells 
kunkles wife suzanne a kunkle is enlisted in the navy we 
are interviewing her but theres no indication of any involvement 
on her behalf wells said 
kunkle was first identified by counterintelligence surveillance 
of telephone calls to the soviet embassy in washington said a 
source who spoke on condition of anonymity us counterintelligence 
agencies routinely monitor telephone calls to the embassy in an 
effort to prevent spying 
the case is unrelated to the norfolkarea spy ring led by former 
navy sailor john walker who is serving a life sentence for selling 
valuable navy secrets to the soviets fbi spokesman charles w 
steinmetz said 
the affidavit said that on dec 9 kunkle mailed a packet of 
documents photographs diagrams and related information to the 
undercover fbi agent at an alexandria post office box 
kunkle told the agent his intention was to demonstrate the type 
of classified information he was capable of providing to the soviet 
union then and in future contacts the affidavit said 
the navy determined on dec 14 that the information was 
classified as secret and could harm national security if released to 
the soviet union the court papers said 
weve prevented the soviet union from receiving this highly 
sensitive information wells said 
at a court appearance kunkle said he made about 260 a week as a 
security guard at portsmouth general hospital and worked as a 
parttime investigator for ccp pinkerton investigative services 
dick rafferty assistant administrator at portsmouth general 
said kunkle has worked for the hospital for three months and was 
placed on unpaid leave pending the outcome of the case 
kunkle worked for pinkerton for five to six months last year 
said paul santana pinkertons southeast virginia district manager 
he said kunkle was a security supervisor who traveled from client to 
client making sure that pinkerton uniformed security guards were 
doing their jobs properly he said kunkle had a good record with the 
company 
us magistrate tommy e miller ordered kunkle jailed pending a 
preliminary hearing thursday and granted his request for a 
courtappointed attorney 
verlon newman a friend of kunkle said he felt angry and 
betrayed by the arrest he described kunkle as a typical

parliament today enacted two key laws 
giving citizens the right to demonstrate and to join political 
parties other than the communist party the sole legal party in 
hungary since it took power in 1948 
the new law on association however only grants political 
parties and new independent movements the right to exist a separate 
law to be passed later this year will regulate the registration and 
operation of political parties according to officials 
only then will two fledgling political parties and the dozens of 
independent political groups formed in recent months be able to 
field candidates for parliament and for local councils 
the longawaited laws on assembly and assocation were passed with 
an overwhelming majority in parliament a day after advocates of 
greater pluralism clashed with more orthodox communists over the 
pace of reform 
of the 387 deputies in communistruled hungary only six opposed 
the law on association and just seven voted against the law on 
assembly 
the debate on the two laws which pitted reformers against 
communist party conservatives was overshadowed by the announcement 
tuesday that the withdrawal of soviet troops from hungarian 
territory would begin soon 
defense minister ferenc karpati said the withdrawal of an armored 
division an air force battalion and several air force units could 
be completed soon possibly before the end of the year 
communist party leader karoly grosz was quoted by hungarian media 
as having told a japanese newspaper that withdrawal was only a 
matter of weeks away 
karpatis remarks came as parliament adopted by an overwhelming 
majority a constitutional amendments including one that will 
facilitate the introduction of an alternative civilian service for 
conscientious objectors 
justice minister kalman kulcsar told the legislature the bills 
adopted today laid down the fundamental rights of citizens to 
assemble and to form associations including political parties the 
house however did pass a measure banning demonstrations outside 
parliament 
janos berecz the communist partys leading ideologist who is 
also a deputy called on independent groups that have mushroomed in 
hungary in the past year to help create cohesion and unity on 
the road to socialism saying pluralism within the current oneparty 
system was sufficient

accommodations air fare per diem payment rental of a 
fourwheeldrive vehicle extra telephone lines and facsimile and 
reproduction machines during the 10 days

estimated the cost at 65000 including a charter airplane hotel

and others the trip was to have included a stopover at the jan 2

personal expenses 
he never asked for a specific amount the spokesman said 
the rnc came up with 25000 fahrenkopf told the post that 
approval by the rnc budget committee came on dec 15 and was termed

who is the transition liaison between the quayle operation and that 
of presidentelect bush approached the rnc to aid quayle

tickets hotel and food bills were paid from their personal funds 
said beckwith 
quayle was paid 89500 as a senator and will receive 115000 as

the supreme court reviving a north carolina 
lawsuit today lengthened the time union members have to sue their 
unions over alleged freespeech violations 
by an 81 vote the justices ruled that such lawsuits do not have 
to be filed within six months of a disputed incident the deadline 
imposed by the national labor relations act for unfair labor 
practice complaints 
instead the court said the deadline for freespeech lawsuits 
filed under the labormanagement reporting and disclosure act is to 
be the same as the deadline for general personal injury lawsuits in 
that same state 
the decision reversed lower court rulings that a charlotte nc 
man had waited too long before suing his union 
the appeals court said the man missed the sixmonth deadline but 
todays ruling made clear that a threeyear deadline should have 
been imposed 
the lawsuit against the united transportation union by gp reed 
a public transit employee in charlotte and parttime 
secretarytreasurer for the unions local 1715 was filed within two 
years after the dispute arose 
reed sued his union in 1985 after he was ordered to repay the 
local 1200 he previously had reimbursed himself for time lost 
from his fulltime employment 
reed alleges that the denial of his reimbursement amounted to 
harassment for expressing his views on union matters 
one section of the law he sued under protects union members 
right to voice disagreement with union policies and allows members 
to sue over alleged violations of that right but in passing the 
law congress did not specify what the deadline should be 
writing for the court today justice william j brennan said 
reeds suit is more like a freespeech suit against some government 
official than an unfair labor practice complaint 
the sixmonth statute of limitations for unfair labor practice 
complaints was not adopted with the distinct federal interest 
in the free speech of union members in mind brennan said 
justice byron r white was the sole dissenter he said a 
sixmonth deadline should apply 
the case is reed vs united transportation union 871031

sponsors of a law to compensate 
japaneseamericans who were forced to live in internment camps 
during world war ii say it would take 60 years to make reparations 
under the spending plan proposed by president reagan 
but a spokeswoman for the white house budget office said today 
the 20 million earmarked for the first year is considered adequate 
unless congress appropriates the authorized maximum amount 
many of the eligible recipients may die before receiving their token 
compensation sen spark matsunaga dhawaii said tuesday 
matsunaga and the other lawmakers who sponsored the 1988 law said 
they would press the house and senate budget committees to vastly 
increase the 20 million in the presidents 1990 budget for the 
reparations 
up to 500 million can be appropriated in any single year until 
12 billion has been paid out 
no payments have been made under the law which promises 20000 
each to an estimated 60000 survivors of internment camps where 
americans of japanese ancestry were forced to live from 1942 to 1946 
matsunaga called the reagan proposal woefully inadquate and 
expressed hope the new congress will be sympathetic to our 
request 
the senator said some of the survivors are in their 80s and 90s 
and have been waiting more than 40 years for the apology and token 
compensation provided by the 1988 act the law requires the oldest 
survivors be paid first 
barbara clay spokeswoman for the office of management and 
budget said the amount is adequate for the first year of the 
payments 
the key issue is how fast the justice department can can spend 
this money she said they must pay off the oldest people first 
so they cannot pay out the money until they find out who the oldest 
people are from the administrations standpoint we believe 20 
million is a reasonable amount for the first year of this program 
for justice to meet the intent of the law 
the sponsors said at reagans spending rate it would take 60 
years to complete the payments although the law has a 10year 
deadline to complete the payments 
rep norm mineta dcalif said that only 1000 individuals 
would be compensated under reagans firstyear spending proposal 
and asked why has the presidents vision narrowed now why did he 
not remain committed to fight for the full 500 million funding to 
honor his commitment and our nations ideal 
i ask presidentelect bush how much longer must they wait 
the justice department is well ahead of expected schedules in 
locating recipients said rep robert matsui dcalif there is 
no reason to delay the process now we are talking about a majority 
of elderly citizens who may not be here in 5 or 10 years much less 
60 years 
the legislation provided apologies as well as the 20000 
taxfree payments 
reagan said last year the legislation ended a sad chapter in 
american history in a way that reaffirms americas commitment to the 
preservation of liberty and justice for all 
more than 120000 japaneseamericans were sent to internment 
camps because the government believed they were security risks 
in addition to benefiting japaneseamerican internees the 
legislation authorizes payments of up to 12000 for surviving 
members of the aleut indian tribes who were removed from the 
aleutian islands during the japanese attack on those islands in 1942 
it was early in 1942 when president franklin d roosevelt signed 
an order that said the war department could designate military areas 
from which people could be excluded 
later military orders resulted in the exclusion of all people of 
japanese ancestry from california washington and oregon and some 
in hawaii the orders affected 77000 us citizens and 43000 legal 
and illegal resident aliens all were taken to the camps

the supreme court overturned a military censors 
ruling and allowed publication of a news story criticizing the 
director of israels mossad intelligence agency and saying he will 
soon be replaced 
the courts decision tuesday widely reported in israeli 
newspapers marked the first time a court had ever overruled the 
military censors who have broad discretion over publication of news 
items in israel 
the disputed story in a weekly tel aviv newspaper hair did not 
give the name of the mossad head which is never made public 
it indicated the man was responsible for several of the mossads 
recent failures such as the discovery in west germany of false 
passports used by agents and events leading to the expulsion of 
agents from britain last year 
the report to be published in fridays edition of hair said 
the director will be replaced in a matter of days 
the director was the first to have risen from within the agencys 
ranks israel radio said there are two candidates likely to succeed 
him including one mossad official and one senior personality 
from outside the organization 
the new appointment must be approved by prime minister yitzhak 
shamir and finance minister shimon peres the heads of israels two 
main political blocs 
in overruling censorship on the story the supreme court said the 
press had a right to criticize public officials 
the court upheld censorship of any description of the mossad 
chief however citing the mans personal safety 
under israeli law military censors are empowered to ban 
publication of any news items deemed harmful to state security

the pilot of a boeing 737 was questioned again 
today by investigators trying to determine why his planes 
apparently undamaged right engine was shut down long before the jet 
crashed while the burning left engine remained in operation 
the civil aviation authority said it would order steppedup 
inspections of engines on three types of airplanes as a result of 
the crash sunday of the british midland airways jetliner 
the new inspections will apply to boeing 737400s the type of 
aircraft involved the crash as well as boeing 737300s and airbus 
a320s which have similar engines the authority said in a statement 
the statement came after the transport department recommended 
more frequent inspections of boeing 737 engines a communique issued 
by the departments air accidents investigation branch said it was 
still looking into the possibility that both engines might have 
suffered a related failure 
it did not refer to suggestions in the british media that the 
pilot shut down the wrong engine when a fire alarm went off 
the reasons for shutting down the engine are not yet clear and 
are still under investigation the comunique said 
the pilot capt kevin hunt whose back and legs were broken in 
the crash was interviewed for 45 minutes at leicester royal 
infirmary said the hospitals deputy general manager carol 
henshall hunt answered preliminary questions tuesday 
the jet plunged into an embankment a halfmile short of the 
runway at east midlands airport in central england where it was 
trying to make an emergency landing fortyfour people died and 82 
were injured 
transport secretary paul channon said hunt had reported a fire in 
the right engine of the new boeing 737400 shortly after it took off 
from londons heathrow airport for belfast 
channon told the house of commons tuesday that investigators 
found evidence of fire in the left engine but no evidence of fire 
or mechanical damage in the right engine 
britains tabloid newspapers concluded today that hunt had 
mistakenly shut down the right engine believing it was on fire 
instead of the left engine 
fatal error said the daily star pilot shut off the wrong 
engine said the sun error on the flight deck said today 
the british airline pilots association called the newspaper 
reports outrageous and without a shred of evidence aviation 
experts said it was highly unlikely the pilot could have confused 
the two engines given the cockpit layout and the system of 
doublechecks between pilot and copilot 
mrs henshall said that after hunts meeting with investigators 
he is obviously a lot happier that they have all the relevant 
facts 
she said some of the wilder headlines had been kept from the 
pilot but he had been made aware by friends and colleagues of the 
news reports 
asked if hunt had denied them mrs henshall said that is a 
comment i couldnt make 
the plane took off at 752 pm government sources speaking on 
condition of anonymity said hunt reported at 806 pm i have an 
engine on fire then at 814 pm the sources said he told 
traffic control i am shutting down the starboard right engine 
the plane crashed 12 minutes later at 826 pm 
channon refused tuesday to speculate on what happened saying he 
wouldnt rule out anything including pilot error or sabotage though 
he said i dont think sabotage is very likely 
william tench retired head of britains air accidents 
investigation branch put the odds against a doubleengine failure 
at 10 millionto1 
group captain john tritton of the guild of air pilots said i 
find it unbelievable that the pilot identified the wrong engine on 
fire because the checks are done so carefully by both pilots 
asked if the warning system itself could go wrong capt john 
guntrip also a guild member said it is possible it has been 
known in the past there have very occasionally been false fire 
warnings on aircraft 
aviation experts say the investigation into the fire in the left 
engine will focus on the possibility of a broken turbine blade 
mechanical failure contaminated fuel problems in the fuel feed 
system faulty maintenance and an explosion in the engines 
combustion chamber 
the plane broke into three main sections recovery crews prepared 
today to remove the crumpled center section including the two wings 
and two engines from the embankment beside englands main 
northsouth m1 highway about 100 miles north of london 
the cockpit tail section and black boxes which record 
cockpit flight data and conversations have already been taken to the 
government air accidents investigation branch at farnborough 
outside london

a senior israeli general has resigned after 
complaining that efforts to put down the palestininan uprising in 
the occupied territories could damage the moral character of 
soldiers a newspaper reported today 
also today the army chief of staff lt gen dan shomron was 
quoted as saying troops can never quell the rebellion because it is 
a political struggle 
the reports are likely to increase the debate among israelis over 
the armys role in combating the 13month uprising in the west bank 
and gaza strip 
five more palestinians were wounded in the uprising today and 
three palestinians were indicted in the firebombing of an israeli 
passenger bus 
the masscirculation daily maariv reported that maj gen 
menachem einan was leaving his job as the armys logistics chief 
over concern about the impact of the uprising on israeli soldiers 
i am very worried about the level of morality of israel 
soldiers in the territories einan was quoted as saying we are 
making them face provocations that inspire maliciousness all too 
quickly 
an army spokesman said on condition of anonymity that einan would 
step down friday to take a civilian job however the spokesman who 
demanded anonymity said the resignation had nothing to do with the 
reported criticism 
the military command refused to allow the associated press to 
interview einan and made no immediate statement on the report 
in the interview with maariv einan traced his worries to the 
governments handling of its 1982 lebanon invasion which turned 
into a threeyear war instead of the planned limited campaign he 
said the result showed him the military should sometimes question 
what political leaders are saying 
my big lesson is that perhaps there are times when the fighting 
military echelons cannot accept to the last letter the instructions 
given by political echelons he said 
in another report the jerusalem post said shomron told a 
closeddoor session of parliaments defense and foreign affairs 
committee on tuesday that the army was limited in its ability to 
break up the intefadeh the arabic word used for the uprising 
there is no such thing as eradicating the intefadeh because in 
essence it expressed the struggle of nationalism the paper quoted 
him as saying 
israeli newspapers said today the army indicted three 
palestinians on murder charges for throwing three firebombs at an 
israeli passenger bus oct 30 in the west bank city of jericho five 
israelis a soldier a mother and her three small children died 
in the attack 
a total of 15 israelis have been killed as a result of the 
uprising in the territories israel took from arab neighbors in the 
1967 middle east war at least 349 palestinians have been killed 
most by army gunfire 
israeli troops today shot and wounded five young palestinians in 
clashes in the gaza strip refugee camps of nusseirat and khan yunis 
and the west bank village of ein abush arab doctors said among the 
wounded was a 12yearold shot in the left thigh the army said it 
was checking the reports

money for specific strategic weapons such as 
the mx and midgetman missiles and the star wars program should be 
pooled to force the white house and congress to make tough spending 
choices over the next decade the chairman of the house armed 
services committee said today 
rep les aspin dwis said his proposal would allow the 
republican administration and the democraticcontrolled congress to 
bridge serious differences on defense spending policy and build a 
strategic consensus 
we can expect only a flat defense budget and the strategic 
program of the reagan administration simply wont fit something has 
to be done and confrontation isnt likely to accomplish it aspin 
said in a speech to the national press club 
he said approximately 31 billion a year should be made available 
for all strategic weapons with none of it earmarked for any 
specific weapon 
under the 10year plan money would be pooled for the strategic 
defense initiative commonly known as star wars the b52 b1b and 
b2 stealth bombers and the trident mx and midgetman missiles 
the annual budget for the pool would remain constant at about the 
31 billion level the total budget for the strategic programs in 
1989 with adjustments for inflation aspin said 
he said spending for weapons systems usually begins slowly 
increases midway through production and tails off at the end the 
program would permit tradeoffs in which more money could be spent on 
a weapons system in the middle of production aspin said 
the question is no longer merely eitheror it is also sooner 
or later he said 
the program would force congress and the new administration under 
presidentelect bush to decide what specific weapon systems should 
be purchased and deployed and which should be delayed the committee 
chairman suggested 
this great pot of strategic programs and funding im proposing 
would also expand enormously the range of alternatives at the 
disposal of policymakers aspin said right now these issues 
are arbitrarily straightjacketed 
for example aspin and other democrats in congress have favored 
the truckmobile singlewarhead midgetman missile while the reagan 
administration has proposed scrapping the weapon 
aspin said his plan would let research and development funding 
for the midgetman begin in fiscal 1990 with possible depoloyment in 
1995 
to compensate for moving forward on the midgetman aspin 
suggested slowing down stealth bomber purchases for two years and 
limiting spending on star wars to its current annual level of 4 
billion through 1996 
now is the time for democrats and republicans white house and 
congress to put all the weapon systems into the pot take a long 
10year view work the tradeoffs and build a strategic consensus 
aspin said

president ranasinghe premadasa said 
today that the 5year state of emergency will be lifted at 
midnight providing for the release of hundreds of political 
prisoners a government spokesman said 
premadasa who took office nine days ago had promised to end the 
emergency in an effort to chart a more peaceful course for this 
indian ocean island nation ravaged by ethnic violence since 1983 
a military official however said security forces will retain 
the power to arrest and detain suspects without charge for up to 90 
days and search houses without warrants under an antiterrorism law 
adopted four years before the state of emergency the official 
cannot be identified under briefing rules 
the state of emergency has been extended on a monthbymonth 
basis since may 1983 premadasa had already vowed it would not be 
renewed on its next expiration date sunday 
but today he told his cabinet the emergency would be lifted three 
days early according to festus perera minister of information and 
spokesman for the cabinet 
the state of emergency empowered security forces to arrest and 
detain people without charge dispose of bodies without inquests and 
search houses without warrants 
on tuesday premadasa told top government officials we have 
lived under emergency regulations for now more than five years i 
feel that is enough time for everybody 
about the time the announcement was made a small bomb exploded 
in a market in central colombo injuring two people police said 
they did not know whether the bombing was related to the ethnic or 
political strife or stemmed from a private dispute 
sri lanka famed for its beaches and gemstones fell into a 
vicious cycle of violence in 1983 as extremists from the tamil 
minority launched an insurgency seeking autonomy from the sinhalese 
majority 
more than 8500 people mostly sinhalese have since died in 
massacres ambushes and guerrilla battles the dead include more 
than 600 indian soldiers part of a peacekeeping force sent to sri 
lanka at the governments invitation in july 1987 to try to disarm 
tamil insurgents 
in his campaign for president premadasa pledged to press for 
withdrawal of the 50000 indian troops a few thousand were reported 
to be pulled out earlier this month 
in addition more than 650 government supporters mostly 
sinhalese have been killed by sinhalese extremists who opposed 
former president junius r jayewardenes efforts to make peace with 
the tamils by granting them some autonomy in northern and eastern 
sri lanka 
jayewardene who initiated the state of emergency had governed 
sri lanka since 1977 the constitution barred him from seeking a 
third term 
premadasa prime minister under jayewardene won the dec 19 
presidential election and was sworn in jan 2 
within five days 574 political prisoners who had been held 
without charge under the emergency were freed about 1800 more 
political prisoners were still being held but premadasa said all 
would be freed as quickly as possible

the phoenix gazette on testing airport security with fake bombs 
congratulations the note said you have found our phony 
bomb we are tf1 the largest television network in france and it 
is with due respect and great pleasure that we found your 
company to be keen and consistent with security matters 
authorities at the freight offices of three airlines at kennedy 
international airport where the fake bombs were found were not 
amused french television reporter alain chaillou and his american 
producer bruce frankel were arrested after they delivered their 
makebelieve bombs 
certainly there have been more sophisticated gestures by the 
media for the sake of a story but probing the integrity of security 
is certainly a benevolent undertaking 
there are risks of course alain chaillou and bruce frankel are 
charged with falsifying an incident a federal offense and face 
prison sentences if found guilty but the benefits of their crude 
charade quickly became apparent as air france announced that 
because of the incident the airline would inspect every cargo 
shipment 
alain chaillou and bruce frankel did what journalists are 
supposed to do serve the truth fearlessly

the westerly ri sun on the safety of older airplanes 
ever since a passenger plane flying in hawaii lost a chunk of its 
fuselage we have been hearing a lot about steppedup inspection of 
aged aircraft 
when an eastern airlines boeing 727 sprang a leak and lost cabin 
pressure at 31000 feet the other day that was just one further 
sharp reminder that the problem demands even more attention 
the program begun by the federal aviation administration is 
laudable but it still needs tightening the programs deficiencies 
are symbolized in the two aforementioned episodes 
a crack in one plane has just been detected but the system 
missed the flaw that caused an emergency landing in charleston 
wva when cabin air suddenly wooshed out through a hole in the 
roof 
that kind of discrepancy tends to make travelers nervous and 
rightly so

carlsbad nm currentargus on illiteracy 
an estimated 23 million people in this country cannot read books 
or newspapers they cannot read street signs restaurant menus job 
applications or welfare forms nor can they understand a bus or 
subway schedule 
an additional 35 million are functional illiterates which means 
they can read just well enough to scrape by 
last april congress approved a 50 millionayear program to 
deal with the national disgrace of illiteracy but given the federal 
governments fiscal constraints the states counties and cities 
will bear the major responsibility for dealing with this problem 
stemming the rising incidence of illiteracy will require a 
substantial investment of time and money but the costs of failing 
to do so are much higher

st louis postdispatch on abortion rights 
the supreme court has decided to review missouris law regulating 
abortions 
that wont necessarily lead to a reconsideration of roe vs wade 
the 1973 court decision legalizing abortion nationwide but neither 
is it a decision that people concerned with protecting privacy and 
reproductive rights can welcome 
should for example abortions be performed in public hospitals 
the missouri law forbids this a decision by the 8th us circuit 
court of appeals last july struck that provision down 
can a state require doctors to perform viability tests for 
fetuses when the pregnancy is beyond its 19th week missouri law 
requires this in another provision the appeals court ruled against 
what is the consequence of a state declaring that the life of 
each human being begins at conception missouri declares this in 
yet another provision thrown out by the appeals court 
the missouri case is an important measure of the supreme courts 
respect for womens hardwon rights to privacy and reproductive 
freedom they are rights that all americans should hope the 
supreme court will continue to hold in esteem

los angeles herald examiner on emperor hirohitos funeral 
who attends emperor hirohitos upcoming funeral may be as 
important a symbol to some japanese as the monarchs 
longanticipated death 
new zealand and australia two countries where memories of the 
brutal japanese army have not yet faded are debating whether to 
send any prominent officials at all 
the japanese government undoubtedly will be scrutinizing the list 
of other attendees hoping to gauge the countrys international 
acceptance as a peaceloving economic superpower 
photographs of mourners overcome with grief outside the imperial 
palace make many westerners wonder how one man could garner and 
retain such respect 
after all hirohitos 62year reign included a catastrophic war 
and the declaration that he was not a god incarnate and he had 
little to do with the most dynamic economic recovery in japanese 
history

battle creek mich enquirer on poverty in america 
president lyndon johnson declared war in his first state of the 
union message a war on poverty it will not be a short or easy 
struggle he predicted on jan 8 1964 
twentyfive years later americans are better off but battles 
still need to be fought for select groups 
the poverty level was 135 percent in 1986 which translates to 
325 million americans living in poverty since 1964 the lowest 
nationwide poverty rate was 111 percent in 1973 which climbed to 
14 percent by 1983 
in 1986 the poverty rate was 105 percent for whites however 
rates were 331 percent for blacks and 282 percent for hispanics 
 
in terms of age the highest poverty rates are among young 
families 
if presidentelect george bush adheres to the 1988 republican 
platform no new major federal antipoverty programs appear likely 
so if the war is to continue local and state efforts need to focus 
on 
encouraging our youth to get the education they need to stay out 
of the poverty cycle 
better training of minorities and women for jobs in the local 
work force 
voluntary or mandatory action to get quality day care so single 
parents can get available jobs

the daily oklahoman oklahoma city on oliver north 
the governments case against oliver north is slowly crumbling 
away and thats neither surprising nor lamentable 
after nine months of costly legal preparations for trial of the 
former white house aide independent counsel lawrence walsh has 
asked for dismissal of the two charges that were central to the 
prosecution 
he had little choice but to drop the conspiracy and theft counts 
because of the reagan administrations refusal to release classified 
material a judge said north needs to get a fair trial 
with the heart of this case gone walsh should now move to drop 
the remaining 12 charges and put an end to this fruitless endeavor

the palm beach fla post on oliver north 
independent counsel lawrence welch saying he was concerned that 
government secrets were at risk asked the federal court to withdraw 
two main charges against col oliver north 
the sensitivity of the evidence is something the public will have 
to accept on the word of walsh who had promised to put up a 
fight for it 
if a former president or even a sitting president can give 
evidence that could help a defendant he should be made to do so 
a constitutional case can be made for executive immunity when the 
issue is between the executive and congress but a president should 
not be above the law when a citizens freedom is at stake

dismiss conspiracy and theft charges against former white house aide 
oliver north probably 
was justice served by the move probably not 
the move to dismiss conspiracy and theft charges against north 
adds yet another troubling conflict in the irancontra affair 
the american people are simply left with no choice but to trust 
the judgment of those keeping the classified information they are 
left no choice but to accept walshs decision about what charges he 
can most effectively prosecute 
but north still would face 12 other charges those charges should

the democratic governors association called a news conference in 
los angeles jan 4 to urge congress to approve nationwide uniform 
poll closing 
the democratic party may be as bad off as some observers 
suggested its governors who should be providing some party 
leadership are hung up on network predictions in presidential 
races 
they imply that these projections are decreasing voter 
participation by convincing supporters of projected losers that they 
have no reason to vote but novembers race produced nothing to 
support that idea 
their complaint really boils down to the lack of suspense in the 
past couple of presidential races for voters on the west coast 
that doesnt call for legislation that would inconvenience much 
of the rest of the nation suspense will return to the presidential 
race when the democrats deliver a candidate who can avoid being 
buried in an electoral landslide

herald and review decatur ill on nuclear waste 
nuclear plants had a record year in 1988 they provided a full 20 
percent of the nations electricity but another report should 
give the rest of us pause 
in the same week the nonprofit research organization public 
citizen said 1987 was a dismal year for nuclear power industry 
in 1987 the private agency said there were at least 492 
violations of safety regulations at us nuclear power plants 
moreover there were nearly 3000 mishaps 430 emergency 
shutdowns and 104000 incidents in which workers were exposed to 
measurable doses of radiation 
the gravest problems facing mankind today involve pollution and 
the environment despite mandates from the federal government that 
every state establish hazardous waste sites and lowlevel nuclear 
waste storage sites no one wants such facilities in their back 
yard 
in the past we tended to assume we would solve the questions of 
what to do with radioactive waste and spent materials up the 
road now that road appears to be a dead end its possible 
theres no place on earth to put this stuff safely

portland maine press herald on federal pay raises 
president reagan has endorsed a proposal by an independent salary 
commission to increase substantially the pay rates of members of 
congress and other federal employees under current law the salary 
hikes will take effect unless congress specifically votes against 
them 
congress would be doing itself and the country a big favor by 
going along with the proposal 
it will take courage because there has been substantial public 
criticism of the plan which calls for a whopping 50 percent 
increase in congressional pay from 89500 to 135000 
as part of the pay package senators and representatives would 
have to give up the odious practice of accepting outside honorariums 
from special interest groups for speeches and other approaches 
accepting a pay increase even a big one under these 
conditions is defensible continuing the practice of accepting 
outside payments from special interest groups is not

the duluth minn newstribune on federal pay raises 
silence from this carping corner as congress moved inexorably 
toward a 50 percent pay hike for itself may have seemed tacit 
acceptance of its wisdom or inevitability 
perish the thought we think the idea stinks 
election to congress is a public service those who opt for such 
service shouldnt have to sell the family silverware to do so but 
they shouldnt expect to get even moderately rich while doing so if 
135000 a year isnt moderately rich itll do til the real thing 
arrives 
sure its costly to live in washington but the thousands of 
district of columbia residents not at the top of the federal pay 
scale manage to do it on a lot less than 135000 a year 
washington is costly just look at your 1988 taxes on the form 
youll fill out soon to pay for that profligacy 
but before you do why not send a message to congress until they 
do a 50 percent better job their employers have decided not to 
grant them a 50 percent pay hike

philadelphia inquirer on cambodia 
ten years ago this month the vietnamese army marched into phnom 
penh putting an end to the rule of the notorious khmer rouge 
regime which had killed one million kampucheans cambodians in its 
warped attempt to create a communist arcadia 
this year squeezed by its soviet backers hanoi has pledged to 
pull its troops out of kampuchea cambodia by the end of 1989 
but without the presence of vietnamese troops wellarmed khmer 
rouge guerrillas could eventually march back into phnom penh 
the united states is in a position to prevent such a disaster 
but it cant do it alone 
the united states should pressure china to stop sending arms to 
the khmer rouge something the chinese at last seem willing to do 
the united states should also encourage all the key players to 
agree to a formula for an interim government headed by prince 
sihanouk hopefully as a prelude to free elections 
here the united states could use a promise of improved relations 
with vietnam complete with economic aid as a carrot to get hanoi 
to cooperate

a tax break for brown university 
professors that dates back to the days of king george iii is being 
phased out but still gives 32 faculty members a discount on their 
property taxes officials said 
the ivy league school has been phasing out the break which 
applies to the first 10000 of the assessed value of a professors 
home since 1966 brown acted because of complaints that the tax 
break costs the city money and is unfair 
all newly hired or promoted professors since then have been 
required to forgo their right to the exemption 
every year there are a few less said city tax assessor 
theodore littler 
joyce mk lewis tax assessor in the suburb of barrington said 
the exemption dates to the universitys charter issued by king 
george in 1764 
originally brown tenured professors were exempt from all 
property taxes but the university and the legislature narrowed the 
exemption during the civil war lewis said 
when the university started phasing out the tax break 23 years 
ago 135 professors took advantage of it 90 of whom lived in 
providence 
last year the exemption for 25 city residents cost the city 
5971 said ancelin lynch university associate director for 
government and community relations that works out to about 240 per 
professor 
the school has 390 tenured professors as of last year

the commander of the un observers 
appointed to monitor the withdrawal of cuban troops from angola said 
today he is satisfied he will be able to conduct an independent 
verification of the departure 
south africa and unita guerrillas fighting the angolan government 
have expressed doubt that an independent verification will be 
possible 
i think there will be no difficulties in carrying this 
assignment out gen pericles ferreira gomes of brazil told 
reporters when asked about the ability of the 70 military and 20 
civilian observers to verify the numbers of departing cuban troops 
but he also said the success of the 27month mission depended on 
the good will of the angolan and cuban governments who agreed 
to the phased withdrawal dec 22 and who are to supply the precise 
numbers of cuban troops when the monitoring procedure officially 
begins april 1 south africa and unita leaders have questioned the 
wisdom of relying on such figures 
cuba first sent troops to angola in july 1975 to support members 
of the angolan popular liberation movement mpla who were fighting 
south african and usbacked unita guerrillas for control of the 
portuguese colony that was to become independent in november of that 
year 
unita or the national union for the total independence of 
angola whose guerrillas number an estimated 25000 is not party to 
the agreement signed by angola cuba and south africa the group 
claims it is continuing attacks on angolan forces in the south of 
the country 
on tuesday a symbolic contingent of 450 cuban troops departed by 
plane for havana they reportedly were followed today by about 1000 
more troops on a soviet ship 
under the terms of the usbrokered agreement 3000 cuban 
troops are to have left this southern african nation by april 1 
ferreira gomes said he had been informed all 3000 would be gone by 
sunday 
he declined to give figures on departures through today saying 
it was up to the the angolans and cubans to make the figures public 
ferreira gomes said under the terms of the agreement designed to 
bring independence to the south african controlled territory of 
namibia both cuban troops and arms were to be sent back to cuba 
he said 50000 was the basic figure for the number of cuban 
troops to be withdrawn but he added angolan and cuban officials 
were to furnish exact figures on cuban troops in angola once the 
un observer mission is officially established april 1 when the 
entire team is to have arrived in the country 
he said the monitoring procedure of the unarmed observer force 
will consist of checking the number of troops departing from four 
ports and one airport against lists furnished by the cubans and 
angolans 
the general said the angolan government is committed to providing 
transport when needed to the un observers who have the mandate to 
travel anywhere in the country 
road travel is difficult if not impossible in most of angola 
because of land mines and the presence of unita guerrillas 
the angolan government has requested un assistance to defray 
the estimated 800 million cost of the cuban withdrawal the un 
security council recently approved a 204 million budget for the 
observer mission through mid1991 
the members of the observer mission are algeria congo india 
jordan norway spain yugoslavia czechoslovakia brazil and

sen lloyd bentsen chairman of the senate 
finance committee indicated today that congress will leave intact 
the tax increase on older americans that pays for new protecting 
them against costs of catastrophic illness 
we might have some oversight hearings but they would be more 
to publicize details of the program than to determine how the tax 
should be changed bentsen said at a news conference 
the texas democrat acknowledged receiving a lot of letters 
protesting the new tax but he said the mail shows a lot of people 
dont know details of the bill and there is a great deal of 
misinformation on that legislation 
scores of house members are cosponsoring signed bills to repeal 
or modify the new tax 
bentsen said much of the outcry is coming from wealthy retired 
people who want more of the costs of catastrophic care financed by 
taxpayers in general 
on another topic bentsen said he expects congress to crack down 
on leveraged buyouts of corporations he offered no details 
although one likely method would be to curtail the interest 
deduction allowed on money borrowed to finance certain takeovers 
i want to make sure the cure is not worse than the situation we 
are facing now bentsen said his committee and the house ways and 
means committee already have scheduled hearings on the issue 
the former vice presidential candidate expressed hope that 
presidentelect george bush will make substantial changes in the 
budget that president reagan submitted monday he said the 50 
percent pay raise and mail allowances reagan recommended for 
congress were excessive 
even with the new tax on the elderly bentsen said the 
catastrophic protection is the best buy in town theres nothing 
in the private sector that offers what it offers at those prices 
the catastrophic bill was enacted last year to protect 
medicareeligible elderly americans against costs of an illness that 
could wreck them financially the program is estimated to cost about 
33 billion over five years 
most of the cost will be paid by a surtax on several million 
elderly people whose incomes are high enough that they pay a tax on 
part of their social security benefits this would hit only those 
who pay at least 150 a year in income taxes congressional aides 
say this exempts a typical couple with income under 11000 
the surtax for 1989 is 15 percent of the income tax paid with a 
maximum of 800 per individual or 1600 for a couple if both 
spouses are eligible for medicare the surtax will jump to 25 
percent next year and then rise by up to one percentage point a year 
the premium for part b medicare coverage for doctors services 
has been raised to 3110 a month to help pay for the 
catastrophiccare program

a federal judge began final instructions to the 
jury this morning in the trial of two teamsters officials charged in 
a 700000 payrollpadding scheme that allegedly involved the late 
union boss jackie presser 
harold friedman and anthony hughes were accused of racketeering 
and embezzlement in the 2monthold trial presser president of 
the 16 million member union also was charged in the case but died 
in july at age 60 
the jury received instructions from us district judge george w 
white before they were to begin deliberations the trial opened oct 
24 and included testimony from some 80 witnesses 
the government said hughes 52 was a ghost employee at 
bakery workers local 19 which is affiliated with teamsters local 
507 here dozens of grocers and bakers testified for the government 
that they had no contact with hughes 
much of tuesdays closing arguments concerned pressers actions 
from the early 1970s through 1981 when hughes and three other men 
allegedly were paid a combined 700000 from union dues without 
working 
the defense would have you believe all this was jackie 
pressers responsibility prosecutor stephen jigger said 
poor powerless harold friedman living in the fear of jackie 
presser i submit to you that the evidence in this case indicates 
not only what jackie presser did but also what harold friedman and 
anthony hughes did 
friedman 66 a teamsters international vice president and ohios 
most powerful teamster testified that presser had unquestioned 
power at local 507 where he served as secretarytreasurer while he 
was international president 
the evidence demonstrates abuse of union office by harold 
friedman anthony hughes and jackie presser for the benefit of their 
friends and cronies jigger said 
the defense said it was presser who hired john a jack nardi 
jr the son of a dead reputed organized crime figure george argie 
an admitted past operator of an illegal gambling operation and 
allen friedman who is no relation to harold friedman each 
testified for the prosecution that they were paid and did little 
work if any 
the defense said allen friedman often was too ill to work 
harold friedman was accused of two counts each of labor 
racketeering embezzlement and filing false reports with the labor 
department hughes was charged with two counts of labor racketeering 
and one of embezzlement 
defendant friedmans attorney paul cambria said his client put 
in long hours of work for his members and that his participation in 
a scheme to embezzle members money just doesnt make any sense 
i ask you not to be misled cambria said you must 
determine whether my client was a thief jackie presser is gone 
whether it had a lot to do with him or not is another story my 
client is on trial not jackie presser 
john r climaco pressers former attorney has said that 
pressers defense would have been that the fbi authorized him to 
hire the ghost employees to enhance and protect his status as an 
fbi informant 
but prosecutors contend presser couldnt have been authorized to 
hire ghost employees because they were working as early as 1972 
and presser didnt become an fbi informant until 1977 harold 
friedmans attorney said last week that presser was a government 
informant in 1963 
the trial culminated the us justice department and the 
department of labors sixyear effort to uncover wrongdoing in the 
cleveland power base of presser who rose to the presidency of the 
nations largest union in 1983 and held the job until his death 
presser was the fourth of the last five teamsters presidents to 
be indicted he inherited the job from roy williams when williams 
was sent to prison for conspiring to bribe a us senator

bill boxes outfitted with combination 
locks to foil wouldbe thieves at the new legislative office 
building work so well they even keep out their owners 
we need a safecracker complained one legislative official 
the supervisor of the bill room ought to be bank robber willie 
sutton 
the 697 boxes which cost about 10000 are stuffed daily with 
legislative bills schedules and records the documents are 
essential for keeping track of legislation and other developments at 
the capitol 
the boxes replaced an older system in which bills were stuffed 
in pigeon holes assigned to news organizations lobbyists and other 
groups there were no locks and doors and sometimes material was 
taken 
since this is the first session the boxes are being used theyre 
probably a little tight and more difficult to open said david 
b ogle executive director of the legislative management committee 
people will get used to them

university of oklahoma officials have purged 
library computers of a virus that ruined several students papers 
and shut down terminals and printers in a student computer lab 
the library also has set up extra computers at its computer lab 
entrance to inspect students programs for viruses before they are 
used on other computers said bizzell memorial library manager 
donald hudson 
a computer virus is a program that once inside a computer 
duplicates itself a virus can tell computers to put a message on a 
screen or shut down at a certain time or just replicate itself until 
the computer overloads 
the librarys virus probably got into a computer through a 
students disk but the student may not have known the virus was 
there hudson said the librarys computers are not linked to any 
computer offcampus 
the computers used in the student lab are connected through 
printers which allowed the virus to spread hudson said

a plan to revive steam train passenger service to 
the grand canyon has won tentative approval from the national park 
service provided its operators can show that it will reduce 
automobile traffic 
grand canyon railway announced tuesday that it plans to establish 
service over the 64 miles between grand canyon village on the south 
rim and williams a town of 2400 people near flagstaff 
the line was built in 1901 but passenger service was halted in 
1968 
the company also hopes to build a hotel and old west theme park 
at williams said robert roth grand canyon railway president and 
chief operating officer 
roth noted that others had failed in their attempts to resume the 
steam train service but said his company had obtained the necessary 
permits and financing 
we own all the properties involved our investors money is in 
the bank and this ones for real he said 
the park service says it supports restoration of train service 
because it might help reduce automobile traffic at grand canyon 
national park which had 39 million visitors in 1988 
its fair to say the park service has given them tacit approval 
providing that it can be demonstrated there will be reduction in 
automobile congestion park spokesman chuck lundy said

george washington delivered his farewell 
address to a philadelphia newspaper lyndon johnson and gerald ford 
delivered theirs to congress and ronald reagan is turning to the 
medium of which he is most the master television 
reagans swan song as president will be delivered at 9 pm est 
tonight from the oval office and will be carried by the networks 
asked today for a preview of his speech reagan told reporters 
im just trying tonight to have a conversation with the american 
people 
the white house press office said the address expected to last 
about 20 minutes would be the 43rd television speech of reagans 
presidency 
we expect it to be a very personal kind of look at what 
president reagan tried to do and what he sees as his 
accomplishments and the problems ahead white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said tuesday 
it will be an opportunity for him to talk directly to the 
american people as he has done so often in the last eight years 
indeed he has 
it was through this forum that the president 
helped generate the steam to push his tax cuts through congress 
sprang his star wars plan for a spacebased defense against 
missiles 
mourned the death of the challenger space pioneers 
defended his decisions in the irancontra affair 
kenneth duberstein the white house chief of staff said this 
morning on nbcs today program the speech is intended to be a 
personal conversation that the president really wants to have with 
the american public 
duberstein predicted the address would include a little bit of 
nostalgia pointing to the accomplishments pointing to some of the 
vision that ronald reagan brought to the oval office and to the 
presidency in 1981 and some vision that he has for continuing the 
reagan revolution 
i think youre going to hear some anecdotes and some stories 
but youre going to hear ronald reagan talking about how 
fundamentally america has been changed the world has been 
changed duberstein said 
and i think you may see some advice for the american people in 
the years to come that may be a little bit different than you may 
have anticipated 
the former radio announcer movie actor and afterdinner speaker 
came to the white house with more televisionrelated experience than 
any of his predecessors his 1964 television speech for barry 
goldwater helped catapult reagan into two terms as governor of 
california where he continued to sharpen his television skills as 
well as gaining experience in government 
in his first major televised speech from the oval office he 
outlined his tax reduction program on july 27 1981 using charts 
and a pointer to make his case that the administration plan was more 
fair than that proposed by democrats in congress he ended as he 
would so often thank you god bless you and good night 
but his statement from the oval office on nov 13 1986 that the 
arms sent to iran could easily fit into a single cargo plane and 
did not constitute a swap of arms for hostages failed to go over in 
congress reagan later had to admit mistakes had been made 
sometimes he had surprises up his sleeve his speech on march 23 
1983 announcing that he was ordering a study of what came to be 
known as the strategic defense initiative or star wars was news to 
many of his key advisers 
his speech on the challenger explosion on jan 28 1986 was one 
of his shortest only 11 paragraphs and is often cited as an 
example of reagan at his most eloquent speaking only a few hours 
after the disaster he told the families of the crew members they 
wished to serve and they did and added nothing ends here our 
hopes and our journeys continue 
tonights speech is likely to be short on news but it follows a 
tradition of farewell addresses that has been followed by many 
previous presidents from george washington to jimmy carter 
washingtons farewell address attacked the spirit of party 
and warned against foreign entanglements washington released it to 
one newspaper the american daily advertiser and papers throughout 
the new nation quickly picked it up it has become a classic 
american text that is still read annually in congress on 
washingtons birthday 
the most celebrated presidential address of the television era is 
dwight eisenhowers on jan 17 1961 in which the old general 
warned in the councils of government we must guard against the 
acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by 
the militaryindustrial complex 
johnson and ford both former congressional leaders chose to 
make their final speeches in the form of state of the union 
addresses to congress as some other presidents have done 
carter spoke from the oval office on jan 14 1981 six days 
before reagan took over the democrat promised reagan his support 
to the very limits of conscience and conviction and warned of 
the need to reduce the horrifying danger of nuclear arms 
stockpiles 
fitzwater said reagan spent several hours this week working on 
his speech 
if it is like most presidential speeches he will also have had 
some help from the speechwriting office but then thats nothing 
new according to washington biographer james thomas flexner the 
nations first president worked from a draft by his secretary of the 
treasury alexander hamilton

president reagan said today the plight of 
american hostages in lebanon has never been out of his mind since 
they were seized but he declined to speculate on whether they might 
be released as he leaves office 
i can only pray and continue what weve been doing reagan 
told reporters in response to a question weve been exploring 
every channel possible for their release and theyve never been out 
of my mind since they were so unfairly seized 
the president was then asked if there might be a repeat of what 
happened in 1981 when american hostages held in iran were released 
on inauguration day 
i wont hazard any speculation on that he said its just 
its a great tragedy we hope that it can be resolved

faced with repeated political defeats angry 
motorists and insurance rates averaging more than 1000 a car gov 
thomas h kean said it may be time to abolish new jerseys nofault 
auto insurance system 
if we cant have real nofault it is time to admit the system 
doesnt work and close it down shoot it and put us out of our 
misery kean said in his state of the state message tuesday 
kean has said before it may be time to abolish the 16yearold 
system arguing that rates will continue to rise if lawmakers do not 
pass his proposal to place strict limits on lawsuits but he has 
never said it so combatively or in such a prominent forum 
kean spokesman john samerjan said wednesday that the governor 
made the statement out of frustration with lawmakers and has not 
been working on a formal proposal to abolish the system 
more than 20 states have nofault insurance under which the 
medical bills of accident victims are paid regardless of who was at 
fault said leonard karp a spokesman for the state department of 
insurance 
for six years the legislature has refused to limit lawsuits to 
only the most seriously injured lobbyists for the legal profession 
contend such limits will strip victims of their right to sue in 
exchange for a savings of only 100 per car 
auto insurance rates in new jersey are among the highest in the 
nation 
the joint underwriting association a statebacked agency created 
under the kean administration in 1983 to cover drivers unable to 
purchase coverage in the private market is staggering under a 
deficit of more than 25 billion 
to keep the jua afloat all of the states more than 4 million 
drivers pay an average of 220 per car in annual surcharges 
a series of reforms took effect jan 1 to contain rising rates by 
increasing deductibles requiring accident victims to pay part of 
their medical costs and imposing a fee schedule on how much doctors 
may charge 
the reforms also allow drivers to limit their right to sue in 
exchange for lower premiums but kean has said such an option is 
inadequate 
i was shocked its like he was looking for something dramatic 
to round out his speech said michael m rossi iii president of 
the independent insurance agents of new jersey we just went 
through a long arduous task of legislative wheeling and dealing and 
now were seeing the beginning of that law he has to give the law a 
chance to work

congress wants to make one of its best perks 
even better for the 1990 election year by budgeting a record 114 
million for official mailings 
the figure is included in president reagans proposed budget but 
congress actually draws up its own spending proposal 
it is normal for congress to about double its mailing costs in 
election years even though campaign materials cannot be sent with 
taxpayer money 
for fiscal 1989 congress has budgeted 609 million according 
to budget documents in the election year of 1988 however 
congressional mailings cost 1133 million a figure highlighted in 
a report on congressional perks by consumer advocate ralph nader 
nader opposes reagans recommendation that members of congress 
receive 135000 in annual pay instead of the current 89500 
the raise will become law unless both houses of congress defeat 
the plan by feb 8 and house leaders are dropping hints they have 
no plans to schedule a vote by then 
in addition to having taxpayers pay for their official mail 
lawmakers receive orange bag service from the postal service 
ensuring oneday delivery 
other fringe benefits are less costly but provide the 535 
members of congress a life without some of the hassles that face 
ordinary citizens 
parking for instance 
special tags permit lawmakers to use any curbside in the district 
of columbia except along fire hydrants fire stations or loading 
docks 
at national and dulles airports members can use special lots 
next to the terminals 
lawmakers can stay fit by using using the gym in the rayburn 
house office building and exercise rooms in the russell and dirksen 
senate office buildings facilities include a swimming pool 
handball volleyball and basketball courts and a steam room 
should a member become ill at work or need an immunization or 
allergy shot he or she can go to the attending physicians service 
in the capitol it is staffed with doctors nurses and technicians 
and includes such services as a medical response team an ambulance 
laboratory xray and pharmacy services free medical testing is 
available at the senate health club 
members can participate in federal employee health insurance 
programs and life insurance of 78000 is provided with taxpayers 
picking up half the cost and members paying for the other half 
lawmakers have approved tax deductions for many groups of 
americans and have included a special one for themselves a 
deduction of 3000 per year for living expenses while away from 
their congressional districts or home states 
if a lawmaker discusses legislative business with anyone who is 
not a staffer or a fellow member of congress he can be reimbursed 
for the cost of food and beverage 
while lawmakers cant depend on job security those who stay 
awhile can live comfortably on their pensions 
some former members have received over 1 million in pension 
benefits and dozens of others are approaching the milliondollar 
mark according to naders report 
lawmakers can invest up to 10 percent of their base pay in a 401 
k pension plan a program available to many americans in which 
no tax is paid until money is withdrawn 
but for members of congress taxpayers match the first 5 percent 
of salary a contribution that currently is worth 4475 a year per 
member if the pay raise goes through the taxpayer share would 
total 6750 
covered by social security and if they choose the civil 
service retirement programs members can receive pension benefits 
at age 50 after 20 years of service or age 60 after 10 years of 
service 
reports filed by congressional committees and other reports show 
travel expenditures of 67 million during the 1987 calendar year 
money that comes from the state department budget

parliament passed two historic laws 
wednesday giving citizens of this communist country the rights to 
demonstrate and form associations including independent political 
parties 
the action followed months of debate on bringing a multiparty 
system to hungary where the communist party has been the only legal 
political organization since taking power in 1948 
on tuesday the government accepted a proposal from the legal 
committee to present another law regulating operations of new 
political parties by aug 1 rather than next year as originally 
intended 
until it is passed two fledgling political parties and dozens of 
independent political groups formed in recent months cannot enter 
candidates in parliamentary or local council elections 
speeding action could make competitive multiparty elections 
possible in 1990 when the current parliaments fiveyear term 
expires a new constitution also is to be proclaimed next year 
voters were given a choice of candidates in the 1985 
parliamentary elections but they were carefully screened 
threequarters of the deputies in the current parliament are 
communist party members 
only six of the 387 deputies voted against the law on 
associations and 24 abstained seven opposed the law on assembly 
which sets rules for demonstrations and rallies and 16 abstained 
the associations law gives requirements for organizing and 
registering independent groups and in effect allows retroactive 
legalization of those already formed 
some deputies urged the government in tuesdays debate to abandon 
the separate law regulating political parties contending 
associations and groups should be governed by the same standard 
more orthodox communist legislators said this would lead to 
anarchy and parties shouild not even be formed until the law 
regulating them was passed 
after the session justice minister kalman kulcsar told reporters 
the aug 1 date was a middle ground a compromise in the interest 
of the whole 
until recent efforts for political reform began hungarys 
parliament often merely validated actions of the communist party 
leadership state tv began live broadcasts of some sessions in 
september however and deputies have become more outspoken 
gyoergy boecsey chairman of the legal committee said setting a 
date for the party law was sufficient guarantee of a future 
multiparty system 
the law on assembly gives guidelines for holding demonstrations 
and public rallies and declares holding them to be a fundamental 
right it provides sentences of up to three years in jail for those 
attempting to interfere with that right 
magyar hirlap the governent newspaper carried comment from some 
of the new organizations 
zoltan biro of the hungarian democratic forum the independent 
group claiming the largest membership was quoted as saying it is 
of primary importance that selforganization take place in a legal 
framework and urging adoption of the political party law as soon 
as possible 
an unsigned statement attributed to the alliance of free 
democrats said the right of free formation of political parties 
belongs to the right of association indicating opposition to a 
separate party law 
an independent youth movement the federation of young democrats 
called original versions of the laws undemocratic and 
overregulated and said the final versions guaranteed some basic 
human rights

the supreme court today handed state officials 
and consumers a big victory ruling that two pennsylvania utilities 
may not recover from electricity customers the costs of four 
abandoned nuclear power plants 
the justices said states have broad power to set rates that 
balance the interests of utility investors and the public the 
constitution does not require that states allow utility companies to 
recover from their customers all prudent investment the 
justices said 
by an 81 vote the justices upheld a ruling that bars the 
pennsylvania companies from billing electricity customers for 50 
million invested in the abandoned plants 
chief justice william h rehnquist writing for the court said 
the constitution within broad limits leaves the states free to 
decide what ratesetting methodology best meets their needs in 
balancing the interests of the utility and the public 
rehnquist rejected arguments that pennsylvania regulators 
unconstitutionally confiscated the utilities property when they 
overturned a previously approved rate increase to cover the costs of 
the abandoned plants 
the court upheld a provision of pennsylvania law that instructed 
utility regulators on how to set rates 
it cannot seriously be contended that the constitution prevents 
state legislatures from giving specific instructions to their 
utility commissions rehnquist said 
he said states have broad discretion over how they go about 
regulating utilities as long as the final result is a reasonable 
system 
an otherwise reasonable rate is not subject to constitutional 
attack by questioning the theoretical consistency of the method that 
produced it rehnquist said 
duquesne light co and pennsylvania power co said their property 
was confiscated without just compensation when they were barred from 
passing on to customers the cost of the abandoned plants 
state consumer advocate david barasch called the action a 
blockbuster decision 
he said about 50 million is involved for pennsylvania 
ratepayers but the significance in the long run is enormous the 
court reaffirmed the principle that there is no constitutional right 
to collect every penny on an investment if the investment is not in 
the public interest 
kenneth service a spokesman for duquesne said the company 
already instituted a refund program after the state supreme court 
overturned a commonwealth court ruling that upheld the state public 
utility commission 
from a financial perspective it doesnt greatly affect us 
because we had already taken a loss on those cancellations he 
said he estimated the loss at about 34 million 
duquesne and penn power in 1967 formed the central area power 
coordination group along with three ohio utilities ohio edison 
co cleveland electric illuminating co and toledo edison co 
the group planned to build and finance electricgenerating 
plants and in the early 1970s construction of four nuclear plants 
was authorized 
construction of the plants known as the davisbesse unit no 2 
and 3 and erie unit no 1 and 2 was canceled in 1980 after the arab 
oil embargo and the nuclear power accident at three mile island in 
pennsyvania in 1979 
the two utilities then sought to recover preconstruction costs 
associated with the plants by having their customers pay higher 
rates over a 10year period 
the pennsylvania public utilities commission in 1983 granted 
duquesne permission to collect 346 million a year for 10 years and 
said penn power could collect 956000 a year over the same period 
those allowances were included in a 105 million rate increase 
approved for duquesne and a 153 million rate hike for penn power 
but those rate increases were challenged successfully by the 
pennsylvania state office of the consumer advocate 
the pennsylvania supreme court overturned the rate hikes basing 
its decision on a new state law that barred utilities from including 
construction costs of generating facilities in their rate base until 
the facility is used and useful in service to the public 
the case is duquesne light vs barasch 871160

a 71yearold woman facing eviction from 
her ramshackle home in a state park ridiculed a suggestion that she 
be allowed to stay in new quarters as an honorary park ranger 
they want to make me a park ranger im laughing through my 
tears really said doris gagnon they must think i have a screw 
loose 
the department of environmental protection which is drafting 
plans to develop the park decided tuesday to initiate eviction 
proceedings after gagnon ignored a monday deadline for leaving the 
property officials said 
at the same time a letter from the eight republicans on the 
15member milford board of aldermen was sent to department 
commissioner leslie carothers proposing the compromise that would 
permit gagnon to remain 
i think everyone wants the park to move forward but i think it 
would be better to go in the direction of honoring doris she is 
sort of folklore in this city said frederick lisman the 
aldermens republican chairman 
wanda rickerby spokeswoman for the department said carothers 
would not respond until she had received the proposal 
gagnons home on long island sound was one of 100 that were 
demolished to make way for the park after losing a court battle to 
save her house in 1971 she established a series of ramshackle 
homesteads in the vicinity of her old property she has a small 
camper and shacks with no running water 
she said she expects to win millions of dollars in compensation 
when the showdown over her eviction reaches the courts 
the republican aldermen proposed the state build a small house 
for her in an outoftheway part of the park as honorary park 
ranger she would look after things lisman said 
to ask the taxpayers to again foot the bill is totally 
irresponsible said joseph castignoli the democratic leader on 
the board of aldermen no matter how small the house is its

further cuts in working hours are needed to give 
workaholic japanese more leisure time a government labor panel 
said wednesday 
the 22member advisory panel headed by former bank of japan gov 
haruo maekawa made the proposal in a report submitted to labor 
minister hyosuke niwa 
the average japanese worked 2150 hours in 1986 compared with 
1938 for the british 1924 for americans 1655 for west germans 
and 1643 for the french said masaaki haga a labor ministry 
official 
the japanese average edged up to 2168 hours in 1987 for which 
figures of other industrialized countries were not available haga 
said 
the panels report asked the government business and labor to 
work toward a fiveday work week many japanese companies still 
operate at least 5 days a week 
the panel also urged top business managers to lead the way in 
taking holidays to encourage employees to follow suit 
even when entitled to longer periods few japanese take more than 
a week or two of vacation a year many take no vacation or only a 
day or two 
the government began a campaign for fewer working hours several 
years ago as a way to increase personal consumption and the growth 
of service and other domestic industries japans trade partners 
have been urging it to rely less on exports and more on domestic 
sales to spur its economic growth 
in its first revision of the labor standards law in 40 years the 
government last year set a goal of shortening the legal work week to 
40 hours from 48 although no date was set for attaining the goal 
labor ministry officials say the work week will be shortened to 44 
hours by 1991 and to 40 by 1995 
in a move initiated by the post and telecommunications ministry 
last year the postal savings system banks and stock exchanges have 
agreed to eliminate saturday business starting in february 
banks and stock exchanges close on the second and third saturdays 
of each month

most of the worlds nations today condemned the use 
of chemical weapons and urged a speedy conclusion to negotiations in 
geneva on eliminating toxic arms from the face of the earth 
in a compromise between the united states and arab nations the 
final declaration did not explicitly link the control of nuclear and 
chemical weapons but referred to a 1978 united nations document that 
does so 
us delegates said they were pleased with the declaration which 
officials from 150 nations adopted by consensus after a fiveday 
meeting 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman said the 
administration was pleased with the outcome of the conference 
the us objectives for the conference were to focus worldwide 
attention on the problems of chemical weapons use and chemical 
weapons proliferation and help put a stop to the use of these 
weapons in violation of international law he said 
the document reaffirmed the 1925 geneva protocol prohibiting the 
use of chemical weapons and called for steppedup negotitions in 
geneva to ban the development production and storage of chemical 
arms it also urged giving the un secretarygeneral more power to 
investigate chemical weapons use 
the participating states solemnly affirm their commitments not 
to use chemical weapons and condemn such use they recall their 
serous concern at recent violations as established and condemned by 
the competent organs of the united nations the declaration said 
the participating states stress the necessity of concluding at 
an early date a convention on the prohibition of the development 
production stockpiling and use of all chemical weapons and on 
their destruction this convention shall be global and comprehensive 
and effectively verifiable 
arriving at a consensus required days of haggling and compromise 
us officials said that they got more than they expected 
were very pleased with a very substantive declaration that 
hits all the main points that the conference should have 
addressed said gary crocker a member of the us delegation 
the important thing is that we have the worlds attention focused 
on this serious problem 
the declaration which is not binding illustrates the common 
will of nations to condemn chemical weapons kalevi sorsa of 
finland chairman of the drafting committee told reporters after 
the meeting ended 
sorsa said obtaining a consensus required concessions and 
compromises from all sides but from here on we can refer back 
to the paris conference and its text 
the resolution reaffirms participating nations commitment to a 
geneva protocol that bans the use of chemical weapons but not their 
production and storage the protocol often has been ignored since it 
was signed 67 years ago 
arab delegates failed to persuade the meeting to implicitly 
condemn israels alleged nuclear capability foreign minister tariq 
aziz of iraq said he and his arab colleagues finally decided not to 
take a position that would prevent the success of the conference 
work on the declaration continued through tuesday night to 
reconcile deepseated differences between industrialized nations and 
arab states including the word nuclear became the main obstacle 
to consensus 
arab states wishing to retain the right to have chemical weapons 
to offset israels alleged nuclear force had asked that chemical 
disarmament be linked directly to nuclear disarmament a position 
opposed by the united states and the soviet union 
in the end the declaration excluded the word nuclear but 
referred to the final declaration of the 1978 un general assembly 
session devoted to disarmament that linked nuclear and chemical 
negotiations 
aziz complained that draft falls short of our concerns 
where there is one country that has nuclear weapons and that country 
that has mass destruction weapons is not a signatory to the 
nonproliferation treaty and has refused to reach peace that 
nation constitutes a real threat to the peace and security of the 
region 
both the superpowers have thousands of tons of chemical weapons 
in storage and the united states has a program to develop new 
sophisticated systems 
another 20 nations including many at the conference possess the 
weapons or are in the process of developing them

the nations mushrooming hispanic population 
needs increased education job training and welfare assistance to 
blend effectively into american society the authors of a new study 
said wednesday 
hispanics while growing by 34 percent to 20 million in this 
decade still lack an effective voice in society according to 
population researchers cary davis and rafael valdivieso 
policy makers need to find ways to ease the transition of latinos 
into american society including bringing them into the economic and 
political process valdivieso vice president of the 
washingtonbased hispanic policy development project said at a news 
conference 
in the past new arrivals in america have had available the 
springboard of lowskill jobs to help them get started in society 
commented davis of the private population reference bureau 
but us society is moving away from industrial and other jobs 
that often need little training with available employment often 
requiring higher education and skill levels davis said 
thus he explained the ladder of jobs climbed by past 
minority groups to make a place in society is being pulled from the 
grasp of hispanics 
national attention we think is required said davis in 
releasing a study written by the two men entitled us hispanics 
challenging issues for the 1990s it is published by the 
population reference bureau an independent research group 
hispanics will become the nations largest minority sometime in 
the next century outnumbering blacks if current population trends 
continue explained valdivieso 
and the fact that hispanics have a younger age structure than the 
rest of society means more of their numbers will be in the work 
force at a time when large numbers of other americans are retiring 
valdivieso said programs are needed to help keep hispanics in 
school and to provide them with job training and assistance in 
making the transition from school to the job market 
raising the minimum wage would be important especially for young 
couples who are parents said valdivieso and for the same group 
finding ways to provide medical assistance is a major consideration 
he said 
he called for more englishlanguage classes for immigrants while 
preserving bilingual public services more access to welfare 
programs efforts to reduce discrimination against hispanics 
programs to help hispanics become more active politically and 
increased corporate attention to latinos as consumers and employees

a new heart is needed by a 17yearold 
girl whose body is rejecting the heart of a friend that was 
transplanted into her after his unexpected death three years ago 
donna ashlock has been treated for 10 episodes of organ rejection 
since she received the heart of her classmate felipe garza jr her 
father said so her doctors are seeking a new donor for another 
transplant 
they had a new heart they were going to give her last thursday 
night but it didnt match ray ashlock said tuesday at their home 
in the central california farming town of patterson 
donnas case became famous because of the circumstances 
surrounding the heart that has been beating in her body since 
january 1986 
felipe a 15yearold who had a crush on donna knew she had a 
degenerative heart disease and wouldnt live much longer without a 
transplant 
although he had not been ill felipe told his parents farm 
workers he wanted his heart donated to her after his death a short 
time later on jan 4 1986 he died unexpectedly when a blood vessel 
burst in his brain 
as felipe wished his friend then 14 received his heart in an 
operation at pacific presbyterian medical center in san francisco 
pattersons city council named a park in the boys honor the family 
has since moved away from the community 
donna has had to return to the hospital 75 miles northwest of her 
home often since the operation for organ rejection treatment and 
checkups 
hospital spokeswoman nancy millhouse said it is fairly common for 
a body to reject a transplanted organ in 5 to 10 percent of the 
cases there is chronic rejection shes been through a lot and 
shes handled herself well 
ashlock said his medical insurance as a city employee didnt 
cover all the 500000 cost of donnas initial operation and bills 
for treatment and transportation have mounted since leaving him 
wondering if he can ever pay off all of daughters medical bills 
weve got some bills that are 35000 a whack ashlock said 
donna who turns 18 on april 1 is anxiously awaiting another 
heart 
i think ill be better off with a new one said the 
teenager who studies at home since her condition keeps her from 
attending regular classes at patterson high school she will 
graduate this spring if she can stay well enough to maintain her 
grades 
she hopes to go to college and become a nurse not because shes 
had so many nurses care for her but because i like helping people 
and stuff

about 150 central americans camped 
outside the immigration office early today hoping to get the 
documents they need to get out of southern texas before the 
government has another chance to keep them here 
hundreds of others were staying at shelters provided by churches 
including some the red cross has begun overseeing 
were here to keep a good place in line said jorge narvaez 
romero a 34yearold nicaraguan trying to get to los angeles where 
he has a cousin everybodys leaving the rio grande valley 
the exodus began monday when us district judge filemon vela 
issued a temporary restraining order blocking an immigration and 
naturalization service rule that went into effect last month the 
rule prevented immigrants seeking political asylum from traveling 
farther into the united states while their cases are being decided 
velas order was to last until thursday pending a full hearing 
on a classaction lawsuit against the ins but was extended when the 
hearing was postponed to jan 31 those camping outside the office 
said they wanted to make certain the ins attended to them before the 
hearing 
im trying to leave tomorrow said jairo ramon contreras 
martinez a 24yearold nicaraguan camped by the door and trying to 
make it to a cousins house in austin thank god for the kindness 
of the american people 
dolores muniz and other members of harlingens citizens 
committee for justice took blankets sweet potatoes beans rice 
noodles bread and tea to the men women and children huddled under 
blankets and sheets of black plastic at the ins center tuesday 
were all human beings mrs muniz said these people are 
freezing theyre starving 
virginia kice spokeswoman for the ins harlingen district said 
more than 800 people were in line when the door opened tuesday 
it was reminiscent of the last days of the amnesty program 
last year when some undocumented aliens received legal status under 
a landmark immigrationreform law ms kice said 
greyhound lines saw its normal northbound passenger loads triple 
by tuesday on the morning and afternoon buses from brownsville and 
harlingen a company spokesman said 
most of the people about 75 percent are going to miami 
said george gravley greyhound spokesman in dallas 
rep solomon ortiz dtexas said that if the right to travel 
continues the area still will need aid from the federal government 
to care for the thousands of central americans who will keep 
coming through the pipeline 
the judges temporary order restored the previous ins procedure 
allowing asylum seekers to travel from their point of entry to their 
us destinations to pursue their claims for refugee status under 
those regulations immigrants in the lower rio grande was supposed 
to voluntarily check in with the agency in harlingen 
ortiz joined a special justice department team that arrived 
tuesday to determine the immigrants needs 
what makes it a crisis is this is a very poor county and this 
county doesnt have the money or the infrastructure to provide the 
services ortiz said 
near brownsville on tuesday crews used bulldozers to remove 
debris from a makeshift campsite where more than 300 central 
americans began staying in improvised tents after the ins procedure 
took effect dec 16 
the immigrants were ordered off the property by tuesday afternoon 
and many took refuge in churches 
city commissioners voted tuesday night to demolish the condemned 
amber motel where about 150 central americans have been holed up in 
squalid conditions

vietnam will give more remains of americans 
missing in action to a us team arriving thursday and joint 
excavations of crash sites will be conducted a government official 
said 
i think there will be quite a number said nguyen can acting 
director of the vietnam office for mias referring to the remains 
i dont want to make it known yet because they have to be 
carefully identified 
can said in an interview with the associated press that vietnam 
had been trying its best to speed up the return of american remains 
from the vietnam war 
he said it is allowing us teams to roam the country 
interviewing witnesses and officials in regions where the planes are 
believed to have gone down the latest team will be in vietnam for 
about 10 days he said 
can denied again that there are any living american prisoners 
being held in vietnam and that hanoi was withholding mia remains and 
handing them over to the united states when it suited its political 
purposes 
even the us state department and pentagon offcials do not 
believe that there are any american prisoners in vietnam can 
said this they know for sure but because of the pressure from 
the rambo faction and the right wing in the united states they just 
say it cannot be asserted that there are or there are not living 
american prisoners in vietnam 
can said it would make no sense for vietnam to hold american 
prisoners or remains 
what good is it for us to keep one or two american prisoners 
he said what good is it for us to hold remains if we returned to 
the united states nearly 600 pows why should we keep the remains 
living prisoners of war are much more valuable if we choose to use 
them as leverage 
vietnam wants badly to establish diplomatic relations with the 
united states that would open the way for help for its faltering 
economy with financial aid and the lifting of an american trade 
embargo 
the united states has said vietnam first must withdraw all of its 
troops from cambodia which hanoi has promised to do no later than 
1990 
the united states insists the question of mias is a separate 
humanitarian issue but has told vietnam that its cooperation in 
returning american remains would be looked upon favorably 
on dec 15 vietnam turned over 38 sets of remains believed to be 
those of american servicemen it was the largest such repatriation 
since the vietnam war ended on april 30 1975 
since the end of the war vietnam has returned the remains of 172 
americans identified by the army 
there are still 2383 americans listed as missing in action 
including 1747 in vietnam 547 in laos 83 in cambodia and six in 
china 
it is unlikely that the united states and vietnam will be able to 
account for all of the mias due to the lapse in time and the jungle 
terrain where many of the airmen were lost 
can said part of the us team arriving thursday would operate in 
what was once the demilitarized zone that divided north and south 
vietnam during the war 
a joint team probably would excavate a crash site near the 
chinese border he said 
this will be the fourth joint effort to account for mias since 
the joint searches were begun in october each operation runs about 
10 days

medals to soviet human rights activists natan and avital sharansky 
wednesday saying they were given on behalf of all mankind not 
just all americans 
sharansky receiving the awards for himself and his absent wife 
at a ceremony in the oval office praised reagans efforts on behalf 
of human rights and urged presidentelect bush standing beside 
reagan to continue them 
the awards to the sharanskys were authorized by a law passed by 
congress on may 13 1986 for their work for human rights and 
freedom of soviet jewry 
this is in behalf of all mankind not just all americans 
because of what you have done and your courage over the years 
reagan said nine years of imprisonment on false charges and still 
retained your poise and your strength to do this 
sharansky told reagan that thousands and thousands of people in 
soviet camps are free today not because of some goodwill of 
soviet leaders but because of their struggle and your struggle 
and you presidentelect please think about those thousands 
and thousands who are still there and who are praying now for you 
and that you will be as stubborn as strong for defending human 
rights in the soviet union he told bush 
all of your record convinces us that you will continue the 
fantastically good record on human rights that president reagan 
had he said 
while talking to reporters in a white house driveway sharansky 
said that while he believes an international human rights conference 
in moscow in 1991 can be positive he is concerned that it 
could become the biggest public relations event in the history of 
soviet human rights

states have sweeping powers to protect 
consumers by barring utilities from passing on the costs of 
abandoned nuclear power plants the supreme court ruled wednesday 
the justices voting 81 barred two pennsylvania utilities from 
billing electricity customers for nearly 50 million invested in 
four abandoned plants 
the court said the constitution does not require states to allow 
utilities to recover from customers all prudent investments as 
long as utility investors get a reasonable rate of return on their 
investment their right not to have their property confiscated is 
not violated the court said 
in other action the court 
examined whether the death penalty is a valid punishment for 
mentally retarded murderers the justices heard arguments in the 
case of a 32yearold texas death row inmate with the mind of a 7 
year old 
lengthened the time union members have to sue their unions over 
alleged freespeech violations reviving a north carolina mans 
lawsuit against his union 
in the utility case chief justice william h rehnquist wrote for 
the court the constitution within broad limits leaves the states 
free to decide what ratesetting methodology best meets their needs 
in balancing the interests of the utility and the public 
the court upheld a provision of pennsylvania law that told 
utility regulators how to set rates 
it cannot seriously be contended that the constitution prevents 
state legislatures from giving specific instructions to their 
utility commissions rehnquist said 
the ruling was hailed by organizations representing state and 
local officials 
we are delighted its a terrific opinion said benna ruth 
solomon chief counsel to the state and local legal center here the 
organization represents the national governors association the 
us conference of mayors and other groups 
charles d gray a lawyer with the national association of 
regulatory utility commissioners said the ruling could apply to 
other utility rates as well such as those for gas and telephone 
service 
pennsylvania consumer advocate david barasch said the ruling 
means the ratepayer is not the deep pocket of last resort the 
ratepayer is not some sort of guarantor of every penny the industry 
decides to charge 
nuclear industry representatives said they were not sure how much 
money might be at stake nationwide the edison electric institute 
said settlements between state public utility officials and plant 
managers have been reached in the case of many abandoned plants 
rehnquist said states have broad discretion over how they go 
about regulating utilities as long as the final result is a 
reasonable system 
an otherwise reasonable rate is not subject to constitutional 
attack by questioning the theoretical consistency of the method that 
produced it rehnquist said 
the court ruled against duquesne light co and pennsylvania power 
co in 1967 they formed the central area power coordination group 
with three ohio utilities ohio edison co cleveland electric 
illuminating co and toledo edison co 
the group in the early 1970s made plans to build four plants 
known as the davisbesse unit no 2 and 3 and erie unit no 1 and 2 
but the work was abandoned in 1980 after the arab oil embargo and 
the nuclear power accident at three mile island in pennsylvania 
the two pennsylvania utilities then sought to recover 
preconstruction costs through higher rates to customers over a 
10year period they said plans for the facilities had been prudent 
since they were based on an expected demand that failed to 
materialize for unforeseen reasons 
the pennsylvania public utilities commission in 1983 granted 
duquesne permission to collect 346 million a year and penn power 
956000 a year for 10 years the charges were included in a 105 
million rate increase for duquesne and a 153 million hike for penn 
power 
the pennsylvania supreme court overturned the part of the 
increases aimed at covering the costs of the abandoned plants the 
increases had been challenged by the states consumer advocate 
the state court upheld a pennsylvania law barring utilities from 
including construction costs of generating facilities in their rate 
base until the facility is used and useful in service to the 
public 
rehnquist said wednesday that duquesne and penn power had still 
realized solid earnings 116 per cent and 12 percent respectively 
given these numbers the overall impact of the rate orders 
is not constitutionally objectionable rehnquist said no 
argument has been made that these slightly reduced rates jeopardized 
the financial integrity of the companies 
justice harry a blackmun dissented on narrow grounds he said 
the court should not have ruled in the case for procedural reasons

commissions from drilling companies which pass the charge on to 
pemex

mexicos oil industry if the government carried out threats to sell 
pemex operations to private investors

salinas who took office dec 1 has vowed to sell or close 
unprofitable state industries

october when the union revived charges that a leading governing 
party official mexico state gov mario ramon beteta embezzled

tenure the union lost control of millions of dollars worth of 
contracts

imparcial de oaxaca notimex reported partial shutdowns hit 
refineries in salamanca poza rica cadereyta and minatitlan 
late tuesday pemex claimed refinery operations were returning to 
normal todays incidents involve individuals and do not 
constitute any workeremployer conflict or attacks on the oil 
guild it said in a statement 
in ciudad madero traffic returned to normal after a blockade was 
lifted this morning by thousands of oil workers and sympathetic 
students who had cut highways leading into the twin cities of 
tampico and ciudad madero 
troops occupied the tampico airport and a refinery in ciudad 
madero according to tampico newspaper editor agustin jimenez 
stores many operated by the union were shut in ciudad madero 
while gasoline supplies ran out in tampico he said 
soldiers also occupied pemex installations in the northern border 
city of reynosa and in villahermosa capital of oilrich tabasco 
state 
pemex accounts for 40 percent of mexicos revenue and about half 
the federal budget it employs 180000 people mostly union members

a bronze statue of a wild boar at kansas 
city international airport has been fed dimes quarters and an 
occasional dollar bill from passersby but recently it reaped a 
real windfall 
a minneapolis couple made out checks for 500 and 250 and 
slipped them into a slot at the base of the boar i think its a 
worthy cause said clarence j haugh 
haugh wasnt referring to the boar contributions given to the 
beast and to another boar at kansas citys country club plaza 
are turned over to childrens mercy hospital 
miller nichols former chairman of the company that developed the 
country club plaza said he noticed one of the boar statues in a 
store window while strolling along a riverbank in florence italy 
in the late 1940s 
you know he said he remarked to his daughter thats a 
marvelous piece of sculpture but i dont know how i would use it 
he said the owner told them that the original wild boar statue 
was in the straw market of florence and that gifts made to the 
casting went to a childrens orphanage and so an idea was born 
nichols said he bought the statue for 2500 and placed it at the 
country club plaza years later he returned to florence and bought a 
second statue this one for 7500 to put at the airport 
the two statues produce about 7000 annually for the hospital 
half the money is given directly to the hospital and half goes into 
an endowment fund which totals more than 36000

blaming wealthy retirees for most of the 
complaints the chairman of the senate finance committee said 
wednesday he anticipates no changes in a new tax on older americans 
that pays for protection against costs of catastrophic illness 
theres a vocal minority sounding off about the tax sen 
lloyd bentsen dtexas told reporters adding that the outcry will 
subside once details of the program which took effect jan 1 are 
better known 
mail and phone calls are coming chiefly from wealthy people who 
want it cost of the catastrophic protection to be more heavily 
subsidized by taxpayers in general he said 
will the clamor lead to repeal or modification of the tax 
bentsen was asked i dont think thats going to happen he 
said recalling that similar complaints were heard when social 
security and medicare were enacted 
although dozens of members of congress have signed bills to 
repeal or change the tax rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of 
the house ways and means committee has taken a stand similar to 
bentsens 
although having congress two top taxwriters in support of a 
program is good insurance it was not enough to save another hotly 
debated tax law in 1983 lawmakers eventually bowed to a massive 
mail campaign promoted by the banking industry and repealed a 
yearold law that withheld taxes from some interest and dividend 
payments 
congress is hearing few complaints about the basic 
catastrophicprotection program which helps elderly and disabled 
americans who are eligible for medicare bear the cost of illnesses 
that otherwise would threaten their financial stability the 
complaints are directed at the method of financing the program 
the lions share of the cost is paid by a surtax that falls on 
all those eligible for medicare whose incomes are high enough that 
they pay at least 150 a year in federal income taxes the surtax is 
15 percent of the income tax in 1989 next year it rises to 25 
percent and each year after it could climb by as much as one 
percentage point a year 
congressional aides estimate about 40 percent of people past the 
age of 65 will pay the surtax on their 1989 income 
the maximum surtax on any person is 800 this year or 1600 for 
a couple if both spouses are eligible by 1993 it will rise to 
1050 and 2100 congress estimates the average surtax will be 
285 per person in 1989 and 506 in 1993 
a couple would have to make more than 70000 to pay the maximum 
800 premium this year bentsen said 
in addition to the surtax retirees and the disabled who buy 
medicare to pay for physicians fees are paying a higher part b 
premium because of catastrophic coverage the monthly premium is 
3110 this year and is expected to rise to 4260 a month by 1993 
some retirees are upset that they are forced to buy catastrophic 
coverage whether are not they want it and claim they could do 
better by buying private insurance 
bentsen said that for most retirees that is not so its the 
best buy in town he said of catastrophic coverage theres 
nothing in the private sector that offers what it offers at those 
prices 
although only about 7 percent of retirees are expected to collect 
on the catastrophic coverage thats far more than the chanc of a 
home burning bentsen said yet people routinely buy fire 
insurance policies he noted and predicted having the catastrophic 
policy will give people the peace of mind that they are not going 
to be wiped out financially 
he said the finance committee probably will have hearings on the 
subject but more as a way of publicizing details of the program than 
of deciding how to change the tax

requires him to charge tuition for outofstate students he said

the environmental protection agency said 
wednesday it will permit cotton farmers to use remaining stocks of 
the pesticide chlordimeform this year but will not allow them to buy 
more after feb 19 
the agency last year announced its intention to cancel licenses 
to sell chlordimeform which it said has been shown to cause tumors 
in laboratory animals 
in recent years about 1 million pounds a year went to control the 
eggs and larvae of the cotton bollworm and tobacco budworm on about 
12 percent of the nations cotton crop 
the two manufacturers cibageigy corp of greensboro nc and 
noram chemical co of wilmington del had requested cancellation 
of the licenses and said they would recall inventories from sellers 
those requests were made after epa announced its intention to 
conduct a special study of chlordimeform 
epa said it is requiring those recalls to be made is canceling 
the licenses as of feb 19 and is not permitting any use by farmers 
after oct 1 
chlordimeform has been sold as galecron by cibageigy and as 
fundal by noram 
epa said it assumed that inventories would be used up during the 
1988 growing season but drought and fewer pest problems reduced 
use considerably and resulted in leftover stocks of 100000 to 
250000 pounds on farms 
the agency said its studies showed the longterm risk of use 
would outweigh the benefits but use for one additional season 
would offer some specific benefits to cotton growers such as 
improved yields at negligible risk

the shoeshine boy waited like a hawk his 
eyes fixed on a large family eating lunch on paper plates in a park 
jagdish rajkumar a scrawny teenager was not interested in the 
food 
the moment the family finished the food and threw away the paper 
plates rajkumar darted over and tucked the plates into a bag and 
resumed his business calling out get your shoes polished for two 
rupees 13 cents 
rajkumar is one the millions of poor people across northern india 
who are collecting rags scraps of paper bits of straw and anything 
else that burns in an effort to keep warm during an unusually cold 
indian winter 
especially prized is cow dung which makes excellent fuel when 
dried and patted into cakes 
in the last four days 24 people in northern india have died 
because of the cold according to official reports newspapers put 
the death toll at 100 
this winter is mild by international standards but exceptionally 
chilly in a region better known for its torrid summer heat 
it is cold if you take into consideration a lesserdiscussed 
meteorological phenomenon said gs mondal of the new delhis 
weather office he explaned that wednesdays temperature of 42 
degrees fahrenheit combined with a 19 mph wind made it feel like 
it was just above freezing and that has a tremendous biological 
impact on us 
new delhis normal winter temperatures range from 46 to 50 but 
even a few degrees make a big difference to people with little or no 
shelter 
in between my business i collect as much paper as i can to keep 
us warm at night said rajkumar who earns about 1 a day he said 
he gives about 33 cents to police so theyll look the other way when 
he scavenges for paper in the park at connaught place new delhis 
central shopping district 
i have old parents and three sisters at home we all sleep in 
one room with a fire or we will freeze to death he said 
wood is too expensive for many 
about two pounds of wood costs seven cents and it lasts only for 
minutes so what we do is pick up everything and anything that 
burns the shoeshine boy said 
even tourists from other climates are finding the india of heat 
and dust the book and screenplay by ruth prawer jhabwala has 
turned cold 
richard and mary thomson of mill valley calif said they 
dreamed of the golden rays of tropical indian sun when they 
planned their vacation in the subcontinent 
we never thought we would be using this in india thomson 
said wednesday pointing at his sweater his first purchase in an 
indian bazaar 
i had expected india to be much warmer it is cold but i am 
enjoying it said eric eubank 19 of frederick md a philosophy 
student at st andrews presbyterian college in laurinburg nc 
when you think of india you think of the heat and not cold 
in our country it is cold too but there we have centrally 
heated homes and offices here there is none said nanna 
rosenstock of copenhagen denmark we manage here but we wonder 
what the poor among the indians do 
hundreds of people succumb to cold weather in india every year 
because they do not have adequate clothing shelter and food some 
of those fortunate enough to have homes die of carbon monoxide from 
unventilated fires 
beggars migrant laborers and other poorest of the poor are the 
hardest hit because they have no shelter they normally sleep in 
parks on sidewalks or under bridges 
as nightfall approaches some head to railway stations and 
governmentrun shelters others bribe guards at government buildings 
to let them to spend the night in the corridors 
private organizations such as churches distribute free blankets 
and quilts to the poor the government has little in the way of 
assistance programs apart from five public shelters which can 
accommodate only a few thousand people 
what can we do asked m meshi spokesman for the new delhis 
municipal corporation the capitals administrative organization 
every day thousands of people pour into the city looking for jobs 
we cant look after them all

a woman accused of joining a plot to 
bring down the government acted only as a mother and a wife when she 
joined her husband in his clandestine life her attorney told a 
federal jury wednesday 
his reasons were political her reasons were personal 
attorney william newman said in opening arguments in defense of 
patricia h gros levasseur 40 
mrs levasseur is the wife of codefendant raymond luc levasseur 
42 of calais maine the couple and richard williams 41 of 
boston are on trial in us district court on charges of seditious 
conspiracy racketeering enterprise and racketeering conspiracy 
the three are accused of belonging to the united freedom front 
and the sam melvillejonathan jackson unit a group that allegedly 
plotted bombings and bank robberies throughout the northeast from 
1976 until their arrest in 1984 prosecutors say their purpose was 
to overthrow the government 
among the 19 bombings they are accused of planning was a 1976 
explosion at the suffolk superior courthouse in boston that injured 
22 people 
newman told the 12 jurors and five alternates that mrs levasseur 
grew up in a large poor family in eastern maryland and was deeply 
affected by racial segregation and the impact of the vietnam war on 
her neighborhood 
he said she became active in community work after leaving home 
including literacy and childcare programs and met levasseur in 
1976 through a prisonreform group in portland maine 
newman said mrs levasseur joined her husband in his decision to 
live away from the eyes and ears of the government in 1976 
because she had borne his child the couple had two more children 
before they were arrested in november 1984 in deerfield ohio 
the attorney described her work before her arrest as that of a 
fulltime mother who participated in school bake sales and took her 
children shopping and to doctors appointments 
she did everything you expect a normal caring mother to do 
he said the evidence will not establish that she ever robbed a 
bank ever cased a bank ever drove a getaway car there will be 
no proof that she ever built a bomb or ever set a bomb 
the trial opened tuesday with assistant us attorney michael 
loucks saying he intended to show the defendants conspired to bomb 
courthouses military offices and corporations and planned robberies 
from maine to virginia 
levasseur serving as his own lawyer called himself a 
revolutionary in opening arguments tuesday and noted that one of the 
explosions listed in the indictment occurred shortly after 
antiapartheid demonstrators were fired upon in south africa 
he told the jury you ought to ask yourself the question who 
are the real criminals those who oppose racist acts in south africa 
or those who support government interests in south africa 
the three defendants were among eight arrested in one of the 
largest manhunts in us history one will be tried separately two 
have have pleaded guilty to charges and prosecutors dropped charges 
against two others because they are already serving long prison 
terms

congress to reject a proposal to let farmers collect federal 
subsidies without regard to the kind of crops they produce 
nfu president leland swenson said the idea known as 
decoupling would be devastating for farmers and rural 
communities endanger the environment and destablize the position of 
third world farmers 
swenson told a news conference that decoupling would be a 
shortterm welfare program and will be opposed vigorously by nfu 
lobbyists 
decoupling has been around for years but has not had great 
support on capitol hill one of the early decisions by the incoming 
bush administration will be whether to embrace decoupling as a way 
of containing government farm costs 
the nfus main rival the american farm bureau federation at one 
time supported decoupling but since has backed off to give it a 
closer look 
one of the biggest advocates is the heritage foundation a 
washingtonbased conservative think tank which recently issued a 
task force report saying that one of the first jobs of the bush 
administration should be to cut subsidies and get farmers off the 
dole 
decoupling the heritage report said would allow federal 
payments to farmers to be based on a flat rate and targeted to those 
most in need as it has been for more than half a century payments 
now are pegged to specific kinds of crops and levels of production 
the larger the farm the larger the subsidy 
under decoupling farmers would simply be given a cash payment 
and then be free to grow or not grow any crop they choose 
planting decisions with decoupling would then be based on 
market signals consumer demand for a product rather than on what 
is required by washington the heritage report said 
swenson also released a report analyzing a decoupling bill 
introduced by sen rudy boschwitz rminn in 1985 as the family 
farm protection and full production act he said the bill continues 
to have some support in congress along with backing from big grain 
companies such as cargill inc 
its really a copout in addressing the real issue of adopting 
and implementing a farm program which enhances the market price for 
agricultural commodities swenson said it implies that the 
family farm structure of agricuture is not important 
the analysis used figures attributed to the institute for trade 
and agricultrure st paul minn showing that the boschwitz bill 
would reduce federal price support loans sharply for major crops 
including wheat to 160 per bushel from 206 this year and corn 
to 130 per bushel from the 1989 rate of 165 
lowering of world prices a result of decoupling would 
aggravate the situation of third world farmers who are our best 
potential customers for us food exports swenson said 
the nfu he said will draft its own alternative to decoupling to 
assure consumers an adequate and dependable supply of food and 
enhance the market price of agricultural commodities 
although swenson did not disclose details of what nfus plan 
might include he said it would reduce the budget impact of farm 
programs and allow for a continued expansion of agricultural 
exports 
the 1988 drought helped siphon off huge stockpiles of us grain 
boosting market prices for wheat to an average of 389 per bushel 
last month from 270 a year earlier corn in december according to 
the agriculture department averaged 254 per bushel compared to 
the yearearlier mark of 172 per bushel 
swenson was asked if the nfu would recommend an increase in 
federal price supports to as much as current market prices he 
replied or higher 
the reagan administration for eight years has been committed to a 
marketoriented farm policy less reliance on federal controls and 
freer world trade those ideals are expected to continue under the 
bush administration 
but swenson is not convinced at this time that foreign countries 
will go along with current us agricultural trade objectives in the 
bush administration than they have in the reagan years 
there isnt such a thing as a free market swenson said it 
doesnt exist will not exist either in this country or any other 
major exporting country in the world

the commander of the next space 
shuttle mission said wednesday he is certain engineers will resolve 
outstanding tile and engine problems in time to meet a feb 23 
launch 
all indications are that the people who are working those two 
problems are confident theyre going to come up with good answers on 
both and they should not impact our launch astronaut michael 
coats said as he an his four crew members held a news conference to 
discuss their flight aboard discovery 
atlantis returned from orbit last month with severe damage to 
about 200 of the 28000 tiles that protect it from reentry heat 
the most tile damage ever sustained by a shuttle and during 
postflight inspection two small cracks were found in a bearing 
unit in a highpressure engine turbopump 
the engine problem is probably unique to that engine coats 
said theyre looking at discoverys engines now and they have 
spare turbopumps in case they have to make a replacement 
engineers believe the cracks were caused by moisture that somehow 
penetrated the housing that holds the bearing 
coats who flew on one previous shuttle mission a discovery 
flight in august 1984 said it appeared that atlantis tiles were 
damaged by insulation falling off the nose cone of one of the solid 
fuel booster rockets during liftoff 
were concerned about what caused the damage and are confident 
it will be resolved he said but were also reassured because 
despite all the damage atlantis tiles took it survived im sure 
our tiles will get us through reentry im not going to have 
butterflies about it 
discoverys fiveday flight is set for liftoff at 830 am est 
on feb 23 flying with coats will be pilot john blaha and mission 
specialists robert springer james buchli and james bagian buchli 
is the only other shuttle veteran on the crew he flew aboard 
discovery in january 1983 
their main task will be to deploy a tracking and data relay 
satellite to complete a network of payloads that will enable ground 
control centers to communicate almost full time with the space 
shuttle and with several unmanned satellites 
the astronauts will conduct several scientific and medical 
experiments including one in which four rats will be used to 
determine how well injured bones heal in the weightlessness of 
space the legs of the rats will be deliberately cut before launch 
the bone reparation process is an interesting question that has 
to be answered before man takes extended space flights said 
bagian a medical doctor who will observe the rats in orbit 
the crew also will use a powerful imax camera to record damage 
that man and nature are causing to planet earth 
from space astronauts can see how fragile earth really is 
said springer we want to document it 
among the things the camera will photograph he said are 
volcanoes in nicaragua and indonesia areas that have been 
deforested in brazil and madagascar the sahara desert in africa 
and beach erosion around the globe 
discoverys flight will be the third for a shuttle since the 1986 
challenger disaster and coats said were anxious to show that 
were back in the space business to stay on a routine basis 
he said the mission will be a good kickoff to a busy year in 
which seven shuttle launches are planned including the first two 
that will dispatch probes to the planets magellan to venus in 
april and galileo to jupiter in october

rock hudsons former lover denied wednesday 
that he filed an 11 million lawsuit against the late screen idols 
estate because he was left out of hudsons will or because he wanted 
the publicity 
marc christian told los angeles county superior court jurors that 
he filed the civil lawsuit because rock hudson continued to have 
sex with me when he found out he had aids 
christian 35 said hudsons secretary mark miller also hid 
news about the illness from him until he saw a television newscast 
revealing that hudson had aids 
the actor died from complications of the disease in october 1985 
the defense had portrayed christian in opening statements friday 
as a publicity seeker and an opportunist who was angry because he 
was left out of hudsons will after their 2year relationship 
christian an aspiring musician denied both allegations 
i knew that by filing this lawsuit id never have an 
opportunity to work in this town christian said during 
questioning by his attorney anyone who wants a career in 
hollywood cannot divulge hes homosexual 
christians emotional distress lawsuit alleges bodily injury 
mental suffering and damages for fraud and deceit against the wills 
executor miller and an unspecified number of doctors 
christian has tested negative for aids antibodies but claims he 
will be susceptible to the disease for a lifetime some medical 
experts believe antibodies will be detected no later than six months 
after a sexual encounter with an infected partner 
attorneys for christian have said the key issue in the lawsuit is 
whether hudsons doctors had a duty to tell christian he was being 
exposed to the disease by engaging in sex with the actor

a judge has rejected a request to cover 
a courtroom mural of the biblical character king solomon during the 
trial of a man accused of killing a mother and her young daughter 
the mural behind shelby circuit court judge charles oconners 
bench depicts king solomons decision in the case of two women who 
claimed to be the mother of the same infant 
solomon threatened to cut the baby in half and give part to each 
woman before one asked him to spare the child and give him to the 
other solomon then knew that the woman willing to give up the child 
to save its life must be the real mother 
the painting depicts a soldier ready to strike the infant with a 
sword 
lawyer michael mcdaniel said the painting could bias the jury 
against his client james kenneth utley charged in the death of 
karen smith and her 3yearold daughter jacqueline in their new 
washington home in february 
mcdaniel also said clark county prosecutor jerome jacobi has a 
habit of making biblical references during trials during a recent 
murder trial jacobi referred to the story of cain and abel 
mcdaniel said 
the judge rejected mcdaniels motion tuesday and instructed 
jacobi not to refer to the mural during the trial which is to begin 
jan 31 
the case was venued to shelby county because of publicity in

a greekturkish dispute that is blocking 
accord on a date for new eastwest arms talks has been turned over 
to nato foreign ministers who will try to break the deadlock 
diplomats said wednesday 
the diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said a 
solution was unlikely before thursday although meetings continued 
in vienna to try to break the impasse 
the deadlock also threatened to hold up a landmark human rights 
agreement by the 35nation helsinki review conference whose final 
document must include a mandate for new arms talks 
washington had insisted wednesday as a deadline for agreement on 
new eastwest talks on reducing conventional forces and weapons 
across europe said a source in another western delegation 
agreement on the arms talks has been stymied by a greekturkish 
dispute involving the eastern mediterranean port of mersin which 
turkey wants excluded from the talks 
the port is a main shipping point for supplies to northern 
cyprus which is controlled by turkey 
the soviet union agreed to exclude the port but greece 
traditionally wary of turkey and concerned about cyprus is 
insisting mersin be included 
western diplomatic sources expressing frustration over the 
impasse said they had turned the dispute over to unidentified nato 
foreign ministers for resolution 
the talks are to encompass conventional weapons and troops across 
europe from the atlantic to the ural mountains in the soviet union 
they will replace the mutual and balanced force reduction talks 
which began in vienna in 1973 and continue without agreement 
meanwhile austria has invited the foreign ministers of the 34 
other nations in the helsinki review conference to vienna next week 
for ceremonies to close the conference which began in november 1986 
austrian foreign minister alois mock said wednesday he was 
confident the ceremonies would go ahead as planned 
but one diplomat said the arrangements hung on a fine thread 
the mandate for the new arms talks must be included in the final 
document wrapping up the helsinki conference that document should 
be ready by friday if mocks plans are to hold 
if the conference is not wrapped up next week there could be a 
delay of several weeks while the administration of presidentelect 
george bush takes over diplomats say 
if that happens nations unhappy with certain points of the 
helsinki draft accord might demand it be changed diplomats fear 
romania already has objected to 17 key human rights provisions 
but has not said whether it would reject the document which must be 
approved by all 35 nations for passage 
the united states canada soviet union and all european nations 
except albania are taking part in the helsinki review conference

protesters demanding the release of nelson mandela 
and other jailed activists marked the 1000 day of their protest 
thursday on a sidewalk outside the south african embassy 
visitors to this citys famous trafalgar square often treat the 
protesters like a permanent fixture sympathizers stop and chat 
foreign tourists and embassy callers seeking visas shoot the breeze 
pop singer boy george once joined the protesters for an hour or so 
passersby and local shop owners send food hot drinks and 
greetings cards 
the pickets have persisted through cold wind rain and more than 
600 arrests mostly for obstruction magistrates courts have thrown 
out most of the charges according to the city of london 
antiapartheid group which runs the protest 
i think all the fresh air has helped to keep me healthy said 
lorna reid 23 from edinburgh who joined the picket on its first 
day april 19 1986 she still does sixhour shifts despite 14 
arrests 
the embassy says it has occasionally called the police to deal 
with mischievous incidents but accepts the pickets right to be 
there under british law 
the protest usually consists of three or four young people at any 
one time they distribute leaflets and magazines display banners 
and fly the black green and yellow flag of the african national 
congress from a pole mounted in an auto tire 
anc leader mandela 70 is the most prominent of antiapartheid 
activists jailed in south africa 
he was convicted of sabotage and subversion in 1964 and jailed 
for life last year he was admitted to a hospital with tuberculosis 
and later transferred to a home on a prison farm 
the picketers have received thanks from his wife winnie 
mandela and the other prisoners are fighting their nations 
apartheid system by law and custom apartheid establishes a 
racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no 
vote in national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy 
and maintain separate districts schools and health services 
the london demonstrators ask passersby to sign a petition for 
release of the south african prisoners they say they have collected 
over 1 million signatures 
we had a few hundred members when we started and we have 1600 
now all races including people who have been in prison in south 
africa said carol brickley one of the protest leaders we have 
three rules for the picket no drink no drugs behave 
two police officers face the protest around the clock near the 
embassys public entrance another officer guards the staff entrance 
around the corner 
the protest was branded a scourge in may 1988 by john 
carlisle a lawmaker of the governing conservative party he urged 
that police be empowered to remove it but the government did not 
respond 
some protesters say cold may be an even bigger scourge to them 
than hostile politicians 
cold is the first thing you have to learn to deal with we wear 
a lot of thin layers of clothing said 18yearold mark farmaner

police are worried that radical leftists may mount 
terrorist attacks possibly with homemade missiles when more than 
100 foreign dignitaries arrive for emperor hirohitos funeral an 
official said wednesday 
the national police agency official said security forces for next 
months funeral would exceed those at the may 1986 tokyo summit of 
seven major industrial nations he said they numbered 30000 at that 
event 
he said at least six ultraleftist groups have threatened to 
sabotage the feb 24 funeral for the emperor who died saturday at 
the age of 87 japanese leftists have demanded abolition of the 
monarchy which plays a largely symbolic role under japans 
postworld war ii constitution 
presidentelect george bush is to head the us delegation to the 
funeral other expected dignitaries include prince philip of 
britain the kings of sweden and belgium and presidents suharto of 
indonesia and mauno koivist of finland 
the police official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
about 10000 people are expected to attend the ceremony in the 
shinjuku imperial garden in central tokyo 
in addition he said we have to guard almost the entire city 
of tokyo because more than 100 guests from abroad will probably be 
staying in different places in tokyo for a few days before and after 
the funeral 
officials view one of the main threats as chukakuha or middle 
core faction a leftwing guerrilla group that fired several 
missiles at the site of the 1986 summit they overshot their target 
and no injuries were reported 
the group has vowed an attack on the hirohito funeral and 
ceremonies for the new emperor akihito 
police believe the group has the technology to fire a missile 
more than 2 miles and they may have even more advanced 
technology today the official said 
if the funeral site was attacked by such a bomb the casualties 
would be bound to be enormous he said if anything happened to 
any of the foreign guests while they were in japan it definitely 
would develop into major diplomatic problems 
he said police plan to set up several hundred checkpoints to 
control incoming traffic on most major streets in tokyo 
the best defense is to prevent the group from bringing in 
dangerous members within missile projection range he said 
the japanese red army also has declared it would blow up the 
funeral but the official said that group was less capable of 
mounting a domestic attack in recent years it has been operating 
mainly outside the country 
the group is blamed for at least seven major terrorist acts 
worldwide including a 1973 attack at lod airport in israel in which 
24 people were killed in 1987 it bombed a us servicemens club 
in naples italy killing five people including a us servicewoman 
the official said the red army may be targeting japanese 
embassies abroad which are accepting condolence calls for the late 
emperor 
they could disguise themselves walk into embassies and occupy 
them and demand the release of their colleagues under arrest in 
japan he said 
to help embassies and authorities abroad police have distributed 
25000 englishlanguage posters with pictures of red army members 
believed to be outside japan in japan they plan to put up 300000 
similar posters to help find any members who sneaked back home the 
official said

the fbi is investigating a general electric 
admission that test records may have been falsified at a factory 
which made parts for the engine that failed on a jetliner in 
england according to court documents and federal officials 
the seattle factory which made parts for the cfm56 engine used by 
the boeing 737 also manufactured a check and flow valve for the f404 
engine aboard the navys fa18 fighter ge spokesman richard kennedy 
said wednesday 
a letter from a ge attorney last year said test records may have 
been falsified for the fighter plane valves papers filed by the 
office of the us attorney in cincinnati said the fbi is 
investigating that case 
fortyfour people died in the boeing 737 crash in which the crew 
apparently turned off the right engine after the left engine failed 
for unexplained reasons the investigation of the crash is 
continuing 
the timer valve manufactured by ge for the cfm56 engine on the 
737 could not have caused the turbine to fail even if the valve 
malfunctioned kennedy said in telephone interview from his office 
in cincinnati 
however ge attorney robert c anderson said in a letter dated 
june 2 1988 that in late may 1988 it was discovered that prior 
to july 1987 a particular flow leak check which is required by 
geae general electric aircraft engine specifications was not 
performed on the f404 check and drain valves 
it is believed that the test was discontinued sometime in 1983 
possibly as a result of the test fixture becoming broken anderson 
said the letter obtained by the associated press 
the test was reinstituted in july 1987 when the problem was 
detected by lower level personnel in the plant the letter said 
during the period involved it is also believed that operators 
may have falsified internal test records which are maintained to 
reflect actual test readings anderson said in the letter 
andersons letter does not indicate the total number of engines 
or their value but said that the deliveries covered the periods of 
aprilmay 1984 aprilmay 1985 aprilmay 1986 and aprilmay 1987 
navy spokeswoman lt nettie johnson said that the f404 was used 
in the fa18 fighter but was unable to say immediately whether the 
aircraft had experienced problems from faulty check and drain valves 
defense department officials said they had received andersons 
letter as part of what they called a voluntary disclosure 
program for companies that believe they have not met the terms of 
their contracts 
the inspector generals office in the pentagon in conjunction 
with the fbi is investigating the admissions in the letter said 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
in nearly every instance of voluntary disclosure an 
investigation follows said one source who was familiar with the 
case falsifying records falls into the area of product 
substitution in which the government pays for something to be 
tested and it is not tested 
james helmer an attorney representing the former manager of the 
ge plant said his client had been questioned in connection with the 
investigation last oct 14 by two fbi agents and a representative of 
the air force 
helmers client anthony l divencenzo filed suit against 
general electric last year on behalf of the government seeking to 
recover damages for more than 2000 f404 engines that helmer said 
were delivered without inspection 
at the request of the justice department all documents in the 
divencenzo suit remained under seal until last friday when us 
district court judge carl rubin denied a federal motion to allow the 
justice department until feb 1 to decide whether to join the case 
as a plaintiff 
the motion filed by assistant us attorney gerald f kaminski 
said the investigation of the allegations set forth in the 
complaint that is being conducted by the federal bureau of 
investigation is not complete due to the factual complexities 
involved in the case 
while the criminal investigation may take substantially longer 
to conclude it is anticipated that the fbi will obtain sufficient 
information to determine whether or not it will intervene herein 
said the federal motion 
the justice defense and navy departments will require another 
week to review that information the motion said 
michael crites us attorney for cincinnati declined to diclose 
further details of the investigation or indicate when the government 
would decide whether to intervene 
i cant say anything more than what was in that motion which 
is a matter of public record crites said in a telephone 
interview asked when the government would make its decision crites 
said i dont have a timetable on it

surgeon general c everett koop on wednesday 
urged americans to continue the gains made over the last 25 years in 
the fight against smoking by aiming efforts at women young people 
and others likely to pick up the habit 
koop said the decline in the proportion of american smokers from 
40 percent of the population in 1965 to 29 percent in 1987 was a 
revolution in smoking behavior 
but he said the fact that 50 million americans still smoke that 
women are quitting more slowly than men and that young people are 
continuing to start presents enormous challenges in continuing the 
downward trend in smoking 
koop spoke at a news conference at which he issued a new 
government report on smoking that documents changes that have 
occurred in the 25 years since the surgeon general first declared 
cigarette smoking caused cancer and death 
he said antismoking campaigns have educated the public about the 
hazards of smoking and a growing number of states communities and 
businesses are enacting smoking restrictions but more efforts are 
needed he said 
during the next quarter century and beyond progress will be 
slow and smokingrelated mortality will remain high unless the 
health community more effectively reaches children and adolescents 
women minorities and bluecollar workers he said in the report 
meanwhile the tobacco institute the tobacco industrys lobbying 
organization was running fullpage ads in major newspapers around 
the country this week supporting smokers and declaring enough is 
enough 
the ads said there has been enough taxation legislation 
control censorship harassment and discrimination directed against 
smokers 
koop discounted the institutes claims including its point that 
smokers pay 10 billion in cigarette taxes which the lobbying group 
called more than their fair share koop said that adds up to 
only 30 percent of the direct health costs the government pays to 
take care of smokingrelated illnesses and disabilities 
he added the tobacco people should begin to discriminate 
against advertising to the very people who have the highest problem 
with smoking namely teenagers and those in minority groups and 
those who are bluecollar workers 
instead he said cigarette manufacturers appear to be aiming 
many of their ads at young people to lure them into the smoking 
habit 
if you look at advertising now compared to 15 years ago youll 
find that the models have gotten extraordinarily young beautiful 
chic sophisticated and sexy and if that isnt something that isnt 
appealing to young people i dont know what is 
figures in koops report showed that antismoking efforts have 
been most successful in getting men to quit half of all men smoked 
in 1965 but by 1987 less than a third were lighting up 
women smokers declined from 32 percent to 27 percent over the 
period the report said 
the figures also show a slow decline over the period among blacks 
and bluecollar workers and virtually no change among those who 
never graduated from high school 
among high school seniors daily cigarette smoking dropped from 
29 percent in 1976 to 21 percent in 1980 and then leveled off in the 
1821 percent range for the seven years after that

carlos fajardo took his family 
across the rainbow bridge into canada and lost the pot of gold that 
had been their lives in the united states 
fajardo who struggled for 20 years to leave his native cuba 
accidentally deported himself and his family by crossing the border 
on a 20minute sightseeing trip dec 23 
even though the family lived in the united states for four years 
federal immigration officials will not allow them back because they 
are illegal aliens 
they are stranded in a motel in niagara falls ontario 
we came for 20 minutes fajardo said no one told us we 
could not go back 
fajardo 39 a small softspoken man said the ordeal began dec 
20 when they set out from their home in miami on a christmas quest 
to find snow which his adopted children yoandys 12 and yordalys 
9 had never seen 
as he spoke tuesday his wife and children sat watching 
television in their small motel room he would occassionally turn to 
the boy yoandys to help him answer in english 
fajardo said the quest brought them 1500 miles in their truck to 
niagara falls ny where they checked into a motel and planned to 
visit canada he told canadian border guards his family wanted to 
see the horseshoe falls 
when they returned however us border guards demanded to see 
proof of their citizenship all fajardo had was a florida drivers 
license 
at first fajardo maintained that he was a us citizen later he 
said he was a resident alien but immigration officials after a 
search of their records determined otherwise 
benedict ferro director of the federal immigration and 
naturalization service office in buffalo said fajardos wife 
bermaida and her two children entered the united states illegally 
in 1985 and that fajardo entered the country illegally in 1986 
fajardo denies entering the country illegally 
an immigration judge in 1987 denied asylum to mrs fajardo and 
the two children she appealed the decision in august on grounds 
that she would face persecution if returned to cuba but her appeal 
was rejected 
fajardos application for asylum was pending when he crossed the 
border his status was officially nullified by leaving the country 
ferro said 
fajardo could reapply but his wife and children cannot because 
they previously provided fraudulent information to immigration 
officials ferro said 
the family lied and their credibility is about zero at this 
point ferro said 
canadian authorities have given the family permission to stay in 
canada until sunday what happens to them after that is uncertain 
us sen bob graham dfla urged immigration officials to 
allow the family to return to florida for humanitarian reasons 
this family has strong ties to the miami community through 
relatives business and local school attendence graham said in a 
letter tuesday to ins officials it would be comforting to these 
people for them to be able to resume their wellestablished lives 
under terms of a bond he posted in order to leave cuba fajardo 
agreed not to return to his homeland he said he left the country in 
1984 with only the clothes on his back 
he achieved relative prosperity in the united states working a 
number of jobs including his current one as a boat builder and 
said he owns a home in miami 
it has been nearly three weeks since the family checked into the 
motel in ontario and theyve seen more than enough snow 
we are all very tired he said the children are missing 
school we want to go home 
now the family is running low on money said sister margaret 
quinn of fort erie ontario who has been providing assistance 
through the niagara refugee committee 
sister quinn has urged american and canadian immigration

the soviet union has resumed its troop 
withdrawal from afghanistan despite an impasse in negotiations with 
usarmed rebels over a future government in kabul the state 
department said wednesday 
transports carried troops out of the country while other elements 
of the red army streamed northward from the soviet garrison in the 
capital spokesman charles e redman said 
the soviets agreed last april to withdraw all forces by feb 15 
but declared a suspension in november to protest attacks by the 
usbacked rebels on departing units about 50000 troops remain in 
the country 
the united states had urged the mujahadeen to hold their fire 
but the collapse last saturday of negotiations between the soviets 
and the rebels on a government to succeed the promoscow regime in 
kabul raised new obstacles 
returning to moscow yuli vorontsov a first deputy foreign 
minister who is also ambassador to afghanistan warned on tuesday 
that there was serious danger that the soviets would not meet 
the feb 15 deadline 
he said whether the 50000 troops could be withdrawn within five 
weeks would depend on the afghan guerrillas willingness to accept a 
ceasefire and on the outcome of negotiations to form a new 
government 
most observers expect president najibullahs regime to collapse 
once it loses the backing of soviet troops who helped wage a 
nineyear war with the guerrillas 
reagan administration officials responded they still expected the 
soviets to meet their commitment some western observers in moscow 
were quoted as seeing vorontsovs warning as an attempt to pressure 
the rebels into a political settlement 
even so redman said we continue to see evidence that the 
soviets are in the process of preparing to withdraw 
he said these signs include the overland movement north of 
soviet troops from the kabul garrison in recent days and the 
closure of the soviet military hospital in kabul 
moreover redman said we have noted an increase in flights by 
aeroflot transport aircraft into and out of the kabul airport 
his statement apparently was based on western intelligence 
reports and the us official declined to provide further details

support for civil rights measures and steps to 
assist the poor are growing nationwide according to a survey of 
racial attitudes released wednesday 
americans do have a conscience pollster louis harris told a 
news conference in unveiling the survey taken by his organization on 
behalf of the naacp legal defense and educational fund 
he said surveys began to find an increase in support for civil 
rights measures such as the busing of pupils to achieve school 
integration as early as 1986 the latest poll said opposition to 
busing has dropped to 54 percent among all americans after hovering 
at 78 percent for three decades 
it found 57 percent of whites opposed to busing but said that 
for the first time 51 percent of whites favor it when the buses 
carry pupils to top quality schools in the inner city and blacks to 
equally good schools outside their neighborhoods 
the survey found that 93 percent of whites and 95 percent of 
blacks favored special school programs beginning at age 8 to 
motivate poor youngsters to stay in school 
it said 90 percent of whites and 95 percent of blacks favored 
setting up federal camps where poor young people could learn 
reading writing and other skills similar majorities supported 
business incentives to provide jobs in poor neighborhoods 
seventynine percent of blacks and 81 percent of whites said the 
best longterm way to combat crime was not to spend large sums of 
money sending criminals to prison and keeping them there a long 
time but to spend the same money attacking the causes of crime 
such as reducing poverty keeping young people in school and 
motivating young people to succeed rather than become criminals 
the poll was taken june 3 through sept 12 by louis harris and 
associates and was based on interviews with more than 3000 people 
harris said that the error margin was plus or minus 2 percent 
the new yorkbased naacp legal defense and educational fund inc 
was founded in 1940 by the national association for the advancement 
of colored people but is now a separate and distinct organization 
it has been a part of many major civil rights court battles in 
recent decades and for the last 12 years has also campaigned in the 
legislative arena 
the survey demonstrates that the public is primed for 
presidential action and leadership on racerelations issues said 
elaine jones deputy directorcounsel of the organization the 
missing ingredient is strong leadership thats what we look to the 
new administration to provide 
she was critical of the reagan administrations record but added 
that there is reason to hope that the inauguration of george bush 
will usher in a new approach to civil rights at the white house and 
in the justice department 
julius chambers the groups directorcounsel said the study 
titled the unfinished agenda on race in america demonstrates 
there is a solid base of support for change 
on issue after issue blacks and whites agree that active 
leadership is needed to bring about real equality between the 
races he said

pledging to press forward efforts to remove vietnamese troops from 
cambodia 
foreign minister siddhi savetsila of thailand told a news 
conference that he believes a settlement will be well in place by 
september cambodias prohanoi government suggested last week that 
vietnamese troops could withdraw by then if thailand denies 
sanctuary to cambodian guerrillas and countries including thailand 
halt aid to rebels 
i think after september everything will be all right the 
thai foreign minister said wednesday the motion will be in full 
spin

after vietnamesethai talks that both sides are satisfied 
both sides have agreed it the cambodian conflict will be 
solved soon by september 1989 within the framework of a 
political settlement said thach also deputy premier 
vietnam has said it will pull out its forces by 1990 regardless 
of a political settlement 
president heng samrin of cambodia said last week that 50000 
vietnamese troops are in cambodia but western intelligence 
officials estimate the number at about 65000 guerrillas say 
120000 vietnamese troops are in the country calling his meetings 
with vietnamese officials in hanoi on monday and tuesday a turning 
point in relations siddhi said wednesday we must now seek to 
speed up the efforts to achieve a political settlement 
however he denied cambodian resistance groups were provided 
refuge in his country saying we dont have any sanctuary in 
thailand we have refugee camps

rouge during whose rule hundreds of thousands of cambodians were 
killed

resistance coalition battling the sovietbacked vietnamese china

iranian president ali khamenei on 
wednesday ordered lifting on some controls over foreign trade in a 
move that may further bolster the resurgent private sector in irans 
postwar economy 
the official islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia 
quoted khamenei as saying the commerce ministry should ease its grip 
on the economy and hand over some responsibilities such as trade 
to the people 
our brave smart and mature people are not lacking anything and 
can do the job themselves khamenei said in a reference to the 
private sector 
the ministry controls more than 80 percent of irans trade 
the government has been relaxing the tight controls imposed 
during its eightyear war with iraq the two sides signed a 
ceasefire in august 
the cashstrapped government has been trying to attract private 
funds to pay for imports to ease shortages widespread corruption in 
the governments bloated bureaucracy is also believed to be a reason 
for easing state control 
a heated debate over the economy has dragged on for years and 
polarized irans leadership into pragmatists led by khamenei and 
parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani and hardliners such as prime 
minister hussein musavi 
the huge task of postwar reconstruction has brought the 
differences into sharp focus moves by the pragmatists to relax 
political and social restrictions as well as economic restraints 
have intensified the wrangles 
khamenei is backed by a wealthy merchant class known as 
bazaaris who largely financed the 1979 revolution which brought to 
power the islamic regime under ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the 
merchants have pushed for a more laissezfaire economy 
musavi under fire for his economic policies during the war 
seeks wider state control as he says to lessen the gap between 
rich and poor 
the government last month listed about 40 scarce items that could 
be privately imported for a trial period of two years they ranged 
from medical equipment and agricultural products to pens and books 
acting commerce minister abdolhassan vahhaji said more items will 
be deregulated he said that with the implementation of this plan 
the prices of goods will come down and it will create economic calm 
and stability

what began as a dispute over a 200 fee 
for a sewer line extension led to prison wednesday for a 73yearold 
man with cancer who said he rejected a nocost solution out of 
principle 
im going to prison so maybe i can help someone else theyre 
discriminating against said wilburt siegel a retired metal 
worker who suffers from rectal cancer 
siegel likened his sixmonth sentence for contempt of court to a 
life term because he said a judge could keep him in jail as long as 
he refused to budge from his position that utility officials gave 
him unequal service 
a large american flag hung from the porch of siegels modest 
james island home and yellow ribbons were tied around towering pines 
as sheriff al cannon escorted him away for the 40mile trip to the 
lieber correctional institution 
the decadelong battle that led to siegals imprisonment was a 
dispute over an ordinary sewer connection that officials have bent 
over backwards to resolve said ray patterson chairman of the 
james island public service district 
the siegels paid a tapin fee in 1979 but when the sewer line 
was laid it ended at the corner of their lot they said it was too 
far away and would require them to spend 2000 and take down four 
large pine trees to make the connection 
siegel said the line should be extended in front of his house 
where a straight 30foot connection could be made the utility was 
willing to extend the line at the time but the siegels would have 
been billed 200 more said patterson 
they didnt want to pay the 200 at the time said patterson 
who said the work would cost the public 1200 today 
patterson said it would cost only 700 to connect to the corner 
tap and the commissioners even offered to come out on their own time 
and dig the ditch 
a charleston heights plumber offered to make the connection for 
free on tuesday but the siegels declined saying they didnt want 
charity 
whats the difference where the tap is if somebody puts it in 
free and you dont have to pay for it patterson said adding the 
siegels were just looking for publicity and to get sympathy 
siegels wife hattie said the issue is fair treatment 
we never asked for money we want to be treated the way other 
people are treated she said adding other area residents have 
taps much nearer their houses 
siegel said more than 100 homes havent tapped into the system 
but he was the one who was singled out and eventually arrested 
im not scared because im going to jail im doing this to 
show my rights to america six months is a long time for anybody to 
go to jail especially on a charge like this he said 
patterson said other cases are being handled on a casebycase 
basis 
a nov 1 order signed by circuit judge william howell found 
siegel in contempt of a 1986 ruling that he make the connection 
howell gave siegel 60 days to hook up or go to prison 
siegel will appear in court after serving his sentence and 
predicted hell probably be returned to prison 
i have a life sentence for not hooking up to an unequal sewer 
line he said 
the siegels had brought a 500000 federal lawsuit against the 
utility challenging its right to require the sewer connection that 
action was dismissed last year

the commander of un observers monitoring 
the cuban troop withdrawal from angola said wednesday he is 
satisfied he will be able to verify their departure independently 
despite south africas reservations 
i think there will be no difficulties in carrying this 
assignment out brazilian gen pericles ferreira gomes told 
reporters who asked about the abilities of his 10nation team of 70 
military and 20 civilian observers 
also in luanda on wednesday jesse jackson said the united states 
has a moral obligation to support the peace process it has mediated 
in angola instead of destabilizing the government by backing 
rightwing rebels 
ferreira gomes said the success of his 27month mission depends 
on the good will of the angolan and cuban governments which are to 
supply precise numbers of cuban troops in the country 
south african foreign minister roelof pik botha has expressed 
doubts about relying on angolan and cuban figures 
on dec 22 the three countries signed a usbrokered agreement 
for the phased withdrawal of cuban troops from angola paving the 
way for the independence of the south africancontrolled territory 
of namibia also called southwest africa 
cuba first sent troops to luanda in 1975 to support president 
jose eduardo dos santos angolan popular liberation movement in its 
fight against south africanbacked rebels of unita the national 
union for the total independence of angola 
unita which has about 25000 fighters was not party to 
decembers agreement and says it will continue attacking government 
troops 
on tuesday a symbolic contingent of 450 cubans departed by plane 
for havana un observer col arvid geirulv of norway said they 
were followed wednesday by 1000 more troops on a soviet ship 
under the agreement 3000 cuban troops are to have left by april 
1 
ferreira gomes said he was informed all 3000 will be gone by 
sunday 
he said 50000 was the basic figure for the number of cuban 
troops to be withdrawn but angola and cuba are to furnish exact 
figures once the observer mission is officially established april 1 
all the troops are to be out by mid1991 
we dont have the information about with what regularity the 
cubans rotate their troops he said but we are certain they 
will all be withdrawn 
asked about unita claims that some cuban troops have been granted 
angolan citizenship to enable them to remain in the country he said 
his mission was to verify numbers of troops withdrawn not 
nationalities 
he said the unarmed observer force would check the number of 
troops actually departing from four ports and one airport against 
lists furnished by the cubans and angolans 
the general said angolas government is committed to providing 
transport to un observers who have a mandate to travel anywhere 
in the country 
but land mines and the guerrilla presence makes road travel 
difficult in most of this country 14 times the size of portugal 
if we get information from whatever source that there are cuban 
troops where they should not be we are authorizied to send in 
verification teams said ferreira gomes 
at a joint news conference wednesday us civil rights leader 
jackson and president dos santos stressed the importance of 
washington establishing diplomatic relations with angola as soon as 
possible 
only the united states israel and south africa have not 
recognized angola since its independence from portugal in 1975 
said jackson its time for the us to get up to date 
in an interview later he asked how can we on the one hand 
mediate the agreement between angola cuba and south africa and 
then on the other hand permit ourselves to arm unita and destabilize 
the government 
there should be a joint venture with the us and africa rather 
than a misadventure with south africa 
jackson was ending a fivenation african tour that included 
gabon nigeria zimbabwe and zambia

the chairman of the house armed services 
committee on wednesday proposed pooling money for such strategic 
weapons as star wars and the mx missile to force the incoming bush 
administration and congress to make tough spending decisions 
rep les aspin dwis said that under his 10year plan funds 
for the strategic defense initiative commonly known as star wars 
the trident mx and midgetman missiles and the b52 b1b and b2 
stealth bomber would be placed in a strategic pot 
the annual budget for the pot would remain constant at about 31 
billion the total budget for the strategic programs in 1989 with 
adjustments for inflation aspin said 
the 31 billion budget would be available for all strategic 
weapons with none of it earmarked for any specific weapon he said 
the program would force congress and the new administration to 
decide what specific weapon systems in the pot should be purchased 
and deployed and which should be delayed 
it allows you to make those kind of rational tradeoffs and then 
also to make the political tradeoffs aspin told a national press 
club audience the fact of the matter is youve got constituencies 
for these weapon systems and youve got to finally decide what 
youre going to do with them 
for example aspin mentioned continuing research and development 
funding for the truckmobile singlewarhead midgetman missile 
which many democrats in congress favor but the reagan administration 
proposed scrapping 
to compensate for moving forward on the midgetman aspin 
suggested slowing down stealth bomber purchases for two years and 
limiting spending on star wars to its current annual level of 4 
billion through 1996 
aspin also suggested retiring the poseidon ballistic missile 
submarines and the oldest b52s and using the money saved on 
operating costs for the two programs for earlier deployment of the 
railmobile version of the mx intercontinental ballistic missile 
the stealth bomber or star wars 
the committee chairman said the time has come for democrats and 
republicans white house and congress to put all the weapon systems 
into the pot take a long 10year view work the tradeoffs and 
build a strategic consensus

the republican national committee agreed to 
pick up part of the tab for dan quayles christmas vacation in vail 
colo party officials said wednesday but such expenses as airfare 
lodging and food were paid by the vice presidentelect and his 
family his spokesman said 
the committee issued a statement saying it had agreed to pay up 
to 25000 to cover the cost of two aides and such logistical 
matters as telephone lines and a fourwheeldrive vehicle for the 
skiing vacation 
quayles spokesman david beckwith said that an aide to the vice 
presidentelect acting without authorization had asked the 
committee before the trip to cover up to 65000 of vacation costs 
including quayles personal expenses 
but beckwith said in an interview that quayle had considered the 
request totally out of line 
subsequently beckwith said quayle had scaled back the vacation 
eliminating a planned charter plane scrubbing a stopover in 
tempe ariz for the jan 2 fiesta bowl reducing the size of his 
entourage and paying all his own expenses 
he never asked for a specific amount the spokesman said 
the rnc came up with 25000 
at the white house presidentelect bush said he wasnt troubled 
by a newspaper report of the rnc expenditures when all the facts 
come out said bush therell be no hue and cry 
rnc chairman frank j fahrenkopf jr said in a statement that the 
committee is glad it can help out the republican vice 
presidentelect with what i and the budget committee consider to be 
reasonable expenses 
the committee said in the statement that the relevant bills from 
the skiing trip had not yet come in but it was anticipated they 
would total about 15000 
fahrenkopf and the rnc budget committee on dec 15 authorized 
payment of up to 25000 in committee funds to help defray expenses 
incurred by the vice presidentelect that he would not otherwise 
incur as a private citizen between dec 15 and jan 20 
the washington post wednesday quoted fahrenkopf as calling the 
original proposal a very large amount and not something i 
thought we could do 
bush asked about the post report told reporters 
it didnt trouble me wait until they get the facts and theyll 
be very interesting i think to take care of extra security 
arrangements in a figure thats going to be 10 percent of the figure 
that was originally stated in there lets wait until we get all 
the facts and i think therell be no hue and cry about that 
former vice president walter f mondale recalled in an interview 
that in 1976 after he was elected with jimmy carter he spent a 
week on vacation in the virgin islands 
mondale said that he and his wife joan had paid their own 
expenses but that the tab for the one aide who accompanied them 
probably had been paid out of the transition budget 
no way i could have paid for it said the former vice 
president who had little income outside his senate salary in 1976 
one thing im sure of the democratic national committee never 
gave me 25000 he added laughing about the impoverished state 
of the dnc in those days

the author of a book about life in a new york 
city shelter said wednesday that housing riots may be in americas 
future if state and local governments dont start building 
affordable homes instead of shelters 
were building the biggest permanent poorhouse in the world 
author jonathan kozol said at a news conference to announce model 
state legislation to alleviate homelessness 
i dont know if the governors can act independently to reverse 
the consequences of an 80 percent cut in federal housing funds he 
added if they cannot the shame of new york will soon be the 
shame of a nation 
kozol author of rachel and her children homeless families in 
america said he has visited homeless shelters in 29 american 
cities including new york citys martinique hotel which is profiled 
in the book 
kozol said he senses a growing militancy among homeless people 
who are beginning to organize politically 
i think theres a tide of anger building up among homeless 
people he said 
im afraid that we may soon see housing riots in this country 
kozol praised a demonstration earlier this week by residents of 
the brooklyn arms hotel another new york city homeless shelter the 
residents protested that they are to be moved into city housing 
which they say is even worse than the hotel 
new york city is slated to close its 46 homeless hotels this year 
because if it doesnt it will lose the federal money it has used to 
pay the hotel bills last month it closed the first the 
martinique in midtown manhattan 
as new york city begins at last to renovate real housing 
however the rest of the nation is moving in the opposite 
direction kozol said instead of building housing cities 
everywhere are putting up more shelters 
he called homeless shelters the lowincome housing of the 
1980s and complained that cornell universitys school of hotel 
management is creating a course in shelter management architects 
are starting to design shelters and interior decorators are 
suggesting how to furnish them 
maria foscarinis an attorney for the national coalition for the 
homeless presented model state legislation that her organization 
has drafted to help solve the problem 
homelessness in america is a scandal but it is not a 
mystery she said solutions exist they must be implemented 
the model legislation proposes creating state affordable housing 
trust funds to provide grants or loans to public or private entities 
to develop lowincome housing it would also launch revolving funds 
to provide rent or mortgage relief to people facing the loss of 
their homes the bill would provide emergency services to the 
homeless including temporary shelters health care and job training 
funds for the projects would come from loan repayments and 
penalties as well as interest on real estate taxes in escrow 
accounts tenant security deposits surtaxes on residential or 
commercial sales surcharges on building licenses and permits the 
sale of state or city property real estate and hotel taxes and 
unclaimed property funds 
the coalition honored minnesota gov rudy perpich who was at the 
news conference because his state has already created a housing 
trust fund perpich said minnesota has 31 programs to move the 
homeless into transitional housing

afghan guerrillas said wednesday that 
1000 afghan government troops surrendered after heavy fighting 
washington said the soviets have resumed their pullout despite 
deadlocked peace talks 
leaders of the iranbased afghan resistance accused the soviet 
union which backs the marxist afghan government in kabul of being 
inflexible after talks held in pakistan ran aground 
the troops gave up over the weekend in afghanistans eastern 
nangarhar province fazle akbar director of the proguerrilla 
afghan information and documentation center said wednesday 
akbar also said the kama and gushta district headquarters in the 
province fell this week to the usbacked moslem insurgents called 
mujahedeen or holy warriors six guerrillas were killed in the 
battle for gushta 24 miles west of the pakistan border said akbar 
who reported no other casualties 
soviet and afghan jet fighters have been bombing the kama 
district headquarters about 36 miles west of the pakistan border 
since it fell tuesday guerrilla sources said akbar said guerrillas 
shot down a sovietmade mig 27 bomber near kama with a usmade 
stinger antiaircraft missile 
in washington state department spokesman charles e redman said 
the soviets were continuing the withdrawal they promised to complete 
next month as part of a unmediated agreement reached last year 
we continue to see evidence that the soviets are in the process 
of preparing to withdraw redman said these signs include the 
overland movement north of soviet troops from the kabul garrison in 
recent days and the closure of the soviet military hospital in 
kabul 
his statement apparently was based on western intelligence 
reports and the us official declined to provide further details 
pakistan which hosts more than 3 million afghan war refugees 
has been a staunch supporter of the rebels who have been fighting

to islamabad where he met with afghan guerrillas based in pakistan 
and iran 
the sunni moslem guerrilla leadership headquartered in pakistan 
promised vorontsov the rebels would not attack withdrawing soviet 
troops 
vorontsovs efforts to build an agreement on a broadbased 
government to move into kabul after feb 15 ground to a halt monday

the constitutions ban against cruel and 
inhuman punishment does not shield a retarded killer from execution 
even if the defendant has the mind of a 7yearold the supreme 
court was told wednesday 
assistant attorney general charles a palmer of texas urged the 
justices to permit the execution of johnny paul penry 32 whose 
reasoning capacity has been described as that of a child of 7 
he knew what he was doing palmer said of penry who stabbed 
to death pamela moseley carpenter 22 on oct 15 1979 in 
livingston texas after he raped her palmer recited evidence that 
penry killed the woman to prevent her from identifying him 
ms carpenters brother retired national football league 
placekicker mark moseley was in the courtroom wednesday 
moseley told reporters afterward its been nine years of hell 
for myself and my family its not something anyone should have to 
go through and i feel that if anything good can come out of it that 
may be we can render a decision that will make it not happen to 
someone else 
curtis c mason a lawyer representing penry spent little time 
arguing that all convicted retarded murderers should be spared 
instead mason challenged the texas death penalty law on narrower 
grounds 
mason said the law prevented the jury in determining what 
sentence to impose from giving full consideration to mitigating 
evidence in penrys favor 
penry was abused by his parents attended school only for a few 
days in the first grade and was in and out of mental hospitals while 
growing up near houston 
he is not fully responsible for the way he is today mason 
argued 
but mason said the jury in weighing punishment only was permitted 
to consider whether such mitigating evidence showed that penry had 
acted deliberately with the reasonable expectation that death 
would result 
while the high court might be reluctant to ban the death penalty 
for all retarded killers it still could overturn the texas capital 
punishment law on the narrower grounds cited by mason 
justice sandra day oconnor whose vote could be pivotal in the 
case suggested to palmer that the texas law gives convicted 
murderers limited hope of winning a life prison term as opposed to 
the death penalty 
she questioned whether the state law allows a juror to vote for 
life in prison even if the juror believed the defendant acted with 
diminished moral culpability because of his background 
palmer replied the jury can say my god this boys been 
treated so badly he didnt act deliberately but he acknowledged 
the jury is barred from weighing such evidence to oppose the death 
penalty on other grounds 
the court which heard 60 minutes of arguments is expected to 
announce its decision by july 
the case has attracted considerable attention because of its 
potential impact for all retarded killers 
the clearinghouse on georgia prisons and jails a group opposed 
to capital punishment estimates that from 12 percent to 20 percent 
of the more than 2100 inmates on death rows nationwide function at 
belowaverage intelligence 
ms carpenter was stabbed repeatedly in the chest with a scissors 
she was using to make a halloween costume for her niece she 
provided a description of her assailant before she died 
penry at the time was a parttime delivery man for a local 
appliance store who recently had been paroled from prison where he 
was serving a sentence on a rape conviction 
some justices wednesday expressed doubts that describing someone 
as having the mental capacity of a child has much relevance 
what does it mean to have the mental age of 9 asked justice 
antonin scalia 
palmer said witnesses for penry testified he functioned mentally 
like a 7yearold and socially like a 9yearold 
beyond that i can not help the court palmer said 
if its something we dont understand why allow such 
evidence to be introduced asked justice anthony m kennedy 
the court also is considering this year whether the death penalty 
should be banned for anyone who commits murder while under 18

bulgaria is moving toward free enterprise 
by allowing the formation of private firms and jointstock 
companies but the state will retain partial control over prices and 
production according to a decree published wednesday 
the bulgarian state council decree published in the staterun 
media lacked specifics on the extent of continuing government 
interference in private and corporate management 
privately owned small companies will be allowed to employ up to 
10 people by labor contract the decree said according to a text 
from the state news agency bta 
under the decree foreigners and foreign companies may operate in 
bulgaria with or without bulgarian participation but require 
separate government approval if their share in an enterprise exceeds 
49 percent 
conversely all bulgarian companies stateowned or privately 
owned will be allowed to carry out foreign economic activity 
independently the decree said 
this suggested they can search for their own export markets and 
buy abroad if they have hard currency at their disposal 
while the main form of economic activity is the company the 
decree stipulates that individual citizens and groups of citizens 
may perform economic activity without registering companies bta 
reported 
but the decree also contained a number of provisions for 
continued state control 
the state regulates the economic activity through a system of 
taxes duties and subsidies currency regulations interest 
percentages regulations for labor payment regulations for price 
formation and state orders bta quoted the decree as saying 
under the decree the government also retains a key role in 
setting wages 
in addition the decree stipulates that competent 
authorities along with the companies concerned stipulate 
fulfillment of the state production plan on the basis of mutual 
agreements and state orders 
state orders have been used in the soviet union to continue 
central control over the economy despite new measures that are 
intended to give enterprises broad autonomy 
bureaucrats in central soviet planning organs simply used state 
orders as a replacement for centrally ordained planning targets 
that have been abandoned

a variety of rare plants and animals are toughing 
it out amid the urban jungle in new york citys parks according to 
a group fighting to protect the winged monkey flower smartweed 
dodder and other prized species 
im sure many people will be surprised to know that unique and 
endangered wildlife occurs throughout new york city said j 
martin carovano new york director of the nature conservancy 
the nature conservancy an international nonprofit conservation 
group on wednesday officially teamed up with the citys parks 
department to find and record rare species 
new york became the first city to join private landowners around 
the nation who are working to preserve rare plants and animals on 
their property with the help of the nature conservancys natural 
area registry program 
these natural jewels the winged monkey flower purple 
milkweed and persimmon are rare and endangered species and endure 
despite urban pressures such as ozone and acid deposition said 
marc matsil director of the park departments natural resources 
group 
registering these rare flora affirms our commitment to their 
protection matsil said 
from now on the parks department will take special care of an 
endangered moth known only as amphiboea erepta ryensis found in a 
wetlands meadow near a parking lot at pelham bay park in the bronx 
a rare grassland community at latourette park on staten island 
which also boasts purple milkweed and 19 other plant species in 
parks around the city a rare smartweed dodder grows in queens 
other protected areas include alley pond and cunningham parks in 
queens blue heron pond park in staten island van cortlandt parks 
in the bronx and inwood park in upper manhattan 
the city might not always be able to save parks from development 
matsil said but affiliating with the nature conservancy provides 
a justification to protect the land 
we agree in this registry to monitor and protect these 
species matsil said its a lot more difficult than you think 
the recreation constituency would just as soon fill in the wetlands 
for a ball field 
the announcement was made as representatives from about 65 
conservation groups planned strategies for promoting their cause 
i think the citys physical environment and natural resources 
are extraordinarily important they are priceless said city 
parks commissioner henry stern who discussed the dangers of 
development 
i think the average lay person really does not understand how 
environmental issues affect our lives on a daily basis said us 
rep floyd flake who told the conservationists he was a recent 
convert to their cause

emergency regulations that were in 
force in ethnically divided sri lanka for over 5 years drawing 
fire from world human rights activists lapsed at midnight wednesday 
by presidential proclamation 
a communique issued by the ministry of information said the 
state of emergency in force for well over five years has been 
revoked with effect from midnight today 130 pm est 
the emergency gave police and security forces the right to arrest 
and detain people for long periods to dispose of bodies without 
inquests to search homes without warrants and to override regular 
criminal laws 
president ranasinghe premadasa who took office on jan 2 had 
promised to lift the emergency in an effort to chart a new and more 
peaceful course for this indian ocean island nation wracked by 
ethnic violence since 1983 
a military official however said security forces still will 
have power to arrest and detain suspects without charge and to 
search houses without warrants under an antiterrorism law adopted 
four years before the emergency the official cannot be identified 
under briefing rules 
amnesty international the londonbased human rights group last 
year issued a report alleging abuse and use of torture by sri lankan 
security forces the report which included photographs of men with 
badly burned bodies contained affidavits by people who said they 
were detained or experienced or witnessed torture by members of the 
security forces 
the state of emergency was extended every month since may 1983 
premadasa vowed it would not be renewed on its next expiration date 
jan 15 
on wednesday he told his cabinet the emergency would be lifted 
three days early according to information minister and cabinet 
spokesman festus perera 
perera said the president wanted the emergency lifted quickly so 
political prisoners held without charge could be freed at least 
1800 political prisoners are still detained 
about the time the presidential announcement was made a small 
bomb exploded in a market in the center of colombo injuring two 
people police said they did not know if the bombing was related to 
sri lankas ethnic or political strife or stemmed from a private 
dispute 
sri lanka once famed only for idyllic beaches and glittering 
gemstones exploded into everspiraling violence in 1983 as members 
of the tamil minority launched a separatist movement against the 
sinhalese majority 
since then more than 8500 people mostly sinhalese civilians 
have died in massacres ambushes and guerrilla battles the dead 
include more than 600 indian soldiers part of a peacekeeping force 
sent to sri lanka in july 1987 to try to disarm tamil insurgents 
in addition more than 650 government supporters mostly 
sinhalese were killed by sinhalese extremists who opposed former 
president junius r jayewardenes efforts to make peace with the 
tamils by granting them limited autonomy in the northern and eastern 
provinces 
tamils mostly hindu comprise about 18 percent of sri lankas 16 
million population they say they are discriminated against by the 
buddhist sinhalese majority

up to 10000 soviet jews were allowed to visit 
relatives in israel last year in a wave inspired by soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachevs policy of more openness a jewish representative 
said wednesday 
arrivals began last spring and in 1988 we figure there were 
between 8000 and 10000 who visited said rabbi richard hirsch 
executive director of the world union for progressive judaism a 
private lobby 
he said even more soviet jews could visit this year we 
consider this a harbinger of better times said hirsch who 
stopped in geneva during a trip to meet with swiss jewish leaders 
the soviets many of whom travel on plane tickets paid for by 
relatives in israel have tourist visas and stay one to three 
months he said 
in israel the jewish agency a private group has been 
organizing tours of the country once the soviets arrive in hopes 
that showing israel in a good light will promote more russian 
emigration to the jewish state 
of the 20082 soviet jews allowed to emigrate last year only 7 
percent chose to resettle in israel according to the genevabased 
intergovernmental committee for migration the overall figure was 
the highest since 1980 
hirsch said he expects emigration to rise to 30000 to 40000 
this year

the united states will rotate two aircraft 
carrier battle groups well away from libya and also has canceled 
plans for a missilefiring exercise in the nearby central 
mediterranean sea defense sources said wednesday 
theres no sense being accused of baiting the rattlesnake 
said one official referring to the enigmatic libyan strongman col 
moammar gadhafi 
the moves were described within the pentagon as trying to lower 
tensions between the united states and libya a week after two navy 
jets shot down two libyan mig23s tensions between the two 
countries already were high after washington threatened to attack an 
alleged chemical weapons factory near tripoli 
the united states has said the two f14 fighters were far away 
from libya and acted in selfdefense when they were approached by 
the migs over the mediterranean in a hostile manner 
the defense officials who declined to be identified said 
wednesday the navy battle group led by the carrier uss john f 
kennedy from which the f14s flew would complete its sixmonth 
deployment and be replaced by the carrier theodore roosevelt 
starting late this week in the tyrrhenian sea off the west coast 
of italy 
the roosevelt battle group passed through the strait of gibraltar 
and entered the mediterranean on wednesday 
the sources said it was routine for two carrier groups to operate 
together during a brief overlap period to accomplish a rotation 
and nothing will be different here 
we will have two battle groups together for two or three days 
starting around saturday in the tyrrhenian sea said one navy 
official and they will perform joint operations there 
then the kennedy heads west and home and the teddy roosevelt 
east on patrol and routine operations 
the sources said there had been one change in plans however 
involving the two carriers 
after the rotation the navy had planned a routine missilefiring 
exercise in the central mediterranean north of libya on jan 16 
and 17 the sources explained 
as a routine precaution the navy had issued a notice to 
airman and filed it with air traffic controllers in tripoli who 
have responsibility for that socalled flight information region 
on tuesday libyas ambassador to the un ali a treiki 
disclosed the plns and branded them provocative 
wednesday herbert s okun the secondranking us ambassador 
told reporters the notice to airman had been cancelled another 
us mission officer john kriendler added the whole maneuver had 
been called off 
neither man elaborated on when the exercise had been canceled or 
the reason for the change in plans 
but it would seem logical that were trying to ease the 
tensions a bit observed one pentagon official its not our 
intention to press things with libya right now 
the sources said the missilefiring exercise was to have involved 
some routine practice with surfacetoair missiles and not any 
airtoground missiles of the type that would be used in any attack 
on libya 
our carrier rotation is not going to threaten libya and now 
weve canceled the exercise added one source if anything else 
is going to happen out there it will be because gadhafi once again 
started it

leaders of the nicaraguan contras boasting a 
revised peace proposal and a more flexible attitude urged the 
sandinistas on wednesday to begin another round of peace talks 
the nicaraguan resistance an umbrella group of the rebels has 
proposed opening negotiations with the sandinistas on jan 25 or 
some other date agreed upon in washington 
but so far there has been no official response from the 
nicaraguan government according to adolfo calero a director of the 
resistance 
we are being more flexible in this new position calero said 
wednesday in a news conference at the groups miami headquarters 
a major element of the contras revised position is to extend the 
deadline for compliance by the sandinistas from 70 days to 120 days 
culminating in the rebels giving up their arms and being 
reintegrated into the political and social fabric of nicaragua 
the sandinistas have made promise after promise and never 
comply said another contra leader wilfredo montalvan if the 
sandinistas maintain their intransigence the world will take notice 
that they have no desire to implement democratization and we would 
have no choice but to seek more military aid 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega announced in his yearend 
speech in managua that he would unilaterally extend a ceasefire for 
another month and that nicaragua was ready to look for ways to 
coexist with the enemies of the revolution but he rejected peace 
talks with the contras 
although both sides agreed in march to end offensive operations 
there has been no progress to resolve the 7yearold conflict 
thousands of rebels remain at bases along the honduran border with 
nicaragua 
calero said the latest contra proposal will be sent to central 
american presidents and foreign ministers who can perhaps pressure 
the sandinistas to agree to peace talks with the rebels 
another element of the contra proposal was to seek an independent 
judiciary with professionals to be named in accordance to their 
capacity rather than demand the outright removal of current 
supreme court justices calero said calero did not elaborate 
further on the revised proposal nor was a copy of it provided to 
reporters 
the nicaraguan resistance also denounced the assassination last 
week of commander aureliano a guerrilla physician killed last 
week on the outskirts of tegucigalpa honduras 
its nothing but another step of the sandinista plan to 
decimate the political and military direction of the resistance 
calero said 
calero said the killing of the doctor adan rugama acevedo was 
not an isolated incident he referred to other incidents including 
the murder two weeks ago of a guard at the home of contra leader 
enrique bermudez in tegucigalpa the attempted murder of commander 
douglas last november and a recent bombing at the home of 
another antisandinista 
montalvan said the rebels are encouraged by the election of 
carlos andres perez as president of venezuela he said resistance 
director alfredo cesar left tuesday to meet with perez for 
discussions about the future of nicaragua 
asked about the flood of nicaraguan refugees entering the united 
states with some 100000 to 125000 in the miami area calero said 
the resistance has asked us officials to treat the refugees 
humanely and not deport them

the aflcio on wednesday endorsed washington 
attorney ronald h brown to succeed paul g kirk jr as chairman of 
the democratic national committee despite public support by building 
trades unions for another candidate 
the nations largest labor organization announced the endorsement 
in twosentence statement issued after a 90minute meeting between 
aflcio president lane kirkland and the 16 other members of its 
national political committee 
the statement said the aflcio will be urging members of the 
dnc to vote for brown it did not say why he was selected 
of the 404 votes on the dnc 46 are cast by union 
representatives but labors influence is considered far greater 
than those numbers suggest all five candidates to succeed kirk met 
with labor leaders last week in hopes of securing the endorsement 
brown and richard weiner the michigan state party chairman are 
viewed as the frontrunners to replace kirk brown has the support 
of many national democrats but few if any of them vote and weiner is 
believed to have a considerable base among state party chairmen

honduran president jose azcona called on the 
nicaraguan government wednesday to create conditions for the return 
of the thousands of contra rebels who are camped inside honduran 
territory 
if the sandinista government establishes a free system the 
contras will be able to return and fight in the political arena 
and not in the purely military arena azcona told a news 
conference 
azcona ended a twoday visit here in which he paid a farewell 
call on president reagan and also met with presidentelect bush and 
secretary of statedesignate james baker iii 
azcona gave few clues as to the course bush expects to follow on 
central america after his inauguration he said he asked bush to 
find a solution to the contra problem as quickly as possible 
but he said the principal responsibility for the return of the 
contras to nicaragua rests with the sandinista government 
asked whether bush outlined his views on renewed aid to the 
contras azcona said that issue received only peripheral treatment 
in their discussion no military aid has been sent to the rebels 
since a congressional aid cutoff went into effect last february 
in his public statements bush has been noncommittal on the 
policy he will follow on central america 
he has yet to name his selection for assistant secretary of state 
for latin america considered one of the state departments most 
difficult jobs because of the continuing turmoil in central america 
and the foreign debt crisis that afflicts many hemispheric countries 
one contender for the post is robert helander a new york lawyer 
with long experience in south america including business 
connections with the rockefeller family 
according to state department officials congressional staff 
members with whom helander has spoken in recent days have made it 
clear they hope bush will choose someone else from among the long 
list of candidates for the post 
as of late last week transition team officials said no decision 
had been made the outgoing assistant secretary elliott abrams 
plans to accept a temporary assignment after jan 20 with the 
heritage foundation a conservative research group 
at present there is a stalemate in central america with 
usdonated food and other humanitarian assistance sustaining the 
thousands of rebels and their families who fled nicaragua to camps 
in the border area last year after an interim ceasefire was signed 
between the sandinistas and the contras 
in miami on wednesday contra leaders unveiled a revised 
settlement plan and called on the sandinista government to resume 
peace talks which have been suspended for seven months 
a major element of the revised position is to extend the deadline 
for compliance by the sandinistas from 70 days to 120 days 
culminating in the rebels giving up their arms and being 
reintegrated into the political and social fabric of nicaragua 
we are being more flexible in this new position contra 
leader adolfo calero said at a news conference 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega has said his government is 
prepared to look for ways to coexist with enemies of the 
revolution but rejected new talks with the contras 
honduran officials have been concerned that unless the refugee 
issue is resolved the contras and their families with no other 
place to go may be forced to settle permanently in honduras 
contributing to the countrys already severe social and economic 
problems 
according to some estimates there are about 10000 rebels in the 
border area along with 15000 family members 
there has been little visible international support for a 
honduran call last fall for the formation of an international force 
to evict the rebels from honduras

rival shiite moslem militias battled 
with artillery and rockets in the southern mountains wednesday and 
prosyrian fighters massed for an assault on fundamentalists in a 
strategic stronghold 
also wednesday israeli jets bombed bases of the 
fatahrevolutionary council the radical moslem group led by abu 
nidal in the outskirts of the southern port city of sidon police 
said 
as fighting between mainstream amal militiamen and their cornered 
iranianbacked enemies raged for the fourth day police reported 12 
amal fighters were killed in abortive overnight attacks on jbaa 
the village 10 miles southeast of sidon is the key to a 
triangular bastion where 500 hezbollah fighters are under siege just 
northwest of israels selfproclaimed security zone 
well attack again and again until we uproot those traitors 
from jbaa and the rest of south lebanon said an amal commander in 
the hamlet of kfar filla who gave only his nom de guerre of abu ali 
it will be no easy victory he said 
jbaa is like an eagles nest its difficult to climb the 
slopes to reach it and push the hezbollahis out 
an amal communique said its militiamen seized an underground 
hezbollah arms depot in the village of maroub 13 miles east of the 
southern port of tyre 
the communique said 350 sovietdesigned grad rockets 150 ak47 
assault rifles and two million rounds of ammunition were confiscated 
police in tyre said they could not confirm the claim 
police reported eight people wounded have died in the hospital 
raising the casualty toll since sunday to 107 killed and more than 
220 wounded 
it is the fourth major confrontation between shiite factions 
since april when rivalry to dominate lebanons 1 million shiites 
exploded into warfare some 500 people have been killed and 1500 
wounded since then 
there were no immediate reports of injuries from the israeli air 
raid the first this year police said abu nidals guerrillas turned 
away ambulances saying they had no casualties 
a police spokesman said 1000 amal fighters were regrouping with 
their syriansupplied t54 battle tanks multibarreled rocket 
launchers and howitzers for a major threepronged offensive 
wednesday hezbollah repulsed four overnight assaults on jbaa said 
the spokesman who cannot be named under standing regulations 
amal on monday cut hezbollahs supply lines to its 
ninesquaremile stronghold which stretches southeast from jbaa to 
nearby hamlets of ein bouswar and louwaizeh and the wooded slopes of 
mount safi at the same time they recaptured four of five villages 
taken by hezbollah in fighting that police described as horrific 
they say both sides have committed terrible atrocities with 
hezbollah fighters hacking off heads and limbs of captured amal men 
shiite housewife zainab khater choked back tears wednesday as she 
described watching hezbollah fighters kill a teacher on sunday in 
kfar filla 1 mile west of jbaa 
they shot one of the students in the legs and when the teacher 
rushed to help him a hezbollahi chopped off the teachers head with 
a cutlass she cried 
abu ali said the fighting has changed the future for shiites 
life will neve be as it used to be he told reporters the 
hezbollahis and us used to live together in the same villages before 
this broke out well never be able to coexist 
hezbollah seeks to create an iranianstyle islamic republic in 
lebanon the more secular amal prefers a multisect government with 
moslems and christians sharing power 
the southern fighting raged despite efforts by syrian president 
hafez assad and irans first deputy foreign minister ali mohammad 
besharati who met tuesday to discuss how to end the bloodshed 
beiruts prosyrian ashsharq daily said they agreed to continue 
their efforts 
an iranian embassy source in the syrian capital damascus said 
assad had asserted a ceasefire could be achieved only by 
coordination between syria and iran 
he denied reports that besharati was going to beirut to mediate 
a suggestion amal has rejected 
amal drove hezbollah out of most of the south in a fourday 
battle in april a month later hezbollah ousted amal from most of 
south beirut in a threeweek war 
syria deployed troops in south beirut to quell the fighting but 
violence erupted again in november 
syria the main power broker in lebanon maintains about 40000 
troops in eastern and northern provinces as well as moslem sectors 
of beirut

the department of housing and urban development 
on wednesday released 38 federal properties for use by state and 
local governments and nonprofit organizations to provide shelters 
for the homeless 
the agencys action came in response to a dec 14 order issued by 
us district judge oliver gasch who ordered hud to review more 
than 300 properties in the general services administration inventory 
to determine their suitability for use by the homeless 
the list of 17 buildings and 21 land sites determined suitable by 
the agency includes property in 23 states and puerto rico 
todays action brings to 148 the number of properties 65 
buildings and 83 land sites in gsas inventory that hud had judged 
suitable and completes the agencys review hud said 
hud had said earlier that 110 other gsa properties met its 
minimum requirements for physical structure available utilities and 
accessibility by road 
state and local governments and nonprofit groups may submit 
applications to use the properties to gsa and the department of 
health and human services which will oversee the process by which 
the properties are made available 
its a grudging and very small step by hud to implement the 
federal statute and i think that theres an enormous potential under 
the law said maria foscanis counsel to the national coalition 
for the homeless the federal government is a major property 
holder and given a goodfaith effort a lot more can be done she 
added 
hud said it is also reviewing more than 1600 other properties 
owned by federal agencies in accordance with a 1987 law the agency 
said that review would be completed by the end of february

the federal reserve board on wednesday proposed 
new rules requiring lenders to provide home equity loan borrowers 
with more information about the cost of such loans 
in general lenders would have to provide potential borrowers 
with a written explanation of the terms and conditions of the loan 
at the time of loan application and before any nonrefundable fee is 
collected 
for applications taken over the telephone lenders would have 
three days to supply the required information 
the disclosures must include a full explanation of how the 
interest rate and monthly payments might change and the 
circumstances under which immediate repayment of the loan could be 
demanded 
congress has prohibited lenders from unilaterally changing the 
terms of the loan after it has been taken out the federal reserve 
is proposing to allow changes such as providing a lower monthly 
payment over a longer term provided the borrower agrees to the 
changes in writing 
lenders offering variablerate loans would be forbidden to base 
the rate on an index that is under their control such as the banks 
own prime rate the fed said about 26 percent of home equity lenders 
would be affected by this provision 
the board is allowing 60 days for public comment on the rules 
which are required by legislation that congress enacted in november 
the fed had been working on a rule since december 1987 but held off 
on enacting it while congress debated the legislation 
home equity loans have mushroomed in popularity since passage of 
the 1986 tax act which phased out the deductibility of interest on 
most consumer loans except loans secured by homes 
according to the federal reserve staff about 57 percent of all 
homeowners roughly 33 million families have home equity loan 
accounts totaling more than 50 billion 
the staff said consumers have used the loans conservatively it 
said about 075 percent of the borrowers were behind in their 
payments compared with a delinquency rate three to four times 
higher for other kinds of consumer borrowing such as auto loans 
credit cards and personal loans 
consumer advocates have been wary of the loans even though they 
often have lower rates because borrowers can lose their homes if 
they cant repay

the vietnamese government has told the united 
states it will return the suspected remains of 25 americans killed 
in the vietnam war and also let five us teams of experts in the 
country for a search mission the pentagon said wednesday 
the repatriation of the 25 remains will occur jan 23 with an 
american cargo plane flying to hanoi and transporting the remains to 
the us armys central identification laboratory in honolulu 
hawaii the pentagon said 
prior to that starting jan 14 five teams of us technical 
experts will arrive in hanoi to work with vietnamese counterparts 
during the fourth 10day joint mission to investigate and survey 
incidents involving americans missing in vietnam the pentagon 
said 
the us government is pleased that vietnam has agreed to 
allow five american teams in the country instead of the four teams 
allowed on previous missions the pentagon added 
the us delegation will be composed of two investigation 
teams two excavation teams and a forensic team they will be joined 
by counterparts from the vietnamese office for seeking missing 
persons 
the announcement of the repatriation comes less than a month 
after vietnam transferred the largest single group of remains ever 
to the united states since the wars end 38 individuals 
the largest previous repatriation which occurred in april 1988 
totaled 27 individuals 
currently 2383 americans continue to be listed as missing in 
indochina as a result of the vietnam war of whom 1747 are listed 
as missing in either north or south vietnam 
all told the remains of 172 americans have been repatriated to 
the united states from vietnam and subsequently identified by the 
army lab since the end of the war 
the pentagon in its statement wednesday noted the upcoming 
repatriation would be the eighth since a special presidential 
mission was undertaken by retired gen john vessey the retired army 
general went to vietnam at president reagans request in august 1987 
with orders to seek greater cooperation with the vietnamese in 
resolving the cases of missing americans 
the us government appreciates the initiative taken by vietnam 
to repatriate these remains and hopes to continue the increasing 
joint cooperation to resolve this longstanding humanitarian 
issue the pentagon said 
in the past remains repatriated by vietnam have occasionally 
included those of vietnamese individuals as a result the pentagon 
routinely declines to predict whether all repatriated remains can be 
individually identified by the army laboratory in honolulu

among other things sens donald w riegle jr dmich and jake 
garn rutah asked for an analysis of 
the potential strength during an economic downturn of major 
leveraged buyouts or lbos completed in the last five years 
possible management conflicts of interest in the transactions 
whether existing bondholders were treated fairly 
and whether pension funds and banks are in any danger from 
providing loans for the deals

out stockholders and take over the company often lbos are proposed 
by managers seeking to thwart a hostile takeover

the plo won a diplomatic victory wednesday 
when the security council granted it the right to speak directly to 
the council as palestine on the same basis as any un member 
nation 
the united states was the only nation to vote against the move 
britain canada and france abstained while the soviet union china 
finland brazil colombia malaysia algeria ethiopia nepal 
senegal and yugoslavia voted in favor 
in the past the palestine liberation organization had to ask 
another nation to sponsor its right to speak to the council 
organizations must be invited to speak member states may directly 
ask to address the council 
the palestinian delegates will be addressed as palestine as 
they are in the general assembly rather than under their former 
title as the observer mission of the plo 
the plos diplomatic victory came as it pursued the right to 
speak before the council on the us navys downing of two libyan 
military planes last week 
acceptance of the plos bid to address the council directly as 
palestine gave symbolic weight to its claim to represent a 
nation but not formal recognition the security council would have 
to vote to formally admit palestine as a member state 
the united states consequently opposes extending to the plo 
the same rights to participate in the proceedings of the security 
council as if that organization represented a member state of the 
united nations said herbert s okun the secondranking us 
ambassador 
the palestine national council the plos parliamentinexile 
proclaimed an independent palestinian state in november the plo 
says more than 90 countries have recognized that state 
the parliament did not specify the boundaries of the state but 
it roughly encompasses the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
with jerusalem as its declared capital 
in december the general assembly passed a resolution elevating 
the plos status as an organization with observer status to become 
the palestine observer mission a nonvoting member 
the united states and israel voted against the resolution and 44 
nations abstained including the rest of the western bloc 
the elevation in status put palestine in a class with the 
vatican north korea south korea monaco san marino and 
switzerland as nonmember states with permanent observer missions 
western nations contended that the state proclaimed by the plo 
lacks the normal attributes of a nation such as a functioning 
goverment in control of territory and a population within defined 
borders 
one of the general assemblys committees also voted in december 
to let the plo address the general assembly directly instead of 
through intermediaries the right which it now seeks from the 
security council 
on simple procedural matters such as on the plos right to speak 
the five permanent security council members the united states 
soviet union britain france and china do not have veto power 
they can veto substantial political resolutions the other members 
are nonpermanent

a judge wednesday extended for three 
weeks the period in which central american asylumseekers can leave 
southern texas where an immigration policy was blamed for trapping 
hundreds in desperate conditions 
us district judge filemon vela postponed until jan 31 a 
hearing in a lawsuit filed last week against the immigration and 
naturalization service 
the hearing had been scheduled for thursday when a temporary 
restraining order against the ins policy was to expire 
the order issued monday restored the right for asylumseekers to 
travel to us destinations while their cases are resolved a right 
they will retain until the rescheduled hearing 
the order inspired an exodus of hundreds of central americans 
from the lower rio grande valley 
its something fine for us because we can go be with our 
families and here in the valley we dont have anybody said ana 
rodriguez a 23yearold honduran headed for austin where she has 
relatives 
the dec 16 ins policy under fire required asylumseekers to stay 
close to the application center nearest their point of entry while 
their requests are considered many central americans enter the 
united states in southern texas and file their requests at the busy 
center in harlingen 
the policy left rodriguez and other aliens unable to leave the 
area where they resorted to living in primitive camps abandoned 
buildings and church shelters 
many rushed to leave after the judges order and swamped the ins 
office in harlingen to make sure their application papers would be 
processed by thursday 
now we can go and be a little more tranquil about when we 
leave jose narvaez romero 34 of nicaragua said wednesday after 
learning about the postponement 
narvaez said his papers were ready for his trip to a cousins 
home in hollywood calif but he lacked the 79 bus fare he 
planned to wait until his cousin could wire him money on friday 
he and about 150 other central americans slept outside the ins 
office in harlingen to be among the first in line wednesday morning 
crude tents of plastic sheeting were stretched between palm trees in 
a nearby field and the ins provided portable toilets 
virginia kice an ins spokeswoman in harlingen said the office 
on tuesday processed 967 political asylum applications a oneday 
record and was almost as busy wednesday 
she said the agency had asked for the legal extension to prepare

the defense ministry said 
wednesday that aging us shortrange nuclear missiles in west 
germany will have to be replaced in a decision welcome in 
washington but controversial at home 
the united states has lobbied bonn to accept a replacement for 
the 88 lance missile systems targeted at communist east germany and 
czechoslovakia us officials prefer new missiles able to strike 
deeper into warsaw pact countries 
defense minister rupert scholzs comments drew immediate fire 
from the free democrats the governments junior coalition partner 
and from opposition leaders scholz belongs to chancellor helmut 
kohls christian democratic union 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher a free democrat has 
argued that installing new systems could disrupt the positive trend 
in eastwest relations 
polls indicate west germans are regarding moscow with increasing 
favor with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev routinely 
outranking president reagan in popularity 
in an interview released wednesday by the munichbased bunte 
magazine scholz was quoted as saying of the lance missiles you 
are talking about shortrange nuclear weapons there is no way to 
indefinitely get around modernization of these weapons 
defense ministry spokesman werner widder told the associated 
press he could confirm the contents of the bunte interview regarding 
the lance missiles 
he was asked if in fact the word modernization means 
replacing the systems 
thats exactly what it means widder told the ap 
defense experts have said it would make no sense to overhaul the 
present systems the systems able to launch 600 individual missiles 
at their targets in the east will become obsolete by 1995 
widder also said scholz ruled out a zero option for the 
shortrange missiles 
this calls for eliminating a category of nuclear missiles on both 
sides such as that provided under the ussoviet 
intermediaterange missile treaty signed in 1987 
lance missiles have a range of up to 75 miles against them are 
arrayed 1365 modern sovietbuilt shortrange missiles with a range 
of more than 180 miles 
a nato replacement system for lance would probably have a range 
of 240 miles within the 300mile limit specified for shortrange 
missiles 
olaf feldmann the free democrats disarmament expert told 
reporters his party disagreed strongly with scholzs remarks 
he said the soviet superiority cannot be evened out by further 
western armament but rather by disarmament 
egon bahr the disarmament expert for the opposition social 
democrats told reporters scholzs comments left the impression more 
thought was going into armament than into responding to gorbachevs 
missile proposals 
the scholz interview with bunte will appear on the newsstands 
thursday it was provided in advance to other news media

a 21yearold man who kept showing up at the scene 
of fires and offering information about them to authorities has been 
charged with setting four blazes including one that killed four 
people authorities said 
buddy w marts 21 may have started 25 or more fires police 
said 
marts was arrested tuesday and charged with arson and murder in 
the aug 31 fatal fire that also left 31 people homeless and with 
setting three other fires police said 
he was basically a pyromaniac he enjoyed fires he said he set 
them to keep warm but it was august how cold can it be 
detective william barker said wednesday 
the arrest has led authorities to reassess charges against 
another young man who was indicted in one of the nonfatal blazes on 
the basis of information provided by marts 
on wednesday circuit judge michael bolan ordered marts held 
without bail and set jan 25 as the next court date in the case 
said spokeswoman lisa howard of the cook county states attorneys 
office 
detectives in the police departments bomb and arson unit had 
come to know marts when he started offering bits of information 
about fires in his neighborhood 
there was something familiar about the fires detective tim 
omeara said he was at a lot of them his name kept popping up 
too many times 
omeara said marts admitted setting the fatal fire and tells 
us he needs a lot of help 
earlier police reported that marts often would call the fire 
department or people in the building to alert them to blazes he set 
but detective wayne micek who investigated the case said that 
wasnt so 
ive never seen anybody that perfectly fits the definition of a 
pyromania micek said but he was never hospitalized for mental 
illness and wasnt on any medication 
marts one of nine children worked at odd jobs near where he was 
staying lately with relatives said barker he was what we call a 
bustout he added he lived where he could until he outstayed 
his welcome 
marts provided information on a nonfatal fire that led to the 
nov 29 indictment of michael j gillon 21 but last week police 
began to suspect marts knew too much to be only a witness 
authorities are reassessing the charges against gillon said ms 
howard he has been free on bond 
marts motive was simply rash angry expression said chief 
of detectives edward wodnicki when hed have a fight with 
someone hed vent his frustration by setting fires 
the fires were started by lighting piles of trash and many were 
small blazes confined to the garbage omeara said if he would 
see a pile of garbage in an alley something would tell him to set 
it on fire omeara said 
the fatal fire was in a threestory building that contained 
stores and apartments according to omeara marts said he didnt 
know anyone in the building when he set fire to packing materials on 
the first floor 
marts was charged with four counts of firstdegree murder in the 
deaths of kum yi 60 her son hong yi 30 jack kaufman 84 and 
young suk kim 31 nine people were injured and 31 left homeless by

weapons technology learned during its war with iran 
on the sidelines of the international chemical weapons conference

neighbors are lining up in baghdad to learn how to make toxic arms 
one western expert speaking to reporters on condition of 
anonymity said iraq has used them chemical arms for five years 
and has lots of experience with a range of agents and delivery 
systems more even than the united states and soviet union 
some third world countries are going to iraq to learn 
but iraqs foreign minister tarik aziz speaking in english at a 
news conference wednesday declared whatever experience we have 
in this respect we will not spread it to others we are not very 
much fond of exporting our experience in this respect 
iraq is believed to have several plants producing chemical

conflict aziz said our feeling is that iranians are not yet 
ready to accept peace

thailand has forced burmese students to 
return home despite the possibility of detention and harsh treatment 
by the military government amnesty international reported 
thailand forced the repatriation jan 6 of 22 students who fled 
burma after the bloody military coup in september the londonbased 
human rights group said in a statement received by telex wednesday 
at the associated press office in bangkok it was dated tuesday 
thai officials have denied forcing students back across the 
border and burma claims those who return are treated well 
amnesty international said its concern was based on increasing 
evidence that many political prisoners arrested for having been 
actively involved in the marchseptember uprising have been held 
incommunicado without charge or trial since their arrest and that 
some of them have been subjected to torture or other forms of severe 
treatment 
it reported information that thant zin who was repatriated 
last dec 26 with some 80 other students is said to have been 
arrested after arriving in his hometown of mergui in burmas 
southern tenasserim division he has apparently been held 
incommunicado and his current whereabouts are unknown 
among the 22 returned jan 6 amnesty said were sai myon wyn tun 
and kyai moe both 23 who helped lead the august and september 
demonstrations for democracy in their hometown of taunggyi in shan 
state 
amnesty said they were among 36 students of the shan ethnic 
minority rounded up by thai police two weeks ago in mae hong son 
province on the burma border 
they are said to have repeatedly expressed fears for their 
safety and to have petitioned the thai authorities not to be 
returned to burma and eventually went on a hunger strike the 
statement said 
they are understood to have been forced to board a plane from 
tak airport on jan 6 1989 by thai army personnel the 14 
remaining students are believed to be still held in tak airport 
pending similar repatriation 
reporters who accompanied the 22 on the flight from tak to 
rangoon the burmese capital said some expressed concern for their 
safety in burma and distrust of the government some carried 
placards saying we love democracy and human rights 
thousands of students who were at the forefront of a nationwide 
campaign for democracy fled to thai border areas controlled by 
ethnic burmese insurgent groups after gen saw maung the burmese 
military commander seized power sept 18 and his troops killed 
hundreds of unarmed demonstrators thai officials have said about 
7000 young burmese remain 
thailand initially promised the students temporary asylum but 
gen chavalit yongchaiyudh chief of the army reached an agreement 
with saw maung on repatriation when he visited burma on dec 14 two 
processing centers were established in northern tak province and 
north of bangkok 
on tuesday thailands cabinet extended the deadline for students 
to return home to march 31 chavalit has proposed that any who miss 
the deadline be charged with illegal entry and sent back according 
to a report wednesday in the thai newspaper the nation 
in a separate document received wednesday amnesty reported 
allegations that burmese soldiers killed some students who returned 
outside the formal repatriation program other sources have made 
similar charges but their validity cannot be determined 
the 14page report called the 18 september 1988 military 
takeover and its aftermath said 
in one reported instance nine returning students were arrested 
by government troops in the burmese town of kwathaung on 19 
november and taken to a military camp there four were allegedly 
beheaded by soldiers while the five others who had been held managed 
to escape 
in another reported instance 15 university students including 
three women were allegedly executed after they were captured in 
the forest on their way back home from border areas the three 
young women were allegedly gangraped by soldiers

portauprince haiti ap cuban military planes landed here 
wednesday with 234 haitians whose rickety boats apparently sailing 
for florida drifted to cuba a radio station reported 
radio inter an independent station said they included jean 
tatoune who led demonstrations in the northern port of gonaives 
that helped drive dictator jeanclaude duvalier into exile in 
february 1986 
the haitians reached cuba in november and december and were 
returned in two groups wednesday about 5 hours apart met by 
officials of the red cross and haitian immigration the radio said 
tatoune had not been heard from since last summer after telling 
radio stations he was being persecuted by the military and was 
unable to hold a steady job soldiers ransacked his home in a 
gonaives slum during unrest in 1987 
haitians fleeing poverty and political violence normally head for 
florida but tatoune and his companions drifted ashore in cuba 90 
miles west of haiti 
cuba usually shelters and feeds haitian who wind up in its waters 
for several months before either returning them or sending them on 
their way in repaired boats it does not have diplomatic relations 
with haiti or the united states

businessman noah robinson jesse 
jacksons halfbrother pleaded innocent wednesday to charges that 
he ordered members of a chicago gang to kill a former employee here 
in january 1986 
robinson was accompanied by two lawyers and several ministers 
when he entered his plea during a brief arraignment hearing 
robinson has been charged with murder and conspiracy in 
connection with the slaying of leroy hambone barber who once 
worked for robinson in chicago authorities believe robinson hired 
members of the el rukn gang to kill barber after several disputes 
then conspired to kill a witness to the slaying 
a lawyer for robinson criticized extensive security measures 
ordered by circuit judge james moore for robinsons trial which 
begins monday 
the measures are unnecessary and designed to intimidate defense 
witnesses and influence jurors said albert taylor jr one of 
robinsons greenville lawyers 
if you cant get a conviction in the courtroom you can get it 
by creating mass hysteria before you walk in taylor said 
spectators will have to pass through a metal detector before 
entering the courtroom and police sharpshooters may be stationed 
atop the courthouse law enforcement officials said 
officers also plan to watch for unfamiliar faces in the crowd 
said greenville police chief mike bridges and officers have 
received photographs of el rukn gang members who could be in the 
courtroom 
robinson who owns a construction company and several other 
enterprises across the country has maintained that the case is 
politically motivated and that the only state witnesses against him 
are criminals who have been promised lenient sentences in exchange 
for testimony 
although robinson and jackson share relatives in greenville the 
former democratic presidential hopeful has said he has had no recent 
contact with his halfbrother

the bodies of two victims from the 
crash of pan am flight 103 were shipped to the wrong families in the 
united states because of an administrative error scottish 
authorities said wednesday 
one of the families was notified an hour before the funeral was 
scheduled to begin 
john boyd the chief constable for the district said the error 
occurred during forensic examinations of the bodies recovered from 
the scene of the dec 21 crash in which 270 people died 
the two victims were karen hunt 20 of webster ny and mary 
lincoln johnson 25 of wayland mass 
throughout the course of the extensive investigation into the 
tragic disaster the trauma and the stress being experienced by all 
relatives and friends of the victims has been uppermost in the minds 
of all concerned boyd said in a statement released wednesday 
it is unfortunate that this isolated administrative error has 
occurred and further sympathies to the families concerned are 
offered by the authorities he said 
the bodies of the two women were released jan 4 and boyd said 
authorities learned of the apparent error three days later 
the mistake was discovered last week when the medical examiners 
office in rochester ny concluded that the hunt family had not 
received the correct body 
fbi agents notified the johnson family of the mistake just an 
hour before a funeral was scheduled on sunday 
ms hunts father robert hunt said the family planned a prayer 
service but would not bury her until spring when the ground thaws 
ms hunt was returning to new york after completing a semester in 
london as part of a syracuse university program 
ms johnson a graduate of brown university was returning to 
wayland for christmas with her family after spending 14 months 
abroad touring india and teaching english in taiwan 
meanwhile four explosives experts from czechoslovakia arrived in 
london to assist in the investigation 
investigators have concluded that the boeing 747 was brought down 
by a bomb planted in the cargo hold and have said that the 
explosion was consistent with a highperformance plastic explosive 
such as semtex which is manufactured in czechoslovakia

the united states britain and france 
vetoed a security council resolution wednesday criticizing america 
for shooting down two libyan mig23 war planes over the 
mediterranean last week 
the vote on the resolution sponsored by algeria and the other 
nonaligned members of the council was 94 with finland and 
brazil abstaining 
canada joined the other allies in voting against the measure 
the soviet union china ethiopia colombia malaysia algeria 
nepal senegal and yugoslavia voted in favor 
washington says two us navy f14s acted in selfdefense in 
shooting down the two libyan planes during naval maneuvers over 
international waters on jan 4 
as permanent members of the 15nation council any one of the 
negative votes from the united states britain or france was enough 
to kill the resolution 
the vetoed resolution deplores the downing of the two libyan 
reconnaisssance planes and asked the us navy to suspend 
maneuvers off libya 
in washington a pentagon spokesman said wednesday that aerial 
maneuvers scheduled in the area were canceled and he said plans 
were changed to reduce tensions in the region 
herbert s okun the secondranking us ambassador told the 
council before the vote these were not unarmed libyan 
reconnaissance aircraft as this council has been told they were 
highly sophisticated fighter aircraft and we have shown the 
security council and the world photographic proof that they were 
armed 
okun said pilots of the us f14 tomcat fighters exercised their 
right to fire in selfdefense during the encounter a right nations 
possess under the un charter 
us ambassador vernon a walters on friday displayed photographs 
of one of the libyan jets showing shapes resembling missile pods on 
its wings and fuselage 
libyas deputy ambassador ali sunni muntasser said the pictures 
were retouched and that the planes were unarmed reconnaissance 
flights 
britain agreed that the us pilots acted in selfdefense 
british ambassador sir crispin tickell said the resolution was 
couched in the wrong terms and proceeds from wrong assumptions 
canadas ambassador yves fortier said later that the resolution 
contained a onesided account of the incident sentiments echoed 
by frances deputy representative m pierre brochand 
after the vote libyan ambassador ali a treiki told the council 
that in view of the use or rather abuse of the veto power by some 
member states we feel that this council has been actually paralyzed

barbara bush got a tour of her next home 1600 
pennsylvania avenue wednesday and vowed afterwards notto 
change one thing her spokeswoman said 
first lady nancy reagan treated her successor to a 45minute 
afternoon tea and tour of the white house in particular the second 
and third floor areas that will serve as the private residence for 
george bush and his wife after he is inaugurated jan 20 
mrs bushs spokeswoman sondra haley quoted her as saying after 
the private tour its the most beautiful house i have ever seen 
im not going to change one thing 
eight years ago when the nation was in an economic slump mrs 
reagan was criticized for organizing a highpriced redecoration of 
the white house even though the effort was privately financed 
mrs reagan according to her spokeswoman elaine crispen 
expressed confidence in mrs bush saying i know she will take 
good care of this wonderful old house 
traditionally the outgoing president leaves the mansion to 
attend the inaugural while the new president and his family enter 
the white house after the ceremonies 
the domestic staff at the white house sees to it during the 
festivities that the personal belongings of the outgoing president 
and his wife are packed and removed at the same time the new 
families items are brought in for them 
mrs reagan however had most of their furniture and personal 
items transferred to their new home in los angeles last october 
president reagan and his wife spent nine nights at the 25 million 
belair estate over the christmas holidays 
mrs crispen said that even though mrs bush as the wife of the 
vice president has often visited the executive mansion there were 
many rooms that she hadnt seen such as the kitchen on the second 
floor and the laundry on the third floor 
they just kind of went around looking and seeing what its all 
about mrs crispen said 
mrs crispen said mrs bush will most probably arrange for the 
placement of her own larger pieces of furniture after the inaugural 
at the moment the private rooms are decorated with items from 
the store of furniture china and artworks that are available for 
use in the executive mansion 
ms healey said mrs bush is currently overseeing the packing at 
the vice presidents mansion and she expected the first couple to 
bring many things that had graced their home on the grounds of the 
naval observatory 
all their sitting room living room and bedroom furniture is 
coming her needlepoint rug many of their personal things she 
said 
mrs bush crafted the rug over an 8year period ms haley said 
the spokeswoman said she was certain mrs bush would also make 
use of the many touches of china they owned the items of 
furniture and artwork the couple bought during bushs tenure as the 
first american envoy to peking

a conference of 149 nations pledged wednesday not to 
use chemical weapons and to work to eliminate them but its final 
declaration was tempered by political compromise after five days of 
bickering 
the united states and other western nations that have nuclear 
arms succeeded in blocking efforts led by arab states to link the 
control of chemical and nuclear weapons in the declaration which is 
not legally binding 
the united states the most fervent opponent of the arab 
position said it was gratified by the results of the fiveday 
international conference 
the us objectives for the conference were to focus worldwide 
attention on the problems of chemical weapons use and chemical 
weapons proliferation and help put a stop to the use of these 
weapons in violation of international law said state department 
spokesman charles redman in washington 
but maj gen william f burns head of the us disarmement 
agency and leader of the us delegation indicated the declaration 
fell short of expectations 
we believe the goals here have been accomplished burns told 
a news conference saying the discussion had heightened the 
concerns of the world about chemical arms but he added 
if the united states had written this statement which we did 
not it might have been stronger 
burns said the united states would have liked to see explicit 
language on sanctions a word not mentioned in the final 
declaration 
the united states indicated in a statement it also would have 
liked language directly addressing the need for export controls on 
chemical products used to make toxic weapons 
the objective of the conference was to reaffirm the 1925 geneva 
protocol banning chemical weapons and give new life to languishing 
negotiations in geneva for a total ban on development use 
production and stocking of chemical arms 
french foreign minister roland dumas who presided over the 
conference said at least 10 more nations had agreed to sign the 
geneva protocol bringing the number of adherents to nearly 130 
the sixpoint declaration issued at the conference also affirmed 
the un role in investigating chemical weapons use and called for a 
strengthening of existing procedures at the united nations in 
dealing with such use a reference to enacting sanctions 
in a compromise to appease arab states the declaration stressed 
the need to secure general and complete disarmament a passage 
from a 1978 un document but the declaration did not mention the 
word nuclear 
arab nations had said they wanted to reserve the right to possess 
chemical weapons to counter what they claim is a nuclear threat from 
israel 
earlier wednesday iraqi vice premier tarik aziz said the arab 
nations would concede their demand in order to get a consensus and 
would pursue their objective at negotiations in geneva 
iraqs use of chemical weapons in its eightyear war with iran 
provided a somber backdrop for the conference and iran succeeded in 
getting a reference to recent violations of the protocol in the 
declaration 
the iranian delegation voiced a reservation after the declaration 
was approved saying the document fell short of a categorical 
condemnation of past use of chemical weapons iran had been pressing 
for language that would indicate iraqi use of chemicals against iran 
was the raison detre for this conference 
work continued until the last minute to find wording that would 
satisfy all 149 delegations to the conference 
the participating states solemnly affirm their commitments not 
to use chemical weapons and condemn such use the declaration 
said they recall their serious concern at recent violations as 
established and condemned by the competent organs of the united 
nations 
the participating states stress the necessity of concluding at 
an early date a convention on the prohibition of the development 
production stockpiling and use of all chemical weapons and on 
their destruction this convention shall be global and comprehensive 
and effectively verifiable 
dumas said the unanimous approval of the final declaration was 
tantamount to saying the whole international community has taken a 
posture against chemical weapons 
the soviet union which also rejected the arab demand for linkage 
of chemical and nuclear weapons said it was also satisfied although 
it would have preferred more energetic words aimed at the 
conclusion of talks in geneva 
the declaration is an expression of political will with no legal 
weight nor enforcement powers 
after two days it became clear that arab nations had formed a 
front against israel which they claim has nuclear weapons israel 
has never responded directly to allegations it has such weapons 
other countries led by the united states argued that chemical 
weapons unlike nuclear arms are not a deterrent 
both chemical and nuclear arms are considered weapons of mass 
destruction 
about 20 nations have chemical weapons capabilities according to 
estimates but the soviet union and the united states are the only 
two countries to admit possessing them

president reagan used wednesday nights 
farewell address to warn that parents need to do a better job of 
teaching their children about americas heritage saying that 
wellgrounded patriotism is no longer the style 
in an apparent reference to dwight d eisenhowers farewell 
warning in january 1961 about an emerging militaryindustrial 
complex reagan talked of a great tradition of warnings in 
presidential farewells and ive got one thats been on my mind for 
some time 
he said that while he was proud about a resurgence of national 
pride during his eight years as president it wont count for much 
and it wont last unless its grounded in thoughtfulness and 
knowledge 
now were about to enter the 90s and some things have 
changed reagan said younger parents arent sure that an 
unambivalent appreciation of america is the right thing to teach 
modern children 
if we forget what we did we wont know who we are 
reagan said that americans who are 35 or older grew up in a 
different america where patriotic values were taught by parents 
relatives neighbors and friends and if all else failed you could 
get a sense of patriotism from the popular culture 
as as for those who create the popular culture wellgrounded 
patriotism is no longer the style he said 
our spirit is back reagan said but we havent 
reinstitutionalized it weve got to do a better job of getting 
across that america is freedom freedom of speech freedom of 
religion freedom of enterprise its fragile it needs 
protection

a group of soviet scientists on wednesday called on 
the government to halt construction of a nuclear power plant in the 
crimea a popular resort area they say is prone to powerful 
earthquakes 
the 10 scientists in a letter published by the communist party 
daily pravda said the plants first reactor capable of generating 
1 million kilowatts is projected to begin operating sometime this 
year 
construction of the plant began in 1980 and it is designed to 
withstand earthquakes that measure 7 on the 12point soviet scale 
the scientists said however that a government commission has 
concluded that its site on the crimeas kerch peninsula is prone to 
force9 quakes in comparison last months armenian earthquake was 
rated a force8 quake by the soviets 
the quake measured 69 on the richter scale a gauge of energy 
released by an earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded 
on a seismograph 
experts have also found the crimean plant to be located almost 
directly atop an underground dome where high pressures could cause 
deformation of the earths surface and eruptions of volcanic mud and 
gas the scientists said 
tuesday night the soviet television news program vreyma 
announced that armenias sole nuclear power station which is built 
on a geological fault in the southern republic will be shut down by 
march 
officials have said the armenian plant was shaken but not damaged 
by the dec 7 quake that killed at least 25000 people in northwest 
armenia but the quake apparently accelerated the governments 
decision to shut down the plant 
since the april 1986 chernobyl nuclear plant accident in the 
ukraine the soviets have moved away from a previously professed 
faith in nuclear power as a completely safe energy source and public 
opposition has grown 
nikolai lukonin the soviet nuclear power minister announced 
dec 23 that six projects to build nuclear plants or add more 
reactors at exisiting stations had been scrapped because of 
earthquake danger or tougher standards imposed after the chernobyl 
accident 
the crimean power plant was not among those mentioned by lukonin 
the crimea has some of the soviet unions most popular beach 
resorts it is home to 2 million people and welcomes at least as 
many vacationers annually the scientists said 
the scientists who included a yanshin a member of the 
prestigious soviet academy of sciences said they decided to go 
public with experts conclusions on the crimean site because of 
many examples in the past where government agencies had either 
silenced or twisted the conclusions of scientists and gone ahead 
with building projects 
now the last word rests with the council of ministers of the 
ussr which must decide the fate of this construction project 
which was begun without the necessary scientific survey the 10 
scientists said 
the 1986 chernobyl accident the worst in the history of nuclear 
power killed at least 31 people and released a cloud of radiation 
that eventually circled the globe

president jose napoleon duarte 
on wednesday announced cancellation of next weeks central american 
summit and suggested it take place the second week of february 
costa rican president oscar arias on friday suggested the summit 
originally scheduled for jan 1516 in san salvador be postponed to 
allow presidentelect george bush time to create a central american 
policy bush is inaugurated jan 20 
the costa rican government also said it and nicaragua honduras 
el salvador and guatemala needed more time to resolve existing 
differences on implementing a regional peace plan 
duarte said of the reasons behind arias proposal some are 
valid and others are subjective but he said the bush inauguration 
isnt a basis for delaying the summit 
maybe the most valid reason of all is that a summit isnt 
possible if there isnt a preliminary process to review the 
results of the august 1987 peace plan he said a technical 
committee meeting scheduled for tuesday in the nicaraguan capital of 
managua was canceled 
the presidents were to have discussed the stalled peace plan they 
signed in guatemala that calls in part for democratic guarantees 
political amnesties and an end to civil wars in el salvador 
nicaragua and guatemala 
the salvadoran president ruled out an informal meeting of the 
regions leaders during the inauguration of presidentelect carlos 
andres perez of venezuela on feb 2 saying he will not attend 
because of ongoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer 
duarte has been diagnosed as having terminal liver cancer

authorities questioned the badly injured pilot of a 
crashed boeing 737 wednesday but revealed no clues as to why the 
jets undamaged right engine was shut down well before the crash 
while the other engine burned 
the civil aviation authority meanwhile ordered increased 
inspections on 37 airplanes with cfm56 engines the type on the 
midland airways jet that crashed sunday investigators said much 
more work was needed to pinpoint the cause of the crash which 
killed 44 people and injured 82 
the government also ordered immediate checks of engine monitoring 
systems on similar aircraft to verify that they correctly indicate 
right and left prompting speculation that a malfunctioning alarm 
system could have misled the flight crew 
freddie yetman technical secretary of the british airline pilots 
association said this showed that investigators must have some 
suspicion of these circuits 
in the united states the federal aviation administration ordered 
inspections of 300 boeing 737s for possible crosswiring of engine 
warning systems 
us media reported that the crew of the jet shut down the wrong 
engine and britains tabloid newspapers drew similar conclusions in 
banner headlines 
error on the flight deck the today newspaper said fatal 
error said the daily star pilot shut off the wrong engine 
said the sun 
the transport department said that evidence obtained early in 
the investigation indicated both of the planes engines might 
have suffered a related failure and that possibility was still 
being examined 
the statement from the departments air accidents investigation 
branch also confirmed that the airplanes left engine caught fire 
and the right engine was shut down and that pilot kevin hunt had 
told ground control the fire was in the right engine 
the reasons for shutting down the engine are not yet clear and 
are still under investigation it said 
the jet en route from london to belfast with 126 people aboard 
plunged into an embankment a halfmile short of the runway at east 
midlands airport in central england as it was trying to make an 
emergency landing sunday night 
hunt whose back and legs were broken in the crash was 
interviewed for 45 minutes at the intensive care unit of leicester 
royal infirmary said the hospitals deputy general manager carol 
henshall 
mrs henshall said some of the wilder headlines had been kept 
from hunt but friends and colleagues had told him of the news 
reports 
in the united states nbc news quoted unidentified us 
government sources as saying the planes flight recorders which 
monitor engine performance and the pilots conversations indicate 
the crew shut down the wrong engine the trouble was in one they 
shut down the other 
but the network said investigators had yet to detemine whether 
faulty instruments contributed to the crash 
the washington post quoting unidentified accident investigators 
said the crew believed they were making a routine oneengine 
emergency landing and apparently thought they had solved the 
problem when they shut down an engine 
spokesmen for both the faa and the national transportation board 
said they knew of no information reaching us officials about the 
flight recorders contents 
the airplanes two black boxes the cockpit voice recorder 
and digital flight data recorder are being examined at the 
governments laboratory in farnborough outside london 
according to court documents and federal officials in america 
the fbi is investigating a general electric co admission that test 
records may have been falsified at a factory which made parts for 
the cfm56 engine that failed here 
the seattle factory also made a check and flow valve for the f404 
engine aboard the navys fa18 fighter ge spokesman richard kennedy 
said wednesday a letter from a ge attorney last year said test 
records may have been falsified for the fighter plane valves 
the timer valve made by ge for the cfm56 engine could not have 
caused the turbine to fail even if the valve malfunctioned kennedy 
said 
the plane took off at 752 pm sunday government sources 
speaking on condition of anonymity said hunt reported at 806 pm 
that i have an engine on fire then at 814 pm the sources 
said he told traffic control i am shutting down the starboard 
right engine 
the plane crashed 12 minutes later at 826 pm 
the civil aviation authority said that on the advice of 
investigators it was issuing new instructions for the inspection 
and monitoring of boeing 737300 boeing 737400 and airbus a320 
airplanes all of which use the cfm56 engine 
the engines are made jointly by usbased ge and a french 
company snecma 
boeing commercial airplanes spokesman craig martin said in 
seattle of the faas inspection order we certainly believe its a 
prudent measure to go out and check to make sure theres nothing 
wrong with the fleet but certainly this precautionary measure does 
not imply there has been any cause identified for the crash

two pamunkey indian sisters are asking a 
tribal council to change a tribal law that bans them from living on 
the reservation they grew up on because they married outside the 
tribe 
kim taylor and cam porter whose grandfather was chief of the 
pamunkey for 42 years want to find land on the reservation to build 
homes and raise families but because the 23yearold twins recently 
married white men theyve been asked to leave the 1250acre 
reservation nestled in a bend of the pamunkey river in southern king 
william county 
thats the way the law reads said william swift eagle 
miles the current pamunkey chief who favors changing the law 
i want to live here mrs taylor said in a recent interview 
its a special place for me ive got a lot of family and were 
all real close part of me belongs here this is my land really my 
land 
this is where i grew up added her sister this is home 
the sisters have crusaded to have the tribal law changed 
gathering signatures from pamunkey women from as far away as 
philadelphia 
according to tribal law pamunkey women who marry outside the 
tribe give up their right to live on the reservation men in the 
tribe never lose that right white women may live on the reservation 
with their husbands although like the pamunkey women they have no 
say in the tribes government 
only about 60 people live on the reservation one of two 
remaining in virginia all but a handful are retired and the elders 
worry about the tribes future 
despite financial incentives such as paying no property tax and 
not having to buy the land one lives on its hard to keep young 
people on the reservation the nearest town is 15 miles away and 
its 40 miles to richmond where about a dozen residents commute to 
work daily 
miles said the law banning white husbands is having a drastic 
effect on the reservation population the mattaponi indians who 
live on a much smaller reservation nearby have a similar rule on 
the books but it is not strictly enforced said mattaponi chief 
walter custalow and the reservation is crowded with young families 
one problem miles said is that most of the older pamunkey had 
daughters and most of those girls married outside the tribe 
whether out of preference or necessity 
they want you to marry a pamunkey indian said mrs taylor 
thats impossible theyre all girls or theyre my cousins 
miles said he doesnt know how councilmen will vote at thurday 
nights meeting i think i can convince them he said i have 
some pretty strong arguments we have some oldtimers here and i 
think it will be close 
the sisters say theyve been been aware of the law since they 
were children if i dated a white guy i used to say i cant 
marry you cause i want to live on the reservation said mrs 
porter but you cant help who you fall in love with i just 
figured wed change the law 
mrs taylor said many of their female relatives who married 
outside the tribe would come back to the reservation if the law were 
changed she said the two have collected about 20 signatures on 
their petition and that the drive was going slowly because many 
tribe members are farflung and some of the older indians oppose the 
change 
however the sisters cause has won the support of a few 
influential tribe members including miles and their grandfather 
the former chief 
i think they realize they dont have much choice mrs taylor 
said there will be no reservation 
miles says he will bring up the issue at the next meeting of the 
tribe later this month he expects opposition from the oldtimers 
but thinks theyll come around eventually if only out of necessity 
if we dont change that were going to disappear he said

president reagan bade the nation a sentimental 
and contented farewell wednesday night asserting he had forged a 
satisfying new closeness with the soviet union and saying overall 
of his eight years in office we meant to change a nation and 
instead we changed a world 
speaking nine days before his retirement to california reagan 
said the fact is parting is such sweet sorrow he reflected on 
the modern presidency youre always somewhat apart you spend 
alot of time going by too fast in a car someone else is driving 
in an oval office speech delivered to a primetime broadcast 
audience he said his chief regret was the mammoth budget deficit 
that accumulated after he pushed through the biggest tax cut in 
american history 
reagan addressed the nation from his oval office desk his left 
hand in a splint and swathed in bandages the president had surgery 
over the weekend to straighten a curvature of his left ring finger 
that had been caused by an ailment known as dupuytrens contracture 
reagan said his chief triumphs were the nations economic 
recovery and the recovery of our morale and americas position 
as a world leader he said his tenure had stood for freedom and 
proved that democracy the profoundly good is also profoundly 
productive 
he said nothing is less free than pure communism and yet we 
have over the past few years forged a satisfying new closeness 
with the soviet union his relationship with mikhail gorbachev 
blossomed in the course of over five meetings during reagans second 
term 
my view is that president gorbachev is different from previous 
soviet leaders reagan said i think he knows some of the things 
wrong with his society and is trying to fix them 
his recommendation for the future was simple what it all boils 
down to is this i want the new closeness to continue he followed 
up with his traditional warnings trust but verify watch 
closely and dont be afraid to see what you see 
the national debt almost tripled in reagans term and he ran up 
the biggest budget deficits in history his final budget proposal 
released earlier this week for the 1990 fiscal year starting oct 1 
projects a deficit of 925 billion 
action is still needed he said if were to finish the 
job reagans regiments will have to become bushs brigade 
he called himself a citizen politician who sought office in 
part to put up my hand an say stop to big government and added 
i think we have stopped alot of what needed stopping 
he said he had changed american through the tax cuts which he 
said gave people greater incentive to work 
he said his tenure had changed the world with a treaty to reduce 
superpower nuclear stockpiles moreover he said his term had seen 
the regional conficts that rock the globe begin to recede he 
cited afghanistan the middle east and angola 
he also said countries across the globe are turning to free 
markets and free speech 
of the disappointments during his tenure reagan said little 
nothing of the barracks bombing that took several hundred marine 
lives in beirut nothing of the americans taken hostage and still 
held captive nothing of the trade deficits or the scandals that 
tarnished his administration 
nothing of the decision to sell arms to iran and use the proceeds 
to fund the contra rebels in nicaragua the contras subject of so 
many reagan speeches were not mentioned 
citing a great tradition of warnings in presidential 
farewells reagan offered one thats been on my mind for some 
time 
he said an eradication of the american memory of the nations 
history could result ultimately in an erosion of the american 
spirit 
weve got to do a better job of getting across that america is 
freedom freedom of speech freedom of religion freedom of 
enterprise and freedom is special and rare its fragile it needs 
protection 
reagan said even other countries had to acknowledge his success 
in bringing america out of an economic and morale slump 
countries across the globe are turning to free markets and free 
speech and turning away from the ideologies of the past for them 
the great rediscovery of the 1980s has been that lo and behold the 
moral way of government is the practical way of government 
reagan summarized what he said his presidency had proven once 
you begin a great movement theres no telling where it will end we 
meant to change a nation and instead we changed a world 
he said in the 1970s the united states entered into detente based 
on soviet promises not actions but this time so far its 
different he said citing gorbachevs push toward economic and 
political reform within the soviet union and his promised withdrawal 
from afghanistan 
the roughly 20minute speech was reagans 34th from the oval 
office 
in using television for the address reagan chose his favorite 
medium and also borrowed a page from the presidential books of 
democrat jimmy carter in 1981 and republican dwight d eisenhower in 
1961 
the speech was heavily studded with reagans reflections on his 
presidency on a fasttrack existence that often had him going by 
too fast in a car someone else was driving and seeing the people 
through tinted glass 
and so many times i wanted to stop and reach out from behind 
the glass and connect reagan said 
reagan said he likes to stand at a window looking toward virginia 
and providing a rich view of the washington monument and mall and 
said that i have been thinking a bit at that window 
the way i see it there were two great triumphs two things 
that im proudest of one is the economic recovery the other is 
the recovery of our morale america is respected again in the world 
and looked to for leadership 
ive been asked if i have any regrets i do the deficit is 
one he said ive been talking a great deal about that lately 
but tonight isnt for arguments and im going to hold my tongue 
reagan will continue being visible with an appearance at a 
military ceremony in his honor at andrews air force md on thursday 
and his visit friday night to a meeting of the knights of malta a 
roman catholic civic organization in new york 
the white house has not divulged reagans inaugurationweek 
schedule although the president and his wife nancy evidently will 
leave the capital immediately after presidentelect bush is sworn in 
on jan 20 
the speech came during a week in which the president was winding 
up his official business including the submission of a proposed 
fiscal 1990 budget to congress and taking part in sentimental 
goingaway ceremonies 
after he posed with his cabinet for the official class picture 
reagan was given the chair that he used for eight years in the 
cabinet room the presentation was made by samuel pierce the only 
remaining member of the original reagan cabinet formed in 1981

president mikhail s gorbachev wont be out kissing 
babies to win election to the new congress of peoples deputies 
because the communist party nominated him to a guaranteed seat 
the official news agency tass reported wednesday that gorbachev 
was one of the 100 people nominated by the partys central committee 
on tuesday for its 100 guaranteed seats the new 2250member 
congress will elect a working parliament and the nations president 
from among its members 
gorbachev the communist party leader was named president by the 
old parliment in october he is widely expected to be elected to 
that position by the new one 
the political reform law passed in november promised 
multiplecandidate elections would be allowed but the communist 
party example of one seat one candidate dampens the prospects for 
widespread contention 
tass also reported wednesday that the soviet peace foundation and 
eight other official peace organizations nominated 17 candidates for 
the congress including journalist fyodor burlatsky and former world 
chess champion anatoly karpov 
tass did not say if the peace organizations also have guaranteed 
seats or if they nominated more candidates than positions 
onethird of the 2250 deputies will be elected by organizations 
such as the communist party and trade unions the other twothirds 
will be elected by the public on march 26

israeli troops will never be able to halt the 
palestinian uprising and a political solution is needed the armys 
top officer was quoted wednesday as saying another general resigned 
and said the violence is making soldiers malicious 
troops shot and wounded nine arabs on wednesday in clashes that 
have occurred almost daily since the 13monthold revolt began to 
protest israeli occupation of the gaza strip and west bank 
also the army said israeli warplanes bombed a base north of the 
lebanese port of sidon belonging to an extremist palestinian 
guerrilla faction led by abu nidal 
the fatah revolutionary council led by abu nidal has been 
blamed for numerous attacks against israel and western european 
countries the army said the raid was part of an ongoing attempt to 
preempt attacks against israel 
meanwhile debate continues to heat up over the armys role in 
the occupied lands fifteen israelis have been killed in the 
uprising that began dec 8 1987 at least 349 palestinians have 
been killed most by army gunfire 
lt gen dan shomron the army chief of staff was quoted 
wednesday as saying that troops have been unable to halt the 
rebellion and that a political solution was needed 
there is no such thing as eradicating the uprising because in 
essence it expresses the struggle of nationalism the jerusalem 
post quoted shomron as telling a closed session of parliaments 
defense and foreign affairs committee on tuesday 
shomron also said that since november fatah and other factions 
under the control of plo chief yasser arafat had halted hostile 
operations against israel in the west bank and gaza strip the 
newspaper reported 
the remarks sparked loud debate among committee members the post 
said 
former army chief of staff rafael eitan said collective 
punishment punishing a group of palestinians for an act by an 
individual or smaller group still was appropriate the post 
reported 
collective punishment merely prompts more civilians to join the 
ranks of the protesters countered micha harish of the 
leftleaning labor party 
also wednesday maj gen menachem einan who is leaving his job 
as the armys logistics chief was quoted in the daily maariv as 
saying he was very worried about the level of morality of israels 
soldiers in the territories 
we are making them face provocations that inspire maliciousness 
all too quickly he said 
an army spokesman said einan had been scheduled to retire friday 
for a civilian job and that his resignation was unrelated to the 
criticism 
the military command refused an associated press request 
wednesday to interview einan it did not immediately respond to his 
published remarks 
in the interview einan traced his misgivings about the 
territories to the israeli governments handling of the 1982 lebanon 
invasion which escalated into a threeyear conflict instead of a 
limited campaign as initially planned 
my big lesson is that perhaps there are times when the fighting 
military echelons cannot accept to the last letter the instructions 
given by the political echelons he said 
in another development a senior army officer in the gaza strip 
held a firstever meeting with the head of the moslem extremist 
group hamas the daily haaretz reported 
sheikh ahmed yassin reportedly discussed political and economic 
topics affecting gaza with brig gen aryeh shiffman who heads 
israels military administration of gaza the newspaper said 
most of the nine palestinians wounded in wednesdays clashes were 
in the gaza strips nusseirat refugee camp where troops shot and 
wounded five palestinian youths during confrontations with 
stonethrowers arab doctors said 
the army said it was checking the reported casualties 
israeli newspapers reported that the army indicted three 
palestinians on murder charges for allegedly throwing three 
firebombs at an israeli passenger bus oct 30 in the west bank city 
of jericho 
five israelis including a soldier a woman and her three small 
children were killed in the attack the palestinians were 
identified as being in their early 20s 
in another development prime minister yitzhak shamir said 
wednesday that the head of israels mossad intelligence agency was 
being replaced as part of a scheduled rotation and not because of 
media criticism of the service 
in an unprecedented decision tuesday the supreme court overruled 
the military censor and gave a tel aviv newspaper permission to 
print an article that suggests the mossad chief was responsible for 
several recent failures of the agency 
all articles concerning israels security must be submitted to 
the censor the mossad chiefs name and details of his activities 
traditionally are banned from publication

president reagans farewell address to the 
nation was a unapologetic celebration of administration successes 
and a declaration of victory that ignored the failures and 
frustrations suffered over the last eight years 
leaving office with high popularity ratings reagan seemed 
determined to prove he was unbowed by the demands and pressures of 
an office that has beaten down some of his predecessors 
it was vintage reagan he was irrepressibly sunny and optimistic 
determined to look on the bright side and to remain silent about the 
sore spots if he wished hed done something differently he wasnt 
talking about it wednesday night 
my friends we did it we werent just marking time we made a 
difference reagan said in his nationally broadcast address 
we meant to change a nation and instead we changed a world 
the biggest accomplishments he said were the economic recovery 
and the creation of 19 million new jobs over the last eight years 
moreover he cited the fact that america is respected again in the 
world and looked to for leadership 
regrets well yes but reagan mentioned only one the deficit 
and he brushed it aside in just two sentences 
george bush must be wishing he could dispose of the towering 
problem so easily instead the deficit and the mountain of debt 
that nearly tripled during reagans term will handcuff bush 
financially when he takes office on jan 20 
the irancontra affair that engulfed reagans presidency did not 
get a mention nor did defensecontractor scandals the american 
hostages in lebanon the ethical lapses of some members of his 
administration the homeless and the nightmare of the terrorist 
bombing that killed 241 american servicemen in beirut 
the contra rebels in nicaragua once a subject of consuming 
passion of the reagan white house and the topic of countless 
speeches were overlooked in the presidents upbeat glance at world 
affairs he once said he wanted the sandinistas to say uncle 
they have not 
he said the superpowers have begun to reduce stockpiles of 
nuclear weapons and said that hope for even more progress is 
bright in addition the persian gulf is no longer a war zone 
the soviets are leaving afghanistan the vietnamese are preparing to 
pull out of cambodies and an americanmediated accord will soon send 
50000 cuban troops home from angola 
basking in the warmth of his meetings with soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev reagan said he had forged a satisfying new closeness 
with moscow 
he told an incident to make a point about mans yearning for 
freedom but in a way seemed to reveal a naive understanding about 
the vast security precautions that are always taken on his behalf 
reagan recalled that he strolled with nancy through a shopping 
district of moscow during last years summit as russian citizens 
rushed to meet him reagan said soviet kgb agents suddenly pushed 
and shoved at the crowd underscoring he said that a communist 
government views freedom and human rights differently than americans 
the fact is american secret service agents accompanying reagan 
were shoving at the crowd too secret service agents do that in 
america too when theyre trying to protect a president 
even after two terms in the white house reagan cast himself as a 
washington outsider a citizen politician who came to the 
capital to stop uncle sam from imposing more rules and regulations 
and to curb governments appetite for taxes 
the onetime hollywood actor said he didnt earn the nickname of 
great communicator because of his style or his script but 
because of the content of his ideas and he made clear that his 
ideas were exactly what the country had needed 
dismissing the objections of his critics reagan said the fact 
is what they called radical was really right what they called 
dangerous was just desperately needed 
once again reagan spoke romantically about his vision of a 
shining city on a hill a metaphor for a country living in 
harmony and peace and prosperity 
and how stands the city on this winter night reagan asked 
rhetorically more prosperous more secure and happier than it was 
eight years ago

president prepares for next weeks inauguration 
the only major post still unfilled by bush is the drug czar 
to oversee the nations fight against illegal drugs 
earlier wednesday bush defended his decision to attend japanese 
emperor hirohitos funeral next month against criticism from those 
who still resent hirohitos world war ii role 
im doing whats right bush told reporters president reagan

bush in remarks to reporters before a meeting with black college 
presidents said his appointment of an energy secretary the last 
vacancy in his cabinet will be coming up pretty soon

plan to send prince philip as its representative to the funeral of 
its former wartime adversary

had no qualms about criticism he may get from fellow world war ii 
veterans 
bush a former navy aviator whose plane was shot down by the 
japanese in the pacific in 1944 said i think i speak from a

into the meeting with black educators and fielding several 
questions

bennett proposed last year the education department under cavazos

who asked bush to see to it that institutions are not penalized 
s dallas simmons president of virginia union university said 
bush and cavazos indicated this would not be the last meeting but 
only the first of many during the years to come he added i am 
leaving the meeting feeling very very good

twenty percent of all american workers are now 
employed by companies that test for drug use but only one employee 
in 100 actually is tested in a 12month period the government 
reported today 
ninetyone percent of employers have neither testing nor 
counseling programs the labor department said but larger companies 
are much more likely to have such programs 
job applicants are far more likely to be tested than employees 
the department said it billed its survey of 7500 establishments as 
the most extensive study to date on drug testing in the workplace 
among establishments with testing programs about twothirds 
tested only those workers suspected of drug use while onefourth 
had programs that subjected all employees to possible testing

antismoking campaigns have been most 
successful in getting white men to put out their cigarettes and a 
new government report calls for more efforts aimed at women 
children minorities and high school dropouts who are not quitting 
as quickly 
the annual report issued by surgeon general c everett koop on 
the 25th anniversary of the governments first such report says the 
proportion of american smokers has declined from 40 percent of the 
population in 1965 to 29 percent in 1987 
these changes represent nothing less than a revolution in 
behavior koop said in the report thanks to the remarkable 
progress of the past 25 years we can dare to envision a smokefree 
society 
however he said smokers are disproportionately found in 
groups that are harder to reach and this disparity may increase 
over time greater effort and resources will need to be devoted to 
achieve equivalent reductions in smoking among those whose behavior 
has survived strong countervailing pressures

in proportion to their numbers episcopalians as 
usual hold far more than their share of seats in the new congress 
and next friday for the 12th time in us history an episcopalian 
george bush occupies the white house 
there have been more presidents of that denomination than any 
other although it rates only seventh in size its 28 million 
members make up only about l2 percent of the population 
but it holds about 12 percent of the seats in the new 101st 
congress 63 of 535 seats in the house and senate in the senate 
alone episcopalians are an even bigger proportion 20 members or a 
fifth of the l00 senators more than any other denomination 
although several others are much larger 
episcopal prominence in politics began in early america with the 
nations first president george washington belonging to that 
church as have 10 other presidents most recently franklin d 
roosevelt and gerald ford 
other episcopalians among the founders and early presidents were 
james madison who originally planned to become a minister but 
switched to politics and thomas jefferson who in his spare time 
produced the jefferson bible version 
it retains the ethical teachings but eliminates miracles 
causing unitarians to claim him although that denomination wasnt 
formed until the year before he died in 1826 long after his 
presidency 
protestants along with episcopalians have always predominated 
in congress and still do with 334 of 535 seats but the number of 
roman catholics has swelled over the last two decades now totalling 
139 seats 
that is more than any other single denomination although 
slipping slightly by two from the previous congress methodists hold 
the second largest number of seats 75 down by one while 
episcopalians increased three to 63 
altogether about 52 percent of congress members belong to those 
three traditions 
baptists made up the fourth biggest denominational bloc 55 of 
them gaining one for the first time they surpassed 
presbyterians whose number dropped four to 53 
the preliminary figures on affiliations of the new congress were 
compiled by rob boston of americans united for the separation of 
church and state in washington 
in sixth place were jews who gained two members to a total of 
39 while the nextplaced lutherans also gained two to a total of 
25 the christian church disciples of christ gained one to total 
four 
other numerically unchanged contingents included 
united church of christ 13 mormons 11 unitarian 
universalists 10 eastern orthodox seven churches of christ 
five christian scientists two and several other protestant groups 
with one each 
twentythree congress members up one were listed only as 
protestant with no specified denomination while five members one 
more than previously were listed as having no religious affiliation 
bush a lifelong episcopalian belongs to st martins episcopal 
church in houston and attends various episcopal churches in 
washington including the national cathedral where he will take 
part in a postinaugural service jan 22 
of the 39 presidents who have preceded him there have been 
besides the 11 other episcopalians the following 
six presbyterians four methodists three congregationalists now 
united church of christ three baptists three members of the 
christian church disciples of christ two dutch reformed two 
quakers two unitarian universalists and one roman catholic john 
f kennedy

life was stunningly refuted by a recent study 
it found that religious bodies led the field in charitable work 
for others surpassing foundations and corporations 
brian oconnell president of independent sector a coalition of 
660 corporate foundation and voluntary philanthrophic organizations 
which sponsored the study said 
we realize more than we had expected how much the organized 
neighborliness of religious organizations means to the kind of 
caring society we are 
the study found that almost half of the 4l4 billion contributed 
in 1986 to religion was used to support services to others the rest 
spent on internal activities such as worship and religious education 
pollster george gallup whose organization gathered the data 
said it showed churches are among our most costeffective 
institutions in philanthropic work with minimal administrative

the new year ushers in a new wildfire 
season an unwelcome thought to the residents of this small montana 
tourist town on the northeastern corner of yellowstone national park 
for two months last summer the citizens of cooke city and its 
tiny suburb silver gate were showcased on the nightly tv news and 
splashed across the front pages of the nations newspapers as forest 
fires threatened to burn them out 
pinched between the storm creek and clovermist blazes an 
estimated 150 seasonal residents and dozens of tourists were 
evacuated twice while hundreds of firefighters faced down walls of 
flame which threatened annihilation eventually millions of 
dollars thousands of man hours and an early autumn snowfall saved 
the towns 
no structures were lost within the towns boundaries but seven 
residences and five outbuildings were destroyed in the area 
one wag even changed the sign leading into town by adding a 
single letter rechristening it cooked city 
their economically critical summer tourist season a bust and the 
hunting season crippled the folks of silver gate and cooke city 
straggled home in midseptember to pick up the pieces 
the first thing most people around here did was go on 
vacation said patti smith owner with her husband bob of the 
bearclaw service and cabins a gas station and small motel the 
fire really took a toll on a lot of folks 
business was way down this fall because we didnt have the 
hunters but we got a lot of curious weekenders from cody and 
billings who wanted to see how bad it was 
the smiths who own the only photocopy machine for 30 miles in 
every direction found their small gas station and convenience store 
a mecca during the fires the us forest service which coordinated 
some of its firefighting efforts from cooke city set up shop near 
the photocopy machine and everybody who had information or was 
seeking some crammed into the smiths log cabin office 
it was crazy for a while said mrs smith 33 we got sent 
out twice the first time i grabbed all the photo albums but forgot 
our wedding pictures the second time the sirens went off and we had 
to leave my parents had just arrived from north platte neb so we 
all went to red lodge mont got nice motel rooms and crashed 
winter now cloaks cooke city and silver gate and only about 70 
yearround residents remain to weather the belowzero months the 
only grocery store is on its winter schedule open just friday 
through monday and many curio shops are shut up tight but the 
bearclaw cabins and most of the other motels are open for winter 
sports enthusiasts 
although postmistress vicky menuey keeps the office open five 
days a week mail only arrives to zip code 59020 from the outside 
world on mondays wednesdays and fridays 
nearly four feet of snow has piled up against the smiths cabins 
and thats just the way i like it exulted mrs smith no 
smoke no flames and plenty of tourists 
its snowmobiling season now and clubs from as far away as 
canada and illinois are booked into cooke citys motels to take 
advantage of the beautiful scenery and 80 miles of trails in the 
area the state pays bob smith 34 to groom the trails because of 
the heavy day use smith works mostly at night in subzero 
temperatures his wife keeps track of him by walkietalkie 
patti smith relishes the winter months because she gets caught up 
on chores chats with her neighbors and watches videos the hottest 
tape in cooke city this winter is three men and a baby for 
which theres a waiting list this winter mrs smith also has a new 
project 
im going to do my scrapbooks she said hauling out from 
underneath a counter a huge cardboard box overflowing with newspaper 
clippings and official fire bulletins among them a firefighters 
newsletter the griz gazette purporting to have spotted elvis 
presley on the fire line 
ive got the whole story right here in this box said the 
amateur historian of course a lot of it is wrong 
like nearly everybody else in cooke city and silver gate mrs 
smith says she never wants to go through another summer like the 
last one 
nationwide it was the second worst wildfire season since the 
government started keeping records although the 59 million acres 
burned in 1988 did not match the 28 million acres destroyed in 1926 
the 5838 million spent to fight 75000 fires set a record 
because of the unprecedented fire season which burned nearly 15 
million acres in the greater yellowstone ecosystem including 
705000 acres within the national park mrs smith and her friends 
and neighbors worry about whats happening underneath the blanket of 
snow this winter 
are there still smoldering embers out there deep in the roots 
of the trees wondered mrs smith could the fires survive the 
winter and pick up and come at us again 
park officials and fire experts have asked themselves the same 
questions 
rod norum a fire behavior analyst with the national park 
service said he would not be surprised if pockets of fire are found 
in the greater yellowstone area come spring 
its not the sort of thing to be concerned about it would only 
be a matter of curiosity and interest because the fires are still 
under suppression orders and they would be mopped up and put out 
immediately im sure said norum who is based at the boise 
interagency fire center in idaho 
in his 18 years of studying wildfires norum has come across 
several incidents where wildfires buried themselves in the roots of 
trees and grasses and smoldered all winter only to pop up through 
the snow in the spring 
when the snow melts in may the yellowstone country will provide 
an answer to a question troubling lots of people whose lives were 
changed by the wildfires of 88

the creator of abcs heartbeat wanted gail 
strickland to play a doctors wife but she opted for the role of a 
lesbian nursepractitioner 
i heard of the project from sara davidson who was the writer 
and creator said strickland who stars in this series set in a 
womens medical clinic 
weve been friends for a long time she said she wrote it with 
me in mind for one of the characters but as i read the script i 
found the character didnt appeal to me it was the charming 
sophisticated wife of a doctor and id played that kind of role too 
many times 
but the role of the nursepractitioner marilyn mcgrath 
appealed to me very much she was funny and wise and had a way of 
dealing with things i found interesting 
the character was also gay and stricklands portrayal beginning 
with the series brief run last year is the first openly lesbian 
character on series television 
it wasnt the fact that she was gay that i found interesting 
said strickland it was the other aspects of the character her 
sense of humor was very much like my own after i read the script i 
asked for the role i didnt give much consideration to the fact 
that she was gay 
apparently a lot of other people have she said a number of 
viewers letters have complained about the characters sexual 
preference but an equal number have praised her portrayal 
mcgrath is a fertility expert and one of the founders of the 
clinic womens medical arts the series also stars carmen 
argenziano laura johnson darrell larson ben masters kate 
mulgrew julie ronnie and lynn whitfield 
marilyn has a longterm relationship that was explored the 
first season strickland said she also has an estranged 
daughter from an earlier marriage the character was able to say a 
few things about homosexuality that dont usually get said on the 
air 
shes accepted and respected by her peers it hasnt been an 
issue in the first six episodes we did whats fun about the show is 
that were all different weve all been defined in our goals and 
how we relate to each other the friendships weve developed with 
the other actors ive noticed are showing up in the scripts as 
friendships between the characters 
strickland grew up in birmingham ala and went to school at 
florida state university at tallahassee my mother was determined 
i would only go to college somewhere she could drive to she said 
id wanted to go to sarah lawrence or northwestern but i had a 
good time 
i didnt get into drama until my junior year i was in 
gymnastics and played the clown to amuse the audience while the 
equipment was being set up i developed a comedy routine that put my 
life into jeopardy because i wasnt very good at gymnastics i 
couldnt do a back flip off a trampoline for instance so they had 
to catch me i did a balancing act where they also had to catch me 
the audience thought it was just part of the act 
she learned to enjoy working before an audience but after 
graduation she took off for europe and worked her way around the 
continent as a bartender a governess and an extra in a spanish 
movie 
in new york she studied at the neighborhood playhouse and earned 
her keep by doing commercials and soap operas 
the first show i did when i moved to los angeles was the mary 
tyler moore show she said i thought they were all like that 
where the actor could make contributions and was welcomed and 
appreciated i havent felt that much lately as a guest star except 
on murder she wrote and thats because of angela lansbury i 
hope we on heartbeat treat people the same way 
she previously starred in two other series abcs the 
insiders and the syndicated comedy what a country

harlan county an appalachian coal town passed 
by in the economic recovery of the reagan years hopes to move 
beyond the stereotypes of poverty and strike violence when its 
awardwinning boys choir performs at the inauguration of george bush 
this week 
we know how people perceive us and we hope our offering will 
allow us an opportunity to change that choir director david 
davies said adding that he thought its only natural for 
outsiders to buy the stereotypes about appalachia 
the community of 3000 has reacted with pride to the 76member 
groups selection last month to be the lead choir for the 
inauguration 
its been one of the biggest and best things thats happened to 
the community said harlan county judgeexecutive delzinna 
belcher the choir is one of the good traditions thats just 
particular to harlan county 
some people are wary that publicity about the choir may be 
accompanied by yet another wave of stories about the troubles in the 
region 
frankly im sick and tired of people who are not from this 
area making a twohour visit or a fourday goodwill tour and then 
thinking theyre experts about our area and our culture ms 
belcher said 
but she is among the first to acknowledge the county faces some 
tough problems 
unemployment remains in double digits blamed on overproduction 
and increased automation in the coal industry poor roads and 
utility services hamper economic development efforts 
the community has been plagued by the lingering memory of 
violence associated with coal strikes in the 1930s and 1940s that 
earned the town the name bloody harlan 
ms belcher said she hoped the choir which represents 25 percent 
of the male students in the harlan city school district would 
provide people across the country a positive image of the area that 
might help offset the negatives 
the bush family selected the choir from a list of several groups 
that were candidates for the honor said mike ruehlig a staff 
member for a congressional inaugural committee 
davies said the choir would sing this is my country on the 
platform on the front lawn of the us capitol minutes before bush 
is sworn in as the nations 41st president 
the choir director said he hoped people watching the inauguration 
would be impressed with the groups musical abilities and 
discipline he said the inaugural performance would stand out in the 
choirs 24year history which has included international trips and 
numerous competition trophies 
roy allison an insurance agent who is the choirs business 
coordinator said the group is raising the 25000 needed for the 
trip through donations 
television crews have been in harlan for the past two weeks and 
one morning network television show plans to feature the choir 
during a program on the morning of the inauguration 
were getting used to the tv cameras said choir member 
jeremy disney 12 it will help us this might get us ready for 
when we get to washington

when they do their income tax returns this year 
quite a few americans might be prompted to think about changing 
their borrowing habits 
time was when just about every cent of interest you paid was a 
simple deductible expense and the deduction helped reduce the cost 
of credit but those days are gone 
in the aftermath of tax reform there are five distinct 
categories of interest expense only one of which qualifies as fully 
deductible without limits 
and two people borrowing identical amounts of money at the same 
nominal interest rate can wind up paying substantially different 
aftertax amounts for their loans 
credit card payments auto loans and other familiar types of 
credit used by individuals to buy goods and services come under the 
heading of consumer interest 
for 1988 you can deduct 40 percent of the consumer interest you 
paid that drops to 20 percent in 1989 10 percent in 1990 and 
nothing in subsequent years 
if you borrow to finance an investment by contrast the interest 
remains deductible in amounts that dont exceed your investment 
income by more than 2000 for 1989 
if you borrow against your primary or a second residence 
mortgage interest is still fully deductible up to the point where 
the amount of the loan reaches 1 million similarly interest can 
be deducted on home equity loans of up to 100000 
then theres category no 4 passive activity interest which 
arises when you borrow to finance an investment such as a limited 
partnership that operates a business in which you arent an active 
participant 
this kind of interest was a prime target in the legislative 
campaign against tax shelters rather than a deduction it is 
deemed part of the businesss costs when its income or loss is 
calculated 
the only type of interest still deductible without exception is 
interest paid by a trade or business 
clearly the least attractive type of interest expense is 
consumer interest says william brennan editor of the financial 
planning reporter newsletter at the accounting firm of ernst amp 
whinney in washington 
if you have any spare cash consider paying off consumer debt 
immediately 
people who want or need to borrow brennan argues should look 
first to home equity loans if they have access to them since home 
equity loan interest still qualifies for a deduction 
the main knock on home equity loans is that they expose a 
precious asset to the threat of foreclosure if you cant keep up 
timely payments on what you borrow also all home equity loans are 
not created equal some are loaded down with fees and charges that 
make them more costly than they look 
still says brennan the deduction can mean a significant 
savings on a consumer loan at 12 percent interest a person in the 
28 percent bracket pays an effective aftertax rate of 1133 percent 
with a home equity loan at the same 12 percent that person pays 
an effective aftertax rate of 864 percent 
suppose you lead a fairly complicated financial life and have 
interest payments that could conceivably fall into any one of 
several categories how do you tell what is what 
thats most easily accomplished if you keep borrowed funds in an 
account separate from your other money if you put what you borrow 
into say your regular checking account you may well have trouble 
establishing that you are paying anything other than consumer 
interest 
observes brennan you can overcome this treatment by separating 
borrowed funds from personal savings and then using the borrowed 
funds for purchases other than consumer items

thank heavens ford saw fit to tweak the styling of its ford tempo 
and mercury topaz cars they have gone from blimpy jelly beans to 
sleeker more neatly packaged exteriors 
judging from last years sales american car buyers liked the 
change too topaz sales in 1988 rose 45 percent from 1987 levels 
to about 93000 said company analyst ray windecker 
company spokesman jim trainor said topaz sales of more than 7600 
last november set a monthly record the topaz sister car the ford 
tempo also was up with sales of about 280000 in 1988 a 29 
percent increase from 1987 
windecker and trainor agreed the strong boost came mainly from 
the new appearance starting in the 1988 model year the vehicles

the 1989 mercury topaz ls test car was a sturdy compact that took 
little time getting used to the topaz hasnt changed much since its 
introduction four years ago so there wasnt an array of distracting 
newfangled gadgets the topaz was just a car you could get into and 
drive away 
it offers sensible daytoday transportation dont look for 
excitement 
the 23liter fourcylinder engine in the topaz since its 
introduction seemed underpowered at times coupled with a 
threespeed automatic transmission it developed a maximum 100 
horsepower at 4400 rpm 
but passing on the highway produced a loud whine under the topaz 
hood and a sluggish increase in speed speeding up in the city for 
lane changes or whatever also was a bit disappointing 
still trainor noted that more power is not necessarily what the 
average topaz buyer wants and the recent sales figures bear him 
out price may be a factor in the topaz purchase 
the base price of the test topaz was a little over 11000 
compared with a base price of 14101 for the lowend sable 
the topaz is between the mercury tracer and the sable in the mix 
of cars in lincolnmercury dealerships trainor said adding that 
many buyers are looking for a good family car and thus opt for the 
topaz over the small tracer 
topaz competitors include the pontiac grand am and chevrolet 
corsica which start at around 11000 windecker said the topaz has 
an overall family image with the median age of buyers at 444 
years seventythree percent are married 50 percent are women 21 
percent are in professionaltechnical occupations 12 percent are 
office workers and 18 percent are retired median income is 33000 
annually 
besides the engine power i had one other note about the topaz 
ford has installed automatic lap belts on the front seats though i 
have driven other ford cars with the belts they seemed particularly 
annoying in the topaz perhaps because the cloth seats also were 
impossible to slide out of as a result i had to carefully plan how 
to get out so my purse wouldnt keep getting hung up in the belts 
which automatically move towards the body when the key is turned in 
the ignition and automatically move away when the door is opened 
i dont even want to describe the scene when i lifted a small bag 
of groceries out of the front seat i finally started putting my 
purse in the back seat and fetching it through a rear door after i 
was out of the car 
i also had a passenger who unfamiliar with the belts was hit in 
the face by a belt when i started the car the automatic shoulder 
belts by the way still require manual attachment of the lap belts 
suspension in the topaz was decent for a family car 
there was lots of room in the trunk though you have to lift 
items up and over the car body in back before getting them into the 
trunk 
seats were comfortable and rear legroom was adequate 
the allwheeldrive option 915 is chosen by just a small 
percentage of topaz buyers trainor said but it really helped the 
test car shine activated by a button above the rearview mirror it 
performed well and was comforting on slick snowcovered roads 
consumer reports magazine says early models of the topaz 1984 
and 1985 ranked much worse than average in trouble reported by 
owners but later models 1986 and 1987 improved to average

after eight years of ronald reagans presence 
in the white house the united states is enjoying prosperity but 
not without worries 
the governments debt has climbed from less than 1 trillion when 
reagan took office to more than 26 trillion most americans pay 
less income tax than when reagan took office but the overall 
federal burden including social security taxes rose for the 
poorest citizens despite his pledge to get government off the backs 
of the citizens reagan made few inroads in his war against 
government regulation 
reagan gave mixed signals on environmental controls his record 
ending largely in stalemate the defense establishment grew 
enormously and the reagan era ended the dream of home ownership for 
millions in one important area reagans full impact is yet to be 
felt the supreme court and the federal judiciary 
associated press reporters who have covered these areas sum up 
the reagan impact 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when reagan leaves office the us economy will be in its 75th 
month of expansion a peacetime record with the oncefamous 
misery index far below where it was in jimmy carters last days 
in office 
when reagan was sworn in the country was in the grips of its 
worst economic predicament since the great depression a 
longsimmering bout of inflation fueled by successive oil shocks 
that had sent consumer prices rising at doubledigit rates 
the misery index a number concocted by adding the inflation 
rate and the unemployment rate climbed to a peak of 206 at the 
end of the carter years as reagan leaves office the index is down 
below 10 percent with the jobless rate at a 14year low of 53 
percent and inflation hovering slightly above 4 percent about where 
it has been for seven years 
reagan had a lot of help in the inflation fight from former 
federal reserve chairman paul volcker but he supported volcker even 
in the dark days of 198182 when the feds credittightening moves 
plunged the country into its worst recession since the 1930s 
after the downturn the economy embarked on an expansion that has 
lasted more than four times longer than the typical recovery 
creating more than 18 million jobs in the process 
critics contend that the rich received a disproportionate share 
of the reagan era prosperity 
while the administration points to statistics showing that median 
family incomes after adjusting for inflation climbed to a record 
high of 30853 the critics note that the 135 percent poverty rate 
was higher than the levels recorded in the carter ford and nixon 
administrations 
the most lasting monuments of the reagan economic policies may be 
the twin debt mountains built by a near tripling in the national 
debt and the countrys slide from being the worlds largest creditor 
nation to the worlds largest debtor nation a development that 
occurred because of the huge trade deficits 
it is those debt burdens critics say that will haunt george 
bush and seriously constrain his maneuvering room during his 
presidency

most americans at all economic levels are paying less income tax 
than they were when reagan took office but the total federal burden 
on lowerincome families has increased because of rising social 
security taxes 
the largest reductions between 1980 and 1988 will be for the 1 
percent of families with the highest incomes says the nonpartisan 
congressional budget office in summing up tax changes of the reagan 
era 
two farreaching tax laws were enacted the 1981 acrosstheboard 
tax cut for individuals and corporations and the 1986 overhaul that 
slashed rates to the lowest levels in a halfcentury eliminating or 
reducing several deductions and shifting a big part of the tax 
burden from individuals to business 
in between and since those landmark acts congress and reagan 
agreed to more than a dozen tax increases most of them designed 
chiefly to reduce the federal deficit which took back much of the 
earlier tax cuts social security taxes also went up 
in estimating effects of all those tax changes cbo divided 
taxpayers into 10 groups deciles according to size of family 
income the first decil covered the 10 percent of families whose 
incomes were lowest the 10th decile covered the 10 percent with the 
highest incomes here are some cbo findings 
the effective individual income tax rate dropped for all 10 
groups from 1980 to 1988 but social insurance taxes mainly social 
security rose for all 10 the income tax cut was not enough to 
offset the social security tax increase for the poorer half of 
families earning less than 23540 
the poorest decile under 3685 income spent 96 percent of 
their income on federal taxes in 1988 up from 66 percent in 1980 
those in the sixth decile averaging 29660 paid 209 percent 
down from 214 percent the richest 10 percent averaging 125800 
income paid 25 percent in 1988 and 271 percent in 1980 
american families on average in 1988 paid 227 percent of their 
income in federal taxes including social security excise taxes and 
all other federal taxes down from 233 percent in 1980 income 
taxes alone averaged 104 percent down from 123 percent 
the share of total federal taxes paid by the richest 10 percent 
of families rose by as much as 15 percentage points from 1980 to 
1988 but their share of pretax income increased nearly twice as 
much

from higher salaries to stepped up weapons production to a search 
for a star wars space shield reagan left an indelible mark on 
americas military establishment 
he also left a simmering fraud scandal that may tarnish 
reputations in government and industry and reams of weaponbuying 
orders without any money to back them up 
by all pentagon measures the navy marine corps army and air 
force are better prepared to fight than they were eight years ago 
the services have record percentages of high school graduates 
manning the front lines and new tanks guns planes and ships for 
them to use 
such gains were not made cheaply 
so great was reagans military buildup that even allowing for 
congressional cuts over the last four years annual pentagon 
spending in terms of budget authority climbed from 2138 billion in 
fiscal 1982 to 2908 billion in fiscal 1989 
more significantly the administration devoted a grand total of 
213 trillion to the defense department from the first full year of 
reagans presidency through fiscal 1989 which began last oct 1 
that total which does not include energy department spending to 
produce nuclear warheads easily represents the largest peacetime 
military buildup in american history in fact the buildup 
approximates the amount of money spent on us military forces in 
the 10 years of american involvement in vietnam 
the 213 trillion of the reagan years equals 239 trillion when 
expressed in constant 1989 dollars taking inflation into account 
from fiscal 1964 to fiscal 1973 the period of us action in 
vietnam the pentagon received 246 trillion in 1989 dollars 
thanks to economic growth the money spent on national defense 
has declined in recent years as a percentageof the gross national 
product it now stands at 59 percent 
former defense secretary caspar w weinberger and current defense 
chief frank c carlucci argue theres no link between the 
governments booming deficit and the pentagon budget 
the money spent on the military has actually declined in recent 
years as a percentage of the federal budget its now 269 percent 
meaning the deficit is being driven by increases in domestic 
spending and entitlement programs they claim 
congress however appears loathe to cut deeply into domestic 
programs and with soviet arms control proposals raising new hopes 
for progress and presidentelect bush leaning toward zero growth in 
the next pentagon budget the reagan buildup may be done for good

the reagan years brought an end to the dream of home ownership 
for millions of americans and the nightmare of homelessness for 
hundreds of thousands 
meanwhile home values are skyrocketing in most areas with the 
median price ranging from 66700 in the midwest to 142500 in the 
northeast as reagan leaves office interest rates are also edging 
up those trends have ended the house hunt for increasing numbers of 
wouldbe home buyers 
huds spending authority has declined by more than half during 
reagans presidency but housing and urban development secretary 
samuel r pierce jr who was the longestserving and among the 
leastvisible of reagans cabinet members boasted that his agency 
was taking care of more people by far with much less money 
among programs pushed by hud are housing vouchers that allow poor 
people to live anywhere rather than only in public housing and 
reverse mortgages that would give houserich and cashpoor 
elderly people income from the future sale of their homes without 
having to give them up 
but critics said cuts in housing and antipoverty programs in 
reagans presidency combined with economic policies favoring the 
welloff have caused a crisis that poses a major challenge for the 
new administration 
in the cities soup lines are getting longer and shelters more 
crowded estimates of the number of homeless range from 250000 to 3 
million homelessness also has spread to the countryside where 
thousands live in everything from chicken coops to caves 
the new homeless are not the drug abusers and mentally retarded 
who have long slept in new york subways or on washington street 
grates but young men with minimumwage jobs and single women with 
children

the reagan administration did much to focus attention on the 
nations drug problem and devoted substantial resources to combating 
it but the results of all that effort are mixed 
the federal government is seizing more narcotics and making more 
arrests than ever before but drug use continues at high levels 
across the country 
a report issued by the justice department showed that in new york 
city during a threemonth voluntary survey in mid1988 90 percent 
of the men arrested tested positive for a drug up 11 percentage 
points from the previous year in los angeles 77 percent of those 
arrested tested positive up from 69 percent the previous year 
during the reagan years the drug enforcement administrations 
budget has increased by about 120 percent and arrests of major 
violators have increased by 200 percent some 650 million in assets 
were seized from drug traffickers in the fiscal year that ended 
sept 30 1988 
the nations appetite for drugs manufactured in clandestine 
laboratories has increased substantially and the dea 
counterattacked by putting hundreds of drug labs out of business 
last year new federal legislation gives the dea tools to clamp down 
on the export of usmanufactured chemicals used in cocaine 
processing 
our efforts have shown that coordinated law enforcement can 
have an impact but theyve also shown that enforcement alone wont 
adequately address the drug issue dea chief jack lawn said in an 
interview last week 
pressing for reductions in the demand for drugs through nancy 
reagans just say no program and the myriad other efforts being 
tried are vital pieces of the countrys antidrug efforts said

as a candidate in 1980 reagan decried what he called a 
halfcentury of judicial activism he promised to appoint judges who 
would not view themselves as social engineers 
as reagan leaves the presidency a more conservative federal 
judiciary is one of his more enduring legacies says vicki 
marani of the conservative washington legal foundation 
in eight years reagan filled about half of all current federal 
judgeships according to the administrative office of the us 
courts he appointed 291 of 575 federal trial judges and 89 of 168 
appeals court judges he also appointed three of the supreme courts 
nine members 
compared to his most recent predecessors reagan appointed a 
smaller percentage of women and minorities to the federal bench 
his appointees generally have been white probusiness with 
little respect for individual rights says nan aron of the liberal 
alliance for justice 
her organization which has tracked reagans judicial selections 
says 21 percent of his appointments to the federal bench are black 
and 34 percent are hispanic women comprise 82 percent of the 
reagan judicial appointees 
among the 264 judges appointed by jimmy carter in his fouryear 
presidency 143 percent were black 62 percent were hispanic and 
155 percent were women 
reagans appellate court appointments have been more closely 
scrutinized by liberals and conservatives alike because the 
administration wields more power in making those selections 
traditionally members of the senate play the largest role in the 
selection of federal trial judges 
theres never been an administration in which the attorney 
general first william french smith and then edwin meese iii took 
such a personal interest in the selection of appellate judges 
aron says there was always the singular objective of creating a 
more conservative federal appellate bench and a stringent 
ideological test was applied 
those who participated in the reagan administrations judicial 
selection process deny applying any such ideological test 
but a recently completed study of each of the 12 federal 
appellate courts throughout the nation by the american lawyer 
newspapers said the president has transformed the circuit courts 
by appointing a new breed of conservative judges mostly young 
rigorously intellectual and critics charge overly ideological 
who have exerted a dynamic influence on the appellate bench 
aron among those who concur in the overly ideological 
allegations also agrees with the rest of the assessment 
marani says i am aware of several studies conducted by 
liberals showing a more conservativeleaning judiciary the fact 
that liberals are unhappy would give us cause for great 
celebration

when reagan took the oath of office eight years ago he promised 
government would no longer ride on our back but experts 
including his former top economic adviser say he made few inroads 
against the spread of government regulation 
reagan is leaving office with pressures mounting for new health 
safety and environmental regulations to address environmental 
worries and the growing numbers of americans with no health 
insurance 
i forecast that were in the early stages of a new wave of 
government intervention in the economy said murray weidenbaum 
chairman of reagans council of economic advisers in 198182 
the federal communications commission has scaled back regulation 
of radio and television broadcasting including an end to the 
fairness doctrine 
the sweeping government deregulation of the airline industry 
predated the reagan administration as did looser regulations of the 
financial markets the breakup of atampt was ordered by a federal 
judge not executive fiat the trucking and rail industries remain 
subject to extensive regulation 
a lot of this stuff was really done before reagan came in 
said clifford winston a senior fellow in economics at the brookings 
institution actually theres probably been a growth of the 
environmental safety regulation during his time 
jeffrey eisenach a heritage foundation fellow said the 
reagan administrations battle against excessive government 
regulation proved even more difficult than expected 
the early reagan deregulators could not have imagined some 
of the obstacles that would be thrown into their path by congress 
and the courts eisenach wrote in heritages mandate for 
leadership iii study 
weidenbaum said the new reagan administration rolled back some 
midnight rules issued by carter imposed benefitcost reviews of 
new regulations and strengthened the regulatory reform machinery at 
the office of management and budget 
bush as vice president headed a task force on regulatory reform 
that prided itself on cutting red tape 
but the effort lost steam said weidenbaum a washington 
university professor and scholar at the center for strategic and 
international studies as top reagan officials opted to concentrate 
on cutting the budget and taxes not deregulation 
the two most notorious people in the administration identified 
with regulation were jim watt former interior secretary and anne 
gorsuch burford former epa director said weidenbaum they 
stirred up such a firestorm it put us all on the defensive the 
second term was spent mending fences that were broken in the first 
term 
but while the deregulatory drive may have lost some momentum 
winston said were not going to set up the cab civil aeronautics 
board again to decide what air fares are going to be

though in the later years there were scattered actions praised by 
environmentalists notably the treaty reducing use of chemicals that 
destroy the earths protective ozone layer the reagan 
administrations record on the environment is largely a story of 
stalemate 
the treaty offers a precedent for tackling an issue that only now 
is reaching the spotlight the global warming of the greenhouse 
effect produced by burning fossil fuels 
overall the environmental report card is mixed the 
administration after initially favoring inaction sharply reduced 
emissions of lead to the atmosphere from gasoline urban smog 
though remains a mess for more than 107 cities more than a year 
past the deadline for meeting clean air standards and congress has 
not decided what to do next 
water pollution cleanup remains uneven with fouled beaches in 
the headlines and more and more discoveries of groundwater 
contamination 
cleanup of toxic waste dumps under the superfund program a 
15billionayear effort now is painfully slow expensive and 
controversial only a handful have been completed 
as a society we have misused the opportunities that presented 
themselves in the last eight years said peter aa berle 
president of the national audubon society 
but paul pritchard president of the national parks and 
conservation association said of the environmental community we 
have hung the noose around ourselves 
we as leaders of the environmental community should not endorse 
presidential candidates he said referring to the 1980 rose 
garden appearance of many of those leaders endorsing jimmy carter as 
individuals 
reagan came to office after scorning environmentalist positions 
noting that trees pollute which is a fact environmentalists 
returned the scorn with jokes about killer trees 
one of the new administrations first acts was to cut the white 
house council on environmental quality from 50 positions to eight 
reagans choice to head the enviromental protection agency anne 
burford didnt even arrive at the agency until four months after 
the inauguration and gave the impression she believed the 
bureaucracy was the enemy 
she didnt know washington she accepted savage cuts from the 
office of management and budget at first not fighting for funds 
she rarely consulted members of congress or had environmentalists in 
her office 
loyal to the president she withheld documents from congress on 
his instructions over her own misgivings she fired the assistant 
administrator in charge of the superfund rita lavelle for lying 
when the smoke cleared mrs burford had been eased out and ms 
lavelle was in prison convicted of lying to congress too 
the first interior secretary james watt was convinced that 
overblown environmental worries were locking away valuable 
resources watt almost the embodiment of the sagebrush 
rebellion resentment of federal control of western lands was 
determined to unlock them and to taunt environmentalists too 
after watt the sagebrush rebellion petered out according to 
some analysts under recognition by washingtons western critics 
that they benefitted from federally subsidized electricity grazing 
rights irrigation water and timber sales

four years after recordbreaking cold forced an 
indoor inaugural george bush must cope with the vagaries of 
washington weather in planning for his presidential oathtaking 
bushs inaugural committee is making contingency plans including 
a swearingin ceremony in the capitol rotunda in the event of 
weather disruptions 
while meteorologists say it is too soon to make a prediction for 
friday inauguration day the 30day weather forecast for washington 
in january called for a 55 percent chance of above normal 
temperatures and dryer than normal conditions for the month 
does that mean bushs inauguration wont be plagued by a driving 
rain like that which nearly washed away franklin d roosevelts 
second swearingin in 1937 
or a snowstorm such as nearly buried william howard taft in 1909 
or perhaps a raw cloudy day like that in 1841 when william henry 
harrison took office without hat or overcoat harrison caught a cold 
that turned into pneumonia killing him after but a month in office 
president reagans 1985 inaugural ceremonies were moved inside 
when 10degree temperatures and winds of 17 mph put the wind chill 
factor at 16 below zero 
such history notwithstanding a study of climate shows the 
washington weather on jan 20 is often but not always mild 
weather historian patrick hughes details the effects of the 
elements on inaugurations in the december issue of weatherwise 
magazine in his study he notes that average weather for the date is 
44 degrees fahrenheit and normally only enough rain or snow falls 
to wet the pavement 
the date for the inauguration was changed in the 1930s when it 
was moved up from march 4 jan 20 was picked after a study of 
weather records showed it to be usually mild for that time of year 
roosevelts wet and chilled ceremony in 1937 was the first to be 
held in january and criticism promptly followed 
sen george w norris of nebraska who spearheaded the change 
warned critics to wait until march 4 to see what the weather would 
be like then before criticizing him for the change 
it was of course a beautiful day sunny with a high 
temperature of 67 degrees unusually warm for that date hughes 
observes 
perhaps the most practical approach to inaugural weather came 
from harry s truman upon receiving a formal invitation to his own 
swearingin ceremony truman wrote across it weather permitting 
i hope to be present it was a chilly 38 degrees and windy that 
day but the sun was out and truman was there 
official weather records were not kept at the time but 
historians recorded it as a cool and clear day in new york city when 
george washington became the first president on april 30 1789 
four years later the event was moved to philadelphia and to march 
4 as determined by congress and the weather was listed as 
pleasant for the start of washingtons second term it was 
fair in the city of brotherly love when john adams took office 
in 1797 
after that the ceremonies moved to the new capital city 
washington where it was mild and beautiful for thomas jefferson 
in 1801 and fair for the start of his second term in 1895

historians as probably fair

defense attorneys for gaf corp and a senior 
company officer fighting stock manipulation charges have seized on 
the declaration of a mistrial as grounds to have the entire 
indictment dismissed 
if they succeed it would mark a major defeat for prosecutors 
because the gaf trial marks the first important case arising from 
the wall street corruption scandal to reach the trial phase 
it has been seen as a key test of the governments ability to 
persuade a jury of criminal charges resulting from the scandal 
which is now more than two years old 
us district judge mary johnson lowes mistrial ruling tuesday 
stunned a packed courtroom and came after the defense challenged the 
government prosecutors handling of an important piece of evidence 
and said it had unfairly hurt their case 
lowe dismissed the jurors apologizing one month into a trial 
that has attracted widespread attention the judge said she intended 
to start picking a jury for a new trial later in the week 
defense attorneys then requested dismissal of the entire 
indictment arguing the government is constitutionally barred from 
bringing two actions against a defendant for the same charges 
after lowe rejected their request the defense attorneys filed an 
intention to appeal to the 2nd circuit court of appeals but it was 
unclear late tuesday whether the higher court would grant their 
request for a hearing 
were appealing on grounds that the law says you dont have to 
wear the same wet bathing suit twice arthur liman the lead 
lawyer for gaf and one of the most prominent defense attorneys in 
the country told reporters 
liman and stephen kaufman attorney for gaf vice chairman james 
t sherwin said they had no other option than to request a mistrial 
because of a controversy about an invoice the government had 
introduced to support its charges of stock manipulation 
after defense attorneys challenged the invoices authenticity 
during testimony last week prosecutor carl loewenson acknowledged 
he had failed to provide them with a report indicating the evidence 
may have been tampered with 
loewenson called the error an act of carelessness that would not 
affect the trial but the judge said under strict rules of 
evidencegathering the prosecutor was obligated to share such 
information with the defense attorneys who claimed they would have 
altered their strategy had they known about it 
the government minimized the significance of the mistrial which 
coincided with the announcement that us attorney rudolph w 
giuliani the leader of a major crackdown on wall street corruption 
will resign at the end of the month after more than five years of 
service 
this is not a lastminute slap in the face giuliani told a 
news conference we cant criticize her lowes decision 
although we would have preferred to go forward with the case 
legal experts said they doubted the gaf defense team would 
succeed in getting the indictment thrown out by an appeals court 
which ordinarily grants wide discretionary powers to lowercourt 
judges who declare mistrials 
it sounds like the defense is doing what it has to do leaving 
no stone unturned to get the maximum benefit out of it said 
gerard lynch a professor at columbia law school in new york 
gaf and sherwin were indicted in july on charges they attempted 
to manipulate up the value of union carbide corp stock in late 1986 
after a failed takeover attempt of the larger company the alleged 
motive was to maximize the gain gaf would realize from the sale of 
its stake in carbide 
evidence for the indictment has been supplied largely by 
securities trader boyd l jefferies who claimed his los angeles 
brokerage was utilized by gaf to conduct manipulative trades in 
carbide stock to inflate the price 
jefferies an admitted felon who has not been sentenced is a 
leading government witness in at least three major securitiesfraud 
prosecutions 
he was implicated by ivan f boesky the notorious insider trader 
who turned states evidence in late 1986 boesky is now serving a 
threeyear federal prison term

west german chancellor helmut kohl on 
wednesday called for a reasonable solution to a trade dispute 
between the european economic community and the united states over a 
ban on the imports of american hormonetreated beef 
both sides should resolve their problems in a reasonable way in 
the spirit of transatlantic partnership and aware of their 
responsibility for the world economy kohl told reporters at a 
news conference in bonn 
the eec ban on us beef produced from cattle that had been fed 
growth hormones took effect on jan 1 
the united states retaliated with punitive tariffs on several 
european products 
such trade conflicts can only hurt both sides economically and 
politically kohl said 
he said such disputes give a completely false signal for a 
meeting of the general agreement on tariffs and trade that will be 
held in april and for the world economic summit scheduled this 
summer 
kohl did not suggest any possible solutions to the beef dispute 
he pledged strong support for the 12 european nations efforts to 
forge a single european market by the end of 1992 
weve reached the point of no return the target date will be 
met kohl said adding that west germany will make every effort to 
assist spain and france which hold the rotating eec presidency this 
year in pushing through important decisions that have to be made 
kohl said agreement has to be reached before the end of 1990 on 
tax harmonization on the socalled social dimensions of the 
internal market on a joint monetary policy and on the ways and 
means of coping with the security effect of open borders 
he said those decisions have to be made well before 1992 to allow 
individual nations to adapt domestic legislation to eec changes 
kohl said that europe will not turn into a protectionist 
fortress once internal borders are eliminated he stressed that 
west germany as the worlds largest exporter is well aware of the 
need for free trade and will strongly promote an eecwide freetrade 
approach

two state agencies have cleared the way for 
banks to sell insurance for the first time in california as called 
for by the voterapproved insurance reform initiative proposition 
103 officials said 
but attorneys for the states largest association of insurance 
agents vowed tuesday to challenge the decision in court 
state insurance commissioner roxani gillespie and state bank 
superintendent howard gould both issued recent rulings saying 
proposition 103 effectively repeals all state laws keeping banks out 
of the insurance business 
in a letter to the independent insurance agents and brokers of 
california mrs gillespie said she and gould rejected the agents 
argument that the banks are still barred from selling insurance 
because proposition 103 didnt explicitly repeal two provisions in 
the financial code regulating banks 
the agents argued that proposition 103s wording aimed at 
repealing provisions in the insurance code forbidding such sales 
couldnt be applied to the banking codes 
but gould released a bulletin saying the banking department 
considers that the financial code restrictions are repealed by 
implication with the passage of proposition 103 and has prepared a 
legal opinion to that effect 
the commissioner also denied a request for a public hearing on 
the dispute 
we are disappointed with mrs gillespies refusal to hold a 
hearing and her decision to defer to the banking departments 
opinion said the agents legal counsel stephen young we do 
not agree with their reasoning 
about half of the banks in california those possessing state 
charters are affected by proposition 103 allowing these banks to 
sell insurance has long been a goal of insurance reformers trying to 
boost competition and cut prices in the insurance business 
insurance companies are challenging the constitutionality of 
proposition 103 in the state supreme court the high court has 
allowed most of the ballot initiative to become law pending its 
review the propositions provision calling for a 20 percent 
rollback in insurance rates has not been put into effect however

surgeon general c everett koop said today the 
united states has undergone a revolution in smoking behavior in 
the last 25 years but young people are continuing to take up the 
habit and women are quitting at a slower rate than men 
koop speaking at a news conference where he issued the surgeon 
generals latest annual report on smoking said smoking rates are 
also higher among blacks bluecollar workers and less educated 
people 
because more than 50 million americans continue to smoke and 
because of the residual increased risk of death and disease in 
exsmokers smoking remains the most important preventable cause of 
death in our society he said 
smoking is responsible for more than one of every six deaths in 
the united states he said 
its no exaggeration to say that a revolution in smoking 
behavior has occurred koop said the gains we have made in 
curtailing the use of cigarettes in the united states represent one 
of the greatest public health achievements of all time 
however he said that if current smoking trends among women 
continue women will be smoking at higher rates than men beginning 
in the mid1990s 
in addition he said smoking among high school seniors has 
leveled off in recent years after previous years of decline 
i think some of the worrisome news is that its continuing to 
decline but at a much slower rate among women and the big thing is 
that young kids are continuing to start almost as much as they 
were 10 20 years ago dr patrick remington of the wisconsin 
division of health one of the authors of the report said on cbs 
this morning 
one factor in womens smoking he said is that risktaking 
behavior over the last 20 years especially among young women has 
become more common and cigarettesmoking is one risktaking 
behavior 
antismoking campaigns have been most successful in getting white 
men to put out their cigarettes and the report calls for more 
efforts aimed at women children minorities and high school 
dropouts who are not quitting as quickly 
the annual report issued tuesday by surgeon general c everett 
koop on the 25th anniversary of the governments first such report 
says the proportion of american smokers has declined from 40 percent 
of the population in 1965 to 29 percent in 1987 
these changes represent nothing less than a revolution in 
behavior koop said in the report thanks to the remarkable 
progress of the past 25 years we can dare to envision a smokefree 
society 
however he said smokers are disproportionately found in 
groups that are harder to reach and this disparity may increase 
over time greater effort and resources will need to be devoted to 
achieve equivalent reductions in smoking among those whose behavior 
has survived strong countervailing pressures 
the 700page report documents changes in the 25 years since the 
surgeon generals initial declaration that cigarette smoking leads 
to cancer and other serious diseases 
the most significant shift has come among men half of whom 
smoked in 1965 according to the report by 1987 less than a third 
were lighting up 
women smokers declined from 32 percent to 27 percent over the 
period the report said 
the figures also show a slow decline among blacks 43 percent to 
34 percent and virtually no change among those who never graduated 
from high school 37 percent to 36 percent 
among high school seniors daily cigarette smoking dropped from 
29 percent in 1976 to 21 percent in 1980 and then leveled off in the 
1821 percent range for the seven years after that 
since 1977 prevalence of smoking among high school senior girls 
has been greater than that among boys of that age 
among the other findings of the report 
nearly 45 percent of american adults who ever smoked have quit 
though the quit ratio does not take into account the length of a 
quitters abstinence 
smoking is responsible for more than one of every six deaths in 
the united states and remains the single most important 
preventable cause of death in our society 
between 1964 and 1987 some 789000 smokingrelated deaths were 
avoided or postponed as a result of decisions to quit smoking or not 
to start which the report attributes to the antismoking campaign 
fourfifths of smokers born since 1935 started smoking before 
age 21 and the proportion of people who begin smoking during 
adolescence has been increasing particularly among women a quarter 
of high school seniors who have ever smoked had their first 
cigarette by sixth grade and half by eight grade 
the number of legal restrictions on childrens access to tobacco 
products has decreased over the past 24 years and vendor 
compliance with minimumageofpurchase laws is the exception rather 
than the rule 
the first surgeon generals report concluded narrowly that 
smoking increases deaths among men and causes lung and laryngeal 
cancer in men and chronic bronchitis in men and women 
surgeon general reports since then have concluded that smoking 
increases deaths among men and women and causes lung and laryngeal 
cancer in both the reports over the years also have tied smoking to 
heart disease atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease and low birthweight babies as well as 
cancers of the mouth esophagus bladder kidney and stomach cervix 
and pancreas

relishes making the most of his caring image as the man who 
brought the cat in from the cold 
a new cat food expected on supermarket shelves in february or 
march the first for edward lowe industries inc also will bear 
his picture 
were going to promote the character of ed lowe a little more 
because no one else can do that lowe said during an interview at 
the 3000acre farm in southwestern lower michigan where he lives 
and conducts business as chairman and chief executive officer of the 
company he founded 
two cats roam the offices which resemble a tasteful country inn 
more than the headquarters of a company with annual revenues of 150 
million sales offices are located about 20 miles away in south 
bend ind 
lowe dressed in corduroys a red sweater and matching bandana 
drinks coffee from a cat coffee mug and is surrounded by a host of 
cat sculptures paintings even a stuffed toy cat that moves its 
head 
more than a hundred cats are housed in lowes cat care center 
where cat box filler and food preference are studied the cats are 
kept either individually in small glassenclosed rooms or in groups 
of 10 or 20 in larger rooms where behavior is monitored 
despite appearances lowe says hes never been crazy about cats 
especially when he gave out that first bag of clay 
i didnt dislike them lowe said i wasnt and im still 
not a fanatic about any pet 
chickens were on lowes mind in 1946 when he began trying to 
market granulated clay to poultry farmers as a nesting material 
when chicken litter failed to catch on lowe returned to his 
fathers sawdust business in vandalia mich which sold the 
absorbent clay to soak up oil and grease 
on a cold day in january 1947 a friend of lowes kay draper 
approached him for some sand for her cat box because all the sand 
at the sawdust business had frozen lowe instead gave her a bag of 
the clay 
word spread and before long lowe was peddling his kitty litter 
from the trunk of his 43 chevy to pet shops and at cat shows across 
the country 
if i hadnt seen kay that day id still be shoveling 
sawdust lowe says with a laugh 
for more than 10 years lowe was alone in the cat litter business 
today lowe industries is the leader in what has grown to be a 
600 million industry between kitty litter which retails for 189 
for an eightpound bag and his less expensive cat box filler tidy 
cat lowe says he controls about 40 percent of the market 
he employs 500 people at five plants in missouri illinois 
california and tennessee where clay deposits are plentiful 
despite his success lowe still fights the use of kitty litter as 
a generic term 
i have the same problem as kleenex you just gotta keep 
fighting it lowe says however he calls the dilemma a joyful 
problem i would rather have it that way than not have it at all 
lowe hopes to advance that cause by putting his face on all of 
his products he also hopes that by familiarizing consumers with his 
picture he will capture their trust 
he wants to become to cat box filler what colonel sanders is to 
fried chicken and orville redenbacher is to popcorn 
though corporate strategy is to promote a gentle grandfatherly 
image lowe isnt shy about taking credit for establishing an 
industry he figures the hugely competitive cat food business and 
veterinary practices are outgrowths of his product 
i think that ive made the cat popular lowe says you 
wouldnt be able to own a cat if you didnt have kitty litter 
lowe also has started a foundation at his farm to support 
partnership programs for owners of family and independent businesses 
building a foundation allows you to go on forever and my 
mission is to help entrepreneurs lowe said 
this property will be given to the foundation when i go to the 
great cat box in the sky

energy futures opened higher today partly in 
response to a nationwide shutdown of mexicos refinery operations by 
striking union workers 
on the new york mercantile exchange gasoline prices shot up as 
much as 079 cent a gallon before midday pulling crude prices up 
with them the february contract for crude oil was up 18 cents at 
1787 a barrel 
analysts said the stronger prices partially reflected investor 
concern that the disruption in mexican refinery operations could 
mean lower us supplies the striking workers are protesting the 
arrest of their union boss on gunrunning charges 
the us doesnt get that many oil imports from mexico the 
concern is that we might move production into mexico said andrew 
lebow senior broker and analyst for edampf man international 
futures inc 
todays rise in oil prices also resulted from tuesdays american 
petroleum institute report showing that crude oil inventories 
declined sharply last week analysts said 
on tuesday the february contract for west texas intermediate 
the benchmark grade of us crude oil settled 3 cents lower at 
1769 a barrel after having been down as much as 25 cents during 
the session on monday the february contract closed 17 cents higher 
at 1772 a barrel 
among refined products traded on the exchange domestic heating 
oil futures ended mixed with the february contract settling at 
5386 cents a gallon down 029 cent 
unleaded gasoline futures also closed mixed with the february 
contract down 005 cent at 4791 cents a gallon 
analysts said prices were dragged down by profittaking energy 
analysts said investors decided to take advantage of steadily rising 
prices and began a round of heavy selling early in the day 
prices later recovered most of their losses on reports that 
nonopec oil producing countries were preparing to announce 
production cutbacks to help bolster the recent accord among members 
of the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
after the close of trading the american petroleum institute 
reported that for the week ended jan 6 crude oil stocks fell by 
55 million barrels to 32886 million barrels gasoline supplies 
increased by 531000 barrels to 2291 million and heating oil stocks 
were up 726000 to 1275 million barrels 
nauman barakat vice president of energy investments at 
prudentialbache securities inc said the api report would probably 
send crude futures higher 
many people were expecting a buildup of as high as 7 million 
barrels of crude so the api report will be construed to be very 
positive for the market he said

the advancedtechnology boeing 747400 featuring 
a twoperson crew and distinctive winglets has been certified for 
use with pratt amp whitney engines boeing commercial airplanes 
announced wednesday 
the federal aviation administration issued its approval tuesday 
boeing said in a statement clearing the way for deliveries to 
customer airlines 
the aircraft which in various configurations will seat 
approximately 420 passengers is due to be certified early this 
spring for use with general electric and rollsroyce engines 
the flight test program for approval of the newest boeing 
jetliner has taken 8 months and has focused on differences between 
the 747400 and earlier models of the jumbo jet boeings elizabeth 
reese said 
differences include a digital flight deck and avionic system plus 
aerodynamic features such as increased wingspan and the winglets at 
the wing tips 
the flight deck is simplified and equipped for two crew members 
instead of the threecrew flight deck on other 747s 
boeing said the flight test program so far has required 2600 
hours of intensive testing half of that in the air flight rates of 
70 to 80 hours per month per airplane have been achieved said the 
company one of the highest rates attained on such a program for 
boeing 
four planes have been used during the program to certify the 
three engines boeing said it is the first time it has attempted to 
certify three different engine types in a single flight test program 
northwest airlines selected pampw4000 engines for its 747400s when 
it ordered 10 of the the aircraft on oct 22 1985 
lufthansa ordered 12 747400s delivered with ge cf680c2 engines 
while cathay pacific has ordered two airplanes with rollsroyce

the free marketplace is a magnificent 
disciplined creation that distributes goods to where they should be 
at the right or competitive price the right time and generally 
in the right amount 
but it also is contrary at the same time it is forever filled 
with idle dreams and grand illusions some of which become so 
allenveloping that for a time they capture the minds of otherwise 
sensible people 
the eccentricity that leads to excess seems to occur with special 
intensity in real estate and securities but it can be found in 
almost every area of the market including automobiles sports 
clothing food housing electronics 
the latest and biggest in the financial area by far is the 
notion that junk bonds can be sold in enormous quantities at high 
rates of interest and with little regard to a corporations 
financial structure without penalty 
the penalty of course is merely delayed since no corporation 
can afford to pay rates greater than the market and greater than the 
competition and still manage to operate as if it hadnt done so the 
penalty is delayed not erased 
nobody can say when reality will appear but economists who 
examine the situation believe it might be in the midst of an 
economic downturn and relatively high interest rates that is 
business will be off and expenses up 
it isnt the only major illusion at work today one that is 
growing popular in certain circles is that the economic cycle of ups 
and downs has been broken and that major booms and recessions are a 
thing of the past 
true there is a growing body of evidence that suggests the cycle 
has been muted at least and that instead of nationwide booms and 
busts the economy now experiences what is sometimes termed rolling 
readjustments 
such economic events are limited rather than general usually 
involving one or a few geographical areas or industries at a time 
in mid1986 for example the nations heartland was slumping while 
the coastal economies were strong 
the rolling adjustment thesis gains support from the current 
sixyearlong expansion which generally is expected to last another 
year or so but to say the economic cycle has been broken is to take 
a grand canyonlike leap 
that is while the immediate evidence might seem to substantiate 
the belief economic events are not nearly that forecastable one 
major event such as a sudden rise in the price of oil could 
distill that notion to vapor 
do you recall when oil experts forecast 100 a barrel when 
the rage in the late 1960s was for growth stocks at priceearnings 
ratios of 60 when in 1987 nowchagrined analysts foresaw 3500 
points on the dow jones average 
can you forget the texassize optimism of savings and loans that 
there were easy billions in real estate that in the 1960s companies 
risked their futures on bowling as the participant game of the 
future 
the nocheck society the home electronic center do you recall 
how so many farmers lost their land by acquiring too much land 
believing that the price per acre would continue to rise like a line 
to the horizon 
never underestimate the ability of the marketplace a relatively 
sane place when you analyze it to produce aberrations that 
continually find a stable of naive believers who strangely had 
managed to succeed by using their heads

only one american worker in 100 was tested for 
drug use last year the government said wednesday in announcing a 
study that sharply reduced previous estimates of how many employers 
conduct such tests 
for job applicants the chance of being tested was four times 
higher than for workers already on the job the labor department 
survey of 7500 employers showed 
the survey conducted last summer found that only 3 percent of 
all employers had drugtesting programs together those companies 
employed 20 percent of american workers 
just 7 percent of employers offered some type of drug counseling 
or other employeeassistance program in all 31 percent of workers 
were covered by these efforts 
the survey found no rush to begin testing programs at 
establishments that dont have them now only 4 percent of employers 
said they were considering launching a testing program in the next 
year just 3 percent said they might create employeeassistance 
programs 
those numbers were sharply lower than past estimates of the 
prevalence of drugtesting programs 
a 1986 survey of 492 organizations by the employment management 
association said 209 percent reported having testing programs a 
michigan state university study that year said 43 percent of 
employers who were not testing for drugs were considering doing so 
labor department researchers asked about the sharply lower 
numbers in the their study said the governments larger sample size 
should make the new estimates the most accurate yet 
the study did not include government workers many of whom are 
subject to drug testing under state and federal policies that are 
the focus of dozens of legal challenges nationwide the labor 
department said no figures were available on the number of public 
workers subject to drug testing 
as to who is tested in the private sector the 7500 employers 
told the labor department researchers that 953000 workers had been 
tested in the previous 12 months compared to 39 million job 
applicants 
in all the report said that about 85 percent of establishments 
with testing programs targeted job applicants while 64 percent 
focused on current employees employers with testing programs 
appear to place a high priority on keeping potential drug problems 
out of the workplace 
studies have estimated that employers lose more than 8 billion a 
year in wasted productivity because of drug use 
of the estimated 953000 workers tested for drug use the survey 
said that 9 percent had tested positive of the applicants tested 
12 percent were positive 
researchers cautioned against taking those figures as 
representative of the rate of drug use because such a small 
proportion of employees test for drugs and because so much testing 
is performed on suspected drug users 
indeed about twothirds of employers conducting tests did them 
only on workers suspected of drug use while onefourth had programs 
that subjected all employees to possible testing 
workforce size was by far the biggest factor in determining 
whether an employer had a drugtesting program 
of the nations largest establishments those with 1000 
employees or more 43 percent tested for drugs while 76 percent 
offered counseling or some other form of assistance but only about 
2 percent of the smallest establishments those with fewer than 50 
workers had testing programs 9 percent had employeeassistance 
programs 
a breakdown by industry found the highest rate of positive test 
results about 20 percent among employees in wholesale and retail 
trade 
that industry also had the highest rate of positive test results 
among applicants 17 percent for wholesale trade and 24 percent for 
the retail sector 
the lowest rate of positive test results among employees was in 
transportation 56 percent a statistic influenced by mandatory 
testing in many sectors of the industry nearly 10 percent of 
applicants for transportation jobs tested positive for drugs the 
study found 
the rate of positive test results among applicants was lowest at 
55 percent in communications and public utilities nearly 8 
percent of workers in those industries who were checked tested 
positive for drugs 
mining communications and public utilities and transportation 
employers were most likely to have drugtesting programs partly 
because of regulatory requirements the study said least likely to 
have testing programs were retail trade service and construction 
establishments

wednesday on the chicago board of trade in a late selloff linked to 
increasingly bearish expectations for an agriculture department crop

contain the governments final 1988 crop production totals new 
estimates of the nations grain and soybean stockpiles projections 
for 1989 corn and soybean plantings and an actual tally of the

seedings to be more than 15 percent above the previous year the 
1988 corn and soybean production totals are expected to be higher 
than the last usda estimate

women praised the largest sex discrimination 
settlement ever reached by the us labor department as a moral 
victory wednesday but the bank involved claimed no defeat and 
industry analysts questioned whether the case would have any 
farreaching effects 
the 14 million settlement to be shared by an estimated 5000 
women and minorities arose out of a 1977 case in which the labor 
department accused chicagos harris trust and savings bank of 
promoting white men at a higher rate and paying them more than women 
and minority workers with comparable skills 
under terms of the agreement announced tuesday women and 
minority workers employed by harris from 1973 to 1988 will share 14 
million in back pay 
in addition the bank must revise its affirmative action policies 
and set up training programs for women and minorities seeking 
promotions 
this was for myself and many others a moral victory a victory 
of principle said marti page a former harris employee she said 
six years of hard work left her doing little more clerical tasks 
while earning 25 percent less than newlyhired male colleagues with 
similar qualifications 
harris officials called the settlement a window out of a 
sticky legal situation that cost 11 years worth of legal fees and 
bad publicity 
we do not acknowledge any wrongdoing company spokeswoman 
mary ullrich said 
in pursuing the case before an administrative law judge the 
federal government charged systemic discrimination throughout the 
company the labor departments solicitor george r salem said the 
settlement would benefit not only harris workers but all women 
and minority group workers in the american labor force 
emily richards president of the national association of bank 
women representing 27000 women in financial services said women 
now make up 70 percent of the work force in banks and savings and 
loans by the year 2000 66 percent of new entrants will be women 
i hope the harris settlement will help other companies realize 
that womens needs must be met she said 
but industry analysts said wednesday that affirmative action and 
sensitivity to womens issues are now common in most companies and 
the settlement may have little impact outside harris 
financial institutions are a lot more sensitive to this issue 
and take more precautions most companies have already addressed the 
issue a new york analyst told the associated press speaking on 
condition he not be named 
the board rooms are still dominated by men but women are 
finding themselves moving further along he said 
that wasnt the case at harris in the 1970s contended women 
employed a chicagobased group that sued harris on behalf of women 
and minorities who found themselves trapped in deadend jobs 
you show me one male college graduate hired in 1970 who was 
given a job with a typewriter said ms page after completing a 
college graduate management training program with excellent 
reviews she said she was assigned to type insurance forms 
harris denied any systemwide policy of discrimination 
show us the individuals and we will make this wrong 
right said ms ullrich we would have said fine no questions 
asked but to say every woman every minority no no 
not every employee of the bank who is entitled to the settlement 
will collect some women dont feel they were discriminated against 
and are refusing their share 
i wont accept an award said one female harris executive who 
asked not to be named 
but others are more than happy about it 
janet schumacher said she waited 12 years to be promoted to a job 
her male colleagues got in an average of three years 
ms schumacher now an investment banker at first national bank 
of chicago said she stayed at harris until 1987 despite her lack 
of advancement because she liked the job 
when she tried to approach management and personnel officials to 
request promotions and transfers she said they gave me such a 
runaround 
harris which has assets of 117 billion reported employing 
3967 workers as of dec 28 1988 of them the company said 598 
percent were women and 337 were minorities 
harris said it would put the settlement money in an escrow 
account in another bank the government is responsible for finding 
the workers and determining how much back pay to award them

americans are not as worried about japanese 
investment in the united states as is commonly supposed a 
usjapan friendship organization said wednesday in releasing a 
poll 
about 44 percent of americans in three states where japanese 
direct investment is most heavily concentrated california 
michigan and tennessee agreed with the proposition that japanese 
direct investment is good for the us economy 
seventeen percent disagreed while 39 percent said they were 
neutral 
the poll was commissioned by the new yorkbased japan society 
with funding from japans national institute for research 
advancement in an attempt to ensure impartiality it was conducted 
by an outside organization the university of miami 
i found it somewhat surprising that americans attitudes were 
relatively favorable david maceachron the japan societys 
president said at a news conference announcing the results 
in addition to 1200 members of the public pollsters separately 
interviewed 416 opinion leaders such as business leaders and 
government officials and 158 blue and whitecollar employees of 
japanese companies in the three states 
among the other findings 
in a negative finding 45 percent of the public felt japanese 
direct investment causes the united states to lose its economic

fourteen percent of the public in the three states agreed but 
36 percent disagreed that japaneseaffiliated companies had too 
much political and economic influence in their states 
seventy percent felt foreign direct investors including the 
japanese should be required to make public the nature and extent of 
their us investments eight percent disagreed 
while states have competed to attract japanese companies with 
special incentives 56 percent disagreed with the idea that states 
should offer more such incentives ten percent thought they should 
opinion leaders were more likely to have a favorable opinion of 
direct japanese investment than the general public and employees of 
japanese companies had the most favorable opinion of all 
the poll was based on information gathered in late 1987 and early 
1988 it was published last month but not publicized until 
wednesday 
japan accounted for about 200 million of the 15 billion in 
total foreign investment in the united states as of the end of 1987 
according to government figures about a sixth of japans investment 
is direct investment in factories office buildings real estate

this is the winter of the new england ski 
industrys discontent snowfall is below average and business is off 
despite efforts to blanket the slopes with manmade white stuff 
packed natural powder provides the best skiing conditions and 
most skiers tend to turn up their noses at the loose or frozen 
granular cover provided by snow guns if only for aesthetic reasons 
its a strange feeling to stand on a ski slope thats covered 
in white and look out around at the houses down below and its all 
covered in brown said phil camp director of the new england ski 
areas council the romance the ambiance just isnt there 
christopher h gill manager of great american ski renting cos 
store in north conway nh said the skiing is really good 
thanks to artificial snow making in his area but he said business 
is down about 25 percent from last year 
it really affects us when theres no snow down in boston 
gill said its funny if we get 3 inches of snow up here but 
theres a foot in boston it does us more good than the other way 
around 
camp who was hosting the councils annual convention for about 
500 ski resort operators at vermonts stratton mountain said 
manmade snow has received a bad reputation 
a short period of time ago it was called artificial snow 
what a mistake that was he said 
leslie b otten director of maines sunday river ski resort 
agreed the first misnomer is that theres any difference in 
quality between a manmade surface and a natuarl surface what 
generally changes skiing surface conditions is weather changes 
those surfaces can be improved by grooming and most slopes can 
be almost completely groomed in two days of cold weather camp said 
operators have not seen a mass exodus from the slopes this 
season but camp said that while the manmade snow is easier to 
groom and moves better because it has less air many still find it 
too slick and dont like to ski on it 
im here at stratton mountain and the average skier sure cant 
complain he said theres a lot of skiing out here for people 
who want it 
only 41 inches of snow fell in the boston area during the first 
half of this season compared to the average over the last 30 years 
of about 9 inches up in ski country the snowfall has been even 
more disappointing for skiers 
were well below average weve had a big 38 inches this 
season and thats almost 2 feet below normal said john cannon of 
the national weather service in portland maine 
and in the last 108 years this is the 100th driest snow season 
in maine he said 
better snowmaking technology and high attendance last year 
inspired resort operators to invest millions in upgrading their 
snowmaking equipment camp said 
if ever snowmaking is going to earn its keep its this 
season he said 
okemo and killington ski areas in vermont have invested heavily 
in snowmaking facilities and are operating at nearly full capacity 
camp said 
but small ski areas without adequate snowmaking facilities are 
hurting sonnenberg in barnard vt hasnt even opened yet for the 
season 
i wish we had the equipment for the people but sadly we 
dont said john lancaster whose wife virginia operates the 
hill

a medical supplier that profited from 
an aidsinduced shortage of latex rubber gloves says it expects to 
report a big loss because a glove glut has emerged leaving it with 
mountains of unsold merchandise 
we have millions of gloves and more arriving said john 
murray vice president for finance at moore medical corp 
moore medical corp had profits of more than 4 million a year 
in 1986 and 1987 and pretax earnings of 31 million in the first 
three quarters of 1988 but it has alerted stockholders to brace for 
a loss in the final quarter and for the year 
the company said a onetime charge in the fourth quarter would be 
in in the range of 7 million to 11 million or 43 million to 
68 million on an aftertax basis 
moores situation is typical of that of many medical supply 
companies 
publicity about aids created an unprecedented demand for the 
gloves last year by spring moore medical and other distributors 
were rationing gloves to customers at a few boxes per order 
we doubled and tripled up on orders to suppliers murray 
said but then supplies from new factories in asia began arriving 
by late fall he said all of a sudden a lot of our orders were 
coming in and what had been close to zero supply became a glut

coffee futures prices collapsed wednesday on new yorks coffee 
sugar amp cocoa exchange as speculators spooked by weakening 
technical signals resumed their flight from the market 
on other markets energy futures scored sharp gains grains and 
soybeans declined livestock and meat were mostly lower precious 
metal futures were down slightly and stockindex futures advanced 
most coffee futures declined 6 cents a pound the permitted limit 
for daily trading the limitless contract for delivery in march 
settled 1167 cents lower amid heavy volume at 13881 a pound a 
fourweek low 
the coffee market obviously crashed said arthur stevenson 
an analyst with prudentialbache securities inc in new york we 
had a literal avalanche 
but analysts could point to no new supplyanddemand developments 
that might have precipitated the collapse instead they said the 
barrage of sell orders was triggered by the markets decline through 
successive sell stops which are price levels at which 
speculators had previously decided they would sell 
selling rapidly accelerated as the march contracts price 
approached 143 a pound stevenson said 
once we fell through there it attracted a great deal of 
additional selling he said 
coffee futures have been in a downward trend since jan 3 the 
first trading session of the new year when march coffee reached a 
27month high of 1669 a pound on bullish supply and demand factors 
analysts said those factors which include drought damage to the 
brazilian coffee crop and strong seasonal demand have not changed 
although recent rains in brazil may have halted the damage there 
the only thing you can say is that volatility in the coffee 
market continues to be very high said sandra kaul an analyst in 
new york with shearson lehman hutton inc the extent of the move 
upward is making the market very vulnerable to a downside 
correction 
energy futures prices rose sharply on the new york mercantile 
exchange mostly in reaction to a weekly american petroleum 
institute report showing a 55 million barrel decline in us crude 
oil stocks 
a lot of oil that should have hit the market has not said 
peter cardillo an analyst with josephthal amp co in new york 
other analysts said members of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries apparently were adhering to opecs new 
production curbs which became effective jan 1

with february at 1817 a barrel heating oil was 11 cent lower to 
33 cent higher with february at 5375 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 05 cent lower to 89 cent higher with february at 
4880 cents a gallon 
grain and soybean futures finished moderately lower on the 
chicago board of trade in a late selloff linked to increasingly 
bearish expectations for fridays agriculture department crop report 
the report scheduled for release after fridays close of 
trading will contain the governments final 1988 crop production 
totals new estimates of the nations grain and soybean stockpiles 
projections for 1989 corn and soybean plantings and an actual tally 
of the 198889 winter wheat acreage 
analysts said they expected the report to show winter wheat 
seedings to be more than 15 percent above the previous year the 
1988 corn and soybean production totals are expected to be higher 
than the last usda estimate 
wheat settled 1 cent to 3 cents lower with march at 444 a 
bushel corn was cent to 2 cents lower with march at 286 a 
bushel oats were cent to 3 cents lower with march at 236 a 
bushel soybeans were 3 cents to 7 cents lower with january at

on the chicago mercantile exchange cattle futures finished mixed 
in technically inspired trading while pork futures fell amid bearish 
fundamental factors

us attorney rudolph w giulianis resignation 
comes at a sensitive time in the wall street crime crackdown he has 
orchestrated with at least a halfdozen major cases unresolved and 
growing criticism of his strongarm tactics by defense lawyers 
giulianis temporary successor benito romano sought to minimize 
the impact of his departure particularly on the outstanding fraud 
prosecutions i think were just beginning to see the 
substantial insider trading and other securities cases romano 
said wednesday 
nonetheless giulianis resignation announcement a day earlier 
coincided with an embarrasing goof by subordinates that triggered a 
mistrial in the first case to reach a jury the stock manipulation 
indictment of chemical company gaf corp and one of its top 
officials 
moreover the case against junkbond giant drexel burnham lambert 
inc though ostensibly settled still hasnt been finalized and 
the other shoe has yet to drop for drexels top financier michael 
milken who is expected to be indicted 
the prosecutors have pushed back an indictment deadline several 
times for john mulheren a securities executive accused of plotting 
to assassinate convicted speculator ivan boesky with a loaded 
assault rifle the latest deadline is feb 12 nearly a year after 
police arrested mulheren outside his home 
although giulianis record is impressive including boeskys 
conviction and cooperation critics contend his love affair with 
television cameras political ambitions and a penchant for 
inflexibility have led his office to prosecute some fraud cases 
without enough evidence 
the most remarkable and embarassing example thus far was the 
headlinegrabbing handcuff arrests and indictment of three prominent 
brokers in february 1987 for securities fraud a few months later 
giuliani had to drop the indictment and promised another his office 
still hasnt brought it 
to be sure giuliani will be widely remembered as one of the most 
vigorous prosecutors on wall street during his tenure he brought 
several important whitecollar felons to justice particularly 
boesky and former investment banker dennis b levine 
he extracted cooperation from other implicated brokers won a 
253 million settlement from kidder peabody group inc and more 
recently negotiated a record 650 million criminal pleabargain 
agreement with drexel though final details are still under 
negotiation 
anybody would have to say his performance as a prosecutor was 
effective said arthur liman a leading attorney who represents 
milken and gaf in the securities fraud prosecutions 
but a key part of the giuliani strategy has been his increasingly 
criticized use of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations 
law as a pressure tactic against drexel and others who have resisted 
him 
the racketeering law known as the rico act originally was meant 
to fight violent gangsters pushers and pimps it allows the 
government to seize a suspects assets before trial and provides for 
crippling penalties upon conviction 
many lawyers say privately that drexels fear of the racketeering 
act led it to settle charges dec 21 that hadnt even been formally 
filed the prospect that the government could seize hundreds of 
millions of dollars in assets and taint drexel as a racketeer was 
evidently too much for the firms top directors 
the awesome power of the racketeering statute was demonstrated to 
drexel earlier in the month when a smaller securities firm was 
forced into liquidation because its partners faced a racketeering 
indictment brought by giulianis office 
nobody in the world dreamed this would be used against 
securities firms said john s stoppelman a washington attorney 
when you put it in the hands of an aggresive prosecutor with 
political ambitions were back in the star chamber he said 
were back to the abuses we were trying to correct in the english 
system 
in giulianis view stoppelman said the approach toward 
securities fraud suspects smacks of presumed guilt an easy 
punishment if you cooperate and a devastating demise if you dont 
they say well be nice to you you play tennis in lompoc 
minimum security prison and you testify against this big 
banana he said 
on the other hand when they say were gonna use rico were 
going to put the squeeze on you thats like saying were going 
to use the abomb

eastern airlines seeking to raise cash has sold 
six a300 widebody jet planes to sister carrier continental 
airlines the company announced wednesday 
eastern will receive 103 million cash and a 67 million note at 
175 percent interest for the sale eastern spokeswoman karen 
ceremsak said 
the planes had been leased earlier to continental and therefore 
will have no effect on the size of easterns fleet she said 
ms ceremsak said the sale was unconnected to the breakdown of 
federallymediated talks between eastern and its machinists union 
this is part of the continued efforts to raise cash she said 
when the talks collapsed on monday joseph b leonard an eastern 
senior vice president said the company would have to move faster on 
sales of its assets the airline which is seeking 150 million in 
wage concessions from the 8500member international association of 
machinists estimates it is losing 1 million a day 
eastern is awaiting completion of a 365 million sale of its 
northeast shuttle service to new york developer donald trump and 
reportedly is seeking buyers for such assets as philadelphia gates 
and some canadian routes 
eastern insists that only a federal declaration of an impasse 
which would set a 30day deadline will get the 15monthold 
contract talks moving with the machinists its largest union 
federal mediators have indicated they are not ready to take that 
action although there has been no word from the washingtonbased 
national mediation board about new talks 
under an impasse if no settlement were reached in 30 days 
eastern could impose its own work conditions and the union could 
strike 
eastern reported 2337 million in losses for the first three 
quarters of 1988 and has lost more than 1 billion in the past 
decade

the european monetary system has gone 
for two years without a realignment in currency values despite 
sharp dollar movements and analysts see no quick end to its 
stability 
the system that maintains stable exchange rates between european 
currencies turns 10 years old in march it has been realigned 11 
times but not once since jan 12 1987 showing the system is 
gaining stability against a volatile dollar 
the ems is moving into a new phase said steven bell chief 
economist for morgan grenfell amp co ltd in london the first few 
years were fairly disruptive and chaotic but the realignments have 
been getting smaller 
anne vleminckx of belgiums generale de banque sa echoing the 
views of other analysts said a realignment may occur in the first 
half of 1989 but that it would be easily digested by the markets it 
might be almost a nonevent she said 
the european monetary system groups eight european economic 
community currencies those of west germany the netherlands 
france italy belgium luxembourg denmark and ireland they range 
against one another within bands that have fixed upper and lower 
limits 
if a currency exceeds its limits central banks must intervene or 
governments must take monetary action if that has no effect the 
european monetary system must be realigned 
as a rule the european monetary system faces realignment when 
either the dollar has fallen too sharply or the west german mark 
becomes too strong against the french franc west germany and france 
account for nearly half of total eec output 
the dollar defies easy prediction but the current bullish trend 
on the eve of the bush administration is reassuring european 
monetary system watchers 
a fall in the dollar normally spurs investors to put more money 
in west german marks lifting them against other european monetary 
system currencies and pushing the monetary system to the breaking 
point 
the dollars long slide from early 1985 was blamed for the 1987 
realignment but today analysts feel the threat is more likely to 
come from internal difficulties 
recently tensions usually only start when the dollar is at 
170 marks or below said reinhard kudiss an economist at the 
west german industry federation in cologne 
at the start of 1988 the european monetary system survived a 
drop in the dollar to 158 marks lately though the dollar has 
been if anything too strong not too weak on wednesday central 
banks were aggressively selling dollars and buying marks to prop up 
the west german currency 
the more difficult problem is a growing francogerman schism 
although the marks recent weakness has caused the issue to recede 
in importance economists say it could reemerge if the mark begins 
to strengthen again against the french currency 
frances booming economy has been heavily importing west german 
capital goods while germanys trade surplus with other eec countries 
is ballooning 
also west german inflation is around 15 percent against 
roughly double that for france higher inflation means french francs 
are steadily losing their real value in terms of marks 
west german officials cautious not to upset their exporters with 
a more costly mark have rejected an european monetary system 
realignment 
i think its very doubtful a realignment will be an issue in 
the foreseeable future finance minister gerhard stoltenberg said 
in late december 
bundesbank president karl otto poehl has added to that one 
must take seriously that the two most important governments within 
the ems of france and west germany do not want a realignment 
french finance minister pierre beregovoy said last week i 
flatly rule out a devaluation of the french franc 
for france a revalued mark means costlier imports and more 
inflation with local elections in march paris is unlikely to want 
to give unions reason for discontent 
yet firm denials of a realignment are ritual exercises that may 
ease but rarely kill market tension 
the trade surpluses with the rest of the eec are getting to be 
an embarrassment to the german authorities and cannot go on 
forever according to nigel rendell an economist with the london 
brokerage james capel bankers ltd 
west germanys trade surplus surged 25 percent in november to its 
secondhighest monthly surplus ever the gain came from trade with 
other eec countries while the surplus with the united states has 
been shrinking 
analysts expect a 1989 realignment if any would upgrade the 
value of the mark and the dutch guilder the other ems stalwart by 
3 to 4 percent and devalue the lira by several percentage points 
opinions varied on other currencies 
france can normally live easier with its electorate after an 
upward valuation of the mark and guilder than with a devaluation of 
the franc 
this happened in 1987 when the french and three other currencies 
were left unchanged while the mark and guilder were valued upward by 
3 percent and the belgian and luxembourg francs were valued upward 
by 2 percent 
analysts see the italian lira as a likely candidate for change in 
any realignment even though it has been unusually stable 
within the european monetary system the lira can range within 6 
percent above and below the systems parity rates for the other 
currencies that divergence is 25 percent either way 
of late the lira has traded near and at times within 225 
percent of its parity rate against the mark 
analysts said a realignment of currencies this year if any is 
not likely to occur anytime near september when the composition of 
the european currency unit is up for review the unit is based on 
the currencies of the eight european monetary system currencies plus 
the pound and the greek drachma

marshall zolp pleaded guilty in april 1987 to racketeering for 
the lasar arms case in which he and 13 people were indicted for 
bilking investors with plans to introduce a bogus selfchilling 
beverage container 
three months later five defendants who stood trial were 
convicted zolp the 13th defendant sentenced did not testify 
zolp and his codefendants promoted laser arms incorporated in 
march 1986 through fake news releases ads and shareholder reports 
to inflate the price they even staged a phony news conference in 
new york city actors were photographed to portray fictitious 
executives on company documents 
his plea part of an agreement to cooperate with the government 
was unsealed wednesday by us district judge alfred lechner jr 
zolp could have received 20 years in prison 
assistant us attorney robert p warren told lechner of zolps 
cooperation in a number of stock fraud investigations some 
involving organized crime members indictments are expected 
authorities said 
he said zolp was used as a vehicle by mobsters for committing 
stock frauds and was viewed by a number of people as a person 
they could franchise to make money for them 
zolps defense attorney raymond sussman of new york went 
farther he said that mobsters beat zolp and threatened him to 
continue carrying out the laser arms fraud zolp who was living in 
the los angeles area is in the witness protection program 
sussman said that despite a track record of securities 
violations zolp never meant to perpetrate such an extended fraud as 
laser arms 
commenting after the hearing sussman said mob members kidnapped 
zolp drove him out to long island ny and held a gun to his 
side saying he was to be murdered instead they beat him 
they said this is just a warning go back to work said 
the attorney sussman said his client was manipulated by figures 
associated with new yorkarea mob families 
in court sussman also revealed that zolp had provided 
information to the fbi about members of a terrorist group jailed 
with zolp at the metropolitan correctional center in new york 
prosecutors would not identify the group further but sussman said 
they were two foreigners awaiting deportation who had legal 
proceedings in federal court in newark and that the information was 
about a possible escape attempt 
two sikhs accused of terrorism in india were recently ordered 
extraditable by a us magistrate here zolp has spent the past two 
years at mcc where the sikhs are being held 
the securities and exchange commission has implicated zolp in at 
least seven security fraud cases nationwide since the early 1980s 
according to an affidavit by an sec attorney filed in federal 
court here zolp raised millions of dollars in stock offerings 
using aliases newspaper advertisements and misleading financial 
statements living a high lifestyle off the proceeds 
a federal prosecutor two years ago said in court that zolp 
changes identities as easily as other people change their 
clothes the prosecutor thenassistant us attorney faith 
hochberg said zolp even once dashed across the tops of dinner 
tables to escape the law 
zolp served two years in vietnam carrying out 60 combat missions 
before deserting to europe where he lived for six years before 
returning under an amnesty program and developing a drinking 
problem said sussman 
jail has taught me fear fear of ever having to return zolp 
told lechner i stand here shamed today i stand here disgraced i 
am financially insolvent however i am rehabilitated he said 
but lechner harshly rejected zolps claim of acting out of 
character 
your conduct has been your character the judge said you 
are a con man

wednesday for a hearing to determine whether it should at least 
temporarily halt a new trial in the stockmanipulation case against

the legal theory that a defendant cant be retried twice for the 
same offense

the trial to the 2nd circuit court of appeals which said it would 
hear arguments on the matter thursday

charges they attempted to manipulate upward the value of union 
carbide corp stock in late 1986 after a failed takeover attempt of 
the larger company the alleged motive was to maximize the gain gaf
