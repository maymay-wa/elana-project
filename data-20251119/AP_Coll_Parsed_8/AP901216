the courting couple in richard greenbergs the 
american plan resembled wounded butterflies and the audience was 
left longing for their escape from the wicked widow who aims so 
well with her butterfly net 
the american plan directed by evan yionoulis opened sunday 
at the manhattan theater club and was to run through jan 18 
wendy makkena plays the fey 20ish lili adler who says things 
that indicate shes unbalanced dw moffett in the role of nick 
lockridge is the visitor to a catskills hotel across the lake who 
woos her 
lilis widowed mother played with a sophisticated turn by joan 
copeland with a german accent is determined to keep lili to 
herself though why is never made clear 
she tells nick that lili isnt just charmingly neurotic but has 
been in a mental hospital 
greenberg best known here for his play eastern standard 
drops in undefined mysteries and undercurrents to give the audience 
little chills 
the audience quickly sided with nick and lili hoping they can 
get together even if he seems to be a fortunehunter 
when the widow fails to warn nick off she tells him shell send 
him to college after the marriage she repeats those words in front 
of lili knowing it will send her into a minibreakdown and help 
her to isolate her daughter 
so that the audience doesnt think its attending a rewrite of 
the heiress greenberg has an old love of nicks show up and 
its a man 
the final scene is played in the adler apartment in 1970 10 
years after the catskills scenes 
the plot suffers somewhat lili says things that dont tally 
with what went before also her personality is markedly changed 
brittle and downtoearth sane makkena seemed uncomfortable with 
the new persona and presented it rather weakly 
how the story ends is less interesting than the personalities of 
the three main characters and the hints of frightening unknowns in 
their backgrounds and lives

a telethon for emergency aid to 
the soviet union collected 122 million most of which will go 
toward medicine after organizers concluded that a soviet famine is 
not imminent dutch radio said 
the fourhour nationwide telethon saturday evening was organized 
by former agriculture minister gerrit braks and included live 
broadcasts from moscow and news about the dwindling food supplies 
in kiev and leningrad 
braks food aid to the russians foundation had been planning 
to use the money to distribute food to residents of moscows lenin 
district 
but the committee changed its strategy after dutch media 
reported that there seemed to be enough food to go round in many 
soviet cities 
several western nations have sent food to the soviet union to 
help people there get through the winter soviet officials say they 
appear to have adequate food supplies the problem is storing and 
distributing the goods

seven portuguesespeaking nations with a 
total population of 185 million have agreed to adopt identical 
spellings for their common language 
portugal its former african colonies cape verde angola 
mozambique guineabissau and sao tome e principe and brazil hope 
the controversial accord they signed sunday will create a unified 
market for portugueselanguage books and movies 
the accord simplifies and harmonizes spellings of a wide list of 
vocabulary it also adds three new letters to the alphabet and 
removes some accents and letters that are no longer spoken 
but critics say the accord could muddle the tongue 
when it takes full effect by the beginning of 1994 some 
portuguese words with very different roots and meaning will be 
spelled the same

on a brisk fall weekend thousands of people 
streamed up a stone stairway to a 350yearold tomb honoring the 
man who far more than microchips or management systems created 
modern japan 
the tomb of shogun ieyasu tokugawa and a goldencrusted shrine 
sit in a forest 70 miles northeast of tokyo the shogun was 
promoted in death from man to god and is known as gongensama 
protector of the realm 
for many visitors the journey may be just an opportunity to 
view the autumn foliage but another impulse sends even retired 
people and young couples with toddlers up the 530foot stairway 
wherever you go in japan theres evidence of the tokugawa 
era so a lot of people are curious to see this place said 
tsuchiyasu kiyomitsu a 30yearold businessman who rested as other 
visitors rang a longcorded bell and paid obeisance 
the bigbellied shogun was a warlord of legendary willpower who 
completed the unification of japan in 1600 and virtually cut it off 
from the world 
japans isolation lasted 268 years and the family dynasty he 
founded deified tokugawa after his death to help legitimize itself 
during the long period of isolation japan created its own brand 
of capitalism including the worlds first futures market in 
rice it also refined the group behavior that still distinguishes 
japanese society scholars say 
under the tokugawas japan began evolving the paternalistic 
protectedmarket economy that has confounded policy makers in 
washington inspired japanbashing around the world and helped make 
the small archipelago very rich 
not surprisingly for japan where families routinely trace their 
ancestry back for centuries the tokugawa legacy exists in the 
flesh as well as in folklore 
had the dynasty not been overthrown in 1868 the man who might 
be shogun today is tsunenari tokugawa 50 current head of the 
family he manages north american operations for nippon yusen a 
tokyobased shipping company 
basically everything that you call japanese our weaknesses 
and our strong points many of them in a sense matured in this 
260year period he told an interviewer in his tokyo office 
maybe we matured too strongly he added with a smile 
referring to international criticism of japans economic practices 
tsunenari tokugawa a child of postwar egalitarian japan gave 
an embarrassed laugh about his aristocratic lineage and pointed out 
that he goes to work every day like any other salaryman 
the executive whose wide eyes and broad face resemble portraits 
of ieyasu tokugawa acknowledged that he and other scions of old 
feudal families often discuss the imprint his ancestors made 
whether we like it or not we are still living under the long 
line of tokugawa influence he said that includes many many 
many things the way we think the way we form teamwork our system 
of education 
perhaps the most enduring legacy developed from a clever method 
ieyasu tokugawa and his descendants used to stay in power scholars 
say they kept the feudal domains they controlled off balance by 
forcing each daimyo or lord to spend half the year in tokyo 
this created a nationwide capital network since money had to 
move in and out of tokyo to support the pilgrimages 
fierce competition arose between domain governments and group 
allegiance developed within them the competition led each domain 
to promote industry and agriculture in part to pay for the 
expensive journeys 
the domain governments were strongly paternalistic wrote 
marius jansen a princeton university expert on tokugawa japan 
they instituted monopolies in whatever was profitable for 
export to other domains it is no accident that one of the great 
modern firms that of mitsubishi had its origins in such an 
administrative arrangement 
friends and colleagues tease tsunenari tokugawa about the 
shogun business he must attend to on each anniversary of 
ieyasus death he goes to the nikko shrine and dons the 
traditional court costume 
this year the government called upon him to help celebrate the 
400th anniversary of tokyo the city ieyasu founded and made the 
capital of japan 
every march 1 tokyo fishermen practice one of the more obscure 
traditions binding shogun ieyasu tokugawa to modern japan they 
deliver a load of fresh whitebait to tsunenaris home as 
compensation for the fishing rights his ancestors granted theirs 
these things are not really for the tokugawa family 
tsunenari tokugawa said in a sense its in order for them to 
prove their identity

a college chemistry student with a 
previous bomb conviction was charged with building a 35pound bomb 
strong enough to destroy anything within 150 yards authorities 
said 
university of north florida student christopher jones 25 was 
arrested thursday after a onemonth sting operation police said 
friday 
an undercover officer told jones he needed a bomb to blow up a 
car and kill someone said sheriff jim mcmillan that didnt 
seem to bother him a whole lot 
this is what we call a megabomb if this bomb had been 
detonated it could have caused substantial damage or death to 
anyone or any property within a 150yard radius said willi 
ellison an agent with the us bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms 
the bomb 18 inches tall was built from a liquid propane tank 
which had been cut in half filled with chemical explosives and 
equipped with a fiveminute fuse ellison said 
jones was arrested thursday after the undercover officer paid 
300 for the device which was dismantled by bomb squad officers 
he faces 10 years in prison and a 250 fine if convicted of 
possessing an unregistered explosive 
jones was convicted of exploding two pipe bombs at a convenience 
store in 1985 and was placed on five years probation no one was 
injured

a cattle rancher and his son were 
convicted of firstdegree murder saturday for killing chico mendes 
the rain forest defender whose death focused global attention on 
the destruction of the amazon 
the defendants were each sentenced to 19 years in prison at the 
end of the fourday trial the prosecutors accusing the ranchers 
of having stained the forest with his blood had urged the 
maximum 30year sentence 
the sevenmember jury decided darly alves da silva planned the 
dec 22 1988 slaying and that his son darci alves pereira fired 
the shotgun that killed mendes 
scores of mendes supporters and relatives who jammed the tiny 
sweltering wooden courthouse burst into applause when judge adair 
longhini read the verdict after conferring with the jury for more 
than three hours 
ilzamar mendes the slain rubber tappers widow burst into 
tears 
osmarino amancio rodrigues seen as mendes successor in the 
rubber tappers union that campaigns against destruction of the 
forest joined hands with other tappers and flashed a v sign 
defense attorney ruben torres said his clients would appeal 
you cant judge a man guilty on false testimony said dari 
da silva alves da silvas brother 
the trial in this amazon river town 2650 miles northwest of rio 
de janeiro opened wednesday with the surprise murder confession by 
23yearold alves pereira who claimed he had acted alone his 
father fought the charges 
the trial caused a sensation in this nation of 150 million 
where mendes 44 is seen as an ecological martyr who died 
defending the vast amazon jungle from slashandburn destruction by 
ranchers and farmers 
the amazon is the worlds largest rain forest and the only 
habitat for many plant and animal species rubber tappers and 
others depend on the forest for their livelihood but once the 
jungle is cleared it becomes barren of most vegetation within a few 
years 
a texassized chunk of the forest already has been cut down 
prosecutor marcio thomaz bastos a former brazilian bar 
association president said it was the first time in brazil that 
the planner of a slaying had been convicted of murder 
darci and darly surely practiced many other crimes said the 
jubilant bastos this trial should serve as a lever so we can 
open up other cases 
the 54yearold alves da silva slumped in his chair and pressed 
a white handkerchief to his face during closing arguments as bastos 
shouted you killed him you 
bastos had said a verdict of guilty would end an atmosphere of 
terror in the far western amazon state of acre where rich 
landowners often use hired gunmen to eliminate their opponents 
in his threehour closing statement defense attorney ruben 
lopes torres said alves pereira was so perturbed by the mounting 
legal pressure mendes was applying against his father that he was 
pushed into committing the murder 
mendes in 1988 led local rubber tappers and their families to 
stand in front of bulldozers ready to clear virgin forest owned by 
alves da silva 
earlier saturday about 150 people attended a dawn vigil at the 
tomb of mendes who would have been 46 on saturday 
the group of relatives rubber tappers and foreign visitors then 
walked to mendes humble wooden house near the town square for a 
memorial ceremony in memory of his birthday 
it was two years ago that chico told me he would be spending 
his last birthday with me said a weeping ilzamar mendes he 
still lives within the people that are carrying on his work 
on a small wooden table in front of the house now coverted into 
a museum and headquarters of the chico mendes foundation lay the 
united nations global 500 award mendes earned in 1987 for his 
defense of the environment 
an elderly rubber tapper stepped forward and silently placed a 
small metal rubber tapping knife on the table 
rodrigues who is under police protection because of death 
threats unfolded a map of the chico mendes extractivist reserve 
created by the government last year the reserve allows rubber 
tappers to commercially harvest latex nuts and other forest 
products a dream of mendes 
a 2by2 foot block of fresh concrete was laid on the muddy 
ground beside the back door of the house where mendes was hit by 
the shotgun blast 
with a wooden stick a rubber tapper traced the words here 
they killed chico mendes the fight continues

portauprince haiti ap haitians jammed polling places at 
daybreak sunday to cast heir ballots in the first democratic 
presidential election since the election day massacre of 1987 
many polling places opened late but no incidents were reported 
former president jimmy carter and his wife rosalynn were among 
foreign observers at the argentine bellegarde secondary school 
where 14 people died on nov 29 1987 thugs shot and hacked to 
death 34 people during the voting that day and forced elections to 
be canceled 
we wanted to come here as a symobolic thing to show the people 
of haiti that its safe to vote today carter said 
the polls opened at 6 am and were to close at 6 pm 
haitians voted for president and elected 110 members of a 
bicameral national assembly 134 mayors 268 municipal council 
members and 1695 county officials 
runoff elections will be held in late january in races in which 
no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote 
the government on saturday closed the dominican border and 
barred civilians from carrying weapons officials gave no reason 
for the border closure but there has been talk of worry about the 
possibility of armed mercenaries crossing the border to disrupt the 
election 
the army urged calm and serenity and said it would take 
whatever measures necessary to ensure a safe election 
the government led by president ertha pascaltrouillot also 
prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages during the election 
period and restricted traffic on sunday to cars with election 
permits and a few bus and taxi companies 
on saturday white vans flying blueandwhite united nations 
flags ferried international election monitors around the city 
police stopped cars on john brown avenue the main thoroughfare 
and checked for registration papers but the security forces were 
mostly out of sight 
there were 800 international observers in haiti for the 
elections 
it looks as far as anyone can tell aok said ismael 
diallo of the african nation of burkina faso spokesman for the 
130member un monitoring team which includes 64 unarmed military 
security advisers 
i regret now that i didnt register to vote in october but i 
was too afraid said huguette pierre 24 an unemployed 
switchboard operator 
haitis last attempt to hold democratic elections on nov 29 
1987 was aborted when assassins supported by the army shot and 
hacked to death at least 34 people at polling stations and in the 
streets 
subsequent elections in january 1988 were controlled by the army 
and boycotted by most leading contenders in the previous election 
the only disturbance so far in this campaign was a 
grenadeandbomb attack dec 5 that killed seven people and wounded 
more than 50 others at a campaign rally for the rev jeanbertrand 
aristide the apparent frontrunner among the 11 presidential 
candidates 
the electoral council revising earlier estimates said saturday 
that 2970000 people or about 90 percent of those eligible were 
registered to vote 
the electoral council said it did not expect to release any 
results before noon monday 
aristide a leftist roman catholic priest with a large following 
among the majority poor was considered a frontrunner 
although the army has pledged to ensure a smooth election 
sympathizers of the fallen 29year duvalier dictatorship oppose any 
move toward democratic government 
last week the selfproclaimed head of the tonton macoute 
militia vowed to prevent an aristide victory 
we will do everything to prevent this danger said roger 
lafontant who himself was barred from contesting the election 
my country will never be delivered to communism 
the tonton macoutes violently nforced the duvalier dictatorship 
for 29 years 
haiti an impoverished caribbean nation of 6 million people has 
been ruled almost exclusively by despots since gaining independence 
from france in 1804 after a slave revolt 
aristide 37 was expelled from his ecclesiastical order in 1988 
for allegedly preaching class struggle 
another popular condidate is former world bank official marc 
bazin seen as a favorite of the bush administration because of his 
international business ties 
aristides antiimperialist rhetoric has made us officials 
wary but he has presented a moderate though somewhat vague 
election platform calling for a dignified relationship between 
the two countries

a new breed of hightech radio programmers 
think theyve found a better way to give music junkies nearperfect 
renditions of their favorite hits from beethoven to billy idol 24 
hours a day 
its called digital radio and one day it may be zipping out of 
earth orbit directly to your car or portable radio or through your 
tv set 
what digital radio promises is impressive no more hissing 
signals fading in and out or booming from the bottom of a barrel 
no pops or crackles compact discquality sound 
several new satellite companies want to offer it so do 
traditional am and fm radio stations some cable companies already 
are offering digital radio to subscribers for a price 
because digital radio can produce such a clear sound the 
recording industry is keeping a wary eye on a technology that may 
spur home taping 
but many observers think theres no stopping it 
todays radio no longer is state of the art sound quality 
says robert mazer a washington communications lawyer 
digital radio transforms sound into the precise binary pulses of 
computers whereas traditional analog radio changes sound into 
electrical signals transmitted as rising and falling waves of 
energy 
computer technology can reconstruct digital signals into sound 
that is a nearperfect copy of the original material which in the 
music industry nowadays typically is a digital compact disc 
testing is under way in japan canada and europe on 
satellitedelivered digital radio in this country the federal 
communications commission is considering whether to set aside a 
portion of the already overcrowded airwaves for digital audio 
broadcasting 
whatever happens the new system may render existing radios 
obsolete 
some entrepreneurs are hoping to carve out a market for digital 
audio carried over the unused portions of a cable tv systems 
wires the idea has been spreading across the nation slowly since 
may when jerrold communications rolled out its 17channel digital 
cable radio 
two other cable radio offerings digital planet and digital 
music express were demonstrated last month to a cable tv 
convention in anaheim calif 
carson califbased digital planet began marketing its 
26channel service to a limited number of continental cablevision 
subscribers in los angeles in september continental is charging 
customers 8 for the service which offers formats including rock 
classical and jazz along with radio and cable simulcasts and 
several regular radio stations some channels have commercials 
customers get a tuner that is connected between the incoming 
cable and their stereo receiver where the digital signal is 
converted back into analog with only a slight decrease in sound 
quality 
although some might wonder why people would pay for what now is 
offered basically free on traditional radio digital planet 
president william delany said subscriber response has been just 
marvelous 
there are people out there willing to pay a little extra for 
highquality sound delany said in a telephone interview from 
anaheim 
delany said his company originally had projected 2 million 
subscribers within two years but based upon the early results in 
los angeles the service may attract double that number in two 
years he said 
jerry rubinstein chairman of international cablecasting 
technologies inc in new york said his company has commitments for 
the 30channel digital music express from cable systems 
representing 15 million subscribers in denver las vegas nev 
chicago seattle san francisco and st louis rubinstein said it 
should begin in spring 1991 
the music will be commercial free and uninterrupted rubinstein 
said a computer even will arrange the order in which songs are 
played 
unlike digital planet which will have moderators telling 
listeners what theyre hearing digital music express will offer an 
optional remote control that displays the name of the artist the 
song album title record company and catalog number 
the subscriber will have all the information he wants to buy 
the cd be it by phone call or by going into a particular record 
store to get it rubinstein said 
the cable radio executives said they didnt want to alienate the 
record companies for that reason they wont publish advance play 
lists or play albums end to end 
the recording industry still fears the introduction of digital 
audiotape recorders particularly when digital radios begin picking 
up digital audio broadcasts to offset the potential loss of 
revenues record manufacturers want a performance royalty or a tax 
on tapes or recorders 
the us copyright office is looking into the issue it also is 
considering a proposal that digital radio broadcasts be scrambled 
thereby turning them into subscriptiononly services 
radio stations are urging the fcc to let them provide digital 
audio arguing that satellite delivery would weaken the tenets of 
the 1934 communications act that enshrines the concept of 
localism 
radio stations also say satellites would siphon away crucial 
revenue 
satellite broadcasters want to use portions of the radio 
spectrum now occupied by uhftv channels 5766 broadcasters say 
that spectrum should be reserved for emerging highdefinition tv 
service 
finding space for digital broadcasts also is going to be a 
problem since digital signals use more of the airwaves than 
analog

lou saltz is collecting washington apples 
2100 cases for troops in the persian gulf its one way to let 
them know were thinking of them says the unemployed truck 
driver 
bill slivinski is sending 4000 pounds of macrame kits i had 
an awful lot of friends that were in the vietnam war the new 
englander says 
becky pickelman packed two pallets full of games treats and 
toiletries donated by fellow texans maybe the troops will feel 
better knowing that people in the states care says the 
29yearold walmart worker 
all across america selfappointed christmas elves have 
collected cartons of good cheer for the soldiers who will spend 
their holidays in the saudi arabian desert 
theyre sending everything from soup to nuts literally 
the soup for example came from campbells it was among the 
items rounded up by jerry meese a spray painter in michigan city 
ind 
the phones just keep ringing said lt col henry wyatt of 
the defense logistics agency the agency has four people manning a 
hotline to coordinate largescale donations to the troops in the 
persian gulf 
were not soliciting these things wyatt said people just 
say hey id like to donate the following 
many of the largest contributions come from corporate donors and 
charitable organizations 
but throughout the country individuals are setting aside their 
own problems to show their support for the 250000 troops in saudi 
arabia 
in brewster wash saltz says he and his wife yuvonne are 
just truck drivers the couple saw stories on tv about groups 
sending gifts to the gulf and decided washington should send 
apples 
its something to do he says neither of us is working 
right now 
saltz and his wife use a borrowed truck to collect donations 
from local fruit warehouses and then drove them 150 miles to 
fairchild air force base for the flight to the gulf 
in athol mass 72yearold al souza has a living room loaded 
with gulfbound items ranging from sardines and toilet paper to 
dart games and volleyballs 
my wife just had surgery and oh jesus im telling you ive 
been busy says the american legion commander and world war ii 
veteran but he adds when i was overseas i wished id gotten 
some of these things 
the defense logistics agency reports that hundreds of groups 
individuals and companies have donated millions of dollars in goods 
and services for operation desert shield 
nothing like this happened in korea or vietnam says lt 
col wyatt 
people who donate large quantities of items arrange to get the 
material to defense department depots on the east or west coast 
and the government takes care of shipments from there most items 
go by sea and take 30 days to reach saudi arabia 
yet with the deadline for christmas shipments now past calls to 
the donations hotline show no signs of slowing down wyatt said 
some wellintentioned items have been turned away including 
offers of lobster bottled water and live christmas trees but the 
variety of items accepted includes a broad variety of foods and 
novelty items ranging from klika toys to klondike bars 
even stock brokers are getting involved gordon platt a ghm 
inc specialists clerk on the floor of the american stock 
exchange collected enough donations from his colleagues to buy 
1200 tins of cookies then he rented a truck and delivered them to 
a defense department depot in pennsylvania 
i just felt i wanted to do what i could to bring the holidays 
a little closer to these guys said platt who has some friends 
among the troops 
becky pickelman feels blessed to have her husband and family 
with her at christmas but she sympathizes with walmart coworkers 
in new braunfels texas whose loved ones are stationed in the 
gulf 
we pretty much saw what they were going through knowing that 
they are here alone and their husbands uncles and brothers are 
alone there she said 
so mrs pickelman and her friends arranged to run some free 
radio and newspaper ads and rounded up cartons full of candy 
stationery games and food 
its going to cut it close but they should be getting them 
the week before christmas she said recently 
in illinois half the students at flossmoor high school came to 
school on the columbus day holiday to make boutineers for troops in 
the gulf the football team arrived en masse other school and 
community groups did likewise 
the kids were incredible said school spokeswoman jayne 
mathews it was a great day to get all these people together 
in massachusetts 46yearold slivinski said he knew just what 
he should do to aid the gulf effort as president of pepperell 
braiding co he arranged to send the troops kits of macramestyle 
knotting projects 
its the same stuff that sailors did in the 1600s 1500s and 
even 1400s on sailing vessels he said

the czechoslovak airline csa on sunday 
became the first foreign airline to resume flights to beirut since 
the city was reunified and the warring militias withdrawn 
civil aviation sources said a csa tupolev jet carrying 65 
passengers landed at beirut in the morning resuming the airlines 
weekly service after a threeyear suspension 
the soviet aeroflot bulgarias balkan airlines and syrian arab 
airlines were the only carriers to maintain flights to beirut in 
recent years most of the others suspended their flights after 
terrorist attacks by moslem shiite extremists in 1984 
security conditions have improved in beirut since the 
reunification of the city and the withdrawal of warring moslem and 
christian militias 
reunification was the first step in an arab leaguebrokered plan 
to end lebanons 15 years of civil war 
civil aviation sources said they were hopeful that western 
airlines would resume flights to beirut next year

a kgb official speaking at a moscow factory 
last year was asked why mikhail gorbachev was surrounded by two 
rows of worriedlooking guys trying to look in all directions 
his answer according to soviet news reports was that there 
is terrorism and there are all kinds of psychological disorders 
resulting from constant stress 
the kremlin in other words is getting a taste of its own 
medicine 
after supporting international terrorism for decades to 
destabilize the united states and its allies the soviet leadership 
is being confronted with a growing wave of terrorist activity from 
within us counterterrorism experts say 
the same political relaxation that has given birth to 
unprecedented democratic reforms in the 15 soviet republics also 
has lifted the lid on longrepressed aspirations and grievances 
the result has been a general breakdown of law and order 
ranging from new yorkstyle muggings to sophisticated political 
terrorism 
the terrorists run the gamut from nationalists seeking 
independence for their republics to groups distressed by worsening 
economic shortages to individuals unable to cope with the rapid 
changes in soviet society 
the kgb the countrys internal security agency is taking the 
lead in handling the threat but the problem is bedeviling 
gorbachev and the central leadership and theyre hard pressed to 
respond said dick combs a staff member of the senate armed 
services committee who studies the political implications of 
terrorism 
intelligence files made available by the new governments of 
eastern europe are confirming longheld suspicions of western 
counterterrorism officials the sovietled communist bloc 
supported and in some cases sponsored palestinian european and 
south american terrorism 
for example the communist government of east germany knew of 
plans by libyanbacked agents to bomb a discotheque in west berlin 
four years ago according to dennis pluchinsky of the state 
departments bureau of diplomatic security the 1986 attack killed 
one american serviceman and led to a us bombing raid on libya 
but now that the threat has turned against them soviet leaders 
have been eager to cooperate with the west in countering 
international terrorism american officials say 
and they also have asked for help to combat their domestic 
threat said one official western agencies however have turned 
them down citing reluctance to entangle themselves with domestic 
soviet strife said the official who spoke only on condition of 
anonymity 
the list of incidents is long it is made more startling by the 
new openness of the media which as recently as last year was 
banned from publishing any news of attacks on authorities 
in the caucasus nationalists blew up railroad cars and tracks 
several times last summer for two years running the may day 
ceremonies in moscow have been disrupted by political malcontents 
throwing firebombs the soviet airline aeroflot suffered 13 
hijackings or attempted hijackings last summer and has received 
more than 100 bomb threats this year 
yuri plekhanov head of the kgb unit that protects gorbachev 
said recently that every month his agents arrest more than 10 
citizens with criminal intentions 
the head of the kgb in the ukraine nm golushko said recently 
that one cannot ignore the real danger of nuclear terrorism 
attacks on nuclear plants and crimes committed using radioactive 
material 
although counterterrorism measures have been introduced they 
have been impeded by the governments progressively enfeebled grip 
on society said gabriel schoenfeld a senior fellow at the 
center for strategic and international studies in washington 
schoenfeld an expert on internal soviet affairs said attempts 
to control the threat have been further hampered by backward 
technology and shortage of everything from walkietalkies to metal 
detectors 
for example the police need 900000 batteries every year yet 
central planners in moscow have promised only 150000 for 1990 he 
said 
for the time being the terrorist threat may be checked by the 
very flaws that created it 
the unreliable telephone and travel network presents 
difficulties for planners of terrorist incidents so do the strict 
controls still in place on internal travel and the lowtechnology 
weaponry available on the black market 
but further liberalization could benefit terrorists schoenfeld 
said 
in the meantime soviet officials are coming clean about past 
support for terrorists said the state departments pluchinsky 
they have said for example that the notorious marxist radical 
known as carlos who terrorized europe in the 1970s in the pay of 
palestinian groups was granted asylum in communist hungary

days before a scheduled meeting of 
cambodias warring factions the khmer rouge on sunday accused 
vietnam and the government it installed in phnom penh of trying to 
destroy a un peace framework 
the vietnamese enemy aggressors and their traitorous lackey 
puppets are more arrogantly manipulating to block peace efforts 
khmer rouge radio said 
a translation of the broadcast was seen in bangkok 
the five permanent members of the un security council the 
united states the soviet union britain china and france agreed 
on a draft framework for cambodian peace in late november 
but despite international efforts cambodian premier hun sens 
government and the three guerrilla armies fighting it have made few 
strides toward reconciliation 
the communist khmer rouge is the strongest guerrilla faction 
hun sen has agreed to meet the guerrillas in paris friday to 
discuss the security council document but both he and vietnam have 
indicated they are unhappy with it 
vietnam on friday called the draft a violation of the goal and 
principles of the un charter and said it had no essential 
points that may lead to consensus 
it also said it did not deal with the need to eliminate 
forever the genocidal regime of the khmer rouge which ruled by 
terror before vietnams invasion in 1979 ended its 3year regime 
the security council plan envisions a large un peacekeeping 
role in general elections the original version was proposed in 
late august and agreed to in principle by the cambodian factions 
but hun sen has said since that the military contingent proposed 
under the plan should not be a peacekeeping force or a heavily 
armed fighting unit 
he also has insisted that the un supervision of key phnom penh 
ministries under the plan be limited 
hun sen has agreed to meet the guerrillas as a member of the 
supreme national council conceived under the un plan and made up 
of representatives from all four factions 
its only meeting in bangkok in midseptember broke up after it 
failed to agree on the role of guerrilla coalition leader prince 
norodom sihanouk 
a brief report on noncommunist guerrilla radio sunday quoted 
sources in paris as saying sihanouk had decided he no longer would 
accept the chairmanship or membership on the council

bill drengler has the grim task this holiday 
season of writing wills for soldiers being prepared for duty in the 
persian gulf 
its an ironic task for a man who 20 years ago dropped out of 
the reserve officers training corps and opposed us involvement 
in the vietnam war feeling he owed his country he joined the 
national guard as a lawyer 18 months ago 
the more i do this the more it is hitting home to me that i 
may not see some of these faces again if the gulf situation blows 
up a somber drengler said 
he said he remembers the gripping images of the vietnam war on 
television as if it happened yesterday asked if those memories 
made his guard assignment more difficult drengler a first 
lieutenant paused several seconds 
it probably makes it harder he said i had friends who 
came home dead 
drengler 41 is one of 17 guard lawyers in wisconsin assigned 
to advise soldiers activated for operation desert shield the us 
troop buildup in the persian gulf that followed iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait 
capt scott meske a military spokesman in madison said 300 
wisconsin national guard soldiers are in saudi arabia and 700 
others are being trained at fort mccoy for likely duty there 
in all the united states has at least 230000 soldiers 
marines sailors and airmen in saudi arabia and is sending about 
200000 more 
capt terence mcardle assistant staff judge advocate for the 
wisconsin national guard in madison estimated his officers have 
written up to 2000 wills for guard members military reservists 
and their spouses since the callup began in august he said he has 
done about 200 himself 
it does get to you in time there is no question about that 
mcardle said you realize the consequences that these people are 
facing 
a united nations resolution authorizes the use of force after 
jan 15 if iraq doesnt withdraw from kuwait 
drengler whose fulltime job is as corporation counsel for 
marathon county needed waivers because of his age before the guard 
accepted his enlistment last year 
in college he dropped out of air force rotc in 1969 
like many people of my age of that generation i had 
reservations about the vietnam experience he said he said he 
was vocal in his opposition but wasnt a brickthrowing 
protester or anything like that 
over time he has moved back toward the military including 
serving as chairman of the marathon county draft board 
i generally believe we should perform some sort of national 
service drengler said sitting in front of a small american flag 
tacked on an office wall above pictures of his three children 
most soldiers have confronted the possibility of being killed 
before they talk to him about a will he said but he conceded the 
document reinforces the realities of combat 
most of them really do exhibit a more positive attitude than 
you might imagine he said a portion of them do act like they 
are in a bit of a daze 
spouses show the most emotion he said some are scared some 
are upbeat and some are angry 
more than half the soldiers called up need wills and almost all 
sign one drengler said he said he has helped arrange at least 
100 
i always try to tell these people that writing a will 
doesnt mean you have one foot closer to the grave he said 
what it really means is you have thought about your family and 
planned for any eventuality as basic as that may sound it seems 
to lend some sort of reassurance

islamic conservatives are 
complaining about how the country is run and questioning the wisdom 
of letting hundreds of thousands of foreign troops into the 
country saudi and diplomatic sources report 
the sources point to several incidents in which the muttawa or 
religious police have cracked down on what they consider 
unacceptable behavior in this theocratic islamic state 
conservatives have not dared criticize the ruling alsaud family 
by name but a muttawa officer recently gave a princess a public 
tonguelashing for the way her foreign maid was dressed 
a muttawa raiding party recently scaled the wall of a perfume 
manufacturers mansion in jiddah after apparently being told there 
were unmarried women and liquor at a party there 
the muttawa usually armed with sticks but sometimes with guns 
took along an islamic judge who gave some partygoers jail sentences 
of up to two years

who translated for king fahd during president bushs thanksgiving 
visit 
a diplomatic party in riyadh was raided by the muttawa in 
november 
unislamic behavior like the consumption of alcohol mixed 
socializing and immodest dress are particular targets 
saudi arabias ruling princes must balance demands from the 
grassroots moslem puritans who brought the alsaud family to power 
and the desire for change among the educated elite 
some liberals have come to believe the presence of so many 
foreigners can accelerate change in a kingdom that has clung 
doggedly to islamic tradition 
four months after western troops arrived a backlash may be 
developing 
underground cassettes criticize the government they ask 
indirect questions about state spending and use historical 
allegories to make political points 
one says an 11th century islamic king in spain invited a 
stronger king to protect him against a third and the stronger king 
decided to stay in other words it is questioning whether us 
troops will leave when asked 
the tapes cite us studies during the arab oil embargo in 1973 
on how to take over the oilfields lending support to a theory that 
washington planned the current crisis for that purpose 
questions are being asked about the estimated 200 billion spent 
on defense despite a hightech arsenal the saudi military was not 
able to confront saddam hussein when he took kuwait 
that prompted government announcements that the army had been 
ordered not to fight iraq in order to avoid spilling the blood of 
fellow arabs 
after fahd invited the americans and their allies to defend the 
kingdom he sought a ruling or fatwa from religious scholars that 
islamic law allowed the use of nonmoslems soldiers in times of 
peril 
they couldnt criticize the deployment of foreign forces 
because the king wanted it a longterm arab resident said 
like everyone else interviewed he spoke on condition of 
anonymity due to the sensitive nature of political issues 
last month about 40 women drove cars through the capital in 
unprecedented protest of a ban on women driving 
zealous mullahs or clergymen responded that the women should 
be divorced and publicly flogged for defying tradition some tried 
to link the event to the american embassy by circulating an 
invitation to a dinner dance there another taboo that allegedly 
was found in a drivers purse 
the atmosphere in the country is charged a saudi official 
said the liberals are demanding more say in the government and 
the conservatives are saying were being run over 
no public means of debate is available the press is muzzled and 
political parties are illegal 
people who are westernized dont have a forum to meet and 
exert pressure the longtime resident noted the other group 
has heritage institutions a party line so theyll always have an 
edge in the struggle diplomats say the religious element is not 
a focused opposition likely to oust the king as happened in iran 
in 1979 the royal family has the power to put on the brakes a 
western envoy observed 
warrior predecessors of the zealots the ikhwan or brothers 
who helped unify the kingdom in the 1920s tried to rebel against 
king abdul aziz in 1929 he crushed them 
islams two holiest sites mecca and medina are in saudi arabia 
and a king who uses the title the custodian of the two holy mosques 
cannot ignore religious issues 
how can you claim to be the custodian of the two holy mosques 
and bring in an idea that clashes with the islamic sharia said 
an islamic scholar referring to religious law its too 
sensitive 
princes in important government posts acknowledge that some 
questioning is valid but said most critics dont understand the 
iraqi threat 
the people who are really against foreign troops have no 
ground to stand on a ranking prince said he claimed they had no 
effect on public opinion

rear adm riley d mixson 
commander of the us navy task force in the red sea says saddam 
hussein is acting as if hes preparing for war so mixson is doing 
likewise 
the admiral a decorated vietnam war combat pilot said the 
iraqi president should think long and hard before confronting 
the usled multinational force in the gulf region 
all we see from saddams side is that hes sending more 
troops to kuwait hes showing no signs of withdrawal mixson 
said at a weekend briefing aboard the aircraft carrier uss john f 
kennedy in the northern red sea hes dispersing his forces and 
acting as if hes preparing for war 
but he said i have never known of an adversary to be in such 
a disadvantageous position as he is right now 
as mixson spoke the thud of a6 attack bombers a7 light 
attack aircraft and f14 fighters landing on the kennedys flight 
deck reverberated through the carrier a normal carrier wing 
includes about 70 combat aircraft 
mixson said he hoped for peace but was braced for war 
those of us in the military hope more probably than anyone 
else in the world for a peaceful resolution he said but i 
would say its no better than a 5050 chance for peace and 
maybe a little worse than that 
the biggest us naval fleet since world war ii is assembling in 
the gulf region by jan 15 the un deadline for iraq to pull 
out of kuwait or face possible use of force the united states 
will have three carriers in the red sea and three in the persian 
gulf said cmdr jack ahart the kennedys operations officer 
if war comes he said two carriers would deploy roundtheclock 
combat flights while the third would remain on standby 
mixson said he believed that in the event of allout conflict 
air power would be very very decisive but he said it wouldnt 
singlehandedly win a war 
there are those who say that well bring them to their knees 
in two weeks there are others who think it might go on a little 
longer he said 
they iraq certainly are a warexperienced nation i think if 
we do get into a ground war that could get very very bloody and i 
hope that we can avoid that with an allout assault said 
mixson 
mixson said iraqi air tactics have become more sophisticated 
since the 19801988 iraniraq war 
theyre practicing more at night he said they understand 
the threat that hes up against he saddam understands that

the czechoslovaks are the 
smallest ground contingent in the multinational force deployed in 
the saudi desert but their presence is a sign of tremendous 
changes in the world order 
the 170 czechoslovaks who form a chemical decontamination unit 
completed their deployment this weekend it is the first time in 
decades that czechoslovak troops are serving outside the former 
east bloc 
we are here with our small force to defend peace in this 
area said maj ivan pavlov this is a great experience for us 
we are here to cooperate with the americans and the saudis 
desert warfare is a strange new notion for the czechoslovak 
troops whose caps are constructed with earflaps to keep them warm 
during harsh eastern european winters 
this is the first time since world war ii czechoslovak troops 
have gone overseas and the first time we have ever been in the 
desert said pavlov 
he and his countrymen were officially welcomed by saudi lt gen 
khalid bin sultan commander of all the arab forces and nephew of 
king fahd at the welcoming ceremony saturday night czechoslovak 
soldiers stood at attention in formation on a saudi basketball 
court 
with the toppling of czechoslovakias communist government in a 
peaceful revolution last year czechoslovaks have a new role to 
play in the world pavlov said 
that includes close cooperation with western countries viewed as 
the enemy by their former government 
it is a very big change for us said pavlov 
he said czechoslovakia too has a stake in resolving the 
persian gulf crisis 
if we dont stop saddam hussein now there will be war in the 
middle east and maybe in the world pavlov said 
high oil prices brought on by the gulf crisis are already 
causing hardship in czechoslovakia which is struggling with the 
difficult transition to a market economy 
in the saudi desert the czechoslovak chemicaldecontamination 
unit stands ready to decontaminate vehicles equipment and 
airstrips if they fall under attack from chemical weapons 
the unit made up of five different detachments will remain in 
eastern saudi arabia for 10 months officers said 
this is a very dangerous job we must be prepared said 
pavlov

two german scientists who visited iraq say 
president saddam hussein has acquired enough western technology to 
produce a nuclear bomb in 1991 or 1992 the sunday times reported 
the newspaper quoted scientists bruno stemmler and walter busse 
as saying iraqi scientists had built a factory northwest of baghdad 
for producing nuclear centrifuges which are essential for making 
weaponsgrade uranium 
the scientists said the iraqis also had built a 
uraniumenrichment laboratory in the southern outskirts of the 
capital 
stemmler visited iraq in the fall of 1987 and he and busse went 
there together in the summer of 1988 the report said both were 
then employed by man technologie of the former west germany and 
were in iraq to advise on its nuclear program 
based on the information the newspaper said iraq could have 
nuclear capability next year or the year after at least three 
years sooner than western intelligence agencies had previously 
thought 
even if saddam were to withdraw his forces from kuwait his 
nuclear capability will shortly pose a deadly serious threat to 
stability in the region the report said 
the sunday times said technology for the two plants was provided 
by at least a dozen western companies wich filled orders from 
iraqi firms that were cover operations for securing nuclear weapons 
knowhow 
the viennabased international atomic energy agency failed to 
discover the existence of the laboratory when its representatives 
visited iraq last month the report said

soldiers patrolled major cities sunday 
following two days of rioting prompted by demands for higher wages 
and government opponents insisted the death toll was higher than 
the official figure of five 
unconfirmed claims from union leaders and human rights groups 
asserted that anywhere from 25 to more than 100 people had been 
killed in the city of fez 
the government said rioting friday in fez killed five people 
including a policeman and injured 127 people mostly police a 
hospital supervisor in fez dr hassan houari said sunday the 
government figures were accurate 
scores of people were reported injured in other cities during a 
nationwide oneday general strike friday to demand higher wages 
the violence continued in fez on saturday with arson attacks on 
vehicles and a police station but there were no reports of renewed 
clashes 
major cities were reported calm but uneasy sunday with security 
forces deployed at major intersections and guarding public 
buildings in fez charred buses lay in the streets and soldiers in 
armored vehicles patrolled areas where looting had occurred 
a few minor disturbances including stonethrowing and 
spontaneous demonstrations were reported in fez and rabat late 
saturday and early sunday 
in paris human rights groups that monitor events in morocco 
claimed the death toll was far higher than the government figure 
one of them the action committee for the liberation of moroccan 
political prisoners said 80 people were killed and about 1000 
arrested the government reported 210 arrests 
the unions which organized the general strike vowed to combat 
government terrorism they said the violence resulted because 
security forces resorted to intimidation provocation and 
repression 
the government however said police in fez suffered heavy 
casualties because they exercised restraint using warning shots 
tear gas and clubs to disperse rioters 
authorities said a policeman was fatally stabbed when his unit 
was surrounded by rioters and a civilian was crushed to death by 
stampeding protesters during a police charge 
fez the religious and intellectual center of morocco suffered 
extensive damage from looting and arson the national news agency 
map said looters armed with chains and iron bars ransacked jewelry 
stores banks and public buildings 
the rioters set about 50 buses and cars on fire and burned the 
deluxe merindes hotel the agency said it said some rioters 
reached a lounge on the fifth floor of the hotel and carried off 
the stocks of liquor 
the unions claimed 80 percent of workers observed the strike 
call the government which had tried to ban the strike said only 
a handful of businesses and factories were affected 
but authorities confirmed the strike was widely observed on 
university campuses where at least 40 percent of classes were 
canceled 
the estimated 20000 protesters in fez included many university 
students and other youths according to official figures the 
unemployment rate for moroccans under 21 has risen to 31 percent 
compared with an overall rate of 16 percent 
albayane a communist opposition newspaper said sunday that 
hotels and luxury shops were attacked because young demonstrators 
resented a widening gap between moroccos rich and poor 
government policy has given morocco an image of crisis and 
grave weakness albayane said its high time for change 
thousands of workers who took part in general strikes in 1979 
and 1981 were fired or arrested the 1981 strike led to riots in 
casablanca in which at least 66 people were killed

nearly 200000 towards the security he has needed since the 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini called for his death for allegedly 
blaspheming islam 
rushdie has ben in hiding since the iranian revolutionary 
leader issued the death call in february 1989 saying rushdies 
novel the satanic verses defamed the religion 
in a statement through his lawyer rushdie said he had decided 
to break his silence about the financing of his protection because 
of new suggestions and allegations about it 
the sunday express quoted colleagues of rushdies police guards 
as saying the officials have to pay rushdie toward their 
accommodation and food at the privately rented hideouts 
in the statement lawyer bernard simon said it was time to set 
the record straight on the financing of rushdies protection 
mr rushdie was advised at the outset of his protection that 
he would be required personally to bear most of the cost of the 
accommodation provided for him this he gladly agreed to do he 
said 
the protection has now been in force for over 22 months and 
during this period mr rushdies own financial contribution to the 
costs of his protection has been in the region of 100000 pounds 
193000

risks being killed if he makes further public appearances 
dr shabir akthar of the bradford council of mosques a major 
moslem forum said in a bbc interview that british moslems were not 
officially calling for rushdies death 
but britains moslem community was very diverse he said it 
does not take all its direction from any single authority and 
individuals may take the law into their own hands

john major changed little of substance in his 
international debut in europe as the new british prime minister 
but by the end of it everything seemed different 
the battles of margaret thatchers era just three weeks past 
were a fading memory as the mildmannered major cautiously nudged 
britain toward an end to its long isolation in the european 
community 
major 47 arrived at the twoday european community summit with 
one big advantage in the eyes of the 11 other leaders bruised by 
the bitter confrontations with britain over european union he 
wasnt mrs thatcher 
the position of the new british government could be summed up 
by saying they feel they are europeans commented west german 
chancellor helmut kohl 
from kohl a powerful world figure to leaders of small 
countries like irelands prime minister charles haughey the others 
went out of their way to welcome the man who replaced the western 
worlds longest serving leader 
major came to rome a virtually unknown to most of the them 
hovering diffidently on the edge of the photo lineups in which the 
mrs thatcher traditionally stood centerstage 
occasionally there was a recognition problem italian officials 
said they searched for major to say goodbye at the end of fridays 
night banquet at the renaissance chigi palace and then found hed 
left unnoticed 
in contrast to the robust exchanges with mrs thatcher that 
marked most summits major ran out of superlatives saturday to 
describe the atmosphere among the 12 ec leaders extremely good 
very friendly extremely positive 
we intend to be wholeheartedly engaged in the enterprise 
of building shaping and developing europe he said 
italian officials enthused that all 12 are on board kohl 
and major were on firstname terms before the end of their first 
oneonone meeting 
the german leader explained that he was pressing for european 
union partly to allay fears of the newly united germany in a 
continent ravaged by world war ii 
major the first british leader too young to remember any of the 
193945 conflict replied tactfully that most people of my 
generation and younger take a very positive view of the 
community 
at least for now his new style seemed to open a new era 
but underneath the smiles and the unassuming demeanor major 
stuck to mrs thatchers fundamental objections to radical plans 
for a single european currency and closer political ties that could 
lead to a federaltype europe 
mrs thatcher said neither she nor the british parliament would 
accept that kind of loss of sovereignty 
but it was the way mrs thatcher said it that precipitated her 
downfall after a confrontation over single currency plans at the 
last community summit in october her deputy geoffrey howe 
resigned accusing mrs thatcher of undermining britains national 
interest howes move provoked a leadership challenge 
the currency plan starting with a single central bank by 1994 
is still ticking away with latent british disapproval it is the 
most ominous of the potential time bombs the community leaders left 
behind after the second rome summit 
the other major sign that the honeymoon could soon be over was 
the alloptionsincluded communique on political union that 
appeared designed not to offend anyone 
it encompassed the profederalists hopes for the community to 
take over a whole range of domestic matters such as health and 
education to britains distinctly more modest ideas 
these include closer cooperation on foreign and defense policy 
and giving the communitys executive body the european commission 
the power to monitor community spending and implementation of 
jointly made decisions 
two intergovernmental conferences that began saturday are 
charged with turning this over next year into final proposals 
everyone can accept before then many analysts believe the 
honeymoon could be over 
major has remained loyal to mrs thatcher the leader who 
plucked him from an simple bench in parliament and appointed him to 
a series of senior posts 
but just at the end of the summit when a reporter suggested 
that mrs thatcher was wrong when she slighted a british compromise 
proposal on the single currency major gave an inch who can 
tell he said

the welcome sign at the border of this 
small cape cod town reads settled by pilgims in 1644 
but archaeologists have found evidence the date is really 8000 
years before that when ancestors of todays indians formed a 
settlement here 
unusually high tides last month sliced through 15 feet of sandy 
dunes on coast guard beach part of the cape cod national seashore 
the tide uncovered what archaeologists say is a portion of the 
oldest undisturbed example of a prehistoric settlement ever found 
in the northeast 
we consider it kind of a miniature pompeii said mike 
whatley the parks supervisory ranger 
but with more high tides expected on new years eve the seaside 
window into the past could quickly close so a team of 
archaeologists is frantically working in freezing temperatures and 
high winds to excavate the site 
its an emergency excavation just about everyone on our 
payroll is down here said linda towle archaeology supervisor 
for the national park services north atlantic region 
in their rush to save the treasure buried on the beach the 
scientists have yet to spend much time evaluating what theyve 
found 
they believe however that the area was used about 8000 years 
ago by a small group of people who moved from one place to another 
depending on the season 
ice covered all of new england until about 15000 years ago 
after the glaciers retreated scientists say the first human 
beings started arriving 10000 to 12000 years ago 
arrowheads and spear points found at the site indicate that this 
particular group of cape codders was made up of hunters most 
likely of deer moose and bear 
the dim outline of post holes apparently part of a wall 
suggests a shelter was constructed using saplings stuck into the 
ground and covered with reed mats bark or fur a pond just to the 
south would have furnished water and freshwater fish towle said 
they were fully evolved human beings she said they are 
racially the ancestors of the american indians who were here when 
the europeans arrived 
although cape code is now a popular site for summer homes the 
settlers appear to have built their homes for winter use 
park service rules limit excavation of sites unless they are 
threatened so the archaeologists here dont have carte blanche to 
dig up the entire area whatley said it is believed that the 
settlement extended over several acres somewhat larger than the 
area that was uncovered by the tide 
the settlement was four miles from the ocean because the sea 
level was significantly lower and the eroded dunes show that the 
landscape then formed a valley that would have sheltered the 
encampment from the elements 
the archaeologists conjecture that the group went from the 
settlement to the sea to gather shellfish but either ate it there 
or shucked it and returned with just the meat no seashells or 
shell fragments have been found at the site 
archaeologist gerald kelso noted the settlement is a reminder 
that other people were in the area centuries before the pilgrims 
arrived from europe 
our history was written by europeans so you have this story 
of the hardy pioneers settling virgin territory he said it 
wasnt and it hadnt been for 10000 years before they got here 
it is not the first time archaeologists have had to race to save 
important sites from cape cods prehistory 
a 7000yearold site in mashpee was bulldozed to make way for a 
golf course in 1987 when artifacts were found by a homeowner 
digging a septic tank in 1982 scientists were given just three 
days to excavate there spear points arrowheads and flakes from 
toolmaking were uncovered while developers were bulldozing land for 
a subdivision in 1988 
most of the prehistoric settlements that have been found had 
been disturbed by plows in the late 1800s and early 1900s the 
excavation on the beach was not because the sandy conditions above 
it made farming difficult

boxes containing millions of sterile 
screwworm flies will be dropped in northwestern libya as part of an 
international effort to eradicate the deadly insects and save 
northern africas livestock 
the project is a rare collaboration between the united states 
which developed the technology to stop the pests and the libyan 
government of col moammar gadhafi 
officials have sent leaflets and produced television spots for 
the sheepherding families in the region telling them to open the 
shoeboxsized containers to release the sterile flies and save 
their flocks 
in the test phase beginning this month boxes containing the 35 
million sterile screwworm flies are to be dropped once a week for 
eight weeks from libyan aircraft contracted by the united nations 
the 100 million effort aims to eradicate the screwworm flies 
from more than 8000 square miles of northwestern libya the idea 
is for the sterilized insects to mate with the screwworm flies 
already in the area sterile matings produce no offspring 
after a review a broader effort is scheduled to start in 
february then 100 million sterile flies will be dropped every 
week 
the boxes are designed to open on impact with the air releasing 
the sterile harmless flies but some may land unopened and thats 
where the information campaign comes in 
we need to inform the people said furat dridy the 
campaigns tunisian director they have to accept that the boxes 
are safe we ask the farmers and the children to open any closed 
boxes not to be afraid of them 
television spots and leaflets carrying messages in simple words 
and sketches advise people what to do during and after aerial 
releases 
in its first appearance outside the americas the screwworm was 
discovered in libya two years ago probably imported in meat or 
live animals from latin america 
the flesheating pest develops after a screwworm fly lays its 
eggs in a wound as small as a tick bite on any warmblooded animal 
including humans the larvae burrow in and as the wound enlarges 
the smell attracts other females the animal can die within days 
the eradication technique seeks to introduce into an area 10 
sterile males for every local female said hilmi toros spokesman 
for the un food and agriculture organization in rome the fao is 
organizing the project along with the un development program and 
other agencies 
because the female screwworm fly mates only once in a lifetime 
of three to six weeks matings with sterile males eventually 
eliminate the potentially disastrous infestation 
the program has been held up because of bureaucracy a slow 
response from nations to provide money and an initial refusal by 
the united states to deal with libya toros said 30 million has 
been pledged of the programs 100 million cost 
despite the programs fourmonth delay project director dan 
lindquist said the infested area has been restricted to 
northwestern libya 
many of the shepherds targeted in the propaganda campaign are 
illiterate but together with libyan veterinarians theyve helped 
contain the screwworms spread by regularly checking their animals 
and quickly treating wounds 
the infested zone starts about 25 miles east of the tunisian 
border and runs past tripoli along the mediterranean coast for 190 
miles the zone reaches 30 to 60 miles inland

housing secretary jack kemp predicted sunday 
the bush administration will find a way to preserve minorityonly 
scholarships that are linked to students financial needs 
the white house and justice departments are reviewing a 
controversial opinion from the education departments top civil 
rights official that cast doubt on the legality of racebased 
scholarships 
kemp speaking on cbstvs face the nation said like 
most americans i dont believe in racebased or religiousbased 
quotas 
but he added i do believe in affirmative efforts by colleges 
to open up opportunity to minorities and lowincome people 
it would be a mistake for the federal government to shut off 
federal aid to a college because its trying to promote 
opportunities for minorities based on need and minority status 
he said 
the dispute which has upset many college administrators and 
civil rights groups was triggered by an opinion circulated by 
michael williams the assistant education secretary for civil 
rights that federal law bars college scholarships predicated only 
on race he warned colleges could lose their eligibility for 
federal aid if they gave such scholarships 
but kemp said williams interpretation of the law did not rule 
out scholarships based on race as well as financial need 
i think that is what ultimately is going to be the case 
said kemp 
president bush said friday that he had asked his staff for a 
quick readout on that so we can make a determination 
top white house officials including chief of staff john h 
sununu say they were caught by surprise by williams stance which 
became public after he sent a letter to organizers of the football 
fiesta bowl in tempe ariz cautioning them about plans to provide 
200000 for minority scholarships at the university of louisville 
and university of alabama 
williams said the fiesta bowl itself could award the 
scholarships but the two schools could not do it themselves 
williams said last week he had talked with lower level white 
house officials beforehand 
a source said williams even held up his letter to the fiesta 
bowl organizers for a week before sending it out without approval 
from anyone in the white house 
bush a longtime backer of the united negro college fund 
angered civil rights leaders by vetoing a job discrimination bill a 
few weeks before the november elections bush said the bill would 
have forced employers to resort to hiring quotas which he opposes

the nations economy is undergoing a 
significant slowdown that is likely to persist through early 
1991 before turning around later next year treasury secretary 
nicholas brady said sunday 
i have been a little slow to declare national recession day 
brady said 
many private economists however have pronounced the economy in 
recession with layoffs rising and banks in trouble and with the 
retail sales housing and car markets down a recession is defined 
as a contraction of six months or more in the gross national 
product 
i think it is quite clear that economic activity in the fourth 
quarter of this year has slowed down brady said on nbctvs 
meet the press program how much we dont know yet but its 
a significant slowdown 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan told a house committee 
last month said that oilprice problems resulting from the military 
standoff in the persian gulf had helped push the economy into a 
meaningful downturn 
brady asked why he was reluctant to use the word recession 
said sunday he did not have all the figures for th quarter 
lets watch and see brady said maybe it will be i dont 
think its the end of the world even it we have a recession well 
pull back out of it again no big deal 
while optimistic about the us economy in the longterm brady 
said there was no point being unrealistic about the sluggish 
economy i expect that that will continue into the first quarter 
of this year 
we expect that during 1991 that it the economy will turn 
around and well be back on the growth path jobs investment 
during that year he added 
michael j boskin chairman of the presidents council of 
economic advisers also was confident about the future 
right now the best guess is the economy will be reviving 
sometime next year whether we will have a recession that lasts 
several quarters it should be mild and brief or we narrowly 
skirt it he said on abctvs this week with david brinkley 
bush administration officials blamed the persian gulf crisis for 
aggravating the downturn by jacking up oil prices and sapping 
consumer confidence 
i am obviously concerned about events in the persian gulf 
boskin said i think they have heavily influenced the shortterm 
impact on the economy 
after iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 oil prices rose sharply 
because of the cut in supplies caused by economic sanctions against 
iraq 
the economy is already feeling the effects of the situation in 
the gulf brady said i myself every american says well im 
just going to wait and see a little bit if i was going to buy a 
new car ill slow down on it 
moreover boskin said the government might have to borrow money 
to pay for operation desert shield 
congressional democrats say the cost of keeping as many as 
400000 us troops in the gulf could add up to 368 billion in 
fiscal year 1991 the bush administration intends to ask congress 
for 20 billion early next year house majority leader richard 
gephardt dmo said saturday 
president bush meantime is looking at a range of options to 
stimulate the economy including ways to lower the cost of capital 
and generate jobs boskin said 
brady and boskin said they both favored having the federal 
reserve drop interest rates to boost the economy i think there 
is ample room for a further reduction in interest rates brady 
said 
brady drew a distinction between the crisis in the banking 
industry and the situation with failed savings and loan 
institutions which is expected to cost taxpayers up to 100 
billion this year 
banks are not as healthy as we would like them he said 
the banks have 200 billion worth of capital with another 60 
billion in reserves he said when the sampl industry got into 
trouble it had 10 billion 
l william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corp said on the nbc program that bank losses are expected to 
total 4 billion this year and possibly 5 billion next year

two leading education research centers announced 
sunday they have received grants to devise better ways to measure 
the thinking skills students will need to become successful adults 
the university of pittsburghs learning research and development 
center will receive 115 million from the pew charitable trusts of 
philadelphia 
for a related study the national center on education and the 
economy in rochester ny will get 13 million from the john d 
and catherine t macarthur foundation of chicago 
the pittsburgh group will deal primarily with technical aspects 
of the study while the rochester center will focus on broader 
policy questions betsy brown ruzzi senior associate of the 
rochester groups washington office said in a telephone interview 
the grants will fund the first 18 months of what could become a 
decadelong effort to replace the common multiple choice tests with 
a new testing method that measures how well students perform in 
reallife situations officials of both centers said 
growing numbers of educators and business leaders have 
complained that standardized tests give misleadingly positive 
signals about how wellprepared us youngsters are for the complex 
problems they will face as workers and citizens 
paul h oneill chief executive officer of alcoa and chairman 
of the presidents education policy advisory committee called the 
grants very good news 
improved assessment will help us to understand local national 
and internationl comparisons and point the way to necessary 
changes in our education process he said 
the first glimpse of the proposed assessments appeared in the 
rochester centers landmark report last june americas choice 
high skills or low wages which decried us students lack of 
preparation for the level of thinking and organization needed to 
thrive in the workplace 
according to the two research centers the proposed new testing 
methods would likely include 
performance examinations in which students would 
demonstrate their mastery of specific skills to panels of examiners 
much as an olympic figure skater tries to impress a panel of 
judges said ruzzi 
projects in which students show their ability to use 
problemsolving skills over time often in cooperation with other 
students 
portfolios consisting of the best work done by students 
in a variety of areas over time 
the goal of the new assessment system is not simply to create 
better exams the nation would be illserved if high standards were 
put in place but few students were able or motivated to reach 
them said marc tucker president of the rochesterbased center 
politicians and educators have been grappling for the past year 
to devise better ways to measure their progress toward an ambitious 
set of goals to improve education that was agreed upon last 
february by president bush and the nations 50 governors 
a 14member national education goals panel led by colorado gov 
roy romer is scheduled to hold its latest meeting in washington on 
wednesday 
romer in a statement accompanying sundays announcement 
applauded the pittsburghrochester project as a critical and 
muchneeded contribution to ongoing efforts to restructure 
schools 
the two research centers said they planned over the next three 
months to assemble a group of school districts and states that 
would help develop and test the assessment project 
the projects leaders said they hope that initial group will 
also form the foundation of a national system that could 
demonstrate whether the new brand of assessment is better than 
multiplechoice testing

government and business 
leaders praised the european communitys decision to ease sanctions 
on south africa but black opposition groups on sunday criticized 
the move 
the ec said on saturday it was lifting a voluntary ban on new 
investment in south africa it left intact embargoes on the imports 
of iron steel and gold coins and on arms exports 
it was the first major sanction to be lifted against south 
africa since western countries began imposing punitive measures in 
the mid1980s 
thabo mbeki head of the african national congress foreign 
affairs department said sunday his movement is not going to 
stand still on this matter 
mbeki said the anc would be in contact with the united states 
and others in a bid to keep present sanctions in place 
the ec in an announcement saturday at its summit in rome said 
it would further ease sanctions when south africa eliminates 
remaining apartheid laws that segregate citizens by race and keep 
the white minority in power 
foreign affairs minister pik botha hailed the ecs move calling 
it positive recognition for president fw de klerks courageous 
steps 
this also means that the state presidents initiatives have 
started a dramatic reversal in south africas foreign relations 
he said saturday this will be to the advantage of all the people 
of south africa 
anglo american south africas largest corporation that 
dominates the goldmining industry said in a statement saturday it 
expected the united states to take similar action next year 
the company called the ec move a major step toward normalizing 
relations between south africa and the international community 
the european decision came as the african national congress the 
largest black opposition group voted at a conference saturday to 
maintain its support for sanctions as a means of pressure on the 
government to eliminate apartheid 
other opposition groups also expressed bitterness 
the ec decision was to be expected because white people 
support other white people itumeleng mosala of the radical 
azanian peoples organization said saturday this will be a 
lesson to black liberationmovements to know that in the struggle 
they are on their own 
in lifting the ban on new investment the ec followed the lead 
of britain which announced earlier this year it would unilaterally 
end a ban on new investment to indicate support for de klerks 
reforms 
since britains move there has been no announcement of major 
british investment in south africa 
there was no way to effectively gauge the immediate impact of 
the ec action symbolically though it showed growing 
international acceptance that the demise of apartheid was 
inevitable and raised the prospect of other sanctions being lifted 
south africas economy potentially the strongest in southern 
africa has been in recession for a year due in part to the 
isolation caused by sanctions 
for example more than half the 300 us companies doing 
business in south africa have pulled out since sanctions took 
effect in 1986 many sold out to local managers but continue to 
hold licensing agreements in south africa 
if the united states also lifts a ban on new investment such 
companies could buy back their facilities and resume production 
but foreign investors have adopted a cautious attitude toward 
south africa because of chronic violence among black factions the 
changing political climate and the recession

the publisher of the strikebound daily news 
sunday called for the appointment of a federal mediator to force 
both sides toward a settlement 
what we are in favor of is a very highpowered supermediator 
to come in and knock everybodys heads together publisher 
james hoge said on a local television news program 
on the same show newspaper guild president barry lipton said 
were willing to consider anything that will bring about a fair 
and equitable settlement 
hoge and lipton both rejected binding arbitration 
both sides met separately in washington last week with the head 
of the federal mediation and conciliation service bernard delury 
no progress was made because the nine striking unions want to 
bargain as a group and the company wants to bargain with them 
individually 
both sides agreed to be recalled but delury said he would wait 
a few days before recalling them 
the news has published every day since the strike began oct 25 
but it has lost advertisers and about half of its circulation 
which was 109 million before the strike

hundreds of thousands of moldavians on sunday 
demanded independence from the kremlin demonstrating on the eve of 
a parliament session to consider president mikhail s gorbachevs 
new union treaty 
gorbachev will preside over the opening of the fourth session of 
the 2250member congress of peoples deputies which also will 
consider a proposal to strengthen gorbachevs control over the 
fragmenting union 
demonstrators on sunday packed the center of kishinev capital 
of the southwestern republic of moldavia in a selfdeclared 
grand national assembly they demanded the kremlin acknowledge 
moldavian sovereignty and called for changing moldavias name to 
the republic of moldavia dropping the words soviet 
socialist 
marchers carried banners that said down with the russian 
empire and long live greater romania 
moldavia formerly called bessarabia by romanians has strong 
ethnic ties to that neighboring country more than 65 percent of 
moldavias 43 million people speak a language identical to 
romanian except that it uses cyrillic characters 
romanian president ion iliescu has called for a unification of 
romania and bessarabia into a greater romania 
soviet television showed hundreds of thousands of people crowded 
into a central square for the rally organized by the nationalist 
moldavian popular front some reports put the crowd size at 
800000 but the figure could not be verified 
the republic like nearly all the other 15 republics has 
declared autonomy over central kremlin control several smaller 
ethnic groups and regions within republics have sided with the 
kremlin most fearing discrimination by the republics majority 
nationalities 
in estonia about 3000 demonstrators mostly ethnic russians 
rallied sunday in support of gorbachev and against the 
independenceminded estonian leadership according to the 
independent estonian news agency 
the 21monthold national parliament is expected to approve a 
draft of the union treaty the new charter proposed by gorbachev to 
redefine the relationship between the central government and the 
republics 
under the proposed treaty the national government would retain 
control over defense and national security as well as energy 
transportation and other key industries republics would gain some 
control over economic decisions and their participation 
theoretically would be voluntary 
gorbachev has said quick adoption of the treaty is necessary for 
staving off further deterioration of the national economy 
the baltic republics of latvia lithuania and estonia plus 
moldavia have refused to join the talks 
the congress also is expected to approve the streamlining of the 
executive branch of government that gorbachev proposed last month 
to break the paralysis of power that is hampering his reforms 
under his plan the council of ministers or cabinet headed by 
prime minister nikolai ryzhkov would be replaced by several bodies 
under direct presidential control 
the congress session likely will include tumultuous debate 
heightened by a newly assertive hardline wing and a larger but 
more disorganized liberal side 
the liberal interregional group of deputies has been unable to 
agree on a stance toward the union treaty while reformist moscow 
mayor gavriil popov urged in a newspaper interview sunday that the 
congress be dissolved and replaced by a new parliament that would 
elect a new president 
in recent weeks gorbachev has appeared to be trying to appease 
the hardliners he has replaced the moderate interior minister 
with a kgb general expected to crack down on political uprisings 
he has also ordered harsher kgb and army action 
kgb chairman vladimir kryuchkov last week pledged a crackdown on 
radicals who he said were trying to gain power by sabotaging food 
supplies during the nations economic crisis 
gorbachev also has ordered the kgb the army and interior 
ministry to stop workers in the state distribution system from 
stealing food and selling it on the black market such pilfering is 
one key factor contributing to the nations food crisis which has 
seen supplies of goods dwindle at state stores

thousands of romanians rallied sunday 
in timisoara where the countrys popular revolution was born in 
an emotional first anniversary celebration of the death of 
communism 
they also demanded the resignation of the current government 
which was democratically elected but is dominated by former 
communists 
about 15000 people gathered as snow fell in opera square the 
site of last years violent protests that led to the ouster and 
execution of communist dictator nicolae ceausescu 
twelve months of lies the demonstrators chanted some 
waving romanian tricolor flags with holes cut in the middle to 
resemble those of the revolution with the communist emblem excised 
in the capital bucharest several hundred antigovernment 
demonstrators occupied central university square in the early 
evening they shouted demands for the resignation of iliescu and 
the government and blocked traffic before being dispersed by about 
300 clubwielding police no arrests or injuries were reported 
in a national television address sunday night president ion 
iliescu appealed for calm and tried to quell opposition fears 
to negate the results of the elections only six months after 
they were held and impose something else in the name of a 
dissatisfied minority would only amplify our difficulties he 
said 
the postceausescu provisional government led by iliescus 
national salvation front capitalized on the elation following the 
revolution to overwhelmingly win democratic elections may 20 
since then however economic hardship and the growing suspicion 
that senior front officials who previously served ceausescu have 
not broken with communism has turned many people against the front 
unrest has grown over the last month in timisoara bucharest and 
elsewhere demonstrators have demanded the resignation of iliescu 
premier petre roman and other senior officials those demands were 
voiced again sunday 
but the rallies in both timisoara and bucharest were smaller 
than expected perhaps because of recent government pledges to 
postpone price hikes on food and other goods from january to june 
in timisoara opposition politicians student activists and 
labor leaders speaking from the balcony of the city opera house all 
said the government had betrayed the revolution 
down with iliescu down with the communist government they 
chanted iliescu at christmas youre the best pig to 
slaughter 
down with the securitate the crowd roared alluding to 
widespread perceptions that the government continues to tolerate 
ceausescus feared secret police hands soaked in blood 
passersby applauded several old men and women dressed in 
black and clutching pictures of sons and daughters killed by army 
and securitate bullets last year wept and crossed themselves as 
the marchers knelt and intoned prayers 
the last chance another revolution the crowd chanted 
earlier this month the government postponed price increases for 
basic foodstuffs and services from january to june the move 
appeared to take some of the fight out of bucharest workers and 
students who backed away from planned strikes aimed at bringing 
down the leadership 
but in timisoara a city of 283000 about 300 miles northwest of 
the capital antigovernment activism continued 
eleven local factories employing about 50000 people have been 
on strike since dec 9 student representatives said about 22000 
university students had been boycotting classes since dec 9 and 
would continue the boycott after the end of christmas break jan 
6 unless national leaders resign 
about 100000 students and hundreds of professors are striking 
nationwide 
timisoaras central role in the revolution accounts for some of 
its radicalism 
the uprising began last dec 16 outside the local yellowbrick 
church of laszlo toekes the ethnic hungarian pastor whose fervent 
criticism of ceausescu prompted an order by the dictator to 
forcibly resettle him 
police broke into the church beat toekes and took him away 
parishioners and others who had gathered outside marched to the 
communist party headquarters where they broke windows and set 
fires 
demonstrations spread across romania and there were vicious 
street battles between citizens and the heavily armed secret 
police the army sided with the citizens however and ceausescu 
fled bucharest on dec 22 he was captured a day later and executed 
on christmas day 
toekes now is a bishop of his reformed church of protestants and 
lives in oradea 40 miles northeast of timisoara he returned to 
his former church sunday to hold a commemorative service

a double standard encouraged by international 
agreements exists for foreign airlines operating in the united 
states endangering passengers crews and people on the ground a 
newspaper reported sunday 
the federal aviation administration never verifies the 
qualifications of pilots for foreign airlines and fails to inspect 
foreignowned airline equipment unless the other government 
requests it according to new york newsday 
in its fivemonth investigation newsday ran a computer analysis 
of some 700 accidents worldwide conducted scores of interviews 
and reviewed thousands of documents some obtained through the 
freedom of information act 
newsday said pilots for some foreign carriers dont get training 
in such basic elements as supervising crews and using devices that 
warn of collision with high terrain 
in the last 20 years almost 21000 people have been killed on 
foreign airlines those carriers make about half of all flights but 
account for 80 percent of the deaths worldwide newsday said 
this year the gap was even wider almost 500 people died on 
foreign planes while only 37 were killed on us carriers 
the statistics exclude accidents caused by sabotage or 
terrorism 
faa spokesman fred ferrar in washington said sunday he hadnt 
seen the story and didnt want to comment 
bill spohrer who runs challenge air cargo in miami told how 
regulators from central american countries inspected the airlines 
he used to run in nicaragua and honduras 
the inspector would come up and wed put him up at the hotel 
hed bring his wife or girlfriend and theyd go shopping on the 
last day before he had to leave hed come by and say ok what do 
i have to sign 
richard haberly president of a small miamibased cargo airline 
scuttled plans to lease a jet he needed when the faa said it would 
require 300000 in modifications to meet us safety standards 
a month later he saw it land in miami under the colors of a 
foreign carrier 
its just awful we allow them to come to the us with barely 
any regulation at all said robert lochner a former faa 
inspector who was supposed to oversee 60 foreign carriers by 
himself 
newsday said most carriers from wealthier nations had 
aboveaverage safety records but many from developing countries 
and eastern europe were among the most dangerous 
although the faa has authority to inspect foreign carriers 
under international practice the united states usually just 
accepts a foreign countrys word about crew qualifications and 
planes worthiness 
anthony broderick the faas associate administrator for 
regulation in washington dc told newsday that the faa doesnt 
examine foreign carriers closely because the current system works 
tragic accidents despite the best efforts of the best 
agencies in the world sometimes happen said broderick but 
there are very few international accidents in the united states or 
around the world these international agreements have proven the 
test of time and work well 
newsday said the national transportation safety board plans to 
rule early next year on the probable cause of the avianca crash 
last january on long island that killed 73 people 
the newspaper reported that the ntsb is expected to recommend 
that the faa beef up its rules for foreign carriers and crews 
because of problems uncovered in that accident

16month break recently public anxiety about arab attacks has 
risen and rightwing politicians have urged a harsh crackdown 
israel wants to show arabs linked to murders that it will 
cause immediate deportation of people he knows whom he works with 
and who incite him to violence arens said on army radio 
i believe that the deportation will not be the last and 
we will not hesitate to use this tool in the future in the ame 
instances where it will be effective arens said 
health minister ehud olmert indicated israel wants to expel more 
arabs but is sensitive to us criticism 
the yedioth ahronoth newspaper said arens wanted to deport 14 
palestinians but that prime minister yitzhak shamir approved only 
four 
the deportations were ordered saturday a day after three jews 
were stabbed to death in a factory in the tel aviv suburb of jaffa 
hamas or zeal an underground moslem fundamentalist group claimed 
responsibility 
hamas published a leaflet sunday praising the killings and 
calling for a week of escalated attacks on israelis israel radio 
and television reported 
the four ordered deported were from the gaza strip and were 
known hamas activists who helped organize acts of violence the 
army said about 600 arabs were arrested in a weekend sweep on hamas 
activists 
however israeli authorities have not said if the people they 
ordered out are suspected of involvement in the murders 
arab lawyers in gaza appealed the deportation orders to a 
military board sunday the appeal is expected to be considered 
monday israeli media said 
curfews confined about 320000 gaza residents to their homes 
and a naval blockade stopped fishermen from launching their boats 
sunday 
in tel aviv police reportedly rounded up some palestinian 
workers and bused them back to gaza after detaining them overnight 
police spokesman ron yishayahu said those without permits to stay 
in israel overnight were being sent home 
yishayahu did not say how many palestinians were being taken 
back to gaza about 110000 arabs from the occupied territories 
work in israel 
israel television said police also planned to bar arabs from the 
occupied west bank and gaza from entering jerusalem on monday 
authorities fear violence at the temple mount where jewish 
extremists have threatened to demonstrate for the hanukkah holiday 
at least 17 palestinians were killed by israeli police gunfire in 
october during arab riots at temple mount 
there was new criticism sunday of the deportation order 
the us state department denounced it as a violation of human 
rights protection provided by the geneva convention 
we hope the israeli government will come up with some other 
way of dealing with the problem us sen daniel k inouye 
dhawaii told reporters in jerusalem 
interior minister aryeh deri of israel was also critical 
they should have been put on trial and then deported deri 
of the ultraorthodox torah guardians party told the national itim 
news agency 
shimon peres leader of the leftofcenter labor party said 
i suggest we stop competing for who can climb higher on the 
ladder of violence and see how we can lower the escalation rather 
than raise it walls sticks and deportations wont solve the 
problem 
sixty arabs have been expelled since the palestinian uprising 
began in december 1987 the last to be deported were five 
palestinians in august 1989 
the palestine liberation organization on sunday denounced the 
deportation order as a violation of international law 
according to a statement received in nicosia cyprus

antigovernment feeling has reached unprecedented 
levels in communist albania and if authorities arent careful the 
country could go the romanian route a us scholar said sunday 
after spending two weeks there 
nicholas c pano a history professor at western illinois 
university and leading scholar of albania was one of only a 
handful of foreigners who were traveling in the country as it was 
shaken by violent rioting and political upheaval last week 
he described broad changes sweeping europes last stronghold of 
stalinism from the playing of bob dylan on state radio to the 
formation of opposition political parties 
but he also said that an economic crisis and disgust at official 
corruption and the countrys selfimposed isolation had driven 
albanians to the limit 
i myself was surprised by the strength of feeling the pentup 
anger and desire for change pano said sunday a day after flying 
from albania to italy 
a few wrong decisions by the government could see the whole 
thing go the romanian route 
romanias communist government was overthrown last year in a 
revolution and its dictator nicolae ceausescu was executed 
pano the author of a book on albania said numerous changes 
reflect the governments cautious reforms and citizens growing 
boldness in demanding their rights 
in the capital city of tirana for example workers at albanias 
film studio are discussing forming a political party he said 
television workers are calling for freedom from state control 
typographers at governmentcontrolled newspapers are talking 
about establishing the first independent trade union he said 
state media were unusually frank in reporting on rioting in at 
least four cities last week 
albanians are abuzz about the state radios recent decision to 
broadcast part of a bob dylan song pano said he didnt know which 
one 
he quoted albanians as saying that an orchestra in tirana played 
george gershwins rhapsody in blue a few weeks ago a real 
event in a country that long tried to ban most western influences 
the albanian communist leadership has this year embarked on a 
program of cautious reform including lifting restrictions of 
religious practice it had ruled out political pluralism however 
until last week when president ramiz alia said the communist 
leadership would allow the formation of alternative parties 
but pano who speaks albanian said students and bluecollar 
workers voiced deep suspicions about authorities promises of 
reform 
any attempt now by the government to turn back would have 
serious repercussions in the country pano said the regime 
could not survive 
the more radical demands of some students may force a split in 
the countrys first opposition party the democratic party he 
said among the new partys leaders are middleaged intellectuals 
such as tirana university professor gramoz pashko who have been 
treated well by the government 
there are some people who express concern about what they 
call coddled intellectuals said pano 
he attributed the governments ouster of five politburo members 
last week to widespread popular dissatisfaction over official 
incompetence and high living 
albanians are becoming more vocal in objecting to such behavior 
he said 
for example in the southern town of korce more than 500 people 
marched to the home of a communist party leader on dec 9 they 
demanded to know why he had three cars when they had insufficient 
bus service pano said citing local witnesses

the new spiritual leader of 
irish roman catholics on sunday demanded the irish republican army 
end its twodecade campaign of terror 
the rev cahal dalys harsh comments came at his installation as 
the new archbishop of armagh and primate of all ireland among 
officials in attendance were irish president mary robinson irish 
prime minister charles haughey and britains northern ireland 
secretary peter brooke 
the longer you continue with your campaign of violence the 
more ignominious in the end will be the memory you will leave 
behind you and the further away from attainment will be any of 
your aims and objectives he told the ira 
the predominantly catholic ira is fighting to end british rule 
in northern ireland 
daly 73 who leads the 38 million roman catholics in northern 
ireland and the irish republic said the iras goals could be 
attained through peaceful political progress 
you have no sane reason or justification moral rational or 
political for continuing with your campaign of violence he 
told the ira 
you have every reason moral rational and political for 
calling off your campaign now 
the ira which is waging a shooting and bombing campaign to 
unite the largely protestant province with the mainly catholic 
republic of ireland is opposed by a number of protestant 
paramilitary groups many of them illegal 
daly said there are people in both catholic and protestant 
communities whose consciences are blindfolded and prevented 
them seeing the enormity of their violent deeds 
the popular overthrow of communist governments in eastern europe 
last year was primarily a spiritual and moral revolution he said 
and it achieved by peaceful means what armed uprising never could 
daly the bishop of down and connor since 1982 succeeds 
cardinal tomas o fiaich who died in may of a heart attack aged 
66 while on pilgrimage to the shrine of lourdes france 
his successor was installed at armaghs st patricks cathedral 
and a number of leading protestant churchmen was also in 
attendance 
educated at queens university in belfast and the institut 
catholique in paris daly was ordained in 1941 
daly has become known for his outspokenness against the ira in 
october at the funeral of a catholic man mistaken by the ira for a 
protestant he called the ira the greatest affliction of our 
community over the past 20 years and said membership of the ira 
was most gravely sinful 
around 2800 people have died in 20 years of sectarian violence 
in northern ireland

the fatal shooting of a black florist by a white 
rookie policeman responding to a burglary call has prompted calls 
for an investigation and revived talk about racial tensions 
precipitated by dallas police 
community leaders urged a congressional or local independent 
probe into fridays slaying of rl gunny rose owner of 
veterans florist on dallas south side 
police said 25yearold officer vincent reetz mistakenly 
believed rose was an assailant 
some say roses death is too reminiscent of two other dallas 
police killings that ignited racial strife and prompted calls for 
massive department reforms 
in the cases of etta collins in 1986 and david horton in 1987 
each victim was black carrying a gun in selfdefense and killed by 
a white officer 
black leader roy williams said the fatal shooting supports his 
earlier request for an investigation of the dallas police 
department 
this is not just an africanamerican or latino problem 
williams told the fort worth startelegram in sundays editions 
this crosses all races and socioeconomic levels the system 
is broken and we must fix it but we must act now 
and city council member al lipscomb whos black said he wants 
an investigation into roses shooting and the departments deadly 
force policy 
but police and their supporters say the shooting is just another 
tragic mistake unjustly tinged with racial undertones 
this could have happened to anybody on the department said 
sgt mike black who coordinates field training for rookies 
police officials said reetz did not hear the 53yearold man 
identify himself as the flower shops owner 
it was dark out there and theres a fine line between doing 
the right thing and doing the wrong thing black said its all 
reaction 
its not like on tv when the music is climaxing and then you 
go to commercial there you have a couple of minutes to think 
about the situation and come up with a solution this is the real 
world and things dont happen that way 
roses store had been broken into twice in the last month when 
the alarm went off a third time at 130 am friday he arrived at 
the store before police 
he was shot in the chest when he turned revolver in hand when 
he heard reetz utter a command 
mr roses reaction to the command from a police officer was 
not unreasonable said deputy chief ray hawkins unfortunately 
when you turn you bring the weapon to bear thats the concern we 
have with people arming themselves 
joan smotzer cochairwoman of the unified coalition for police 
reforms noted that rose had identified himself to reetzs partner 
moments before the shooting 
if reetz were unaware of the exchange as he has told 
authorities then it points up the need for better training ms 
smotzer said 
the death of mrs collins 70 prompted a congressional hearing 
in april 1987 that focused on the history of strained relations 
between minorities and dallas police 
the next month david horton 81 was shot to death while 
investigating a car theft in the parking lot of his apartment 
building 
police chief billy prince who blamed city council critics for 
creating a negative atmosphere that led to violence against 
officers resigned under pressure the following year 
mack vines billed as a reformer took the helm in mid1988 and 
quickly promoted minority officers into top jobs 
in 1989 the civilian review board was given limited powers to 
investigate allegations of police wrongdoing 
vines himself was fired early this year for lying about a 
shooting inquiry

environmental protection agency officials 
say theyre stumped by the disappearance of pcbs from a hazardous 
waste site that once had high concentrations of the cancercausing 
substance 
polychlorinated biphenyls once used as insulators in electrical 
transformers were banned by the federal government in the 1970s 
they have not been known to break down in the environment and have 
been considered nearly impossible to destroy 
but officials say a lagoon at the former camor oil rerefinery 
site which once contained more than triple the concentration of 
pcbs allowed by law now appears free of the contaminants 
epa spokeswoman sue pastor said agency officials are studying 
the site to find out what happened 
the epa cited camor in january 1985 for pcbs in three of 11 
waste oil lagoons the company filed for bankruptcy two years 
later 
jack barnette an epa supervisor for emergency response helped 
oversee a containment and temporary cleanup project in which crews 
combined the three infested lagoons drained and treated the 
wastewater and added lime to help harden the waste 
the epa then covered the new lagoon with a tarp to prevent rain 
from washing contaminants out of it 
when epa officials returned to test the lagoon in mid1988 they 
found the oil sludge intact but the pcbs gone barnette said 
well water monitoring around the site shows the chemicals did 
not seep out of the lagoon he said officials say the pcbs appear 
to have disintegrated into harmless chemical components 
barnette said the leading theory is that high heat and low 
moisture during a long drought in 1988 combined to disintegrate the 
contaminants 
lime used to harden the sludge may have also helped break down 
the pcbs but so far there is no scientific evidence to prove it 
barnette said 
at a similar site in toledo ohio where the epa began a cleanup 
effort just after the one at camor lime was used to harden sludge 
and the pcbs also disappeared 
we are not sure if it was the environment or the lime or the 
combination but from now on well be using lime when we deal with 
pcbs he said

portauprince haiti ap frustration replaced fear among 
many haitians who overcame worries of election violence sunday 
but confronted long voting delays 
nothing would keep me from voting said 25yearold jean 
elie standing in line at a school to vote in the effort to hold 
haitis first fully democratic elections in history 
ballots and ballot boxes were late arriving at many polling 
stations at one no ballots had arrived by noon six hours after 
the official start of voting some election delegates said they 
also lacked pens ink and registration lists 
in general haitians shrugged off the possibility that a 1987 
election day massacre would be repeated that election was called 
off after thugs with machetes knives and guns killed at least 34 
voters 
many voters rode bicycles or walked for miles arriving before 
dawn and waiting for the polls to open 
in the cite soleil slum where thousands live in ramshackle huts 
and bathe in open sewers voters grew impatient and began waving 
their registration cards in the air after many polls failed to open 
on time 
hurry up please let us in a chorus of people standing 
outside a school pleaded with election officials 
when some voters began waving branches the traditional symbol 
of celebration or protest 50 riot police arrived to block any 
attempt to start a demonstration 
we have a lot of help but not enough said daniel bernier 
in charge of the elections in western haiti we dont have enough 
cars to deliver supplies 
his office was stacked with undelivered ballots and folded 
ballot boxes outside workers were rushing them onto a truck 
some who failed to register expressed regret 
i saw what happened last time i lost two cousins and my aunt 
was wounded here but now i feel sorry not to be voting said 
fleury margella 25 who tried to vote in 1987 at the argentine 
bellegrade secondary school where 14 were slain in the election 
massacre 
at the school only two of the 19 voting booths were open two 
hours after polls opened sunday 
some of the nearly 1000 international observers noted haitians 
interim government had been little time to prepare for elections 
announced in september 
there are going to be glitches all over said j michael 
levesque mayor of west warwick ri who is one of eight 
observers sent by president bush but when you see people 
standing in long lines in the hot sun its remarkable 
most of the poor in the capital of portauprince appeared to 
support the rev jeanbertrand aristide a leftist priest 
considered the frontrunner among a field of 11 presidential 
candidates many voiced suspicion that the delays were deliberate 
and intended to keep them from voting 
aristide was an ardent critic of the duvalier family 
dictatorship that ruled haiti for 29 years and holdovers from the 
regime had vowed to keep him out of the presidency 
in gonaives about 105 miles northwest of the capital peasant 
organizations said small rice and bean farmers backed aristide 
they said army officers met with city leaders to try to turn voters 
against aristide 
others in gonaives with ties to the duvaliers were not so 
enthusiastic about aristide 
there will be no titid diminutive for aristide for 
president its impossible youll see the country needs a 
moderate man said zacharie delva once a leader of the tonton 
macoutes the feared private militia used by the duvalier regime

annandaleonhudson ny ap there is sex galore in this 
magazine 
there is homosexuality and bisexuality and bestiality and 
miscegenation and just about every other permutation of sexual 
conduct known to men and women 
but dont contact the authorities the treatment these 
sensational topics receive in the gray pages of the journal of the 
history of sexuality is more likely to send the average reader to a 
thesaurus than a cold shower 
its scholars talking to other scholars about research and 
important scholarly studies using all of the methodology and 
approaches that are used in social science research said robert 
shirrell of the university of chicago press publisher of the 
journal its not going to be nor would it serve its function if 
it were a publication for a general audience 
articles in the first two issues covered such subjects as holy 
harlots a study of prostitute saints in medieval europe the 
homosexual habits of actors on the 18th century london stage and 
early writings and research on syphilis in 15th and 16th century 
england 
studies of old norse sexuality and marriage rituals in 
modernday morocco have been lined up for future issues 
the quarterly journal is edited by john fout 53 a professor of 
modern european history at bard college a small liberal arts 
school 100 miles north of new york city 
while researching sexual politics topics such as the forced 
sterilization policies of nazi germany fout said he discovered no 
journal on sex was devoted to the works of scholarauthors like 
himself 
studies in the field were dominated instead by sexologists 
researchers like masters and johnson doing medically based studies 
of sexual behavior or by pyschologists working on the mental 
aspects of sexuality fout said 
he said he decided to start a new journal that would publish 
the best and the newest and the most critical theoretical 
scholarship from scholars around the world 
the journal which debuted in july is the 51st scholarly 
publication produced by the university of chicago press 
fout said the works in his journal represent a largely new and 
unconventional way of looking at the sexual history of mankind 
most of the study of human sexuality during the past generation 
has centered on how the body works he said the studies in his 
journal examine instead the way sexual behavior has been molded by 
the influences within society and culture such as religion 
politics and government 
for instance an article in the second issue of the journal 
explores the condoms struggle for legal and social acceptance in 
20th century america author joshua gamson said his research only 
peripherally deals with sex and that it might have been 
difficult to get his piece published in a sciencebased sexual 
journal 
there arent many places where i could have placed an article 
on condoms said gamson 27 a doctoral student at the university 
of california berkeley 
the journal does not pay contributors scholars whose articles 
or book reviews are published are offered 10 free copies of the 
issue or a years free subscription an arrangement that fout said 
is standard for such publications 
so far the journal has about 1000 paid subscribers 
respectable for a firstyear publication shirrell said most 
copies can be found in college libraries fout said a few 
bookstores have agreed to sell the journal 
we undertake publications with the expectation that they will 
continue indefinitely shirrell said this is going to be an 
important area for academic research for a number of years

a commanding officer at the orlando naval 
training center has been cleared of accusations he was dating a 
lowerranking female sailor in violation of military policy 
a naval investigation found no evidence to support allegations 
that cmdr john fullerton was having an improper relationship with 
a thirdclass petty officer said rear adm louise wilmot 
commanding officer of the center 
wilmot spent six hours saturday interviewing fullerton the 
unidentified woman and eight other people before reaching her 
conclusion a base spokeswoman said 
navy rules prohibit officers from dating enlisted personnel and 
ban social contact between students and instructors the training 
center is under investigation by the pentagon for its handling of 
sexual assault cases and enforcement of rules concerning social 
relationships 
fullerton 41 was transferred to other duties at the naval and 
marine corps reserve center in orlando during the inquiry he will 
return to his post monday as second in command of the division that 
handles housing food recreation and other services 
lt cmdr nettie johnson a base spokeswoman said friday that 
an anonymous caller to the base legal department hotline accused 
fullerton of having a longterm relationship with the female 
sailor the caller also alleged that at a party on nov 24 he got 
into a hot tub with seminude women 
both fullerton who is married and the female petty officer 
denied any romantic involvement 
fullerton was at the party and acknowledged getting into the hot 
tub but witnesses said everyone was appropriately clothed 
fullerton was not immediately available for comment but 
according to johnson he said he and his wife were exhausted from 
the ordeal and they are glad its over 
a highlevel navy probe in july criticized the naval 
investigative service for the way it treated some women rape 
victims at the training center during questioning the nis is the 
navys investigative arm 
the report however noted the wilmot who once headed the 
navys equal opportunity office for women has improved the 
working climate and health benefits for female sailors since taking 
command of the base in may 1989 
last week a military judge ordered four male instructors to 
stand trial on charges that they dated or made sexual advances 
toward students or recruits 
a second team of pentagon investigators was scheduled monday to 
begin a survey of all female employees at the base to determine 
whether sexual harassment or improper relationships is an large 
problem there

soviets through the winter the official news agency said sunday 
the iraqi news agency quoted the chairman of the iraqi red

moscows main middle east ally and received much of its weaponry 
from the soviet union before its aug 2 invasion of kuwait since

donald trump got some help with a 
mortgage sunday by auctioning 35 luxury waterfront condominiums 
overlooking the ritz and fame of this highsociety resort 
the units in the twin 32story towers at trump plaza of the palm 
beaches sold for 8815 million 24 percent above the total asking 
price however the asking prices had been slashed by up to 
twothirds 
we far exceeded our expectations today this was a tremendous 
sale for trump plaza trump said i think it could work out to 
be a very good deal depending on what ultimately happens with the 
final numbers 
previous asking prices of 300960 to 18 million for the 
penthouse were trimmed to minimum bids of 150000 to 600000 
under pressure from marine midland bank the bank wanted trump to 
unload the units that had gone unsold since the developer took over 
the building in 1986 boasting the complex would be floridas 
hottest property 
developer ian kean of nearby singer island bought the penthouse 
for 720000 
the buildings biggest drawback local real estate experts say 
is location the property is on the wrong side of the intracoastal 
waterway in this prestigeconscious neighborhood 
the auction took place on the right side in a 
chandelierbedecked ballroom at the breakers a grand dame hotel on 
this barrier island trumps 118room maralago weekend retreat is 
also on the more prestigous side of the waterway 
about 85 of the 221 units remain vacant or unsold officials 
said trump made the decision not to auction all units and said no 
decision had been made on their disposal 
trump missed a 271 million payment oct 22 to marine midland 
which loaned him the money to buy the building in a restructuring 
agreement in august trumps lenders pushed him into the auction 
because sales had been so sluggish only one sale had been recorded 
this year 
as the auction catalog says glorious sundrenched days evolve 
into dazzling moonlit nights at the towers overlooking the 
waterway and this resort town 
the trump plaza has a sumptuous lobby with walls of marble and 
leather a concierge valet parking morning and afternoon pools 
sunning terraces a fitness center and tennis courts 
but the units are largely unfinished 
i think that was disappointing because that was not announced 
prior to our coming down here said bobbe jacobson of boston a 
professional party planner 
trump is also due to make 345 million in payments to 
bondholders who invested in two of his atlantic city casinos the 
formal deadline for the 184 million payment on the trump castle 
and a 161 million payment on the trump plaza hotel and casino was 
saturday but trump was given until monday to cover the bills 
because of the weekend 
if he fails to meet the deadlines monday he will be given a 
10day grace period to turn over the bond money on trump castle he 
would also have 30 days to make the payment on the trump plaza 
hotel and casino

president corazon aquino under 
public pressure to shore up the economy on sunday announced the 
resignation of her trade minister 
however she said calls for her to step down are figments of 
the imagination of her enemies 
in a nationwide television address mrs aquino said secretary 
jose concepcion handed in his resignation tuesday but would be 
retained until jan 2 to help the country through its economic 
crisis no replacement was named 
political sources speaking on condition of nonymity said 
other cabinet changes are expected 
mrs aquino acknowledged she was bowing to public pressure for 
changes in her administration after a stunning 45 percent increase 
in fuel prices coupled with a declining economy 
ive told him that what im doing is in response to grievances 
of some sectors in our society she said of concepcion it is 
truly difficult to be separated from familiar friends especially 
those who have proven their faith and conviction 
concepcion played no major role in the price increase but he 
had been under fire for allegedly failing to divest holdings in 
family businesses which prospered under the aquino administration 
mrs aquino noted that a senate panel cleared concepcion of 
wrongdoing she said nonetheless that she was accepting his 
resignation to help maintain national harmony 
concepcions resignation followed the replacement of mrs 
aquinos executive secretary catalino macaraig who had also 
served as the governments energy coordinator 
in her remarks sunday mrs aquino also acknowledged opposition 
calls for her to resign or call early elections four of the 23 
senators including three elected on the administration ticket 
have joined those calls 
the call for the resignation of the president has no meaning 
or significance but are figments of the imagination of people who 
thrive on illusions she said

miamis little haiti on sunday cheering for their favorite 
candidates and closely monitoring the first fully free presidential 
elections in their homeland 
the crowd overwhelmingly favored the rev jeanbertrand 
aristide a populist priest who has the admiration of many haitians 
here they said aristide represents a different class and 
background than haitis line of upperclass suppressive leaders 
and will bring real change 
today we need a president that we can put all our trust in 
so that haitians will have a better tomorrow said jacqui prime

korydallos prison saturday had been recaptured by late sunday 
the escapees were mostly burglars and thieves and did not 
include maximumsecurity prisoners including convicted murderers 
suspect terrorists and some of greeces most notorious felons

general inmates and as a holding facility for suspects awaiting 
trial korydallos located in the port city of piraeus near athens 
houses about 800 prisoners 
the spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
escape was the largest ever in greece

many marine reservists activated for duty in the 
persian gulf have never trained for desert warfare so the corps is 
bringing the desert to them 
reservists joining operation desert shield will get a taste of 
how to fight in the desert from a laser video being produced for a 
special simulator 
there are substantial differences as to the way things 
appear in the desert said maj lowell grubbs an assistant 
training officer at the 4th marine division in new orleans 
distances are hard to estimate its a flat terrain with little 
cover 
firearms training systems inc based in the atlanta suburb of 
norcross is producing the video for use with its simulator which 
36 marine reserve centers already use 
before iraq invaded kuwait in august the company had mainly 
provided video rifle ranges or green environments for marines to 
practice with the simulator shooting in jungles they likely would 
face in southeast asia or central america 
the desert video completed this month will go first to the 4th 
marine division said grubbs who participated in the filming 
it then will be distributed to other marine reserve centers by 
the beginning of next month it may go to saudi arabia for use by 
marines already stationed there said jeff marlin a spokesman for 
firearms training systems inc 
the marines simulators which cost 70000 apiece consist of a 
computer that projects a video onto a large screen speakers 
provide background noise squadrons of four soldiers at a time 
shoot at the screen with m16 rifles which are rigged to simulate 
gunshots 
it touches a lot of your senses grubbs said 
an instructor sits at the computer acting as commanding officer 
theres still a lot of human impact on this system its not 
a video game he said 
after the simulation the instructor rewinds the video and each 
soldiers shots represented on the film by numbered dots are 
reviewed 
grubbs said the simulators are more realistic than regular rifle 
ranges with popup cardboard targets 
people move differently than cardboard targets he said 
it takes different techniques to actually hit a moving person 
with this video soldiers will also practice firing while 
wearing gas masks in case they face chemical warfare in iraq 
marlin said the video also includes a shootdont shoot scenario 
in which the marines must decide if people rapidly appearing are a 
threat or innocent civilians adding they may have to go into 
kuwait city and will be faced with that situation 
he put the cost of the training at less than onetenth of a 
cent a round plus its right in the classroom

the pentagon is investigating whether 
honeywell plans for a sophisticated missile guidance system were 
sold to iraq through a swiss arms broker a newspaper reported 
sunday 
the star tribune said it was unknown whether the honeywell 
technology is in the hands of the iraqis who have been scavenging 
western defense technology for at least six years defense experts 
said 
were looking into everything and anything honeywell may have 
done transferring technology to iraq defense department 
spokesman rick oborn said last week 
the guidance system could give any missile deadly precision and 
weapons experts said the possibility of iraq possessing that 
technology could be more worrisome than its purchase of a study for 
a bomb called a fuelair explosive 
it was reported two weeks ago that iraq obtained the 300page 
technical study made by the minneapolisbased defense contractor in 
1984 for 100000 in a deal with ifat a swiss arms broker 
pentagon sources told the star tribune last week that they are 
investigating honeywell to determine whether one of its executives 
sold plans for a ring laser gyroscope to ifat in 1984 
the device which employs lasers and mirrors can be used to 
guide aircraft as well as missiles it is considered the heart of 
honeywell guidance systems 
weapons experts speculate that the iraqis would employ the 
technology with missiles loaded with either chemical weapons or 
explosives such as the fuelair explosive 
iraq also has been working on a nuclear bomb intelligence 
sources say 
honeywell acknowledged that investigators from the defense 
technology security administration met with company officials 
tuesday to discuss the bomb study and other possible sales to ifat 
pentagon officials asked the company to look for documents that 
would indicate whether plans for the ring laser gyroscope were sold 
to ifat 
we have not been able to find any information to support that 
inertial guidance technology was transferred to ifat honeywell 
spokeswoman susan eich said friday

the observer said their belief was based on what they had seen 
of voting results but he provided no numbers he spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
jeanrobert sabalat president of the independent electoral 
council declared the voters participated in the electoral 
process with an exemplary calm which one of our visitors called 
the haitian miracle 
this time the army was equal to its task he said 
he thanked international observers for their help and said we 
have just lived together a great day in our history 
supporters of the aristide who had been considered a 
frontrunner took to the streets sunday night in at least one area 
of downtown portauprince to celebrate what they regarded as his 
sure victory as president 
about 200 people many chanting aristides name and dancing in 
the streets took part in the early victory celebration the 
celebration appeared confined to that area however 
no violent incidents were reported through the day but there 
appeared to be some major delays some polling stations were kept 
open after the 6 pm closing time 
police and soldiers with automatic weapons guarded many polling 
places portauprince the capital seeking to avoid a repeat of an 
election day massacre three years ago in which at least 34 people 
were killed 
the international airport remained open but airlines canceled 
scheduled arriving flights in case of disturbances 
ismael diallo a spokesman for a un observer team said sunday 
night that voting apparently was peaceful throughout the country 
and there appeared to have been a large turnout 
the armed forces and the security forces have been very 
professional diallo said given haitis violent history he 
said its really very very positive 
however he said long delays occurred in many areas because of 
difficulty in distributing voting materials 
police in riot gear were deployed in the sprawling slum of cite 
soleil after polling stations in the area opened several hours 
late 
about 50 police blocked a highway to stop what appeared to be 
the start of a march downtown by hundreds of angry residents many 
waving cut branches a traditional symbol of protest or 
celebration however there were no clashes 
the seaside slum is a stronghold of support for aristide and 
many residents blamed his opponents for the delay in distributing 
ballots and ballot boxes 
five hours after polls were to open voting had begun in only 
one of 50 polling stations in the area 
it is either lack of preparation by the electoral council or 
sabotage said shiller marcellin president of a large labor 
federation 
election officials however attributed the delays to logistical 
problems 
weve had a lot of international help but not enough 
said daniel bernier the district election bureau director whose 
office was cluttered with undelivered ballots and ballot boxes 
he said he did not have enough trucks distribute voting 
materials 
no results from the nations 14500 polling stations were 
expected before noon monday because of poor communications the 
electoral council said 
nearly 3 million people or 85 percent of the electorate were 
registered to vote 
the election was monitored by about 800 international observers 
including former president jimmy carter 
carter arrived early at the argentine bellegrade secondary 
school where thugs protected by the army shot and hacked to death 
14 voters on nov 29 1987 at least 20 others were gunned down in 
the streets giving the military regime of that time a pretext for 
calling off the election 
subsequent elections in january 1988 were controlled by the army 
and boycotted by most of the main contenders in 1987 
we wanted to come here as a symbolic thing to show the people 
of haiti that its safe to vote today said carter who was 
accompanied by his wife rosalynn and daughter amy 
several voters waiting to cast ballots in the ramshackle school 
building and openair classrooms said they were not afraid 
no i came with all my heart said sander destine 27 when 
asked if he feared violence im happy to have elections im 
happy to have a leader he said referring to aristide 
aristide 37 a leftist roman catholic priest with a huge 
following among the majority poor was widely regarded as the most 
popular of 11 presidential candidates expectations of an aristide 
victory were running so high that some feared disturbances if he 
failed to win 
if no candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote a runoff 
is to be held on jan 20 
the new government will replace the caretaker administration of 
president ertha pascaltrouillot a supreme court justice appointed 
in march to lead haiti to democratic elections 
aristide dressed all in white cast his ballot at the capitals 
claire heureuse secondary school he was mobbed by supporters some 
jubilantly mimicking the crow of a rooster his campaign symbol 
marc bazin 58 a former world bank official seen as aristides 
closest rival and a favorite of the business community was voting 
in petionville a suburb where a grenadeandgun attack on dec 5 
left seven dead and more than 50 wounded at an aristide campaign 
rally 
despite fears that supporters of the 29year duvalier 
dictatorship would disrupt the election the dec 5 attack was the 
only electionrelated violence during the campaign which began in 
october 
the president is to be inaugurated on feb 7 1991 the fifth 
anniversary of the fall of jeanclaude baby doc duvalier whose 
father francois papa doc died in 1971 
haitians also were electing 110 members of a bicameral national 
assembly 134 mayors 268 municipal council members and 1695 
county officials 
the impoverished nation of 6 million people has been ruled 
almost exclusively by dictators since gaining independence from 
france in 1804 after a slave revolt 
since the younger duvalier fled into exile in france after a 
popular uprising the country has been ruled by five different 
governments 
the international observers also included representatives from 
the united nations and the organization of american states it was 
the first time the united nations had granted a request by a member 
nation to oversee its election
