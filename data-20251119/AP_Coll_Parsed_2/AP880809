droughtweary farmers who are pinning 
their hopes on soybeans now face another threat tiny hungry mites 
that like dry weather and can go unnoticed while destroying crops 
state agriculture officials say spider mites are invading 
soybean fields in michigan and other droughtplagued midwest states 
its a difficult critter to fight because theyre hard to see 
with the naked eye said doug landis a field crops entomologist 
at michigan state university 
when a crop looks bad its blamed on other things mostly 
the drought its not until the problem becomes severe that the 
mites are discovered landis said monday 
the mites which thrive in dry hot conditions feed on the 
underside of plant leaves by piercing plant cells and extracting 
the sap landis said after a few days the leaves bear yellow 
speckles and eventually turn brown or bronze 
entire fields can be completely lost if spider mites are not 
controlled and weather conditions allow them to build up 
populations landis said the eightlegged pests are easily 
carried on the wind from field to field 
its just another thing youve got to fight said farmer 
larry bennett of fulton who recently discovered mites in his 
soybean field 
the infestation is potentially another serious blow to farmers 
who have lost much of their corn crop in the drought and were 
hoping to cut their losses with soybeans which are bringing in 
higher prices 
because farmers in ohio indiana iowa illinois and minnesota 
also are combating the mites there has been a shortage of 
pesticides to kill the pests landis said 
we are running at capacity in an attempt to meet the 
steppedup demand dow chemical co spokesman sam barrick said of 
the production of one such pesticide lorsban 4 e the demand has 
been so great for the product were just running out of product

tropical storm beryl was downgraded to a 
tropical depression tuesday after moving inland and weakening 
leaving one person missing in the gulf of mexico but raising hopes 
that its remnants could bring rain to droughtstricken midwest 
farmers 
the coast guard rescued six people who endured two days of wind 
and rain on an island after high seas prevented them from returning 
to the mainland 
there was virtually no damage in southern louisiana except for 
some spot flooding and tree limbs blown down scattered damage was 
reported in southern mississippi including downed tree limbs and 
scattered power outages 
in new orleans where preparations continued for next weeks 
republican national convention few problems developed from the 
storm 
the beneficial aspects of this tropical storm are probably 
much greater than any negative effects from this system and 
thats rain said bob sheets director of the national hurricane 
center in coral gables fla 
shortly before 5 pm cdt forecasters downgraded the storm to a 
tropical depression as its highest sustained wind speed dropped to 
35 mph a storm is designated a tropical storm when wind speed hits 
39 mph 
the storms center was just westsouthwest of baton rouge by 
930 pm and was expected to continue moving slowly northwest 
the national weather service said 
seas of 7 to 10 feet were expected to drop behind the storm 
forecasters said although the storm was not producing widespread 
rain there was a danger of flooding from locally heavy storms the 
weather service said 
flooding was reported in mississippi in low areas and along 
overflowing rivers and streams about 150 people in harrison county 
were forced to move to higher ground tuesday because of river 
flooding said linda rouse deputy director for harrison county 
civil defense we have people on all of the rivers monitoring 
the levels 
beryl the atlantic storm seasons second named tropical storm 
still had the potential of moving back over the gulf where it 
would gain strength from the warm water but forecasters said that 
was unlikely 
we think its going to go on a more west track west 
northwest then turn toward the northwest up over the midwest 
area sheets said we dont think its going to go back out 
over the water so theres not much chance of it ever strengthening 
again 
thousands of workers from the marshes and offshore oil rigs were 
evacuated monday as a precaution and tourists abandoned the 
mississippi and alabama coasts 
the coast guard suspended a search tuesday for a 15yearold boy 
who fell overboard when a 24foot fishing boat capsized near 
dauphin island off the coast of alabama 
the youth whose name was not given was reported missing 
tuesday by a survivor found clinging to the hull of a vessel that 
capsized monday in the mississippi sound searchers believe the 
boat was swamped by sevenfoot waves 
although beryl barely bruised alabamas coastline 116 inches 
of rain was reported at dauphin island for the 24hour period 
ending at 7 am tuesday 
the coast guard rescued six people who went camping sunday on 
petit bois island south of pasagoula miss when the forecast was 
for mostly sunny weather that night the weather turned bad and 
the water became too choppy to travel back to the mainland 
we lost one of the tents mrs randy gibson said we 
patched the other with garbage bags and anything else we could 
find we exhausted everything we had 
we havent slept since sunday she said after being rescued 
tuesday we havent been dry since then 
homes were evacuated east of new orleans in the st bernard 
parish fishing villages of hopedale yscloskey and shell beach 
in lafourche parish authorities readied eight evacuation 
centers monday but seven of the centers remained closed tuesday 
the eighth was unoccupied and parish officials said they expected 
few problems with the storm

a new countdown begins tonight for a 
22second firing of space shuttle discoverys three main engines a 
vital test that has been postponed five times because of 
malfunctions 
if this test succeeds nasa officials will set a date for the 
first american manned space flight since the challenger burst into 
flames on liftoff in january 1986 the discovery launch date 
already officially moved four times is not likely to be before 
october because of all the test delays 
the flight readiness firing as its called is an overall 
workout of the main engines computer software ground support 
equipment communications lines and the launch teams 
the call to stations that begins the countdown was scheduled 
for 610 pm with the test set for 730 am wednesday without 
further problems fueling of the shuttles huge tank begins a half 
hour before midnight 
the shuttles no 2 engine is fitted with a new hydrogen bleed 
valve and sensor to replace units that caused a scheduled test to 
be scrapped last thursday in the split second before the start of 
ignition 
the recovery from the problem on thursday shows that the team 
is working smoothly and i am expecting an ontime engine firing on 
wednesday morning said hugh harris a spokesman for nasas 
kennedy space center 
discoverys three engines will be fired with slightly different 
start and stop times using only a portion of the half million 
gallons of fuel in the external tank 
bolts 3 feet long and 3 inches in diameter hold the shuttle to 
the pad while the engines generate 11 million pounds of thrust 
the two solid fuel rocket boosters flanking the shuttle tank 
will not be ignited but will be subjected to the same bending 
movements that led to a leak in one of the joints during 
challengers liftoff that leak allowed flame to escape and led to 
the shuttles destruction and the deaths of seven astronauts 
flight readiness firings have been required in the past for new 
shuttles only except for one time when a malfunction made a retest 
necessary but the national aeronautics and space administration is 
treating discovery as an untried ship because of the long time 
since the last flight and the many changes since the challenger 
disaster 
last thursdays engine test was aborted in the last second when 
a sensor reported that a valve had not closed as it was supposed 
to engineers determined that the sensor not the valve was 
malfunctioning but decided to replace both parts 
the designer of the shuttle rocket booster meanwhile announced 
monday that the last of five fullscale testfirings for the 
booster will be held aug 18 
the fifth in the series of firings of the 126footlong 
redesigned rocket will be conducted at morton thiokol incs 
northern utah plant

the columbia river rolls 
lazily through the desert of central washington nourishing crops 
and wildlife in what otherwise would be a wasteland of sagebrush 
and barren hills 
the river which once roared through deep gorges was 
immortalized in woody guthries depressionera song roll on 
columbia 
green douglas fir where the waters cut through 
down her wild mountains and canyons she flew 
canadian northwest to the ocean so blue 
its roll on columbia roll on 
but after the construction of more than a dozen dams in 51 
years the columbia has rolled nearly to a standstill for much of 
its 1214 miles the river is a series of dams and slackwater 
reservoirs providing electricity irrigation and flood control for 
washington oregon and canada 
the united states claims one last freeflowing stretch the 
55mile hanford reach and it too is facing major development 
the us army corps of engineers is proposing a 180 million 
project to open the river to barge traffic all the way to 
wenatchee so that logs wheat and apples from the states interior 
can be floated to pacific ocean ports 
the plan calls for dredging part of the river and building giant 
lifts over three dams to allow navigation between richland and 
wenatchee 
opponents say the dredging would forever ruin valuable fish and 
wildlife habitat archaeological sites and the last vestige of 
natural river flow 
washingtons congressional delegation has introduced legislation 
to protect the area 
the reach is one of the only areas where spawning habitats 
remain undisturbed nesting areas abound and majestic cliffs 
lining the river are mirrored in its quiet deep calm said sen 
dan evans rwash 
were telling them dont go ahead with these illconceived 
plans until we know the impact on spawning and recreation the most 
important use of the river said republican rep sid morrison 
whose district includes the area 
under the bill the department of the interior would protect the 
hanford reach for eight years until a study determines whether to 
permanently preserve the stretch under the wild and scenic rivers 
act 
the bill has already cleared the senate but morrison has delayed 
house action while negotiations continue to address concerns of the 
us department of energy 
that agency operates the hanford nuclear reservation a 
sprawling plutoniumproduction site that straddles the river the 
energy department is worried the study could hamper hanford 
operations said terry seeley a legislative aide to morrison 
there lies the irony of the wild and scenic designation as 
the columbia flows past nine federal nuclear reactors no one would 
call the view pastoral 
the huge eerie reactors technological marvels in their time 
produced much of the plutonium for the nations nuclear weapons 
arsenal the slowmoving river creeps past the hulking reactors 
with pumping stations razorwire fences and guard towers casting 
shadows over the water 
eight are closed permanently the newest the n reactor which 
was placed on cold standby earlier this year because the 
federal government no longer needed the plutonium stands closest 
to the river a brooding presence amid the jumping fish herons and 
deer 
much of the shore is offlimits to recreational users because 
the federal government wanted a buffer zone around its reactors 
the hanford reach runs from priest rapids dam south of mattawa 
to the reservoir of mcnary dam just north of richland 
the biggest objections to the dredging are that the movement of 
a halfmillion cubic yards of dirt would destroy some of the last 
wild runs of chinook salmon which battle their way up river to 
spawn 
thats one of the few or perhaps the only remaining natural 
spawning area in that entire river system below grand coulee dam 
that salmon and steelhead can get too said jerry neal deputy 
director the state department of wildlife 
the army corps of engineers has proposed building an artificial 
salmon spawning channel to compensate for areas lost to dredging 
but opponents say that would not work 
artificial spawning channels just dont provide the quantity 
and quality of reproduction that the natural freeflowing river 
provides neal said the technology hasnt been that 
wellperfected 
the dredging proposal has also run into stiff fiscal opposition 
the costbenefit ratio for the project currently stands at just 
80 cents in benefits for every dollar spent said george sellar 
manager of water resources for the port of chelan county in 
wenatchee which has been pushing the plan since the 1950s 
the port and the army are now studying the plan to try to make 
it economically stronger 
for instance some people feel that large quantities of apples 
could not be moved by barge because of the length of the trip but 
others say using refrigerated containers would keep them fresh 
sellar said 
the port hopes to save up to 40 percent in transportation costs 
compared to rail or trucking one barge will move the equivalent 
of 50 to 60 trucks sellar said

a distaste for turning lambs into chops 
has transformed a sewage treatment plant into a haven for sheep 
chickens geese rabbits and as their keeper puts it whatever 
people throw over the fence 
the creatures live on the 107acre spread of the upper 
blackstone water pollution abatement district amid tanks pipes 
pools pumps an incinerator and plenty of grass for grazing 
emil holland plant director recalls that in the spring of 1978 
a farmer was allowed to leave two lambs there to fatten up on the 
plants grassy field 
by the time the farmer returned in the fall plant employees had 
grown attached to the lambs and pleaded that they be spared their 
fate as shish kebab so the sewage district board voted to buy the 
sheep from the farmer soon more creatures arrived unannounced 
apparently abandoned by their owners 
wed come in the morning and one day we had 12 geese 
holland said monday the next day we had 12 ducks then four 
chickens 
on monday the community as holland describes it included 
three sheep two dozen geese two dozen chickens and roosters 
we get a lot of roosters and uncounted rabbits and pigeons 
the animals drink from a fountain that carries clean water they 
also have the run of two huts and staff at the sewage plant feed 
them grain 
motorists stop every day to look holland said and some leave 
with a pet we give them away to anybody who asks holland 
said as long as theyre not going to eat them

iran and iraq say they will accept a ceasefire 
the un peace plan appears to be under way and there is hope the 
8yearold war in the persian gulf will end soon here is a report 
on the human and material cost 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
for eight years iran and iraq sent their 
youth to slaughter squandered their wealth and mortaged their 
futures in a war that gained nothing for either side 
children as young as 13 eagerly seeking a martyrs death 
perished as sacrificial mine sweepers children parents and 
grandparents were blown to bits or crippled by bombs shells and 
missiles in the cities of both sides soldiers and civilians were 
maimed by poison warfare 
in all more than 1 million people were killed or wounded the 
war cost hundreds of billions of dollars and caused measureless 
agony and grief 
javier perez de cuellar the un secretarygeneral announced 
monday in new york that the two enemies had agreed to end the war 
with a ceasefire aug 20 and to begin peace negotiations aug 25 
in geneva 
on the killing fields near the southern port of basra iraqi 
soldiers dug trenches and unreeled barbed wire for setpiece 
battles reminiscent of world war i men and boys died by the 
thousands in the mud and shallow water of the marshes 
iraqs official news media periodically reported a harvest of 
the rotten heads foreign correspondents taken on guided tours 
were shown heaps of iranian bodies on the battlefield 
iran spoke of victories by its martyrdomseeking soldiers 
and revolutionary guards the ranks were swollen by children 
wearing martyr tshirts pressed into the service of ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeinis fundamentalist islamic government 
sometimes it seemed the young men of iraq commuted to battle so 
close was the front to many cities they returned in coffins atop 
automobiles moving in long processions 
iranians buried their dead in the martyrs cemetery outside 
tehran a huge graveyard whose centerpiece is a fountain of 
blood spewing water dyed red 
by western estimates the setpiece battles east of basra in 
january 1987 killed 25000 iranians and 10000 iraqis 
all the casualty figures are estimates neither country provided 
comprehensive numbers during the war which began in september 1980 
with border skirmishes followed by an iraqi invasion across the 
shatt alarab the waterway that forms the southern border 
anthony cordesman says in his book the iraniraq war and 
western security that at least 300000 iranians were killed and 
600000 wounded through 1987 with corresponding for iraq of 
120000 and 300000 
he says the estimates are conservative that by some accounts 
the dead total 1 million and the wounded 17 million 
by comparison 29 million people were killed in the korean war 
and 24 million in vietnam 
hundreds of billions of dollars were devoured by arms purchases 
lost revenues damaged or destroyed buildings and industrial plants 
war damage extended beyond iran and iraq lloyds the london 
insurance exchange reported 90 ships sunk or destroyed in the 
persian gulf and 546 attacked with at least 300 sailors killed and 
300 injured 
ninetythree ships were trapped in iraqi waterways throughout 
the war many of them written off lloyds said its underwriters 
paid more than 1 billion in ship claims and other insurers a like 
amount 
iraq started the war with foreign exchange reserves of 35 
billion and now owes an estimated 60 billion iran has not 
borrowed but its foreign exchange reserves have declined to a few 
billion dollars 
la tribune an financial journal published in paris estimates 
iran needs 80 billion and iraq 30 billion to rebuild 
transportation oil installations housing factories schools and 
hospitals 
evidence of the human cost is everywhere 
every family has been touched by the war an accountant 
named abdullah told an associated press correspondent in baghdad 
earlier this month 
theyve all had a son or a brother killed or maimed or taken 
prisoner he said every family has one or more men in the 
army two of abdullahs sons were in the army and a third was at 
home minus a hand and a leg 
battle casualties include many children under 15 who ran into 
mine fields with plastic keys to paradise around their necks 
french photographer francois lochon visited the front in 1984 
and reported seeing the bodies of many dead children who were no 
older than 12 or 14 
the skull shaved wrapped in the red scarf of the martyrs the 
key to paradise around the neck they were scattered around the 
rocky trenches or floating in the still waters he said 
many other warriors shown on iranian television appeared 
elderly with white hair and grins that showed few teeth in iraq 
president saddam hussein encouraged older citizens to join the 
popular army militia 
thousands of civilians were killed by bombs and 
surfacetosurface missiles that struck hospitals schools and 
residential areas in tehran baghdad and other cities 
hundreds of missiles were fired in a round of the war of the 
cities earlier this year 
iran reported 1145 civilians killed and 4000 wounded iraq did 
not give casualty figures but nearly 30 children were killed when 
an iranian missile hit a baghdad school last year 
iraqi battlefield casualties have been only about onequarter of 
irans but iraq has only 16 million people compared to 45 million 
in iran and was conscious from the beginning of the need to avoid 
heavy losses 
it resorted to chemical weapons which are banned by the 1925 
geneva convention un reports say one of those weapons was 
mustard gas the scourge of the world war i trenches 
iran claimed 5000 kurds were killed and 5000 wounded in a 
chemical attack on the border town of halabja in march foreign 
reporters taken there saw many bodies unmarked by wounds 
mohammed azizi a 25yearold student was in halabja at the 
time and said streets were strewn with the bodies of victims 
doctors said they suspected mustard gas killed them 
any door you opened there were children men and women 
dying dead azizi said

the iraniraq war cost hundreds of 
billions of dollars in lost revenues damaged and destroyed 
buildings industrial plants ships and military equipment 
aside from the human toll the economic cost to the combatants 
according to israeli experts who followed the war closely was more 
than 200 billion through 1986 nineteen months of further 
devastation added to this figure 
other countries have lost as well the london insurance firm 
lloyds reports that in the persian gulf tanker war 90 ships 
were sunk or destroyed and and 546 ships attacked most of them 
damaged 
another 93 ships have been trapped in iraqi waterways since the 
war began many of them written off 
insurance losses paid out by lloyds on ship hulls has been more 
than 1 billion other firms paid a similar amount lloyds said 
iraq started the war with foreign exchange reserves of 35 
billion and now owes foreign countries an estimated 60 billion 
iran has avoided borrowing but has run down its foreign exchange 
reserves to a few billion dollars 
iran and iraq refused to give figures on losses human material 
or economic 
the paris economic paper la tribune quoting western economic 
experts says iran needs 80 billion to rebuild transport 
facilities oil installations housing factories schools and 
hospitals it said iraq needs 30 billion for the same task 
a report by kiyotaki tsuji of the japanese institute of middle 
east economic studies estimated that damage to oil installations 
alone from bombing and shelling raids amounted to 28 billion for 
iran and 8 billion for iraq 
estimates of military equipment purchases for the war above 
normal prewar expenditures vary from 25 billion to 40 billion 
for iran and from 35 billion to 70 billion for iraq paying 
feeding and treating wounded soldiers added billions more to war 
expenditures 
losses in oil revenues estimated by tsuji are 23 billion for 
iran and 65 billion for iraq prewar production in iraq was 36 
million barrels a day it fell to 12 million barrels a day in 1981 
and gradually has been built back to 27 million barrels a day 
iraqi bombing raids decimated irans refining capacity from 13 
million barrels a day prewar to 400000 barrels a day forcing 
the iranians to import petroleum products costing 15 million a 
year oil experts here estimated 
iraqi raids damaged or put out of action iranian refineries at 
abadan isfahan shiraz tehran and bakhtaran the billiondollar 
oil loading facility at kharg island is virtually destroyed 
iranians wrecked iraqs oil shipping terminal at faw 
construction in iran has stopped because of iraqi bombing at a 
major petrochemical plant being built with japanese help at bandar 
khomeini at the huge gas collection and treatment plant being 
built by south koreans at nar kangan and at a nuclear power plant 
at bushehr 
early in the war iraq lost its 140000 barreladay oil refinery 
at basra basra port was closed and twothirds of the 1 million 
inhabitants of the city fled shelling attacks from iran which 
damaged most of the buildings 
missiles and bombs did extensive damage to civilian facilities 
in other major cities on both sides including tehran and baghdad

in the two years since she married the queens 
second son andrew the duchess of york has brought both sparkle and 
new controversy to the royal scene 
some critics find her vivacious personality and sense of fun 
tiresome or vulgar her adventurous spirit verging on the reckless 
but royal watchers say the 28yearold former sarah ferguson is 
a favorite with queen elizabeth ii 
prince andrew a tall handsome royal navy lieutenant gained a 
playboy reputation during a colorful bachelorhood it included a 
wellpublicized romance with an american actress koo stark who 
once appeared in softporn movies 
but by the spring of 1986 andrew was clearly smitten with the 
redhaired miss ferguson the public were enjoying her lively good 
nature and the queen was reported to be greatly relieved that 
andrew had found a suitable wife 
they married at westminster abbey july 23 1986 and became the 
duke and duchess of york both were 26 
sarah ferguson was a new kind of royal bride 
a sales executive with a graphic arts publishing company when 
she married she had led a free and independent life that included 
a threeyear romance with motorracing figure paddy mcnally a 
widower with two sons 
robust athletic and outspoken sarah was far from the slim 
demure and impeccablygroomed english rose that princess diana 
wife of prince charles typified 
she kept working after her marriage and although she had given 
up her publishing job by early 1988 she planned to do freelance 
work 
while andrew pursued his career as a royal navy pilot his wife 
learned to fly a helicopter and a plane so she could share the 
experience with him 
the yorks have rejected the traditional choice of an old stately 
home and are building a new house near windsor castle in a 
neotudor style that has drawn some criticism 
sarahs attempts to find a fashion sense of her own led to some 
howling failures each of which was dissected in the press 
the media also criticized what they saw as the duchess brash 
and vulgar behavior during the couples march us tour

dinner craig brown of the sunday times wrote while the stars of 
hollywood dressed in discreet black and stayed in the shadows down 
the stairs walloped someone who looked as if shed just won third 
prize for her carmen miranda impersonation at some forgotten 
resort 
has the duchess of york gone too far asked the observer 
newspaper 
as sarah grew heavily pregnant the tabloids carried 
unflattering photos of her and made remarks about her weight 
but the duchesss sense of humor scarcely flagged except in 
may when a newspaper carried a photo of her father maj ronald 
ferguson emerging from a london massage parlor 
while some newspapers called him romeo ronnie and suggested he 
be fired from his job as polo manager to prince charles the heir 
to the throne and others said the duchess was advised to avoid him 
in public sarah was photographed speaking to her father worriedly 
the major had become a close friend of the queens husband

insider trading on stolen business week stock 
tip columns has alarmed the magazines rivals compelling some to 
review their own security and recheck back issues to make sure they 
havent been victimized too 
we dont take any pleasure in what happened to business week 
but were in the enviable position of bolting the barn door before 
the horse escapes or at least checking the locks said gary 
belis spokesman for fortune which has a biweekly circulation of 
755000 were checking the locks 
belis said a spot check of fortunes companies to watch 
column going back several months showed no unusual prepublication 
activity in any stocks mentioned 
senior editorial officials at forbes and money two other widely 
read business magazines also said they were reassessing protection 
of marketsensitive material in the aftermath of the scandal at 
business week 
in addition the printing companies used by all four magazines 
said they were scrutinizing security and reminding all employees 
that unpublished material is sacrosanct and not to leave the plant 
the scandal surfaced july 21 when business week the nations 
largest business weekly with a circulation of nearly 1 million 
disclosed evidence of possibly illegal trading on stocks featured 
in its inside wall street column before it was available to the 
public 
a major investigation has since revealed workers in two plants 
run by business week printer rr donnelley amp co took copies the 
day before they were released to the public and peddled them to 
brokers sometimes for as little as 20 each 
as of the weekend four donnelley printers and three stock 
brokers one each from merrill lynch amp co prudentialbache 
securities co and advest inc had lost their jobs trades in 
several more brokerages are under investigation for possible links 
to prepublished inside wall street tips 
unlike newspapers where the time gap between writing and 
printing sensitive material is brief weeklies and monthlies face 
the problem of protecting potentially marketmoving items over a 
period of days and weeks 
the problem is compounded in masscirculation magazines which 
rely on printing plants at several locations and the honesty of 
hundreds of printers couriers truckers and postal workers who 
have access before subscribers do 
theres a real limitation on our ability to place guards on 
every truck said landon y jones managing editor of money a 
monthly with a circulation of 18 million 
jones said money sent a letter to its printer world color press 
in effingham ill after the business week scandal surfaced 
warning that the material they handle is property of money 
magazine it is their obligation to protect moneys property as it 
passes through their hands 
he said a check of moneys wall street column and other 
potentially sensitive material going back at least one year found 
no suspicious trading 
at forbes also printed by world color press deputy managing 
editor lawrence minard said the 740000circulation weekly and its 
printer historically have had a firm understanding about 
confidentiality 
nevertheless minard said we did reiterate to world color 
that we expect the agreement weve had with them to be vigilantly 
observed 
minard said there was no effort at forbes to recheck back 
issues but he said i suppose on a continuing basis i very 
unofficially monitor it 
for their part donnelley world color and brown printing co of 
wauseca minn which prints fortune have undertaken security 
crackdowns 
besides dismissing employees implicated in the business week 
scandal chicagobased donnelley has reminded all workers of a ban 
on removing any material from plants others have done likewise 
donnelley also has uniformed sentries at exits plainclothes 
guards patrolling production lines and a policy that workers 
clothing may be searched nevertheless spokesman james ratcliffe 
said the company still must largely rely on employees integrity 
to frisk 650 people would be a bit impractical he said

for the past 13 years three national armies 
and two guerrilla insurgencies have been fighting in southwestern 
africa now finally there is hope that an end to the conflict may 
be within reach 
the latest step in the process occurred monday when south 
african foreign minister roelof botha said a de facto cessation 
of hostilities is now in effect in angola the scene of direct or 
indirect military involvement by the soviet union the united 
states cuba and south africa 
the imponderables in the region are many and just keeping track 
of all the players is no small achievement 
the cubans have been in angola since that countrys independence 
from portuguese rule in 1975 south africans have fought 
intermittently in angola worried about marxist penetration in an 
area close to home the angolan army of course has been a major 
player arrayed against both the south africans and a usbacked 
rebel group finally in namibia a black nationalist liberation 
movement has been fighting south african colonial control 
the trick for us diplomats led by assistant secretary of 
state chester crocker is to devise a formula that would induce 
each of the five to lay down its arms 
for years progress was negligible but things began to change 
when crocker serving as peace mediator succeeded in convening a 
meeting of south african cuban and angolan authorities in london 
last may 
at that meeting and in three subsequent sessions the outlines 
of a settlement have come into view 
following is a brief summary of the interests of each party 
south africa it has said for years that it would be willing to 
allow independence and black majority rule in namibia so long as 
the estimated 50000 cubans leave angola in a reasonable time 
continued colonial control of namibia has been expensive for south 
africa and the departure of the cubans would ease its security 
concerns about angola 
cuba its initial reason for becoming involved in angola was to 
protect a marxist ally against south african military encroachment 
if the south africans promise to leave that would remove the 
excuse for which the cubans were sent to angola in the first place 
cuba could withdraw its troops with its head held high claiming 
that angola was now safe from south african aggression 
angola it has been devastated by years of warfare a cuban 
withdrawal could make the government more vulnerable to attacks by 
the anticommunist guerrilla movement on the other hand the unita 
rebels under the package deal now being negotiated would no longer 
receive assistance from south africa whose forces would be 
withdrawn to within the countrys national boundaries 
swapo known formally as the southwest africa peoples 
organization swapo is the namibian rebel group that has been 
fighting south african colonial rule for more than 20 years once 
south africa consents to elections for an independent government 
swapo can finally lay down its arms and reintegrate into namibian 
society 
the soviet union it has poured hundreds of millions of dollars 
into angola in support of its ally over the years moscow has been 
showing increasing eagerness in promoting a settlement apparently 
intent on cutting costs in an area of minimal strategic concern 
the united states its main interest is eliminating the cuban 
military presence in africa cubas inclination to send large 
expeditionary forces to distant lands has long been a sore point in 
washington for the past three years the reagan administration has 
been sending military aid to the unita rebels in angola 
unitas fate is not under discussion in the usmediated talks 
which are focused exclusively on external involvement in the 
region the united states has been prodding the angolan government 
to open national reconciliation talks with unita 
a key hurdle will come later this month when the parties attempt 
to reach agreement on a timetable for cuban withdrawal from angola 
diplomats have never been more optimistic but botha is advising 
caution insisting that the cease fire is the first step of a 
very long arduous road to peace

after a thousand years of arabpersian 
hostility and eight of war peace is a precious but chimeric 
commodity for iran and iraq 
yet after a yearlong un peace effort and two weeks of 
delicate for a time deadlocked negotiations a truce if not a 
lasting peace is at hand 
on monday secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar announced 
that the guns would fall silent on aug 20 and both sides would 
meet five days later in geneva for facetoface peace talks under 
un auspices 
i am persuaded that both nations deeply wanted peace and are 
committed to it he said and that opened the way 
it also opens the way for improved relations between the united 
states and iran a reduced us naval presence in the persian gulf 
and a better atmosphere in which to seek release of foreign 
hostages held by proiranian shiite moslem fundamentalists in 
lebanon 
the occasion marks the first time in memory that a un 
resolution has been a key to ending a conflict numerous 
resolutions pertaining to the middle east and southern africa have 
gone unheeded 
resolution 598 the yearold persian gulf peace plan is 
coming to fruition 
the ceasefire announcement was the second major victory for 
perez de cuellar since april when pakistan and afghanistan signed 
a unmediated pact providing for the withdrawal of soviet troops 
from afghanistan 
as in the case of afghanistan a un plan and mechanism already 
was in place when the belligerents turned to new york 
mondays proclamation also signifies a revival of the 
financially ailing united nations after years of lying fallow and 
ineffective among other tasks it is now expected to play a 
peacekeeping role in southern africa and cambodia 
for iran and iraq the ceasefire announcement is only the 
beginning of a long problematic road both belligerents gave way 
at the bargaining table because of economic and political 
compulsions their weariness of war not their dedication to peace 
both now claim political victory and say the other side gave way 
the two shattered nations have nothing to show for the conflict 
that has claimed up to 1 million lives the battle lines today are 
much as they were in september 1980 when iraq invaded iran after a 
series of border skirmishes 
if anything the bitterness is greater and iraqs massive and 
frequent use of internationally abhorred and outlawed poison gas 
has increased the enmity 
the ceasefire announcement is the culmination of un peace 
efforts that began on july 20 1987 when the security council 
adopted resolution 598 demanding an immediate ceasefire and 
setting out a peace plan 
for a full year perez de cuellar negotiated with both sides 
last year iraq was losing the war and immediately accepted 
resolution 598 which calls for a troop withdrawal prisoner 
exchange establishment of a tribunal to assess responsibility for 
the damage formal peace talks and reconstruction 
iran which was winning held out it demanded that as a 
precondition for peace iraq must be branded the aggressor 
for a full year iran was branded the obstructor of peace for 
not embracing the resolution 
now a year later the tables are turned 
after a series of battlefield setbacks iran abruptly announced 
on july 18 that it was embracing resolution 598 and urged an 
immediate ceasefire 
tehran dropped the precondition of branding iraq the aggressor 
irans supreme leader the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini said 
that making the choice for peace was worse than swallowing 
poison 
the secretarygeneral declared he would send a ceasefire 
mission to both countries and summoned the foreign ministers of 
both nations for peace talks 
but iraq which was on the offensive suddenly demanded direct 
talks with iran as a precondition of a ceasefire 
iran said direct talks could be held only after a ceasefire 
troop withdrawal and prisoner exchange 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati of iran and his iraqi 
counterpart tariq aziz came to new york but unmediated 
negotiations deadlocked over the issue of direct talks 
iran appeared to be the peacemaker while iraq held back 
perez de cuellar then devised a formula under which a truce 
would be followed rapidly by direct talks on a comprehensive peace 
iran agreed immediately 
on saturday president saddam hussein of iraq said he would go 
along with direct talks after a ceasefire dropping his objections 
that was the breakthrough 
the restoration of peace will bring to the peoples of both 
countries victories far greater than those of war perez de 
cuellar said monday

astronomers searching for radio signals from 
intelligent life beyond the earth say circumstantial evidence is 
growing that humankind is not alone in the universe 
reports of the discovery of new planets and of the presence of 
complex organic chemicals on comets are encouraging michael j 
klein manager of nasas radio search for life said monday 
research announced at the international astronomical unions 
20th assembly last week showed the discovery of at least 10 
planetlike objects in orbit of distant stars other studies showed 
that comets and cosmic dust particles contain the complex organic 
compounds that are thought to have been the chemical precursors of 
life 
that is the circumstantial evidence that life exists 
elsewhere klein said we know now that the materials are 
there it gives us a good feeling that we are on the right track 
klein heads a project called the search for extraterrestial 
intelligence or seti that is planning to mount an intensified 
search for radio signals from civilizations that may exist on 
planets orbiting distant stars 
programs run by the national aeronautics and space 
administration harvard university and others have listened for 
intelligencedirected radio signals for more than 20 years but 
only a small fraction of the vast universe and the many radio 
frequencies that must be monitored actually have been checked 
the jet propulsion laboratory which is operated by the 
california institute of technology for nasa has proposed expanding 
the effort with sophisticated new equipment that would listen to 
tens of millions of channels at the same time the equipment would 
be monitoried by a computer capable of identifying signals that 
could be sent by intelligent life 
klein said the new equipment would be able to look at 1000 
different stars that are thought to be similar to the earths sun 
locations that experts believe hold the best chance for the 
evolution of life 
there also would be whole sky survey in many radio 
frequencies in which every portion of the heavens would be searched 
systematically 
searches in the past have only scratched the surface said 
klein 
the new equipment would be 10 million times more thorough than 
present equipment he said noting in the first few minutes we 
would be able to match all of the searches that were done before 
but even with the new devices the job is immense said frank 
drake chairman of a seti committee of the astronomical union and 
an astronomer at the university of california at santa cruz 
many people think the project should succeed in the next year 
or two he said thats probably not going to happen the 
universe is so huge and the cosmic haystack so large it will take 
us decades 
but drake added the consequences of success are so great that 
its worth dealing with the problems 
the theory behind the seti work is that because there are 
billions of galaxies each with billions of stars the odds are 
good that the conditions that permitted life to evolve on earth 
also exist elsewhere 
if so then intelligent life could have developed along the same 
lines as it did here on earth civilizations that are equal to or 
more advanced than humankind would be sending out signals just as 
occurs on earth the seti project is looking for those signals 
such signals may leak out just as they do on earth drake 
said 
the strongest sign of our existence in the universe is the 
accumulation of our television signals he said the second most 
common radio signal from earth comes from military communications 
klein said the federal budget now under consideration by 
congress includes a 6 million appropriation for the enhanced seti 
equipment he said the total project would last 10 years and cost 
90 million 
if the funding were approved the intensified search could begin 
in 1992 with all of the new equipment operating by 1994

shes only fifth in line to the throne but from 
the hospital crowds to the headlines the birth of britains newest 
princess has shown the royal family working a magic that defies 
even the experts 
i cant think why theres such hysterical interest really 
said charles kidd editor of debretts peerage which chronicles 
britains blue bloods 
but it just keeps increasing maybe its because theres 
been a leveling out of social classes which is very good but at 
the same time does make for rather boring reading kidd said in 
an interview 
and these characters are supposed to be a bit bigger than 
life or were led to believe they are he added 
and so they seemed tuesday 
almost all of britains dozen national newspapers splashed 
across their front pages the monday night birth of the princess of 
york to queen elizabeths second son andrew and his wife sarah 
radio and television networks led bulletins repeatedly with the 
news edging out the ceasefire agreement in the iraniraq war 
only the communist morning star and the newest upscale 
newspaper the 375000circulation independent ignored or paid 
little attention to the birth of the queens fifth grandchild 
we are not much interested in minor royals but we did record 
the event said john price news editor of the independent which 
gave the story three lines on page 2 the independents view is 
that these people dont matter 
it was a lonely view 
compared with the attention given to europes other major 
surviving monarchies the spanish the scandinavians the dutch 
and the belgians britain erupted with royal fever 
the monarchs of sweden denmark and norway attract plenty of 
attention among their scandinavian subjects but not much elsewhere 
in the netherlands by the time former queen julianas youngest 
grandchild also juliana was born in october 1981 interest in 
royal babies had cooled the little juliana was the exqueens 13th 
grandchild 
in sweden the birth in 1982 of a third child princess 
madeleine to king carl gustaf and queen silvia dominated the 
local news but did not make world headlines 
royal babies not in direct line to the throne receive scant 
attention only one newspaper in norway mentioned the birth in 
brazil last month of norwegian king olavs second greatgrandchild 
in belgium pictures of king baudouin and queen fabiola seldom 
appear in then news the heir to the throne baudouins nephew 
prince albert keeps even further out of the limelight 
in contrast the royal family of the tiny principality of monaco 
has the photographers in hot pursuit particularly princess 
caroline and princess stephanie daughters of prince rainier and 
the late grace kelly 
but even for them the scrutiny palls compared to the life of 
the british monarchs children and their offspring 
harold brooksbaker publishing director of burkes peerage 
attributes the publicity given andrews wife sarah partly to what 
he says has become an international hobby british royalwatching 
and partly to her unusual background for a royal bride 
the former sarah ferguson had no title was a commoner had two 
serious romances before andrew and pursued her career in a graphic 
arts company 
he believes that historians will credit the former miss ferguson 
with taking the royal family into the 21st century 
from the literally thousands of letters we get from 
americans germans japanese wanting information about the royal 
family its clear that royalwatching has become as much a hobby 
as stampcollecting said brooksbaker 
the birth of the princess of york received more publicity in 
britain than did the birth in 1947 of prince charles heir to the 
throne he said 
this interest in things royal is a great snowball 
interesting and also terrifying said brooksbaker 
as this soap opera becomes more and more universal one 
wonders where it is going to end and whether it will crush the very 
people it is portraying i dont know

sen lowell weicker of connecticut sat alone 
as he delivered an impassioned plea to a republican platform panel 
urging his gop brethren to stand firm against apartheid in south 
africa 
the regime in south africa is no better than the regime in 
nazi germany in the 30s he said that regime tried to do to 
the jewish people what south africa is doing to the blacks 
weicker playing a role he perfected in 1984 is practically the 
sole dissenter in this weeks platform deliberations 
after weickers testimony conservative activist donald devine 
said it looks like mr weicker is doing his usual thing going 
around making a lot of noise and not getting any votes 
alone among prominent republicans weicker has taken it upon 
himself to push for some moderatetoliberal platform planks 
positions that are almost certain not to emerge from the draft for 
next weeks gop platform 
weicker also has prepared platform proposals calling for support 
of the equal rights amendment and an activist approach toward the 
aids crisis he said he plans to press for adoption of the planks 
in drafting sessions later this week 
weicker is generally unpopular among the conservative activists 
who dominate the republican platform process and when his 
testimony ended several subcommittee members unburdened themselves 
of several polite but insistent questions about his antiapartheid 
stand 
what about your call for support for frontline states of 
southern africa including marxistrun angola 
what further economic sanctions you said an oil embargo 
if necessary 
while weicker was tilting at windmills witnesses who gave 
presentations for the strategic defense initiative a continuation 
of reagan administration economic policy and support for the 
nicaraguan rebels received general and positive queries that 
enabled them to score easy points 
fred ikle former undersecretary of defense testified that the 
united states should maintain a steady growth in the defense 
budget continue its support for anticommunist rebels and work 
toward the deployment of sdi the missile defense system known as 
star wars 
the question to ikle what would have happened if the country 
had adopted democratic nominee michael dukakis views seven years 
ago 
answer wed be in a period of crisis rolling out the red 
carpet for soviet expansion and have no intermediaterange 
nuclear forces treaty 
daniel graham the former head of the defense intelligence 
agency testified that president reagans star wars plan is a 
strategic master stroke comparable to the louisiana 
purchase the monroe doctrine and the apollo space program 
grahams comments brought smiles to the faces of the 
subcommittee members there were no questions 
weicker drew a few murmurs in the audience when he first 
compared south africa to nazi germany citing the governments 
policy of strict racial segregation of blacks 
when a panelist sought help to understand that view weicker 
said 
south africa has done by law exactly what nazi germany did by 
law he responded 
his antiapartheid plank would say as the historical party of 
individual rights the republican party rejects apartheid and seeks 
its abolition we believe the united states has a moral 
responsibility to impose in concert with other nations further 
economic sanctions including an oil embargo if necessary to 
bring this heinous practice to an end 
weicker agreed with his questioners that an oil embargo and 
other economic sanctions probably would hurt the united states 
financially but pleaded with the panels sense of humanity 
if that didnt work there was weickers argument that the 
united states needed a stronger presence on the african continent 
especially in the face of marxistled countries such as angola 
and if that failed there was always the comparison with the 
democrats who in their platform labeled south africa a terrorist 
state 
it shouldnt be a democratic issue weicker said noting 
that a republicancontrolled congress passed the initial economic 
sanctions against south africa and a gop congress overrode reagans 
veto 
and as he stood up ready to leave the conference room weicker 
brandishing his republicanism said defiantly im not taking 
a back seat to the democrats on any issue especially when they 
have a mealymouth platform

president reagan says congress has not moved 
quickly enough on welfare reform and urban renewal and he told the 
nations governors theyve been way out front on many social 
issues 
reagan a former twoterm governor of california used a speech 
to the governors monday to tout his new federalism policy of 
shifting more responsibility for social programs away from the 
federal government and onto the states 
many governors especially democrats have complained that the 
states cannot absorb increasing cuts in federal aid while 
maintaining services for their citizens during his speech at the 
national governors associations meeting in cincinnati reagan 
described his effort as one giving states a leadership role 
we have broken the federal government of its compulsion to 
control every breath the states take he said 
reagan facing a host of lastminute issues on capitol hill as 
lawmakers draw near a recess for the republican national 
convention was playing host to republican congressional leaders at 
the white house today 
in his cincinnati speech reagan complained that congress has 
not acted on legislation he submitted six years ago proposing that 
the most depressed areas of americas cities receive tax breaks to 
encourage business investment 
despite some minor moves last year congress still has failed 
to pass meaningful enterprise zone legislation he said not 
you over half the states have gone forward with their own 
enterprise zones 
reagan also said the states have moved more quickly to get 
people off welfare rolls 
welfare reform is another field in which you have been way out 
front he said congress today is still debating a welfare 
reform package years after states started taking advantage of the 
greater flexibility we gave them 
reagan said the federal government should not merely let the 
states toss ideas into a suggestion box but that it should 
honor the leadership role the states have to play 
reagan won compliments from republican gov thomas kean of new 
jersey who said the president was talking language we 
understand 
but democratic gov bill clinton of arkansas said reagan gave a 
political speech designed mainly to help vice president george bush 
in the presidential election 
the governors association has said it wants its meeting to be 
nonpartisan clinton said i think it was as political as he 
could be without stepping out of line 
earlier reagan toured a us precision lens inc plant telling 
managers and employees he resents talk about the rust belt in 
the nations midwest 
i get a little tired of hearing cincinnati and other 
midwestern cities called the rust belt when the midwest isnt the 
rust belt its the boom belt

friends of the endangered sea turtle are upset 
because a prizewinning danish film babettes feast has 
turtle soup on the menu 
they are investigating a report from a florida restaurant that 
it got some sea turtle meat from san francisco for use in a dinner 
to promote the film 
theres a gelatinous substance called calipee under the shell 
of the sea turtle thats the basis for turtle soup explained 
marydele donnelly director of the sea turtle rescue fund in a 
telephone interview monday 
actually the turtle you see beating its flippers in the film 
seems to be a loggerhead which is a different species that doesnt 
have the calipee she said but both are on the endangered 
species list and its illegal to catch them in this country 
the film is based on a short story by danish writer isak 
dinesen pen name of the late baroness karen blixenfinecke who 
also wrote out of africa 
babettes feast tells of a frenchwoman living on the coast 
of denmark who spends her lottery winnings on a big dinner for the 
villagers who have befriended her in her long exile the motion 
picture academy awarded it an oscar as the best foreign film of the 
year 
lawrence lanezucker who is helping promote the film for orion 
classics said its food consultant has worked up substitute recipes 
using shitake mushrooms and chopped breast of duck about 90 
restaurants have been interested in reproducing the sevencourse 
meal he said 
ms donnelly said some restaurants are using diamondback 
terrapin which is not a sea turtle but is found in estuaries and 
considered endangered in some places ms donnelly says 10000 
terrapin a year are sold in new york fish markets and the new york 
turtle and tortoise society is trying to get it put on the states 
endangered list 
groceries sell a mock turtle soup which she says is made 
from land turtles they are not on anyones endangered list but 
she would prefer nobody ate turtle soup at all 
turtles in the soup recipe for disaster is the title of an 
article written by ms donnelly for the august issue of cee 
report published by the center for environmental education 
meanwhile sea turtles werent faring well in congress on 
monday where the house approved legislation to bar the reagan 
administration temporarily from carrying out a plan to require 
shrimp fishermen to use devices to protect the reptiles 
turtles often drown when snared in shrimp nets 
the bill sent to the senate by voice vote would prohibit the 
mandatory use of socalled turtle excluder devices before sept 30 
a month after excluderdevice regulations were slated to take 
effect 
the delay would give house and senate negotiators time to work 
out differences in their versions of legislation to reauthorize the

some bribes can help third world countries get 
ahead and can make a positive contribution to society a 
politics professor writes in a magazine published by an affiliate 
of the us chamber of commerce 
david osterfeld who teaches politics at saint josephs college 
in rensselaer ind argues that it is useful to a country if a 
government charges 1000 for a license to enter an occupation but 
an official issues one for a bribe of 900 
the reduced cost facilitates entry into the field thereby 
introducing an element of competition into an otherwise 
monopolistic situation he says in an article called corruption 
and development 
osterfelds article appears in the current issue of the 
quarterly journal of economic growth published by the national 
chamber foundation the foundation is a research affiliate of the 
us chamber of commerce a private business organization 
the trade bill now awaiting president reagans signature will 
ease the effect of the foreign corrupt practices act and make it 
easier for executives here to defend themselves when their agents 
are charged with paying bribes abroad 
osterfeld doesnt defend all bribes saying that some are 
wicked 
for instance the alleged involvement of panamas military 
ruler gen manuel noriega in the drug trade is a case of 
corruption in all of its wickedness where society is clearly 
hurt he says 
however a peruvian street vendors bribing of a lowlevel 
government official in order to obtain a license to sell his wares 
while also a corrupt act makes a positive contribution to 
society he wrote 
osterfeld says that even if the bribe is several times the size 
of the license fee as an indian investigating committee found was 
often the case the bribe is still useful 
it not only benefits the bureaucrat but more importantly 
insures that the licenses are allocated efficiently since those 
able to offer the highest bribes are the most productive and 
efficient firms he adds 
there was disagreement from lilia ferroclerico a uruguayan who 
coordinates caribbean and central american studies for johns 
hopkins universitys school of advanced international studies 
thats pretty farfetched she said in a telephone interview 
i dont think corruption is ever helpful you have a parallel 
here in the pentagon scandal all the bribes did was to make it 
more expensive for the taxpayer 
osterfeld defends what he calls expansive corruption which 
he says increases chances for trade that benefits a country 
it entails increased competition and market flexibility he 
says 
the result is that the quantity of goods produced expands and 
their quality improves it is in short characterized by the 
expansion of the overall wealth of society 
it is morally defensible since its goal is to defend ones 
own property as well as ones right to engage in voluntary 
activities 
as examples of expansive corruption he suggests 
evading price controls or tariffs by bribes to officials to 
permit smuggling or black marketing 
bribes to evade licensing restrictions or controls on 
immigration and emigration 
bribing a judge in cases of smuggling occupational licenses 
black marketing and price controls are called defensive bribing 
and osterfeld classifies that as expansive as well 
even if society becomes demoralized or disillusioned by such 
corruption the effects may not be an impediment to development 
he adds 
he explains that the cynicism may lead to increased selfseeking 
that furthers development 
osterfeld concludes that expansive corruption is a response 
to government restrictions on economic freedom those concerned 
about it who want economic development should concentrate on 
reducing government action that tempts corruption he says

baseball after dark dawned monday at wrigley 
field the last majorleague ballpark with dayonly games but rain 
put out the lights early 
the first night game in the 74year history of wrigley field 
between the cubs and the philadelphia phillies was delayed by a 
downpour in the bottom of the fourth inning it was officially 
postponed two hours 15 minutes later wiping out the cubs 31 
lead since the game will have to be replayed 
philadelphias phil bradley led off by hitting a home run into 
the leftcenter field seats of wrigley field which for 40 years 
had been the sole major league ballpark to hold out against lights 
chicago fans mood brightened however after the home team came 
back with a first inning homer by ryne sandberg 
the cubs mired in fourth place in the national league east 
division scored two more runs before thundershowers forced a delay 
god is talking said 26yearold jim herrmann who had just 
fled the stadium he doesnt want night games at wrigley field 
authorities reported at least five arrests through the rain 
delay including three for ticket scapling and two vendor 
violations but few other problems except for illegally parked 
cars 
mayor eugene sawyer toured the surrounding wrigleyville 
neighborhood before entering the park and predicted that residents 
some of whom equate cubs baseball with daylight would get used to 
night games 
i think as we advance the whole plan and get people used to 
night games im optimistic it will eventually smooth out sawyer 
said 
its a historical moment but it disturbs me because i dont 
want people to use my gangway as a bathroom or throw bottles in my 
alley said carmelo flores 32 a wrigley field neighbor painting 
his fence monday afternoon 
we live here and the people in this neighborhood take care of 
it but some fans just dont respect the community he said 
even president reagan was struck by the history of the moment 
reagan boarding air force one in cincinnati on monday was 
asked what he thought of the first night baseball game at wrigley 
field 
im too oldfashioned said reagan who early in his radio 
career did reenactments of cubs games for stations in iowa 
theres nothing like daytime baseball but i understand the 
need for lights box office 
chicago police scheduled 172 officers including mounted police 
and canine units and revved up 15 tow trucks for illegally parked 
cars the normal phalanx for day games is about 50 police said 
officer william kernan 
permit parking is available only for residents of the 
neighborhood of turnofthe century two and threeflat apartments 
that is becoming upscale from its workingclass roots 
outside the park monday the excitement began early throngs of 
fans some of whom had been there since 8 pm sunday for the best 
of the general admission bleacher seats lined the streets while 
tshirt vendors hawked homemade wares some of the parking lot 
operators near the park put up new prices 15 in one case 
ivycovered wrigley field held on to daytimeonly baseball 
decades longer than any other ballpark in the nation joining the 
fraternity of the illumined 40 years after the last team to light 
up the detroit tigers 
the chicago city council voted in february to lift the ban on 
lights and lights are scheduled to burn brightly in the north side 
stadium seven times this season and 18 times next season 
the 5 million lighting system has already added a modern flare 
to the blue and white wrigley field which was built in 1914 to 
house the chicago whales of the shortlived federal league 
there were more than a few attempts to pull the plug on lights 
even before 91yearold cubs fan harry grossman could throw a 
ceremonial switch to illuminate the field for the first time 
the tribune co announced soon after it bought the chicago cubs 
in 1981 that it intended to put lights in the ballpark saying 
dayonly baseball cost the company revenue from televised night 
games 
but wrigleyville residents took on the media company and managed 
to keep the ban on lights alive for almost seven years 
citizens united for baseball in the sunshine cubs 
spearheaded efforts that included lobbying city and state 
officials the group decried problems with rowdy crowds traffic 
and parking it said would accompany night games 
cubs planned to monitor the neighborhood monday for material to 
use in a planned court action to limit night games said mike 
quigley the groups vice president quigley refused to give 
details of the court battle but said it would begin wednesday 
the end of an era also brought out the entrepreneur in some 
neighbors 
my mom rented out our roof to some suburban rich people 
junior cruz 19 said monday afternoon at his home across from the 
ballpark shes even got a gate around the top so if they get 
drunk they wont fall off the side

the us nuclear power industry its image 
tarnished by events such as three mile island which led to a 
decadelong dearth of construction of new nuclear plants is 
mounting a comeback in the waning weeks of the 100th congress 
first the house and senate have sent president reagan 
legislation that would continue the industrys protection unique 
in federal law against being required to pay unlimited amounts of 
money to victims of a reactor accident 
and on monday the senate approved legislation long sought by 
the nuclear industry to streamline the licensing process for new 
nuclear plants and to attempt to revitalize the moribund us 
uranium industry 
industry spokesman have said that a new licensing process along 
with a standardized plant design they hope the process will 
produce will break the drought that has seen no new nuclear plant 
construction in this decade 
the licensing and uranium provisions were added on the senate 
floor to legislation that would convert the nuclear regulatory 
commission from a fivemember panel to a nuclear safety agency 
headed by a chief administrator 
the bill approved 896 also would strengthen nrc procedures 
for investigating nuclear plant accidents and wrongdoing by nrc 
employees 
however none of the several house committees that share 
jurisdiction over the legislation has held hearings on all of the 
senate bills many elements it was considered unlikely that the 
complex legislation would clear congress in the five weeks 
remaining on the schedule for the 1988 session 
the liability bill sent to reagan a 15year renewal of the 1957 
priceanderson act would set 71 billion as the maximum amount 
the owners of nuclear generators would have to pay in damages 
arising from a single accident 
that amount is 10 times the previous liability cap it is about 
triple what the industry was lobbying for but it could have been 
far worse from the industrys standpoint 
some government reports have estimated that a major nuclear 
accident could cause 100 billion in damages environmental groups 
and the ralph nader organization had been pushing for unlimited 
liability for the industry 
officials of the office of management and budget say it is 
likely that reagan will sign the priceanderson reauthorization 
which leaves it to congress to decide how to find the money needed 
to pay more than 71 billion in damages 
barring an accident requiring large payments to victims the 
higher liability limit is not expected to have any major impact on 
electricity rates charged by utilities with nuclear plants 
according to congressional staffers 
sen james mcclure ridaho added the amendment monday to the 
nrc restructuring bill that would scrap the process under which a 
new plant must get separate construction and operating licenses 
from the agency 
the industry has blamed much of its problems in getting new 
plants built on the nrcs twostep process it has said that a 
single license would spur development of cheaper standardized 
plant designs 
the uranium industry also won a longsought provision with a 
7817 vote for an amendment that would force plant operators to pay 
a federal fee if they obtain more than 375 percent of their 
reactor uranium from foreign sources 
the amendment by sens wendell ford dky and pete domenici 
rnm also would create governmentowned corporation to take over 
the us uranium enrichment program and spend 750 million to 
acquire up to 30 million pounds of uranium by 1996 
their plan also would authorize spending about 1 billion to 
clean up uranium tailings the waste created by uranium mining 
activities in western states 
voting against the bill monday were bill bradley dnj mark 
hatfield rore gordon humphrey rnh frank lautenberg 
dnj patrick leahy dvt and william proxmire dwis 
not voting were joseph biden ddel alan cranston dcalif

a fair housing bill the first major expansion 
of civil rights laws in two decades is heading to the white house 
for the signature of president reagan who has endorsed the measure 
the legislation gives federal officials new power to enforce 
fair housing laws and extends antidiscrimination protection to the 
disabled and families with children 
the bill was approved monday by the house with no debate final 
congressional passage came in a nearly deserted chamber as a few 
house members concurred by voice vote in amendments approved last 
week by the senate 
the original fair housing law passed in 1968 after the 
assassination of civil rights leader martin luther king jr gave 
the federal government only a mediation role in settling housing 
disputes 
under the new bill the secretary of housing and urban 
development is empowered to go to court to seek stiff fines against 
property owners accused of discrimination 
current protections against racial and sexual discrimination are 
extended to the handicapped and to families with children under 18 
in addition the bill says new residences with at least four 
units would have to be accessible to the handicapped 
the added protection for families with young children 
effectively ends adults only restrictions except for 
exemptions for retirement communities for the elderly

republicans may have to wait until the 1996 
election to break the ties that bind their party to following the 
wishes of state legislatures controlled by democrats 
a gop panel on monday dropped a proposal to give the national 
party more centralized authority a notion that makes many 
republicans squeamish because thats how the democrats operate 
the decision by the republican national committees rules 
committee if left standing by the convention next week means the 
partys current system for picking national convention delegates 
will remain in place through the 1992 presidential primaries and 
caucuses 
one way or another we ought to be masters of our own fate 
said roger allan moore rnc general counsel who asked for the 
withdrawal of his proposal to centralize gop authority 
i think the democrats have done a lot of damage to themselves 
with their rules said grace boulton a gop national 
committeewoman from oklahoma who advocated a rival proposal that 
would have given state parties the right to overrule state laws 
governing party procedures 
i just think to have any kind of national committee or group 
approving state party rules is the wrong way to go she said 
dropping the two competing proposals was part of a compromise 
worked out earlier this summer ms boulton said 
republican rules currently require state parties to adhere to 
local laws such as those establishing and scheduling primaries in 
picking their national convention delegates 
moore said the problem with this is there are 36 states where 
we do not control the legislatures and thus democrats are allowed 
to govern what ought to be matters of internal republican party 
policy 
the issue arose during the 1988 election when southern state 
legislatures controlled by democrats decided to hold their 
primaries on one day which became known as super tuesday march 8 
some republican state parties raised objections but were powerless 
to do anything more 
supreme court decisions have said that the parties not the 
states have the final say over their internal operations 
including the selection of delegates to presidential nominating 
conventions 
moore said that under those decisions the national parties 
clearly have the authority to overrule state law but it is unclear 
whether state parties can exercise the same authority 
the supreme court is considering a case dealing with that very 
issue but moore said he did not believe the ruling would go in 
favor of the state parties 
moore said his proposal was not intended to allow the national 
party to meddle in state party affairs but he acknowledged there 
was a fear it would put the gop on the slippery slope to where 
the democrats are

novelist nikos kazantzakis who created 
joy of life with zorba the greek and a religious storm with 
the last temptation of christ remains popular in his native 
land 30 years after his death 
his novels sell thousands of copies every year mainly in greek 
but also in english french german and japanese he is believed to 
be the mostread writer in modern greek 
we have a huge turnover in the halfdozen major kazantzakis 
novels in greek hes mostly bought by young people and then 
the tourists pick up the foreign language copies said byron 
dokimakis he owns a leading bookstore in heraklion capital of 
crete the island where kazantzakis was born 
dokimakis said the two most popular novels are zorba an 
exuberant portrayal set on crete of a man with a huge zest for 
life and last temptation which presents jesus as a weak 
unstable man who doubts his divinity and dreams of making love to 
mary magdalene the reformed sinner 
michael cacoyannis awardwinning 1963 film version of zorba 
the greek starring anthony quinn has become a classic martin 
scorseses the last temptation of christ to be released 
friday has provoked protest and outrage by christian groups in the 
united states 
such a reaction comes as no surprise in greece the greek 
orthodox church condemned the book as heretical when it was 
published in 1954 and nearly excommunicated kazantzakis 
george moustakis a greek theologian said kazantzakis escaped 
excommunication only because the cretans were so angry they 
threatened to burn every church on the island if it went through 
theres still a puritan streak in american life thats bound 
to be offended by the film he added and im sure that its 
release in greece will bring protests from the church 
the vatican also blacklisted the novel in 1954 italian director 
franco zeffirelli said he would withdraw his young toscanini 
from the venice film festival later this month if scorseses movie 
was scheduled to be shown just before or after it 
kazantzakis acknowledged strong personal identification with the 
tormented character of christ he portrayed but said the book was 
an affirmation of faith 
i am certain that every free man who reads this book so 
filled as it is with love will more than ever before love 
christ he wrote in the introduction 
on crete the largest greek island with a population of 550000 
kazantzakis is a hero symbolizing its tradition of radicalism and 
defiant independence 
he was born in 1883 into a farm family and studied in athens and 
paris as a young man he spent six months in a greek orthodox 
monastery on mount athos but later embraced a range of 
philosophies that included marxism buddhism and nihilism the 
denial of all meaning in life 
kazantzakis turned to novels late in life after completing what 
he called his lifes work the 33000line philosophical poem the 
odyssey a modern sequel he settled in antibes in southern 
france but always had fistful of earth from crete in his study 
when he died in 1957 kazantzakis was internationally acclaimed 
but embittered by his failure to win the nobel prize for 
literature he blamed that on the greek literary establishment 
he was always an outsider who never got along with the other 
literary personalities of his day like george seferis a greek 
poet who won the prize said katerina angelikirooke a poet her 
family knew kazantzakis well 
the establishment here still chooses to ignore him she 
said theres been no serious intellectual study of his work in 
greece 
a kazantzakis revival started seven years ago when premier 
andreas papandreous new socialist government made him required 
reading in public high schools 
rose kyriakakis 15 of heraklion said i love his books the 
way he uses the language the strange words and the great big 
ideas hes inspirational 
the greek orthodox church keeps official silence on kazantzakis 
but lay religious organizations still describe his work as 
blasphemous 
many literary critics dismiss his philosophy as naive and his 
dialect style as exaggerated and selfconscious 
kay cicellis a novelist reflected a common view among greek 
writers i find kazantzakis hopelessly oldfashioned his ideas 
belong in the 19th century and he forces the greek language into a 
rigid unpleasant mold 
readers disagree and enthusiasm for kazantzakis surmounts 
social and regional differences 
ms angelikirooke said he catches the popular imagination in 
a way that no other modern greek writer has done in a greek home 
with only a few books one of them will surely be a kazantzakis

georgia republicans spent more than six 
months feuding over control of the party and at the end of a 
fourhour hearing on seating the states delegation at the national 
convention they wanted more time 
the georgia gop which was overrun earlier this year by 
dissidents and supporters of television evangelist pat robertson 
has tried to regroup after local conventions dissolved into shoving 
matches bullhorns and allegations of death threats 
moments after the state committees counsel completed his 
summation the attorney for the challengers asked for an additional 
10 minutes to present evidence 
john mcdonald of iowa chairman of the committee on contests 
ruled that that the case was closed but brant frost iv chairman 
of the dissident delegation stood up and asked to speak as a 
private citizen whose reputation had been brought into question 
the hearing remained closed 
the republican party has been asked to settle challenges to as 
many as 39 of the 48 delegates from georgia where republican 
nomineetobe george bush won the super tuesday primary but backers 
of robertson have tried to take over the state party 
the committee which ended the hearing after hours of testimony 
videotape presentations and boxes of evidence planned to rule 
sometime later in closeddoor session and will announce its 
decision when it reports to the full republican national committee 
on wednesday 
what we are engaged in here today is not a petty squabble 
georgia gop chairman john stuckey jr told the committee 
stuckey said that this was the opening battle in a war for 
control of the republican party by zealots and traditional 
malcontents 
however both stuckey and matthew patton the attorney for the 
opposing side said the dispute was more complicated than a 
disagreement over presidential politics 
the element of robertson vs bush has been greatly exaggerated 
by the news media said patton and picked up by the 
opposition 
in fact any decision over seating a delegation from georgia 
will not affect how the states presidential votes are cast next 
week at the national convention but it will determine who casts 
them 
because bush won the march 8 primary all 48 georgia delegates 
are required to vote for him at the national convention but the 
delegates themselves are picked through a process of caucuses and 
conventions it is in that process where the dissidents made their 
moves showing up in sufficient numbers to dominate the caucuses 
and obtaining a series of court orders to counter attempts by the 
state party to thwart them 
the feud led to fistfights and shoving matches at one 
congressional district convention and to an aborted state 
convention where dissidents with bullhorns controlled the floor 
shouting down speakers on the podium 
any reasonable person would concur in my opinion that i had to 
adjourn the convention to prevent a riot stuckey said of his 
decision to gavel a close to the may convention there was a 
clear and present danger of mayhem 
as evidence the state party showed a nineminute videotape that 
was a montage of television news stories about the district and 
state conventions the tape did show shouting and fist shaking at 
the state convention but it did not show any violence there 
stuckey said he had been under guard because of a death threat 
he had received at his hotel room in albany ga 
the challengers responded with their own videotape of the state 
convention showing stuckey gaveling the event to order later 
after motions to replace the chairman stuckey gaveled the 
convention closed the tape also showed the dissident delegates 
locked out of the convention hall 
the state party spent much of monday laying out its case while 
patton used much of the dissidents time to crossexamine the 
partys witnesses 
either side can appeal the rncs decision to the credentials 
committee of the national convention the ultimate authority on 
challenges is the national convention itself

the presidential campaign of vice president 
george bush says a campaignspending complaint filed with the 
federal election commission by four state democratic party chairmen 
is ridiculous 
the four chairmen asked the fec on monday to investigate whether 
the bush campaign has violated ederal election law by exceeding 
spending limits 
we file this complaint today to formally raise the issues of 
whether or not george bush has mismanaged his campaign funds and 
overspent the legal limit said richard wiener of michigan one 
of the filers and president of association of state democratic 
chairs 
mark goodin spokesman for the bush campaign called it a 
partisan challenge and said the campaign would welcome any 
inquiry by the fec 
i think its ridiculous said goodin this campaign has 
bent over backwards to comply with the letter and the spirit of the 
law 
wiener said that as of june 30 bush had spent 221 million of 
the 231 million he is allowed to spend for all prenomination 
campaign activities that wiener said left bush with only 
943000 to spend from july 1 through aug 18 when he is expected 
to receive the gop nomination 
wiener said bush has spent an average of about 1 million per 
month since march and traveled extensively in july going to 15 
cities in 14 states 
frankly we as state chairs wonder just how he is able to do 
all of the traveling that hes doing and all the campaigning hes 
doing in our states on that relatively limited amount of money 
said wiener it appears to us that the bush campaign is using a 
variety of techniques to avoid the spending cap 
wiener said those techniques may include delaying the reporting 
of campaign expenditures trying to take unlawful advantage of a 
loophole by allocating to state party committees or the national 
committee travel costs for socalled party building activities 
and characterizing some trips as official business when they are 
essentially campaign appearances 
as state chairs we believe that from our observation 
violations have occurred said wiener 
in their complaint the four chairmen ask the fec to conduct an 
immediate investigation into whether and by how much bush has 
exceeded the spending limit to issue an order to the bush campaign 
to stop spending federal funds and to suspend payment of any 
outstanding matching funds that still may be owed to the campaign 
in addition to wiener the other chairmen filing the complaint 
were james ruvolo of ohio frank holleman of south carolina and 
richard lodge of tennessee

next weeks republican national convention will 
have a distinct texas accent says the man who will nominate george 
bush for president 
it is clear in this convention that im doing the nominating 
and another texans doing the accepting and thats pretty much 
what conventions are about so its a texas show from that point of 
view sen phil gramm rtexas said monday 
however gramm said those watching the gop convention will hear 
something quite different from last months democratic convention 
where texas state treasurer ann richards set the tone with several 
wisecracks about bush during her keynote speech including that the 
wealthy vice president was born with a silver foot in his mouth 
youre going to see a stark contrast between my speech and the 
speeches you heard at the democratic convention gramm said 
gramm said he plans to use his speech to highlight the 
differences between vice president bush and dukakis 
i am not a good namecaller people dont care what i think 
about michael dukakis in terms of some cutesypoo thing i might 
call him he said 
still texas republicans have a tough act to follow 
texas democratic party officials have referred jokingly to last 
months democratic national convention in atlanta as their state 
convention due to the prominent role played by texans 
among them were sen lloyd bentsen the vice presidential 
nominee ms richards the keynoter us house speaker jim wright 
of fort worth convention chairman former us rep barbara 
jordan who seconded bentsens nomination agriculture commissioner 
jim hightower who gave a primetime speech and state rep lena 
guerrero daustin who helped present the party platform to 
delegates 
democrats also believe the selection of bentsen as dukakis 
running mate will help their ticket carry texas the nations 
thirdlargest state and its 29 electoral votes a total of 270 
electoral votes are needed to win the presidency 
the campaign in texas is going to be a hotly contested 
campaign gramm said weve got to put before the people of 
texas those two records if we dont win in texas given michael 
dukakis record we dont deserve to win

communist authorities say they will 
next year introduce an alternative for those who refuse compulsory 
18month military service making hungary the second east bloc 
country to offer the option 
while general compulsory service would remain in effect the 
government newspaper magyar hirlap said monday in consideration 
of hungarys national and international interests citizens are to 
be given a choice 
in june poland became the first warsaw pact country to 
establish an alternative civilian service 
last week a senior communist party official disclosed that 590 
conscientious objectors have refused to serve under arms in hungary 
since 1977 
ferenc szombathelyi deputy head of department in the partys 
central committee said 40 to 45 young people have been jailed 
annually for refusing to bear arms 
this practice must be changed now he told the party daily 
nepszabadsag 
at present people who refuse mandatory military service in 
hungary for reasons of conscience or religion are imprisoned for up 
to five years 
however jehovahs witnesses members of the church of the 
nazarene and seventhday adventists are exempted from military 
service 
according to magyar hirlap the alternative service is not to 
be punitive in nature nor more attractive than the armed service 
and carries no material advantages 
the substitutory civilian service the introduction of which 
will require amendments in the defense law will be adjusted to the 
18month long regular military national service the daily said 
without elaboration

tropical storm beryl hovered off the 
louisiana coast monday forcing the evacuation of thousands of oil 
rig workers in the gulf of mexico and driving vacationers away from 
raindrenched coastal resorts 
amid warnings of coastal tides five to seven feet above normal 
st bernard parish officials evacuated the fishing villages of 
hopedale yscloskey and shell beach east of new orleans late monday 
night 
beryl was upgraded monday from a tropical depression after its 
winds strengthened reaching a sustained speed of 50 mph with 
higher gusts in squalls up to 75 miles from the center 
the storm formed inland over lake pontchartrain near new orleans 
and strengthened as it drifted closer to the warm gulf of mexico 
the storm didnt deter vice president george bush from visiting 
new orleans on monday where he addressed the 1988 republican 
platform committee the republican national convention will be next 
week louisiana superdome 
better this week than next week said bill phillips 
convention manager 
at midnight edt the storms center was near latitude 295 north 
and longitude 890 west or about 65 miles southeast of new 
orleans it had remained stationary for about six hours after 
earlier drifting slowly southeastward 
forecasters said beryl was expected to begin a slow southerly or 
southwesterly drift tuesday with some strengthening possible and 
possible flooding especially in coastal communities east of the 
mississippi river 
its highly unusual for depressions to form over land most of 
the time they get their start way out in the middle of the ocean 
said jim gross a forecaster at the national hurricane center in 
miami we dont have a lot of experience with systems that form 
this way 
a tropical weather system becomes a named storm when its winds 
hit 39 mph and a hurricane when wind velocity reaches 74 mph 
residents of south louisiana especially in coastal communities 
were warned to prepare for flooding from high tides 
right now were advising people to listen to their radios and 
watch television said andy valence mayor of grand isle la 
about 40 miles south of new orleans in the gulf of mexico 
tropical storm warnings were posted from morgan city la to 
pensacola in the florida panhandle a small vessels warning was in 
effect from port oconnor texas to pensacola 
chevron spokesman jonathan lifa said about 2000 company workers 
were removed monday by boat and helicopter from facilities at 
venice and leeville deep in plaquemines parish and at morgan city 
the concern is that the more it gets into the gulf the more 
winds pick up it is something we are very concerned about lifa 
said 
jim shugart area manager for petroleum helicopters inc 
expected to spend the day getting workers out of danger 
it looks like were in for a full day of flying he said 
well just keep flying for as long as we can or until most of it 
is over 
beryl is the second named storm of the atlantic hurricane 
season the seasons first tropical storm alberto fizzled out 
monday near the canadian coast shortly after noon sunday the 
forecasters had issued a tropical storm warning for maines coast 
from bar harbor to eastport but canceled it in less than six hours 
rain from beryl battered coastal areas monday in louisiana 
mississippi alabama and florida and some tourists cut their 
vacations short 
weve had a lot of checkouts said joan burt general 
manager at the 102room econolodge in gulf shores ala 
carrie thomas who manages the alabama gulf coast convention 
center said guests who checked out early monday complained about 
the weather they dont want to get stuck in the event of a big 
storm she said 
meteorologist tom kriehn in mobile ala said residents there 
could expect 5 or 6 inches of rain in the next day or two but he 
said beryl could sit in the gulf two or three days until it gains 
strength or dies 
typically there are 10 named storms during the sixmonth 
hurricane season which begins june 1 last year there were only 
three hurricanes and four tropical storms in the atlantic 
the last major gulf coast hurricane was camille in 1969 with 
218 mph winds it killed 320 people and did millions in damage

a us appeals court ruling upholding a 
law requiring minors seeking abortions to notify both parents or 
get judicial permission will have disastrous effects a civil 
liberties lawyer says 
but a leader of minnesotas largest antiarbortion lobby said 
the ruling will provide needed safeguards for pregnant teenagers 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals in st louis by a 73 
vote overturned decisions by a federal judge and a threejudge 
panel of the appeals court the earlier rulings deemed the law 
unconstitutional 
rachael pine an attorney for the american civil liberties union 
in new york called mondays ruling was a disaster for minors in 
the state of minnesota the aclu brought the class action lawsuit 
on behalf of minors a parent four clinics and two physicians 
jackie schwietz executive director of minnesota citizens 
concerned for life an antiabortion group said the ruling 
affirms the right of minor girls to have their parents involved 
in this important medical decision 
its always amazed me that abortionists performing surgery on 
a child would do so without knowing the impact on her health 
schwietz said theres no way you can get an adequate history on 
the girl without parental involvement there are facts that may 
only be available to the abortionist from the parents 
us district judge donald alsop of st paul in november 1986 
barred the state from enforcing the notification law alsop said 
the required 48hour notice to both parents unduly burdened a 
minors right to seek an abortion particularly when the pregnant 
girl does not live with both parents 
but appeals judge john r gibson writing for the majority said 
the us supreme court has recognized as a matter of law that 
parental notice or consent requirements do not unconstitutionally 
burden a minors abortion rights when an appropriate judicial 
bypass is in place 
the supreme court legalized abortion in its landmark 1973 
decision based on womens right to control her body but in 1981 
it allowed states to impose parentalnotification requirements for 
immature girls still dependent on their parents 
pine said the minnesota case was the nations first in which the 
courts considered a law involving restrictions on minors access to 
abortion that had been enforced 
all other cases before the supreme court and lower courts have 
been challenges brought before the laws took effect pine said 
the others were based on speculation 
pine said a decision whether to appeal the ruling to the us 
supreme court was being considered 
twentyfive states have laws that require minors seeking 
abortions to notify or to obtain consent from at least one parent 
pine said most of them allow minors to seek judicial approval to 
get around the parental notification or consent requirement 
in a dissenting opinion judge donald lay said the majority 
completely ignores the evidence amassed in a fiveweek trial and 
the district courts findings of fact as irrelevant to the 
constitutional issues 
the majority lay said has created a new right apparently of 
constitutional dimension for noncustodial parents to receive 
notice of their minor childrens activities upholding the 
48hour waiting period lay said was contrary to nearly every 
other court decision on this issue

a luxury car jewerly clothes and other items 
maria desillers allegedly purchased with money donated for her 
dying sons liver transplants must be returned today a judge has 
ruled 
dade circuit court judge francis christie on monday gave ms 
desillers until 5 pm to turn over the property which includes a 
bmw automobile with cellular phone more than 11000 in jewelry 
and a cemetery plot next to her sons grave 
christie also said monday he will rule later this week on 
whether to charge ms desillers with contempt for allegedly 
withholding financial information from courtappointed curator 
karen gievers 
when is it all going to end responded ms desillers who 
indicated she would appeal the ruling i lost ronnie i lost it 
all and they still want to keep on punching me 
ms desillers is accused of misusing some of nearly 689000 
donated for her 7yearold sons three unsuccessful operations 
including 1000 from president reagan 
the curator says the return of the items will aid the courts 
efforts to account for the funds even though ms desillers says 
she bought the items with much of her own money 
im really upset about what has happened because i feel it is 
unfair ms desillers said i feel the whole proceedings have 
not focused on what the truth is but is making up what they think 
the truth is 
ms desillers son ronnie died in pittsburghs childrens 
hospital in april 1987 while awaiting his fourth liver transplant 
a 262000 medical bill remains unpaid because ms desillers says 
her son received inadequate medical care 
last month christie ruled ms desillers must give some of the 
remaining 240000 of the donations to groups helping needy and 
sick children 
a computer purchased by desillers was supposed to be used for 
the nowdefunct ronnie desillers national foundation as head of 
the foundation ms desillers paid herself about 88000 in salary 
and other cash payments ms gievers said 
she also gave a total of about 40000 to her brother 
exhusband and exboyfriend ms gievers said 
during this time she did not work or have any other source of 
income on her own ms gievers said it was clear to me that 
all the purchases were made with funds that were donated 
on aug 1 fort lauderdale police concluded ms desillers 
fingerprints do not match those found last year at an elementary 
school where about 4000 in donations for ronnie was reported 
stolen police would not say what information led them to request 
her fingerprints 
leonard robbins an attorney for ms desillers unsuccessfully 
argued that she wanted to keep the cemetery plot so she could be 
buried next to her son 
that hurts the most a tearyeyed ms desillers said after 
the hearing i dont care about anything else

the housekeeper for liberace sobbed as 
she recounted how a doctor told her the entertainer was dying of 
complications from aids then repeated the news in front of him 
dorothy mcmahon said she had not known the source of the 
pianists monthslong illness until liberaces physician ronald 
daniels told her 
he said by law he had to tell me what liberace had and he had 
to tell me in front of liberace she testified in state court 
monday 
ms mcmahon liberaces housekeeper for 16 years liberaces 
sister angie liberace and three others have filed suit in state 
court seeking to have attorney joel strote removed as executor of 
the will and head of the liberace foundation for the performing 
arts which provides scholarships to nearly 30 colleges and 
universities 
ms mcmahon wept loudly as she told of the doctor checking a 
sore on her hand and ordering her to wear gloves when treating the 
entertainer district judge michael wendell ordered a break while 
she regained her composure and the subject was dropped when 
testimony continued 
ms mcmahon said she was informed of the cause of his fatal 
illness jan 22 1987 the day liberace signed a new will making 
strote the executor of his estate the plaintiffs say liberace was 
too ill to comprehend its meaning when the 1987 will was drawn by 
strote 
strote has testified that liberace knew what he was doing when 
the new will was drawn up and signed two weeks before his death on 
feb 4 1987 
ms mcmahon said liberace in his final days could barely walk 
and talk she said she had to bathe liberace and that he was unable 
to walk by himself or to talk with people in the month before his 
death 
the housekeeper challenged testimony by strote that he had 
talked with liberace by phone on jan 21 to review the will 
the 21st was the worst day liberace had she said 
on jan 22 strote came to liberaces palm springs calif home 
to have the will signed and witnessed 
liberace slipped into a coma feb 1 and never regained 
consciousness 
angie and i would lay on top of him to keep him from shaking 
so bad ms mcmahon said

the three weeks of haggling over conditions 
for an iraniraq ceasefire are omens of hard bargaining ahead as 
the war foes plunge into the process of peace after eight years of 
fighting 
diplomats in baghdad say that while a ceasefire may halt the 
shooting fairly soon efforts to keep the guns silent could stretch 
on for years 
it took three weeks for un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar to win agreement on truce conditions after both sides 
finally agreed in principle to a ceasefire 
potential problems lie ahead at nearly every stage of the 
unmandated ceasefire process and in the peace talks that are 
supposed to follow 
un security council resolution 598 calls for both countries to 
withdraw to internationally recognized borders to exchange 
prisoners and for a commission to decide who started the war 
iraq and iran do not agree on their borders some prisoners may 
not want to go home and an inquiry into the wars causes could 
make both sides unhappy 
most serious of all mutual distrust built up by eight years of 
war and threats will make agreements difficult 
i think it will be a long protracted negotiation said a 
european diplomat in baghdad 
the war itself began along two disputed portions of a border 
that arabs persians and their predecessors have contested almost 
since the dawn of civilization 
the two countries remain at odds over the division of the shatt 
alarab waterway that separates southern iraq from iran as it flows 
into the gulf as well as over a sliver of land on the central 
border 
the shatt poses little problem to a ceasefire withdrawal you 
cant stand in the middle of the river one diplomat noted 
but it could be a tangled issue in peace talks according to a 
1975 treaty which called for free navigation the border was set 
in the middle of the waterway before that the border was set on 
the iraqi side giving iran control the 1975 treaty was a victim 
of the war 
diplomats in baghdad said president saddam husseins need to 
demonstrate victory in the war could make iraq stubborn on the 
border question 
iraqis have insisted that any truce immediately open the shatt 
their main outlet to the gulf which was closed soon after iraq 
invaded in force on sept 22 1980 
iraq says the wars first land battles took place on sept 4 and 
7 1980 when iran shelled iraqi cities from the zayn alqaws area 
which iraq claimed under the 1975 treaty 
iraq responded by occupying it on sept 7 this area will be a 
point of dispute in peace talks 
diplomats said snags also lurk in the exchange of prisoners 
according to the international red cross iran held about 50000 
iraqis while iraq had about 13000 iranian captives before recent 
iraqi attacks iraq claims attacks in the past month netted it 
12000 more iranian prisoners 
diplomats say iraqis fear iran may have killed some iraqi 
prisoners a discovery that could endanger peace talks 
a western diplomat cited reports of clashes in iranian camps 
involving iraqi prisoners who had come to support irans ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini some iranians held in iraq have expressed public 
support of saddam 
both have reason to fear a return home 
the un measure calls for a commission to probe responsibility 
for the war a move taken to answer iranian demands that iraq be 
branded the aggressor 
but the composition and tasks given such a group could trigger 
fierce argument especially if the committees decisions affect 
reparations 
the western diplomat said the committee could ask who was 
responsible for provoking initiating and continuing the war 
he noted that iraq could argue that irans threats and shelling 
provoked the war and that iran continued the conflict for years 
after iraq called for a halt a narrower definition might favor 
iran which dates the war to iraqs invasion

fireworks and gunfire pierced the sky in 
the iraqi capital early today and people danced in the streets as 
the government declared victory in its eightyear war against iran 
fireworks cascaded over the tigris river that cuts through the 
city and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition exploded against 
the sky after the postmidnight announcement on iraqi television 
statecontrolled tv and radio called on iraqis to celebrate 
the great victory achieved by iraq on the greatest day of all 
and announced a threeday period of celebration 
the celebrations followed an announcement monday by un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar that a ceasefire would 
begin aug 20 followed by direct talks between iraq and iran 
men danced in the streets of baghdad during the predawn 
celebrations and hornhonking cars loaded with jubilant iraqis 
waving palm and laurel branches drove wildly though the city 
the war is over victory for iraq said a man at the 
entrance to the alrashid hotel as he looked at a sky exploding 
with gunfire 
the war is over praise be to god said a woman beside him 
tracer bullets flares and machinegun fire streamed into the 
sky for hours after the announcement while bangs booms and thuds 
from antiaircraft guns rifles and pistols echoed though the city 
teenagers in tshirts fired off repeated rounds from automatic 
rifles while stranded in a median of a street in the posh mansour 
district by a gridlock of noisy traffic at about 430 am 
jubilant soldiers blocked one of the citys main streets to 
pound on cars and shake hands with passersby 
here take this giddy security men told a reporter in front 
of the alrashid hotel as they thrust a loaded kalashnikov rifle 
toward him 
but instead of handing it to him the guards turned and fired 
the gun into the sky they laughed with men guarding a government 
building across the street one of whom unleashed rounds from a 
machine gun barely pointed in the air 
one car in the hotels parking lot showed a fresh bullet hole in 
its hood 
children scampered about the parking lot and through the city 
streets collecting empty rifle cartridges that clattered from the 
guns 
many iraqis waved flags from car windows and some donned wreaths 
of laurels and sat atop the hoods of speeding sedans flashing 
victory signs at those they passed 
the emotional outpouring was in sharp contrast to the reserve 
with which iraqis greeted irans july 18 announcement that it had 
accepted a ceasefire in principle 
the war has cost the two nations an estimated one million lives 
and by some estimates a total of 400 billion

some say its bigfoot some say its 
only a bear to some the creature described as 7 feet tall with 
red eyes and threefingered hands that quickly became known as the 
lizard man is simply a hoax 
whichever explanation one believes theres no question 
lizardmania has seized this rural commmunity this summer 
it all started when 17yearold christopher davis told police he 
had been attacked by a creature while changing a tire in nearby 
scape ore swamp about 2 am one morning back in june 
the creature he said was more than 7 feet tall was 
blackgreen and grabbed the door of his car running as fast as 35 
mph as he fled 
davis said he swerved along the road before the creature which 
had jumped on his car was thrown off it was strong and it 
wasnt an animal and it wasnt no man he told sheriff liston 
truesdale 
as word of the sighting spread hundreds of outsiders came to 
walk through the swamp west of town a columbia radio station 
offered a 1 million reward and reporters descended on the quiet 
farming community of about 3500 
sheriffs department spokesman billy moore said he has no doubt 
there was something on the road with davis that night 
i believe he saw something what it was i have no earthly 
idea but it wasnt no lizard man he said 
it may have been a bear moore suggested or he said it could 
have been people stopping by an artesian well in the area he said 
locals are known to frequent the well at all hours of the day and 
night 
scape ore swamp got its name in revolutionary war days it was 
near a british encampment and when the americans moved against the 
area the british camp followers escaped into the swamp 
what became known as escaped whore swamp became shortened over 
time to scape ore moore said 
since the sighting however the sheriffs department has 
received dozens of calls from townspeople when their dogs bark at 
night or their farm animals act strangely 
i think most of the people think its a prankster or a joke 
moore said 
youre dealing with a skunk ape which is a colloquial name 
said erik beckjord who has researched the creatures for 10 years 
you can call it anything you want but its a bigfoot 
authorities say there have been hoaxes as lizardmania spread 
deputies made plaster casts of large tracks purportedly made by the 
creature moore said wildlife biologists determined the tracks were 
manmade 
last week an unidentified man reported shooting the thing along 
interstate 20 and gave authorities some scales and blood that 
purportedly came from the creature 
the blood and scales headed for a state crime lab for analysis 
apparently are from a dead fish the sheriff said it doesnt 
take an expert to see what they are 
visitors have been pulling off interstate 20 for the past few 
weeks to satisfy their curiosity about the lizard man 
marina watson of the local chamber of commerce said business has 
been brisk this summer but she had no estimate of how much money 
lizardmania has put into the local economy 
if its lizard man paraphernalia youre after there are hats 
tshirts inflatable toy dinosaurs and even wanted posters with an 
artists impression of the lizard man 
truesdale has had enough he said that when stories like the 
lizard man circulate a lot of people try to get publicity and 
feel important we have enough to do without tracking down things 
like this 
sitting on a counter in the sheriffs department is a can 
labeled as lizarid repellent a can that appears to have nothing 
in it

astronomers searching for radio signals from 
intelligent life beyond the earth say circumstantial evidence is 
growing that humankind is not alone in the universe 
reports of the discovery of new planets and of the presence of 
complex organic chemicals on comets are encouraging michael j 
klein manager of nasas radio search for life said monday 
research announced at the international astronomical unions 
20th assembly last week showed the discovery of at least 10 
planetlike objects in orbit of distant stars other studies showed 
that comets and cosmic dust particles contain the complex organic 
compounds that are thought to have been the chemical precursors of 
life 
that is the circumstantial evidence that life exists 
elsewhere klein said we know now that the materials are 
there it gives us a good feeling that we are on the right track 
klein heads a project called the search for extraterrestrial 
intelligence or seti that is planning to mount an intensified 
search for radio signals from civilizations that may exist on 
planets orbiting distant stars 
programs run by the national aeronautics and space 
administration harvard university and others have listened for 
intelligencedirected radio signals for more than 20 years but 
only a small fraction of the vast universe and the many radio 
frequencies that must be monitored actually have been checked 
the jet propulsion laboratory which is operated by the 
california institute of technology for nasa has proposed expanding 
the effort with sophisticated new equipment that would listen to 
tens of millions of channels at the same time the equipment would 
be monitored by a computer capable of identifying signals that 
could be sent by intelligent life 
klein said the new equipment would be able to look at 1000 
different stars that are thought to be similar to the earths sun 
locations that experts believe hold the best chance for the 
evolution of life 
there also would be whole sky survey in many radio 
frequencies in which every portion of the heavens would be searched 
systematically 
searches in the past have only scratched the surface said 
klein 
the new equipment would be 10 million times more thorough than 
present equipment he said noting in the first few minutes we 
would be able to match all of the searches that were done before 
but even with the new devices the job is immense said frank 
drake chairman of a seti committee of the astronomical union and 
an astronomer at the university of california at santa cruz 
many people think the project should succeed in the next year 
or two he said thats probably not going to happen the 
universe is so huge and the cosmic haystack so large it will take 
us decades 
but drake added the consequences of success are so great that 
its worth dealing with the problems 
the theory behind the seti work is that because there are 
billions of galaxies each with billions of stars the odds are 
good that the conditions that permitted life to evolve on earth 
also exist elsewhere 
if so then intelligent life could have developed along the same 
lines as it did here on earth civilizations that are equal to or 
more advanced than humankind would be sending out signals just as 
occurs on earth the seti project is looking for those signals 
such signals may leak out just as they do on earth drake 
said 
the strongest sign of our existence in the universe is the 
accumulation of our television signals he said the second most 
common radio signal from earth comes from military communications 
klein said the federal budget now under consideration by 
congress includes a 6 million appropriation for the enhanced seti 
equipment he said the total project would last 10 years and cost 
90 million 
if the funding were approved the intensified search could begin 
in 1992 with all of the new equipment operating by 1994

people suffering from genital herpes have 
a legal duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid transmitting the 
disease the state court of appeals ruled today 
a threejudge panel unanimously held that a man may have cause 
for action against his exwife for negligent andor fraudulent 
transmission of genital herpes 
the opinion which identified the man and the woman only by 
initials reversed part of a lower courts summary judgment in 
favor of the woman 
judge marianne short writing for the panel said the case was 
the first time minnesota courts had considered the issue of 
negligent fraudulent or intentional transmission of genital herpes 
or for intentional infliction of emotional distress 
genital herpes a sexually transmitted virus infection is a 
contagious and debilitating disease the court said it is 
extremely painful and often leads to serious physical and 
psychological complications it is presently incurable and is 
spreading at an alarming and dangerous rate 
the court said a reasonable person should know that if he or 
she has a contagious sexually transmissible disease like genital 
herpes the disease is likely to be communicated through sexual 
contact 
thus people suffering from genital herpes generally have a 
duty either to avoid sexual contact with uninfected persons or at 
least to warn potential sex partners that they have herpes before 
sexual contact occurs 
the court rejected an argument by the woman that the recognition 
of a duty to warn was an undue invasion of privacy 
on balance we believe that societys interest in preventing 
the spread of a dangerous incurable disease justified some 
intrusion into personal privacy the court said 
in the case before it the court said there was a factual 
dispute 
the woman contended she told the man she had herpes two weeks 
after she met him while he maintained that she did not tell him 
until after they were married and he had contracted herpes from 
her according to court documents 
the court sent the case back to trial court for resolution of 
that issue and of whether the womans alleged negligence caused the 
man any compensable damage 
it also ordered the trial court to determine whether the man can 
prove the necessary elements of fraud rejecting the womans 
assertion that fraud actions may arise only in business or 
contractual contexts 
the appeals court upheld the lower courts finding that the 
mans allegations that his former wife committed battery by 
deliberately having sexual contact with him knowing that she had 
genital herpes and that she recklessly and intentionally caused 
him emotional distress were barred by a twoyear statute of 
limitations 
it also upheld the trial courts rejection of the mans claims 
for money damages based on his allegation that the woman had 
misrepresented facts about her background and upbringing while 
they were dating

mathematicians gathered here to 
celebrate a century of advances that have benefitted fields ranging 
from medicine to business and have seen american scientists rise to 
the top of the discipline 
when we talk about mathematics generally 100 years ago it was 
a thriving enterprise said ronald douglas 49 dean of physical 
science and mathematics at the university of new york at stony 
brook even so whole new areas have been developed 
douglas was one of about 1300 mathematicians here for a 
weeklong meeting that opened monday to celebrate the centennial 
anniversary of the american mathematical society 
geometricians who lived 100 years ago would not believe how 
large the field has become he said it now interacts with all 
of the sciences with biology with business with medicine with 
economics i think this would surprise people 
the computer alone has allowed mathematicians to solve problems 
today that only existed in theory 20 or 30 years ago he said 
douglas said the advances in mathematics in the united states 
have been remarkable 
mathematics had a small number of american mathematicians 
all of them trained in europe said douglas now american 
mathematics is preeminent in the world having the leadership in 
many areas of mathematics people come from all over the world to 
study here europe is still important but the balance has shifted 
mathematics will continue to move further into medicine and 
biology and new understandings in physics will allow 
mathematicians to develop better machines and computers he said 
the society originally named the new york mathematical society 
was formed in 1888 by a small group of mathematicians it moved its 
headquarters to providence in 1951 
this weeks meeting is one of two the society holds each year in 
conjunction with the mathematical society of america society 
spokeswoman kathleen holmay said 
speakers will address issues ranging from computer graphics to 
the problems of attracting women to the field only about 15 
percent of the societys 21000 members are female ms holmay said 
of the 18 speakers at the conference only one is a woman karen 
k uhlenbeck 46 a mathematics professor at the university of 
texas in austin will speak friday on instantons and their 
relatives instantons are geometric objects discovered by 
physicists

mohammed ali hamadi on trial for 
air piracy and murder in the 1985 twa hijacking on tuesday

who killed the american sailor 
thirtynine americans were held captive for 17 days and us 
navy diver robert stethem was killed during the ordeal which ended 
in beirut 
in the last court session before a summer recess the lebanese 
shiite moslem defendant for the first time acknowledged publicly 
that he was one of the four gunmen who commandeered the 
athenstorome flight 
if this act which i committed is against the law then it is a 
result of illegal conduct on the part of israel hamadi speaking 
in arabic said through an interpreter he made the admission while 
reading from a prepared statement in the heavily guarded courtroom 
hamadi previously has denounced israel for allegedly causing 
problems in his native lebanon and has also condemned the united 
states 
while the united states and west germany had said hamadi was one 
of the four there previously had remained questions about a 
precise identification from photographs taken at the scene 
hamadi told the court he took part in the hijacking in an 
attempt to free shiite moslems held in israeli prisons shortly 
after the june 1985 hijacking ended israel released approximately 
700 shiites 
while hamadi admitted to being one of the hijackers he denied 
shooting stethem and throwing on an airport runway in beirut 
the pistol was in his alleged hijacker hassan izaldins 
hand hamadi said i didnt use it our orders were not to harm 
anyone but i couldnt convince him not to shoot 
stethems parents richard and patricia stethem of waldorf md 
were sitting in the courtroom as hamadi spoke 
i took part in the hijacking hamadi said 
the trial which started in july was to adjourn later tuesday 
until sept 6 when members of the crew of the twa plane are 
scheduled to begin testifying 
hamadi was arrested at frankfurt airport on jan 13 1987 when 
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage 
he has admitted in court to trying to smuggle explosives into 
west germany a third charge raised against him 
the west german government denied us requests to extradite 
hamadi 
hamadis older brother abbas was convicted by a west german 
court in april of masterminding the kidnapping of two west germans 
in beirut in an attempt to force the west german government to free 
mohammed 
abbas was sentenced to 13 years in prison 
one west german alfred schmidt was released in september 1987 
but the second rudolf cordes remains a hostage

move over rock n roll and make room for the 
polka 
while cleveland has been named as future site for the rock n 
roll hall of fame and museum enthusiasts here including mayor 
george voinovich are raising money for a polka hall of fame 
why cleveland 
the base is here the music is here said tony petkovsek 
chairman of the committee organizing the museum cleveland is the 
polka capital of america 
polka king frankie yankovic who in 1986 became the first polka 
artist to win a grammy lives here when hes not on tour with his 
band he is one of an estimated 80000 slovenians living in 
cleveland more than anywhere else in the world outside yugoslavia 
said petkovsek 
polkas have sparked up a bit yankovic 73 said last week 
from his hotel in new orleans where he was playing polkas for the 
fraternal order of eagles convention now disc jockeys are 
playing it and teenagers are starting to try it they cant really 
dance it but they and jump around and have a good time 
the national clevelandstyle polka hall of fame will be in the 
euclid civic center petkovsek said it will document the evolution 
of slovenian folk music into clevelandstyle polka artifacts 
recordings button box accordions and items honoring individuals 
and bands will be on display he said 
there is already a polka hall of fame and museum in chicago 
yankovic was the first polka artist inducted there but the 
chicago museums emphasis is on the polish polka said yankovic 
who has been touring the country for 57 years entertaining crowds 
at county fairs conventions and polka festivals 
petkovsek said clevelands reputation as the polka capital and 
the emphasis on the cleveland style are why the hall is being 
established here 
slovenian is more middleoftheroad polish has more brass 
more of a hop petovsek said bohemian has more brass and 
german is more oom pah pah theyll have tubas baritones and 
trumpets slovenians will have an accordian sax drum bass and 
perhaps a banjo and guitar 
voinovich a museum committee member said he first danced the 
polka as a boy and later as a member of the ohio house of 
representatives in 1967 introduced legislation designating 
cleveland as polka capital of the world 
from a cultural national standpoint the polka has brought a 
tremendous amount of enjoyment to millions of americans 
voinovich said 
cleveland once had a weekly television show polka varieties 
petkovsek has been host of a daily polka radio hour for 27 years 
in fact petkovsek has built his livelihood on a business 
centered on the polka 
tonys polka village where petkovsek broadcasts his radio show 
sells records and tapes from what he describes as the largest 
collection of polka music in the world petkovsek is partner in a 
travel agency that conducts polka tours around the world 
petkovsek said he has taken up to 400 members of polka bands on 
tours to europe south america and australia band members bring 
their instruments and play at taverns and listen to local polka

looking for lions and tigers and other big 
animals not in the new central park zoo 
the zoo which officially opened amid much fanfare monday 
instead has a more eclectic offering the golfodulcean dart poison 
frog the tufted puffin the plumbeous water redstart thats a 
bird folks 
it doesnt seem like a zoo to me it doesnt have any 
elephants or any giraffes complained daniella alonzo 10 one of 
the first visitors to the 30 million renovation who nevertheless 
said the zoo was nice 
there are 450 animals from more than 100 species unlike the old 
zoo the new zoo has no large animals because of space 
this is a minizoo to show things likely to arouse peoples 
interest and a sense of caring said dr william g conway 
general director of the new york zoological society which runs the 
zoo for the city parks department 
a 4blocklong line snaked through the park within an hour of 
the opening as the new attractions housed in three different 
habitats drew 13701 firstday visitors most didnt share 
daniellas disappointment 
these animals know how to act theyre not like people who 
have to learn how to act said 11yearold patricia benitez who 
toured the tropic zone habitat with classmates from her manhattan 
day camp 
monkeys bats fish and frogs were featured there the polar 
circle is home to polar bears penguins and arctic foxes the 
temperate territory is home to otters red pandas turtles and sea 
lions 
mayor edward i koch cut the ribbon to officially open the new 
zoo before playing straight man to a frisky sea lion named finn 
finn circling in the newly renovated sea lion tank in the 
middle of the park waved to koch waved to the visitors caught 
fish tossed by the mayor and barked on request 
the renovation was supposed to cost 28 million but came in at 
about 30 million partly because work took several months longer 
than anticipated parks commissioner henry stern said construction 
began in april 1985 
the commissioner was enthusiastic over the results the other 
zoo was like a singsing for animals said stern referring to 
the zoo that was shut down in the winter of 1983 so weve built 
a humane zoo a zoo for the 1990s 
there was one other new feature visitors who once toured for 
free now pay 1 senior citizens pay 50 cents while kids come 
through for a quarter 
when i learned they were charging i insisted the zoo has got 
to cost less than an ice cream cone if you can find an ice cream 
cone for less id like to see it said stern times have 
changed

north korea called today for urgent 
parliamentary talks on its demand to cohost the olympic games and 
rejected south koreas proposal for preliminary negotiations 
the communist north said it would agree to a meeting aug 17 to 
handle logistical arrangements for interparliamentary talks on the 
olympics and a nonaggression pact but it rejected a south korean 
call for detailed preliminary talks on working out an agenda for 
fullscale negotiations 
time is too short to take the form of holding a preliminary 
contact and then the full talks under the present condition where 
40 days are left until the opening of the olympic games that 
must be debated as an urgent agenda item the letter said 
the olympic games start sept 17 in seoul and north korea has 
said it will boycott unless it can cohost the event 
the letter from yang hyong sop chairman of the norths 
rubberstamp supreme peoples assembly said the body wants the 
first full meeting of both parliaments to be held in its capital of 
pyongyang 
it was addressed to south korean national assembly speaker kim 
chaesun 
the tough north korean letter delivered at the border truce 
site of panmunjom said just three to five delegates from each side 
should attend the aug 17 meeting rather than the 15member 
delegations proposed by seoul 
south korea which had tentatively accepted a north korean call 
last month for legislative talks on the olympics and a 
nonaggression pact wants detailed preliminary talks to set an 
agenda it called for the preliminary negotiations this week 
south korean officials believe contacts with the north reduce 
potential threats to the olympics and they indicate privately the 
hope of keeping pyongyang talking until after the games 
north korea on the other hand still hopes to force seoul to 
agree to cohosting if it cannot cohost the games observers say 
the north needs an excuse and the failure of nonaggression talks 
might enable it to blame the south 
most observers believe there is little chance of north korea 
dropping its cohosting demand and taking part in the olympics 
such a change would represent a total turnabout after 40 years of 
bitter rivalry for supremacy between the two sides 
the north invaded the south in 1950 to start the korean war and 
the two sides technically remain at war since no peace treaty was 
signed when an armistice halted fighting in 1953

four young adults whose bodies were 
found huddled in a tiny dental storage room died apparently from 
asphyxiation after the inhaled laughing gas authorities said 
the bodies were found monday near an open empty tank of 
laughing gas authorities said 
the bodies were taken to the state medical examiners office for 
autopsy but iron county attorney scott burns said preliminary 
investigation showed they were asphyxiated after apparently 
inhaling the colorless anesthetic nitrous oxide 
its just a tragic accident and our hearts go out to the 
families he said weve never had injuries or deaths due to 
nitrous oxide 
but he said its common throughout the united states for 
people to try to gain access to that nitrous oxide to try to get 
high 
he identified the victims as owen marc gregerson 18 and shawn 
williams 19 both of cedar city christine cherie miller 20 
fillmore and margaret j probert 20 scipio 
the 6by6foot storage room was adjacent to gregersons 
fathers dental clinic 
burns and police chief pete hansen said there was no sign of 
forced entry and a key was found in a jacket outside the storeroom 
it appeared they let themselves into the storage area late 
sunday or early monday and turned on the gas which was in a large 
tank similar to a welding tank the officials said 
there is no suspicion of suicide or foul play hansen said 
the bodies were found by an employee who had gone to the 
storeroom to get a cannister of gas and described a tangle of 
bodies a gruesome scene hansen said 
authorities described the victims as cleancut youths with no 
history of illegal activity or drug use

the crowded skies above ohare international 
airport and basic errors by its air traffic controllers have 
prompted federal aviation officials to scrutinize operations at the 
worlds secondbusiest airport 
the national transportation safety board on monday called for a 
backtobasics training program for traffic controllers at 
ohare to counter an unusually high number of controller errors 
federal aviation administration officials say they also plan a 
broad review of operations at ohare 
after a special investigation the ntsb recommended that 
controllers at ohare be provided with new and better equipment and 
that the faa find ways to increase controller staffing reduce peak 
traffic loads improve training and develop better quality 
assurance 
the faa declined to comment directly on the recommendations but 
said it plans its own review of ohare by a team of agency and 
industry experts with a report to be submitted to faa 
administrator allan mcartor by sept 20 
faa spokesman fred farrar said in washington dc the review 
will go beyond air traffic control questions and will include an 
examination of the airports overall operation 
more than 50 organizations have been invited to participate in 
the review including representatives from the airlines pilots 
union various aviation organizations and the city of chicago 
farrar said 
a spokesman for airline pilots said safety concerns arent 
unique to ohare 
the thing to focus on is that we have overcrowded skies and an 
insufficient number of controllers said capt james damron a 
spokesman for the air line pilots association in chicago 
we recognize the problems he said we are supportive and 
optimistic about our collective ability to produce some 
suggestions 
damron blamed the troubles on the firing of striking air traffic 
controllers by president reagan in august 1981 some have been 
hired back but not enough to keep up with the growing demand 
damron said 
there have not been enough applicants and they have not been 
able to produce enough controllers damron said 
ohare airport handles an average of nearly 2200 takeoffs and 
landings a day its 796939 arrivals and departures last year were 
second only to atlantas hartsfield international 
last year ohare handled more than 56 million passengers more 
than any other airport but the airport has been the subject of 
numerous investigations by the faa the ntsb and congressional 
committees because of safety concerns 
the latest ntsb investigation was prompted by reports in june 
that controllers had committed 19 operational errors where aircraft 
had been allowed to fly dangerously close to one another seven 
more than during all of 1987 
after examining these incidents ntsb investigators concluded 
that in many cases controllers failed to follow procedures and in a 
majority of the cases the errors involved a breakdown in basic 
air traffic control skills 
the safety board said that in many cases the controllers 
performance was affected by excessive workload lack of 
attentiveness forgetting perceptual problems fatigue and 
excessive time on position without a break 
the board said it was concerned that these controllers 
working at one of the nations busiest terminal radar facilities 
failed to act in accordance with basic controller standards and 
principles and it questioned the effectiveness of the faas 
overall quality control program 
the ntsb also said it was concerned about excessive overtime 
among controllers shortages of controllers and the need for better 
equipment

as dawn breaks over the persian gulf on 
aug 20 iran and iraqs guns are to fall silent after eight years 
of war that have claimed the lives of up to 1 million people 
peace talks to end the deadly conflict will begin five days 
later in geneva 
the restoration of peace will bring to the peoples of both 
countries victories far greater than those of war 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said monday in announcing 
the truce 
the security council meets today to authorize a 350man unarmed 
un peacekeeping force to monitor a ceasefire and troop 
withdrawals 
i have been assured by the two parties to the conflict that 
they will observe this ceasefire in the context of the full 
implementation of resolution 598 the security councils 
comprehensive peace plan said perez de cuellar 
the governments of the islamic republic of iran and the 
republic of iraq have also agreed to the deployment of united 
nations observers as of the time and date of the ceasefire 
perez de cuellar did not announce dates for a troop withdrawal 
prisoner exchange or other elements of the yearold un peace plan 
the populations and economies of both iran and iraq have been 
exhausted by a war fought with modern weapons but with tactics that 
harked back to the most brutal campaigns of world war i setpiece 
battles trench warfare mustard gas attacks human wave assaults 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati of iran told reporters on 
monday i wish to declare my government is prepared to accept the 
demand of the secretarygeneral and that of the entire world 
community to refrain from any military action on land sea and air 
starting today 
let me express my sincere hope that todays historic 
announcement will be the first step in the implementation of all 
provisions of resolution 598 and the achievement of a just 
comprehensive and honorable setttlement returning peace and 
stability to all the region he added 
ambassador ismat kittani of iraq told reporters now we begin 
the arduous but happy march that begins from here i am sure it 
will not be a smooth road but it will be much more pleasant than 
fighting and bloodshed 
the ceasefire agreement was announced after a weekend of 
feverish negotiations in which iraq gave up its demand for 
facetoface talks with iran as a precondition to a truce 
on july 18 iran abandoned its longstanding insistence that iraq 
be branded the aggressor in the war as a first step toward peace 
ending a yearlong stalemate in peace efforts 
one provision of resolution 598 will establish an impartial 
commission to judge responsibility for the conflict and velayati 
made it clear iran hopes this commission will blame iraq for 
starting it 
war broke out in september 1980 when iraq invaded iran after a 
series of clashes along the shattalarab waterway that separates 
them the waterway is iraqs only outlet to the gulf 
on monday the secretarygenerals office released a report 
saying the gulf peacekeeping mission may include a small naval 
patrol for the waterway the first time the united nations has 
planned to commission a fleet 
the report estimates the cost of the unarmed peacekeeping force 
at 74 million for the first six months of which 47 million would 
be startup costs the united nations will assess its 159 members 
for the cost of the mission 
un spokesman francois giuliani said monday that about 25 
nations would send officers to the force to be called the un 
iraniraq military observer group 
he declined to name the countries but said it was unlikely that 
any of the permanent security council members the united states 
soviet union britain france or china would send troops 
if the ceasefire plan takes hold as diplomats and observers 
believe it will it will be the united nations second major 
peacekeeping success this year 
in april pakistan and afghanistans promoscow regime signed a 
peace accord in geneva for the withdrawal of more than 100000 
soviet troops from afghanistan

israeli warplanes today blasted a 
guerrilla base and a plorun radio station knocking it off the 
air police said at least three guerrillas were killed and 12 
wounded in the attack near this southern port city 
a police spokesman said six israeli warplanes fired 26 missiles 
in 14 attacks on a building housing offices and studios of the 
voice of palestine radio and an adjacent guerrilla base southeast 
of sidon 
he said the twohour israeli attack the longest in lebanon this 
year began at 10 am the three people killed were at the 
guerrilla base police said 
the police spokesman said most of the missiles hit the ground 
floor of the radio station building 
an israeli army spokesman in jerusalem confirmed the raid he 
said the station was used to broadcast instructions to palestinians 
in the israelioccupied territories where unrest has claimed more 
than 200 lives since december 
the base in southeast lebanon was a radio station used for 
propaganda and incitement broadcasts and to pass orders for 
executing terror attacks he said he spoke on condition of 
anonymity in keeping with military regulations 
all the planes returned safely he said 
the police spokesman who also spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the ground floor which is the only visible part of the vop 
building was totally demolished by the first four missiles 
it seems that the israelis are trying also to demolish the 
three underground floors of the radio 
palls of thick black smoke billowed from the building and the 
nearby base about a half mile south of the mieh mieh palestinian 
refugee camp on sidons southeastern edge 
rescuers in a dozen ambulances and fire engines arrived at the 
stricken building a half hour after the raid ended and dug into 
vops three underground floors to rescue anyone who might be 
trapped the spokesman said 
the radio station according to the police spokesman was 
founded early in june and beamed special programs to the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
the palestine liberation organization in a statement blared by 
loudspeaker vans called for urgent blood donations at mieh mieh 
and the nearby camp of ein elhilweh 
the police spokesman said the raiding jets fired scarlet 
balloons to deflect heatseeking shoulderheld missiles fired by 
palestinian guerrillas 
witnesses in sidon 25 miles south of beirut said guerrilla 
defenders firing their antiaircraft guns missed the raiding jets 
one witness speaking on condition of anonymity said motorists 
deserted their vehicles and sought refuge in orange and banana 
groves as the israeli warplanes roared overhead 
he said air raid sirens wailed in sidon the provincial capital 
of south lebanon during the attack shopkeepers lowered their 
shutters and several people deserted businesses and took cover in 
basements and bomb shelters 
it was the 12th israeli air attack in lebanon this year by 
police count 62 people were killed and 81 wounded in the previous 
11 raids

irans commanderinchief said today his 
country would not initiate any more military actions against iraq 
but told soldiers to maintain their vigil against possible enemy 
attacks 
the armed forces should not from today be the initiators of 
any kind of military and armed moves said hashemi rafsanjani 
acting commander of the iranian forces and also speaker of 
parliament 
but just like always iran will be ready to give an 
appropriate response to the mischiefs of the enemy he said in a 
statement broadcast on official tehran radio 
only at 7 am today by way of tehran radio did most iranians 
learn a ceasefire is to take effect aug 20 in their 8yearold 
war with iraq the announcement monday at the united nations in new 
york came too late for the main morning newspaper jomhuri islami 
iranians greeted the announcement with a sense of relief mixed 
with skepticism that it will mean lasting peace 
i heard it on the bbc british broadcasting corp much 
earlier said a middleaged man who declined to give his name 
sure its good but i hope that there will not be years of 
discussions like the talks that have been going on for so many 
years about peace between the arabs and israel 
hopefully it means peace said a hotel employee in the laleh 
hotel but celebrating after so many martyrs 
a man who introduced himself as a telephone operator was smiling 
broadly i just learned it 10 minutes ago sure i will celebrate 
tonight with my family i will have a bottle of coke you know 
there is no drinking in our country 
a driver who said he formerly held a wellpaid job in 
construction told a visitor my son romin has sent a message 
that he is coming home in four weeks now that the fighting ends he 
has been in the army for two years and eight months luckily he has 
not been wounded the place where is he is now is pretty quiet 
a 25yearold named fahrad said he was excused from military 
service because of injuries he suffered in a car accident while 
studying petrochemical engineering in los angeles 
many of my generation are dead he said in a way i was 
lucky to have been in that accident 
a western diplomat said expectations had been running high among 
tehran residents but they will be disappointed normalization 
will take much time he spoke on condition of anonymity 
european diplomatic sources also speaking on condition of 
anonymity said both sides seemed interested in restoring relations 
but that process would take some time there is a lot of 
emotional debris to be cleared away on both sides one analyst 
said 
an associated press reporter requested permission to visit 
frontline troops preparing for the truce but a ministry of 
islamic guidance official said it was not possible 
a request to visit tehrans war cemetery brought the same answer 
an editorial in the englishlanguage tehran times pointed to the 
issues that have to be solved in direct talks that begin in geneva 
aug 25 before the neighbors can have comprehensive peace 
what follows is really going to be crucial the editorial 
said all negotiations now intended to be held under the aegis of 
the un secretarygeneral will undoubtedly have to take the 
algiers accord as a reference point 
the algiers accord which iran and iraq signed in 1975 was an 
attempt to settle outstanding border disputes especially over 
access to the shattalarab waterway the delta of the tigris and 
euphrates rivers is iraqs only outlet to the sea and the accords 
set the border in the middle of the waterway 
it has to be remembered that the iraqi leader president 
saddam hussein did not have the slightest hesitation in tearing up 
this agreement quite openly in a fit of pique at the inception of 
the war the newspaper said

democrat michael dukakis today praised the 
reagan administration as growing but accused vice president 
george bush of avoiding public stances on major foreign policy 
issues 
i dont think bushs positions are clear on much of 
anything dukakis declared 
he asserted that president reagan has moved closer to dukakis 
own positions on crucial issues such as relations with the soviet 
union while bush has not dukakis cited the persian gulf the 
regional conflict in southern africa and the strategic arms 
reduction talks 
its an administration thats growing frankly theyre 
coming a lot closer to where i am on such issues dukakis said 
the inf intermediate nuclear forces treaty and reagans 
approach to the summit demonstrate a willingness on his part to 
explore closer relations with the soviet union its to his credit 
heres an administration that five years ago was talking evil 
empire he said referring to the words reagan once used to 
describe the soviets and now the president is walking arminarm 
with gorbachev in red square 
dukakis made the comments to reporters aboard his chartered 
campaign jet as he flew to cincinnati where he was participating 
in the final day of meetings of the national governors 
association the democratic presidential nominee is in his third 
term as governor of massachusetts 
while dukakis offered some praise for reagan on foreignpolicy 
issues he leveled a new blast at bush the vice president and 
expected gop presidential nominee on those same issues he said 
bushs foreignpolicy positions were unclear on all but this 
endless fiasco in central america where bush supports aid to the 
contra rebels in nicaragua and dukakis opposes it 
i dont know do you know where he stands dukakis said to 
reporters i dont think anybody knows where he is on these 
things the only thing hes done is to express some doubt on 
ussoviet relations 
dukakis attended to his governors office duties monday but at 
a statehouse news conference he faced repeated questioning about 
bushs renewed assault in which the vice president described him as 
a stealth candidate who has ignored issues and concealed his 
liberalism 
i think the way im going to win the presidency is not by 
responding every day to what some speechwriter has put in front of 
mr bush dukakis said its going to be by defining myself my 
party my values this country its future and the kind of society 
i think all americans want 
but pressed by reporters dukakis offered a response anyway 
george bush has some of the highest negatives ever recorded in 
the history of american politics and i think one of the reasons 
for it is people have seen his campaign as an essentially negative 
campaign dukakis said 
dukakis who has enjoyed big leads in recent polls said voters 
were looking for positive expressions of what a candidate planned 
to do as president and suggested bush has not been doing that 
i dont think theyre interested in a daily diet of this kind 
of thing and its one of the reasons at least at this point the 
republican campaign seems to be in trouble he said 
dukakis planned to campaign in northeastern states thursday and 
friday before spending the weekend vacationing on cape cod with his 
wife kitty 
the campaign was preparing for next weeks republican national 
convention in new orleans where dukakis is expected to be the 
object of criticism and derision dukakis aides were suggesting 
they expected to see much of dukakis doubledigit lead over bush 
in recent polls evaporate in the week of republican exposure 
but dukakis following the lead of bush planned to head out on 
a fourday campaign swing nex week beginning wednesday the third 
day of the gop convention bush broke with the tradition of not 
campaigning during the rivals convention week by venturing out 
during the democratic convention three weeks ago 
at his news conference dukakis recalled an 8yearold blast 
that bush leveled at ronald reagan before bush joined reagan on 
the 1980 gop ticket as the governors response to bushs charge he 
lacked foreign policy experience 
he made the same comment about the republican candidate for 
the presidency in 1980 and hes now trying to succeed him so what 
can i say dukakis said 
his aides distributed copies of a 1980 newspaper story that 
quoted bush as saying of reagan we cannot take a chance on 
another president who has absolutely no experience in foreign 
affairs

and was under control by 240 am 
no injuries were reported in the fire that caused an estimated

after two ingots of magnesium apparently were placed too close 
together but the exact cause of the blaze is still under 
investigation she said

caused some small explosions she added

three hundred residents of this tiny 
northeast georgia community were forced to spend the night away 
from home after chemical tankers fractured in a train derailment 
spilled an industrial solvent 
about 20 people were treated briefly at a hospital monday after 
they inhaled the slightly toxic fumes from the spilled solvent a 
highly flammable liquid called xylene that is used in aviation fuel 
and as a solvent for resins enamels and lacquers 
an estimated 61 cars in a 95car csx freight train derailed at 
about 130 pm monday near the tracks intersection with georgia 
72 in middleton a rural community four miles southeast of elberton 
seven of the derailed cars were carrying hazardous materials and 
at least three of those cars were leaking said csx transportation 
inc spokesman ripley watson 
the damaged tankers were spilling their contents into a cow 
pasture said elbert county sheriffs lt charles dooley 
emergency personnel evacuated about 300 residents within about 
two miles of the derailment dooley said the evacuees were brought 
to elberton civic center where volunteers helped them find shelter 
at local motels or at the homes of family and friends in the area 
authorities built a dike using booms supplied by the coast 
guard to keep the pool of liquid xylene from flowing into nearby 
beaver dam creek which forms the headwaters for lake russell said 
lucy justus spokeswoman for the state environmental protection 
division 
the liquid probably would be allowed to soak into the dirt and 
the contaminated soil would be dug up and removed to a hazardous 
waste landfill she said 
watson said railroad workers expected to clear the tracks by 
thursday 
the 95car train which was headed to hamlet nc from 
atlanta also carried coal pulpboard lumber soybean meal and a 
number of truck trailers watson said 
he said the train was going about 35 mph when it derailed there 
was no immediate indication of what caused the derailment

nationwide state of emergency to cope with the countrys worst 
floods in 42 years which have left more than 1 million sudanese 
homeless cairo newspapers said today 
sudans capital khartoum was almost completely paralyzed for 
the third straight day from power and water supply cutoffs caused 
by floods that followed torrential rains last week the leading 
stateowned alahram said 
prime minister sadek elmahdi announced on state television 
monday night that a sixmonth state of emergency was in effect to 
help his government cope with the destruction 
in nairobi kenya ambassador omer elsheikh of sudan told the 
associated press that millions of people have been stranded by 
floods in eastern sudan 
elsheikh said more than 10000 houses were destroyed in 
khartoum alone double the official figure given in the capital 
sunday and that he expected the number to increase 
in london a spokesman for the foreign office who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said he had received reports of 11 dead 
some 100 injured and 15 million people left homeless he said he 
had no independent confirmation of the figures 
alahram and algomhouria another egyptian stateowned 
newspaper said at least 11 people died some electrocuted by 
smashed power cables falling into flood waters 
on sunday the sudanese government declared khartoum and three 
other cities disaster areas and appealed for international help 
the newspapers said that in khartoum the public transport 
system collapsed universities and schools were shut and some of 
the capitals nearly 4 million inhabitants faced starvation after 
bakeries closed and food supplies dwindled 
the stateofemergency decree enables the government to ban 
strikes and demonstrations make arrests without warrants tap

of the war against rebels in the south and the deteriorating 
economy

democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis joined fellow governors today as they were told the next 
president will have a limited amount of time to make the tough 
choices needed to deal with the federal budget deficit 
dukakis took his seat at a corner of the square table at which 
the nations governors sat for the closing session of the 80th 
annual meeting of the national governors association 
the governors first order of business at the session was to 
hear from former reagan administration cabinet official drew lewis 
and rep leon panetta dcalif cochairmen of the national 
economic commission a panel established to recommend ways to deal 
with the deficit 
that commission is not going to come up with any magic 
answers but it can provide important political cover for the next 
president said panetta 
the california congressman said the next president would face 
difficult choices on such questions as the level of defense 
spending whether to cut programs that include automatic benefit 
increases and whether to ask for a tax increase 
dukakis said nothing during that opening discussion 
governor of massachusetts for 10 years dukakis attended the 
meeting the day after the governors warmly applauded president 
reagan when he told them that during his two terms in the white 
house the states had gained far more flexibility and power to deal 
with domestic problems 
no longer just one of 50 state governors seated around the 
conference table dukakis also was meeting with democratic 
governors for a closed session on strategy for his campaign against 
republican george bush 
he will ask the governors to speak out on his behalf said 
campaign spokesman leslie dach who added that dukakis believes his 
record as a governor is one of his greatest strengths 
before reagan spoke to the governors monday he stopped at a 
local plant and told workers that some people were campaigning 
on the idea that its time for a change take a chance on us 
but you cant unplug our progrowth economic policies and 
expect things to stay the same he said 
in that speech and in his later talk to the governors reagan 
cited the number of jobs created during his tenure as well as 
lower unemployment in general and reduced taxes 
reagans theme was picked up by gov george deukmejian of 
california who said vice president bush would carry the nations 
largest state despite current polls there giving dukakis a 
doubledigit lead over bush 
why would the people want to risk a change in going to a total 
unknown person an unknown administration asked deukmejian 
as governor of a state with 47 electoral votes nearly onefifth 
of the 270 needed for election deukmejian was mentioned often as a 
potential running mate for bush but the governor took himself out 
of contention for that spot in a letter last week to the vice 
president 
turning to another likely gop campaign theme deukmejian said 
that after the democratic convention in atlanta last month the 
democratic party has been jacksonized a reference to the 
prominent role given to jesse jackson 
deukmejian predicted jackson would want to continue to be in 
the limelight and that governor dukakis is going to have his 
hands full with mr jackson between now and election day 
but while deukmejian described dukakis as unknown fellow 
republican gov thomas kean of new jersey said bush suffers from 
the same problem 
one thing our polls show is that people dont know what he 
bush has done before becoming vice president and people are 
confused about his views on the issues said kean a supporter of 
bush and keynote speaker at the republican convention next week 
dach said that in the course of the long presidential campaign 
people have gotten to know dukakis and polls show they are inclined 
to support him 
by contrast said dach the polls show that people know george 
bush and they dont like him

mohammed ali hamadi admitted in 
court today to being one of four men who hijacked a twa jetliner to 
beirut in 1985 but denied killing a us navy diver during the 
ordeal 
i took part in the hijacking the lebanese shiite moslem 
said reading from a statement in the heavily guarded courtroom 
if this act which i committed is against the law then it is a 
result of illegal conduct on the part of israel hamadi speaking 
in arabic said through an interpreter 
thirtynine americans were held captive for 17 days after twa 
flight 847 was hijacked on an athenstorome flight navy diver 
robert stethem was beaten and fatally shot and his body thrown onto 
a beirut airport runway 
under west german law hamadi still can be convicted of murder 
even if he did not actually pull the trigger he faces a maximum of 
life in prison 
hamadi on trial for air piracy and murder said he hijacked a 
us aircraft because the united states is the greatest ally and 
supporter of israel 
cleanshave and waring an openneck creamcolored shirt hamadi 
read calmly and clearly from the statement 
he said the goal of the june 1985 hijacking was to gain freedom 
for shiite imprisoned in israel 
the decision to hijack the plane came after everything else 
failed hamadi said in 45minute presentation there was no 
other way to free the prisoners other than the means chosen 
shortly after the june 1985 hijacking ended israel released 
approximately 700 lebanese 
in reflecting on the hijacking hamadi told the court i am 
not ready to do something like that again 
as i took part in the action that happened out of the belief 
that there was no other way to get the release of those imprisoned 
now im of the opinion that thats not the case 
the trial which started in july was adjourned until sept 6 
when members of the crew of the twa plane were to begin testifying 
until today the only testimony that hamadi was involved in the 
hijacking came from two witnesses who testified that hamadis older 
brother abbas had told them as much 
hamadi told the court that one of the three alleged hijackers 
still at large hassan izzaldin was in charge of the hijacking 
and had shot stethem 
the pistol was in his izzaldins hand hamadi said i 
didnt use it our orders were not to harm anyone but i couldnt 
convince him not to shoot 
stethems parents richard and patricia stethem of waldorf md 
were in the courtroom as hamadi spoke 
when hamadi finished chief judge heiner mueckenberger said the 
testimony was surprising for everybody it marks a certain turn 
in the trial 
it was an intelligent presentation of your point of view he 
added saying the court would have to reconsider the future course 
of the trial 
hamadi was arrested at frankfurt airport on jan 13 1987 when 
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage 
the united states sought his extradition but west germany 
turned down the request after two west german businessmen were 
abducted in beirut 
abbas hamadi was sentenced to 13 years in prison after he was 
convicted by a west german court in april of masterminding the 
kidnappings in an attempt to force west germany to free mohammed 
one of the abducted men alfred schmidt was released in 
september 1987 the other rudolf cordes remains a hostage and is 
believed held by hezbollah a proiranian shiite group in lebanon 
a third hamadi brother abdulhadi is hezbollahs security 
chief in beirut mohammed hamadi has denied being a member of 
hezbollah

bullets bombs rocks and other missiles protesters hijacked cars 
erected barricades across streets and lighted dozens of bonfires

including a crowd of several hundred throwing gasoline bombs at 
police outside a bus station on at least one occasion police 
opened fire with live ammunition

the interstate commerce commission today 
unanimously approved the sale of the southern pacific railroad to 
rio grande industries creating a 15000mile rail system that 
covers 15 states from portland ore to new orleans 
rio grande industries has agreed to buy the southern pacific 
from santa fe southern pacific corp for 12 billion 
the icc in a 40 vote said the merger of the southern pacific 
and the denver amp rio grande western railroads would have the best 
competitive results and be in the public interest 
the commission last year ordered the santa fe southern pacific 
corp to divest itself of the southern pacific after the rejection 
of that railroads merger with the santa fe 
santa fe southern reached agreement with rio grande industries 
but when permission for the sale was sought from the icc another 
railroad company kansas city southern industries objected and 
sought to buy southern pacific as well 
but the icc in a series of votes today turned its back on the 
kansas city southern proposal and approved the sale to rio grande 
industries instead 
at a news conference philip anschutz chairman of rio grande 
industries applauded the icc decision and said the combined 
railroads will operate under the banner of southern pacific 
he said that senior officers of the southern pacific will be 
announced before the purchase is completed and that managers will 
be drawn from the ranks of both railroads 
the southern pacific also has extensive real estate holdings in 
the west but anschutz said we will be in the railroad business 
first and foremost 
the southern pacific operates up and down the west coast and 
along the southern tier of the country with tracks stretching from 
portland ore through central california through el paso texas 
and as far east as new orleans it also operates from st louis to 
the gulf coast 
the denver amp rio grande runs along a central corridor from 
ogden utah to st louis 
kansas city southern could challenge the icc ruling in court but 
the companys president and chief executive officer landon 
rowland said no decision has been made on what the next step if 
any would be 
were not ruling out anything i dont know what our 
options are rowland told reporters after the icc vote

from rangoon put casualties in todays demonstrations in the 
hundreds but said it would take time for information to be 
sorted out

where demonstrations were held today it also said schools 
throughout the country including elementary schools were closed

machine guns at shwedagon pagoda a site of antigovernment 
protests

and roadblocks were manned by soldiers on a drive from mandalay to 
rangoon he said he saw six armored cars and up to 20 trucks loaded 
with troops heading for the capital 
they appeared nervous but ready for some sort of trouble he 
said 
the demonstrations are by far the largest show of 
antigovernment sentiment since democracy was toppled in the 
southeast asian nation in 1962 
this is a tragedy our reports say the crowds have been very 
conciliatory towards the security forces one diplomat said 
today things are going from bad to worse 
radio rangoon reported mass demonstrations monday in areas 
ranging from moulmein on the southern coast to taunggyi in the 
mountainous area of the shan states it said security forces killed

party last month and soon after ordered the arrests of the most 
outspoken critic of the authoritarian government former brig gen 
aung gyi other dissidents and associated press correspondent sein

annual per capita income of less than 200 since the fall there 
have been antigovernment demonstrations in virtually every city 
and town 
in bangkok and hong kong burmese consular officials said they 
had been ordered by rangoon to indefinitely stop issuing tourist 
visas to burma but the consulate in tokyo said it was continuing 
to process them officials said businessmen could still apply for

democrat michael dukakis fired a return salvo at george bush 
today grabbing a central attack theme from the republican 
nomineetobe and charging i dont think bushs positions are 
clear on much of anything 
bush has hit dukakis in recent days with a barrage of criticism 
saying the massachusetts governor is inexperienced in foreign 
policy and waffles on the issues on monday he set the tone for 
next weeks republican national convention taking advantage of a 
rare appearance for a nominee at platform hearings to light into 
dukakis 
hes the stealth candidate bush said while he cant 
decide about the stealth bomber he favors instead stealth policies 
they can be neither seen nor heard 
dukakis supports research and development for the supersecret 
bomber but has not vowed to support deployment 
as bush got off one of his better lines sen phil gramm of 
texas said he wouldnt stoop to using some cutesypoo name to 
attack dukakis during his nominating speech for bush 
im not going to demean the office by trying to think up some 
cute name that i can call him that somebody might laugh at gramm 
said referring to wisecracking speeches that texans ann richards 
and jim hightower made at the democratic national convention 
bush stayed away from direct attacks on dukakis today painting 
himself instead as tough on crime and touting his opposition to the 
american civil liberties union 
there are those like the aclu whose first concerns are the 
protection of the criminals rights and the potential abuse of 
power by police bush told a police group in erie pa my first 
concerns are the protection of lawabiding citizens and the abuse 
of our system of constitutional protections by thugs who can go and 
hire smart lawyers and find the right judges to set them free 
and the republican vice president said liberals in congress just 
duck the tough issue of drug enforcement congress is full of 
rhetorical heroes on the issue of drugs but when it comes to law 
enforcement a lot of the liberals there go awol 
the democratic nominee lashed back at bush as he flew from 
boston to cincinnati to join the final session of the national 
governors association 
bushs foreignpolicy positions were unclear dukakis said with 
the sole exception of this endless fiasco in central america 
where bush supports aid to the contra rebels in nicaragua and 
dukakis opposes it 
i dont know do you know where he stands dukakis said to 
reporters i dont think anybody knows where he is on these 
things the only thing hes done is to express some doubt on 
ussoviet relationsi dont think bushs positions are clear 
on much of anything 
dukakis did offer some praise for reagan administration 
policies saying relations with the soviet union have improved for 
example 
its an administration thats growing he commented 
on monday in cincinnati the governors heard a farewell speech 
from president reagan with the gop incumbent staying away from the 
campaign specifics but boasting of the accomplishments of his 
administration 
our states like our citizens have known the blessings of the 
longest peacetime economic expansion on record reagan said 
in the convention city politics took a back seat to the weather 
as tropical storm beryl pounded away on the region the storm 
stalled off the coast with strong winds blowing heavy rain through 
the city 
dukakis was weary of the constant pounding from bush whom he 
leads by doubledigit margins in the national polls on the fall 
election and he said the public is getting tired of it as well 
i dont think theyre interested in a daily diet of this kind 
of thing and its one of the reasons at least at this point the 
republican campaign seems to be in trouble dukakis said in 
boston 
at first the massachusetts governor said he would not respond 
to bush 
i think the way im going to win the presidency is not by 
responding every day to what some speechwriter has put in front of 
mr bush dukakis said 
then he responded 
george bush has some of the highest negatives ever recorded in 
the history of american politics and i think one of the reasons 
for it is people have seen his campaign as an essentially negative 
campaign dukakis said 
bush touring the superdome where the party will bestow its 
nomination next week denied that he was engaging in negative 
campaigning 
no no very positive bush said as he visited with 
teenagers painting signs for the convention weve got to get 
these differences in focus 
he also called for a party platform that will stand up well in 
comparison with what he called the democrats document of 
deceit with the convention his and no serious arguments within 
the party bush was certain to get the platform he wants although 
the party subcommittees took testimony into the night from more 
than 200 witnesses 
we need to make this campaign a plan for the future a 
statement of solutions not an exercise in evasion bush said 
the one mystery about the four days of republican meeting 
bushs choice of a vice president stayed a mystery 
still working on it was bushs comment monday sticking with 
his promise to announce his decision on the last day of the 
convention 
members of the partys committee on contests tried to resolve 
challenges to as many as 39 of the 48 delegates from georgia bush 
won the primary there but supporters of television evangelist pat 
robertson made a run at taking over the party machinery 
regardless who is seated the delegates must vote for bush

the bright lights of night baseball illuminated 
wrigley field for the first time in 74 years but the historic game 
was cut short when the rain came and lightning bolts lit up the sky 
i feel like we saw the beginning of history being made but we 
didnt get to see the end lawyer donald kurasch said monday 
night as the heavy rain halted the game in the bottom of the 
fourth inning with the chicago cubs leading the philadelphia 
phillies 31 
two hours after 91yearold cubs fan harry grossman declared 
let there be light and threw the switch that turned on the 
towering wrigley field lights the clouds took over 
the game at the last majorleague ballpark with dayonly games 
was postponed two hours and 10 minutes later delaying wrigleys 
first official night game until tonights contest between the cubs 
and the new york mets 
mondays rain was seen as symptomatic of the cubs seemingly 
endless disappointments to its fans like when the team blew 
potential championships in 1984 and 1969 
its kind of like the fates are against them said mike 
quigley a neighborhood activist who led the fight against night 
games 
some made out anyway scalpers got up to 250 for tickets 
rooftops with views of the field were rented out for as much as 
1000 
fans with tickets to monday nights game can exchange them for 
any game for which tickets are available or get refunds the cubs 
said they wont be able to attend tonights game its sold out 
the day began with boundless optimism for cubs fans 
throngs filled the wrigleyville neighborhood early many 
chugging beer an army of vendors hawked commemorative tshirts for 
up to 15 a piece 
i think its beautiful said paula torres 62 as she sat on 
the stoop across from wrigleys main entrance in 99degree heat 
it seems like everybodys in a good mood despite the heat i 
havent seen a crabby face yet 
some residents prepared for the worst organizing patrols 
against drunkeness and vandalism 
i never minded the day games because its daylight and you can 
see what the people are doing but i mind the night games said 
shirley habbe 56 who has lived less than a block from wrigleys 
main entrance for 20 years 
as daylight faded parts of the neighborhood began resembling a 
party 
on the roof of one apartment building across from wrigleys 
rightfield wall 45 peopled attended a catered party where the 
women wore cocktail dresses and the men black ties tuxedo tops and 
hawaiian shorts 
about 250 people many clutching beer cans gathered behind the 
leftfield wall to watch the lights being turned on and try to 
catch a home run ball 
in their midst stood randy murphy who drove 300 miles to 
chicago from lovington in central illinois even though he was not 
among the sellout crowd of 39000 with tickets 
we just couldnt pass this up this is just incredible its a 
great big party you can just go from bar to bar to bar he said 
police were prepared with a force of 172 officers including 
mounted patrols and canine units but few problems materialized 
authorities reported at least five arrests including three for 
ticket scalping and two vendor violations and city officials said 
more than 60 illegally parked cars were towed by the start of the 
game 
ivycovered wrigley built in 1914 held on to its daytimeonly 
baseball tradition decades longer than any other ballpark in the 
nation the last team to light up the detroit tigers did it 40 
years ago 
city council voted in february to lift the ban on lights despite 
fierce opposition from a neighborhood group known as cubs 
citizens united for baseball in the sunshine 
the team has eight night games for this season and 18 for every 
year until 2002 
but quigley vicepresident of the opposing neighborhood group 
vowed monday night that wrigleyvilles residents wont give up 
their fight begun in 1981 when the tribune co bought the cubs and 
announced its plans to erect lights 
if the group fails to halt night games or at least win a curfew 
and other restrictions quigley predicted the wrigleyville 
precinct would vote the area dry of alcohol in the spring 1989 
municipal election 
i think it would be a real disservice especially watching 
this carnival atmosphere to give up the fight quigley said

a woman and her three sons were convicted of 
murder for the slayings of three police officers in a shootout and 
motel siege stemming from a badcheck warrant 
a wayne county circuit court jury deliberated for 17 hours over 
four days before returning the verdicts monday alberta easter and 
her sons william lemons 44 roy lemons 48 and george lemons 46 
all were found guilty of three counts of firstdegree murder 
they were charged in the deaths of inkster sgt ira parker 41 
and officers daniel dubiel 36 and clay hoover 24 whose 
bulletriddled bodies lay in a motel room while the family held 
police at bay for 10 hours 
the sons also were found guilty of numerous felony firearms and 
felonious assault charges 
attorneys for the defendants said they would appeal the verdicts 
i think their minds were made up early and they werent able 
to resist the pressure to convict said gerald evelyn easters 
attorney im disappointed its a very tough case to resist the 
pressure to do a lot of things the jury did 
the defendants displayed no emotions publicly while families and 
friends of the slain officers hugged two wayne county assistant 
prosecutors after the verdict was announced 
the survivors and loved ones reminded me every day of what was 
at stake assistant prosecutor douglas baker said 
the officers had been trying to serve a bad check warrant on 
easter and one of the lemons when they were shot 
easter had claimed both that the officers shot each other while 
exchanging gunfire with the family inside the room and that they 
were shot during exchanges between the family and other officers 
outside 
autopsy reports said the officers were killed within minutes of 
entering the motel room hoover and dubiel were shot 29 times each 
one report said 
police and the easter family exchanged gunfire during the night 
of july 9 1987 before the family gave up early the next day they 
have been jailed since 
judge richard hathaway scheduled sentencing for sept 13 the 
murder convictions carry mandatory life prison terms

the refusal of three alleged victims to 
testify in a preschool molestation trial could force the dismissal 
of 27 charges prosecutors said the defense however said the 
case is collapsing of its own weakness 
the children balked because they are traumatized and want to 
avoid reviving painful memories deputy district attorney lael 
rubin said outside court following mondays surprise announcement 
two boys have continuing nightmares and a girl has lost her 
memory of all events up to a year ago a sign of massive 
depression ms rubin said the children were students at the 
mcmartin preschool 
while we have a responsibility to present all of the evidence 
we also have a responsiblity not to increase trauma to kids she 
said 
without the testimony trying to prove the allegations against 
raymond buckey 30 and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey 61 
would be an extraordinarily difficult thing to do ms rubin 
said 
the buckeys are charged with 99 molestions and one joint count 
of conspiracy although 82 of the counts name only buckey thirty 
charges rest on the testimony of the three children who refused to 
testify and on another child who declined to take the stand last 
month 
thus nearly a third of the remaining charges could be dropped 
if the judge finds insufficient evidence to support them 
the elimination of some witnesses also means the yearlong trial 
part of a 5yearold case could end within a month ms rubin 
said 
following the disclosure the prosecution called to the witness 
stand kee macfarlane the social worker whose interviews with 
hundreds of children in the case became a point of controversy in 
pretrial hearings 
ms macfarlane testified that she used games and picture 
coloring to get some children talking about their alleged 
molestations 
the jury watched a videotape in which she asked a girl to 
identify body parts on naked dolls 
the defense has contended that the children were coached or 
coerced by the social worker or their parents into alleging 
molestation 
nine children have testified so far in the case that once 
focused on 41 youngsters but buckeys attorney danny davis said 
outside court he had suspected that some child witnesses would be 
dropped 
the remaining three witnesses had more contradicitions and 
unbelievable accounts in their testimony he said they were 
a liablity to the prosecution 
i think the prosecution case is falling of its own weight

sixtythree antiabortion activists using the 
names baby jane doe and baby john doe which they say 
represent aborted fetuses will remain jailed until they tell 
police their real names a judge ruled 
police arrested 69 people over the weekend at three abortion 
clinics in atlanta bringing to 276 the number of protesters 
arrested since the series of demonstrations began during the 
democratic national convention july 19 
about 170 members of the group sponsoring the protest operation 
rescue remained in jail monday most are charged with criminal 
trespass and giving a false name to police 
operation rescue based in binghamton ny has been using a 
cable television show hosted by former republican presidential 
candidate pat robertson to recruit volunteers to continue filling 
the jails 
on monday state court judge nick g lambros ruled the legal 
cases against 63 of them would not proceed until they gave their 
real names 
bob fierer an attorney for the activists said he will abide by 
the order unless or until some other court says it is not 
correct 
fulton county jail officials said they have spent 66450 to 
hold and feed those arrested officials say the influx of 
protesters is straining already crowded county facilities 
operation rescue says lengthy daily coverage on the 700 
club robertsons show on the christian broadcasting network is 
helping attract many abortion opponents to atlanta 
he is our one link to christians all across the country that 
we have not had from the secular media said the groups 
spokesman lowell patterson 
the 700 club a 90minute daily show with about a halfhour news 
segment has been carrying regular reports on the atlanta 
antiabortion protests and flashing the binghamton telephone number 
on the screen during the reports 
robertson declined to be interviewed but a spokeswoman said 
robertson contends he is only providing news coverage of an 
important event

weather experts usually are loathe to say 
anything nice about hurricanes but some are conceding that the big 
tropical storms could be something of a blessing during the drought 
people who dont live along the atlantic or gulf coasts should 
be hoping for hurricanes douglas lecomte editor of the 
agriculture departments weekly weather and crop bulletin said 
tuesday 
i think most people are really hoping for a benign hurricane 
to move up the mississippi valley and really drench the tennessee 
valley lecomte said 
what we really want is to get a hurricane and take the wind 
away and take the tornadoes away but keep the rain said richard 
heim a meteorologist at the national climatic data center in 
asheville nc 
of course if you get one you get the other heim observed 
so if we get a nice hurricane to put a dent in the drought it 
can also put a dent in a lot of peoples property 
hurricanes natures most powerful storms develop over warm 
tropical waters and churn into huge systems with winds as high as 
100 mph or more the hurricane season starts in june but the storms 
tend to be most active in august and september 
right now tropical storm beryl is churning up the gulf of 
mexico near new orleans 
historically hurricanes have caused massive destruction of 
oceanfront properties weather experts say the winds and surge of 
sea water driven ahead of the storms are especially dangerous once 
they move inland hurricanes lose the energy derived from the ocean 
and break up sometimes producing powerful thunderstorms 
these storms often provide 5 inches of rain or more and can 
produce a major share of the annual moisture in some areas 
in 1980 for example a serious drought in texas was broken by 
the combined rains of hurricane allen and tropical storm danielle 
yet hurricanes also can produce so much moisture that droughts 
may be replaced by equally disastrous flooding 
alvin texas was swamped by 43 inches of rain in 24 hours on 
july 2425 1979 in two days in september 1950 yankeetown fla 
was drenched by 387 inches of rain 
this year as drought continues to plague much of the nation 
the onset of hurricane season even if the storms prove as benign 
as lecomte would hope probably would benefit only limited areas 
what we would like it to do to help end the drought is for 
a storm to move into the georgia and tennessee and north carolina 
and kentucky areas and sit here for two or three days thats the 
optimum thing heim said 
axel graumann of the asheville data center said hurricanes 
usually move along the gulf and atlantic coasts and bring more 
relief to the southeast than most other areas others tend to move 
northward as far as new england and canada 
it is possible for remnants of gulf coast hurricanes to move as 
far inland as oklahoma kansas and missouri but that is very 
very unlikely heim said it is very rare for rain clouds from a 
hurricane to become caught up in a cold front and move even farther 
inland 
about the only way to quickly make up the 10 to 15 inches of 
rain needed in the tennessee valley would be a hurricane but i 
dont think anybody wants it all at once lecomte said

threatened by wildfires and tourism in wyomings yellowstone 
national park returned to normal but crews continued battling 
blazes in montana and idaho 
the largest forest fire of oregons season moved away from two 
lakeside resorts in the deschutes national forest when winds

helicopter crashed while carrying water to the blaze monday the 
pilot was listed in fair condition today at a hospital where he 
was treated for a head injury cuts and bruises 
in wyoming tourists continued pouring into yellowstone despite 
forest fires covering some 180000 acres of the park 
lower temperatures and higher humidy have curbed many fires 
the fires have slowed down spokeswoman joan anzelmo said 
i know we did not see significant increase in acreage and all 
the fires continue to be contained within the park boundaries

tourists a closer look at some burned acreage where many trees 
survived the flames the south entrance to the park was open all

this time of year

senate majority leader robert c byrd said 
today there is no room for further compromise with republicans on 
aid to nicaraguas contra rebels because weve gone as far as we 
can go 
byrd dwva told reporters he is prepared to press the 
democratic aid plan to a vote and continues to hope it will attract 
bipartisan support 
that would send the right message to central america he 
said 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
were still hopeful of getting a contra aid package passed 
speaking to reporters not long after president reagan met with 
republican congressional leaders fitzwater said the democrats 
say they want a bill but he also said that the language of 
the democratic bill is convoluted 
many republican senators made it clear monday they do not trust 
the democrats to carry out their side of the bargain they said the 
democratic aid plan is seriously flawed because it does not contain 
adequate resources to deliver stockpiled arms to the contras and 
has no guarantee house speaker james wright will permit a vote 
byrd was asked if there was any flexibility on his side of the 
issue 
no i dont think so he replied it seems to me weve 
gone as far as we can go 
fitzwater said the administration is concerned about what he 
called weaknesses in the democratic bill with respect to systems 
for getting assistance delivered to the contras 
he said that bill would have the impact of saying you can 
deliver it in honduras but not in nicaragua and thats where the 
troops are 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas speaking monday 
after a private meeting in which many republicans objected to the 
democratic plan said he would take one more shot at 
negotiating a bipartisan aid package 
however he added i wouldnt want to be overly optimistic 
byrd also said he hoped some compromise could be reached 
but sen john mccain rariz said compromise was unlikely 
because the debate over aid to the rebels fighting nicaraguas 
leftist sandinista government has been so long so emotional so 
partisan that theres little trust 
sen christopher dodd dconn who took part in talks with 
republicans on the compromise legislation last week said flatly 
the negotiations are over i dont think there is any more room 
weve gone as far as we can go 
the democratic plan would permit 271 million in immediate 
nonlethal humanitarian aid to the contras 
it also would give president reagan an opportunity to ask 
congress this fall to release some 163 million in previously 
purchased arms ammunition and other military supplies now stored 
in warehouses in central america 
but it also requires reagan to certify that such military aid to 
the contras is justified because nicaragua has disrupted the 
peace and stability of central america by taking two of these 
three actions an unprovoked military attack on the contras 
blatant violations of the regional peace plan and continued 
unacceptable levels of military assistance by sovietbloc 
countries including cuba 
some senators said nicaraguas rulers could prevent the military 
aid from being released just by being good boys for 30 days 
conservative republicans called on dole to force a vote on a 
republican alternative which would make 20 million in new us 
military aid available to the contras as well as releasing 
previously approved military aid from warehouses and providing the 
humanitarian assistance 
sources inside the meeting said army lt gen colin powell 
president reagans national security adviser reported that he has 
serious reservations about the plan 
byrd said that if progress is not made in reconstructing a 
bipartisan alliance on the issue he will offer the democratic aid 
plan as an amendment to the pending defense department 
appropriations bill 
contra leaders contacted the white house and several gop 
senators monday morning to declare their unanimous opposition to 
that plan 
bosco matamoros a spokesman for the contra resistance forces 
said contra leaders see the democratic plan as resulting from 
internal politics in the united states which basically seek to 
reward nicaraguan president daniel ortega for not complying with 
the commitments of the peace process

defense contractors routinely overcharge the 
government for spare parts and the excess charges although small 
in percentage terms total hundreds of millions of dollars the 
pentagon said tuesday 
an unusually broad internal defense audit found that nearly half 
the contracts reviewed involved some measure of overcharging 
in the majority of instances the auditors reported the 
overcharges resulted from a military contractors failure to abide 
by a law requiring the company to share with the government the 
latest information it has on labor and material costs 
if the pentagon receives defective cost or pricing data in 
the course of contract negotiations the result is almost always an 
overcharge to the government the auditors noted 
the audit conducted by the pentagons inspector general took 
more than three years to complete and was one of the largest ever 
conducted it reviewed 774 contracts and subcontracts worth a 
combined 543 billion held by 95 companies 
of the 774 pricing actions audited 365 472 percent were 
overpriced by 7889 million the report said 
the principal reasons for the overpricing were that 
contractors did not comply with public law 87653 truth in 
negotiations act on 359 of the 774 pricing actions 
that level of overpricing amounts to slightly less than 15 
percent of the total value of the contracts audited the report 
added 
by law the defense department can recover money overcharged by 
contractors with interest the governments claims can be 
contested by the contractors and the disputes resolved through 
negotiations 
the pentagon in releasing the inspector generals audit 
announced the department had so far recovered 283 million of the 
7889 million identified in the report 
the department will continue to examine all costs questioned 
and to recommend appropriate actions the pentagon added 
the inspector general concluded his report by suggesting the 
pentagon hire more auditors recommending the department provide 
the funding and resources needed to substantially increase the 
level of defective price audit coverage provided 
the report noted that historically the audit agency can 
recover about 19 in excess costs for every dollar spent on price 
audits 
that recommendation however already has become the subject of 
an internal dispute robert w helm the pentagons comptroller 
said in comments attached to the report he did not view the 
findings as adequate justification for the expense of hiring more 
auditors 
he and other pentagon officials said the current force of 
auditors could improve the situation by helping defense contractors 
devise more accurate methods of estimating costs for use during 
negotiations

rodrigo borja the socialist 
presidentelect takes office wednesday committed to ending 
ecuadors prous stand reversing freemarket economic policies 
and negotiating easier terms on the foreign debt 
borja who leads the democratic left party has said one of his 
first acts will be to renew diplomatic ties with nicaraguas 
leftist sandinista government 
a us official said privately washington feels it can work with 
the new president borja may prove to be a problem for the us 
at times but he is no threat to democracy in ecuador the 
official said 
relations with nicaragua were broken in october 1985 by 
conservative president leon febres cordero washingtons closest 
ally in south america whom borja replaces febres cordero could 
not run for reelection becaue the constitution does not permit a 
president to serve consecutive terms 
reestablishment of relations is a sign that our government is 
independent and sovereign said gonzalo ortiz official spokesman 
of the new administration 
borja a 53yearold law professor who is a vice president of 
the socialist international is a longtime political foe of febres 
cordero and lost a presidential election runoff to him in 1984 he 
won the presidency in may defeating populist candidate abdala 
bucaram 
ecuador a south american nation of 10 million people about the 
size of colorado returned to democracy in 1979 after nine years of 
civilian and military dictatorships 
president daniel ortega of nicaragua is among seven latin 
american presidents most of them leftists scheduled to attend 
they include fidel castro of cuba whose trips abroad are not 
frequent and his visit is viewed in ecuador as an unusual show of 
support for the new president 
secretary of state george p shultz will represent the united 
states mario soares the socialist president of portugal also 
plans to attend 
borja has said he will seek close relations with the 
organization of nations that profess nonalignment and end febres 
corderos freemarket policies which he blames for the worst 
recession since ecuador began exporting oil in the early 1970s 
the economy shrank by 35 percent in 1987 and the annual 
inflation rate is nearly 60 percent the highest in five years 
fewer than half the nations workers have fulltime jobs 
febres cordero took pride in meeting obligations on the 92 
billion foreign debt for most of his fouryear term but no 
payments have been made since january and ecuador is more than 1 
billion in arrears 
officials of the febres cordero government blame the nations 
economic problems on the decline of world oil prices and 
earthquakes that crippled the oil industry for six months in 1987 
the new president has said he will impose exchange controls 
restrict imports to save dollar reserves and control prices of 
basic consumer goods to fight inflation 
he also has announced plans for a more restrictive policy toward 
foreign investment and unless creditors agree to easier terms a 
moratorium on foreign debt payments 
i dont believe the debt is payable under the present 
circumstances he said recently 
personal animosity between borja and febres cordero has created 
problems in the transition of power 
febres cordero said he would not attend the inauguration or 
follow the ecuadorean custom of personally turning over the 
presidential sash to his successor 
since the wellfare of the ecuadorean people depends on the 
next government may god help them and insure their success he 
said friday but knowing them as i do i have my doubts 
besides the personal feud ecuadors political turmoil in recent 
years has included two unsuccessful military rebellions against 
febres cordero a kidnapping of the president in which disaffected 
paratroopers held him for 11 hours and an attempt by the 
oppositioncontrolled congress to impeach him 
borja has accused febres cordero of trying to sabotage the new 
government by creating economic problems before he takes office 
we are concerned by the bankrupt state in which we are 
receiving ecuador he said and charged the febres cordero 
administration with creating an 11 percent budget deficit to 
cause us difficulties with inflation 
interior minister heinz moeller described the complaints as 
whining

investigators today blamed the leftist 
guerrilla group comando simon bolivar for the bombing attack on 
secretary of state george p shultz 
the group which described itself as antiimperialist in 
calls to news agencies claiming responsiblity for mondays blast 
also was behind at least two other bombings in bolivia since april 
1987 
on monday foreign minister guillermo bedregal said both the 
attack on shultzs motorcade and a dawn bombing at the us embassy 
commissary in la paz were the work of cocaine traffickers 
the native national force of pablo zarate wilca a previously 
unknown group also called reporters to say it was behind mondays 
bombings but officials discounted that claim 
bolivian investigators offered no elaboration on why they gave 
credit to the claim of responsibility from the comando simon 
bolivar group they would only say the group carried out other 
bombings and bank robberies 
a remotecontrolled bomb damaged three cars in shultzs 
11vehicle motorcade monday as he drove to la paz from the airport 
the blast ruptured a tire and blew out three windows including one 
next to shultzs wife 
no injuries were reported in the roadway blast or in the bombing 
at the us commissary 
police said the roadway bomb believed to be several sticks of 
dynamite was set off by someone on a hill overlooking the road 
seconds after shultzs car passed the blast tore up pavement and 
threw rocks across the road 
on monday night shultz praised bolivian efforts he said have 
put drug lords on the run the secretary of state whose visit 
intended in part to express us support for antidrug efforts 
said he was not intimidated by the tactic of using violence to 
try to scare government officials 
after giving a talk entitled winning the war against 
narcotics at a la paz hotel shultz left through a back exit 
under extremely tight security and was driven to the airport for a 
flight to costa rica 
this time the airport road was cordoned off 
the 67yearold shultz has been secretary of state since 1982 
he has traveled widely but has never before been attacked 
in his talk to government officials and business leaders shultz 
praised bolivias cooperation with the united states in recent 
antidrug efforts 
he said congress has looked at your law and your performance 
with great interest and i trust that your steady commitment will 
convince the members of our legislative body of your serious 
intentions to sum up the drug traffickers are in trouble in 
bolivia 
last month bolivia passed a law that declares 90 percent of 
coca plantations in the country illegal and imposes stiff penalties 
on coca producers and traffickers 
it also captured roberto suarez gomez who the us drug 
enforcement administration called one of the worlds leading 
cocaine traffickers suarez gomez is serving a 15year prison 
sentence 
us economic aid topped the agenda in meetings with shultz 
said planning minister gonzalo sanchez de lozada he said shultz 
had promised to speed up disbursements of funds congress has 
approved 
the united states has allocated 75 million in aid to bolivia 
for fiscal 1988 of that amount 15 million is earmarked for 
narcotics interdiction and crop substitution efforts 
but bedregal says bolivia needs at least 120 million a year to 
effectively combat the drug industry which brings in up to 500 
million a year compared to 470 million for all legal exports 
combined 
aside from funding for development programs in the main coca 
producing region the us government has an estimated 40 special 
forces and navy troops as well as border patrol and dea agents in 
bolivia 
they have trained and equipped 650 bolivian antinarcotics 
police and assisted in raiding cocaine processing pits in the 
chapare where 80 percent of bolivias cocaine is produced 
police however must often attack cocaine processing labs using 
world war iivintage carbines while traffickers have sophisticated 
automatic weapons 
shultz said the the united states as the biggest consumer of 
drugs in the world has a special responsibility in this battle 
the pirates and warlords of the drug business have fought you 
at every step with money intimidation and violence he told the 
gathering but there can be no question that bolivia has made the 
right choice we salute you for that choice 
us cooperation with government efforts to fight the drug trade 
has angered the 350000 farmers from among bolivias 67 million 
population who depend on coca leaf farming and cocaine production 
for a living 
they say the us and bolivian governments are not doing enough 
to assist in the transition to other crops 
shultz on a 10day ninecountry latin american tour flew to 
bolivia from brazil his tour began aug 1 in guatemala city and is 
scheduled to end wednesday in ecuador

tropical storm beryl moved onshore across new 
orleans today prompting storm alerts for 16 coastal parishes and 
raising hopes that it would move farther inland and dissipate 
without causing serious damage 
if it continues to move west or northwest beryl should 
gradually weaken the national weather service reported 
there was still a chance the storm might move back over the gulf 
of mexico and gain strength before returning to land but 
forecasters said that would e unusual 
the coast guard today rescued six people who were forced to take 
refuge on petit bois island south of pascagoula miss after the 
storm prevented them from landing their boat on the mainland 
authorities said 
more louisiana coastal communities were evacuated as the storm 
which had already forced thousands of offshore oil workers inland 
drifted slowly along the louisianamississippi gulf coast 
no injuries or serious damage were reported

washington has indicated it will allow us 
businessmen to launch satellites on chinese rockets a probeijing 
newspaper reported tuesday 
yu fusheng vice general manager of china great wall industry 
corp said monday the us state department unofficially had made 
it known to chinese officials that washington would not oppose the 
shipment of satellites to china for launch the newspaper wen wei 
po reported 
gen william burns director of the us arms control and 
disarmament agency said at a news conference in this british 
colony after returning from beijing that he could not comment on 
the report 
the united states and the coordinating committee for export 
control of 16 western nations have held up requests to use chinese 
rockets to launch satellites for foreign companies 
security concerns and accusations of chinas alleged unfair 
price advantage because of government subsidization have been cited 
as reasons for refusing to allow the launches 
the newspaper quoted yu whose staterun company is in charge of 
launching satellites on communist chinas long march rockets as 
playing down security concerns he stressed that the launch service 
was a business endeavor and not an attempt to obtain foreign 
technology 
foreign companies would be allowed to watch over their 
satellites in china the newspaper quoted him as saying the 
satellites would be considered in transit from the time they enter 
china through customs until launch yu said 
he also denied that china would allow its launch service to be 
used for satellites with military applications the newspaper 
reported from beijing 
yu also claimed that china was able to offer lowpriced 
satellite launchings partly because labor costs are lower than in 
other countries offering such services and not because of 
government subsidies 
hughes aircraft co a subsidiary of hughes communications 
international has asked the state department to approve chinese 
launching of a usbuilt satellite for an australian company 
asia satellite communications a hong kongbased consortium 
also has asked washington for permission to send up a usmade 
satellite on a long march rocket next year 
pressure from western governments has prevented chinas 
international satellite launching industry from getting of the 
ground although beijing has signed accords with several countries 
including britain and sweden on space cooperation the only firm 
deal has been a joint venture reached with brazil 
that satellite to be used to study flora minerals and 
underground water supplies is scheduled for launch in 1992

the bodies of 10 people who died in 
indias worst ferry disaster were cremated tuesday on the banks of 
the ganges river as police fired seven gunshots in honor of the 
more than 400 passengers believed drowned 
hindu and moslem priests prayed as the bodies were placed on 
wooden logs and set aflame near the river that hindus consider 
sacred about 1000 relatives and villagers watched silently

hit a sand bar while crossing the river and hurled at least 542 
people into the surging waters about 650 miles east of new delhi

small boats only 30 bodies have been recovered and the rest of the 
passengers are presumed dead officials said 
most of the passengers were hindu pilgrims on their way to a 
shrine 
the government blamed the accident on overcrowding and safety 
violations according to officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity the ferry had a capacity of 160 
two steampowered boats and 70 rescue workers have tried to pull 
the vessel from the river bed but the search has been hampered by 
swift currents and rising water levels caused by monsoon rains 
asgar ali who heads the recovery effort said bodies are 
believed to be trapped inside the ferry but none have been found 
so far he said many of the bodies were carried away by strong 
currents 
indias worst previous ferry disaster occurred in 1970 when at 
least 150 people drowned in the krishna river in the southern state 
of andhra pradesh

vice president george bush today accused 
michael dukakis of trying to run away from a record on the 
very very far liberal fringe and said his democratic rival is 
losing his lead in the presidential race 
bush at a news conference here predicted dukakis would fall 
back from the 17point advantage he has registered in some national 
polls 
that is turning around bush said you watch in the next 
couple of days youll see evidence of the turnaround on that he 
did not elaborate 
just six days before the opening of the republican national 
convention in new orleans where he will become the gop 
presidential nominee bush said he still has not decided who will 
be his running mate 
im not close in the sense of like tomorrow making a final 
decision the vice president said bush has said he wants to keep 
it a secret until the final day of the convention 
bush spoke at an airport news conference here after a speech 
earlier in erie later he planned to fly to philadelphia for a 
ribboncutting at the polishamerican congress museum and to take 
part in a crimefighting effort called the national night out 
against crime americans in more than 7200 towns plan to turn on 
porch and house lights as a symbolic message that they intend to 
fight for safer neighborhoods 
bush did not mention dukakis in his speech but went after him 
at the news conference 
hes trying to run away from a record in massachusetts on the 
very very far liberal fringe of the political spectrum and i have 
to pin him down and i have to get him to say what hes really for 
bush said and hes unwilling to do that because he thinks he can 
preempt the middle 
bush said he was urging speakers the gop convention to be 
positive and to focus on the issues 
but i cant guarantee that somebodys not going to take a 
swipe at michael dukakis bush said i have a lot of friends 
out there and they didnt like the vicious personal attacks 
against bush at the democratic convention and i did not react to 
them but i cant control everbody but im urging them to stay 
positive as im doing 
in erie earlier bush blamed liberals in congress for 
undermining the battle against illegal drugs and told a gathering 
of police officers lets get tougher on the criminals 
in a speech billed as nonpartisan bush did not mention dukakis 
by name but he criticized the american civil liberties union 
whose members he has said include dukakis 
he said that to win the war against drugs the nation must be as 
committed as it was in world war ii when the whole nation then 
pulled together one purpose one cause everyone working in 
exactly the same direction weve got to plan an attack at every 
level of government 
bush spoke before the pennsylvania chapter of the fraternal 
order of police on his last major campaign trip before the 
republican national convention 
trying to forge an image as a hardliner on law enforcement 
bush said when it comes to criminal justice our first priority 
must be to keep the criminals away from the good and decent people 
who want to raise their families in peace and safety 
there are those like the aclu whose first concerns are the 
protection of the criminals rights and the potential abuse of 
power by police the vice president said my first concerns are 
the protection of lawabiding citizens and the abuse of our system 
of constitutional protections by thugs who can go and hire smart 
lawyers and find the right judges to set them free 
so lets not take away the guns of innocent citizens he 
continued lets get tougher on the criminals 
bush said that too often police are being denied the ammunition 
they need to fight the battle against drugs congress is full of 
rhetorical heroes on the issue of drugs but when it comes to law 
enforcement a lot of the liberals there go awol he said 
bush said the budget request for the coast guard was slashed by 
72 million last year in order to provide more money for mass 
transit and amtrak resulting in a 55 percent reduction in coast 
guard air and sea patrols 
he also blamed the liberals in the senate for derailing 
sentencing guidelines necessary for implementing a federal death 
penalty under constitutional standards set by a 1972 supreme court 
decision 
bush said americans must insist that judges accept new federal 
sentencing guidelines that mandate consistently tougher penalties 
we also need to change the legal technicalities that set 
criminals free he said theres something wrong with the 
system when the modernday version of a prison break is crawling 
through a loophole 
he praised the administration of former pennsylvania gov 
richard thornburgh now the attorney generaldesignate for 
reducing by 94 percent the early release of convicted felons in the 
state and said thornburgh effectively ended the early release or 
parole of firstdegree murderers 
bush called for more money for building prisons and said that 
unnecessary military bases should be converted to prisons or 
rehabilitation facilities he also urged that states that have 
decriminalized possession of drugs should reverse course 
and to those who say drugs should be legalized i say this 
legalization is just another word for surrender and surrender is 
not in americas vocabulary 
one day earlier bush praised jesse jacksons efforts to compat 
drug abuse saying anybody who can raise the consciousness of 
the young people of this country about staying away from drugs 
certainly can have a useful role but he made no promises when 
asked if the former democratic presidential candidate might have a 
role in his administration working on the drug issue

whether he wins the november election or not 
george bush is way ahead in one contest johnny carson told more 
jokes about him than any other political candidate in the first 
half of 1988 
carsons monologues on the tonight show considered one 
indicator of what people outside politics are thinking were 
analyzed by daniel amundson and s robert lichter 
the two researchers who also looked at comedian david 
lettermans monologues on late night published their findings 
on political humor in the magazine public opinion 
poor george bush endured a veritable comedic vivisection 
the pair wrote the latenight hosts carved up his record his 
campaign tactics and his manhood 
carson on bushs speaking ability the last time george bush 
gave a speech someone came up and drew a chalk outline around his 
body 
in iowa i think george bush went too far when he stuffed 
straw in his overalls and started to sing if i only had a brain 
and during super tuesday season down south he went into a 
truck stop wearing a pair of overalls but he had a little 
alligator sewn over the pocket 
amundson and lichter looked at the carson and letterman 
monologues from jan 1 to june 7 they found that carson was far 
more political than letterman and included jokes about at least one 
candidate in nearly every new episode of his show 
bushs campaign manager lee atwater has said he pays close 
attention to the carson monologues as a barometer of how the 
candidates play in the real america beyond the beltway the 
highway that encircles washington lichter and amundson said 
and atwaters not the only one 
when johnny carson talks candidates have to listen says 
lichter they listen to hear what america is hearing 
republican contenders were the butt of carsons jokes twice as 
often as the democrats with bush the target of 32 barbs followed 
by bob dole with 18 and pat robertson with 17 
on the democratic side gary hart attracted 15 jokes dick 
gephardt was the target of nine and bruce babbit drew five 
the lower numbers for the democrats reflect the writers strike 
that put the tonight show on reruns during the peak of democratic 
campaigning in the midwest and new york the authors said it 
certainly doesnt mean they were any less laughable than the 
republicans 
the hart jokes centered on his relationship with model donna 
rice starting in january when carson remarked that gary hart 
made a stunning statement today he said if he was elected he would 
not be the first adulterer in the white house but he would be the 
best 
letterman got into the act the researchers reported on the day 
president reagan had his annual physical reagan says he has the 
body of a 20yearold which if i remember correctly is very much 
like the gary hart campaign slogan the comedian said 
amundson and lichter said most of the jokes focused on gaffes 
and personal foibles gephardts appearance and the utter 
hopelessness of babbitts quest 
im not sure if i want a president who has to draw in his 
face carson said after what the researchers called the 
mysterious appearance of gephardts eyebrows before the iowa 
caucuses 
and when babbitt endorsed michael dukakis carson cracked 
babbitt lending support to dukakis is like sandy duncan lending 
her bra to oprah winfrey 
carson disputed robertsons claim that planned parenthood was 
formed to create a master race obviously thats not true carson 
said or wed have a better class of presidential candidates 
conspicuously absent from the barrage of quips was democratic 
nominee dukakis a straightlaced candidate lichter said he and 
amundson are thinking of continuing their survey through the 
general election campaign just to see if johnny carson can find 
something funny about mike dukakis

soviet astronomers are proposing an orbiting 
100ton superobservatory more massive than anything planned in 
the west to be launched late in this century 
nikolai s kardashev a member of the soviet academy of 
sciences said tuesday that preliminary engineering studies of the 
superobservatory envision three powerful instruments to gain 
unprecedented views of the heavens 
in an interview at the 20th assembly of the international 
astronomical union kardashev said plans call for parts of the 
observatory to be sent into earth orbit aboard the soviets 
powerful energia rocket 
the observatory would be assembled in orbit either by robots 
or by astronauts and cosmonauts he said 
a second rocket then would send the observatory to the socalled 
lagrangian point l2 about 900000 miles from earth where the 
gravitational attraction of the earth moon and sun balance each 
other an object left in l2 would remain at that point 
this would give a very high resolution of the whole 
universe said kardashev he said the sun earth and moon would 
be visible at all times from l2 in one direction while the rest 
of the universe could be seen by pointing instruments outward away 
from the sun 
an observatory at l2 would orbit the sun in about the same 
period as the earth 
kardashev said instruments proposed for the observatory are an 
xray and gammaray detector a 400meter radio telescope and a 
10meter optical telescope 
the optical telescope would be about four times more powerful 
than the 1 billion space telescope planned for launch next year by 
the national aeronautics and space administration 
kardashev said observation data collected by the instruments 
would be sent by radio signals to ground stations or satellites 
and the observatory would be able to operate around the clock 
this would be a very big project and we are very interested in 
international cooperation he said 
kardashev said the cost would be one billion rubles or 
dollars but american astronomers say a project of the scale 
decribed by the soviets would cost must more than that 
the soviet scientist said it is believed that if the project is 
started soon it would be ready for launch by the year 2000 
the soviets said in a statement the superobservatory can only 
be realized in the context of broad international collaboration 
we herewith invite all interested parties to contact us at 
their earliest convenience the announcement said

white house officials prepared today to 
announce a successor to education secretary william bennett amid 
indications the job will go to lauro cavazos president of texas 
tech university who could become the first hispanic cabinet member 
administration officials would not discuss plans to announce the 
choice to succeed bennett who announced in may that he wished to 
leave the administration by around midseptember 
nor would officials confirm that cavazos was set to be nominated 
for the post although it was learned that the 61yearold college 
president had traveled from the texas tech campus in lubbock to the 
nations capital 
cavazos had been scheduled to appear today at a meeting of tech 
officials and representatives of the state legislative budget board 
and the governors budget office but did not attend that meeting 
neither bennett nor cavazos could immediately be reached for 
comment 
loye miller a spokesman for bennett declined to comment 
the lubbock avalanchejournal had quoted sources as saying that 
cavazos was being considered for the job 
the newspaper said today that it was told by sources in 
washington that cavazos was on a very short list of candidates 
cavazos who has served as techs president since april 1980 
received the national hispanic leadership award of the league of 
united latin american citizens in july for his work in education 
he was cited for his efforts to reduce the dropout rate among 
hispanic youth 
several lubbock residents told the newspaper that they had been 
contacted in the last few days by federal agents conducting a 
background check on cavazos they were not given reasons for the 
queries which are a routine part of the appointment process 
cavazos possible selection might be considered an effort by 
republicans to court the hispanic vote in south texas since he is a 
native of that area and a son of a foreman of the santa gertrudis 
division of the storied king ranch 
cavazos announced in may that he would resign as president of 
texas tech in july 1989 and after a leave return to teach anatomy 
in the medical school where he has tenure

south korean officials disappointed 
that north korea rejected a proposal to work out details for 
fullscale negotiations said they will agree to a meeting on the 
communist nations demand to be cohost of the olympics sources 
said tuesday 
a north korean letter delivered tuesday said there was not 
enough time to hold a preliminary contact and then the full talks 
under the present condition where 40 days are left until the 
opening of the olympic games that must be debated as an urgent 
agenda item 
the olympic games start sept 17 in seoul and north korea has 
said it will boycott unless it can be cohost the international 
olympic committee refused that demand and said the olympics are 
awarded to a city not a country 
the letter from yang hyong sop chairman of the rubberstamp 
supreme peoples assembly called for a meeting in panmunjom on 
aug 17 that would be limited to discussing logistical 
arrangements with a first full parliamentary meeting to be held in 
its capital of pyongyang on aug 26 
south korean had called for detailed preliminary talks on 
working out an agenda for fullscale negotiations 
the north korean letter was addressed to south korean national 
assembly speaker kim chaesun and delivered at the border truce 
site of panmunjom 
the aug 17 meeting is expected to come off as proposed by the 
north but the overall picture of the situation is rather 
disappointing said one source at the national assembly who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
a few hours after the north korean letter was delivered 
political party leaders met and said they would send a reply by the 
end of this week 
lee dongbok chief secretary to the assembly speaker said 
after the meeting that a notable feature of north koreas letter is 
its stress on the inclusion of personages of various parties 
organizations and circles as full members of the proposed 
parliamentary talks 
the hankook ilbo a masscirculation national daily said any 
agreement can hardly be expected because north korea insists on 
including personages of parties organizations and circles 
pyongyangs reference to dissident groups in south korea 
sources in the national assembly said the tone of the north 
korean letter is not conciliatory and is rather rude in sharp 
contrast with north korean proposals in the past 
dialogue may be opened but the real fruit of the 
parliamentary talks can hardly expected the chosun ilbo an 
influential national newspaper said in a commentary 
hankook said north korea appears to be eager to find a new 
excuse to boycott the olympic games by making demands south korea 
can hardly accept 
both papers noted that north korea said the talks were urgent 
while proposing aug 17 as a meeting date south korea had earlier 
suggested a meeting begin aug 11 
the papers also noted that the date is two days after aug 15 
when south korean radical students plan to march to the border for 
talks with north korean youths on national unfication 
it is obvious that all this is intended to stir unrest in our 
society hankook said 
south korea fears the north may use terrorism to try and disrupt 
the olympics north korea was implicated in the nov 29 bombing of 
a south korean airliner with the deaths of all 115 people aboard 
most observers believe there is little chance north korea will 
drop its demand to be cohost of the olympics and agree to take 
part such a change would represent a total turnabout after 40 
years of bitter rivalry 
north korea sees the holding of the olympics in seoul as a major 
political defeat since both sides claim to be the sole legitimate 
government on the korean peninsula 
north korea invaded south korea in 1950 to start the korean war 
the two sides technically remain at war since no peace treaty was 
signed when an armistice halted fighting in 1953

work went on uninterrupted tuesday in a 
copper mine complex despite a call by the industrys official union 
for a brief wage protest there 
there were conflicting explanations on why the protest did not 
take place and about recent developments at the rudna mine 
government officials said the protest was called off by leaders 
of the local officially recognized copper union after they 
received a telegram from the industry ministry proposing talks 
officials of the banned solidarity trade union which had urged 
workers to ignore the call said miners simply refused to go along 
with the protest 
solidarity officials asked miners to reject the call because the 
protest focused on wage issues and not safety demands which the 
banned union maintains are at the core of disputes with mine 
management 
government spokesman jerzy urban said tuesday the official union 
called off the protest after receiving the ministry telegram 
local solidarity spokesman jan sugalski said the official union 
had gone ahead with the protest action trying to turn off conveyor 
belts to force a work stoppage sugalski said miners refused to 
carry out the orders 
the local copper workers union part of the national federation 
of trade unions on monday distributed an appeal calling for a 
oneto twohour work stoppage in the copper mining industries of 
lower silesia said solidarity advisor jacek kuron 
kuron said the official unions failure to mention safety 
conditions amounted to an attempt to thwart solidarityled efforts 
to bring changes to the industry 
he said the wage issue is secondary to safety demands because 
management has shown a willingness to meet pay demands 
the action by the official union appeared designed to head off 
protests by solidarity supporters at the rudna mine outside the 
town of lubin 
an independent mining commission at the rudna mine has charged 
that miners must work at temperatures that exceed industry norms 
the miners have given management until aug 15 to adhere to an 
earlier agreement to improve working conditions 
they threatened protest actions if management did not comply

montanas fish and game commission has 
adopted emergency fishing regulations to help preserve trout 
endangered by dwindling water in many droughtravaged streams and 
rivers 
the commissions action is a good start said stan bradshaw 
spokesman for the montana chapter of trout unlimited its a 
recognition at least that times are tough 
in a related action the commission agreed with a department of 
fish wildlife and parks proposal to make more antelope deer and 
elk permits available this year in many hunting districts 
a low harvest last year combined with droughtwithered forage 
available for this winter convinced the commissioners that hunters 
should be given a chance to harvest game before the animals starve 
the fishing restrictions which take effect friday and will last 
at least through february apply to most trout streams east of the 
rocky mountains and a few in western montana the commission said 
monday 
department of fish wildlife and parks personnel said this is 
the first time the commission has been forced to take emergency 
steps to deal with a droughts impacts on fisheries 
most seriously affected by the changes will be the central 
fishing district where limits will be reduced from five trout to 
two trout on most waterways 
most of the rivers and streams in the district are at or near 
record low flows for this time of year pat graham chief of the 
department of fish wildlife and parks fisheries division told 
the commission the situation is bad and getting worse and we 
have to do what we can to protect the states wild trout fishery 
at this point rain is not going to solve the problem if more 
trout begin to die as a result of the low stream flows and high 
water temperatures the detrimental impacts on the fisheries will 
be apparent for several years 
graham noted that his agency does not stock streams with 
hatchery fish so the imposition of emergency restrictions is the 
only way we can offer protection to the wild trout in these streams 
that will spawn in the fall and spring 
we depend on wild rainbow and brown trout to maintain our fish 
populations graham said 
if water levels continue to decline fishing bans in key 
spawning areas may be requested at the commissions september 
meeting he warned

the us catholic conference said today it 
will urge catholics not to see the film the last temptation of 
christ while two fundamentalist preachers complained they were 
turned away from screenings 
the conference rated the film morally offensive to the 
nations 53 million catholics and said it was theologically flawed 
although a memo to the bishops said the film is clearly 
contrary to the teachings of the church it said public protests 
against the film would give the film further publicity 
the two protestant preachers the revs donald wildmon and jerry 
falwell have been critical of the film although neither has seen 
it 
an 18member of the catholic group saw the film at a screening 
monday the buffalo ny news reported today 
directed by martin scorsese the film depicts jesus as someone 
who is tempted to resist what christians believe is his divinity 
until the point of death on the cross jesus hallucinates during a 
dream sequence in the movie that he marries and has sex with mary 
magdelene 
in the face of protests from religious groups universal 
pictures announced the film based on a novel by the greek author 
nikos kazantzakis would open friday more than a month ahead of 
schedule the studio has been previewing the film this week 
the cast includes willem dafoe platoon as jesus barbara 
hershey hannah and her sisters as mary magdalene and rock 
star david bowie as pontius pilate 
in the memo released in washington the conference said the 
movie dwells on sexual rather than spiritual love and contains 
excessive graphic violence 
the conference suggested the church use the issuance of the film 
as an opportunity to place before our people again the true image 
of christ 
universal turned down a request by wildmon a united methodist 
minister who heads the american family association in tupelo 
miss to see a preview scheduled to be held in new york today the 
ministers group said it also withdrew an invitation to falwell 
for a wednesday screening there according to a falwell spokesman 
wildmon was turned away because you have chosen to speak out 
against mca inc and universal pictures with regard to the film 
without seeing it and because you rejected our earlier offer to 
see the film on july 12 said a letter from universal 
the studio noted falwells criticism in withdrawing its 
invitation to him said falwell spokesman mark demoss the former 
moral majority leader has joined other ministers in calling for a 
boycott of mca and its subsidiaries 
wildmon refused monday to apologize for condemning the film and 
accused the studio of hypocrisy

rangoon the australian said he saw six armored cars and up to 20 
truckloads of troops heading for the capital 
jim hanson a 25yearold american said most stores were closed 
and no buses ran there was a lot of public support for the 
demonstrators he said 
another tourist said people in some homes cooked food for the 
protesters 
a western diplomat in bangkok said speaking privately this 
is a tragedy our reports say the crowds have been very 
conciliatory towards security forces things are going from bad 
to worse 
the demonstrations which began to spread beyond rangoon on 
monday are by far the largest show of protest since democracy was 
ended in this southeast asian nation by a military coup in 1962 
that brought ne win to power 
sein lwin a former general became president and head of the 
ruling party when ne win stepped down last month students accuse 
him of the bloody suppression of riots in march and june 
diplomats said most protests in rangoon have occurred at the 
sule pagoda and maha bandoola square downtown and at the hilltop 
shwedagon pagoda in the northern suburbs 
burmese embassies have tried to screen out journalists applying 
for tourist visas the associated press has been unable to enter 
the country and its rangoon correspondent sein win was arrested 
last month along with several critics of the government 
travelers from rangoon in recent days have quoted burmese as 
saying sein lwin was the most hated man in the country 
ne win had full support from the officer corps but most 
analysts believe loyalty to sein lwin is only partial some feel 
that could have more bearing on burmas future than riots by 
unarmed students

reagan ii the movie is already causing some 
concern for networks that got caught in a film controversy at the 
republican national convention four years ago 
despite some grumbling after this years democratic national 
convention in atlanta the three big networks will give the 
republicans equal time for the fourday gop convention next week in 
new orleans though with smaller staffs 
a filmed tribute to the outgoing president is on the program 
monday and vice president george bush the expected nominee will 
be featured in another film thursday 
im still waiting for something definitive from the party on 
the length said joe angotti executive producer of nbcs 
convention coverage there is a reagan film which i dont feel 
obligated to carry because reagan is not a candidate 
when reagan was a candidate in 1984 the three networks parted 
company on carrying the 18minute promotional film shown to the 
convention nbc and cnn carried it all abc carried excerpts and 
cbs used the time during the film to show its own report on the 
reagan administrations successes and failures 
this time cbs may cover the film as a news story using the 
journalistic standards we use for other stories executive 
producer lane venardos said from new orleans 
well have to see it before deciding said jeff gralnick 
executive producer for abc 
at the democratic convention cbs decided not to carry a 
sixminute film about presidential nominee michael dukakis filling 
the time with commentary and a commercial abc nbc and cnn all 
carried that film 
as of monday it wasnt even certain how long the reagan and 
bush films would run venardos said he had been told that reagans 
film ran 18 minutes and bushs 12 minutes while angotti said he 
had been told that each ran about 20 to 25 minutes 
during the democratic convention abc news president roone 
arledge had complained that the carefully orchestrated proceedings 
were driving people at home not to watch and raised the 
possibility of cutting back coverage of the gop event 
however abc will join nbc and cbs in giving the republicans an 
equal twohour block of prime time monday through thursday from 9 
to 11 pm edt the republicans have scheduled some nights to run 
past 11 pm including the roll call which will nominate bush as 
the partys presidential candidate 
venardos said cbs will stay with the roll call at least until 
bush has secured the nomination which is expected to be when 
texas casts its votes 
that is really why we are here venardos said i think 
viewers care a lot about seeing and hearing their home state 
i think you have to play these things by ear angotti said 
the more you say in advance about what you might do or not do 
the more trouble you get into 
from this vantage point i will say exactly what i said before 
atlanta our plans are for 911 pm we havent seen a schedule 
which tells us what we need to know to make precise plans 
gralnick said 
all three networks will use fewer people to cover the 
republicans than they deployed in atlanta and all said thats at 
least partly because republicans have no one comparable to jesse 
jackson who was still in the presidential race in atlanta and made 
noises about challenging for the vicepresidential slot 
abc is cutting 100 from its staff cbs is paring 50 and nbc 
plans to cut 25 to 30 they will still send hundreds 
we had more delegate reporters last time than we are going to 
have here angotti said from new orleans were going to rely 
more with our affiliates who are with the delegations to come up 
with whatever news there is 
venardos said the smaller staff also reflected things we 
learned to do more efficiently in atlanta it wasnt so much 
coverage as how to schedule people more efficiently 
abc is economizing by not taking nightline to new orleans 
and is using one control room instead of two 
its due to the fact that its a onecandidate convention 
gralnick said there are fewer hotels to cover fewer candidate 
possibiliies less of a breaking news situation than in atlanta 
cable news network plans no cut in its staff of nearly 300 said 
network spokesman kitsie bassett and no reduction in coverage time 
which extended nearly 70 hours during the democratic convention 
cnn will go live at 11 am monday for the first convention 
session 
with the presidential nomination locked up the bush campaign is 
banking on the vice presidency to boost ratings bush has said he 
will not announce his choice until the conventions final day 
im for doing anything that will help build a tv audience 
lee atwater bushs campaign manager said monday 
the democratic convention was watched on average by less than 
a fourth of the nations homes with television nbc did best with 
an average rating of 74 while abc had 69 cbs had 65 and cnn 
had an average of 20 for the evening primetime hours 
each rating point represents 1 percent of the nations 886 
million homes with tv

soviet officials tuesday began 
counting us cruise missiles at two sites in belgium as part of 
inspections allowed under the superpower arms treaty 
the first team of 10 soviet inspectors arrived by bus at the 
european repair facility at gosselies about 30 miles south of 
brussels to check missiles at a maintenance site 
they paused for photographs and then went quickly into a 
onestory building that is part of the operations run by the 
belgian defense contractor sabca 
its a straightforward kind of process said us embassy 
spokesman james findley this is beancounting going in and 
looking at what the treaty says are limited and figuring it out 
the soviets he said would have a chance to measure unarmed 
cruise missiles removed from their canisters for repair or 
maintenance 
they may take special measurements and check because this is 
the only place they can do it findley said 
there was no indication how many missiles were at the facility 
the only one of its kind in europe set up to maintain and repair 
the weapons 
the number can vary daily on june 21 there were 55 missiles at 
the plant according to us officials 
a second team of 10 inspectors went to florennes air base 10 
miles north of the repair facility 
sixteen groundlaunched cruise missiles and four spares are kept 
at the base along with four launchers and eight spares according 
to us officials 
the sleek groundhugging weapons which arrived in march 1985 
are jetpropelled winged missiles with advanced guidance systems 
they are 21 feet long 
the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty provides the soviet 
union and the united states with unprecedented review of each 
others facilities 
the soviets are visiting 30 sites in the united states and five 
western european countries us experts are inspecting 133 sites 
in the soviet union and eastern europe 
each inspection can last up to 24 hours with a possible 
eighthour extension 
the soviet experts who arrived monday spent the night in a 
brussels hotel and notified authorities tuesday that they wanted to 
inspect the two sites 
they were expected to spend tuesday night at the facilities and 
return to brussels on wednesday they will leave belgium later 
wednesday or thursday 
the soviets were taken on a twohour bus tour of the historic 
capital with us air force lt col david macnamee he said they 
expressed interest in the gothic and baroque architecture 
belgium is the fourth western european country visited by the 
soviet teams since the 60day inspection process began july 1 they 
have visited germany britain and the netherlands they have yet to 
inspect sites in italy 
the treaty provides for elimination within three years of all 
us and soviet landbased missiles with ranges from about 300 to 
3400 miles president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev signed the treaty in december in washington

the nations governors after three days of 
harmony closed out their annual meeting tuesday with an 
acrimonious debate over whether to change the method of amending 
the us constitution 
present but not participating in that debate was gov michael 
dukakis of massachusetts the democratic presidential nominee who 
attended only the final session of the 80th meeting of the national 
governors association 
the massachusetts governor sat silent while govs john sununu of 
new hampshire and mario cuomo of new york buddy roemer of lousiana 
and carroll campbell of south carolina dropped all pretense of 
harmony 
youve turned the constitution on its head said roemer 
when sununu presiding over the final session of his year as nga 
chairman suggested to cuomo that they debate the issue on 
television the new york governor replied i know how eager you 
are for the cameras red light governor sununu 
and i know how eager you are to avoid it retorted sununu 
there was minimal debate and no roll call votes as the governors 
quickly approved policy positions on issues ranging from housing 
and jobs to transportation and tourism 
also approved on a voice vote was a call by the governors to 
congress to consider amending the constitution to provide that if 
34 states agreed on a constitutional amendment it would be 
submitted to congress which could block it by a twothirds vote or 
send it back to the states for ratification 
currently amendments may be proposed by a vote of twothirds of 
each house of congress or by a national convention called by 
congress amendments become part of the constitution after 
ratification by legislatures of threefourths of the states or by 
conventions in threefourths of the states congress decides which 
form of ratification should be used state legislatures or 
conventions are given seven years in which to ratify most 
amendments 
many state legislatures have adopted resolutions calling for a 
constitutional convention to consider an amendment to require a 
balanced federal budget but the number has fallen short of that 
required to force convening of a convention 
after the voice vote approving the proposal dealing with 
constitutional amendments gov roy romer of colorado said the 
proposal divisive and contentious and asked sununu to refer it 
to the nga executive committee for further consideration 
the discussion grew a little more heated when cuomo conceding 
he had not objected before the vote denounced the proposal as a 
halfbaked notion 
cuomo had not attended the first three days of the conference 
and campbell noted that some of us have been here for the entire 
conference some of us came in only for the last show 
the debate finally was resolved when sununu suggested that all 
governors put their views of the proposal in writing and promised 
to attach them to the resolution when it was submitted to congress 
dukakis took part in a light moment at the close of the meeting 
when he and gov bill clinton of arkansas stepped to the podium to 
make a presentation to gov thomas kean of new jersey who will be 
the keynote speaker at the republican national convention next week 
in new orleans 
throughout the nga meeting governors needled clinton about his 
overly long speech at the democratic convention 
dukakis turned to kean and presented him with a plastic shopping 
bag and said just in case you have the same kind of problem he 
clinton did we thought you might want to take this 
inside the bag was an hour glass

in the aegean sea but will join another alliance exercise in 
western europe the government said tuesday 
according to the governments firm policy greek forces do not 
take part in nato exercises in the aegean said government 
spokesman sotiris kostopoulos 
he said greece wont participate in the display determination 
88 maneuvers in the eastern mediterranean this fall 
but greece will take part in the autumn forge 88 exercises 
since our armed forces do participate from time to time in 
bilateral and multilateral technical exercises on a smaller scale 
being carried out outside the aegean kostopoulos said 
since 1981 greece has refused to participate in nato exercises 
in the aegean saying the alliance favors turkey by excluding the 
greek island of lemnos from the exercise scenarios 
turkey claims that lemnos should not be militarized citing the 
1923 lausanne treaty greece maintains the 1936 montreux convention 
superseded the earlier treaty and allows military installations on 
the northern aegean island 
greece and turkey have a long feud over military control of the

a consumer group accused oil companies tuesday 
of pocketing the savings from lower crude oil prices instead of 
passing them along to motorists in the form of lower gasoline 
prices 
instead of passing on lower prices to consumers major oil 
companies are increasing their profits said ed rothschild 
assistant director of the citizenlabor energy coalition 
edward murphy director of finance accounting and statistics 
for the american petroleum institute denied the charge 
the idea that the oil companies are colluding to keep the 
prices up is just pure garbage murphy said there is 
absolutely no evidence that that is the case 
the consumer group released a study of oil and gasoline prices 
compiled from a variety of sources including the energy information 
administration the labor departments bureau of labor statistics 
and oil daily 
oil companies reduced inventories at the beginning of the 
summer and kept gasoline production low in order to limit supplies 
and raise prices rothschild said 
he said that while the price of crude oil fell from 38 cents a 
gallon in january to 35 cents in july retail gasoline prices rose 
from 109 to 113 
rothschild added that many companies chose to emphasize 
production of their highest octane and most profitable gasoline 
which also had the effect of increasing prices 
murphy replied that there is always a lag between crude prices 
and the price charged at the pump gasoline prices didnt rise last 
year until two months or more after increases in crude costs he 
said and the same lag is occurring this year with crude oil 
declines 
murphy said that as of may 1 gasoline stocks totaled 225 
million barrels 10 million barrels lass that a year earlier but 
somewhat more than the two prior years

art appraisers stacey roman and phillip 
jelley were in town anyway for an auction of works from two failed 
banks so folks at the anchorage museum of history and art figured 
theyd use their services for a fundraiser 
for a 5 donation to the museum people were invited to bring in 
their family treasures monday and find out from the experts what 
they were really worth there were no major finds and a lot of 
disappointment as the appraisers spent five hours reviewing a host 
of objets dart but a few people learned their pieces were at 
least good buys 
roman said he mostly examined a lot of photo reproductions 
a lot of decorative pieces and said things like it would 
cost you more to get it framed than its worth 
he said he developed the phrase decorative piece because 
its better than telling somebody its a piece of junk just 
because it doesnt have a lot of value doesnt mean it doesnt have 
sentimental value 
roman and jelley work for the californiabased art auction house 
of butterfield amp butterfield and the main purpose of their visit 
is wednesday nights auction of a collection acquired by the 
federal deposit insurance corp as a result of its takeover of two 
failed alaska banks 
the collection includes a huge sydney laurence rendition of 
mount mckinley valued 180000 to 220000 and some other works 
valued at more than 10000 
literally its a treasure hunt roman said he is director 
of the auction houses painting department and his hope was to 
unearth paintings worth shipping to california for sale 
butterfield amp butterfield charges commissions ranging from 35 
percent for items that sell for 100 or less to 10 percent for 
pieces sold for 5000 or more 
basically my job is to look at beautiful things all day 
roman said and every day hope springs anew that someone will pull 
out of a plastic bag some amazing painting thats never been seen 
in 100 years 
but it was not to be monday 
jelley said he saw a nice little rug and a cast bronze bust 
but the only thing perhaps worth shipping to san francisco was a 
silver tea set he plans to research some more 
other items produced included a large parchment page of 
gregorian chant brought back from europe after world war ii whose 
owner believed it dated from the middle ages a hungarian mirror 
painting a religious scene purchased 21 years ago for 20 in a 
budapest antique shop and a sealed bottle of old mr boston 
straight rye whisky from the prohibition era 
the parchment it turned out was probably 19thcentury and not 
worth much 
but the hungarian mirror painting was definitely a good buy it 
would probably bring about 600 at auction jelley told its owner 
who had talked her way past hungarian border guards when they 
questioned whether she should be allowed to take the painting out 
of their country 
the whiskey too had no value at auction because while wine can 
be auctioned off it is against the law to auction hard liquor 
so what are jorene and shield downey going to do with grandmas 
medicinal pint preserved so carefully all these years 
our anniversary is on valentines day mrs downey said 
were going to drink it

the federal reserve board in a move to fight 
inflation said tuesday it was boosting its key bank lending rate 
for the first time in nearly a year analysts said other interest 
rates likely would head higher as a result 
with only three months left before the presidential election 
the board members all appointed by president reagan sent a 
dramatic signal that they were willing to push up interest rates to 
dampen inflationary pressures even at the risk of endangering vice 
president george bushs presidential aspirations 
the increase in the discount rate from 6 percent to 65 
percent was adopted by a 60 vote and took effect immediately it 
was the first change since sept 4 and put the rate at its highest 
in more than two years 
an increase in the discount rate which is the fee the fed 
charges for shortterm loans to member banks is the central banks 
most direct way of pushing interest rates higher as a curb on 
economic growth 
economists said jumps in other interest rates including those 
on mortgage rates and credit cards are likely to follow 
this will hit consumer pocketbooks fairly soon said david 
jones an economist with aubrey g lanston a government securities 
dealer in new york 
he said banks likely will raise their prime rate the interest 
they charge their most creditworthy commercial customers this week 
or next 
since may banks have raised their prime rate by a full point to 
95 percent the highest since march 1986 
and because more people are borrowing through home equity loans 
and adjustable rate mortgages which are tied to rate fluctuations 
consumers will feel the effects of the feds action much more 
rapidly than in previous years he said 
investors particularly foreign investors have been skeptical 
that the federal reserve would have the stomach to make such a move 
with the presidential election on the line 
however with this increase jones said i think the fed 
proved beyond any reasonable doubt that it does have a backbone and 
that it is willing to fight inflation even in an election year 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the administration was disappointed with the increase but he 
refrained from criticizing federal reserve chairman alan greenspan 
were always disappointed when interest rates go up but we 
understand there is a reason for it fitzwater told reporters 
we think the federal reserve has done a good job we think 
the feds on the right course 
the board in a statement said its decision reflects the 
intent of the federal reserve to reduce inflationary pressures 
consumer prices which rose 44 percent last year are expected 
to increase by more than 5 percent this year and perhaps more than 
6 percent next year analysts are predicting 
by making it more expensive to borrow money the fed hopes to 
check inflation by slowing consumer demand high employment is 
putting more dollars in the hands of consumers 
at the same time factories are operating at their highest 
capacity levels in eight years they are straining to produce 
enough goods for both domestic buyers and foreigners who have been 
buying more us products in response to the devaluation of the 
dollar through the end of last year 
the danger of accelerating inflation is present because too many 
dollars are chasing too few goods 
david wyss an economist with data resources inc a lexington 
mass consulting firm said the discount rate hike likely will 
push the value of the dollar which has been recovering since early 
this year still higher 
that eventually could choke off the improvement in the us 
trade deficit by making american products more expensive overseas 
he said 
prices on both the stock and bond markets fell after the feds 
announcement 
analysts had expected the fed to tighten its reins on the money 
supply this week but most were expecting the fed to make the less 
dramatic move of pushing up the federal funds rate the interest 
banks charge each other for overnight loans 
however the fed noted in its statement that the action it chose 
was taken in light of the growing spread of market interest rates 
over the discount rate 
since early march it had pushed the federal funds rate up by 
more than a percentage point to 775 percent while keeping the 
discount rate the same 
too great a spread between the rates tempts banks to try to 
misuse the discount window by borrowing from the fed and 
lending to other banks at a profit 
tuesdays discount rate increase was the second rate hike since 
greenspan became fed chairman a year ago in september the central 
bank boosted the rate from 55 percent to 6 percent the first 
increase in three years 
that move also was taken in response to inflationary fears but 
was later cited by some analysts as a contributing factor to the 
october stock market crash 
after the crash the fed loosened money supplies again in 
midwinter when rising business inventories raised concern that the 
economy was softening 
since then however government statistics have portrayed a 
strong economy and concern has shifted from recession to inflation 
prior to september the last increase in the discount rate had 
come april 6 1984 when the rate was boosted from 85 percent to 9 
percent 
the rate was then cut seven successive times with the last 
reduction on aug 20 1986 when it dropped from 6 percent to 55 
percent the lowest level in nearly a decade

a state board today assumed control of the 
citys finances and threatened defiant council members with 
criminal charges in an effort force them to accept a courtordered 
desegregation plan 
in short our goal is to save yonkers from itself said 
secretary of state gail shaffer head of the yonkers emergency 
financial control board the board voted 51 to impose a wage and 
hiring freeze and made council members who refuse to obey rules for 
fiscal responsibility subject to misdemeanor charges 
the four council members who voted against the desegregation 
plan ordered by us district judge leonard sand already are paying 
fines and face a threat of imprisonment beginning thursday on 
sands contempt of court citation 
the us 2nd district court of appeals today said it would rule 
on a city request to stay 500aday fines against the councilmen 
and bankrupting fines against yonkers the panel did not say when 
it would rule 
the control board established by gov mario cuomo earlier in 
the decade when yonkers came near bankruptcy has sweeping powers 
to control the budget of the states fourth largest city it could 
remove the councilmen from office 
city manager neil deluca cast the single negative vote because 
the control board is not strong enough at this time to avert 
fiscal disaster we may have to look to other entities to join me 
in resolving this issue 
mayor nicholas wasiscko who has called a council meeting for 
wednesday night said the only thing that will make any 
difference is the threat of removal from office 
sand fined the city 100 the first day doubling daily so that 
by day 22 the amount would have wiped out the citys 337 million 
budget deluca said the city would begin mass layoffs if the 
situation was not resolved by monday 
sand who in 1985 found the city liable for intentionally 
segregating its schools and housing over 40 years found the city 
and councilmen in contempt last week when the council voted 43 
against a resolution supporting the construction of 800 units of 
affordable housing throughout the city 
michael sculnick attorney for the city asked the appellate 
panel today to put the fines on hold pending a full appeal of 
sands contempt order because if they continued the city will be 
bankrupt in less than two weeks 
lawyers for the councilmen argued that sand had exceeded his 
authority by ordering passage of legislation that would implement 
the housing plan there are limits to a federal courts authority 
even to remedy an unconstitutional action said james d harmon 
attorney for councilman peter chema 
michael sussman attorney for the national assocation for the 
advancement of colored people contended that the appeals court had 
a duty to sand the dignity of the federal court is under 
assault said sussman by a group of citizens who think theyre 
above the law 
deluca who has pinpointed aug 21 as the last day the states 
fourth largest city can pay the price of defiance said if the 
appeals panel denied the stay he would write to sand asking him to 
grant a stay himself and initiate roundtheclock negotiations to 
resolve the crisis 
but deluca said the city has about 66 million cash on hand and 
the last day the city can pay a fine is aug 21 when the daily 
fine is 261 million but the cumulative fine would be 524 
million 
he said he still hoped cuomo would intervene or that one of the 
councilmen would change his vote 
sand had called for the governors assistance noting the 
governors power to remove elected officials cuomo has said he is 
reluctant to do that because it would be complicated and the city 
has appealed the contempt finding 
getting a councilman to change his vote would be difficult too 
because theyre all heroes now said deluca 
the four vice mayor henry spallone nicholas longo chema and 
edward fagan may face additional financial pressure if a citizens 
group goes ahead and files a 100 million civil suit against them 
for negligence dereliction of duty illegal conduct and waste 
thomas dickerson an attorney and vice president of citizens and 
neighbors organized to protect yonkers said the four councilmen 
had violated state law and the city charter by their actions and 
had caused the city irreparable harm publicly and financially

eight droughtplagued rivers set records for 
low water last month including alltime records in south carolina 
and wisconsin the us geological survey reported tuesday 
the north fork of the edisto river at orangeburg sc averaged 
141 million gallons of water per day for the month the least 
amount of water for any month ever measured in that river in 49 
years of recordkeeping 
and on july 15 the wisconsin river at muscoda wis recorded 
its lowest oneday flow ever at 12 billion gallons that river has 
been measured for 75 years 
six other rivers including the once mighty mississippi had 
their lowest flows for any july on record the survey reported 
even so july had fewer record lows than the 33 recorded in june 
rains have brought some spotty improvement in streamflows and 
reservoir levels around the country reported james ziglar 
assistant secretary of interior 
but he added the overall waterresources situation remains 
one of concern 
perhaps most striking the mississippi river itself pipeline 
for nearly half the streamflow in the united states set a new 
monthly low the lowest july in at least 54 years and at least 13 
percent lower than the record low set in june ziglar said 
flow in the mississippi at vicksburg miss averaged 108 
billion gallons per day during july 60 percent below the median 
for the month that flow broke the previous low record of 119 
billion gallons per day set in july 1934 
that also meant the mississippi remained the nations second 
largest river in july trailing the st lawrence which averaged 
159 billion gallons per day at massena ny that was 11 percent 
below normal for the st lawrence 
water flows for the remainder of the nations big five rivers in 
july were 754 billion gallons per day in the columbia river at the 
dalles ore 58 percent below normal 287 billion gallons a day 
in the missouri at hermann mo 41 percent below normal and 198 
billion in the ohio at louisville ky 38 percent below normal 
in addition to the record at vicksburg the mississippi as 
measured at keokuk iowa also set a record low for july at 106 
billion gallons a day 74 percent below normal 
besides the mississippi edisto and wisconsin rivers records 
for low july streamflows were set on 
the chippewa river at chippewa falls wis averaged 707 
million gallons a day 9 percent less than the record set in 1910 
the flow was 65 percent below normal for the month 
altahama river at doctortown ga was 74 percent below normal 
with a flow of 115 billion gallons per day lowest in 56 years of 
records 
the apalachicola river at chattahoochee fla was the lowest 
in 59 years of recordkeeping with an average of 38 billion 
gallons per day 
the sturgeon river at sidnaw mich recorded a flow of only 5 
million gallons per day lowest in 47 years and 90 percent below 
normal 
oconto river at gillette wis had its lowest july in 76 
years averaging 149 million gallons per day 47 percent below 
normal

the us embassy on tuesday rejected 
as false and slanderous a report that babies were sold to americans 
for adoption and then dismembered with their hearts and livers 
going to organ banks 
there does not exist the slightest evidence that any 
adopted infant from any part of the world has been used in that 
way the embassy said in a statement 
the statement followed news reports that police raiding a house 
last week found seven infants presumably born of brazilian 
mothers and several pregnant women who apparently intended to 
give their babies up for adoption 
the infants aged three months to six months were taken to a 
hospital police detained three men and a woman 
judge angel campos denounced the international trafficking 
of infants and speculated that some might be dismembered in the 
united states for their organs which could be sold for hundreds of 
dollars 
the embassy statement said a similar allegation was made in 1987 
by honduras secretarygeneral of social welfare leonardo villeda 
bermudez who subsequently acknowledged he had no proof 
the same allegation later cropped up in guatemala but that 
too was false the statement said alleging that communist 
newspapers were behind the rumor

a federal judge has ordered school officials 
to build a glassfront isolation booth inside a classroom so a 
6yearold who has aids can be taught with other children 
the box to measure at least 6 feet by 8 feet is to have a desk 
and a potty chair a sound system and a fulltime teachers aide 
us district judge elizabeth kovachevich said in her ruling 
monday she took into consideration the concerns of all involved in 
the case brought by the girls adoptive mother rosa martinez 
against the hillsborough county school board last september 
the judge expressed hope that once eliana martinez is able to 
see how her mentally handicapped schoolmates cope she will become 
toilettrained and learn not to habitually place her thumb and 
forefinger in her mouth 
once that happens the remote theoretical possibility that 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome could be spread to her 
classmates will be so slight that she must be allowed to sit in the 
classroom with her peers the judge ruled 
no aids cases have been proven to have been transmitted through 
exposure to urine feces or saliva even though the virus that 
causes the disease has been found in these bodily secretions the 
judge wrote 
steve hanlon elianas lawyer called the judges ruling 
creative and said he hoped that within six weeks of starting 
school aug 29 eliana will have progressed enough to leave the 
booth 
but a school official labeled the chamber idea sadistic and 
compared it to child abuse 
all i can do is see that little face in a bubble very close 
to other children but not able to take part in what the other 
children are doing said marion s rogers a member of the 
hillsborough county school board and a former teacher i think i 
feel that this is as close to child abuse as it can be 
sam rosales head of the classroom teachers association said 
tuesday that teachers who are aware of the ruling have had 
basically a positive attitude although slightly apprehensive 
of the judges decision he said i think she broke new 
ground but its still a middleofthe road ruling 
ms martinez wanted her daughter schooled with other trainable 
mentally handicapped children at manhattan exceptional center 
saying eliana needed the socialization and interaction 
the school district wanted eliana taught at home out of fear she 
could transmit the aids virus the girl has been in home 
instruction since june 1987 
sam rampello vice chairman of the school board said what 
the judge is asking us to do is unusual but were going to do it 
im not criticizing im not praising we have to take all the good 
and all the problems that come with it and all the consequences 
that come with it 
eliana is one of 500 children in a pilot pediatric aids program 
who have been treated with experimental drugs including azt 
kovachevich said elianas case of aids probably contracted from 
transfusions of contaminated blood after her premature birth in 
puerto rico is being held in check by the treatment 
kovachevich presided over the case brought by the three ray 
brothers in arcadia hemophiliacs who doctors believe were exposed 
to the virus through treatment with clotting agents from 
contaminated blood 
she ordered the brothers admitted to regular classes last year 
but after their house was burned they moved with their family to 
another district

church and temple bells tolled in nagasaki as 
thousands of people stopped in the streets tuesday to remember the 
moment 43 years ago when the united states dropped an atomic bomb 
on the japanese city 
the citys mayor urged the government to clarify whether us 
ships are bringing nuclear weapons into japan 
at 1102 am the moment when the bomb exploded in a burst of 
blinding light bells tolled as many people on the streets and in 
shopping centers paused for a minute of silence 
nagasaki became the target of the worlds second atomic attack 
on aug 9 1945 the united states dropped the first atomic bomb on 
hiroshima three days earlier japan surrendered about a week later 
to end world war ii 
at peace park near the point where the bomb exploded about 
20000 people gathered for an annual service under a hot sun 
people poured water over a memorial tablet to recall the cries of 
victims suffering from thirst and burns 
families presented a list of 2295 names of bomb victims who 
died during the past year bringing to 77462 the number of 
postwar victims of nuclear radiation their names are inscribed on 
a vault near the parks peace statue 
in the evening about 2000 roman catholics with candles walked 
through areas of the city once destroyed by the bombing a church 
official said 
officials estimate up to 70000 people died immediately from the 
explosion and the accompanying fire storms and radiation about 
70000 residents still suffer from side effects of the plutonium 
bomb doctors and social workers say 
in the bombing of hiroshima an estimated 70000 to 140000 
people died about 350000 people in japan hold certificates 
showing they were victims of the atomic bombings in the two cities 
since the war japan has followed a policy of three nonnuclear 
principles no possession manufacture or introduction into the 
country of nuclear weapons 
speaking at the ceremony in peace park nagasaki mayor hitoshi 
motoshima criticized his government for allowing us ships to dock 
in japan without verifying whether they carry nuclear weapons 
the japanese government should independently check whether 
us ships are carrying nuclear weapons when they call on japanese 
ports and make clear that it still is observing the three 
nonnuclear principles motoshima said 
the nagasaki bombing destroyed almost everything within a radius 
of more than half a mile including 1326 buildings and homes it 
also demolished 23500 homes and buildings outside that radius 
according to a report by the city 
the ancient port city of 450000 has been rebuilt with modern 
office towers and treelined avenues replacing the rubblestrewn 
landscape

a judge has given an amish man two weeks 
to perform five hours of community service or face a charge of 
criminal contempt for refusing to display a slowmovingvehicle 
sign on his horsedrawn buggy 
the charge could mean a 700 fine or up to 90 days in jail 
fillmore county district court judge o russell olsons ruling 
monday postponed action on a contempt charge stemming from dan d 
hershbergers failure to pay a 20 fine at an aug 29 hearing 
olson said he would determine whether hershberger performed the 
community service within the amish community 
theres no sense in getting into criminal contempt for 
nonpayment of a 20 fine the judge said 
minnesota law requires nonmotorized vehicles to display an 
orange sign outlined in red at night and to carry it at all times 
the amish who contend that displaying the bright signs is against 
their religion are allowed to use a black triangle outlined in 
white on their buggies and wagons during the daytime 
last year another judge ruled that hershberger violated a state 
law for not having the proper sign on his horsedrawn buggy 
the judge stayed imposition of a 20 fine on condition that 
hershberger not violate that law during the next six months 
but hershberger was arrested a second time and ordered to pay 
the fine he refused prosecutors in april charged him with 
criminal contempt of court a misdemeanor 
olson said he modified the original sentence to permit community 
service because that option had been available in other cases 
involving amish defendants

the teenage years are troubled times when 
many young people drink too much eat badly are prone to injury 
and violence and often consider suicide according to a survey 
released tuesday 
the data confirmed what many parents and counselors have long 
known or suspected the adolescent years can be dangerous 
dr robert e windom assistant health secretary and head of the 
public health service called the results somewhat dismaying 
the results give us fresh insight concerning what our nations 
teenagers know and how they act concerning health and sexrelated 
issues but they also show that too many young people even when 
they know better dont always make the right health decisions 
windom said in a statement 
the survey sponsored by health education groups and the 
department of health and human services polled 11000 
eighthgraders and 10thgraders during the fall of 1987 from a 
nationally representative sample of 217 public and private schools 
the margin of error was plus or minus 2 to 5 percentage points 
depending on the frequency of the behavior reported officials said 
in one of the more startling findings the study reported that 
26 percent of the eighthgraders and 38 percent of the 10thgraders 
said they had had five or more drinks on one occasion during the 
two weeks preceding the survey 
also 42 percent of the girls and 25 percent of the boys 
surveyed said they have seriously thought about committing 
suicide at some time in their lives nearly one in five girls and 
one in 10 boys of the total surveyed said they had actually tried 
to commit suicide 
w james popham president of iox assessment associates which 
conducted the survey said it was possible some teenagers 
exaggerated their responses but that the results were still 
frightening even if the figures were off by half 
i dont think they are off he said i really think a lot 
of kids in their modest way say its not worth it theres a 
consistent pattern of hopelessness of depression in some of the 
responses 
in the area of health the survey indicated that most teens 
understand that acquired immune deficiency syndrome or aids is 
transmitted by sexual intercourse and drug needles 
they also know that condoms are effective in helping avoid aids 
and believe they should be used but about half of the students 
were unsure or mistakenly believed that washing after sex reduces 
the chances of being infected 
the teens displayed ignorance about other sexually transmitted 
diseases the survey noted that 25 million teenagers are infected 
with such diseases each year and that many teens cannot identify 
common early signs of the infections 
a majority of those surveyed do not know that taking birth 
control pills is ineffective in avoiding these diseases more than 
a third said they would not know where to go for medical care if 
they caught a sexually transmitted disease 
the survey showed that many teens dont eat right even when they 
know they should nearly four of every 10 students said they eat 
fried foods four or more times a week the average student ate 
three snacks a day that were high in fat or sugar and 73 percent 
said they knew that eating such food may be related to heart 
problems or high blood pressure 
sixtyone percent of the girls and 28 percent of the boys said 
they had dieted during the past year and about half of the 
students who dieted used unsafe methods such as fasting others 
tried diet pills laxatives or vomiting 
unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death among 
people aged 15 to 25 with motor vehicle accidents accounting for 
more than 70 percent of accidental deaths the survey showed that a 
substantial portion of teenagers do not guard against such 
injuries 
about 56 percent of those surveyed said they did not wear a seat 
belt the last time they rode in a vehicle about 44 percent of 
10thgraders and 32 percent of eighthgraders said they had ridden 
during the past month with a driver who had used drugs or alcohol 
when they ride bicycles or motorcycles according to the survey 92 
percent said they never wear a protective helmet 
about half the boys and onefourth of the girls reported having 
been involved in at least one fight during the year preceding the 
survey nearly one in five girls reported that during the past year 
while outside of school someone tried to force them to have sex 
about onefourth of the boys said they have carried a knife to 
school at least once during the past year seven percent said they 
did so on a regular basis

the united states is prepared to provide 
logistical support to the united nations peacekeeping force that 
will monitor a ceasefire between iran and iraq to take effect aug 
20 the administration said tuesday 
shortly after the un security council approved the 
establishment of the 350member force state department spokeswoman 
phyllis oakley said none of the 15 council members would contribute 
troops to the force but we intend to be as helpful as we can 
the force will be funded out of un peacekeeping accounts 
through special assessments 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
administration welcomed the ceasefire announcement monday by un 
secretary general javier perez de cuellar and would bear its fair 
share of the cost of the observer force including transportation 
and equipment 
it is our understanding that there will be neither us nor 
soviet troops in the observer force he added 
it has been a major aim of the united states to bring this war 
to an end fitzwater said we now look forward to the 
implementation in all its parts of a un security council 
resolution calling for such a ceasefire 
mrs oakley expressed hope that the ceasefire would lead to 
rapid progress toward a final settlement and to the restoration of 
peace and security in the persian gulf region 
we strongly support the secretary generals call for both 
sides to exercise maximum military restraint until the ceasefire 
is in place she said 
the iraniraq situation was the subject of a meeting late monday 
involving deputy secretary of state john whitehead and an arab 
league delegation headed by saudi foreign minister saud alfaisal 
it was agreed by participants at the meeting that the states 
in the region have a vested interest in getting iran and iraq back 
on their feet said a us official insisting on anonymity 
earlier tuesday defense secretary frank c carlucci said the 
united states will withdraw most of its naval forces from the 
persian gulf only when it is convinced that the ceasefire has 
taken effect 
i would think wed have to wait until the ceasefire actually 
takes hold and probably after that a prudent period to make sure 
that it stays in effect carlucci said on nbctvs today 
program 
we have no desire to keep our ships our people there any 
longer than necessary at the same time we dont want to put them 
in any danger he said in a separate interview on cbs this 
morning 
the united states has maintained a force of close to 30 warships 
in the persian gulf to guard against attacks on oil tankers and 
other neutral shipping by iran and iraq since june 1987 many 
kuwaiti tankers have carried american flags and been protected in 
convoys of us naval ships 
more recently the us navy was ordered to protect all neutral 
shipping that comes under attack in the gulf 
the united states will probably maintain a presence of three to 
five ships in the region about what it has had there since the 
1940s but that depends on the threat carlucci said on cbs 
at the pentagon meantime chief spokesman dan howard said the 
us navy had completed its 54th convoy operation of the year early 
tuesday with the guidedmissile frigate nicholas escorting the 
reflagged kuwaiti tanker chesapeake city up the gulf to kuwait 
the journey was uneventful and there was no unusual air or sea 
activity reported howard said 
the spokesman said the defense department had not received any 
reports of fighting tuesday between iran and iraq either on land or 
water but added i do not have a definitive report that all 
hostilities have ceased i cant speak to that one way or another

democrat michael dukakis gave credit tuesday 
to president reagan for making progress with the soviet union and 
asserted that he and reagan are closer together on ussoviet 
issues than the president and george bush are 
its an administration thats growing dukakis said 
frankly theyre coming a lot closer to where i am 
dukakis the democratic presidential nominee offered qualified 
praise for reagans conduct of relations with the soviets 
including nuclear arms talks but he drew a distinction between 
reagans foreignpolicy positions and those of vice president bush 
who next week will become the republican presidential nominee 
he said bush who a day earlier called dukakis a stealth 
candidate who avoids tough issues had been unclear himself on 
many foreign policy questions 
i dont think bushs positions are clear on much of 
anything dukakis said 
i dont know do you know where he stands dukakis said to 
reporters i dont think anybody knows where he is on these 
things 
dukakis made his remarks to reporters aboard his campaign jet on 
a flight from boston to cincinnati where he joined his fellow 
governors for the final day of the national governors association 
meeting 
dukakis spoke only briefly during discussions at the governors 
conference and later met in private with democratic governors to 
discuss the fall campaign 
he also visited a housing redevelopment project in cincinnati to 
praise a resolution passed unanimously by the governors calling 
for the federal government to help states and cities expand the 
supply of affordable housing through housing grants and tax 
measures the resolution calls for a 28 billion increase in 
federal spending for housing through a variety of programs that 
would provide rent subsidies and address what dukakis called the 
problem of home ownership for young families 
washington must be a part of the solution and thats really 
what the governors have said today dukakis said 
dukakis on the flight to cincinnati was asked about a remark 
he made last week in california that it appeared peace is 
breaking out in various parts of the world he was asked whether 
he gave credit to reagan 
he called terrific recent ceasefire agreements in the 
regional conflict in angola and in the iraniraq war and gave 
credit to reagan for progress with the soviets 
the interesting thing is the president and i are closer 
together on ussoviet relations than he is with bush dukakis 
said 
the inf treaty eliminating mediumrange nuclear missiles from 
europe and reagans approach to the summit demonstrate a 
willingness on his part to explore closer relations with the soviet 
union dukakis said its to his credit 
dukakis also referred reporters to an interview published in 
tuesdays editions of the boston globe in it he said the 
president has spent two terms in office has grown his views have 
changed i applaud him for it i think one of the interesting 
questions that the vice president and i will be debating will be 
how it is that the president and i seem to be closer on this issue 
than he and the president 
on the plane dukakis cited reagans description of the soviet 
union as an evil empire during his first term and credited him 
with moving away from that belief 
heres an administration that five years ago was talking evil 
empire and now the president is walking arm in arm with gorbachev 
in red square he said 
dukakis had critical words however for the administrations 
policies in central america where dukakis opposes support for the 
nicaraguan contra rebels opposing that countrys sandinista 
government he said that was one issue on which bushs position was 
clear and was on the wrong side 
he called central american the one regional conflict where 
were missing an opportunity to work with people who want to work 
with us

irans acting commanderinchief hashemi 
rafsanjani said tuesday his nation is seeking a comprehensive 
peace but must remain vigilant in the face of iraqi mischief 
he reflected the relieved but wary mood on the streets of the 
warweary capital 
rafsanjani said iran wont initiate any military actions against 
iraq in light of the un secretarygeneral setting aug 20 as the 
ceasefire date in the war 
but he said that the soldiers should maintain their vigil 
against possible iraqi attacks 
the armed forces should not from today be the initiators of 
any kind of military and armed moves said rafsanjani who also 
is speaker of irans parliament in a statement read over tehran 
radio but just like always iran will be ready to give an 
appropriate response to the mischiefs of the enemy 
rafsanjanis message said that the islamic republic has 
decided to create a lasting and comprehensive peace in the region 
and will continue its path but that it is faced with enemies 
whose claims promises and agreements cannot be trusted 
he said the iraqis might resort to any agression and crime 
during the few days left until the ceasefire date and even after 
that 
islamic iran is proud before god for performing its holy duty 
of protecting justice and the iraqi baathists should answer god 
and the people as to why they kindled the fire of war and what tney 
gained from it rafsanjani said 
in the streets of tehran iranians greeted the announcement of 
the ceasefire date in the 8yearold iraqiran war with a sense of 
relief mixed with skepticism that it will mean lasting peace 
most learned that the shooting is to stop only at 7 am when 
the news came over tehran radio the announcement at the united 
nations in new york came to late for the principal morning 
newspaper jomhuri islami 
hopefully it means peace said a hotel employee in the laleh 
hotel the former intercontinental but celebrating after so 
many martyrs 
another englishspeaking man who introduced himself as a 
telephone operator was smiling broadly i just learned it 10 
minutes ago sure i will celebrate tonight with my family i will 
have a bottle of coke you know there is no drinking in our 
country 
in the sprawling bazaar the mood was still depressed among some 
who lost heavily in speculating on a further rise of the free 
dollar rate against the rial the dollar had dropped to almost one 
fourth of its value two months ago but seemed to have stabilized at 
about one third 
but most businessmen here think that things will be better in 
a few months and that peoples life will be much easier one 
merchant said 
a western diplomat who declined to be identified said 
expectations have been running high among residents after iraq 
accepted the ceasefire without precondition 
they will be disappointed normalization will take much 
time he said 
at a gas station where cars were filled up without having to 
wait a man said let us hope that this will hold that there 
will not be new fighting after two weeks 
the reaction was much more subdued than in iraq where people 
poured in the streets in the middle of the night to celebrate their 
victory and the government declared a threeday holiday 
a frenchspeaker who said he studied political science at 
tehran university before he joined the communications services 
said the americans will come back now i am sure i dont think 
it will take more than a few months 
but on the 15foot barbedwire topped walls surrounding the vast 
grounds of the former us embassy bold english and farsi writing 
painted years ago still boasted we will make america face a 
severe defeat

egypt and israel ended talks tuesday without 
reaching a compromise solution to a border dispute over taba a 
resort area on the aqaba gulf claimed by both countries officials 
said 
there has been no agreement on any of the subjects discussed 
during the daylong talks said nabil araby head of egypts 
delegation to an international arbitration body in geneva that is 
to settle the dispute over the 250acre area 
no further talks are planned and the israeli delegation was 
scheduled to fly home later in the day foreign ministry officials 
said 
taba which israel captured in its 1967 war with egypt was not 
returned after the 1979 peace treaty the two countries in 1986 
agreed to accept a final decision on the territory by a fivemember 
international panel in geneva the result of the arbitration is 
expected in september

department and abraham sofaer legal adviser to the us state 
department 
it was the fourth meeting between israel and egypt on the issue

including president hosni mubarak have emphasized that their 
countrys sovereignty over taba was not negotiable 
taba has a hotel and a tourist village both israeliowned and 
egypt has offered to buy them 
ben aharon in an aug 1 interview with newsweek magazine said

it a neutral zone and give both sides equal rights 
maher warned in an interview published monday in the cairo

suggestion during tuesdays talks this would signal the end of 
the meeting

nearly 7000 soviet troops have 
abandoned kandahar which used to be afghanistans secondlargest 
city leaving the devastated provincial capital in the hands of 
afghan forces diplomats said tuesday 
most of the 6750 red army troops were evacuated from kandahar 
by air aug 47 but a huge column of armor and heavy equipment 
continues to wind its way cautiously north through western 
afghanistan according to the reports 
western diplomatic sources in islamabad quoting witnesses said 
the last soldier an officer drove his jeep up to a waiting 
ilyushin76 transport plane walked up the ramp then tossed his 
keys back in the seat for the afghans to drive away 
kandahars population of 200000 has dwindled to 20000 in the 
10 years of war according to western estimates 
kabuls marxist government recently admitted that nearly 70 
percent of the citys buildings has been damaged or razed to the 
ground 
if moscow sticks to the withdrawal timetable set forth in the 
geneva accord signed in april half of its more than 100000 troops 
should be out of afghanistan by aug 15 
western diplomats quoting dispatches from kabul said kandahar 
has been left to 3000 young and apprehensive afghan troops to 
face continuing rocket and ground attacks by determined moslem 
guerrillas 
the kabul government has invited 50 foreign correspondents to 
the capital to witness the ceremonial withdrawal of the first 
kabulbased soviet units it marks the aug 15 halfway point of a 
total pullout from afghanistan to be completed by feb 15 
diplomats said the two departing 500man 100vehicle units are 
just a fraction of the 20000 soviet troops believed to be 
defending the heavily fortified city 
large units of soviet and afghan troops moved west into the 
paghman plains last week to dislodge 4000 mujahedeen insurgents 
who threatened to disrupt the aug 47 visit of soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze and the aug 15 pullout ceremonies 
diplomats said 
heavy fighting has cost about 100 lives on each side according 
to their estimates 
security was so tight during shevardnadzes stay that upon his 
departure his tu154 plane was protected by eight mi24 helicopter 
gunships plus jets above the cloud cover all dropping clusters of 
flares to ward off any guerrilla antiaircraft missiles 
witnesses said the plane corkscrewed eight times skyward in a 
steep climb before it reached a safe altitude to set a bearing for 
moscow 
western diplomatic sources said they believed his visit was to 
reassure afghan communists of the kremlins continued support and 
to report on his talks with pakistani foreign minister sahabzada 
yaqub khan whose country backs the guerrillas with washingtons 
help 
western pakistani and guerrilla sources predict kabuls 
communist regime will fall quickly in the absence of soviet 
military might

president reagan today announced he is 
nominating texas tech university president lauro cavazos to be 
secretary of education marking the first time a hispanic has ever 
been named to the cabinet 
this is a proud day for all americans reagan said in 
announcing the selection of cavazos to succeed education secretary 
william bennett who had announced earlier this year that he would 
not serve throughout the remainder of reagans term 
its hard right at this moment to think of a more exciting 
moment said reagan who appeared in the white house briefing 
room with bennett and cavazos 61 
asked whether he had selected cavazos because of his heritage 
reagan said i didnt even ask him that reagan said he 
selected cavazos because he was the bestfitted man to succeed 
bennett 
vice president george bush in a speech to the league of united 
latin american citizens in dallas last july 6 had pledged to name 
a hispanic to the cabinet if he were elected to succeed reagan 
asked today if he had allowed bush to influence the decision 
reagan replied no im just still working at the job here 
bennett said he was ready to turn over to cavazos the apple 
the pencil and the key to the cabinet officers door 
reagan called cavazos a distinguished educator 
with his administrative skills and his many accomplishments in 
the field of education dr cavazos is an ideal selection for this 
cabinet post the president said 
his commitment to the profession of teaching and to excellence 
in education and his belief in getting back to basics and things 
like homework and above all his emphasis on education of special 
importance to americas minorities are messages i hope he will 
sound far and wide across the nation reagan said 
this job has had its thrills during the past 91 months and 
not a few of those experiences ive shared with you in this room 
he said but its hard right now to think of a more exciting 
moment than this one and the knowledge that dr cavazos will be 
the first hispanicamerican member of the cabinet he said 
that says a lot about him and about americans of hispanic 
heritage it also says something about america america as a place 
of opportunity and hope he said 
cavazos is a native of south texas and the son of a foreman of 
the santa gertrudis division of the huge king ranch 
he has served as president of texas tech since 1980 while also 
heading the texas tech university health and sciences center he 
was the first texas tech graduate and first hispanic to hold those 
two posts 
previously he was a member of the faculty of tufts university 
school of medicine as professor of anatomy and earlier had taught 
at the medical college of virginia 
reagan also used the occasion to pay tribute to bennett calling 
the departing cabinet secretary the best thing to happen to 
american education 
in early may bennett said he would resign in september to 
return to private life 
bennett made headlines throughout his tenure with acerbic 
criticisms of teacher unions school bureaucracy colleges raising 
tuitions twice as fast as inflation and the jim crow math and 
backofthebus science meted out to black children in ghetto 
schools he called chicagos schools the nations worst and said 
that system was in an educational meltdown

a federal judge who was chastised by a 
higher court for showing bias in favor of ku klux klansmen in a 
race violence case has offered to ban himself from litigation 
involving the federal government 
but so far us district judge william m acker jr 60 has 
not drawn any public call for such blanket disqualification 
acker appointed to the bench by president reagan in 1982 
scheduled a hearing on the issue for friday 
us attorney frank donaldson on tuesday filed a response on 
behalf of the government in which he said the united states has 
at this time insufficient information to determine and no reason to 
believe that judge ackers proposed general recusal is either 
necessary or appropriate 
donaldson who said the justice department will not be 
represented at the hearing said it is the governments view that 
the matter of recusal is better left for consideration on a 
casebycase basis 
ackers rulings against the justice department in the klan 
litigation prompted the 11th us circuit court of appeals to 
remove him from the case in a bluntly worded order 
during the course of this litigation wrote 11th circuit 
judge frank m johnson of montgomery judge ackers position has 
become hardened against the government and he has evidenced a 
commitment that clearly reflects that he is no longer able to view 
these cases impartially 
acker had ruled that the actions of several klansmen accused of 
violating the civil rights of marchers in a violent confrontation 
at decatur in 1979 did not justify what acker said were improper 
tactics used by the southern poverty law center in montgomery 
which acker branded a countervigilante group 
the center had sued the klansmen then gave their testimony to 
the justice department which used it to obtain indictments against 
them acker ruled the testimony inadmissible evidence and then did 
not follow 11th circuit instructions to admit it as evidence 
morris dees director of the center said his organization would 
take no position on ackers qualifications to preside over 
government cases 
dees whose center over nearly two decades has handled a number 
of highly publicized civil rights and death penalty cases said 
center attorneys will not attend fridays hearing 
weve never had any experience with judge acker in any other 
case dees said 
kenneth j gomany one of the attorneys for the klansmen said 
he plans to attend the hearing to submit any kind of briefs in 
support of the judge 
i think he is a good and fair judge and hes ruled against our 
clients and against the government on occasion more often than 
not hes ruled against our clients all in all hes been 
impartial said gomany 
this court is neither seeking praise nor condemnation acker 
wrote in june when he scheduled the hearing but feels it is 
necessary that it create a forum for frank and serious discussion 
of a very serious subject namely should a judge whose position 
is hardened against the government sit on the governments cases 
 
ackers clerk said she was not aware of any briefs filed in 
advance of the hearing 
the controversy began in 1979 in decatur when a march by the 
southern christian leadership conference ended in a bloody 
confrontation with klansmen who beat police with clubs when 
officers tried to keep them away from the marchers shots were 
exchanged and several people were injured none fatally 
an initial justice department investigation ended without 
indictments but the southern poverty law center filed a civil 
action against 50 klansmen seeking financial damages and bans on 
klan actions 
the center took testimony from klansmen then made it available 
to federal investigators who used it to obtain indictments against 
nine klansmen in 1984 acker however blocked the testimony 
saying it was inadmissible in the governments case 
acker said the klan is a vigilante group which undoubtedly 
from time to time violates the constitutional rights of citizens 
however one vigilante group does not justify the creation and 
operation of a countervigilante group in violation of the 
constitutional rights of the first group 
to tolerate a rape of the rights of the klan would be a 
recognition that some sort of double standard exists for the 
application of constitutional protections he said 
the government appealed and the 11th circuit ruled that the 
testimony should not be suppressed 
the 11th circuit ordered ackers removal from the case when the 
government filed a second appeal arguing that he had failed to 
follow the circuit courts directions

only 44 percent of the nations 11000 
physicians who perform artificial insemination test the donated 
semen for the aids virus according to an office of technology 
assessment study released tuesday 
the study said that about 65000 babies conceived by artificial 
insemination were born in the united states last year semen for 
more than 30000 of those babies was provided by anonymous sperm 
donors the report by the congressional agency said 
in a survey of 367 doctors who have at least four artificial 
insemination patients a year only 44 percent or about 161 said 
they test donors for evidence of the aids virus the report said 
some doctors however reject semen if the donor is considered 
at risk of being infected with aids of the doctors surveyed 16 
percent said they rejected donors due to homosexual contacts 13 
percent for intravenous drug use 12 percent for multiple 
heterosexual contacts and 6 percent just for residency in an area 
where aids is common 
homosexuality promiscuous sexual contact and iv drug use are 
all considered risk factors for contracting acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome 
the study said 28 percent of the surveyed doctors tested sperm 
donors for syphilis 27 percent for gonorrhea 26 percent for 
hepatitis 23 percent for chlamydia and 6 percent for herpes 
fifteen surveyed sperm banks which collect and store semen for 
use under the direction of doctors said they screen donor semen 
for aids although one sperm bank said the test was performed 
only if the donor were considered to be from a high risk group 
there have been no confirmed reports of women infected with aids 
from donated semen but in two locations semen from men later found 
to have aids has been used for artificial insemination the report 
said in canada and austrialia the study says there have been 
several women who were exposed to aids from insemination of 
infected semen 
the food and drug administration and the federal centers for 
disease control recommended last february that all donated semen be 
frozen and quarantined for at least six months this would enable 
the semen donors to be tested for aids a disease that may not show 
up in blood tests for months after the sperm is infective 
the ota study however showed that 22 percent of the surveyed 
physicians used only fresh semen usually from the husband or 
partner of the woman of the frozen semen used 75 percent had a 
quarantine period generally of three months the report said 
in general the report said commercial sperm banks were more 
likely to screen donors effectively for infertility aids and 
genetic defects than were individual physicians 
about 20 percent of the women requesting artificial insemination 
are turned down by the physicians the study said over half the 
doctors said they reject unmarried women or those whom they 
consider psychologically immature 
almost all of the doctors said they were willing to match the 
womans specifications for donors race eye color and body type 
and a majority also would match specifications for educational 
attainment intelligence quotient and religion 
artificial insemination is a procedure whereby sperm is inserted 
into the vagina or uterus by syringe or other artificial means the 
technique is commonly used for women whose husbands are sterile or 
whose husbands semen requires processing to enhance the chances of 
conception unmarried women also request artificial insemination 
the report said 
aids is caused by a virus that can be transmitted through blood 
products or sperm aids kills by attacking the victims immune 
system making them susceptible to disease and some types of 
cancer there have been no known cases of full recovery from aids 
infection

us officials saw no signs during last 
weeks trip to moscow of a reduction in soviet military forces or 
spending despite soviet assurances of a new defense policy an 
american official said monday 
the official who accompanied us defense secretary frank 
carlucci on the trip but who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
it does not seem to us evident yet that there is any change in 
force structure or resources that the soviets are committing to 
their military effort 
the official was in brussels to brief the north atlantic council 
on carluccis four days of talks with soviet defense minister 
dmitri t yazov and unprecedented tours of secret soviet military 
bases the council the highest decisionmaking body of the north 
atlantic treaty organization is made up of representatives of the 
16 countries in the alliance 
the us official told reporters the americans discussed the 
soviets socalled defensive doctrine under which emphasis would 
be placed on defending territory rather than seizing or holding it 
when we look at their forces he said the things that 
bother us for example is their heavy emphasis on tanks 
artillery engineer bridging units and airborne forces 
he said these are the type of troops that would be used to grab 
territory 
now he said the soviets say they are changing to a 
defensive doctrine and they dont have that objective we made 
clear to them that we must pay attention specifically to what their 
capabilities are 
we would welcome seeing changes away from those kinds of 
forces that would help us relieve our concerns about the offensive 
capabilities of the soviet army he said 
he did say however that soviet officials provided some 
evidence that military exercises seem to be shifting to 
reflect the new doctrine 
we dont dismiss the utility of that or changes of that kind 
on the soviet side he said 
soviet authorities also told their american counterparts they 
were putting together a better accounting of their defense 
spending the official said 
we dont have anything concrete as to whether or not they are 
in fact applying less resources to the military or not right now 
he said we dont see evidence of that in terms of what you can 
see in their own production output and other efforts 
he said soviet officials did not dispute us estimates that 
moscow spends 15 percent to 17 percent of its economic output on 
the military us defense spending amounts to about 6 percent of 
the gross national product the total value of goods and services 
produced by the economy 
the official said the two delegations also discussed ways to 
prevent accidental shootings or other serious incidents between the 
two countries forces during peacetime in 1985 a us military 
observer was shot and killed in east germany while making what 
american authorities said was a proper tour of the area 
the first meeting of a working group on preventing such 
incidents was scheduled to meet in the fall the official said no 
date or place has yet been set 
this was the third meeting between carlucci and yazov they met 
last march in switzerland and again at the moscow summit in june 
the us official said the united states was not expecting 
dramatic changes in its military ties with the soviet union 
it would be i think unfounded to anticipate a sea change in 
our relationships with them in the military area he said 
these discussions in and of themselves do not change the 
security situation that we have to face we find no grounds in 
these contacts we have had for unilaterally altering our military 
structure or our defense posture or the need for readiness or 
defense spending

up to onethird of all recent retirees may be 
getting substantially shortchanged on their social security checks 
because of discrepancies in government records a union 
representing federal workers said tuesday 
a recently announced plan by the social security administration 
and the internal revenue service to correct the records is a 
cruel hoax and a charade kenneth l blaylock president of the 
american federation of government employees told two house ways 
and means subcommittees 
the union represents 700000 workers including 60000 at the 
social security administration 
government auditors agreed that the chances of clearing up 
discrepancies of past years look bleak 
however the irssocial security agreement should result in 
more employees social securitycovered earnings being properly 
reported to and recorded by ssa said joseph f delfico senior 
associate director of the general accounting office 
blaylocks account of the extent of the records problem was 
considerably worse than estimates by gao auditors 
the gao the investigative arm of congress estimated the 
problem could cost about 10 million beneficiaries an average of 17 
a month the union put the number of affected retirees as high as 
40 million and estimated the loss at up to 50 a month 
the problem grows out of the dual reporting of employee earnings 
by employers once a year to the social security administration and 
once a quarter to the irs 
for a variety of reasons those reports do not always match 
between 1978 and 1984 employers reported 588 billion less to 
social security than they did to the irs 
as a result the irs has turned over to social security trust 
funds more than 77 billion in payroll taxes that are not credited 
to the account of any worker and thus cannot be paid in benefits 
the irs and social security headquarters announced a plan last 
month for preventing such discrepancies in the future and for 
attempting to clear up the 10year backlog of errors 
gao surveyed what ssa had done to correct 35 million employer 
reports that make up the 197883 backlog and found that as of june 
10 most of the differences in employer reports to the two 
agencies have not been resolved and likely will not be 
most employers ssa contacted either have not responded are no 
longer in business or no longer have the necessary records gaos 
delfico told the subcommittees 
another 21 million employer reports for 1984 through 1986 are 
being checked as well 
landis neal executive director of the national committee to 
preserve social security and medicare told the subcommittee that 
ssa is giving up too easily on many employers that are responsible 
for the backlog of earlier years 
ssa now claims that is has resolved almost all of the 35 
million cases of missing or discrepant employer wage reports that 
accumulated between 1978 and 1983 neal said what ssa means 
however is that it considers these cases closed 
unfortunately for hundreds of thousands of these cases the 
agency made no effort to correct the records because the amount 
involved was in its view too small neal said 
norman goldstein chief financial officer of ssa urged workers 
to use a new government form to make sure that their own social 
security earnings records are correct the form ssa7004 is 
available in social security offices or by calling 18009372000

the senate spurred by fears about sludge and 
medical waste washing onto east coat beaches voted 970 on tuesday 
passage of a bill which bans the dumping of sludge in the atlantic 
ocean 
the action sends the measure to the house where a similar bill 
is on the floor awaiting final action 
the bill bans the dumping of municipal sludge off the coasts of 
new york and new jersey after 1991 and orders the closing of a 
sludge dump site 106 miles off the new jersey coast that location 
is the only site where sludge currently can be legally dumped 
the site is used by six sewage authorities in new jersey and 
three in new york including the city of new york 
before approving the bill the senate added an amendment by sen 
christopher dodd dconn which bans the disposal of all medical 
waste in oceans or streams it also approved another amendment by 
sen frank lautenberg dnj providing a fiveyear prison 
sentence for anyone caught violating that ban 
both amendments were approved by voice vote without any audible 
dissent 
dodd told his colleagues that because of medical waste washing 
up on his states beaches last week virtually every connecticut 
beach was shut down because of medical waste during one of the 
hottest spells in the states history 
were moving closer to the day when well stop using the ocean 
as a sewer said lautenberg one of the cosponsors sludge 
dumping is a throwaway approach to our waste problem and 
contributes to the overall ocean pollution problem 
sen bill bradley dnj agreed were treating the oceans 
as a cesspool he told the senate 
congress first ordered an end to the ocean dumping of sewage 
sludge in 1972 five years laters congress directed that the 
dumping be ended by 1981 but the nine municipalities in new york 
and new jersey successfully sued in federal court to ignore that 
deadline 
we need a firm deadline in the law to ban the ocean dumping 
of sewage sludge said lautenberg only then will alternatives 
be put in place only then will the dumping stop

democrat michael dukakis slipped to a 
sevenpoint lead over republican george bush in a gallup poll 
released tuesday relinquishing the boost in support he gained from 
the democratic national convention 
dukakis received 49 percent backing in the survey of 1004 
registered voters compared to 42 percent for bush the national 
poll conducted friday through sunday had a threepoint margin of 
error 
a gallup poll two weeks ago just after the convention gave 
dukakis a 17point lead and he maintained that lead in a cbs 
newsnew york times poll done july 31aug 3 before the 
convention dukakis led by six 
poll analysts have characterized the doubledigit dukakis lead 
as a temporary bounce created by news coverage of the democratic 
convention and said they expected bush to recover the ground as 
the race progressed 
it was just a question of when it would happen said larry 
hugick political poll chief for gallup it has happened next 
he said if history is a guide bush should draw even with dukakis 
after the gop convention 
analysts affiliated with both parties reacted cautiously to the 
suggestion dukakis lead may have slipped even before the 
republicans convention next week 
i expect fluctuations back and forth those things dont 
surprise me right now said irwin tubby harrison the dukakis 
campaign pollster im not paying a lot of attention to the ups 
and downs in polls 
its interesting because its the first poll showing movement 
in that direction said lance torrance a leading republican 
pollster but it needs to be confirmed by at least one or two 
other national polls 
torrance hypothesized that the finding could simply reflect 
public interest in bushs impending selection of a running mate 
we can conjecture that some of the vice presidential naming 
game has advanced the normal convention bounce ahead of time he 
said theres been no spectacular event that could have caused 
this 
torrance said the question is whether bush simply rebounded 
early or the republican convention will propel him to an even 
closer race measuring from dukakis big postconvention lead he 
said bush has to get seven points back just to be 10 points 
down to go into labor day 10 points down still gives you a 
relatively formidable task 
harrison similarly said the polls will take on greater 
significance after labor day when voters begin to know the 
candidates better and to focus more on the issues in that vein he 
said dukakis early lead meant little 
these are not men even yet about whom the public knows a 
great deal harrison said theres a different national poll 
out every day its subject to great discussion but ive found in 
the past it doesnt make much sense

a top state department official said tuesday 
the absence of progress toward an internal political settlement in 
angola could block final agreement on the withdrawal of all foreign 
forces from that country 
while expressing optimism based on recent recent talks among 
outside parties assistant secretary of state chester crocker said 
the unresolved civil war in angola could hamper and postone 
efforts to reach a troop withdrawal agreement 
crocker spoke as south africa prepared to begin a threeweek 
pullout of its troops in angola on wednesday under terms of a 
ceasefire reached with angola and cuba 
the accord in which crocker has served as mediator also sets a 
nov 1 starting date for a un plan to grant independence to 
namibia from south african colonial rule 
angolas marxist government has been fighting anticommunist 
guerrillas for the past 13 years that issue is not formally on 
agenda for the series of talks that began in may involving south 
africa cuba angola and the united states the main purpose of the 
talks has been the withdrawal of foreign forces 
the parties next will attempt to reach agreement on a timetable 
for the withdrawal of the estimated 50000 cuban troops from 
angola south africa has linked its withdrawal plan to cubas 
consent to an early pullout of its troops 
it would be tragic if this moment is not seized to bring peace 
to angolans themselves as well as bringing peace to southwestern 
africa in the sense of ending the cross border conflict crocker 
told a news conference 
he said it would mean continued soviet military support for the 
angolan government and continued american backing for the unita 
rebels 
the absence of progress toward an internal settlement in angola 
he added would have a direct bearing on the willingness of 
cuba and south africa to compromise on the troop withdrawal 
question 
crocker said he has made it clear to the parties that the united 
states does not look on its support for unita as something to be 
traded as a bargaining chip in the negotiations on cuban 
withdrawal 
the united states has been providing the unita rebels with about 
15 million in assistance annually crocker said the soviets 
meanwhile have been sending about 1 billion a year in military 
aid to their angolan ally 
the administration has strongly supported the concept of 
national reconciliation talks between unita and the angolan 
government but angolan authorities thus far have maintained that 
the best solution is for the unita forces to surrender their arms 
and take part in a national reconstruction effort

gangs of roman catholics set 
street bonfires and threw rocks bottles and firebombs at security 
patrols early tuesday after two catholics were killed apparently 
by protestant extremists 
the sporadic rioting in catholic areas that began monday night 
also marked the 17th anniversary of britains abandoned policy of 
detaining suspected guerrillas without trial 
police believe the two catholics slain monday were killed in 
reprisal for attacks last week by guerrillas of the predominantly 
catholic irish republican army in northern ireland england and 
west germany that killed six people and wounded 37 
a spokesman at belfasts police headquarters said no violence 
was reported during the day tuesday 
police said security forces came under 83 separate attacks 
during the overnight fighting but the spokesman said fewer than 
500 people probably were involved in the clashes that occurred 
throughout the british province 
officials reported eight policemen were hurt none seriously 
and four of 12 civilians injured were hospitalized 
the ira and its supporters continue to commemorate the 
introduction of the internment law on aug 9 1971 even though it 
was abandoned amid worldwide criticism in 1975 
officials said police and soldiers were attacked with bombs 
rocks bottles and bricks and the patrols responded by firing 
plastic bullets 
some shots were fired at police the officials said but they 
did not report any gunshot casualties and said at one point 
security forces fired live ammunition into the air to disperse 
rioters 
eleven people including two teenage girls were freed on bail 
by courts after being charged with riotous behavior 
an 18yearold man from catholic west belfast was charged with 
throwing a gasoline bomb and assaulting police and remained in jail 
some bonfires flamed out of control and damaged buildings 
including a baptist church before the nights violence subsided 
with demonstrators making their traditional protest of banging 
garbage can lids 
the two men killed monday were seamus morris 17 shot to death 
on a belfast street and peter dolan 25 a beertruck deliveryman 
slain when he tried to block the gunmens getaway 
their deaths raised the known death toll to 2675 from the 
sectarian violence that began in 1969 
stanley whittington president of the methodist church in 
ireland called for the determined pursuit of mindless 
murderers who cross the border to take refuge in the irish 
republic 
he spoke at the funeral of william hassard 60 one of two 
construction men shot to death last thursday by ira terrorists 
because they were working at a police station at the border town of 
belleek 
the ira seeks to unite northern ireland where protestants 
outnumber catholics 32 with the predominantly catholic irish 
republic

house democratic leaders accused the reagan 
administration tuesday of allowing its efforts to deregulate the 
economy to go so far that the safety of american consumers is being 
threatened 
in a report released the week before the republican national 
convention in new orleans the democrats accused the administration 
of lax enforcement of laws inadequate staffing and financing of 
regulatory agencies and a failure to oversee industry aggressively 
the study cited problems with the airline railroad banking and 
maritime industries as well with childrens products food and 
workplace safety the environment drug abuse and fire safety 
we are at greater risk today when we eat travel go the 
beach drink water deposit money in the bank or buy toys for our 
children than we were seven and a half years ago said rep dan 
glickman dkan who oversaw the house task force on safety that 
produced the study 
among the reports conclusions were that reagan has not 
sufficiently financed the coast guard kept up with expansion of 
the airline industry or actively enforced consumer protection laws 
our society has paid an enormous price for this 
administrations ideological attempts to undo a centurys worth of 
consumer protection said rep tony coelho of california the 
house democratic whip 
at their news conference on the report democrats released a 
statement from michael dukakis their partys presidential 
candidate who pledged that if elected he would restore to 
americas families the safety and protection they deserve 
transportation secretary jim burnley criticized the study 
the highly partisan attack today by members of the house task 
force on safety was full of inaccuracies and distortions he said 
in a written response 
he blamed congressional democrats for not providing adequate 
budgets for the coast guard or the federal aviation administration

state department specialists will help 
investigate the bombing of the motorcade carrying secretary of 
state george p shultz the us embassy said tuesday 
a leftist guerrilla group calling itself the simon bolivar 
commando claimed responsibility for the monday explosion which 
investigators said they believed was intended to frighten rather 
than kill three cars were damaged but no one was injured 
cia director william h webster said drug traffickers probably 
were behind the attack 
in terms of the way it was done and the amount of explosives 
that were used it probably came from narcotics dealers who are 
protesting the vigorous legislation and action the bolivian 
government is taking webster told reporters during a visit to 
toronto canada 
he said the cia had no specific warnings of an attack on shultz 
but there was a lot of security down there 
shultz flew to costa rica from la paz on tuesday with a stop in 
santa cruz bolivia to meet with former president hugo banzer 
police said the bomb consisted of several sticks of dynamite 
buried by the roadside and connected to a detonator by more than 40 
yards of cable the explosion hurled rocks and chunks of pavement 
at cars in the motorcade only four of which were armored 
one of those damaged was the armored car carrying shultzs wife 
helena 
callers to local news agencies purporting to speak for the 
simon bolivar commando described the group as antiimperialist 
and indigenous 
they also claimed responsibility in its name for a bombing 
earlier this year at the home of the la paz jail warden and an 
explosion during a visit by king juan carlos of spain in april 1987 
us and bolivian investigators said they had information on the 
group and believe it is responsible for bank robberies and bombings 
other anonymous callers claimed responsibility on behalf of a 
group called the pablo zarate wilca but police discounted the 
claim 
bolivia has had few instances of political violence in recent 
years the few bombings reported generally have caused no injuries 
labor and leftwing political groups had condemned the shultz 
visit as interference in bolivias internal affairs 
farmers and labor have criticized us aid in fighting the drug 
trade and reducing the coca leaf crop because it threatens the 
livelihoods of nearly 350000 farmers who grow coca the raw 
material for cocaine 
a bolivian law that took effect two weeks ago would phase out 
production on 90 percent of coca plantations and impose stiff 
penalties on cocaine producers and traffickers 
the us government has 40 military trainers drug enforcement 
and border patrol agents working with bolivian police in the 
antidrug campaign

the house approved a 39 billion aid package 
for droughtstricken farmers tuesday and sent the measure to 
president reagan who made known he intends to sign it 
we have kept the faith house agriculture committee chairman 
e kika de la garza dtexas said as the house approved the 
bill 38318 to all who will be helped by this legislation our 
promise has been kept 
the house devoted only brief debate to the measure which 
emerged from a housesenate conference committee last week and won 
senate approval on monday congress raced to put the legislation on 
reagans desk before it begins a threeweek break friday 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters hours 
earlier there was no doubt that reagan will sign the measure 
provisions call for government payments to farmers who have lost 
more than 35 percent of their crops because of drought hail 
excessive moisture or related damage such as that caused by 
insects the payments would be equal to 65 percent of their losses 
over the 35 percent threshhold level 
additional payments would be available for the farmers hardest 
hit by the blazing sun and lack of rainfall that have darkened 
fields in the midcontinent 
farmers who have received government incomesupport payments in 
advance would not have to repay them in many cases under the 
legislation 
those receiving payments would be required to purchase federal 
crop insurance for their 1989 crops 
the measure would make feed assistance available for producers 
of many varieties of livestock including cattle sheep goats 
pigs poultry horses used for food or in food production and fish 
used for food 
bills involving major farm subsidies have come in for 
substantial criticism on fiscal grounds from urban lawmakers in 
recent years but the drought measure escaped such complaints for 
the most part 
rep bob walker rpa did complain about a 55 million 
authorization contained in the measure for a temperature control 
system on the sacremento river near shasta dam in california to aid 
salmon spawning 
so the bill is going to take care of yuppies too and make 
sure their salmon mousse supply is not interfered with walker 
said he grumbled that the public is sick and tired of congress 
using every sort of emergency to pork barrel 
de la garza replied that the drought could be even worse in 
california next year than it is now 
the legislation is a bipartisan product that was produced in 
record time about six weeks with lawmakers hurrying to finish 
their work and win the presidents approval before any second 
thoughts about the expense set in or the bill accumulated so many 
specialinterest provisions that it would be impossible to pass 
this bill is the product of a tremendous concerted effort to 
produce relief for droughtstricken farmers said rep edward r 
madigan rill the ranking republican on the house agriculture 
committee 
lawmakers and the administration believe the measure can be paid 
for with funds that the government will save because of the drought 
incomesupport payments known to farmers as deficiency 
payments increase in proportion to the size of the producers crop 
yield the drought has reduced these yields and thus slashed the 
amount that the government will be required to spend 
by some estimates the savings could be as much as 7 billion 
farmers whose yields are reduced by more than 75 percent will 
come in for increased government payments under the legislation 
these payments will be equal to 90 percent of losses over that 
75 percent level

mohammed ali hamadi confessed 
tuesday he helped hijack a twa jetliner to beirut in 1985 but said 
he is not ready to do something like that again and denied he 
killed the us navy diver aboard 
in a statement read in court hamadi said the four hijackers 
were trying to force the release of lebanese shiite moslems 
imprisoned in israel shortly after the ordeal was over israel 
released approximately 700 shiites 
the decision to hijack the plane came after everything else 
failed hamadi said in his surprise confession there was no 
other way to free the prisoners other than the means chosen 
thirtynine americans were held captive for 17 days and us 
navy diver robert stethem was killed his body was thrown onto a 
beirut airport runway 
hamadi is being tried on charges of air piracy and murder in the 
june 1985 twa hijacking the us government also has indicted 
hamadi on charges of air piracy and murder 
hamadi denounced israel for illegal conduct in lebanon 
condemned the united states and said another hijacker had killed 
stethem one of hamadis lawyers said hamadi felt sorry for 
everyone who suffered harm 
in reflecting on the hijacking hamadi told the court i am 
not ready to do something like that again 
as i took part in the action that happened out of the belief 
that there was no other way to get the release of those imprisoned 
now im of the opinion that thats not the case hamadi said 
under west german law hamadi can be convicted of murder even if 
he did not actually fire the shots that killed stethem but one of 
his lawyers said the court would have to prove the hijackers plans 
might have included possible murder 
the court can convict him as a participant in the murder but 
it has to prove that he knew what he was doing said gabrielle 
steckbromme 
three other hijacking suspects remain at large 
hamadi cleanshaven in an openneck shirt read calmly and 
clearly for about 45 minutes while richard and patricia stethem 
parents of the slain diver listened attentively to an interpreter 
the stethems from waldorf md made no gestures visible to 
reporters through the bulletproof glass that separates them from 
hamadi the judges and the rest of the court 
if this act which i committed is against the law then it is a 
result of illegal conduct on the part of israel said hamadi he 
said the hijackers picked a us aircraft because the united 
states is the greatest ally and supporter of israel 
hamadi said that hassan izaldin was in charge of the hijacking 
and had been demanding a negotiator before shooting stethem 
the pistol was in his izaldins hand hamadi said i 
didnt use it our orders were not to harm anyone but i couldnt 
convince him not to shoot 
mrs steckbromme was asked how hamadi felt about the stethems 
presence in court 
he feels sorry for everyone who suffered harm through the 
hijacking mrs steckbromme said 
the lawyer noted that hamadis age at the time of the hijacking 
remains at issue and could determine whether the court will treat 
him as a juvenile young adult or an adult 
but even if the court determines he was a juvenile it could 
decide to sentence him as an adult and hand down a maximum life 
sentence 
the judge asked hamadi to ask his parents to come from lebanon 
to testify about his age then recessed the trial until sept 6 
michael senz another of hamadis lawyers said he hoped the 
confession would lead to more lenient treatment 
the court could now decide not to summon all american 
witnesses because no identification is necessary senz said 
west german television speculated that hamadis confession could 
lead to speedy release of a west german hostage in lebanon but 
government and foreign ministry spokesmen said they had no 
information about any release 
one west german alfred schmidt was released in september 1987 
but the second rudolf cordes remains a hostage 
cordes is believed to be held by hezbollah a radical 
iranianbacked shiite moslem group thought to be holding other 
western hostages in lebanon

south african soldiers 
prepared tuesday to withdraw from angola as part of a peace accord 
but their rebel allies threatened to fight until they are included 
in peace talks 
south africa will begin a threeweek pullout of its troops in 
angola on wednesday under terms of a ceasefire reached with angola 
and cuba the accord also sets a nov 1 starting date for a un 
plan to bring independence to southwest africa also known as 
namibia 
an estimated 3000 south african soldiers are in angola and cuba 
has an estimated 50000 soldiers in the country 
in zimbabwe which has close ties to angola the national news 
agency said cuban troops in southern angola were being pulled back 
to positions north of the 16th parallel roughly 90 miles north of 
the namibian border as part of the agreement 
the accord announced monday was reached in five rounds of 
usmediated peace talks among south africa cuba and angola the 
regions two main guerrilla armies were excluded 
spokesmen for the southwest africa peoples organization which 
has fought for namibian independence since 1966 said it would join 
in a truce in the territory starting sept 1 swapo is believed to 
have a strong chance of taking power in free elections envisioned 
under the un independence plan 
but the national union for the total independence of angola 
unita which has receievd south african and us aid in its 
13year war against angolas cubanbacked government said its 
50000 guerrillas would continue to fight until the countrys 
marxist leaders agree to negotiate a powersharing arrangement 
if the mpla angolas ruling party doesnt accept this the 
armed conflict will continue unita spokesman alcides sakala told 
the associated press in lisbon portugal we will be back at 
square one 
sakala said unita was not concerned by south africas pledge to 
halt aid to the rebels or by a possible cutoff of us aid 
our guerrillas are spread all over the country sakala said 
we have enough supplies and popular support to continue this war 
for many many years 
the accord announced in south africa cuba and angola is 
contingent on a successful outcome of a sixth round of talks the 
week of aug 22 to set a mutually agreeable timetable for 
withdrawal of the cuban troops from angola 
south african commentators expressed cautious optimism tuesday 
that a final settlement was in sight 
as the winter dawn broke over the northern border of 
southwest africa this morning there was a very real hope that 
for the first time in many years peace would come to the troubled 
southwestern region of africa said the staterun south african 
broadcasting corp 
it is not the end of many years of conflict but hopefully it 
is the beginning of the end the television said 
south africas chief representative in namibia 
administratorgeneral louis pienaar told a meeting of white 
farmers the accord was an answer to prayers he suggested that 
moderates and conservatives in namibia form a coalition to oppose 
swapo if independence elections take place 
pienaar called for the drafting of an independence constitution 
that would protect democracy private enterprise and the 
firstworld community a reference to the 70000 whites in the 
territory of 13 million people 
the farright reformed national party urged namibian whites 
tuesday to resist the peace plan to prevent this beautiful and 
good country from lapsing into poverty malpractices and suffering 
as has happened elsewhere in africa where communist tyranny stepped 
in 
swapo which has pledged to allow multiparty democracy if it 
took power in namibia said in a statement it will do its level 
best to help in making the peace process in the southwestern 
african region irreversible and successful provided the pretoria 
regime also shows the political will to do the same 
the group said a military commission would be formed by south 
africa cuba and angola to monitor the ceasefire 
south africa has invited un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar to visit the region the un chiefs spokesman francois 
giuliani said tuesday the invitation was under consideration 
a potential problem in the granting of independence to namibia 
is funding the cost has been estimated at 600 million and a 
senior un official said monday that the cashstrapped body may 
have trouble financing a ceasefire observer team it will send to 
the persian gulf 
another unresolved issue is south africas demand that angola 
close down bases of the african national congress the main 
guerrilla group fighting to end white rule in south africa 
pretoria says there are seven anc bases in angola 
tom sebina an anc spokesman in lusaka zambia said tuesday 
that south africa is merely seeking some diversion from the talks 
the anc camps are not connected with the talks

michael dukakis and george bush exchanged new volleys in their 
political dogfight tuesday with bush placing the democratic 
nominee out on the very very far liberal fringe dukakis 
retorted with a line borrowed from bushs boss there he goes 
again 
just six days before the republican national convention opens in 
new orleans a new gallup poll showed the presidential race 
tightening 
the survey gave dukakis 49 percent to 42 percent for bush in 
telephone interviews with 1004 registered voters aug 57 a 
gallup survey two weeks ago gave dukakis a 17point lead 5437 
coming out of the democratic convention both surveys had a 3 
percentage point margin of error 
things are moving were beginning to get them in focus watch 
and youll see these surveys turn around the vice president said 
bush was in pennsylvania talking about crime and drugs while 
dukakis was in cincinnati discussing housing and attending the 
national governors association meeting 
but both candidates took the occasion to launch new barrages 
claiming the other is fuzzy on the issues 
bush claimed dukakis is trying to hide his record as governor of 
massachusetts 
hes trying to run away from a record in massachusetts on the 
very very far liberal fringe of the political fringe of the 
political spectrum and i have to pin him down bush said in 
pittsburgh he thinks he can preempt the middle 
there he goes again dukakis responded at a news conference 
in ohio echoing ronald reagans famous retort to jimmy carter in 
their 1980 presidential debate 
dukakis called the stealth candidate on monday by bush 
struck back tuesday with a mirrorimage barrage at the gop 
nomineetobe 
i dont think bushs positions are clear on much of 
anything dukakis told reporters as he flew to cincinnati 
on foreign policy where bush has called dukakis inexperienced 
the massachusetts governor said it is the vice president who has 
little to say dukakis said only bushs positions are clear only in 
his support for contra aid which dukakis called this endless 
fiasco in central america 
i dont know do you know where he stands dukakis said to 
reporters i dont think anybody knows where he is on these 
things 
dukakis met with fellow democratic governors at the end of their 
summer meeting taking part in a joking presentation to new jersey 
gov tom kean picked to deliver the keynote speech of the 
republican convention 
dukakis and arkansas gov bill clinton whose lengthy 
democratic keynote speech drew derisive comments gave kean a 
large hourglass 
in new orleans where the gop convention opens monday 
preparations hummed along carpenters banged away on the 
halfmilliondollar podium in the superdome and the gop platform 
committee trudged through the drafting of each policy plank for 
bush and his stillunnamed running mate 
nearly 30000 words of working papers for the platform released 
tuesday echoed the sentiments of the 1984 platform from a notax 
increase pledge to support for antiabortion constitutional 
amendment bush proposals on such matters as child care and 
education were added to the 1984 stances 
in pennsylvania for his last major campaign trip before the 
convention bush focused on building an image as a hardliner on 
law enforcement 
lets not take away the guns of innocent citizens bush told 
the state chapter of the fraternal order of police in erie lets 
get tougher on the criminals 
liberals in congress drew his fire on the fight against drugs 
congress is full of rhetorical heroes on the issue of drugs 
but when it comes to law enforcement a lot of the liberals there go 
awol bush said 
 
republicans are trying to orchestrate their attacks on dukakis 
day by day with the tuesday theme being defense and foreign policy 
we believe the positions taken by gov dukakis threaten the 
peace threaten world stability and threaten the protection of 
american interests globally said former texas sen john tower at 
a news conference held by the leaders of the gop platform 
subcommittees on defense and foreign policy 
tom loeffler a former texas congressman said the gop platform 
would show dukakis basically has a tall pole and a white flag to 
pursue his foreign policy efforts 
in a change of pace dukakis had some nice things to say about 
the reagan administration saying the nations foreign policies are 
moving toward dukakis stands on ussoviet relations the persian 
gulf and conflict in southern africa 
its an administration thats growing frankly theyre 
coming a lot closer to where i am dukakis said heres an 
administration that five years ago was talking evil empire and 
now the president is walking arminarm with gorbachev in red 
square 
the interesting thing is the president and i are closer 
together on ussoviet relations than he is with bush dukakis

president reagan on tuesday nominated lauro 
cavazos a ranch foremans son who rose to be president of texas 
tech university to be secretary of education and the first 
hispanic ever to serve in the cabinet 
although the nomination came during a presidential campaign in 
which both candidates are eagerly courting the hispanic vote 
reagan said he chose cavazos because he seemed to be the 
bestfitted man for the job 
if confirmed by the senate cavazos 61 will succeed william j 
bennett who announced in may that he is stepping down on sept 20 
vice president george bush who is certain to receive the 
republican nomination for president next week has said that if 
elected he would name a hispanic to the cabinet 
asked whether he was stealing some of his bushs thunder 
reagan replied no im just still working at the job here 
alicia sandoval spokeswoman for the national education 
association called the nomination just a ploy to help get bush 
elected and carry texas a classic case of tokenism 
we are glad that the reagan administration has finally 
appointed a hispanic to the cabinet especiall in the education 
field ms sandoval said however we feel this particular 
announcement is politically motivated cavazos is like a substitute 
teacher he wont have the clout to change anything in the little 
time he has 
the nea endorsed democratic nominee walter mondale against 
reagan in the 1984 presidential election the organization has said 
it will announce its 1988 candidate endorsement on sept 8 
in san antonio texas jose de lara president of the league of 
united latin american citizens called the nomination an 
outstanding move 
im sorry that it took so long de lara said but its a 
very smart shrewd move by the administration 
de lara added that cavazos selection was intended to mask 
certain deficiencies in the administrations policies toward 
hispanic americans but i think we have finally demonstrated to the 
administration that education is of crucial importance to hispanics 
in this country 
members of the education community canvassed by the associated 
press said they knew nothing about cavazos 
a typical response came from robert h atwell president of the 
american council on education an association of colleges and 
universities i dont know mr cavazos personally or 
professionally but if he is confirmed we will be happy to work 
with him on behalf of higher education atwell said 
cavazos who appeared with reagan before reporters in the white 
house briefing room said this administration has clearly 
demonstrated that education is one of its highest priorities and 
the initiatives that you have begun in this vital area will be of 
tremendous benefit to this nation and to this nations future 
cavazos who has been president of texas tech in lubbock since 
1980 had announced in may that he planned to resign in july 1989 
he said he planned to go on leave and then return to teach anatomy 
in the medical school where he is a tenured professor 
he is a native of texas where his father was a foreman on the 
santa gertrudis division of the huge king ranch he and his wife 
the former peggy murdock have 10 children 
cavazos received the national hispanic leadership award of the 
league of united latin american citizens in july for his efforts to 
reduce the dropout rate among hispanic youth 
he is a former dean of the tufts university school of medicine 
he began his teaching career as an associate anatomy professor at 
the medical college of virginia in richmond 
at texas tech he headed a university and health sciences center 
with more than 24000 students and 8500 employees 
his story is an american success story bennett said of 
cavazos it is a tribute to his ability to his hard work and to 
opportunity in the united states of america 
reagan also saluted bennett calling him the best thing to 
happen to american education since the mcguffey reader 
introducing cavazos the president said that with his 
administrative skills and his many accomplishments in the field of 
education dr cavazos is an ideal selection for this cabinet 
post 
cavazos is not a medical doctor but received a phd in 
physiology in 1954 from iowa state university he earned his 
bachelors and masters degrees at texas tech 
his commitment to the profession of teaching and to excellence 
in education his belief in getting back to basics and things like 
homework and above all his emphasis on educations special 
importance to americas minorities are messages i hope that he will 
sound far and wide across the nation reagan said 
the president ended his introductory remarks by addressing his 
nominee with a bit of spanish mi casa es su casa or my 
house is your house

defense minister dmitri t yazov says the soviet 
union must fight complacency in the ranks and delays in new weapons 
programs if it is to keep other countries from gaining military 
superiority 
in an article published tuesday yazov recommended ambitious 
action to cleanse the military of outdated attitudes improve the 
reliability of military hardware and make the human factor 
dominant in the soviet military 
yazovs article in the defense ministry newspaper red star was 
an unusually frank account of problems in the soviet military 
before mikhail s gorbachev began his policy of glasnost or 
openness the military was presented only as strong and 
problemfree 
the defense minister has spoken candidly of the militarys 
problems since he was appointed in may 1987 the 64yearold army 
genera was quoted as saying in a speech three months ago that 
soviet soldiers in east germany lack discipline and battle 
readiness 
his latest comments encompassed the entire soviet armed forces 
our military thought is still partially constrained by 
inertia routine and a lack of competition of ideas and opinions 
he wrote 
he said the gap must be reduced between theoretical research on 
new weapons and their actual development and deployment and 
oversimplification and showiness must be removed from military 
training 
bureaucracy and a tendency to blame problems on others plagues 
the soviet armed forces at all levels yazov declared he said 
young commanders soldiers and officers take a passive attitude 
toward deficiences 
senior officers must not alienate themselves from those they 
command he wrote and all ideological and political upbringing 
must be built so that the person is always in the center of 
attention 
yazov said the goal should not be accumulation of military 
might of the armed forces but maintenance of the might at a 
level that precludes military superiority over us and guarantees a 
reliable defense 
last week yazov toured soviet military facilities with frank 
carlucci the visiting us defense secretary

a young wall street lawyer at the center of an 
insider trading ring known as the yuppie five was sentenced to 
four months in prison tuesday nearly two years after he admitted 
his guilt 
michael david pleaded guilty in november 1986 to four criminal 
counts for his part in an insider trading scheme with three other 
wall street professionals and an investor 
the five who have all pleaded guilty to various charges were 
all in their 20s at the time of the indictment and were dubbed the 
yuppie five the case had nothing to do with major insider 
trading cases involving ivan f boesky and dennis b levine said 
officials 
david 30 of new york city the last to plead guilty after his 
pretrial motions were denied by us district judge john keenan in 
late 1986 pleaded guilty to conspiracy securities fraud mail 
fraud and obstruction of a securities and exchange comnmission 
investigation 
you completely disrupt the forces of the free market and help 
to create incredible cynicism among the general populace keenan 
lectured david 
defense lawyer darrell fennell asked for leniency noting that 
david faces disbarment and has been driving a cab to support 
himself 
visibly irritated keenan countered i dont think anyone 
should confuse the practice of law with a right its a 
privilege 
i regret my conduct david told keenan before sentence was 
imposed and asked the judge for an opportunity to help rebuild my 
life as i have tried to do 
if i just say go and sin no more im making a mockery of 
the process said keenan slapping his own wrist 
he sentenced david to four months in prison and four years 
probation keenan did not impose a fine but david faces civil 
penalties of between 50000 and 150000 under a securities and 
exchange commission consent agreement 
assistant us attorney carl h lowenson jr noted that david 
had cooperated extensively with federal investigators for almost 
two years and that if any future trials arise from the probe mr 
david would be an important government witness

the codefendant in the 
cocainesmuggling trial of colombian drug lord carlos lehder rivas 
was declared indigent tuesday and his trial lawyer was 
reappointed to serve as his appeal counsel 
jack carlton reed 57 of san pedro calif was convicted may 
19 on charges he conspired to import cocaine into the united 
states he was sentenced july 20 to 15 years in prison 
us magistrate harvey schlesinger reappointed jacksonville 
attorney stephen weinbaum to represent reed 
reed was questioned by weinbaum schlesinger and assistant us 
attorney ernst mueller about property he earlier owned in canada 
panama and normans cay in the bahamas 
he said he disposed of the property in canada before his arrest 
in february 1987 and that he didnt believe he retains any title to 
the properties in the bahamas and panama 
as far as i know the property on normans cay was 
confiscated by bahamian officials he said 
i am under the understanding that the property has been 
totally ransacked and eaten by termites if it has any value it 
would be very little reed said 
he said if he still owns the property in panama it has no 
value 
i have nothing but the suit on my back said reed adding 
that he had no bank accounts stocks bonds or any other assets 
reed was tried with lehder 38 reputed to be one of the leaders 
of the violent colombian medellin cartel believed to responsible 
for 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into this country 
lehder was sentenced to life in prison without parole plus 135 
years and fined 325000 
jacksonville attorney clyde collins was appointed by schlesinger 
to represent lehder in his appeal until the colombian can hire 
private counsel replacing trial attorneys edward r shohat and 
jose quinon 
although reed denied having any assets the sentencing 
memorandum prepared by former us attorney robert w merkle now a 
republican candidate for the us senate indicates the government 
believes that reed continued to smuggle cocaine until his arrest in 
1987 and was not a poor coconut farmer living off the land as he 
told schlesinger 
according to the memo drug enforcement administration agent 
douglas driver learned in late 1986 that reed was living in a 
remote location on the east coast of panama 
between that time and the time of his arrest on feb 6 1987 
reed was involved in planning large cocaine shipments to the 
western united states the united states has two tape 
recordings of reed talking with a confidential source in connection 
with these efforts 
lehder and reed were convicted of being members of a conspiracy 
which smuggled some 33 tons of cocaine into the united states from 
colombia via normans cay a private island in the bahamas 
the total amount of cocaine documented in trial testimony was 
19700 pounds of that total according to a chart prepared by 
mueller reed transported about 1200 to 1400 pounds from colombia 
to normans cay and personally flew some 3850 pounds of cocaine 
into the united states from the tiny bahamian island about 40 
miles southeast of nassau

sentenced to death by stoning has been aquitted in a retrial and 
freed 
shahida parveen 25 said tuesday i have started a new life 
i prayed to god who helped me and my husband get justice 
a district court judge in this southern city issued the 
acquittal verdict monday 
ms shahida was convicted on nov 7 1987 of adultery by an

married khushi mohammad who was 40 at the time 
she told the islamic court that she and khushi mohammad were 
divorced in april 1986 because she could not have children and he 
wanted to marry another woman the court ruled that divorce 
documents she presented were forged 
last december the associated press wrote a story on the case as 
ms shahida was imprisoned in karachi 
that report and others led mohammad khan junejo who was prime 
minister at the time to examine the case and he asked interior 
secretary sk mahmud to review the convicion and sentencing

ordered 
islamic law requires a confession or statements by four 
witnesses to prove adultery the district court ruled that ms 
shahida had not made a confession and there were no witnesses 
my months in prison are days i cannot forget she said 
tuesday i was a victim of circumstances and my former husband 
wanted revenge because i married mohammad sarwar 
president mohammad zia ulhazs government introduced elements 
of islamic law into pakistans legal code in 1979 
two women previously were sentenced to death by stoning but the 
sentences were reduced to jail terms and flogging

a bright magnesium fire caused a series 
of small explosions and scared residents of this community early 
tuesday only months after an explosion destroyed a nearby plant 
that made a rocket fuel component 
no one was injured in the predawn blaze at a titanium metals 
corp plant but some residents fled the area briefly after they 
were awakened by as many as six small explosions 
police unsure of the nature of the problem began to evacuate 
nearby residents but allowed them to return less than an hour later 
after firefighters brought the blaze under control 
plant manager bob ritchey said the fire posed no danger to 
workers or residents 
everybodys spoiled by pepcon ritchey said if somebody 
sneezes everybody runs for cover 
ritchey referred to a series of explosions at a pacific 
engineering amp production co plant less than three miles away that 
killed two people injured 326 and caused 73 million in propery 
damage may 4 that plant was one of two in the country making 
ammonium perchlorate an oxidyzer in solid rocket fuel 
fire department dispatcher melanie dobosh said tuesdays fire 
apparently started after some magnesium ingots melted and came into 
contact with water in a drain the reaction of the metal and the 
water caused the small explosions she said 
magnesium is used in the manufacture of titanium 
the fire occurred outside an abandoned building at the plant 
ritchey said dobosh estimated damage at 15000 
the fire was reported at 150 am and was under control by 240 
am dispatcher jim martin said officials said 60 firefighters 
including a team specializing in fires involving hazardous 
materials came to the scene and smothered the fire with salt 
it produced a cloud of pretty foulsmelling smoke but it was 
not toxic ms dobosh said it was not as bad as what it 
sounded like it was 
the plant covers several blocks and dates to world war ii 
making it one of the oldest in henderson an industrial community 
of 55000 people 20 miles southeast of las vegas

vice president george bush commenting as 
aides pointed to encouraging new poll figures said tuesday 
watch and youll see these surveys turn around 
bush did not cite any figures to back up his claim that he was 
catching up to michael dukakis however sheila tate his press 
secretary noted a gallup poll that said dukakis lead has dropped 
from 17 points just after the democratic convention to seven 
points 49 percent to 42 percent 
that is turning around bush said of dukakis advantage 
you watch in the next couple of days youll see evidence of the 
turnaround on that things are moving were beginning to get 
them in focus 
bush also renewed his criticism of dukakis accusing his 
democratic presidential rival of trying to run away from a record 
on the very very far liberal fringe 
dukakis when told of bushs remarks said merely there he 
goes again harking back to a line that thencandidate ronald 
reagan used to great effect in a debate with president carter in 
1980 
just six days before the opening of the republican national 
convention in new orleans where he will become the gop 
presidential nominee bush said he still has not decided who will 
be his running mate 
im not close in the sense of like tomorrow making a final 
decision the vice president said bush has said he wants to keep 
his decision a secret until the final day of the convention 
attacking dukakis bush said his opponent was trying to avoid 
being specific on issues 
hes trying to run away from a record in massachusetts on the 
very very far liberal fringe of the political fringe of the 
political spectrum and i have to pin him down bush said 
he thinks he can preempt the middle bush added 
the vice president spoke at an airport news conference in 
pittsburgh after a speech and private fundraiser earlier in erie 
bush later cut the ribbon to open a polishamerican cultural 
center in philadelphia and before a crowd of hundreds in a 
downtown street paid tribute to roman catholic cardinal john krol 
of philadelphia as an inspiration to all of us in public life or 
private life 
he also said there was a special link between poland and the 
united states of america 
in erie bush addressed the pennsylvania lodge of the fraternal 
order of police drawing loud applause with lines such as so 
lets not take away the guns of innocent citizens lets get 
tougher on the criminals 
he said the nation should band together to fight illegal drugs 
with the same fervor as was demonstrated in world war ii 
bush said states that decriminalized possession of drugs 
should recriminalize it 
asked later if he felt that possession of marijuana should be 
made a felony bush said i would be very tempted to make it 
strong to make it a felony he said he would be interested in 
what law enforcement officials felt 
saying his speech was nonpartisan bush did not mention dukakis 
by name but he criticized the american civil liberties of which 
he has said dukakis is a member saying its first concerns are 
the protection of criminals rights and the potential abuse of 
power by police 
and bush who has criticized the prison furlough program in 
massachusetts said he was angered by the arrogant face of a 
criminal back on the street once more because of a permissive plea 
bargain or some furlough 
bush stressed his anticrime theme again in an appearance 
tuesday night at the national night out against crime where he 
switched on a giant lightbulb in downtown philadelphia in a 
symbolic message that people intend to fight for safe neighborhoods 
for those who commit drug related murders and for those 
kingpins who are poisoning our kids the penalty shoudl be death 
the vice president told an audience of about 200 adding that the 
death penalty should also apply to people who kill police officers 
democrats on capitol hill called a news briefing to ridicule 
bushs comments on crimefighting 
george bush thinks that hanging around with all the criminals 
in the administration makes him tough on crime said rep charles 
schumer dny 
since 1981 this administration has failed to support one 
nickel going to state and local law enforcement said rep 
charles rangel dny chairman of the house narcotics committee 
bush said he was urging speakers at next weeks republican 
convention to be positive and to focus on the issues 
but i cant guarantee that somebodys not going to take a 
swipe at michael dukakis bush said i have a lot of friends 
out there and they didnt like the vicious personal attacks 
against bush at the democratic convention andi did not react to 
them but i cant control everybody but im urging them to stay 
positive as im doing 
bush added theres a lot of people out there that want to go 
after em theres a lot of people that feel it was a very unfair 
totally negative tune there 
emphasizing policy differences bush said of dukakis when he 
says hes against the death penalty for everything the country has 
a right to know it i happen to think some crimes are bad enough 
you should

are being held in fulton county jail they have claimed to 
represent aborted fetuses and have identified themselves only as 
baby john doe or baby jane doe the others have been released 
sporadically since their arrests 
the protesters have been held on charges of criminal trespass or 
giving a false name to police

the facility is at capacity

treatment but theyll sleep on the floor 
patterson said daily coverage of the protests on the 700 
club former presidential candidate pat robertsons cable

the navy said tuesday it was 
apparently responsible for medical debris that washed onto beaches 
remote from any metropolitan area but that military officials did 
not know how it happened 
the debris which is washing ashore in north carolina 
appears to be connected with the united states navy said chief 
petty officer joseph mowery a spokesman for the navys atlantic 
fleet in norfolk va 
he said navy officials had ordered a thorough cleanup and a full 
investigation 
navy regulations regarding the disposal of trash especially 
medical wastes are very stringent and we do not yet know how this 
refuse came to be washed up as it has he said 
state and local authorities said it was unlikely the debris 
posed a public health hazard 
we dont foresee any problems at this time as far as closing 
the beaches said john stevens police chief of indian beach 
where syringes and vials such as those used in blood tests were 
found in a trash bag monday night 
gov jim martin said the problem may have been exaggerated 
because of recent concerns at some northeast beaches 
in the past there have always been occasions of things like 
syringes or test tubes washing up onto the beach but people would 
just pick them up and throw them away martin said but with 
the wellpublicized problems of the new jersey beaches people are 
more alert to potential problems with medical debris 
numerous beaches have been closed for varying periods this 
summer along the coasts of new jersey new yorks long island and 
new england because of medical waste and sewage 
a similar problem has cropped up on lake erie with several 
hundred syringes medicaltype tubes and plastic containers washing 
ashore over the weekend near cleveland ohio environmental crews 
wearing plastic gloves combed a private beach tuesday 
i personally view this as probably one of the most disgusting 
and heinous dumpings ive seen of any sort in ohio and we see 
dozens every month usually hazardous waste said ohio 
environmental protection agency director richard l shank as he 
surveyed the beach cleanup 
this is the only time we had anything of this magnitude of 
hospital possibly infectious waste said shank 
he and tim horgan director of environmental health for cuyahoga 
county advised swimmers to avoid white city beach seven miles 
from downtown cleveland 
horgan said syringes occasionally wash ashore possibly insulin 
needles that pass through the sewage system into lake erie but the 
large number found along the white city beach is unreasonable 
north carolinas governor related the problems being faced by 
the coasts to the lack of hazardous waste dumps in the country 
if we cannot provide adequate facilities for properly 
disposing of hazardous wastes people are going to dump them in the 
ocean martin said we made a real mistake last year in not 
deciding on a hazardous waste site for north carolina 
dr ron levine state health director led a team to atlantic 
beach on tuesday to investigate the problem and urged people to 
remain calm a 6inch glass tube containing a brown substance was 
found there saturday and was shipped to a state public health 
laboratory tuesday 
atlantic beach police chief william duke also played down the 
danger of the find there 
its not medical debris as we know it he said its mixed 
in with waste food products we do not think it is related to the 
new jerseynew york problem we think it is related to a passing 
vessel

a senior state department official has flown 
to panama for talks with us diplomats and leading panamanians 
about the political situation in that country the department said 
tuesday 
deputy spokeswoman phyllis oakley said morton abramowitz who 
heads the departments bureau of intelligence and research was 
sent to panama she gave no other details 
other officials who spoke only on condition they not be 
identified said abramowitzs visit does not represent a renewal of 
the us effort to pressure panamanian military leader manuel 
antonio noriega to relinquish power 
that effort collapsed last may when noriega balked at the terms 
proposed by us envoys the state department called off 
negotiations and said no further talks would be held 
it was not clear whether abramowitz planned to meet with 
representatives of the noriegaled government which the united 
states has refused to recognize since it took office nearly six 
months ago the us government recognizes ousted president eric 
arturo delvalle as the legitimate authority in panama 
the officials attached no significance to the fact that 
abramowitz is making the trip during the same week when noriega 
will observe the fifth anniversary of his accession as commander of 
the panamanian defense forces on aug 12 
in panama noriega called abramowitz visit not only part of 
the aggression against panama but also of that against latin 
america 
he spoke with reporters after an hourlong meeting tuesday with 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega 
the visit he said shows a lack of respect that only shows 
how in latin america they american government officials impose 
force and injustice on those who are weaker 
a senior panamanian military official who asked not to be 
identified said abramowitz met with local opposition leaders about 
a plan against the government 
he said it included street disturbances by secondary students in 
panama city and colon on the atlantic ocean end of the panama 
canal and attacks on noriega and other government leaders the 
object is to force the resignation of manuel solis palma named 
interim president after delvalles removal the source said 
a us embassy spokesman said abramowitz would be in panama 
several days 
the spokesman said he would meet with people with many points 
of view but did not confirm the report of talks with opposition 
leaders 
the reagan administration had been trying in may to work out an 
agreement under which noriega would resign as defense chief on that 
anniversary 
ambassador juan sosa a leader of antinoriega forces in 
washington has said he believes noriega may use the anniversary to 
make an important announcement possibly to launch his candidacy 
for presidential elections next may 
noriega indicted on drug smuggling charges by two federal grand 
juries in florida six months ago gave a warm welcome monday to 
visiting nicaraguan president daniel ortega who said that panama 
and nicaragua are under attack by imperialist policies of the 
united states 
the administration has attempted through economic and diplomatic 
pressure to force noriegas departure it was reported two weeks 
ago that president reagan had a approved a covert plan that 
involved encouraging opposition political activities aimed at 
discrediting noriega

the federal reserve board in a move to fight 
inflation said tuesday it was boosting its key bank lending rate 
for the first time in nearly a year analysts said other interest 
rates likely would head higher as a result 
with only three months left before the presidential election 
the board members all appointed by president reagan sent a 
dramatic signal that they were willing to push up interest rates to 
dampen inflationary pressures even at the risk of endangering vice 
president george bushs presidential aspirations 
the increase in the discount rate from 6 percent to 65 
percent was adopted by a 60 vote and took effect immediately it 
was the first change since sept 4 and put the rate at its highest

jeronimo maya cant accept all the offers 
he receives to play his guitar in flamenco concerts because there 
are times when he has to stay home to do his homework 
at 10 the guitar prodigy is already a veteran of three years of 
flamenco shows and his audiences have included spains king juan 
carlos and queen sofia last august he was invited to jordan by 
king hussein and queen noor to play at a royal wedding in aqaba 
its always nice to play for kings and queens the youngster 
said during in a recent interview theyre nice people to meet 
following a recent soldout performance in madrid a music 
critic for spains leading daily el pais called jeronimo 
exceptionally talented 
jeronimo began playing professionally three years ago when his 
guitar was nearly as big as he was he has been studying since he 
was 5 with his father the noted flamenco guitarist felipe maya he 
also studies classical guitar at a madrid conservatory 
maya says his sons talent and success are rooted in hard work 
not in any type of gift from god 
flamenco which encompasses singing guitarplaying dancing and 
handclapping traces its roots to 16th century southern spain 
where it emerged as the artistic response of gypsies to widespread 
repression and was influenced by elements of jewish and moorish 
music 
sometimes his father lets jeronimo stay up to play in a 3 am 
juerga a sort of flamenco jam session at candela madrids 
hangout for flamenco artists and aficionados where he wows the 
latenight crowd with the depth and sensitivity of his playing 
professional flamenco guitarists call him a young maestro who 
plays at a level far advanced for his age 
worldfamous guitarist sabicas says he has never heard a 
youngster play so well 
jeronimo has already appeared twice in the annual flamenco 
summit in madrid on a youth program in 1985 and as a featured 
soloist last year a spot usually reserved for such talents as paco 
de lucia 
felipe maya says jeronimo his other son and two daughters often 
get together with him at home and hold their own juergas 
as gypsies we externalize our feelings and emotions the 
father said we could be sitting around and then we start 
singing and dancing just because we feel like it 
maya says his son has been fortunate not to encounter the 
discrimination many gypsy children suffer in spanish schools 
hes very down to earth and in the school people look up to 
him he said 
jeronimo who wants to travel to china and the united states 
to see the big new york skyscrapers also likes brazilian and 
jazz guitar and says his favorite classical composers include 
mozart beethoven and debussy the latter particularly because many 
of his compositions were based on flamenco patterns

the federal reserve raised the discount rate to 
65 percent from 6 percent this week causing economic forecasts to 
flurry about like a flock of pigeons escaped from the coop 
it was confusing 
some said the fed had to act to slow the economy which was 
overheating and some said the action would be the death of the 
economy which already might have been showing signs of slowing 
some said it would hurt stocks and some said it would make them 
more attractive since it might further strengthen the dollar 
which in turn would make foreigners with lots of money want 
dollardenominated investments 
all this debating will continue for weeks to come and 
impressive as it might sound could in the end if there is one 
add up to nothing at all as one economist observes there seems to 
be a paucity of common sense of late 
what is proven is that 1 economists disagree 2 they often 
disagree impressively but not always with erudition and 3 very 
few people really know where the economy is going and that may 
include the federal reserve 
john tuccillo economist and author of the lament about common 
sense noted a while ago that while economists have occasionally 
been more spectacularly wrong never have they been so consistently 
wrong in so many small ways 
tuccillo chief economist and vice president of the national 
association of realtors has attempted to keep himself free from 
the snares of abstract formulas and computer models that cause some 
economists to leave reality 
it allows him to comment as he did in his latest outlook that 
what is missing from most models is common sense 
in forecasting he says it may be more useful to observe if 
your driving is impeded by public works projects a sure sign of 
prosperity rather than looking at the quadratic reaction 
function of monocentric economic agents 
economists believe in economic models but he observes that 
those models are only as good as the data put into them in his 
view many of the models could be filled with irrelevancies with 
material meant for earlier eras 
there are some real changes going on in the american economy 
that may require some revisions in the way we look at what goes 
on he says the conventional wisdom is being questioned old 
notions might not fit today 
at the same time he continues economists are under growing 
pressure to comment more and more economists are being asked to 
comment on every little statistic he says 
combine this pressure with those shaky models says tuccillo 
and you force economists to wing it often it doesnt work their 
answers are dull incomprehensible wrong or all of the above 
he states adding 
what i am really suuggesting is that most of economics at 
least from the perspective of the general public is common sense 
too much the profession relies on spatial location models to 
determine the best markets rather than asking regional franchise 
managers where they will be placing their franchises and why 
from tuccillos perspective an oddity and irony of the scene is 
the more esteemed the credentials of the economists the more 
learned and academic the background the more scientific the 
models are the worse are the answers 
again he calls for common sense plain thinking and clear 
expression all of which seem from time to time to be forgotten 
by many who attempt to think profoundly 
and that brings him to gracie allen the old comedy partner of 
george burns 
i think in essence she is a useful guide to the times 
says tuccillo 
although gracies strings of logic were as convoluted as dna 
they were always grounded in some observation of the real rather 
than some assumption

in the bestselling autobiography of test 
pilot chuck yeager pioneer flyer pancho barnes is recalled by her 
colleagues as a foulmouthed hellraiser with a face like a 
bucket of worms 
the memoir yeager attributes the colorful description of 
panchos appearance to yeagers friend russ schleeh 
in a new tv movie about the aviators freestyle life pancho 
barnes actress valerie bertinelli portrays the portly adventure 
seeker but the movies producers admit they didnt cast for 
physical resemblance 
this is based on her character and the spirit of it is what 
we hope to capture said executive producer blue andre 
it took four years of combing through letters photos aviation 
books and other research materials before andre was ready to film 
the threehour feature being shot this summer entirely in texas 
with largely instate crew staff and actors 
pancho was born florence leontine lowe the granddaughter of 
thaddeus lowe a scientist who used hydrogen balloons for artillery 
observation in the civil war she tossed aside her genteel rearing 
and her marriage to the rev c rankin barnes to pursue her true 
love flying she became one of americas toprated female pilots 
and the principal stunt pilot for many hollywood movies 
in 1930 she flew her travelaire mystery ship at an average 
speed of 19619 mph to wrest the worlds speed record for women 
from amelia earhart 
but pancho barnes was better known for the rowdy hospitality she 
offered to the greatest pilots of her era at her california desert 
hangout panchos fly inn it later became known as the happy 
bottom riding club and eventually was swallowed by the expansion 
of edwards air force base 
her hangout forms many scenes in the critically acclaimed movie 
the right stuff an epic about test pilots and the nations 
early astronaut program barnes was portrayed in the 1983 movie by 
kim stanley who is somewhat bertinellis senior 
bertinelli acknowledges she doesnt look like the woman shell 
be portraying but found her to be an interesting person to play 
they sent me the script and i said yeah shes a really cool 
woman she said and then i read chuck yeager god the way he 
talks about her when i talked to chuck yeager i said what is it 
about pancho that men loved so much he goes uh uh pilots 
pilots loved her 
with at least 25 vintage aircraft that rent for an average 
5000 and expert stunt pilots the films flying scenes could be 
just as actionpacked as barnes life 
in one stunt charlie hillard a double for bertinelli 
maneuvers a world war i stampe with a wing span of 30 feet through 
the 50footwide opening of a steel hangar exiting through the 
rear he pulls up to avoid a nearby cactus 
the hangar stunt actually was performed by paul mantz in 1935 
the problem is pancho is no longer here and we know she did do 
some work in some howard hughes movies its just that no one 
documented what she did so they just lifted one stunt out that was 
pretty famous said hillard president of the national eagle 
aerobatic team 
however the adjustments in history dont bother hillard who 
located the planes as aviation coordinator for the film i think 
this is going to be a neat little film i think its going to be 
one of the best aviation films ever done 
many of the planes used for filming were stored at hartlee 
field a grassy airstrip in this north texas city once used as a 
world war i training field 
the field operated by the nonprofit fighting air command 
houses a museum of vintage aircraft that are maintained in flying 
condition said allan clark airport manager and museum director 
the chrysler showcase presentation is a blue andre production 
made in association with pancho productions and distributed by 
orion television chrysler and the filmmakers refused to reveal its 
cost but andre called it a very expensive and bigger than 
normal tv movie budget 
its a very costeffective way of putting our message on 
television the cost of production and commercial time is less than 
if we bought the commercials themselves said chrysler spokesman 
steve harris 
chryslers expense is a boon to the texas economy which is 
rebounding from an oil and real estate bust 
roughly a third to a half of the location production budget is 
actually injected into the local budget said dana shelton 
director of the texas filmmusic office in the states department 
of commerce 
fiftythree local actors have roles in the movie several 
playing major characters such as amelia earhart and howard hughes 
most of the technical staff are texans 
the movie to be aired on cbs oct 25 follows barnes life from 
her late teens to her early 40s

a year ago there was talk that alan greenspan 
might become the george twinkle toes selkirk of the us 
economy 
like selkirk the journeyman baseball player who took babe 
ruths place in the new york yankees starting lineup greenspan 
succeeded a legend 
how could this mildmannered economist replace the towering paul 
volcker who as chairman of the federal reserve board grew so large 
in stature that he was often described as the second most powerful 
man in america 
in his first year as fed chairman greenspan has done quite 
well thank you according to the testimomy of members of congress 
the reagan administration and private economists 
hes won friends in congress by being more open and candid than 
volcker who liked to cloak his answers at congressional hearings 
behind a haze of cigar smoke and deliberately vague qualifiers 
he has gained solid support inside the central bank by actively 
seeking out the opinions of the other governors and the 
professional staff who had at times felt left out of 
decisionmaking during volckers eightyear tenure 
to be sure there have been critics at one time or another 
greenspan has been attacked for tightening credit too much not 
tightening enough or for changing back and forth too often 
but all agree that greenspan passed his toughest test with 
flying colors when the stock market suffered its worst day ever a 
508point drop on oct 19 greenspan acted decisively 
mindful of the mistakes the fed had made in the 1929 market 
collapse greenspan quickly reassured a jittery financial system 
that the central bank would supply all the credit necessary to 
compensate for the sudden loss of onehalf trillion dollars in 
stock market wealth 
greenspan began developing contingency plans for just such a 
calamity as soon as he took office on aug 11 1987 ordering 
staffers to draw up a game plan for the fed to follow in the event 
of a market emergency 
the result was a looseleaf notebook with a pink coversheet 
marked restrictedcontrolled the feds label for top secret 
this document which called for establishing a crisiscommand 
post at the central bank became the guidebook greenspan and other 
top policymakers used after black monday 
greenspan ran the feds crisis center from his office keeping 
in touch with regional fed bank presidents across the country to 
make sure bank credit needs were being met federal reserve bank 
examiners were dispatched to the major banks to provide 
onthescene reports 
greenspan managed the stock market crisis with enormous 
finesse said lyle gramley a former fed governor people now 
say nothing much happened following the market collapse but thats 
because the feds skillful handling prevented a total financial 
meltdown 
the move to easier credit had represented an aboutface for the 
fed which in the weeks before the market turmoil was actually 
tightening up on credit on sept 4 after being in office for less 
than a month greenspan oversaw an increase in the feds discount 
rate to 6 percent the first time this fee the fed charges to make 
bank loans had been raised in three years 
the sudden increase was seen as a macho signal that greenspan 
intended to be just as tough an inflationfighter as volcker but 
it also opened him to criticism that he had needlessly unnerved 
already jittery financial markets and had actually contributed to 
the markets later crash 
greenspan dismisses charges that the feds tightening played any 
role in the market plunge saying that stocks had become overpriced 
and the record drop was an accident waiting to happen 
just tuesday the fed announced another increase in the discount 
rate to 65 percent saying the action reflects the intent of 
the federal reserve to reduce inflationary pressures and was 
taken in light of the growing spread of market interest rates over 
the discount rate 
this year the fed has been criticized for trying to finetune 
the economy attempting to keep it on course with repeated small 
changes in monetary policy 
greenspan announced that the fed slightly eased credit 
conditions in early january because of worries about possible 
sluggish growth then barely two months later the fed began 
pushing interest rates back up again because of signs of unexpected 
economic strength 
while the central bank has seldom been successful pursuing a 
fineturning strategy greenspan supporters say at this advanced 
stage of the economic recovery there is little else the fed can do 
we are in the stage of a business cycle where the fed has to 
try to slow the economy down without killing it said david wyss 
senior financial economist at data resources inc of lexington 
mass 
the greenspan fed also has come under fire for sending confusing 
signals to the markets about what economic barometers are guiding 
monetary policy greenspan has talked about monthly unemployment 
data and business delivery times fed vice chairman manuel johnson 
follows the credit markets closely and fed governor wayne angell 
has been a vocal proponent of watching commodity prices for clues 
on inflation 
to make matters worse in the eyes of critics fed officials 
talked openly about their different preferences stirring concern 
that the fed lacking volckers strong presence was adrift 
fed officials have defended the new candor pointing out that 
while different barometers are being watched the votes on monetary 
policy are almost always close to unanimous greenspan was 
sufficiently concerned by the criticism though that he 
recommended in private that all fed officials cool their public 
comments which they have done 
greenspan 62 also has moved to assert his independence from 
the administration taking extra care lest the markets perceive 
that the fed was becoming lax in its inflationfighting zeal 
because of political pressures during an election year 
while fed independence is always considered crucial greenspan 
faced particular scrutiny because of his longtime republican ties 
he had served as chairman of president fords council of economic 
advisers and headed up a blueribbon commission for president 
reagan which came up with a rescue for the nearly bankrupt social 
security system in 1983 
at one point after a series of perceived attempts by the 
administration to influence fed decisions greenspan complained 
publicly and warned that the concerns over political pressure could 
get so extraordinary that the fed would end up taking actions 
in the opposite direction just to prove its independence 
since that february comment the administration at the orders of 
treasury secretary james a baker iii has adopted a handsoff 
approach 
so far greenspans balancing act of keeping the aging recovery 
alive while remaining vigilant against inflation is working the 
economy is now in its 69th month of expansion a peacetime record 
while being careful to say that the business cycle has not been 
repealed greenspan clearly hopes that he and his fed colleagues 
can keep the balancing act going for a while longer but it would 
be a real feat if he does not have to deal with a recession at some 
point before his fouryear term ends in 1991 
at his swearingin ceremony a year ago he joked about all the 
economic forces that would conspire to make his job easy for him 
he took time to thank in advance inflation which always stays 
put the stock market which is always a bull the dollar which is 
always stable interest rates which always stay low and 
employment which stays high

joy elektra teddy pendergrass 
 
joy is a steamy set of soul songs that never overheats due 
to the restraint of the tempos arrangements and teddy pendergrass 
delivery 
even when pendergrass sings of explosions of ecstacy flowing 
from you and me on 2 am his cooing manner is such that 
the words would probably slip right past tipper gore 
the song titles can we be lovers im ready love is 
the power show that pendergrass is obsessed with the same thing 
as prince but pendergrass is less overt 
the accompaniment steers clear of lead guitars or horns that 
would clash with pendergrass smooth style drums bass and 
lowprofile keyboards dominate the closest thing to a frill is 
three female backup singers pendergrass plays off them when he 
raps briefly enough to avoid being corny and when he improvises 
nicely on the chorus of through the falling rain 
the eight love songs on joy are all played at midtempo 
pendergrass message is clear this is music for romancing not 
dancing

brian wilson sire brian wilson 
 
the storys so irresistible you almost want to will it to be 
true 
brian wilson rock n roll hall of fame member and erstwhile 
beach boy releases his first solo lp after 20 years of being 
nearly incapacitated by mental illness can the lost genius ever be 
found 
not really 
in one respect this new album is a triumph few people honestly 
expected wilson to ever again release listenable music of any form 
so anything more is gravy 
but lets be honest despite some pleasant moments brian 
wilson cant compare with any of the early 60s beach boys 
classics nor a lot of other good music happening today 
its a nondescript album that floats by without any songs 
grabbing hold and shaking out any reaction frankly both the 
smithereens and xtc alteregos dukes of stratosphear have written 
better brian wilson tributes in the past year than wilson himself 
back when he was young wilsons classic in my room spoke 
universally to teenagers who occasionally need to escape into 
themselves and not feel childish about it 
but a generation has passed and wilson still hasnt left his 
room in love and mercy he talks of lyin in my room and 
seeing a lot of people out there hurtin and it really scares 
me the prescription love and mercy isnt much different from 
what the beatles suggested 21 years ago 
baby let your hair grow long suggests a troubled girl may 
cure her problems with an adjustment in grooming a naivete that 
seemed charming 25 years ago is less so now 
and musically what once seemed effortless is now labored too 
many rhythms are ponderous and the phil spector touches in the 
production mostly sound dated 
there are some high points walkin the line with the vocal 
help of terence trent darby is breezy and warm and meet me in 
my dreams tonight is a pretty fantasy song wilsons old beach 
boy mates dont appear but the a capella one for the boys is a 
worthy tribute 
and the eightminute concept song rio grande is not the 
disaster that its length and lyrics suggest 
no brian wilson doesnt embarrass himself with this effort but 
dont throw away your old beach boy albums

entertainment writers are always informed 
that peewee herman will be interviewed as peewee herman the film 
and television star not as paul reubens his reallife identity 
how do you deal with that would you interview lucille ball as 
lucy ricardo sean connery as james bond how to question peewee 
herman in squeaks and baby talk 
such questions go through a reporters mind as he awaits the 
arrival of the star on a huge empty paramount studio stage he 
appears at the far end a tiny figure in the now familiar tootight 
suit hair plastered down lips pursed but as he sits down to 
talk he is sigh neither peewee herman nor paul reubens 
rather hes someone in the middle 
he has come to talk about big top peewee the paramount 
pictures release he hoped would repeat the success of the 1985 
peewees big adventure returns so far have been respectable 
but not overwhelming but he also talked about other matters 
presumably as paul reubens 
why a circus movie 
i grew up in sarasota fla which is the old winter 
headquarters of the ringling show he explains i knew a lot of 
circus people and i knew of a lot of circus people my school had 
a circus that included children of the performers 
i always wanted to be an aerialist but they told me i was too 
scrawny to be a catcher i thought i might be a clown or acrobat 
and i learned to walk the tightrope which he does in the film 
but i got in show business as an actor instead i always thought if 
i didnt get successful ill give up and join the circus 
born paul rubenfeld in peekskill ny in 1952 he grew up in 
sarasota where his parents ran a lamp store young paul was a 
jokester always putting on shows for the neighbor kids later 
graduating to summer stock after high school he spent a year at 
boston university and was then turned down by the juilliard school 
and carnegiemellon university so he enrolled at the 
disneyendowed california institute of the arts in valencia 
when i first came out to hollywood i thought people would 
discover you then you became a movie star and they figured out 
a way to keep you a movie star he reflected i had an 
unrealistic view of what it was all going to be like when i 
realized that i wasnt going to be one of those people who were 
discovered i decided id better discover myself 
when and where was peewee born 
difficult question he says cautiously i was part of a 
comedy group here in los angeles and we had our own theater 
let the record show that the theater was the groundlings where 
reubens appeared at night while preparing pizzas and selling fuller 
brushes by day in 1979 he began developing the character of a 
wouldbe comedian who is hopelessly innocent and untalented 
peewee came from a oneinch harmonica herman from an obnoxious 
childhood acquaintance 
peewee herman became a onehour show he performed for a year at 
the roxy theater on the sunset strip then taped for hbo late 
night with david letterman brought him more attention followed 
by steve martin tv specials and appearances on the tonight show 
starring johnny carson 
peewees big adventure proved that the comedian had wide 
appeal he was one of the few who werent surprised by the films 
success 
i was confident i felt like the script was good and the 
director tim burton who made beatlejuice and the team were 
good i had a lot of pride in it i was more relieved that it was a 
success that my feelings were right 
peewees playhouse began appearing on cbs saturday mornings 
in the spring of 1987 and has been widely praised for its 
imagination and entertainment value why did he enter childrens 
programming 
i guess my real motivation was cbs begging me to do it i kept 
saying no i dont want to do it and they said please please 
do it so i decided to give them a break and do it giggling 
really it just seemed like a fun thing to do at first we 
discussed an animated cartoon which i didnt want to do then i 
told them about a sort of salute to childrens shows that was more 
oriented for adults it started out as a midnight show that some 
called a satire i called it a salute so i suggested making it a 
liveaction show like the ones i grew up on they said ok 
reubens lapses into herman when he discusses one of his costars 
in big top peewee a talking pig 
we had a nationwide talent search for the pig and when you 
do that you hopefully come out with talent he said i will 
have to wait for the critics to tell me whether he stole scenes 
from me i am a giving actor and i think he was too so we meet 
evenly somewhere 
since i wrote the film i have the better dialogue funnier 
lines i also get to breathe down the directors neck in the 
editing room if the pig was getting too many laughs then snip 
snip snip nobody is funnier in a peewee herman movie than 
peewee herman 
he giggles

time is erasing hundreds of giant artworks from 
chicago buildings used as canvas during the 1960s and 70s when 
muralists transformed gray city landscapes with color and dreams 
to bill walker a publicart pioneer whose murals celebrate 
heroes of the civil rights movement the decay goes deeper than the 
layers of paint on brick and concrete 
weve lost something very important weve lost compassion 
caring and concern for all much of that was expressed in the 
murals he said 
walkers powerful wall of peace and salvation wall of 
understanding is one of about 200 urban murals splashed across 
chicago a small movement is under way to save or restore some of 
the works but there is little money to support it 
the mural was painted by the elevated tracks in the shadow of 
cabrinigreen a public housing project plagued by gang warfare 
crime and violence he chose the site he said because the mural 
concerns choices 
commuters speed past its chipped and peeling images of nobelist 
martin luther king jr and slain black muslim malcolm x a youthful 
jesse jackson is there as well these heroes are contrasted with 
symbols of death and violence the alternatives to a life of peace 
the fading images 4 stories tall still have a haunting 
presence though much of their power is gone 
i think the city is losing part of the civil rights struggle 
or human rights struggle said victor sorell an art history 
professor at chicago state university those murals are an index 
or a signpost of those times 
their deterioration represents a loss of neighborhood city 
and community history sorell said 
murals are an outdoor museum he said especially in poor 
communities with fewer ways to preserve history and hope 
chicago is considered the birthplace of the movement that 
produced these blackboards for the people and spread to other 
us cities especially on the east coast and in the southwest 
walkers first outdoor mural the wall of respect created 
in 1967 with about a dozen other black artists from the south side 
is widely acknowledged as the first example of contemporary 
american community murals 
it was destroyed two years later when fire gutted the south 
side building that served as the canvas for an 8foot muhammad ali 
and other portraits of prominent blacks in entertainment politics 
the arts and religion 
many other works are lost or face destruction by time and the 
elements said sorell who has published a guide to chicagos 
murals 
they most definitely should be refurbished he said the 
question is where will the money come from 
the chicago public art group uses city state federal and 
private funds to sponsor outdoor art work but channels no money 
toward preservation said muralist and group member john weber a 
professor of art at suburban elmhurst college 
the city still funds new public art preferring to spend 
resources on more permanent works than on restoring deteriorating 
murals said jim futris director of public art for the department 
of cultural affairs 
aurelio diaz who spearheaded the public art movement among 
chicagos hispanics says the city should sponsor restoration of 
the murals that chronicle the issues and struggles of its people 
its not just art its a way of recording the history of the 
people said antonio dos santos an artist who works with diaz 
luis martinez who owns an auto repair shop near a 
threeblocklong diaz work said neighborhood residents and 
businesses feel proud about these kind of murals its good 
for everybody and helps the community improve 
but walker is resigned to the loss of his works the wall of 
peace served a purpose in its time he said but perhaps that 
time is past an artist by profession he has touched up the lower 
sections of his masterpiece but never succeeded in restoring its 
original 1970 appearance 
im sad i couldnt preserve it any longer but i didnt have 
the financing he said 
during the late 70s diaz and citypaid teenagers painted 
murals in the pilsen neighborhood where spanish is heard more than 
english and mexican bakery goods are offered at stands on every 
block 
the legend of bonampak depicting an ancient mayan fable 
was executed with help from members of different neighborhood 
street gangs recalled diaz 31 who emigrated from mexico in 1971 
the mural gave the kids a way to channel their creative 
energy he said 
it covered years of graffiti and even now after 11 years there 
are only a few gang scrawls on the worn surface diaz said 
for years weber recalled the gangs wouldnt touch murals in 
other peoples neighborhoods one would not see graffiti on a 
mural 
martinez who stored supplies for diaz and his teenage crew 
while they painted the galeria del barrio still chops down 
weeds in front of the mural 
every week you can see some tourist buses stop to look at 
it he said

cohesion within the 13nation organization of petroleum exporting 
countries of which iran and iraq are members that could lead to a

a government mission charged with 
extracting new loans from foreign commercial banks begins its 
difficult task this week amid venezuelas growing frustration at 
its inability to escape from its vicious circle of foreign debt 
the team headed by finance minister hector hurtado navarro 
will try to convince banks in new york washington and san 
francisco to lend up to 3 billion to cover this years estimated 
25 billion balance of payments deficit 
the discussions could be rocky as venezuela blames its 
inability to grow out of its economic problems on the weight of the 
foreign debt while foreign banks see its problem as one of lax 
domestic policy 
we understand that the debt is the gordian knot of our current 
economic situation and we have decided to cut it president 
jaime lusinchi stated emphatically in a televised address last week 
the balance of payments deficit is the product of continued low 
oil prices which could limit income from venezuelas main export 
to just 82 billion this year 
scheduled payments on its 34 billion foreign debt estimated at 
5 billion this year will absorb 60 percent of that severely 
limiting the nations prospects for growth in an election year 
but the government is equally frustrated by the fact that 
venezuela paid over 30 billion in capital and interest between 
1983 when its debt problems began and last year but its total 
debt has remained virtually unchanged 
venezuelan officials claim commercial bank creditors have 
reneged on a promise to provide venezuela with new funds and help 
it regain access to international financial markets 
the nations 2034 billion foreign debt refinancing agreement 
first signed in 1986 was revised early in 1987 to allow for more 
favorable terms including a clause in which banks promised to 
look favorably upon requests for new loans 
but besides an estimated 35 billion in shortterm lines of 
credit and a 100 million issue of republic of venezuela bonds no 
new balance of payments loans have been made 
servicing the foreign debt was made under the promise that 
financial flows would be reneweddebt service has been an 
obligation that has limited our possibilities to eradicate our 
crisis lusinchi said 
the frustration has led to persistent rumors in recent weeks 
that venezuela might declare a unilateral debt payment moratorium 
as some government party members want 
but lusinchi and other top administration officials said any 
suspension of payments would occur only if this weeks mission 
fails and even then only in concert with commercial banks 
and hurtado said before leaving for new york last weekend that 
any new talks to seek more favorable terms on the refinanced debt 
would begin only after a new administration takes office early next 
year 
a temporary suspension of payments this year is a faroff 
possibility but it is a possibility said domingo maza zavala a 
private economist who advises the government on economic policy 
but government efforts to control the domestic impact of the 
debt are showing signs of strain 
due to lack of sufficient income government spending programs 
designed to promote growth have been based on internal debt which 
has risen to 7 percent of gross domestic product according to the 
international monetary fund 
the spending resulted in domestic growth of 5 percent in 1986 
for the first time in eight years but growth slowed to 3 percent 
last year and according to private estimates could be flat again 
this year 
inflation which the government hoped to limit to 15 percent 
this year already had topped 12 percent through july and private 
economists estimate it could reach 25 percent by december 
and the free market exchange rate for the us dollar an 
important indicator of local business psychology zoomed last week 
to more than 38 bolivars a record level and nearly three times the 
official exchange rate 
nevertheless analysts feel the government has room to adopt 
policies which would help solve the domestic imbalances including 
raising domestic interest rates and increasing fiscal revenues from 
public services 
the financial mission is armed with an outline of possible steps 
the government could take in return for new cash 
foreign bankers say they probably would require such measures 
which would be similar to austerity guidelines often recommended by 
the imf as a condition of any new loans 
foreign bankers also say venezuela should look for new money in 
other places first which usually means the imf 
but venezuela is unlikely to want to change its policy of 
avoiding an imf connection in order to maintain the freedom to set 
its own economic priorities 
politically for a government ending its term and in an 
electoral year going to the imf would be very very difficult 
said maza zavala

cbs inc flush with cash from sale of major 
nonbroadcasting assets says it plans to look for more prospects 
in the wake of its agreement to purchase an independent television 
station in miami for 59 million 
cbs said monday that its agreement to acquire wcixtv from tvx 
broadcast group inc of norfolk va also calls for it to assume 
certain program obligations which a cbs spokesman said were valued 
at about 13 million 
laurence a tisch cbs president in announcing the deal said 
we are continuing to evaluate other potential properties with an 
eye toward further acquisitions 
financial analysts said the deal seemed good for cbs and tisch 
who had been faulted for failing to buy more stations with the 3 
billion amassed by selling assets such as its records and magazine 
businesses 
on wall street cbs stock slipped 12 cents a share to 16287 
on the new york stock exchange 
the purchase of the station which is subject to regulatory 
approval would allow cbs to maintain its presence in the 
fastgrowing miami television market at only a fraction of the 
price a network affiliate likely would have commanded miami is the 
nations 16th largest tv market 
cbs was outbid last year in an effort to buy its miami 
affiliate wtvj by general electric cos national broadcasting 
co which offered 270 million wtvj still carries cbs programs 
under an affiliation agreement that ends in january when it is 
expected to become an nbc affiliate 
peter appert a media analyst for the investment firm cj 
lawrence morgan grenfell inc said the wcix purchase looks like 
an excellent deal 
they bought a new network affiliate station for an incredibly 
low price he said 
appert said independent stations command lower prices because 
they have higher programming costs attract smaller audiences and 
generate lower advertising revenue affiliates get some programming 
from the network and often can charge higher ad rates for programs 
such as local news that may appear just before network programs he 
said 
barry kaplan media analyst for goldman sachs amp co said 
buying an independent station might send a dangerous signal to 
cbs affiliates who have a competing independent station in their 
market 
there might be a risk in any market where there is a vhf 
independent he said a vhf station is one operating on channels 
2 through 13 
but philip jones vice president and general manager of kctv in 
kansas city mo and a former head of the cbs affiliates board 
said there were only a handful of markets where that situation 
existed it sounds to me like its a smart buy he said 
affiliates had been urging tisch to buy a few stations to 
demonstrate his commitment to the network tisch told them he 
wanted to do so but that the asking prices were too high 
cbs owns television stations in new york los angeles chicago 
and philadelphia that reach 194 percent of the countrys viewers 
with wcix its stations would reach 208 percent of the country 
nbcs parent has seven stations reaching 224 percent of the 
country capital citiesabc inc has eight stations reaching 244 
percent 
federal communications commission regulations limit network 
companies to owning a maximum of 12 stations reaching 25 percent of 
the country 
cbs also announced monday that wpectv in west palm beach fla 
would become a cbs affiliate in january the station is now an abc 
affiliate and the signing is seen as helping cbs reach an audience 
north of miami where the wcix signal is weak

an environmental organization says smog got 
worse this year in cities and counties from maine to louisiana and 
that while the hot muggy summer is partly to blame 
ozoneproducing pollutants are the root cause 
obviously the weather is part of the problem dan weiss 
washington representative of the sierra club said monday in an 
interview but its not the source blaming the weather for high 
levels of pollution is like blaming the ground for a plane crash 
 
the smoggy summer of 88 is an unpleasant preview of a dirty 
unhealthy future unless congress strengthens the clean air act by 
restricting emissions from motor vehicles and industrial 
polluters he said 
a sierra club survey found that through aug 3 41 of 47 cities 
and counties had peak ozone readings at least 25 percent greater 
than the safe federal health standard compared with 36 in this 
category for all of 1987 
the federal health standard for ozone is 012 parts per million 
ozone which causes respiratory problems is formed when nitrogen 
oxides and hydrocarbons combine in the presence of sunlight 
the sierra club said the worst reading was 024 ppm in 
providence ri new york city had a 021 ppm reading in 1988 but 
this was well below its worst 1987 reading of 029 ppm according 
to the survey 
every city in the survey exceeded 012 ppm at least once 
nineteen areas exceeded the standard by 50 percent at least once 
so far in 1988 up from 14 in 1987 while nine had at least one 
reading 75 percent higher than the standard up from four last 
year according to the survey 
thirty cities and counties exceeded the airquality standard 
more times through aug 3 than they had during all of 1987 the 
survey said 
the only western state surveyed texas actually had better 
readings than it had in 1987 the four texas cities surveyed 
beaumont dallas el paso and houston showed improvements over 
the previous airquality readings 
weiss said the sierra club obtained the data through telephone 
interviews with state and local air pollution control agencies 
which he said supply the same monitoring data to the environmental 
protection agency

ten years after love canal was 
declared a national disaster area because buried chemicals were 
oozing to the surface the largely abandoned neighborhood remains 
at the center of environmental debate 
the former chemical dump that forced hundreds of families from 
their homes has been fenced off and surrounded with clay and 
plastic liners to prevent chemicals from leaking into groundwater 
corroding drums of chemicals have been separated and complex 
runoff monitoring and collection systems have been built 
but even though the contamination has been largely contained and 
state officials have begun to talk about restoring the neighborhood 
to residential use critics think love canal and hundreds of 
similar sites throughout the nation will remain potential disasters 
until a safe disposal method is found 
weve spent the first 10 years catching up on the sins of the 
past acknowledged epa spokesman james marshall who noted that 
the discovery of love canals threat was largely responsible for 
federal toxic waste cleanup legislation 
the future will have to be spent changing industrial processes 
and peoples attitudes about waste generation marshall said 
in many ways the next 10 years will be more important than the 
first 
love canal an abandoned waterway project was used by the 
hooker chemical co to dispose of thousands of pounds of chemical 
wastes in the 1940s hooker made herbicides and pesticides 
in the 1950s the canal and its contents were covered and homes 
and an elementary school were built it wasnt until the early 
1970s that people began to notice foul smells in their basements 
and oily puddles in their yards 
they also began to notice higherthanusual incidences of 
miscarriages birth defects cancer leukemia neurological 
disease allergies epilepsy and suicides 
but government was slow to react it took mass protests and town 
meetings turned into near riots to prod the state into action 
on aug 7 1978 president carter declared a state of emergency 
at love canal 
eventually 728 homes in a 50block area were evacuated and the 
elementary school and 228 of the houses were torn down 
the state and federal governments filed multimilliondollar 
lawsuits against hooker the cases are still being pursued against 
the companys parent occidental chemical corp 
today inside the fenced dump crews in protective suits carry 
out small projects to shore up containment walls or check 
monitoring wells 
outside the fence houses are boarded up and decaying 
a few are still inhabited 
we always hoped theyd decide that it was safe to live here 
and that things would return to normal one day said william 
stevenson a retiree who stayed in his house two blocks from the 
dump site 
some 175 other families are awaiting the results of a state 
habitability study before returning state health commissioner 
david axelrod is to decide the habitability question this fall 
if axelrod determines that the area is habitable the state will 
have to assume liability for those who return said former resident 
lois gibbs now a washingtonbased environmental activist 
will the deeds carry health warning labels she said 
gibbs said environmental groups would sue to block resettlement 
arguing that no one knows what levels of exposure to the chemicals 
are safe 
if love canal is declared unsafe it would set a precedent for 
people living around toxic waste dumps nationwide the cost of 
relocating those people and cleaning those dumps would be 
astronomical she said 
the state however has vowed not to leave love canal a vacant 
field as a symbol of environmental disaster 
we have a vision of love canal as a usable landscape again 
state environmental conservation commissioner thomas jorling said 
recently 
epa spokesman marshall said habitability decisions are being 
made across the country though none are of the same magnitude as 
love canal 
no situation is risk free he said you cant expect to be 
part of a highly developed industrial society without weighing 
risks and ultimately living with them

a defense lawyer for nelson bunker hunt says 
theres no evidence that the texas oil tycoon and his two brothers 
were part of a plot to corner the world silver market nearly 10 
years ago 
hunt and his two younger brothers are being sued for 150 
million by a south american silver concern that claims the 
dallasbased hunts manipulated the world silver market between 1979 
and 1980 
in his closing argument to the jury monday at federal court in 
manhattan paul j curran noted that the hunts lost more than 1 
billion when the silver market collapsed in 1980 
where is the evidence they made a profit curran asked the 
sixmember civil jury if they were part of a conspiracy it was 
one spectacular failure 
the hunts placid oil co and their three individual trusts 
which control penrod drilling co are in bankruptcy proceedings 
curran said the hunts were victims just like other silver 
investors 
they believed too much in silver they played and they paid 
said curran 
minpeco sa a mineral marketing company owned by the peruvian 
government claims in a federal civil action that the brothers 
nelson bunker hunt 62 william herbert hunt 59 who also has 
extensive real estate holdings and lamar hunt 56 owner of the 
national football league kansas city chiefs conspired 
unsuccessfully with several middle east businessmen to corner the 
world silver market 
the trial before us district judge morris e lasker began in 
february 
lawyers for minpeco claim the hunts and their middle eastern 
codefendants were responsible for the sharp rise in silver prices 
from about 9 an ounce to more than 50 an ounce between september 
1979 and january 1980 
minpeco had a large short position in the silver futures market 
which meant it would make money on dropping silver prices and lose 
money on rising prices 
minpeco claimed it lost more than 100 million due to 
skyrocketing silver prices that fell back to about 10 an ounce in 
march 1980 
six financial institutions accused of participating in the

a japanese company on monday became the first 
foreign firm to buy land from the chinese government in public 
tender bidding 
the official xinhua news agency said sun enterprises ltd of 
japan beat out five other firms to win rights to use a 
12900squaremeter 139320squarefoot plot in shanghais 
hongqiao economic development zone for 50 years 
the report said the company will pay 10416 million yuan 28 
million for the land it plans to construct apartment and office 
buildings restaurants stores and recreational facilities there 
the selling of landuse rights is the latest and one of the 
more controversial measures taken by the beijing government to 
raise badly needed capital for economic development 
last month the city of shenzhen a special economic zone across 
the border from hong kong held chinas first land auction with 
two chinese companies winning the bidding for property development 
sites 
land in socialist china technically all belongs to the state 
but economists are now arguing that a market in landuse rights 
will bring in needed capital bring about a more efficient use of 
land and speed up urban development 
in the countryside family farms that were rehabilitated with 
the start of agricultural reforms in 1979 usually have 10 to 
15year contracts for farming a plot of land but normally do not 
pay rent to the state 
in the cities most chinese factories and buildings occupy land 
without charge for unlimited periods 
the national peoples congress chinas legislature paved the 
way for landuse sales last april when it amended the constitution 
to eliminate a prohibition against leasing land and added the 
sentence landuse rights according to legal regulation can be 
transferred 
some rural areas now allow residents not using their land to 
lease it to more ambitious farmers needing larger tracts the 
government at the end of last year also named seven urban areas 
that may experiment with landuse sales shenzhen shanghai 
canton tianjin hainan fuzhou and xiamen 
communist party general secretary zhao ziyang however stressed 
recently that public ownership will remain dominant in china his 
statement appeared to be meant to assuage other party leaders 
worried that china was losing its socialist character with the 
emergence of thriving private enterprises and the selling of state 
land

press the nations 10thlargest newspaper in terms of circulation 
could not stem the losses that had brought it to the brink of 
failure 
keen competition aimed at market domination and future 
profitability competition waged energetically but both 
responsibly and properly has moved both newspapers into 
intractable loss positions from which only one the news now 
appears to have any reasonable prospect of emerging said meese 
who is scheduled to leave office in midaugust 
directors of knightridder inc owner of the free press had 
threatened to close the newspaper unless meese approved the joint 
operating agreement gannett co incs news the nations 
eighthlargest newspaper had a daily circulation lead of about 
40000 in march 
this decision reaffirms the will of the congress that two 
independent editorial voices should be preserved wherever possible 
in the cities of america said alvah h chapman jr 
knightridder chairman 
gannett chairman allen neuharth and gannett president john j 
curley said they too were gratified 
we said all along that the joa was the only way to preserve 
two independent news and editorial voices they said in a 
statement from gannett headquarters in arlington va the 
attorney generals decision is in the best interest of the 
community the readers the advertisers and the employees 
free press employees toasted the decision with champagne in 
plastic cups 
it was like a rush waiting for the decision is like living on 
death row said senior managing editor neal shine who had been 
assigned to write the newspapers obituary if the partial merger 
had been denied 
the newspaper guild local 22 which was the last union to 
formally drop its opposition to the joa after it gained improved 
economic terms was still critical of meeses decision 
this is a travesty of the newspaper preservation act said 
lou mleczko a reporter at the news and president of the union 
which has 1100 members at the two newspapers 
i feel it would have been an extraordinary tragedy if this 
paper died said david lawrence jr publisher of the 
157yearold free press 
meese rejected recommendations by the departments antitrust 
division and by an administrative law judge that the agreement be 
turned down 
they had concluded that the newspapers losses resulted from 
pricing decisions and could be reduced if the newspapers raised 
prices to cover the cost of operating 
meese however said the free press with a 20cent newsstand 
price in the detroit area already was 5 cents higher than the 
news there is thus no competitive advantage to be gained by 
knightridder from a unilateral increase in prices meese said 
the joint operating agreement was the fifth approved by the 
justice department under the newspaper preservation act of 1970 
which allows limited antitrust exemption to preserve independent 
editorial voices in a community where one newspaper is in danger of 
failing 
previous partial mergers were approved for newspapers in 
anchorage alaska in 1974 cincinnati in 1979 chattanooga tenn 
in 1980 and seattle in 1982 
under the 100year joint operating agreement the free press 
will publish on weekday mornings and the news on weekday afternoons 
the newspapers will split responsibilities on weekends when a 
combined edition called the detroit news and free press will be 
published 
the agreement means a maximum 500 people at both papers could 
loose their jobs lawrence said a significant number have 
indicated they will take early retirement helping to hold down the 
layoffs lawrence said 
profits or losses the first five years of the agreement will be 
split under a sliding formula beginning with 55 percent for 
gannett and 45 percent for knightridder thereafter profits and 
losses will be split equally between the two corporations 
according to estimates released by knightridder in january the 
free press operating losses had totaled 100 million since 1979 
and that the news had lost about 75 million in the same period 
the free press circulation in march was 647763 daily and 
721676 on sundays according to the audit bureau of circulation 
the news circulation was 688211 daily and 836331 on sundays the 
bureau said 
the free press was founded in 1831 and purchased by a 
predecessor of knightridder in 1940 the news was founded in 1873 
and purchased by gannett in 1986

today on the chicago board of trade in reaction to a private crop 
analysts prediction of a sharp drop in corn and soybean production 
the widelyfollowed analyst conrad leslie of chicago pegged 1988

production of 191 billion bushels last year leslie estimated us

706 billion bushels harvested last year 
leslies numbers fell near the low end of other private 
estimates that have been released in advance of the agriculture 
departments estimate on thursday in its july crop report the 
usda pegged 1988 soybean production at 165 billion bushels and 
corn production at 52 billion bushels 
although traders are eagerly awaiting the usda report which 
will be based crop conditions as of aug 1 the official numbers 
may have little market impact said cathy leow an assistant vice 
president in charge of grain futures trading at thomson mckinnon 
securities inc in new york 
when the usda comes out with its number people are most 
likely going to say its too high because the survey was taken

at the end of a dusty milelong road to 
nowhere james and carolyn robertson walk across a field to their 
barn each morning and generate their harvest by hand 
you can probably find their produce at your corner bookstore 
the robertsons who left urban pressures behind 14 years ago for 
the solitude of rural mendocino county are living out their dreams 
with tiny but highly regarded yolla bolly press 
people are fascinated by the fact that two grownups would be 
out in the woods making books by hand by 19thcentury methods 
said jim robertson 
the wonderment is natural for any visitor making the 175mile 
trek from san francisco to round valley a remote farming plateau 
tucked amid the mountains of californias coast ranges 
thirty miles from the nearest town of any size and almost an 
hour from a major highway yolla bolly press sits next to pasture 
land in a spot better suited for a sheep barn than a printing barn 
the robertsons call it their book farm 
i had a dream long ago about a print shop in a garden and 
carolyn had a dream about a cabin in the woods explained jim 
53 we care deeply about books and are devoting our lives to 
them 
the press was christened with an indian name meaning high 
snowy peak for the 8000foot mountains of the nearby yolla 
bollymiddle eel wilderness its logo is an indian design 
commemorating the tree frog which frequents the robertsons 40 
acres along with mountains lions bears and the deer that nap daily 
in the shade of their guest cabin 
the choice of a distinctive name was meant to catch the 
attention of bookworms and the publishing community it has 
only about two dozen book printers in the united states use the 
letterpress printing method pressing raisedsurface type onto 
paper instead of the less costly more modern offset method 
experts say yolla bolly which also produces trade books for 
commercial publishers compares favorably with any maker of finely 
printed books 
theyre absolutely among the countrys top producers of fine 
limitededition books books that are a combination of craft art 
and literature said sandra kirshenbaum editor of fine print a 
san francisco quarterly magazine 
jim got an early start in the profession fascinated by print 
shops as a boy growing up in alameda on san francisco bay he 
received a tiny handoperated press and a case of type from his 
father one birthday by the seventh grade he was running a 
neighborhood newspaper called the pearl street gazette 
circulation 15 or 20 
he went on to run a graphicdesign business for about 15 years 
before returning to publishing 
carolyn 46 grew up a book lover in salt lake city with a 
background in english literature and business management she 
applied for work in jims san francisco office one day in 1968 and 
got the job and more 
ultimately they founded yolla bolly five years later before 
moving to covelo in 1974 in the interest of peace quiet and 
affordability today carolyn handles the business side jim is 
responsible for the printing and they share editing and design 
responsibilities 
we live on the edge in a wild and wonderful place is 
how carolyn describes their remote idyllic setup 
yolla bolly runs on equipment valued at a mere 25000 four 
letterpresses dating back 75 years two handoperated proofing 
presses and one small offset press 
but the two or three fine books produced each year command 
premium prices from collectors 
the most recent was my first summer in the sierra 
commemorating the 150th anniversary of naturalist john muirs 
birthday last april the press published 110 limitededition 
volumes for 785 each and 25 specialedition volumes for 1150 
months of preparation includes choosing the artist and preparing 
the art buying highquality paper from mills in italy and choosing 
california latigo saddle leather or perhaps amish horse denim for 
the binding 
the price restricts the audience for the limitededition books 
by muir joaquin miller robinson jeffers and others but the care 
that goes into making them ensures they are likely to be kept for a 
long time 
jim robertson sees books as icons that represent what is 
valued in a culture 
you can make a thing a book or a house or a camera in such 
a way that it commands respect he said 
i hate to think that the only people who care about the way 
things are made are a couple of oddball craftsmen out in the woods 
the culture needs the attitude of making things with purpose 
attention to detail and a certain kind of love 
because the printing of fine books can be a risky business 
yolla bolly also acts as an independent producer for four or five 
commercial books a year 
it does the design and preparation work and ships the books off 
to major publishers such as sierra club books and houghton mifflin 
co bestselling yolla bolly books include mountain light 
the view from the oak and stranger in the forest 
the robertsons hope to continue their mix of artistic and 
commercial work as long as readers keep buying 
we consider ourselves very lucky to live in a place like this 
do the things we care about and make a living jim robertson said

crocodile dundee might prefer to knock 
back a beer but wine drinkers around the world are toasting their 
fascination with life down under by sipping more australian wine 
than ever before 
the explosion of interest in australias premium labels has 
resulted in some shortages and higher prices as vintners struggle 
to keep pace with rising demand both here and overseas 
frost and hailstorms in some parts of south australia prior to 
the 1988 vintage also have cut into supplies 
many australians are drinking better quality wine said 
leading wine writer huon hooke of the sydney morning herald they 
want quality product but much of that product is committed 
overseas 
contributing to the popularity of aussie wines is the general 
bull market for things australian including actor paul hogan and 
his carefree crocodile dundee character ironically hogan can be 
seen in american television commercials turning up his nose to 
fine wine tasting in favor of a frothy glass of beer 
also aiding the australian industry is a trend away from 
european wines after the chernobyl nuclear disaster sparked fears 
of fallout across europe and scandals over illegal additives 
scarred the austrian wine industry 
statistics show domestic consumers are drinking a better class 
of wine and deserting the taditional cask or boxed wine wine 
sales in a country previously noted for its beer drinking have 
doubled over the past decade to 329 million liters last year 
the increased popularity of premium wines has led to price rises 
of up to 30 percent locally and arguments from australian retailers 
that producers should supply the local market ahead of the 
lucrative export markets of sweden the united states and britain 
the winemakers looking to the future are continuing to export 
enthusiastically 
australian wine is a competitor for californian wine in many 
markets it is particularly popular in northern europe accounting 
for 10 percent of all wine imports into sweden 7 million liters 
in the 198687 financial year 
britain imported 45 million liters that year and the figure is 
expected to rise considerably in 198788 
the australian wine and brandy corp the governmentfunded 
marketing authority said exports to japan were up 62 percent last 
year to 27 million liters 
dollar for dollar we offer the best value quality wine 
available around the world said brian mcguigan managing 
director of the highprofile wyndham estate group 
the australian bureau of statistics reports that wine exports 
now total over 30 million liters annually almost 10 percent of the 
total production 
we are having great difficulty in meeting the demand for our 
wines said jim williams director of trading for penfolds which 
makes grange hermitage australias worldclass red wine penfolds 
is the largest winemaking group in australia and the largest 
exporter 
grapes have been grown in australia since the first fleet of 
convict settlers arrived from england in 1788 the industry has 
been revolutionized over the past 20 years with the introduction of 
new technology which led to the production of highquality table 
wines 
but there is a great deal of resentment in the united 
kingdom warned chris anstee a spokesman for the lindemans 
group dealers feel they are being cheated having made an 
initial investment in promoting australian wine and being told 
australia cannot meet the demand 
that echoes complaints at home 
countries like argentina and chile are ready to service our 
consumers if the local industry cant meet local demands said 
lance hogan a buyer for a bulk distribution company 
industry analysts predict the undersupply of premium products 
which retail from around 5 us domestically could last for three 
to four years they also predict exports could rise to 25 percent 
of production within five years 
but some experts in the industry believe the current premium 
shortage will be shortlived and has been aggravated by the unusual 
weather 
we have better cheaper land here than anywhere in the 
northern hemisphere and our production costs are less said 
mcguigan 
the current shortage mainly of chardonnay is a temporary 
aberration with the potential we have we cant afford to stand 
still we are the worlds vineyard of the future 
there are now some 500 wineries spread across the country among 
the premier wineproducing districts are the barossa and clare 
valleys and mclaren vale in south australia the yarra valley in 
victoria and the hunter valley in new south wales there are 
numerous other small areas where grapes are grown 
despite tight supplies some winemakers believe now is the time 
to cultivate new customers the rosemount estate group headed by 
former international winemaker of the year philip shaw has set up 
offices in ignacio calif and britain and is currently exporting 
to japan canada and sweden among others 
rosemount is actively pursuing export markets said managing 
director chris hancock 
gordon grant managing director of the ryecroft company 
believes there are still huge opportunities for australian makers 
particularly in the united states market 
people overseas rarely know if they are eating australian 
beef or wearing australian wool but our wine is seen as an 
australian product said grant it is an ambassador in a 
glass

kansas city southern industries inc was 
trying to determine what its options are today after the interstate 
commerce commission approved the sale of the southern pacific 
railroad to rio grande industries 
kansas city southern which had offered to buy the southern 
pacific could challenge the icc ruling in court but the companys 
president and chief executive officer landon rowland said no 
decision has been made on what the next step if any would be 
were not ruling out anything rowland told reporters after 
the icc vote in washington dc 
rio grande industries has agreed to buy the southern pacific 
from santa fe southern pacific corp for 12 billion kansas city 
southern has offered to buy southern pacific for 125 billion 
but the icc in a 40 vote said the merger of the southern 
pacific and the denver amp rio grande western railroads would have 
the best competitive results and be in the public interest 
the commission last year ordered the santa fe southern pacific 
corp to divest itself of the southern pacific after the rejection 
of that railroads merger with the santa fe 
santa fe southern reached agreement with rio grande industries 
but when permission for the sale was sought from the icc kansas 
city southern objected and sought to buy southern pacific as well 
in a series of votes today the icc turned its back on the 
kansas city southern proposal and approved the sale to rio grande 
industries instead 
meanwhile a threejudge court is scheduled to meet friday in 
kansas city to consider kcsis application for a stay of a recent 
order barring the company from completing its efforts to purchase 
southern pacific according to eighth circuit court of appeals 
judge pasco bowman 
bowman told attorneys in kansas city that when a south dakota 
judge friday prohibited the company from buying southern pacific 
he also delayed the prohibition from taking effect until after it 
could be appealed 
bowmans observation came after a short hearing monday morning 
he said a temporary stay on the prohibition preventing it from 
taking effect was to last until next tuesday 
a federal judge in sioux falls sd last week blocked kcsi 
from buying southern pacific railroad judge john b jones said 
kansas city southern could not buy southern pacific while it is 
appealing a 600 million judgment the state of south dakota has 
against kansas city southern 
the judge ruled for south dakota officials who argued that the 
purchase might jeopardize the recovery of their judgment in the 
antitrust lawsuit 
but kansas city southern officials say the purchase would 
enhance the value of their company rather than harm it 
south dakota won the judgment in a suit alleging kansas city 
southern helped kill a 38 billion coalslurry pipeline that would 
have helped the states economy the state contended kansas city 
southern worked against the project because it would have hurt the 
railroads business 
the pipeline plan was dropped in 1984

unfair competition of late has become associated 
with trade restrictions that limit access of american manufacturers 
to foreign markets but it isnt always so 
you dont need to leave these shores to find it unfair 
practices occur with regularity on the domestic business scene 
sometimes with the blessing of high government officials 
potentially one of the biggest such scrapes of all involves 
three of the nations biggest institutions the us government 
general motors corp and international business machines corp 
in a blistering complaint to government gm asserts that the 
federal government among other things held it to a higher set of 
standards than required of ibm which helped ibm bid lowest to win 
a 36 billion contract 
after the award gms hughes aircraft co said it discovered the 
government allowed ibm to include used computer equipment in its 
bid while telling hughes it could use only new equipment 
earlier this year gm challenged a us postal service award to 
perot systems corp involving a quest for postal savings that would 
be made by perot over a 10year period the reason the award was 
made without bidding 
gm has won the first round in that battle with the general 
services administration ruling the award was granted to perot in 
the face of clear knowledge that other companies existed with 
competency in this sort of work 
in the past the combatants in such disputes over government 
contracts often involved big companies vs small with the latter 
charging that government specifications put small businesses at a 
disadvantage 
legislation has alleviated much of the problem but some 
smallbusiness organizations still contend that specifications 
such as for quantities of a product or delivery times still put 
them at a disadvantage 
an area of continued friction involves taxexempt nonprofit 
organizations such as museums and universities that compete with 
small businesses in the commercial marketplace 
this competition may be getting worse and could result in 
legislation 
it arises partly from the fact that since 1946 nonprofits have 
increased from about 100000 to more than 860000 and from growing 
financial pressures on many of these institutions 
it manifests itself in myriad ways in a museum that publishes a 
slick magazine a college bookstore that sells apparel furniture 
or travel services a hospital that operates a pharmacy gift shop 
or health spa 
while this competition between profitseeking and nonprofit 
operations seems to be growing more intense the definitions that 
separate them seem insufficient to the purpose 
as they exist the tax laws allow a nonprofit organization to 
engage in commercial activities not subject to taxes if the 
activities are substantially related to the purpose of the 
nonprofit institution 
such wording it is argued is more an invitation to lawyers and 
suits than a guide for business 
operators of small businesses complain that the ability of 
nonprofits to exist without justifying themselves financially 
gives them an enormous competitive advantage which is then 
compounded by their freedom from taxes 
adding to the frustration they say is halo effect of 
nonprofits or the widespread perception among the public that 
nonprofits by their very nature have qualities superior to 
commercial operations

the federal reserve board announced today it 
is boosting its key bank lending rate from 6 percent to 65 
percent raising the possibility that other interest rates 
including those on credit cards and mortgages will go higher too 
the fed in a statement said its decision reflects the intent 
of the federal reserve to reduce inflationary pressures and was 
taken in light of the growing spread of market interest rates over 
the discount rate 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan 
administration officials were disappointed by the action 
it was the first change in the central banks discount rate 
since sept 4 and put the rate at its highest in more than two 
years 
the increase effective immediately set the discount rate 
which is the fee the fed charges to make loans to us financial 
institutions at its highest level since april 21 1986 when it 
fell to 65 percent from 7 percent 
analysts had expected the fed to tighten its reins on the money 
supply this week but few were expecting an increase in the 
discount rate which is the most dramatic move the fed can take 
most were expecting the fed to push up the federal funds rate 
the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans by an 
eighth or a quarter of a percentage point from its current 775 
percent 
david wyss an economist with data resources inc a lexington 
mass consulting firm said he had not expected a discount rate 
increase from the fed board all appointees of president reagan 
until after the november elections but he said the fed acted now 
rather than in the fall when the gop presidential campaign of vice 
president george bush is in full swing 
i think the timing is very deliberate to do it before the 
republican convention thats sort of the kick off for the 
republican political ampaign and raising the discount rate now may 
be seen as better than interrupting the campaign wyss said 
reagans spokesman marlin fitzwater said the white house was 
naturally disappointed but he also told reporters 
the federal reserve has had the task of trying to balance the 
resistance to inflationary pressures with maintenance of real 
growth in the economy we believe the federal reserve has been 
doing a good job of balancing these interests 
the likely negative effects of the hike include pushing up the 
value of the dollar which could slow the improvement of the us 
trade deficit wyss said the dollar has been appreciating against 
foreign currencies since early this year and now stands at an 
18month high against the west german mark it was the previous 
fall in the value of the dollar that shrank the trade deficit 
wyss also said that the increase now will likely make government 
borrowing this week more costly the treasury department in its 
quarterly auctions plans to sell 11 billion in 10year notes 
today and 11 billion in threeyear notes on wednesday 
tuesdays discount rate increase marked the second under the 
reign of alan greenspan who took over as fed chairman a year ago 
in september the central bank boosted the rate from 55 percent to 
6 percent the first increase in three years 
that move was also taken in response to inflationary fears but 
was later cited by some analysts as a contributing factor to the 
october stock market crash 
after the crash the fed pumped liquidity into the banking 
system it loosened money supplies again in midwinter when rising 
business inventories raised concern that the economy was softening 
since then however government statistics have portrayed a 
strong economy and concern has shifted from recession to inflation 
tight labor markets in some areas of the country has been sparking 
worry about inflationary increases in wages some economists say 
steadily rising factory operating rates are likely to contribute to 
rising prices for manufactured goods 
last month greenspan said in congressional testimony that the 
fed at this juncture might be well advised to err more on the 
side of restrictiveness rather than of stimulus 
at that hearing before the senate banking committee on july 13 
greenspan had played down the prospect of an immediate increase in 
the discount rate after he was asked if he were worried about the 
growing gap between the discount rate and the federal funds rate 
which had been increased in a series of small steps since late 
march 
greenspan replied that current relationships are 
satisfactory and noted that the spread had been greater in the 
past 
too great a spread between the rates tempts banks to misuse the 
discount window by borrowing from the fed and lending to other 
banks 
in its statement today the federal reserve board said it 
increased the discount rate in response to requests from federal 
reserve banks in boston new york philadelphia cleveland 
richmond va atlanta st louis kansas city mo and san 
francisco 
as inflationary concerns have mounted in financial markets 
other interest rates including mortgage rates have been 
increasing the prime rate the rate charged by banks to their most 
creditworthy customers was raised by most major banks on july 14 
from 9 percent to 95 percent its highest since march 1986 
wyss said a further increase in the prime rate could come this 
week 
among the recent signs of strength in the economy was the july 
unemployment rate which at 54 percent was near its 14year lows 
in addition the monthly trade deficits for april and may were the 
lowest in nearly three years 
prior to september the last increase in the discount rate had 
come april 6 1984 when the rate was boosted from 85 percent to 9 
percent 
the rate was then cut seven successive times with the last 
reduction on aug 20 1986 when it dropped from 6 percent to 55 
percent the lowest level in nearly a decade

president reagan will sign the 39 billion 
drought relief bill after the house gives final approval to it the 
white house announced today 
farmers now know that assistance is on the way fitzwater 
said in confirming reagans expected approval 
the announcement was unusual since the white house ordinarily 
does not say what action the president will take on a bill until 
after it has reached his desk 
fitzwater said plans were not complete but a ceremony would 
probably be held in connection with the signing of the bill 
the senate gave its assent monday on a 920 vote just a few 
minutes earlier the house cleared the way for expedited 
consideration of the measure which could come as early as today 
theres no question about passage rep kika de la garza 
dtexas chairman of the house agriculture committee said monday 
its just by how many votes 
the measure the biggest federal emergency relief bill ever 
passed for farmers is aimed at the hundreds of thousands of 
farmers and ranchers who have been buffeted by one of the worst 
droughts in the nations history growers in the eastern cornbelt 
and the northern plains have been hit particularly hard 
according to the department of agriculture 43 percent of the 
country was suffering from severe or extreme drought in midjuly 
the fourth worst percentage since the government began keeping the 
statistics in 1895 the highest measurement was made in 1934 when 
61 percent of the nations area was similarly parched 
the government estimated last month that the countrys corn crop 
will be down from a normal year by 29 percent barley production 
down 42 percent oats down 43 percent and spring wheat down 51 
percent 
the agriculture department has estimated that the governments 
regular farm payments would be about 7 billion lower than expected 
this year not including the cost of this bill because of the 
drought supporters of the legislation say those savings will more 
than pay for the costs of the assistance 
president reagan is expected to sign the bill quickly 
department of agriculture officials say they believe it will take 
about two months for the assistance to reach the farmers 
governors from farm states meeting at the national governors 
association conference in cincinnati unanimously approved a 
resolution monday praising congress for the quick action 
the legislation that congress is set to pass is excellent 
farreaching legislation that provides assistance to livestock and 
crop producers the resolution by the governors committee on 
agriculture and rural development said 
the legislation would let growers who lose up to 35 percent of 
their crops because of the drought keep the deficiency payments 
they have already received in advance normally they have to repay 
the government if crop prices rise as they have because of the 
drought 
farmers losing more than 35 percent of their crop would be 
entitled to an emergency payment of 65 percent of their expected 
federal subsidy or of the anticipated market price of the crop up 
to 100000 those farmers however would have to repay their 
advance deficiency payments 
farmers would receive aid covering 90 percent of their 
droughtcaused damage for all losses they suffer beyond 
threefourths of their crop 
farmers who raise food animals such as livestock and poultry 
would get federal help in paying for up to half the costs of 
replacement feed bought during the drought if they normally grow 
their own the dry weather has driven up the prices of grain that 
farmers must feed their herds 
the measure would not provide assistance to food animal 
producers who normally buy their feed rather than raising their 
own 
the government would be allowed to sell its own lowcost feed to 
farmers donate feed to producers unable to buy it and reimburse 
farmers for up to half of some of their feed transportation costs 
and their expenses for deepening their wells 
dairy pricesupport levels would be raised in april through june 
1989 by 50 cents to 1110 for each 100 pounds of milk a 50cent 
reduction in the price support planned for jan 1 would be 
abandoned 
the secretary of agriculture would be empowered to begin a 
program for aiding producers of ethanol a fuel additive by 
permitting them to buy cheaper governmentowned corn the 
agriculture department would be allowed to make 12 million bushels 
of corn available for the program 
to help the government recoup the costs of future farm problems 
the bill would require farmers to buy federal crop insurance for 
1989 if their losses this year exceed 65 percent of their normal 
crops 
the bill also has provisions encouraging soil and water 
conservation and providing aid to farmers harmed by recent hail 
storms and hurricanes

prosecutors have accused a teenager who dropped 
out of high school with using his home computer to steal more than 
1 million in software from atampt and the government and they plan 
go after other violators 
this is not malicious mischief said us attorney anton 
valukas in announcing the federal charges on monday its a 
felony 
charges brought against herbert zinn jr 18 of chicago signal 
the start of an aggressive position toward computer crimes 
valukas said 
the government also accused the young man of advertising on a 
computer bulletin board how to electronically break into atampts 
computers he was charged in a criminal information 
zinn is accused of committing the crimes when he was a juvenile 
and could be sent to prison until his 21st birthday in august 1991 
he could not be reached tuesday at his north side residence 
where his telephone went unanswered 
federal agents raided his home last year and confiscated three 
computers and software allegedly stolen during the electronic 
breakins and zinn has not pursued his computer techniques with 
quite the same vim and vigor he told the chicago suntimes 
he said he nonetheless hoped eventually to resume his schooling 
and become an electonics engineer the newspaper said zinn would 
not discuss details of the case it said 
the federal charges arose after zinn had been arrested several 
times including for allegedly breaking into the computers at the 
keller graduate school of management and at commodity perspective 
inc both in chicago 
before and after the computer breakins at keller and 
commodity perspective zinn was by his own admission breaking 
into atampt computers valukas said 
court documents indicate zinn broke into an atampt computer at the 
north atlantic treaty organizations maintenance and supply 
headquarters in burlington nc and an atampt computer at robins 
air force base ga 
software taken from nato and the air force base were low level 
in terms of sensitivity valukas said 
agents raided zinns home after an atampt security officer tuned 
into the socalled phreak class2600 computer bulletin board and 
spotted messages signed by shadow hawk a code name the 
goverment said the teenager used 
in the messages shadow hawk bragged that he had successfully 
gained access to atampt computer files in another similar message 
shadow hawk made the mistake of including his telephone number 
which was spotted by a security officer the government said 
the purpose of the texasbased phreak class2600 is to educate 
computer enthusiasts to penetrate industrial and government 
sector computer systems said william j cook an assistant us 
attorney 
zinn also tried to electonically break into computers at the

order to freeze the assets of six men charged with racketeering in 
an alleged phony stock trading scheme 
in rejecting the defendants request for a stay judge ralph k 
winter of the 2nd us circuit court of appeals left intact a 
federal district judges freeze order winter set an aug 17 date 
for a threejudge panel in new york to hear an appeal 
the 2nd circuit which covers the states of new york 
connecticut and vermont and usually sits in new york city is in 
recess winter agreed to hear arguments in new haven where he 
maintains his office 
five of the defendants in the racketeering case are top officers 
of princetonnewport an investment partnership based in princeton 
nj and newport beach calif the sixth is a former bond trader 
for drexel burnham lambert inc the wall street investment firm 
last friday us district judge louis j stanton in manhattan 
issued a restraining order freezing some of the defendants assets 
which would be subject to forfeiture if they are convicted of 
racketeering 
the district judge had barred the government from distributing 
copies of his freeze order pending a hearing on the appeal 
but under winters ruling the government was permitted to 
distribute copies to almost two dozen financial institutions 
partnerships and corporations including goldman sachs co 
united jersey bank kidder peabody co bear stearns co and 
morgan stanley amp co 
federal prosecutors had sought a much broader release of the 
order 
we wanted it to be distributed to everybody said bruce a 
baird an assistant us attorney 
the assets ordered frozen include those owned by the defendants 
the order prohibits princetonnewport which was not named as a 
defendant from diluting any of its assets but does not bar any 
transactions that are considered part of the normal course of 
business 
more than 200 million is invested with the partnership and its 
subsidiaries by limited partners not named in the case 
lawyers for those entities not named as defendants argued the 
freeze order was too broad and that the district court went beyond 
its authority in freezing the assets of entities not named as 
defendants 
the six were named last thursday in a 35count indictment on 
charges of racketeering and conspiracy the first time a 
racketeering charge has been leveled against securities traders

wire fraud conspiracy to make false stock trades in order to create 
phony longterm capital gains and shortterm capital losses for 
princetonnewport 
the indictment charged there was a scheme involving the bogus 
sale of securities between princetonnewport and drexel to create 
more than 13 million in phony tax losses and avoid regulatory 
disclosure requirements

the kuwait investment office the investment arm 
of the kuwaiti government said tuesday it signed legal documents 
pledging to limit its stake in british petroleum co plc to its 
current 2168percent level 
however trade secretary lord young refused to accept the 
documents and returned them on grounds they would be prejudicial 
in a review of the stake by the monopolies and mergers commission 
the department of trade and industry said 
the commission which currently is reviewing the kuwaiti holding 
in bp is expected to decide by sept 2 whether the stake is 
anticompetitive or against the national interest 
young is to decide what action to take in light of the 
commissions findings 
the londonbased kuwaiti office said it also pledged not to 
exercise voting rights representing more than 149 percent of the 
oil giants shares 
the office also promised not to use its stake to further any 
other commercial or political interest of kuwait 
in addition the office agreed not to seek representation on 
bps board of directors and not to oppose the election of any bp 
board members proposed by the board 
the kuwaiti offices law firm stephenson harwood said the 
pledges were designed to make legally binding the assurances which 
the office already has given to the british government about its bp 
stake 
in order to put beyond doubt that it regards itself as bound 
by the assurances already given the state of kuwait has entered 
into binding covenants intended to be enforceable by the british 
government in the british courts which confirm that its interest 
in bp is that of an investor only stephenson harwood said 
the kuwaiti office stressed the legal documents were signed 
entirely on its own initiative and not under pressure from the 
british government or commission 
the office began aquiring the stake in british petroleum 
piecemeal after the government sold off its remaining 315 percent 
stake in the oil company last fall the 75 billionpound or 13 
billion share sale coincided with the stock market crash which 
depressed the market price of the oil companys stock

investors dumped stocks and bonds tuesday but 
the dollar rallied smartly against major foreign currencies after 
the federal reserve boosted its key bank lending rate a half 
percentage point for the first time since black monday 
the increase in the discount rate to 65 percent from 6 
percent was made to reduce inflationary pressures and in 
light of the growing spread of market interest rates over the 
discount rate according to the fed 
many economists predicted other interest rates including those 
on mortgages or homeequity loans would rise as a result of the 
feds credit tightening and a few market watchers worried about 
the nearterm effects on the already skittish stock market 
the increase in the discountrate the fee the central bank 
charges member banks for loans was the second since alan 
greenspan replaced paul a volcker at the feds helm a year ago on 
sept 4 the central bank raised the rate for the first time in 
three years to 6 percent from 55 percent 
while last septembers increase in the rate also was taken in 
response to inflationary fears analysts later cited it as a 
contributing factor to the oct 19 stock market crash 
i just hope history doesnt repeat itself said irwin 
kellner chief economist for manufacturers hanover trust co i 
dont look for a market collapse but the crosscurrents of the 
stock market arent very favorable it certainly is dangerous 
on wall street stock prices fell sharply in response to the 
announcement with the dow jones average of 30 industrials losing 
slightly more than 28 points to 207913 it had been down nearly 
40 points late in the day 
bond prices tumbled while interest rates rose the treasurys 
bellwether 30year issue was off about 10 per 1000 face amount 
while its yield jumped to 919 percent from 910 percent late 
monday 
in foreign exchange the dollar advanced strongly against major 
currencies higher interest rates make the dollar more valuable 
the biggest increases came against the japanese yen and west 
german marks by late afternoon tuesday the dollar had broken 
through the psychologically important 135yen level from mondays 
new york close of 13397 and to 192 marks from 190 
analysts had expected the fed to tighten its reins on the money 
supply this week but few were expecting an increase in the 
discount rate which is the most dramatic move the fed can take 
tuesdays increase brings the discount rate to its steepest 
level since april 1986 when it fell to 65 percent from 7 percent 
the credit markets have been screaming for a discount rate 
increase for quite some time the surprise was in the timing of 
it said kellner 
not only is the republican convention coming up but were in 
the middle of a treasury refunding in which the government is 
auctioning off 22 billion in new three and 10year notes this 
week to pay off its old debts 
i dont think inflation is any worse today than it was last 
year said kellner 
but robert a brusca chief financial economist for nikko 
securities co international inc defended the discount rate hike 
the economy has been doing well but inflation has ben creeping 
up he said its the feds job to throw cold water on the 
economy when it starts overheating and thats what it appears to be 
doing right now 
among the recent signs of strength in the economy was the july 
unemployment rate which at 54 percent was near its 14year lows 
concerns about inflation have pushed interest rates higher in 
recent months the federal funds rate which is the interest on 
overnight loans between banks has been on the rise elizabeth g 
reiners an economist at dean witter reynolds inc said the yield 
spread between the fed funds rate and discount rate had been at its 
highest level in about a year 
a month ago major banks boosted their prime lending rates a 
half percentage point to 95 percent from 9 percent 
i wouldnt be surprised if we had another prime rate hike by 
friday said david resler chief economist nomura securities inc

rio grande industries inc received government 
approval tuesday for its 12 billion purchase of the southern 
pacific railroad one of the nations oldest rail lines with track 
stretching from oregon to louisiana 
southern pacific which has 15000 miles of track will retain 
its name and incorporate into its operations the smaller denver amp 
rio grande western railroad once the purchase is completed company 
officials said 
by a 40 vote the interstate commerce commission gave approval 
for the railroads sale by its parent sante fe southern pacific 
corp to rio grande industries a subsidiary of the denverbased 
anschutz corp 
philip anschutz owner of the privately held company told 
reporters he intends to concentrate on reducing southern pacifics 
debts partly through the sale of some of its real estate holdings 
and modernize the railroads equipment and facilities 
we will be in the railroad business first and foremost 
said anschutz whose background is in energy 
anschutz who has a reputation of being reclusive acknowledged 
that he had never before held a news conference but he said he 
wanted to meet with reporters to set to rest unfounded rumors 
including one that sought the southern pacific to break it up and 
make a quick profit 
its very important that this company be kept together he 
said 
the anschutz corp purchased rio grande industries four years 
ago 
william holtman chairman of rio grande industries expressed 
confidence in anschutzs devotion to railroading hes a 
longterm player holtman said of anschutz 
the icc said the merger of the southern pacific and the denver amp 
rio grande western railroads would have the best competitive 
benefits and be in the public interest the merger was recommended 
by both the justice department and the transportation department 
the commission last year ordered the chicagobased santa fe 
southern pacific corp to divest itself of either the southern 
pacific or the santa fe railroads after it rejected a proposal to 
merge the two rail lines the company chose to sell the southern 
pacific 
southern pacifics stock has been held in a trust for nearly 
five years pending the outcome of the battle over who should own 
the railroad 
we look forward to completing the sale getting out of 
trusteeship and moving forward again with a clear idea of southern 
pacifics future course and direction said denman mcnear 
chairman of the southern pacific transportation co 
anschutz said the southern pacifics management team would be 
chosen from among the senior managers of both the southern pacific 
and the denver amp rio grande western 
santa fe southern reached agreement with rio grande industries 
on the sale last february but when permission for the transaction 
was sought from the icc another railroad company kansas city 
southern industries objected and asked that it be allowed to buy 
the railroad 
but the icc in a series of votes tuesday turned its back on the 
kansas city southern proposal one concern of the icc was kansas 
city southerns financial outlook in light of a 600 million court 
judgment that is under appeal 
the judgment stems from antitrust and contract violations 
involving a coalslurry pipeline project in south dakota kansas 
city southern had argued that the judgment would not affect its 
ability to finance the southern pacific purchase 
kansas city southern could challenge the icc ruling in court 
but the companys president and chief executive officer landon 
rowland said no decision has been made on what the next step if 
any would be 
were not ruling out anything rowland told reporters after 
the icc vote 
the southern pacific which is rich in history operates up and 
down the west coast and along the southern tier of the country with 
tracks stretching from portland ore through central california 
and across the southwest as far east as new orleans it also 
operates lines from san francisco to ogden utah where it links up 
with the denver amp rio grande western and from st louis to the 
gulf coast 
the denver amp rio grande runs along a central corridor from ogden 
to st louis 
both railroads have been closely intertwined with the history of 
the west helping to bring in settlers miners and industry 
southern pacifics founders helped drive the golden spike in 
utah in 1869 linking the countrys first transcontinental rail 
line two years later the denver amp rio grande ran its first train 
from denver to colorado springs 
anschutz said the new railroad will operate under the banner 
of southern pacific although within the company the denver amp rio 
grande western will continue to maintain its own identity 
he said he decided to retain the southern pacific name because 
it is by far the larger of the two railroads and probably better 
known last of all i like the name he added

the stock market fell deep into negative 
territory today in reaction to news that the federal reserve 
boosted its key bank lending rate but equities managed to finish 
off their worst levels 
the fed announced shortly after the opening bell that it was 
hiking the discount rate a half a percentage point to 65 percent 
its highest level in more than two years stock prices immediately 
headed south 
an increase in the discount rate which is the fee the fed 
charges for shortterm loans to member banks is the central banks 
most direct way of pushing interest rates higher as a curb on 
economic growth jumps in other interest rates including those on 
mortgage rates and credit cards are likely to follow 
analysts were cautiously optimistic that the market which had 
been anticipating higher interest rates could digest the hike in 
the coming days they reasoned that with the dollar up sharply on 
the announcement foreign funds will shift into dollardenominated 
instruments like stocks and bonds 
eugene peroni a technical analyst at janney montgomery scott in 
philadelphia noted that volume minus dividendcapturing 
strategies was moderate and that there was no sign of any panic 
selling 
a few investors took the opportunity to hunt for bargains and 
even considered the news somewhat positive the feeling is that 
the sooner the medicine is administered the quicker the patient 
will recover said michael metz vice president and technical 
analyst at oppenheimer amp co 
he also said the action enhances the feds credibility among 
those who thought the central bank would refrain from making any 
decisive moves before novembers presidential election

a former gillette co stockholder filed suit in 
federal court tuesday claiming thousands of shareholders lost money 
because they sold stock after gillette used a misleading 
advertisement in a proxy fight against a new york investment firm 
the class action suit is the latest chapter in a sevenmonth 
saga involving coniston groups failed efforts to gain control of 
the personal care giant that appeared over when the parties settled 
out of court last week 
the suit filed in us district court on behalf of former 
gillette shareholder harold brown claims conistons slate of 
candidates to the gillette board was defeated in the april 21 proxy 
vote because of a gillette advertisement questioning the investment 
firms makeup 
the defendants intended to and did create a false and 
misleading impression that conistons slate of candidates should 
not be elected and would not be able to sell gillette at a 
premium over market prices which misstatements deflated the market 
prices of gillette common stock the suit states 
coniston which had acquired 58 percent of gillettes 112 
million outstanding shares had sought to gain a third of 
gillettes 12member board and then sell the razor blade maker to 
the highest bidder 
the suit claims at least several thousand persons took a 
loss when they dumped gillette shares after the company won the 
proxy battle it seeks unspecified compensation for the losses 
gillette stock which had been trading around 40 a share before 
the vote dipped to a low of about 36 in the days after gillette 
announced a narrow victory on may 3 analysts said 
but the stock climbed back to over 40 after us district judge 
mark l wolf ruled july 7 that the ad was misleading and later said 
he was inclined to order a new election the stock nosedived again 
immediately after the two sides on aug 1 announced a settlement in 
which gillette agreed to buy back an estimated 16 million shares 
from coniston at 45 each or about 720 million 
gillette stock fell 37 cents a share to 35 in composite 
trading tuesday on the new york stock exchange 
the lawsuit claims that in the three days after the ad was 
published gillette received 642000 proxies revoking prior ballots 
submitted for coniston the difference would have closed a 52 
percent to 48 percent gap but not reversed the outcome 
the suit represents people who lost money selling gillette stock 
between april 19 the date of the advertisements and july 6 when 
wolf ruled that the ads contained false and misleading 
information about coniston 
the ads which appeared in the new york times and the wall 
street journal said coniston was controlled by a complicated 
web of foreign and domestic firms involved in its effort to 
control gillette 
as a result of that the proposal was defeated and the stock 
dropped said david berger a prominent philadelphia securities 
lawyer who is representing brown an attorney with an office in 
boston in order to minimize the damage my client sold out 
stockholders expectations were conistons proposal would be 
have been approved by the shareholders and the stock would have 
gone up 
berger said brown sold all of his more than 20000 shares of 
gillette stock after the company withstood the coniston bid 
gillette spokesman david fausch said about the suit were not 
surprised this is a litigious world 
analysts said they did not expect the latest legal challenge to 
gillette to affect the company 
i think its without merit said harry e wells iii of adams 
harkness stocks move around and elections are won and lost if 
youre going to play the game youve got to be a big boy 
gillette filed suit on april 14 claiming coniston falsified sec 
filings and failed to fully disclose its investors conistons 
countersuit filed five days later charged gillette with 
misrepresentation in the advertisements 
conistons suit was heard first in a nonjury trial gillettes 
case against coniston was in pretrial stages when the sides 
settled

steve van gorder and rick fahs see the 
future of the american fishing industry in farmers barns and 
abandoned innercity buildings 
van gorder and fahs cofounders of freshculture systems inc 
say theyve developed a way to raise 40000 pounds of fish a year 
in tanks fitting in 5000 square feet of space 
i think people will pay more for a topquality product they 
feel safe with van gorder said reports of medical waste and 
other pollution in the nations waters has spurred increasing 
worries among consumer about the fish they buy he added 
the freshculture system which sells for about 125000 is the 
first to reduce energy costs enough to economically raise 
freshwater fish indoors in the northeast and midwest van gorder 
and fahs claim 
striped bass salmon and other fish grown in the systems 15 
cylindrical tanks can be sold to restaurants and fish markets to 
meet the growing demand for fish they say 
increasingly health conscious americans have been eating more 
fish in recent years consumption per capita has grown from 123 
pounds in 1982 to 154 pounds last year according to the national 
marine fisheries service 
christian herr a program administrator with the state bureau of 
agricultural development said the technology used in the 
freshculture system is new 
we definitely see that it will be able to be used by our 
pennsylvania farmers that want to diversify herr said 
fahs a 35yearold former plant manager with general mills 
inc said fish farming also could bring industry back to inner 
cities 
you can put this in a burned out building theyre selling for 
a dollar he said 
fish farming itself is not new 
catfish have been raised in outdoor ponds for about 20 years 
trout also is farmed outdoors in idaho and elsewhere and 
striped bass is raised in tanks in california and elsewhere 
unlike these systems freshculture recirculates almost all the 
water in the tanks said van gorder 36 who has been researching 
aquaculture for 10 years 
it also costs little to heat one of the main stumbling blocks 
of previous systems with recirculating water he said 
in a small building in kutztown a rural eastern pennsylvania 
town fahs and van gorder are raising striped bass trout and 
tilapia in one of their systems they say they hope to begin 
selling their fish to restaurants in january 
a 2 horsepower motor pumps air to the 2000gallon tanks and 
pushes the water filters for them while a computer monitors water 
temperature and heats the tanks overnight when energy costs are 
lower van gorder said 
during a power outage a backup gaspowered air pump is 
activated he added 
trout and salmon require temperatures from 60 to 70 degrees 
while striped bass and tilapia need 80degree water according to 
van gorder 
fahs said fish can be produced in six months for about 250 a 
pound after startup costs with proper management and sold for 5 
or more to restaurants in the new york city and elsewhere in the 
northeast 
aquatic systems inc a san diegobased company expects to 
harvest 650000 pounds of striped bass this year from a fish farm 
in mecca calif near palm springs said timothy hovanec an 
assistant production manager 
unlike freshcultures system aquatic systems has geothermally 
heated tanks and only recirculates some of the water hovanec said 
i may be unnecessarily skeptical but there are at least 20 or 
30 people trying to get into striped bass he said 
van gorder and fahs say they expect the skepticism 
there are a lot of systems on paper fahs acknowledges 
but they say they are confident their approach will attract 
customers 
its the freshest nonpolluted source of fish you can get 
van gorder said

for the manufacture of the chemical at two texas facilities 
chevron plans to expand capacity for the manufacture of polymer 
grade propylene at its port arthur refinery and cedar bayou olefins 
plant in texas the company said in a statement 
polymer grade propylene is a high purity building block chemical 
used to make other materials such as polypropylene which is 
extensively used in plastic automobile parts toys medical 
products and appliances 
chevron remains strongly committed to the polymer grade 
propylene business said george scott vice president of chevron 
chemical co and general manager of the olefins amp derivatives 
division 
the domestic and international propylene consuming businesses 
have been expanding rapidly in the past two years especially 
polypropylene this expansion assures that we will be able to keep 
pace with that growth said scott 
the expansions to be constructed in two stages will add about 
350 million pounds to the companys annual capacity to produce 
polymer grade propylene the total capacity will be 13 billion 
pounds per year 
the first stage is scheduled to begin in october and will boost 
capacity at subsidiary chevron chemical cos olefins amp derivatives 
division plant at cedar bayou by about 20 percent to 800 million 
pounds by adding propylene splitting towers to its ethylene unit 
the second stage anticipated to begin during the fourth quarter 
of 1989 will boost capacity at subsidiary chevron usas port 
arthur refinery by more than 180 million pounds per year by adding 
a new propylene upgrading unit 
the company said expansion at the two facilities will be 
complemented by installation of a new olefin splitter and export 
facility at chevron usas pascagoula miss refinery designed 
to separate and transport dilute propylene to texas for further

a federal maritime commission finding that 
industry rules for containerized ships unfairly discriminate 
against small cargo shippers was upheld tuesday by a federal 
appeals court 
the us circuit court of appeals here said the maritime 
commission correctly ignored the rules effect on labormanagement 
relations when it found they improperly forced small shippers to 
employ unionized dock workers to handle their cargo 
it is not the national labor policy to allow otherwise 
unlawful activity merely because an employer and a union have 
agreed to it in mandatory collective bargaining a threejudge 
panel of the court said in a unanimous ruling 
at issue are rules first negotiated in 1968 by the international 
longshoremens association and the shipping industry that require 
unionized dockhands to load or unload cargo containers that pass 
through east coast ports 
the rules exempt manufacturers and large shippers that load 
cargo into containers at their own warehouses 
but small shippers whose cargo would not fill a single 
container are forced to lease containers from the shipping 
companies and deliver their goods for loading at a unionized pier 
the regulations were negotiated as part of the industrys 
efforts to introduce cargo containers which can be unloaded from a 
ship into a railroad car or a flatbed truck without being opened 
by dock hands 
the widespread use of containers has greatly reduced the number 
of longshoremen needed to unload ships and the rules were 
implemented to help the ila cut the losses to its workforce 
last year the maritime commission unanimously struck down the 
regulations which were challenged by freight forwarders trucking 
companies and handlers of small amounts of cargo 
the commissions finding however was stayed while the ila and 
the shipping industry appealed the decision 
john hammon executive vice president of the national customs 
brokers and forwarders association of america inc hailed the 
courts decision saying the rules amount to flagrant 
featherbeading that was just very damaging to importexport 
commerce 
there was on immediate comment from the ila which is expected 
to appeal the decision to the supreme court 
the ruling could also become a bargaining chip in contract 
negotiations between the ila and the shipping industry 
the regulations require that merchandise placed on containers 
within 50 miles of a port by nonila workers had to be unloaded on 
the dock and placed into different containers before it was loaded 
on ships 
the rules mean extra costs in delays and exposure to 
pilferage hammon said small cargo shippers have begun using 
canadian ports to avoid the restrictions resulting in less 
business for east coast ports he said

the dollar advanced strongly on domestic and 
foreign markets tuesday after the federal reserve surprised traders 
by increasing its discount rate 
gold prices fell republic national bank of new york quoted a 
bid of 42690 a troy ounce as of 4 pm edt down from 43020 
late monday 
raising rates in the face of a strong dollar probably was not 
expected said rick gomes a vice president at irving trust co 
traders had not expected the fed to increase the discount rate 
the fee the central bank charges for shortterm loans to member 
banks because the dollar has been strong gomes said 
investors bought the dollar because higher interest rates make 
it more valuable 
gomes said it was possible the major industrial countries known 
as the group of seven the united states is one were putting 
their monetary policies ahead of their currencies gomes said there 
were rumors in the market that west germany japan and other g7 
countries might follow the feds lead and increase their own 
interest rates 
but earl i johnson a vice president at harris trust amp co in 
chicago said foreign interest rate hikes would not stop the 
dollars upswing 
the only thing to put a cap on the dollar would be central 
bank selling he said 
johnson called the fed move confirmation of the economys 
strength 
the feds board voted unanimously to increase the disount rate 
to 65 percent from 6 percent the increase which took effect 
immediately was the first change in the rate since sept 4 and put 
the rate at its highest in more than two years 
an increase in the discount rate is the central banks most 
direct way of pushing interest rates higher as a curb on economic 
growth economists have been concerned in recent months that 
continuing economic growth could spark a new round of inflation 
partly because of the countrys low unemployment high production 
levels and the midwestern drought

the stock market fell sharply tuesday following 
the federal reserves surprise hike in its key bank lending rate 
which sparked fears that interest rates may be headed even higher 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials which had been off 
nearly 40 points closed down 2827 at 207913 its fourth

dividendrelated trading nationwide consolidated volume in 
nyselisted issues including trading at regional exchanges and on 
the overthecounter market totaled 22485 million shares 
stock prices opened slightly lower but headed further south 
shortly after the opening when the fed announced it was boosting 
the discount rate a half a percentage point to 65 percent its 
highest level in more than two years 
an increase in the discount rate which is the fee the fed 
charges for shortterm loans to member banks is the central banks 
most direct way of pushing interest rates higher to curb economic 
growth economists said jumps in other interest rates including 
those on mortgage rates and credit cards are likely to follow 
some investors regarded the news on interest rates as positive 
reasoning that with the economy growing strongly and inflation 
picking up a dash of tighter credit could keep the economy from 
overheating 
the feeling is that the sooner the medicine is administered 
the quicker the patient will recover said michael metz vice 
president and technical analyst at oppenheimer amp co 
with the dollar up sharply on the feds announcement some 
analysts said stocks and bonds could to be in line for a boost as 
foreign funds shift into dollardenominated insvestments 
but others feared that much more will be needed to keep the 
economy in line concern that the fed is going to have to tighten 
the screw another notch gave most investors the jitters said 
hugh johnson a senior vice president at first albany corp 
the market is still looking for direction and is locked in 
gridlock between higher interest rates and strong economic 
numbers johnson said adding that what results is a trendless 
trading pattern 
while analysts had expected the fed to tighten its reins on the 
money supply this week few expected the change would come in the 
discount rate which is the most dramatic move the fed can take 
most thought the fed would push up the federal funds rate the 
interest banks charge each other for overnight loans 
but analysts applauded the feds ability to crack down on 
inflation this close to a presidential election saying the move 
enhances the central banks credibility and ultimately the 
financial markets will benefit if the fed is credible johnson 
said

a young lawyer at the center of an insider 
trading ring known as the yuppie five was sentenced tuesday to 
four months in prison nearly two years after he admitted his 
guilt 
michael david pleaded guilty in november 1986 to four criminal 
counts for his part in an insider trading scheme with three other 
wall street professionals and an investor 
the five who have all pleaded guilty to various charges were 
all in their 20s at the time of the indictment and were dubbed the 
yuppie five 
the case had nothing to do with insider trading cases involving 
ivan f boesky and dennis b levine said officials 
david 30 of manhattan the last to plead guilty after his 
pretrial motions were denied by us district judge john keenan in 
late 1986 pleaded guilty to conspiracy securities fraud mail 
fraud and obstruction of a securities and exchange commission 
investigation 
you completely disrupt the forces of the free market and help 
to create incredible cynicism among the general populace keenan 
lectured david adding people think that no one is straight 
defense lawyer darrell fennell in asking for leniency noted 
that david once an associate at the the prominent new york law 
firm of paul weiss rifkind wharton and garrison faces 
disbarment and has been driving a cab to support himself 
visibly irritated keenan countered i dont think anyone 
should confuse the practice of law with a right its a 
privilege 
i regret my conduct david dressed in a dark gray suit 
told keenan before sentence was imposed and asked the judge for an 
opportunity to help rebuild my life as i have tried to do 
if i just say go and sin no more said keenan slapping 
his own wrist im making a mockery of the process 
keenan added you did betray a trust 
he sentenced david to four months in prison and four years 
probation keenan did not impose a fine but david faces civil 
penalties of between 50000 and 150000 under an sec consent 
agreement 
assistant us attorney carl h lowenson jr noted that david 
had cooperated extensively for almost two years with federal 
investigators and if there were any future trials arrising from the 
probe mr david would be an important government witness 
keenan said he would have sentenced david to more jail time if 
not for his cooperation 
david received the longest jail term of the yuppie five 
former stock broker morton shapiro was sentenced to two months in 
prison but the other three did not receive jail terms

the house voted overwhelmingly tuesday to 
sweep away most tariffs and a wide array of other barriers to the 
annual 166 billion trade in goods and services between the united 
states and canada 
we have a bill here in short in which everyone gains and no 
one loses rep william frenzel rminn said as the house 
approved 36640 and sent to the senate the freetrade agreement 
signed by president reagan and canadian prime minister brian 
mulroney last january 
the measure would authorize the president to phase out most 
tariffs between the two countries over the next 10 years and 
approves elimination of a wide range of other trade barriers under 
the pact 
many lawmakers said such a freetrade zone is needed as a 
counterbalance to european common market protectionism 
many of the europeans are talking about free trade as being 
something for europeans within that bloc i hope they dont go 
that way said sen lloyd bentsen dtexas his partys vice 
presidential candidate as his senate finance committee approved 
the measure earlier tuesday 
the senate is expected to act soon possibly later this week on 
the measure 
counterpart legislation is stalled in canada where it is 
encountering liberal party opposition 
the agreement does not set up a common market between the united 
states and canada that would mean adopting common tariffs on 
imports from third countries 
the freetrade zone would merely eliminate tariffs and some 
other barriers between the united states and canada the two 
countries would still have differing tariffs on imports from third 
countries 
the united states and israel already have established a 
freetrade zone 
advocates of the agreement claim it will spur us exports and 
create jobs while lowering consumer prices critics say agriculture 
and assorted other industries could be hurt by lowering tariffs 
tariffs currently apply to about 25 percent of trade between the 
united states and canada and the rest already is dutyfree 
ten percent of existing tariffs applying to goods ranging from 
telecommunications equipment to whiskey and rum would be 
eliminated immediately under the agreement and the rest over the 
next decade 
the agreement would ease the way for us citizens and canadians 
to invest in each others countries it would clear away barriers 
to exports of many services but would exempt transportation and 
cultural services 
it would eliminate barriers to import and export of crude oil 
petroleum products natural gas coal electricity uranium and 
other nuclear fuels 
the measure has dismayed the us uranium industry which 
stalled us approval of the bill while it pressed for a 
substantial subsidy to offset canadian imports 
the agreement would eliminate tariffs on autos and auto parts 
accounting for onethird of all trade between the countries over 
the next decade as things stand 95 percent of auto trade between 
the united states and canada already moves dutyfree 
to get dutyfree treatment autos and auto parts would have to 
be 50 percent manufactured in north america 
rep donald j pease dohio said he would support the measure 
even though he was upset over the auto provisions they improve 
the status quo but i strongly believe they fall far short of the 
advantages that benefit the canadian auto industry he said 
pease said the agreement should contain provisions that would 
bar dutyfree imports of autos and automotive products assembled in 
canada from parts manufactured in third countries 
among the bills opponents rep byron dorgan dnd said the 
agreement would leave us with canadian agricultural markets that 
are largely closed to american agricultural producers and american 
markets that are largely open to canadian agricultural producers 
and im concerned about that 
he singled out canadian rail subsidies for grain shipped through 
the huge lake port at thunder bay ontario under the centuryold 
crows nest act 
american producers receive nothing similar and thus would be 
treated unfairly dorgan said 
under the pact the canadians did agree to end rail subsidies 
for grain shipped through their western port of vancouver 
another farm lawmaker rep hal daub rneb said he was 
confident the measure would protect not only wheat but corn sugar 
and dry edible beans from a wave of canadian imports 
he said the agreement would improve the chances of success in 
the current uruguay round of negotiations to modernize the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade and thus end the subsidy shootout 
in which the only winners are the giddy greedy buyers happily 
snatching up agricultural commodities at prices below the cost of 
production

the partial merger of two detroit newspapers may not have an 
immediate impact across the industry analysts say but it could 
set the tone for the future with the market becoming more 
concentrated and the wealthiest media companies growing more 
powerful 
the deal approved this week by us attorney general edwin meese 
iii brings together gannett co inc owner of the detroit news 
and knightridder inc owner of the detroit free press in a deal 
four times larger than any joint operating agreement approved under 
the newspaper preservation act of 1970 
while the move is designed to preserve two independent editorial 
voices in a big metropolitan market some analysts and scholars 
still raise questions about the moves competitive impact 
critics charge the detroit combination is a step toward further 
concentration of the industry where the trend is toward chain 
ownership and media conglomerates and where the number of 
independently owned papers is fading 
this means that eventually there will be no city in the 
country left with competing papers and then pressure will be more 
immediate to wipe out the little competition thats left in the 
form of alternative papers community papers and suburban papers 
said bruce b brugmann publisher of the san francisco bay guardian 
william keating chief executive officer of the detroit 
newspaper agency that will oversee the merger believes joint 
operating arrangements make good economic sense in an industry 
where second place often leads to financial failure 
in the detroit case the advertising market share where a 
newspaper gets the bulk of its revenue had become so heavily 
weighted in favor of the detroit news that the free press couldnt 
survive keating said 
he said joint operating arrangements will continue to benefit 
the industry by saving newspapers too weak to survive on their own 
some newspapers will be saved by reason of a joint operating 
agreement said keating 
the danger in concentration however is that it could dilute 
competition by shifting power from the readers to media owners who 
are in the position to charge higher prices for circulation and 
advertising 
all we really know is that prices are going to go up said 
stephen lacy professor at michigan state university who has 
studied joint newspaper agreements and approves of the detroit 
arrangement 
theyll be cutting their costs and increasing their revenues 
its the same thing that happens in any monopoly situation lacy 
said 
lacy predicted that detroit newsstand prices now among the 
lowest in the nation at between 15 cents and 20 cents per copy 
could be raised to the industry average of 35 cents within the next 
few years 
alan lenhoff spokesman for the detroit free press indicated 
tuesday that prices will go up but would not say when or by how 
much 
what you have in detroit are among the lowest newspaper 
circulation prices and advertising rates in the country lenhoff 
said both have been losing approximately 30 million a year 
logic would tell you that some changes are coming but it has not 
been announced to what extent 
lenhoff said an announcement may be forthcoming before the 
merger takes effect on aug 19 
in 1920 700 cities had competing dailies today there are 22 
eighty percent of daily circulation is controlled by chains and 
chains have begun to merge with each other 
gannett who has absorbed other chains in recent years is not a 
newcomer to joint newspaper agreements the company is now an owner 
in eight of the 20 joint contracts and knightridder is an owner in 
three 
under the partial merger approved monday the detroit 
newspapers among the 10 largest in the country will merge 
production advertising and circulation departments for 100 years 
while maintaining separate editorial and news departments 
although such a merger is illegal for other businesses under 
antitrust law the 1970 newspaper preservation act granted 
newspapers selective exemption from the law if one of the 
newspapers is failing financially the legislative intent was to 
preserve an editorial voice where one otherwise might be lost 
some analysts say the detroit case could set a precedent for 
other large metropolitan newspapers but others say there are few 
cities with competing papers ripe for such a merger 
of the 22 cities with separately owned competing dailies only 
a handful are potential candidates for joint agreements including 
denver dallas chicago and boston 
there are so few markets where people would even want to get 
together and talk about it lacy said
