and cambodias secondlargest city 
khmer rouge guerrillas claimed they attacked the cambodian 
capital with grenades saturday night forcing the premier and 
president to flee toward vietnam but the claim could not be 
confirmed and previous communist khmer rouge claims have been 
exaggerated

held battambang cambodias second city for four hours last 
weekend and still controlled a position that had defended route 5 
the major highway leading from the city across country to phnom

paris on jan 1516 for the five permanent members of the un 
security council to discuss cambodia and the australian plan could 
be on the agenda 
the meeting will permit an examination of all the proposals 
advanced in recent weeks concerning cambodia and a study of all 
means that might bring an end to armed conflicts on the ground 
the ministry said it comes at a time when it appears possible to 
envisage an increased role for the united nations in the settlement 
process 
the austalian plan would require backing from all five permanent 
members of the security council the united states soviet union 
china britain and france 
indonesias foreign minister ali alatas arrived in thailand on 
tuesday in hopes of meeting representatives of cambodias 
vietnameseinstalled government and the three guerrilla groups to 
hear their views on the australian plan and on efforts indonesia

the conflict has raged since vietnamese troops in late 1978 
ended the brutal 3year reign of pol pots khmer rouge which 
killed hundreds of thousands of cambodians while trying to create a 
primitive agrarian society 
fears of a battlefield victory by the khmer rouge the strongest 
of three guerrilla groups have risen since september when vietnam 
said it withdrew all troops 
a thai military intelligence officer speaking on condition of 
anonymity said tuesday the khmer rouge are clearly moving 
deeper and deeper they want to sabotage the credibility of the 
government 
the khmer rouge said earlier they had attacked and set ablaze 
battambang on friday and saturday a western diplomat in thailand 
said the battambang attack was more psychological than 
strategic 
the reported attack in phnom penh if confirmed would be the 
most serious in the civil war 
the khmer rouge broadcast said resistance forces lobbed five 
grenades saturday into the center of phnom penh near the office of 
the central committee of the communist party killing or wounding 
some vietnamese and lackey puppets

said she had no information about the reported guerrilla offensive 
in reply to a question she again defended us policy as 
supporting a role for the khmer rouge in any transitional 
government but added we abhor the khmer rouge the khmer rouge 
we have said are absolutely horrible 
the guerrillas said their attacks prevented premier hun sen from 
meeting in phnom penh with australian deputy foreign secretary 
michael costello for talks on a peace plan it said hun sen went 
from ho chi minh city to cambodias eastern svay rieng province 
bordering vietnam to meet the envoy 
costello said after arriving in bangkok on tuesday that as far 
as he knew the venue was changed from phnom penh to svay rieng on 
saturday and that he first heard of the change sunday he could not 
confirm the grenade attack 
spk said hun sen invited costello to meet him in svay rieng 
because the premier was already there on an inspection tour 
it said hun sen told costello he agreed to a un role in an 
interim administration only if the un seat held by the guerrillas 
first is vacated

an amphibian importer has spawned a controversy 
by entering giant frogs in the annual frog jump jubilee making 
some people hopping mad because the jumbo jumpers can stretch 3 
feet and weigh up to 15 pounds 
organizers say andy j koffman 40 has created a superfrog 
crisis with his bid to enter 10 oversized amphibians from africa 
in the whimsical competition started by mark twains story the 
celebrated jumping frog of calaveras county 
imagine basketball players 40 or 50 feet tall thats about the 
human equivalent of the frogs koffman wants to enter in the contest 
to be held in may in angels camp calif 
ill apply for a green card for these guys if i have to 
koffman said sunday this is what america is all about 
koffman a licensed importer of exotic birds reptiles and 
amphibians from africa for nearly 13 years says he is the sole 
successful importer of the goliath frog a denizen of swiftflowing 
rivers in cameroon and equatorial guinea 
he said he had imported 50 of the frogs which can measure 3 
feet in length he sold 30 of them to the cincinnati zoo the 
lincoln park zoo in chicago the brookfield zoo in chicago a 
japanese importer for zoos there a zoo in the netherlands and a 
wholesaler in florida 
the other 20 ranging from 3 pounds to 8 pounds occupy a pond 
in his basement he says he is preparing to import some 15 pounders 
until now virtually all the entrants have been california 
bullfrogs with the biggest about a pound said diane baumann 
interim manager for the 39th agricultural district association 
which has run the event since it was started in 1928 at the 
calaveras county fair 
we have had some imports from africa but they were always 
about the same size she said in a telephone interview sunday 
night 
the ninemember association board of directors is meeting friday 
to discuss the issue probably in executive closed session due 
to the possibility of litigation she said 
concerns include fairness safety and survival of the 
competition baumann said 
its like racing a draft horse against thoroughbreds entirely 
different species baumann said 
the contest record of 21 feet 5 inches for three hops was set 
by rosie the ribiter in 1986 koffman says his superfrogs can 
easily exceed that in a single bound 
baumann also said some feared one of the goliaths might leap out 
of the arena unfortunately our stage is only about 35 feet 
deep and hit a spectator 
moreover unlike their much smaller relatives the monster frogs 
have sharp teeth and might gobble up their competitors she said 
koffman says he feeds his 20 frogs about 100 goldfish a week 
varying their diet with occasional mice and crickets 
they do have a voracious appetite he said theyll eat 
anything that moves 
he said he once dissected a frog in africa and found what looked 
like an entire colony of army ants in the stomach 
what this guy did was he found one of these columns of ants 
and got in front and opened his mouth and let the whole colony walk 
in koffman said theyll eat birds baby chicks 
he keeps the frogs in a 1500gallon pond about 12 feet square 
with logs and plants around the perimeter and an island in the 
center air and water are kept at a constant 80 degrees fahrenheit 
the walls of the room are padded and lined with plastic and the 
water is kept slightly alkaline 
koffman said he grew up as a doctors son in east tawas mich 
went from home aquariums to owning four pet stores by age 18 
earned a degree in business administration at the university of 
michigan and became an importer of exotic creatures

david duke hitched his white supremacy line 
to the louisiana republican party in 1989 and shocked loyal 
regulars with a state house victory now he wants a ride to 
capitol hill on the grand old party 
four louisiana republicans are battling for the state 
endorsement saturday in the race against us sen bennett 
johnston threeterm democratic darling of the powerful oil and gas 
lobby 
duke should not expect the partys backing at the new orleans 
convention said william nungesser chairman of the louisiana gop 
in december caucuses the former grand wizard of the ku klux klan 
pulled in only a few nonbinding delegate pledges 
caucuses are a partyinsider type of situation the votes that 
really count are the votes that come on election day duke said 
but he said hell run as a republican with or without a gop 
blessing 
that move could bring down the wrath of the louisiana party 
which at times has appeared almost ambivalent about duke nungesser 
said 
david dukes past is horrible no reasonable person should be 
ready to forgive him based on his own statements any reasonable 
rational person should not believe hes changed just because he 
says he has nungesser said 
he predicted that a previously failed attempt to censure duke 
would be revived if he runs against johnston without party backing 
it will prove once again hes got his own agenda nungesser 
said 
the oct 6 election is an open primary a candidate freeforall 
without regard to party if no one wins a majority the top two 
votegetters enter a runoff 
duke 39 has been a thorn in the gop side since the polished 
handsome advocate of caucasian purity switched his registration 
from democrat to republican 
a few weeks later he claimed a 227vote victory for a seat in 
the louisiana legislature by defeating john treen brother of 
louisianas first republican governor since reconstruction david 
treen 
duke left the klan in 1980 accused of trying to sell a 
membership list to a rival faction and now leads his own group 
the national association for the advancement of white people since 
campaigning for the state house dukes racist antisemitic points 
of view have been cloaked in euphemism critics charge 
duke in turn says he champions equal rights for everyone 
including whites welfare reform elimination of minority 
setasides and birth control programs for teenagers are his 
platform 
dukes election spurred republican national committee chairman 
lee atwater to denounce him as a charlatan duke ignored the 
declaration saying the republicans hadnt helped him anyway 
even presidents bush and reagan endorsed opponent john treen 
last year duke said he doesnt expect the state partys support 
this ear 
no matter who they endorse i am planning on running i hope 
other candidates will run duke said 
he said he has the best chance to dislodge johnston 
i think his support is extremely soft i think hes very very 
vulnerable duke said 
i think my candidacy would assure his defeat i would appeal 
to his traditional voters a majority of the white bluecollar 
vote along with some conservative republicans duke said 
johnston counters that the republican party is under siege 
theres almost a battle going on for the soul of the 
republican party there are those like david treen who say that 
duke should be censured and in effect declared an illegitimate 
republican and there are others who more or less welcomed him into 
the party johnston said 
beth rickey a new orleans member of the gop state central 
committee is not confident her party will take a bold stand 
against duke the committee rejected her earlier censure attempt 
saying it had inadequate procedural grounds 
theres a lot of embarrassment the perception is that they 
are weak and wimpy and have not done anything ms rickey said 
dukes effect on the legislature was limited none of his bills 
passed but public sentiment was favorable when a move to block his 
seating fizzled lawmakers who live as many as 300 miles away from 
dukes nearly allwhite district in suburban new orleans said they 
got calls pressing them to let duke take the oath of office 
duke had finally achieved a degree of mainstream credibility it 
was something that eluded him since the 1970s when he was known as 
the nazi of louisiana state university 
duke joined the kkk in high school and is largely credited with 
shifting the organizations focus from nightriding lynchmen to an 
unmasked family group kneedeep in white culture and wrapped in 
the american flag 
duke says he earns his living as an author and has acknowledged 
writing under a pseudonymn a sex manual called finders keepers 
and a streetfighting manual for blacks called african atto

a fourmonth hunger strike by the leader of an 
iraniandirected team that failed in a 1980 bid to assassinate an 
exile leader in paris is raising concern about possible terrorist 
attacks in france 
anis naccache supported by irans president and foreign 
minister says france promised to free him in the deal that won the 
release in may 1988 of all french hostages that were held by 
proiranian groups in lebanon 
serving a life sentence naccache could only get out of prison 
if pardoned by president francois mitterrand who has said he might 
do so but has not made clear when or under what circumstances 
naccache a lebanese moslem has lost 59 pounds since he started 
his fast on sept 8 and weighs only 105 pounds said his lawyer 
jacques verges 
naccache is refusing food but is drinking liquids and is fed 
intravenously from time to time by doctors at the fresne prison 
outside paris 
naccache has lost his immune defenses to disease verges said 
if tomorrow someone goes into his cell and sneezes in his 
nose he could very well die from it verges said on french 
television 
it is widely believed that if naccache dies in prison his 
friends will strike back 
the death of anis naccache if it comes brutally at the end of 
his hunger strike will by all evidence be serious for france 
which would find itself confronted by an increased terrorist menace 
easy to predict the conservative newspaper le figaro wrote 
saturday 
the hunger strike seems to have hardened mitterrands stand 
he cannot hope to free himself with a hunger strike the 
president said friday if anis naccache decides to die in prison 
and we do not have the means to stop him this will be his 
responsibility 
a year ago mitterrand called on iran to provide proof that 
naccaches freedom really had been promised in the hostage deal 
negotiated by the conservative government of premier jacques chirac 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani and foreign minister ali 
akbar velayati have said it was promised but apparently have not 
given mitterrand any evidence 
chirac denied naccaches release was part of the agreement and 
mitterrand said i have no reason to doubt the word of mr 
chirac 
during the uncomfortable twoyear period of cohabitation in 
french government the conservative premier and socialist president 
were not sharing many secrets the hostage deal came at the peak of 
the hotly contested 1988 election campaign in which mitterrand won 
reelection by defeating chirac and the socialists regained 
control of the government 
but the former premier suggested that mitterrand should consider 
including naccache in the annual bastille day pardon on july 14 
1989 because we are in a period of tension and should not add to 
the reasons that might make us targets of terrorism 
naccache was one of three prisoners whose freedom was demanded 
by a group calling itself the committee for solidarity with arab 
and middle east political prisoners which claimed responsibility 
for bombings in 1985 and 1986 that killed 13 people and injured 
more than 250 in paris 
investigators say they believe the committee was a front for 
hezbollah a proiranian shiite extremist organization in lebanon 
that denies involvement in terrorism and hostagetaking 
in an accident of the court calendar that is sure to increase 
the pressure 10 people charged in the 198586 bombings will come 
to trial jan 29 
the alleged leader of the group fouad ali saleh of tunisia 
gave a hint of what is to come at a pretrial hearing friday 
shouting in court hezbollah will massacre you and the west 
will die at the hand of islam prepare your caskets 
when prosecutor jacques fourvel tried to interrupt saleh yelled 
out shut up you jews and christians have no right to talk when 
a moslem is speaking islam will be your death god will crush you 
murderer son of a pig executioner you eat like a pig you have 
ripped up the koran 
naccaches hunger strike and the upcoming trial were cited as 
possible reasons last month when france put stiff antiterrorist 
security checks into effect especially at airports and border 
crossings 
fears were spurred by the seizure of 485 pounds of explosives in 
valencia spain apparently en route for france spanish police 
said at least three men arrested with the explosives were hezbollah 
members 
naccache and four other men were convicted in the july 1980 
attack on shahpour bakhtiar irans prime minister before the 1979 
islamic revolution bakhtiar escaped injury and still lives in 
paris but a policeman and a bystander were killed 
both defense and prosecution said at the trial that naccache and 
his team were acting on orders from senior iranian officials

the ceausescus looted public museums 
of thousands of valuable artworks during their authoritarian rule 
and turned the countrys culture ministry into a corpse says 
the new head of the department 
it was a simple matter of greed culture minister andrei 
plesu said in an interview monday dictator nicolae ceausescu had 
to possess these works he added 
plesu a respected art historian and philosopher had been 
banished to the provinces under the rule of ceausescu and his wife 
elena the ceausescus were ousted last month found guilty of 
grave crimes and executed dec 25 
the official appointed by the provisional government spoke in 
a chilly and gloomy conference hall of his department known under 
ceausescu as the council of culture and socialist education 
plesu said ministry employees had just begun work on an 
inventory of paintings sculptures and other art objects reclaimed 
from dozens of houses and vacation homes used by the ceausescus and 
their relatives 
he stole from our patrimony objects of art and used them in 
his own house said plesu 40 estimating that thousands of 
valuable works by romanian and foreign artists were claimed by the 
ceausescus 
there were houses full of such objects plesu said he said 
he believed flemish masters were among the artists whose paintings 
were taken illegally 
ceausescus hunger for art appeared to be common knowledge in 
romania 
bogdan lazaroae a 21yearold student said the art museum in 
his home city of sibiu 150 miles northwest of bucharest had been 
forced to contribute a rembrandt to the ceausescu collection 
plesu forced last year to move from bucharest to a bacau 
district town near the border to soviet moldavia after signing a 
letter critical of the state writers union said the dictator had 
no sense of art 
plesu described the organization preceding his ministry as an 
institution organized against culture that suppressed most 
artistic expression not complimentary to the ceausescus 
i have to revive a corpse he said of his ministry 
much of the culture budget of past years was spent on cintarea 
romaniei a nearly continuous fest of music literature and dance 
designed to pay homage to the ceausescus and their narrow vision of 
what constitued art 
the festival has been discontinued and plesu announced saturday 
that the ministry would more than double last years budget of 55 
million to 135 million to infuse new life in cultural activities 
forced underground under the ceausescu leadership 
plesu said monday there had been no wholesale purge of his 
ministry but main culprits of past excesses had been retired while 
the more than 30member censors section had been dissolved 
plesu said the cuts had reduced the staff of 180 to about 140 
and he planned to prune it to 90 
those remaining need time to adapt to the gentler postceausescu 
era he said 
i needed three days to teach my secretary normal behavior 
he said she was sullen she was running around like mad if i 
said one word as if it had been a command

a cult leader facing murder charges in the 
slayings of an ohio family hid out in southern california for a 
month carrying an assortment of guns and storing ammunition and 
paramilitary gear authorities said monday 
jeffrey lundgren 39 a defrocked lay minister of the 
reorganized church of jesus christ of latter day saints in ohio 
his wife alice 38 and their son damon 19 were expected to be 
arraigned tuesday in municipal court on fugitive charges said san 
diego county deputy district attorney john hewicker 
extradition proceedings were expected to follow later they 
already have said in their first meeting with investigators that 
they would fight extradition hewicker said 
the lundgrens were arrested sunday outside a motel in national 
city about five miles south of san diego by us bureau of alcohol 
tobacco and firearms agents and police 
a cache of weapons ammunition and paramilitary equipment 
including gas masks were found in a motel room and a storage locker 
in nearby chula vista 
three other lundgren children kristen 10 caleb 9 and 
jason 15 were taken into protective custody atf spokeswoman 
april freud said monday declining to elaborate on their 
whereabouts 
atf agents continued the hunt in southern california for the 
last two of the 13 suspects in the killings of dennis avery his 
wife cheryl and their three young daughters law enforcement 
officers looked for kathryn renee johnson 36 and daniel david 
craft 25 who probably were with lundgren last week freud said 
they were believed to have left san diego saturday and they 
are in the southern california area she said 
in cleveland meanwhile the plain dealer reported that avery 
had purchased three weapons for lundgren three days before his 
death 
charles e wallace assistant special agent in charge for ohio 
for the us bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms said one of 
the weapons purchased by avery a 45caliber pistol may have been 
the murder weapon 
avery visited a chagrin falls ohio gun store last april 15 and 
picked out a rifle and two pistols wallace told the plain dealer 
in a story published in tuesdays editions 
the following day avery returned to the store with lufdyren 
who signed federal weapons purchase transaction forms wallace 
said avery charged the 1300 cost to his credit card wallace 
said 
wallace said ballistics tests must be conducted to determine 
whether one of the pistols was the murder weapon autopsies showed 
each of the victims was shot several times with a 45caliber 
weapon 
one of the weapons seized near san diego matched a description 
of one of the pistols purchased by avery the day before he died 
wallace said 
freud said lundgren had been in the san diego area for at least 
a month before his arrest but didnt know where hed been staying 
or if his family had been with him then 
mrs lundgren checked into the motel wednesday night with the 
three children saying shed been arguing with her husband 
searches of the motel room and the locker uncovered numerous 
weapons including two assault rifles 1000 rounds of ammunition 
an assortment of knives several gas masks and gas containers 40 
pounds of powder for reloading ammunition and other types of 
paramilitary equipment and camping gear freud said 
he seems to have packaged up all his weapons and ammunition 
and taken them with him along with his personal effects she 
said it appeared that he kept four firearms with him and kept 
the other firearms and various types of paramilitary equipment 
stashed somewhere else 
we now will be trying to trace the weapons trying to 
determine who purchased them and the most recent documentation of 
who the owners might have been freud said 
she said authorities were still trying to determine why lundgren 
was in san diego since his only tie to the city was navy service 
there 15 years ago 
lundgren broke away from the reorganized church and persuaded 
other members to follow him the group once lived on a 15acre farm 
near kirtland ohio where bodies believed to be those of the 
averys were unearthed last week 
investigators believe the averys were killed in april and buried 
in a common barn under the barn near the clevelandarea town the 
day before lundgren and his followers fled to a farm near holden 
mo 
lundgren and 12 followers were indicted in the killings 
authorities were led to the national city motel by telephone 
calls made from a pay phone to another location under surveillance 
said steven c latourette a prosecutor in lake county ohio 
latourette has said that the averys apparently were killed in a 
sacrificial ritual that would allow the cult to relocate to the 
wilderness 
but dale luffman president of the northeast ohio chapter of the 
reorganized church said the slayings may have resulted from 
disputes over money sex or fear the averys would leave the cult 
lundgren was stripped of his credentials as a lay minister with 
the church in 1987 after he began preaching radical doctrines he 
and others who followed him left the church and eventually settled 
on the farm near kirtland 
the reorganized church of jesus christ of latter day saints 
based in independence mo has roots and some beliefs in common 
with the salt lake citybased mormon church but is separate

a flurry of violent incidents involving 
moslem militants including an apparent attempt to assassinate a 
cabinet member is reminding officials that religious extremism 
remains a powerful force in egyptian politics 
most worrisome was the dec 16 explosion of a truck bomb minutes 
before interior minister zaki badrs motorcade passed while the 
bomb was crudely done apparently the work of an amateur it marked 
the first time such a weapon was used in egypt 
why this new method asked newspaper editor ibrahim nafei a 
confidant of president hosni mubarak does this mean the plot was 
hatched abroad and executed here in this primitive way 
even mubarak normally a paragon of measured calm professed 
concern that the attack bore evidence of the kind of fanatical 
conspiracy that killed his predecessor anwar sadat eight years 
ago 
it was not an individual operation the president said 
egypt has cause for concern 
experts estimate there are 150000 islamic activists in egypt 
gathered under the umbrella label of the islamic group at least 10 
percent are thought to consider violence acceptable to attain their 
fundamentalist goals 
generally they and hundreds of thousands more in the older 
more moderate but still outlawed moslem brotherhood demand 
implementation of sharia islams 1350yearold legal and ethical 
code 
the government claims 90 percent of the law already encompasses 
sharia and that its working to change the rest 
the brotherhood was born in egypt in 1928 and has spread through 
the arab world it turned to violence in the late 1940s in egypt 
assassinating a prime minister and was punished brutally for it 
each of the next two decades saw spurts of religiously based 
violence and government suppression 
bloodied by vicious reprisals under president gamal abdel 
nasser the brotherhood disavowed violence in the 1960s but sadat 
nassers successor began a crackdown shortly before his death and 
the repression has continued though the brotherhood itself largely 
has been left alone 
what is causing concern among many watchers of the 
fundamentalist scene is the introduction of the boobytrapped truck 
a researcher who follows religious activism for a western 
embassy said he did not think it was the work of jihad or holy 
war which masterminded the october 1981 assassination of sadat and 
was implicated in a failed coup attempt that followed 
i dont think it was jihad because jihad would have done it 
right they have some military experience but this could incite 
others to follow suit and it means theres an escalation in the 
confrontation said the official who refused to be identified by 
name or nationality 
militant violence in egypt normally finds expression in random 
street disturbances as it did in the coup attempt that followed 
sadats murder 
several such outbreaks have occurred since early december in the 
southern town of assiut leading to clashes with police that have 
injured dozens and have led to hundreds of arrests 
in the week before the apparent attack on badr nearly 500 
people were rounded up in assiut after a fight between police and 
militants carrying chains knives and firearms ten police officers 
and 30 militants were wounded many by gunfire in the fight that 
began after police besieged a mosque where the activists had sought 
refuge 
the same type of disturbance occurred jan 2 when security 
police at assiut dispersed with tear gas 130 worshipers who tried 
to march from a fundamentalist mosque to protest downtown 
those reactions to moslem militancy are typical of security 
forces since badr a career police officer took charge of domestic 
security in 1986 a moslem he ranks among the countrys staunchest 
campaigners against islamic militants he often uses emergency laws 
to detain and rearrest suspects 
the western researcher said most moslem militant leaders are in 
prison 
but the bitterness is spreading he said some people have 
been detained 10 times in the past year 
some experts estimate that during certain periods last year 
jails held as many as 6000 militant fundamentalists at a time 
that the apparent attempt on badrs life closely followed the 
assiut conflicts aroused skepticism among some people even 
nonfundamentalists 
its obviously a government ploy said ahmed fouad an 
apolitical moslem agricultural engineer the limited extent of 
damage to the car and the fact no one was hurt shows it couldnt 
have been real it obviously was done to give badr justification 
for more arrests 
police arrested a man fleeing the pickup truck as the rear part 
of it blew up the relatively small explosion reportedly was caused 
by gunpower electrically detonated by batteries connected to a key 
near the ignition 
egypts attorney general banned news stories about the 
investigation but reports published before the blackout named the 
suspect as gamal mohammed mustafa 26 a medical student at assiut 
university who hails from fayoum 
like assiut fayoum is a southern egypt town known for moslem 
fundamentalist agitation 
security sources said 17 other students mostly mustafas 
friends who live in assiut but who hail from the fayoum area were 
arrested after the assassination attempt the sources said mustafa 
had been arrested previously in connection with an attack on a 
mixedsex party at assiut university in 1988

khmer rouge guerrillas said tuesday 
they attacked cambodias capital with grenades and plastic 
explosives killing soldiers and policemen and sending the 
president and premier fleeing to vietnam 
the reported attack saturday could not be verified and some 
previous khmer rouge claims have proved exaggerated if true the 
siege would be the most serious in phnom penh which has been 
largely spared in the 11yearold war between the guerrillas and 
the vietnameseinstalled government 
the governments spk news agency in a report tuesday monitored 
in bangkok did not mention any attack saying sundays national 
day celebrations took place in total security saturday and 
monday also were peaceful it said 
the guerrillas earlier said they attacked and set ablaze the 
secondlargest city battambang on friday and saturday a western 
diplomat in thailand confirmed tuesday that the town was attacked 
but said the effect was more psychological than strategic 
the khmer rouge army radio said resistance forces lobbed five 
grenades into the city center near the office of the central 
committee of the communist party killing or wounding some 
vietnamese and lackey puppets 
vietnamese and puppet leaders fled in panic to save their own 
skins said the broadcast monitored in bangkok 
it said the attack took place at 0200 on the night of january 
6 phnom penh authorities on sunday celebrated national day the 
11th anniversary of the overthrow of khmer rouge rule 
vietnam invaded phnom pehn on dec 25 1978 and drove out the 
khmer rouge government on jan 7 1979 
another khmer rouge army broadcast said the guerrillas aided by 
citizens and government officials attacked the city center and 
suburbs saturday with 32 grenades and tnt plastic explosives 
killing or wounding some vietnamese soldiers and puppets who were 
drinking near a hotel 
a number of vietnamese secret agents and puppet policemen 
called a3 were also killed by blasts from the grenades and plastic 
explosives in the suburbs it said 
it said vietnam immediately sent premier hun sen and 
president heng samrin as well as some other leaders to ho chi 
minh city 
ho chi minh vietnams major southern city is about 34 miles 
east of cambodias border province of svay rieng 
the broadcast said hun sen was sent from ho chi minh city to 
svay rieng for his scheduled talks with australias deputy foreign 
secretary michael costello 
the vietnamese dared not allow hun sen to see costello in 
phnom penh because of security reasons it said 
the official government news agency spk said monday that 
costello held talks with hun sen in svay rieng sunday and monday 
it is rare for such talks to be held outside the capital 
costellos visit was part of a tour to promote australias 
proposal for the united nations to govern cambodia before a general 
election 
in paris diplomatic sources said monday that representatives 
of the un security councils five permanent members will meet 
there jan 1516 to consider ways to bring peace to cambodia 
the khmer rouge broadcast said phnom penh authorities imposed 
tougher martial law measures after a number of grenade attacks 
it said they feared that guerrillas operating in phnom penh would 
step up activities in coordination with forces outside the city 
the communist khmer rouge has about 30000 fighters and is the 
largest of three guerrilla groups in a resistance coalition the 
khmer rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people when it ruled 
cambodia from 1975 until vietnam invaded in late 1978 and replaced 
it with the heng samrin government 
fears of a possible return to power of the khmer rouge have 
increased as they have made major battlefield advances since 
vietnam in september made what it called the withdrawal of its last 
troops from cambodia 
the khmer rouge radio said the guerrillas would keep fighting 
and attacking the capital until an international authority verified 
vietnam withdrawal and a coalition government including the heng 
samrin government and the three guerrilla groups is formed 
the khmr rouge seized the gemmining town of pailin in western 
battahbng province bordering thailand on oct 22 
they claimed they hit battambang town starting at midnight 
friday attacking the 5th military regions command there and in 
banteay meanchey and western pursat province an airfield was among 
the targets reported hit in battambang 
fighting still raged at dawn saturday said a guerrilla radio 
broadcast sunday 
in an interview broadcast over state radio sunday cambodias 
defense minister gen tea banh admitted that guerrillas are 
advancing in areas near the thai border and said his forces are 
abandoning some places to concentrate defenses in major towns and 
roads 
the enemies have been gradually advancing in their attacks 
against a number of our positions along the border to be sincere 
we have lost some positions he said 
we cannot stay in every village tea banh said we have to 
abandon some and keep some strategic ones 
he did not mention fighting in phnom penh or in battambang town

thirty of the 50 states are improving their 
infant mortality rates enough to meet a federal goal of reducing 
nationwide deaths this year to nine per 1000 live births 
according to a study by the childrens defense fund 
the washingtonbased organization which lobbies on childrens 
issues also said only five states have made sufficient progress to 
meet the goal of the us surgeon general of reducing the 
proportion of low birthweight babies to 5 percent 
babies born with low birthweight are 20 times more likely than 
other infants to die in infancy and face greater risk of lifelong 
disabilities the report said 
the report said 10 babies died for every 1000 live births in 
the united states in 1988 that placed the united states 19th among 
nations behind singapore hong kong spain and ireland it said 
the fund ranked the 50 states and the district of columbia on 
their improvement in 10 areas of caring for children and the 
adequacy of the states investments in programs benefiting children 
six received grades of 50 percent or more vermont 65 maine 
60 massachusetts and minnesota 55 and connecticut and delaware 50 
new mexico received the lowest grade credited with 10 points of 
a possible 100 
other scores included california and south carolina 45 percent 
illinois new hampshire new jersey new york pennsylvania rhode 
island washington and wisconsin 40 percent alabama alaska iowa 
michigan north dakota and virginia 35 percent 
others were arkansas florida hawaii maryland nevada ohio 
tennessee and west virginia 30 percent the district of columbia 
indiana kentucky louisiana montana nebraska north carolina 
oklahoma oregon texas utah and wyoming 25 percent 
arizona georgia mississippi and missouri received 20 percent 
and colorado idaho kansas and south dakota 15 percent 
the ratings measured progress in prenatal care reducing the 
proportion of infants born with low birthweights child poverty 
births to unmarried women teen birth rates establishment of 
paternity child poverty housing affordability high school 
graduation and youth employment 
only alabama new hampshire and vermont demonstrated adequate 
progress on six of the 10 measures the fund said arizona and 
maryland each showed no progress deterioration or inadequate 
progress in nine of the 10 areas it said 
the report credited new mexico with the largest percentage 
reduction in infant mortality between 1978 and 1988 a drop of 426 
percent from 141 to 81 per 1000 live births 
rhode island was second with a 382 percent reduction from 136 
to 84 
states not making enough progress to meet the goal set by the 
surgeon general were alabama alaska colorado delaware the 
district of columbia florida georgia idaho illinois indiana 
louisiana maryland michigan mississippi montana new york 
north carolina oregon pennsylvania south carolina and tennessee 
the five states keeping up with the goal for reducing low 
birthweight were alaska minnesota new hampshire north carolina 
and utah 
the study also rated the adequacy of state spending on medicaid 
coverage for pregnant women and babies medicaid coverage for 
children nutrition supplements early education supplements child 
care quality child support enforcement improvement in benefits 
under the aid to families with dependent children program adequacy 
of such benefits compared with housing costs improving 
studentteacher ratios and youth employment initiatives 
it said five states iowa maine massachusetts minnesota and 
vermont made sufficient investments in seven of those 10 areas 
it said idaho new mexico and south dakota had not invested 
sufficiently in any 
the report called on president bush to take several steps to 
improve the lot of children in the united states 
it said the president should support child care legislation 
extend medicaid coverage to pregnant women and families below 200 
percent of the federal poverty level expand food supplements for 
all eligible pregnant women infants and children by 1994 immunize 
all children against preventable childhood diseases and reauthorize 
head start with enough to serve all eligible children with quality

the fall of manuel antonio noriega will have 
little impact on drug trafficking and money laundering say experts 
who contend drug lords changed operations three years ago when the 
united states reversed its support of the panamanian dictator 
in terms of any impact on the flow of drugs or money through 
the banking system the impact of noriegas arrest will be nil 
said rensselaer lee iii a consultant and lecturer who specializes 
in latin american drug trafficking issues 
im talking about the total flow of drugs the total flow of 
money 
scott b macdonald an international economist who has written 
two books on the drug trade refers to the trafficking as the 
mythical hydra a manyheaded monster reptile cut off one 
head and another head grows in another place 
drug traffickers have looked elsewhere since panamas usefulness 
as a moneylaundering center was dimmed in 1987 and the central 
american nation was never a major transit point for drugs anyway 
the experts say 
they pretty much gutted the banking system in terms of total 
asset size macdonald said referring to the impact of the us 
campaign against noriegas regime the assets drained out of the 
country legitimate business wanted to get out of panama and the 
people who stayed in panama doing business came under greater 
scrutiny 
with noriega gone what little moneylaundering activity is left 
can be expected to move to the places others went before he said 
citing anguilla in the caribbean montserrat a british crown 
caribbean colony and paraguay and uruguay as new moneylaundering 
centers 
the routes for shipping drugs also have changed he said 
drugs now go through bolivia argentina paraguay uruguay and 
europe he said some of it still goes to north america but 
europe is increasingly considered an open market the perception is 
that north america is becoming a saturated market drug 
traffickers who also move their product through brazil and 
guatemala are looking forward to changes in the european community 
in 1992 when the borders will open making their work easier on 
that continent he said 
but this was all happening before the jan 3 arrest of noriega 
touted by the bush administration as a blow against drug 
trafficking 
the downfall of noriega who was indicted by federal grand 
juries in february 1988 inconveniences the colombians no doubt 
some but nothing thats going to make any noticeable difference to 
americas drug problems said peter reuter of the rand corp 
no one ever said that panama was the exclusive or even the 
dominant laundry reuter said laundries are available in a lot 
of places 
the drug enforcement administration is pleased panama may become 
an ally rather than an enemy in the drug war but doesnt expect 
the drug trade to collapse or even show signs of distress because 
of noriegas arrest 
no single event no matter how significant it is will result 
in the immediate impact on availability of drugs in the united 
states said frank shults of the dea at this point we are not 
in a position to speculate on the longterm possibilities 
there are numerous financial centers throughout the world 
shults said drug traffickers are very flexible in their ability 
to move their money they will no doubt exploit whatever markets 
they are able to 
panama was a transit point for the drugs themselves but not 
by any means a substantial amount he said 
however he said this was a major sanctuary for the 
traffickers to use and a haven for money laundering they are out 
looking for other markets 
macdonald said noriegas ouster and arrest has had one important 
impact 
with noriega gone the one man in panama who would very much 
allow the narco trafficantes safe haven is gone i think that is 
crucial it means that the medellin cocaine cartel people cannot 
suddenly disappear into panama and not have to worry about it

panama may be looking for far more money to 
rebuild its crippled economy than the united states can afford 
according to lawmakers who visited the central american country 
panamanian vice president ricardo arias calderon suggested an 
initial oneyear aid contribution of 15 billion to help repair 
damage caused by the dec 20 american invasion a house member said 
monday 
obviously we can and should help ease the immediate suffering 
caused by the invasion said rep gerry studds dmass who 
called destruction in poor neighborhoods of panama city 
terrible 
we should provide medical supplies shelter food and other 
basic human needs studds said but beyond that our abilities 
are limited and we should say so 
arias calderons 15 billion estimate would be 10 percent of 
the total us budget for aiding dozens of nations and its 
unlikely the united states can come up with such an amount in 
direct cash assistance 
several democratic lawmakers who took a twoday trip to panama 
last week said they are not inclined to cut domestic programs to 
send aid and sought to pressure president bush to justify the new 
spending and find the money 
in the days ahead the president whose invasion this was 
will have a responsibility to explain to the american people how 
much aid is necessary what it will accomplish and how it will be 
paid for studds said in a statement 
these are important questions because i for one am not about 
to take money away from american schools or housing or medical 
research to send to panama 
rep lee hamilton dind said it was more likely that us aid 
will be in the hundreds of millions of dollars spread over several 
years and that some aid will come in the form debt forgiveness and 
loan guarantees rather than cash aid 
some aid may also have to come from other countries he said 
a 30member house delegation met with panamanian government and 
business leaders thursday and friday to assess how much aid is 
needed to restore what had been one of the regions healthiest 
economies crippled by economic sanctions in the effort to force 
dictator manuel antonio noriega from power 
the invasion and the current occupation by american troops 
have turned a panamanian problem the burden of having a corrupt 
and cruel ruler into an american problem said rep don edwards 
dcalif a member of the visiting group 
no formal aid proposal has been made and deputy treasury 
secretary john e robson insisted monday that no dollar amounts 
were discussed when a highlevel executive branch delegation met 
with the same leaders last week in panama city 
but edwards said arias calderon suggested the 15 billion 
figure as a first installment in a longterm rebuilding package 
he acknowledged that panamanians support the us action but 
added it is entirely possible that some of this good will 
will dissipate when the panamanians find out that uncle sam will 
not provide all the billions it will take to repair the damage 
rebuild the hundreds of destroyed houses and bring the economy to a 
high level 
robson said a joint treasurystate department task force was 
working on proposals for aiding panama but declined to discuss 
specific steps that might be taken he said panamanians realize 
their first priority must be to restore investor confidence 
he hinted that the administration will rely heavily on 
privatesector efforts to rebuild the panamanian economy 
suggesting us aid would be used to leverage private investment 
the underpinning of the panamanian economic recovery plan 
rests on the private sector robson said at a news conference he 
added the united states may look in part to other governments 
that have an interest in panama for direct aid

simplicity can be spectacular and a long opera 
can seem short when its mozarts wonderful cosi fan tutte 
performed as radiantly as it was at its first metropolitan operas 
presentation of this season 
cosi on monday night was conducted by james levine and the 
orchestral music sang as sweetly as the singers 
the main foursome carol vaness and tatiana troyanos as sisters 
and thomas hampson and jerry hadley as the naval officers theyre 
engaged to have voices of about equal weight medium robust and 
are all attractive looking all voices blended well the voices of 
miss vaness and hadley have rare beauty 
hampsons baritone is attractive and sounds easily produced 
miss troyanos mezzosoprano is confident and she displayed a comic 
touch getting laughs where some mezzos dont but maybe going too 
far in lurching around the stage with a butterfly net 
cosi isnt heavy with plot an elderly cynic bets the men 
that their ladies can be proved inconstant the men dress like a 
vision of ali baba and as albanians woo each others 
fiancees bass richard van allan performed the cynic who wins the 
bet as elegant and worldly wise he sang well but weakened toward 
the end of the opera 
cosi is light hearted but miss vaness and hadley each have 
one serious aria in act 2 both sang with affecting emotion 
margaret price was scheduled to sing fiordiligi but was ill and 
replaced by miss vaness dawn upshaw was scheduled to sing the 
maid her announced replacement heikyung hong became ill betsy 
norden sang the maid pert and clearvoiced 
the simple sets new in 1982 are inside a frame smaller than 
the met opera stage side panels are turned to show trees for park 
scenes or wallpaper for scenes inside a room back panels slide in 
and out furniture is carried in and out by stagehands in peaked 
caps like elves the two men leave for war and return in a 
small boat of the type in which washington crossed the delaware 
lighting by gil wechsler is cheerfully bright 
some think cosi with only six characters and very 
occasional chorus of townspeople shouldnt be performed in a house 
as big as the met if that idea were followed the met audience 
would be greatly deprived

a polaroid camera is the weapon of 
choice for the leftist sandinista front on the 1990 campaign trail 
their foes have picked a guitar player and a burro to drive home 
their political pitch 
just seven weeks before election day and after a christmas 
hiatus punctuated by the us invasion of panama nicaraguas 
political parties are at it again 
the candidates are kissing babies pressing the flesh and 
slinging mud at each other in a crescendo of politicking that will 
climax with the feb 25 balloting 
a billboard showing president daniel ortega hugging one of his 
children has popped up on a managua street corner ortega running 
for reelection with vice president sergio ramirez is now visiting 
cities for the second time in the campaign 
peasants at rallies fight over who will have their picture taken 
next to ortega a polaroid camera clicks the print slides out and 
the peasant goes home with a portrait of himself standing right 
next to the smiling president 
for its party the opposition coalition has hired composer 
pompilio amaya who delights crowds at rallies with his songs 
accompanied by his a guitar then theres pancho the burro who 
wears a cap with the coalitions acronym written on it and is 
paraded before rallies 
publisher violeta barrios de chamorro the opposition 
presidential candidate fell in her home last week and fractured a 
knee she is laid up in a houston hospital for at least another 10 
days 
but her running mate virgilio godoy of the liberal independent 
party is on the campaign trail and became hoarse over the weekend 
from his many public speeches godoy a lawyer and college 
professor is a more polished speaker than mrs chamorro whose 
political experience is limited 
ortega has tactfully avoided targeting mrs chamorros perceived 
lack of great intellectual capacity mrs chamorro is the widow of 
pedro joaquin chamorro a civic leader whose image is in a constant 
tugofwar between the sandinistas and the 14party national 
opposition union 
nicaraguans might construe any personal attack on mrs chamorro 
as an attack on her late husband a political taboo 
real issues abound the dismal state of the economy and how to 
correct it the usbacked contra rebels the draft regional 
guerrilla movements and relations with washington and moscow 
neither the sandinistas nor the opposition has changed the 
substance of its message over christmas the sandinistas blame the 
united states for nearly all the countrys ills the opposition 
blames the sandinistas 
the sandinistas also claim the opposition is getting us 
funding the americans and the opposition both deny it though mrs 
chamorro has visited with us officials 
the frenzy of political graffiti that gripped the city a few 
months back has subsided perhaps that is partly because the 
supreme electoral council the final arbiter of the election 
process has begun urging nicaraguans to respect each other and 
partly because there are few walls left to scrawl on 
but street artists ever resourceful have claimed the ground 
their messages can now be seen on the pavement of highways 
driveways and sidewalks even utility poles bear civic messages 
favoring political parties 
the us invasion of panama on dec 20 has given the sandinistas 
an unforeseen campaign coup it has allowed them to whip up 
nationalist sentiment and gather it around the party it also has 
given them fuel for further identifying the opposition coalition as 
a puppet of washington and the sandinista front as the only hope 
for a sovereign nicaragua 
yet the sandinista campaign slogan everything will be 
better is falling on increasingly cynical ears prices for 
staples keep increasing salaries barely keep up 
the opposition coalition hemmed together from parties ranging 
from conservatives to communists has problems of its own 
the parties only common denominator is that they hate the 
sandinistas enough to stick together at least until an electoral 
victor is declared that raises the question of how harmonious a 
government the alliance could form 
most polls released over the past few months show ortega ahead 
of mrs chamorro who has the advantage of owning the opposition 
newspaper la prensa to help in her campaign the sandinistas have 
barricada the fronts official paper and the progovernment daily 
el nuevo diario 
other poll results show ortega and mrs chamorro in a 
necktoneck race 
a telling item in any of the polls however is the percentage 
of undecideds who constitute nearly as many people as those those 
who say they will vote for ortega or for mrs chamorro

although many thousands of 
suspected government opponents have been murdered by military men 
in the death squads or independent of them not a single 
officer has been convicted of human rights abuses in 10 years of 
civil war 
no military man had been indicted until march 1989 when a 
major a 2nd lieutenant and seven soldiers were accused of killing 
10 peasants in the hamlet of san francisco in september 1988 that 
case since has bogged down 
the governments near paralysis in the san francisco killings 
is merely the latest in a long line of failures to hold members of 
the armed forces accountable for political violence the new 
yorkbased lawyers committee for human rights said in a report last 
year 
in thousands of cases dating back to the 1980 assassination 
of archbishop oscar arnulfo romero the salvadoran military has 
refused to assist prosecutions in many cases senior military 
officers have blatantly interfered with investigations or 
prosecutions preventing them from being carried out the report 
said 
president alfredo cristiani who announced sunday that military 
men committed the nov 16 massacre of six jesuit priests and two 
women contends the era of impunity is over 
he did not specify who was implicated in the crime their 
numbers or their ranks but he announced a blueribbon commission 
would assist the investigation to deduce responsibilities and 
make sure justice is done 
he promised punishment would be meted out down to the last 
person implicated 
el salvadors judicial system is dangerously close to 
collapse said the laywers committee 
that appraisal is shared by us authorities including 
ambassador william walker who says flat out the judiciary does 
not work 
the few cases that get prosecuted are those that receive wide 
publicity affect us public opinion and cause a stir on capitol 
hill 
high profile cases are prosecuted for political reasons 
rather than reasons of justice said a western diplomat but 
that they get prosecuted at all is progress 
the jesuit slayings shocked el salvador and the world and 
prompted calls in the us congress for reappraisal of us aid 
the virtually bankrupt nation has received 4 billion in economic 
and military assistance from washington during the past 10 years 
there are consequences of human rights violations in the 
future vice president dan quayle said during a visit to el 
salvador in february 1989 democracy means human rights and 
decency you cannot have one without the other our commitment and 
our support are conditioned on this process and this system 
of the many cases unsuccessfully prosecuted several stand out 
the most glaring could be the case of romeros assassination on 
march 24 1980 
after a decade of political manipulation the case is virtually 
closed with no one convicted or punished in connection with it 
the previous christian democratic administration of president 
jose napoleon duarte said it knew who planned the killing and who 
carried it out it claimed the oppositioncontrolled legislature 
impeded prosecution to protect implicated members of the republican 
nationalist alliance known as arena including party founder 
roberto daubuisson 
daubuisson and arena which won last years presidential 
election deny any involvement in the archbishops murder 
on jan 3 1981 two us land reform advisers and the head of 
the salvadoran land reform insitute were murdered in the sheraton 
hotel two triggermen both national guard corporals eventually 
were convicted and sentenced but the two officers they both named 
as the instigators of the crime were not convicted 
about 50 residents of the town of armenia were massacred july 
30 1981 by civil guardsmen according to church and human rights 
groups whether the implicated soldiers should be covered by a 1987 
amnesty is still being considered by the courts and no one has 
been convicted in the slayings 
on feb 22 1983 about 70 indian peasants of the las hojas 
agricultural cooperative were killed by troops of the 6th military 
detachment in the western province of sonsonate those implicated 
including three officers were absolved under the 1987 amnesty 
from 1984 to 1987 rights abuses steadily decreased 
humanitarian organizations were alarmed when they rose in 1988 the 
situation continued to degenerate in 1989 
the trend established in the first six months of 1989 indicated 
the number of politically motivated murders easily would surpass 
those in 1988

the bodyslamming behemoths of professional 
wrestling are entertainers and not athletes according to the 
legislature 
the state assembly voted 444 monday to approve a bill that 
would reduce the regulation on those growling scowling giants by 
removing professional wrestling from the jurisdiction of the state 
athletic commission 
the bill passed by the state senate in february awaits action 
by gov thomas h kean 
supporters including the world wrestling federation say the 
measure will reduce the overhead of promoting a wrestling 
exhibition in new jersey and therefore make it easier for fans to 
see warriors such as hulk hogan and rowdy roddy piper in person 
but wrestlers paid a price for the victory by admitting the 
contests are less than spontaneous 
the world wrestling federation which asked for the bill first 
admitted that professional wrestling was more entertainment than 
sport in a trenton legislative hearing in early 1989 
the federation described wrestling as an activity in which 
participants struggle handinhand primarily for the purpose of 
providing entertainment for spectators rather than conducting a 
bonafide athletic contest 
the statement was blasted by several new jersey professional 
wrestlers who insisted that theirs is not a cream puff job 
but the federations position won out partly because it wants 
easier access to the lucrative new jersey market which includes 
the atlantic city casinos

secretary of state james a baker iii will 
hold talks in moscow next month to try to clear the way for a new 
treaty with the soviet union sharply reducing longrange nuclear 
missiles bush administration officials disclosed 
baker also is considering a visit to prague after the feb 67 
meeting to demonstrate us support for the peaceful transition in 
czechoslovakia from a hardline communist government to a more 
moderate regime the officials told the associated press on monday 
he may stop in other east and central european countries as 
well said the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the trip to moscow is one of three sessions baker intends to 
hold with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze before a 
june ussoviet summit meeting in washington 
the projected centerpiece of the summit is a treaty to slash 
us and soviet arsenals of longrange bombers submarines and 
missiles by 30 percent to 50 percent 
the most complex of the three obstacles baker will try to 
overcome with shevardnadze concerns how longrange airlaunched 
cruise missiles carried by bombers should be counted against a 
treaty limit of 6000 strategic warheads 
the two other issues are the kind of data from missile tests 
that could be disguised and where surplus or nondeployed 
missiles would be stored 
even settling those three issues would not wrap up the new 
strategic arms reduction treaty that president bush and soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev would like to sign at the washington 
summit 
for instance the two sides are in sharp disagreement at the 
negotiating table in geneva over sealaunched cruise missiles 
bush at the malta summit last month resisted gorbachevs efforts 
to curb the elusive weapon which is carried on submarines and 
surface vessels 
the soviets still are trying to slow down or trim the us 
strategic defense initiative which would place nuclear weapons 
into space as part of a defense against a ballistic missile attack 
however the soviets may be willing to set aside those two 
disputes which would mean that resolving the three other problems 
would be a major step toward completing the pact 
a stop in prague would be scheduled by baker after his talks in 
moscow and before his arrival feb 13 in ottawa for an eastwest 
conference on bushs open skies proposal the officials said 
the 16 nato countries and the seven members of the warsaw pact 
meet in the canadian capital to discuss allowing unarmed aircraft 
to fly over their territory in search of suspected military 
activity 
baker visited east germany last month demonstrating support for 
the reformist communist government he also went to poland and 
hungary with bush in july 
czechoslovakias shift to a more moderate system has occurred 
without the strife evident in romania east germany and bulgaria 
baker may be prepared to offer us aid if it is requested 
state department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler asked about 
bakers travel plans said only that he would be going to the 
soviet union later this year

democratic leaders in congress arent rushing 
to embrace president bushs renewed bid for a cut in capital gains 
taxes but neither are they rejecting it out of hand 
well have to see what the specific proposals are said a 
spokesman for senate majority leader george j mitchell dmaine 
who led last years successful fight against a reduction 
mitchell his spokesman said has not ruled out supporting a cut 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance 
committee pledged late last year to consider a capital gains cut 
as part of a package of saving and investment incentives bentsen 
spokesman jack devore said monday 
bush who campaigned for president in 1988 on a pledge to reduce 
taxes on capital gains renewed the battle in a speech monday to 
the american farm bureau in orlando fla a reduction he said 
would boost investment and create jobs 
for us to reap the full benefits of a competitive economy we 
must cut the capitalgains tax rate bush told a cheering 
audience passage of our capitalgains proposal which would 
apply to the sale of farmland will be one of my top priorities in 
this legislative year 
bush listed enactment of cleanair and anticrime legislation 
among his priorities 
it is past time for congress to tend to some of the unfinished 
business bush said 
with the backing of one of every four democrats and an almost 
solid bloc of republicans the house last year approved a 
bushsupported cut in taxes on capital gains profits from the sale 
of investments the proposal died in the senate when republicans 
fell nine votes short of the 60 needed to cut off a democratic 
filibuster against it 
democratic leaders in the house and senate opposed the cut on 
three counts 
they cited estimates that 80 percent of the benefit would go to 
those with incomes over 100000 a year they said the reduction 
would strike a major blow against the landmark 1986 tax overhaul 
that ended preferential treatment of capital gains and they 
rejected bushs contention that a reduction would generate so much 
investment that government revenues would actually increase 
in his brief remarks on the issue monday bush mentioned neither 
the revenue implications nor the 1986 tax law 
but on the third point he said i am sick and tired of the 
demagogues who call this a tax cut for the rich it means jobs it 
means savings and it is good for all americans 
a mitchell spokesman noted that the majority leader supported a 
lower capital gains tax when congress was debating the 1986 
overhaul 
mitchell has said he will continue to support one if it meets 
three criteria if it doesnt adversely affect the budget deficit 
if it is targeted and if it is part of a fair and progressive tax 
structure the spokesman said 
that third condition could mean that bush and mitchell will 
continue to be at odds over capital gains 
mitchells definition of a fair and progressive tax 
structure has been one that would mean a higher income tax rate 
for highincome americans the kind of tax increase that the 
administration has vowed to oppose 
bush is expected to provide details of his capital gains 
proposal in the budget that he will send to congress on jan 29 
some key republicans are expecting the new plan to provide a 
greater tax benefit for longerheld assets rather than to give the 
same incentive to all property 
present law fully taxes capital gains at the same rates that 
apply to wages and other income in his budget last year bush 
recommended that 45 percent of capital gains from selected assets 
specifically excluding farmland and timber for example be 
excluded from tax 
the house voted instead for a plan that for 2 years would 
have excluded from tax 30 percent of the gain on a broader list of 
assets including farmland and timber after that time only the 
gain caused solely by inflation would have been taxed 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and 
means committee tried to block approval of the cut last year 
spokesman jim jaffe said monday that rostenkowski is wary of any 
new proposed reduction but expects it would take a unified 
democratic effort to defeat it

briar cook is savoring the sweet smell 
of success the us forest service engineer has solved the 
longstanding problem of getting the stench out of the stalls at 
wilderness restrooms 
delighted administrators in washington dc have formally 
declared 1990 the year of the sweetsmelling toilet and plan 
to retrofit all 12000 toilets in use on forest service land 
nationwide 
another 300 new latrines built annually will incorporate cooks 
breakthrough findings which followed years of research at a forest 
service lab northeast of los angeles 
the public today expects a higher level of service and more 
amenities and part of that is a goodsmelling toilet said 
richard woodrow the forest services acting director of 
recreation well were going to give it to them 
within three years officials say americans wont find a single 
smelly latrine in any of their 134 national forests costs are 
estimated at up to 1500 each for the retrofitted toilets 
cooks other research projects at the san dimas technology and 
development center have included ways to bearproof garbage cans 
but he says he considers toilets his best work 
our society is funny about toilets no one wants to talk 
about them he said but the odor problem affects a lot of 
people as an engineer i view it as a challenge 
cook found that the basic design of national forest toilets 
prevented adequate ventilation he also determined that vent stacks 
were being clogged by undiscovered spider webs 
through tests in a wind tunnel cook showed that a wider vent 
stack stretching much higher above the roof line greatly improves 
the expulsion of odors solarpowered fans also help pull the fetid 
air from the chamber he found 
as for why no one else noticed the contributing spider web 
problem cook said nobody likes these little cabanas so why 
would they go crawling around inside them its in and out as fast 
as possible nobody ever bothered to look in that stack 
the problem of ridding forestland toilets of their odor had 
stumped many before cook gripes about smelly toilets have been 
common since the first national forest outhouse was installed in 
the early 1900s woodrow said 
for decades restroom odor has been the no 1 complaint received 
by rangers from california to new hampshire he said leading to a 
common conclusion 
we figured that toilets stink period take it or leave it 
woodrow said 
but the tenacious cook proved them wrong he said he hopes 
ultimately to share his design with the national park service the 
army corps of engineers and other public lands managers all 
plagued with pungent potties 
its a universal problem cook said

two disc jockeys brought a 15foot replica 
of elvis presleys head to graceland the dead singers former 
residence on the day he would have turned 55 graceland managers 
were not pleased 
the head which had been part of a float in the tournament of 
roses parade briefly joined fans gathered outside the 
whitecolumned residence monday presley died of heart disease at 
the mansion on aug 16 1977 
about 1500 people representing 40 presley fan clubs from around 
the world came to memphis to mark the birthday said patsy 
andersen fan club liaison for the graceland division of elvis 
presley enterprises some fans cut a cake and sang happy birthday 
the disc jockeys who brought the replica head brian phelps and 
marc thompson of station klos in los angeles were permanently 
banned from graceland last year for using hidden microphones to 
broadcast from inside the residence graceland spokesman todd 
morgan said 
carey curelop program manager for the radio station said the 
disc jockeys brought the head to memphis as a peace offering 
but graceland managers told the announcers to take the head and 
move on 
morgan said the parade float had been a beautiful tribute to 
presley 
theyve taken that and changed it and turned it into something 
distasteful its really sad morgan said 
the disc jockeys took the flatbed truck carrying the head to a 
nearby parking lot and broadcast for about an hour curelop said 
from los angeles 
the head was part of a float sent to the rose parade by the 
state of mississippi it was taken to jackson miss after the 
stop in memphis curelop said presley was born in tupelo miss

commercial banks already reeling from soft 
real estate markets in the northeast and other regions are 
beginning to suffer from a increase in sour consumer loans a 
regulator says 
we are concerned about a significant rise in nonperforming 
consumer loans at banks around the country said comptroller of 
the currency robert l clarke the chief regulator of nationally 
chartered banks 
clarke in a speech to the institute of international bankers on 
monday said his agency had not determined whether the problem is 
confined to one region or if it is a risk to the entire banking 
system 
however statistics compiled by a banking trade group show 
consumer loan problems concentrated in new york and several new 
england states the same areas where lackluster real estate markets 
are causing banks loan problems 
we are analyzing the data and trying to determine precisely 
what this implies for the overall condition of the national banking 
system clarke said he delivered his speech in new york city a 
copy was released in washington 
on other topics clarke predicted the trend toward bank 
consolidation would continue he said about 11000 banks would 
exist at the end of 1992 compared with 12600 now and 14400 in 
1980 he also said more banks would be owned by foreigners in 
coming years 
the american bankers association a trade group representing 
commercial banks reported last month that the number of consumers 
30 days or more behind on their loans soared to a 10year high in 
the julyseptember quarter 
nationally 288 percent of the loans surveyed at 800 banks were 
delinquent on sept 30 compared with 23 percent three months 
earlier the delinquency rate was greater than 4 percent in four 
states connecticut 605 percent vermont 535 percent 
massachusetts 48 percent and new york 444 percent 
the economies of some northeastern states have been in the 
doldrums in part because the 1987 stock market crash depressed 
employment in the financial service industry including brokerage 
firms banks and insurance companies 
at the same time that consumer lending is becoming more chancy 
federal deposit insurance corp statistics show that banks are 
becoming more involved in it 
loans to individuals grew by 52 percent from the third quarter 
of 1988 to the same period of 1989 according to the fdic thats 
slightly higher than the 42 percent growth rate for all banks 
assets but far below the 131 percent growth for real estate loans 
loans to individuals represented 12 percent of banks 32 
trillion in assets at the end of the third quarter consumer loans 
made up 59 percent of all bad assets 
economist paul getman of the wefa group a bala cynwyd pa 
consulting company said banks face a growing problem with what he 
called property risk 
because home prices have been falling in some regions more 
consumers are discovering that the outstanding balance on home 
equity loans exceeds the equity in their house the same is true of 
auto loans when consumers find after several years that they owe 
more money than their car is worth 
once consumers figure this out they just hand the keys over 
to the bank whether its a car a mobile home or a house he 
said 
however getman said the souring of consumer loan portfolios 
while a matter of concern is not nearly as severe as the problem 
posed by bad real estate loans 
unless you have an outright recession and the unemployment 
rate shoots up i dont think consumer loans will become a major 
problem he said on credit cards banks charge such high 
interest rates that they can easily see delinquency rates double 
and still make money

governments of major industrial countries are 
moving toward agreement to send at least 25 billion including 
about 10 billion from the united states to help third world and 
east european countries 
but agreement in the international monetary fund may be harder 
to duplicate in congress where deficitconscious lawmakers would 
have a hard time diverting money from domestic programs that have 
been taking cuts for years 
therell be trouble getting congress to approve a 
congressional aide who follows the issue closely said monday 
a lot of congressmen will resist giving all that money to 
foreigners while their own favorite programs are being cut at home 
some of them dont make the distinction that the money is only 
being lent out and we get interest back on it 
the aide who spoke on condition of anonymity recalled the last 
us contribution of 85 billion to the fund was approved by a 
narrow margin in 1983 but the widespread feeling that eastern 
europe must be helped will carry much weight with in congress he 
said 
the imf works out agreements with borrowing countries on new 
policy programs they usually include a large dose of austerity for 
the people in the borrowing nation 
when agreements are reached the fund lends heavily to support 
them its most recent accord due for final approval this month 
will provide polands new noncommunist leadership with 710 
million this year 
poland in turn has moved toward a market economy ending price 
controls and promising to sell or shut down government industries 
that are running heavy losses 
lowerlevel officials in washington are trying to set the exact 
figure of the total contribution this week and resolve the question 
of japans share if they fail canadian finance minister michael 
w wilson is expected to call together treasury secretary nicholas 
f brady and other leaders to make the decision at the end of this 
month 
the fund now has resources worth about 117 billion but much of 
it is in the form of unconvertible third world currencies that 
borrowers do not need

riegle dmich planned to use a 30minute news interview 
program in which he discussed his involvement in the affair as 
part of the media campaign hoping to broadcast the entire program 
on cable television 
but wxyztv in detroit on which the program was broadcast dec 
10 said monday it would not give permission to riegle to use the 
program karolyn wallace a spokeswoman for riegle said the 
senators broadcast plans on cable were being canceled because of 
the stations response 
riegle chairman of the senate banking committee deconcini and 
the other senators are facing ethics investigations in connection 
with their dealings with the failing thrift amid allegations they 
intervened with regulators on behalf of the banks president 
deconcini is shelling out 190000 for newspaper advertisements 
and television commercials in his state to tell his version of the 
affair 
i have decided to take my case directly to the people of 
arizona deconcini said last friday i do this not as a 
criticism of the press but because i do not believe that the facts 
have been adequately heard and understood 
the other three senators are defending themselves in a variety 
of forums but have yet to pay for newspaper or broadcast access to 
voters according to spokesmen 
the center of riegles counterattack was to have been the 
30minute television interview last dec 10 on which the senator 
responded to questions about his involvement with keating 
the program was a fair presentation a tough and frank 
discussion of the issue said ms wallace 
but wxyztv news director bob rowe said monday his station would 
not give permission for a rebroadcast of the program saying if 
permission were given the program becomes a political tool and we 
have to be unbiased 
on the program riegle was questioned by two reporters and a 
moderator riegle had planned to pay for the rebroadcast out of 
campaign funds ms wallace said 
the other three senators involved in the affair are sens john 
mccain of arizona john glenn of ohio and alan cranston of 
california all except mccain are democrats 
at the center of the controversy are two meetings they had on 
keatings behalf with federal regulators the five received a total 
of more than 13 million in campaign contributions from keating 
who headed the irvine calif thrift and his associates 
the government seized control of lincoln on april 14 1989 and 
the cost to taxpayers is expected to reach a record 2 billion 
the senators dubbed the keating five by critics deny 
wrongdoing in their involvement with him and his savings and loan 
they have said their actions were normal constituent services and 
were not influenced by keatings campaign donations 
riegle who later returned the money he received from keating 
and his associates began granting interviews on the subject in 
november to home state reporters saying he wanted to set the 
record straight 
glenn has held lengthy news conferences and interviews 
including meetings with newspaper editorial boards in ohio but has 
no plans to advertise spokeswoman rebecca bell said 
cranston has attended public meetings at which questions were 
raised about his involvement in the lincoln case and he took them 
as they came spokeswoman victoria lion said he has been very 
accessible to the press 
mccain has not considered advertising spokesman scott 
celley said hes found no absence of opportunity to tell his 
side of the story

prices of home heating oil would not have 
risen as sharply last month if the government had allowed energy 
companies to use foreignflagged vessels to carry fuel to the 
northeast from other us ports officials said 
suppliers were unable to shift some cargoes of home heating oil 
from other parts of the country at the height of the december cold 
snap because the customs service refused to waive a jones act ban 
on the use of foreign vessels between domestic ports 
the customs service acted on the advice of the transportation 
departments maritime administration which argued that waivers 
were not justified because us vessels were available to transport 
the fuel walter oates a spokesman for the maritime agency said 
monday 
its our mandate to promote the usflagged industry he 
said 
the energy department which intervened in support of the waiver 
applications contended that while some us vessels technically 
were available to carry home heating oil they could not meet the 
companies delivery schedules 
the shipments would not have eliminated fuel shortages that hit 
parts of the northeast and midwest during the second half of 
december but the extra supplies might have kept prices from rising 
so high industry and government officials said 
it absolutely would have made a difference said edwin 
rothschild energy policy director of citizen action a national 
consumer organization 
home heating oil prices soared from about 80 cents a gallon in 
late november to as much as 140 a gallon in some areas by the end 
of the year far beyond the increases consumers usually see when 
the winter heating season arrives 
having the extra supply that was restricted would have 
helped said phil chisholm executive vice president of the 
petroleum marketers association of america a trade group of 
petroleum product suppliers 
chisholms group was among several industry and consumer groups 
scheduled to testify today at a house energy and commerce 
subcommittee hearing on the december heating fuel crisis some 
state officials have called for a federal investigation of the oil 
industry which they accuse of engineering the price rise 
rep philip sharp dind who heads the subcommittee warned 
consumers not to expect any immediate price relief from washington 
indications monday were that the price may be dropping this month 
as fast as it rose in december 
its extremely unlikely that there would be a reinstatement of 
major price controls that we had in the past decade sharp said 
adding that congress lacked the resources to fully explore 
allegations of price fixing 
the oil industry says the main reason for the price increases 
and localized shortages of home heating oil and propane was the 
unusual spell of severe cold last month they also acknowledge that 
company fuel inventories were significantly lower than usual the 
problem has eased in recent days as the weather warmed 
in an attempt to relieve a supply squeeze that hit particularly 
hard in the northeast energy companies in december submitted 11 
applications to the federal government for permission to use 
foreignflagged ships to move fuel between us ports according to 
an energy department official who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity 
of the 11 applications six were withdrawn because the 
foreignflagged vessels in question were hired by some other 
company or were otherwise made unavailable before the government 
acted on the waiver request the energy department official said 
a waiver was granted to bay state gas co of canton mass to 
use a danishflagged ship to carry 100000 barrels of propane 
requests from three other companies to move home heating oil with 
foreign vessels were turned down oates said

a convicted drug smuggler who says he was 
manuel antonio noriegas gobetween with the medellin cartel is a 
key witness in the cocaine trafficking case against the deposed 
panamanian dictator 
floyd carlton caceres who is serving a nineyear prison term 
for drug smuggling has testified he arranged for the cartel to pay 
noriega 200000 for each planeload of cocaine protected during 
flights through panama 
carlton is one of several convicted drug traffickers likely to 
testify against noriega who is accused of taking 46 million 
bribes and other payoffs to give colombian drug lords a safe 
haven in panama for cocaine shipments to the united states 
like most convicted criminals who become prosecution witnesses 
carltons credibility will be sharply tested if he testifies at a 
trial of noriega in miami 
but legal experts note testimony from such disreputable 
witnesses is commonplace in drug trials and prosecutors have been 
able to persuade jurors to accept it particularly if supported by 
other evidence 
the credibility of unsavory witnesses is not an unsurmountable 
problem especially if you have more than one person saying the 
same thing or describing things that lead to the same conclusion 
said a former federal prosecutor who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
other witnesses expected to testify against noriega are jose 
blandon a former panamanian diplomat and onetime confidant of the 
general and convicted smugglers ramon milian rodriguez and steven 
m kalish 
blandon who broke with noriega in 1988 told the senate and a 
federal grand jury about a dispute between colombian drug lords and 
noriega that was mediated by cuban leader fidel castro 
blandon testified the 1984 meeting took place after panamanian 
authorities raided a drug processing plant arresting 23 colombians 
and lt col julian melo secretary general of noriegas staff the 
raid occurred while noriega was in paris 
blandon said the outraged colombians claimed they had paid melo 
5 million to protect the processing plant 
soon after noriega met with castro the colombians and melo were 
freed and equipment and 3 million seized during the raid were 
returned to the colombians blandon said 
both castro and noriega have denounced blandons story as a lie 
but his testimony would dovetail with that of carlton to show 
that noriega protected the medellin cartels operations in panama 
blandon has not been accused by federal prosecutors of 
involvement in drug trafficking and his miami attorney atlee 
wampler dismissed attempts by defense lawyers in public statements 
to question blandons reliability 
blandon attended some key meetings as noriegas de facto 
secretary of state but he had absolutely no involvement in any 
shape with drug trafficking wampler said he was never 
involved thats why defense lawyers want to discredit him 
support for the accounts of carlton and blandon could also come 
from further testimony by kalish and rodriguez 
both have previously described the protection noriega gave the 
drug traffickers including armoredcar transport of money and the 
use of military airfields 
prosecutors could get even more corroboration if any of the five 
noriega codefendants in custody decides to plead guilty and become 
a government witness to get a reduced sentence 
an attorney for one of those codefendants luis del cid 
indicated monday his client was considering testifying against his 
former boss 
there was a very preliminary exchange of amenities where the 
possibility of some settlement was discussed defense attorney 
samuel burstyn said of discussions with federal prosecutors in 
miami 
were desirous of exploring all options but no offers have 
been made on either side and there are no deals he said 
del cid 46 who surrendered dec 25 to us forces was one of 
noriegas liaisons with drug traffickers and also served as a 
courier according to the indictment 
he is accused of arranging for the transportation of payments to 
noriega from the drug cartel 
if he became a government witness del cid presumably could 
directly corroborate carlton about one episode described in the 
indictment 
at noriegas direction carlton delivered 200000 to del cid at 
the headquarters of the panamanian defense forces the indictment 
alleges 
the payment was to cover the price that noriega and carlton 
agreed they would charge the colombians to protect the next 
shipment of cocaine through panama the indictment said 
shortly after the payment was delivered to del cid carlton is 
alleged to have flown 400 kilograms of cocaine to a panamanian 
airstrip from the farm of medellin cartel leader pablo escobar 
gaviria

the state department is accusing the soviet 
union of playing a key role in supporting a military offensive by 
the angolan government against usbacked rebels 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler called monday on 
angolas mpla government and its soviet allies to stop the 
offensive immediately and concentrate on the peace process 
we are very concerned about the dangerous escalation of 
offensive military action by the mpla against unitacontrolled 
territory in southeastern angola she said that this offensive 
action is receiving close support from the substantial number of 
soviet military advisers at the front line is increasing our 
concern 
the unita rebels are believed to receive more than 40 million 
annually from the united states 
meanwhile an angola peace conference scheduled to start 
wednesday has been postponed indefinitely us officials said the 
presidents of eight african nations had been scheduled to go to the 
angolan capital of luanda for the conference 
ms tutwiler tempered her criticism of the angolans by noting 
that president jose eduardo dos santos has indicated interest in 
discussing seriously some key issues in the 14year civil war 
she urged the mpla government to take its proposals to zaires 
president mobutu sese seko who has led a peace effort 
according to us officials after several weeks of logistical 
preparations mpla forces launched an attack dec 23 against 
unitacontrolled areas along the kuzumbia river 
there had been high hopes in june for a peace settlement but a 
ceasefire agreement broke down in august and there has been 
intermittent fighting since efforts to revive the ceasefire and 
promote direct negotiations have not prospered 
us officials were unable to give a reason for the postponement 
of the jan 10 angola peace summit 
a year ago the state department was praising moscow for helping 
to promote steps toward peace in southern africa including an 
agreement that calls for the gradual withdrawal of all cuban forces 
from angola by 1991 
but a senior government official insisting on anonymity said 
monday that the administration is disappointed about the soviet 
role in angola over the past year 
the official said soviet aid to angola in 1989 totaled about 
600 million a slight reduction from the 1988 figure 
he said the administration thought the soviets would reduce 
their aid further as a means of nudging the angolans toward 
negotiations 
the angolans seem to have a more favorable view of an election 
process than before but have not accepted the idea of negotiating 
with unita the official said 
one of the most divisive issues has been the angolan 
governments refusal to allow unita participation in multiparty 
elections

the organization of american states which 
criticized the us invasion of panama last month says the 
incursion by us troops into the nicaraguan ambassadors residence 
there was a violation of international law 
after 3 hours of debate monday night the oas permanent council 
approved a resolution criticizing the action by a 190 vote the 
united states and six other countries mostly from the 
englishspeaking caribbean countries abstained 
us ambassador luigi einaudi saying the united states has 
apologized for the dec 29 incident and taken steps to guard 
against a recurrence said the resolution served no purpose other 
than antiuspropaganda 
einaudi said he did not oppose the resolution because the united 
states supports the laws that spell out the inviolability of 
diplomatic missions 
the key paragraph of the resolution declares that the serious 
events that transpired are as has been recognized a violation of 
the privileges and immunities recognized under international law 
the session was far less tendentious than the one shortly before 
christmas when 20 oas nations criticized the united states for its 
invasion of panama the us cast the lone opposition vote but 
some countries abstained 
the troops entered the residence nine days after the invasion as 
part of their effort to restore order according to einaudi 
efforts by the troops have led to the confiscation of 75000 
weapons 
but nicaraguan delegate victoria castillo dismissed einaudis 
explanations and said the incursion was a deliberate 
provocation 
she called on the united states to provide just and 
immediate reparations for the damage done to the residence this 
she said would make it possible to believe that the united 
states has indeed recognized its error and is disposed not to 
commit such an error again 
the incident has generated uneasiness among some us career 
diplomats who believe that what happened in panama could serve as 
a precedent for the penetration of an american embassy somewhere by 
radical forces 
it puts in jeopardy american diplomatic missions all over the 
world said perry shankle a former president of the american 
foreign service association 
the day after the incident president bush called it a screw 
up but criticized the nicaraguan ambassador for having 
automatic weapons up to his eyeballs in the house there were 
12 ak47 rifles among other weapons in the residence 
the nicaraguan ambassador to panama antenor ferrey flew here 
for the meeting and called for strong action against the united 
states 
if no such action is taken he said diplomats will be thought 
of as cannon fodder by those who can only understand the use of 
force 
einaudi said however that the us troops made efforts to 
confirm independently the address of the nicaraguan ambassador and 
had concluded he lived elsewhere after a check of the diplomatic 
lists 
once the troops realized their mistake he said they withdrew 
after returning all weapons he said there were no arrests and he 
denied that any damage was done to the residence 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega retaliated by expelling 20 
us diplomats from managua

weather remained a threat today as 
nasa once again fueled space shuttle columbia for a satellite 
rescue mission 
the winged spaceship grounded monday by low clouds was 
scheduled to lift off with its five astronauts during a 58minute 
launch opportunity that was starting at 735 am 
the period is determined by the location of the science 
laboratory that the space travelers hope to retrieve before it 
falls back to earth perhaps in march 
meterologists said there was a 70 percent chance the weather 
would be favorable at launch time but a cold front moving through 
central and south florida threatened to shroud the launch area in 
clouds 
after assessing the weather late monday shuttle managers 
directed technicians to once more pump 524000 gallons of liquid 
hydrogen and oxygen into columbias huge external fuel tank 
launch director bob sieck conducted a stopandgo countdown and 
waited until the last possible minute before scrubbing the launch 
monday 
it looks like we will have to call it a day sieck told the 
astronauts when it became apparent the skies would not be clear 
enough 
it had been fairly clear over the launch pad but a 30milewide 
bank of clouds approaching from the west at 6000 feet would have 
made an emergency landing difficult for commander dan brandenstein 
who would have to land the spaceship on a concrete runway near the 
pad 
the flight is the first of a record 10 shuttle missions the 
space agency has scheduled in 1990 planned for 10 days it is the 
second longest flight yet in the program 
the astronauts first task will be to deploy a navy 
communications satellite during the second day 
from the beginning of the trip brandenstein and pilot jim 
wetherbee were to execute a series of intricate maneuvers to 
gradually track down over several days a satellite which has 
orbited earth for nearly six years 
the target is long duration exposure facility ldef which is 
the size of a small school bus and is packed with 57 experiments 
containing a wealth of scientific and technological information 
from its long exposure to space 
once the satellite is caught mission specialist bonnie dunbar 
will reach out with the shuttles remote 50foot arm to snare the 
21400pound package which is 30 feet long and 14 feet in diameter 
it will be like hunting a speck in the sky brandenstein 
said in a recent interview but nasa has plenty experience doing 
this type of rendezvous and jim and i have practiced it to 
perfection in the simulator 
the satellite is 202 miles up but atmospheric drag has been 
pulling it to earth at the rate of about half a mile a day the 
rate will increase as it gets closer 
if the satellite cant be retrieved trackers estimate it will 
fall into the atmosphere and burn up about march 9 its experiments 
lost forever 
once the satellite is secure in the shuttle cargo bay 
brandenstein wetherbee dunbar and mission specialists marsha 
ivins and david low will concentrate on experiments for the rest of 
the flight the emphasis will be on materials processing and tests 
of how the human body adapts to weightlessness 
the 10day missions schedule is to be 10 hours shorter than 
ninth shuttle flight in november 1983 and is a stepping stone for 
even longer ones columbia is being modified to stay aloft 16 days 
starting with a 1993 flight 
scientists are eager to examine ldef primarily to learn how 
various materials and systems have withstood the long stay in 
orbit the information will help in designing a permanent manned 
space station and other longterm spacecraft such as those planned 
for the star wars missile defense system

ralph corrado 57 sold rosies diner to jerry berta a ceramic 
sculptor from michigan who stopped inside by chance in december on 
his way to a new york city art show 
corrado said the diner will close for good sunday and he will 
retire 
the vintage dining car restaurant achieved a modicum of fame 
between 1970 and 1975 when procter amp gamble featured it in a

who wields the paper towels against the counter spills of clumsy 
truck drivers 
corrado renamed the diner for rosie 
until three years ago the diner was open 24 hours a day seven 
days a week but corrado said it got to be too much 
berta refused to say how much he paid for the diner which he 
calls a classic of the dining car genre built in 1945 by the 
paramount dining car co 
i bought it because i got tired of driving out east to eat in 
diners and this is my favorite diner in the country said the 
rockford mich artist who works out of a studio and gallery that 
was formerly a diner 
the diner will be divided in two and placed on trucks for the 
trip at an as yet undetermined time

the key index on the tokyo stock exchange plunged 
tuesday while the dollar rose against the japanese yen 
the dollar closed at 14497 yen up 045 yen from mondays close 
of 14452 yen it opened lower at 14425 yen and ranged between 
14425 yen and 14525 yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average shed 34350 points or 090 
percent ending at 3795146 the lowest since dec 12 when the 
index recorded 3780353 
dealers said the nikkeis plunge tuesday was prompted by many 
factors such as political uncertainties in the soviet union a 
decline in bond prices and a stock plunge in argentina 
market players were discouraged by the news reports about the 
soviet union and argentina and stepped off to the sidelines soon 
after the morning session started said masayoshi yano a dealer 
with nikko securities co 
the soviet government daily izvestia reported monday that 
violence has been developing along the sovietiranian border with 
protesters from soviet azerbaijan destroying border posts 
in another part of azerbaijan the official soviet news agency 
tass said acts of sabotage hostagetaking and sniper fire were 
continuing in the disputed district of nagornokarabakh 
in argentina the countrys leading stocks plunged by 53 percent 
monday when the market reopened for the first time in more than a 
week 
the fall was due in part to the shortage of australs in 
circulation analysts said on jan 1 the government unilaterally 
converted several billion dollars worth of shortterm certificates 
of deposit to 10year bonds 
also the yens weakness on the foreign exchange market monday 
as well as falling bond prices in the futures market discouraged 
japanese investors nikko securities yano said the futures bond 
price made a sharp 099yen oneday drop to 101 yen 
investors remained cautious trying to watch bond price 
movements and the international situation he said 
in currency dealings the dollar strengthened during morning 
trading here following a cut in the prime rate by major us banks 
overnight traders said 
as domestic and international political uncertainties developed 
market players discarded the yen and bought the dollar as a safer 
investment tool said toru kanai a currency analyst with new japan 
securities co 
until the election here the yen wont be very attractive to 
many investors he said a major parliamentary election is 
expected later in february but the government has not finalized 
the schedule 
the prime rate cut in the united states didnt make the dollar 
much weaker and today everybodys selling the yen here he said 
but kanai said the bank of japan intermittently conducted 
dollarselling to support the yen which should keep the dollar 
within the 145146 yen range 
the central bank does not comment on its monetary actions 
the dollars overnight slip followed its similar downswing in 
the new york market monday after many banks cut their prime lending 
rate by a halfpercentage point to 10 percent 
the primerate cut reflects more liberal credit policies by the 
federal reserve bank and will lower borrowing costs for businesses 
and consumers

gov madeleine kunin wants vermont to 
become the first state to ban all disposable diapers but her plan 
is being trashed by some including daycare operators who want no 
part of a mountain of cloth 
the time has come to be responsible and to find the way to say 
yes yes to required statewide recycling to bans on certain 
polluting products to changes in lifestyle kunin said in her 
state of the state speech last week 
only nebraska has banned disposable diapers but it allows the 
sale of diapers that are biodegradable even though such products 
arent believed to break down in the depths of oxygenstarved dumps 
kunin whose proposal would ban disposable diapers by 1993 
noted that while the usable life of a disposable diaper may be a 
few hours they wont decompose in dumps for hundreds of years or 
several generations of babies later 
environmental groups have quickly supported the plan by kunin 
who last year made the state the first to ban the sale of vehicles 
that use ozonedepleting chemicals in their air conditioning that 
ban starts with 1993 models 
they are a large part of the waste stream said ned farquhar 
of the vermont natural resources council the throwaway society 
is wasting energy and materials not just with diapers but with a 
lot of similar products we need to ban things to keep people from 
using them 
the piles of discarded diapers make up about 2 percent of the 
nations waste and about 85 percent of all parents use disposable 
diapers exclusively according to industry estimates 
vermont officials estimate that 435 million disposable diapers 
end up in the states dumps every year 
opponents of a ban argue that the governors plan wont have 
much impact in solving the states mounting garbage disposal 
problem representatives of the health and daycare industries also 
say they are not ready to handle such a ban 
there has been a tendency to pass into law programs on the 
basis of trendy catchwords rather than science or careful 
consideration of all the different issues said william gilbert 
a lobbyist representing the american paper institute 
gilbert said that mandating cloth diapers would add two to three 
more loads of hotwater washings weekly for families with babies 
raising its own questions about environmental damage 
daycare centers especially in rural parts of the state where 
there are no cloth diaper services fear how they would be affected 
if a ban went into effect today it would create real havoc 
said lea hatch a daycare regulator for the state but she added 
that centers in areas with access to diaper services already are 
beginning to offer that option to parents in lieu of disposables 
bethany carleton head of the vermont health care association 
also said disposable diapers help prevent skin problems better than 
cloth ones there are definitely reasons people dont want to go 
back to cloth she said 
vermonters also are debating the wisdom of a ban in general 
windsor county sen john carroll a republican who has joined 
the democratic governor in the proposal said he could understand 
the reluctance to a mandate 
but he added i think this needs to be talked about a lot more 
carefully than it has been i think this is the year to do it now 
is time to take advantage of public awareness of the crisis in 
solid waste 
david wilson a former state secretary of administration said 
bans dont serve the environmental movement well 
they engender public resentment of what are otherwise sound 
environmental policies wilson said the public has a strong 
reaction to mandates when you do try to mandate you may be 
throwing the baby out with the bathwater

one rhode island dump cant get enough 
of trash so its may give a special deal for garbage 
the states price of 59 a ton to dump at the central landfill 
in johnston prompted companies to haul trash out of state 
rhode island officials facing an 8 million shortfall in 
projected revenues of 22 million from commercial dumping are 
considering a price reduction said michael carroll associate 
director of finance for the state solid waste management corp 
but the issue isnt as simple as making the price competitive 
the quasipublic corporation still needs enough money to carry 
out its legislative mandate of developing a complete waste disposal 
system from incinerators to recycling 
when state officials in august raised the tipping fee at 
central landfill to 59 a ton from 10 they thought it would be 
competitive with landfills in neighboring states state officials 
had surveyed the dump market within 100 miles of rhode island 
what went wrong 
we didnt get current information carroll said with some 
new landfills and incinerators opening massachusetts has a glut 
and they were able to take in some of the rhode island trash 
at the same time cities and towns by law must pay only 13 per 
ton increasing 75 percent a year 
trash haulers say they started bypassing the dump for reasons 
other than just price some blame the states mandatory recycling 
rules that took effect this year the recycling laws require that 
no more than 20 percent of a load brought to the landfill be 
recyclable 
using outofstate incinerators is about breakeven with 
dumping it at the central landfill said david wilson vice 
president of trukaway of rhode island inc but if it means 
avoiding the 500 fine for a load with too much recyclable 
material its worth it he said 
as long as 20 percent by weight is the criteria now for 
violating the law lowering the rates wouldnt make any 
difference he said when the rate went up it made everybody 
look into recycling faster 
that raises the important question if the states stressing 
recycling to lengthen the life of a dump how does it reach the 
delicate balance of enough revenue to run the recycling program 
while not attracting too much trash so it runs out of room 
we havent gotten that far carroll said

art buchwalds victory over paramount 
pictures about rights to coming to america was hailed as a 
triumph for writers but the studio feared the court decision could 
mean a rash of bogus lawsuits 
i am very very happy buchwald said in a telephone 
interview after a judge ruled monday that paramount must pay him 
for the script idea he claimed was the basis for the hit eddie 
murphy movie coming to america 
this thing is not only an important thing for me buchwald 
said i think its really important for writers 
superior court judge harvey a schneider ruled that coming to 
america was based upon a material element of or was inspired 
by a synopsis buchwald wrote entitled king for a day 
the evidence is overwhelming that for two years paramount 
considered king for a day to be a project that was being 
developed for eddie murphy the judge ruled monetary damages in 
the 5 million lawsuit were not decided but the judge disallowed 
any punitive award 
paramount promised an appeal while writers predicted their 
battles would be a bit easier against hollywood studios 
i am delighted that the little man kicked the big guy said 
billy wilder a buchwald ally and the director and cowriter of 
paramounts 1950 classic sunset boulevard 
its a very important decision for all writers said david 
rintels an awardwinning screenwriter day one sakharov 
who served as an expert witness on buchwalds behalf it upholds 
the sanctity of contracts and it affirms that a writers original 
ideas have value 
buchwalds story like 1988s coming to america was about a 
member of african royalty who comes to the united states lives in 
a ghetto works at a fastfood restaurant and finds a bride to take 
home to his native land 
the pulitzer prizewinning columnist filed the lawsuit last 
year alleging the studio breached a 1983 contract to purchase his 
script idea 
buchwalds attorney pierce odonnell said that his client and 
buchwalds writing partner producer alain bernheim stood to 
receive between 5 million and 10 million 
the judges decision allows an inspection of paramounts 
financial records on the movie odonnell said paramount claims 
the film which has gross profits of more than 300 million has no 
net profits 
if you believe that buchwald quipped then theres a 
wonderful sampl id like to sell you 
paramount meanwhile began preparing for another round in court 
we dont agree with the judges decision on the contract 
claim however we are pleased he threw out the claim for punitive 
damages it said in a statement we are confident that the 
appellate court will find that coming to america was created 
without any contribution from art buchwald 
robert draper an attorney for paramount said buchwalds script 
idea and murphys movie were entirely different its like 
godzilla and cinderella 
the only similarity he said was that the main characters in 
each version were black 
draper said that the judges interpretation of the based 
upon concept a crucial point in the ruling was too broad 
under the interpretation of based upon that was adopted 
just about anything could be found to be based upon anything 
else draper said 
paramounts lawyers had said during the court proceedings that a 
ruling in favor of buchwald could trigger an onslaught of 
groundless lawsuits 
neither murphy nor his manager bob wachs responded to 
telephone messages for comment 
a spokeswoman for arsenio hall who developed the movie with 
murphy and costarred in it also did not respond to a telephone 
request for comment 
buchwald said his dispute was solely a breachofcontract claim 
against paramount and not an allegation of plagiarism against 
murphy 
buchwald also said the ordeal cured him of one ambition i 
have decided not to write any movies for the next 10 years

the us coastal areas from three miles to 12 
miles off shore are in a legal nevernever land that congress needs 
to clarify gov john waihee says 
he recommended monday that the adjacent state be given 
jurisdiction of the expanded coastal area along with the revenues 
that might be generated there 
waihee appeared before the us house committee on merchant 
marine and fisheries at the state capitol during a hearing on us 
oceans and coastal management issues in the pacific 
the committee is on an eightday trip to hawaii to examine 
fishing rights ocean mining and the territorial seas the 
itinerary is heavy on free time and evening receptions however 
but the representatives bristle at suggestions that the excursion 
is a political junket 
three panel members made the trip from washington dc joining 
two hawaii congressmen the hearing was to resume today 
waihee said monday that federal laws have established a 
reasonably effective statefederal management process for the 
coastal zone out to three miles 
those rules should be extended to the 12mile limit if the 
adjacent state territory or commonwealth agrees he said the 
governor recommended that states draw up plans to manage the new 
zone 
as for the nearly 1 billion in annual federal revenues from 
offshore oil and gas leases in the three to 12 mile zone waihee 
suggested that revenues from new production over the next 10 years 
be divided 5050 between federal and the adjacent state 
after the period he said the money should go the state upon 
completion of a management program 
hawaii has no offshore oil and gas leases but it does have 
mineralrich manganese crusts on seamounts near the islands

the us supreme courts refusal to ban 
eavesdropping of conversations on cordless telephones has 
implications for all phone users a civilliberties lawyer says 
the court without comment on monday let stand a ruling that 
scott county law enforcement agents acted lawfully when they 
monitored cordlessphone conversations by the scott tyler family of 
dixon without a warrant 
one of every four american homes has a cordless phone according 
to industry estimates but the ruling could affect people using 
standard cord telephones who knowingly or not talk with someone 
using a cordless phone said randall wilson of the iowa civil 
liberties union 
im sure the justices had some very good reasons for refusing 
to hear the case said wilson who helped represent tyler but 
for now it means that every american will have to live in fear that 
some of his or her phone calls will not be private 
i think the message for americans will continue to be that if 
you purchase modern conveniences such as cordless phones or baby 
monitors or other radio devices it means purchasing them at the 
expense of your constitutional rights 
tyler said he will refile the case before the high court in its 
next session beginning oct 1 wilson however was doubtful the 
court would take another look at the case 
tyler said he received a cordless phone as a fathers day gift 
in 1983 from his children whenever the phone was in use rich and 
sandra berodt who lived a few blocks away discovered their 
cordless phone would making ringing and dialing noises 
based on at least one phone conversation they listened to the 
berodts suspected tyler was involved in illegal drug dealing they 
contacted the county sheriffs department 
authorities encouraged the berodts to continue the eavesdropping 
and supplied them with recording equipment so conversations on the 
tylers phone could be taped 
the suspicion of drugdealing proved unfounded but over several 
months authorities relied on the tapes to charge tyler with 
criminal theft and conspiracy the tapes however were barred as 
evidence at his trial 
tyler was convicted in late 1984 on charges stemming from his 
bilking two food companies out of 35000 he was sentenced to 10 
years in prison but released after 123 days 
tyler and his family later sued the berodts scott county 
sheriff forest ashcraft and a sheriffs investigator contending 
the warrantless phone monitoring violated the familys fourth 
amendment privacy rights 
us district judge harold d vietor in davenport dismissed the 
lawsuit and the 8th us circuit court of appeals upheld the 
ruling which the supreme court let stand 
vietor had noted that the technology of cordless phones makes 
conversations on them more susceptible to interception because 
there was no justifiable expectation of privacy the interceptions 
did not violate the fourth amendment he ruled 
the amendment generally bars searches and seizures without 
warrants police have been barred since a landmark 1967 high court 
ruling from secretly listening to conversations over traditional 
phones without court warrants 
tyler who has waged a crusade over the eavesdropping issue 
said he wont put his campaign on hold 
i and millions of americans still believe this is just simply 
wrong 
as it now stands information gained from a cordless phone 
could be used diabolically by police agencies divorce lawyers 
banking institutions et cetera tyler said in a telephone 
interview on a standard cord phone

federal officials plan to move manuel noriega out 
of state for security reasons according to a published report 
today but his lawyers said they know nothing about such a move 
quoting an anonymous source involved in the shift the new york 
times reported that the deposed panamanian leader probably would be 
taken to the federal penitentiary in atlanta 
he was being held early today in a holding cell in the us 
courthouse here sources who spoke on condition of anonymity told 
the associated press 
us marshals and noriegas attorneys refuse to disclose his 
whereabouts 
up until now they us marshals have not intimated in any 
way that theyre going to remove him from miami defense attorney 
steven kollin said late monday 
however they have told us frankly that they may have to move 
him from the place where he is being held now to a more suitable 
place for their security purposes 
if this is not in the southern district of florida or not 
suitable so that we can have access for meetings with our client 
we will file the appropriate motions he told the ap 
another noriega attorney frank rubino also said he had not 
been informed of an imminent move both attorneys said they have 
met daily with their client 
federal officials believe the metropolitan correctional center 
a federal prison south of miami does not offer adequate security 
to hold noriega the times said 
officials considered federal prisons in leavenworth kan and 
marion ill but atlantas was first choice because it is closest 
to miami the newspaper reported 
rubino and kollin dont expect to make their first motions in 
the drugtrafficking case for 30 days but when they do they 
likely will challenge the courts jurisdiction the way noriega was 
brought to this country after us invasion of panama and requests 
for government documents 
an attorney for a pilot accused of flying drug money for 
noriega meanwhile asked for disclosure of secret information 
obtained from us electronic surveillance in panama 
the motion by michael okane representing panamanian pilot 
daniel miranda asked the court to compel release of classified 
information from a telecommunications monitoring operation at the 
us southern command 
the indictment charges that miranda flew 800000 in drug money 
from florida to panama in 1983 
lawyers for other codefendants said they have begun talks with 
prosecutors but no deals have been struck 
were desirous of exploring all options but no offers have 
been made on either side and there are no deals said samuel 
burstyn attorney for luis del cid a former close aide to noriega

more than half of an unprecedented number of dead 
manatees found in florida waterways during the past nine days may 
be victims of the christmas cold snap state officials said 
the carcasses of 41 of the endangered marine mammals have been 
discovered in the new year the states department of natural 
resources reported monday 
there were only 15 manatees found dead last year in all of 
january said dr bruce ackerman marine mammal researcher at the 
departments florida research institute 
its the worst winter dieoff weve had since weve been 
counting he said they are literally coming in so fast we 
cant keep our records up 
ackermans department has been documenting manatee deaths since 
1974 
most of the carcasses have been found in the waters off brevard 
county violet stewart an institute spokeswoman said 27 of the 
gentle sea cows have been found there 
it appears that the water over there got particularly cold 
she said we had some reports of water temperatures down into the 
40s 
she said marine biologists estimate that 25 to 30 of the deaths 
are coldrelated although precise causes will take time to 
determine 
they are finding that manatees died with this cold snap and 
they sank ms stewart said as they decay they rise to the 
surface so they are just now being recovered 
ackerman said that since manatees are tropical they have no 
layer of blubber like seals and whales 
they lose their ability to digest food and gradually become 
more rundown he said when they get rundown they lose the 
ability to swim to a warmer place 
last year there were a record 165 manatee deaths biologists 
estimate that florida has only 1200 of the endangered creatures 
left

president virgilio barco was assailed by 
the opposition and reported to have even angered his own foreign 
minister by backing a bush administration plan to station us 
warships off the coast in an attempt to snare drug traffickers 
news reports monday said foreign minister julio londono paredes 
planned to resign over the issue but colombias ambassador in 
washington victor mosquera chaux later said londono told him he 
was not quitting 
protests over the planned us operation were not unexpected 
because barcos 5monthold war with colombias powerful cocaine 
barons seen as courageous elsewhere has received relatively 
little support at home 
the issue is also sensitive after the us invasion of panama 
last month which drew criticism from colombians and other latin 
americans who are sensitive to washingtons use of military force 
in the region as an instrument of policy 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater traveling with president 
bush on a trip to orlando fla said two ships were on maneuvers 
in the atlantic but that future deployment near colombia would 
depend on talks with the barco government 
the carrier john f kennedy and guided missile cruiser virginia 
left thursday from norfolk va 
bush has looked at sending us warships off colombias 
caribbean coast to help monitor and interdict narcotics 
traffickers pentagon sources have said 
a diplomat with the us embassy said monday that barco had not 
sent a protest note or objected in any other way officially or 
unofficially to an increase of caribbean patrols the official 
asked to remain anonymous so he would not become a target of the 
cocaine gangs 
officials of both countries said monday that such an operation 
would not constitute a blockade 
the colombian embassy in washington issued a statement denying 
the united states sought to set up a blockade in colombias coastal 
waters and saying the bush administration gave assurances it will 
not interfere with colombianflagged ships even on the high seas 
without the permission of colombias defense ministry 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said a 
blockade would mean shutting down everything and that obviously 
is not our intention 
a us embassy statement last week said the navy patrols were 
merely an exercise in increased vigilance not a new policy and 
would take place in international waters 
adding to the confusion about colombias official position was a 
report sunday by the bogota daily el tiempo that barcos office 
issued a statement saying colombia would not contribute warships to 
the us effort 
julio carlos gonzalez a spokesman for barco said the el tiempo 
story was not based on any barco statement because none had been 
issued 
la prensa a bogota daily with access to presidential advisers 
said monday that the debate within the colombian government 
appearerd to stem from a dispute between president and foreign 
minister 
radio caracol quoting an unidentified highranking source in 
the government said londono was preparing his resignation monday 
afternoon mosquera chaux later denied the report speaking in an 
interview with radio caracol from washington 
monday was a holiday in colombia and government offices were not 
open for official comment 
there was also no immediate comment on what bearing possible 
us interdiction efforts could have on a regional drug summit is 
scheduled for feb 15 in cartagena colombia that is to be 
attended by bush 
protests to the possible stationing of us warships in the 
caribbean came from the opposition conservative party and the 
leftist patriotic union party neither has been supportive of 
barcos attempt to crush drug traffickers 
colombias congress should be called into emergency session to 
emphatically reject the air and sea maneuvers implemented by the 
united states the president of the conservative partys central 
committee rodrigo barraza said in a broadcast interview 
the interview was broadcast by the radio network caracol 
the patriotic unions presidential candidate for elections next 
may bernardo jaramillo ossa said in a caracol interview that the 
us action in the caribbean shows that colombia apparently is just 
a step away from a us invasion

jurors in the assault and conspiracy trial of 
reputed mob boss john gotti will be sequestered for the duration of 
the case 
state judge edward mclauglin told the first pool of 300 
prospective jurors brought monday into his courtroom he made the 
decision because he was responsible for the jurors wellbeing 
and comfort 
you are going to be guests of the state for the entire 
trial he said 
he said the trial will last about three weeks and will be in 
session monday through saturday he said the jury will be locked 
away in hotels for the rest of each day and on days the trial is 
not held 
mclaughlin said the defense would be given the jurors names but 
not the addresses of their homes or places of business 
assistant district attorney jeffrey schlanger had requested that 
the jurors names be kept confidential noting it took three trials 
to reach a verdict in 1988 in a federal racketeering and narcotics 
case involving gottis brother gene because jurors were accosted 
and intimidated 
about threefourths of the initial pool were excused when they 
said they were unable to sit on a sequestered jury for three weeks 
the remaining 77 were given questionnaires about their personal 
histories and opinions 
three more groups of 300 will be brought in as prospective 
jurors 
the judge said he planned to hold a hearing today on the 
admissibility of tape recordings of a conversation at rikers island 
between reputed gang members about the may 1986 shooting of john f 
oconnor vice president and business manager of the carpenters 
union local 608

if the deck isnt shuffled seven times you may 
be getting a raw deal 
two mathematicians one of whom also is a magician have 
discovered that it takes exactly seven ordinary shuffles to mix a 
deck of cards thoroughly 
fewer shuffles are not enough and more do not significantly 
improve the mix according to a story today in the new york times 
the research was conducted by magicianmathematician persi 
diaconis who is also a statistician at harvard university and his 
colleague dave bayer who is a mathematician and computer 
scientist at columbia university 
the two made the discovery after studying results from elaborate 
computer calculations and careful observations of card games 
it confirms the intuition of many gamblers bridge enthusiasts 
and casual players that most shuffling is inadequate 
most people shuffle just three or four times which diaconis 
says produces an order that is far from random 
casino gamblers and even bridge players often take advantage of 
the nonrandomness of insufficiently shuffled cards diaconis said 
by knowing what the deck looked like at the end of the last hand 
they can predict the distribution of the next hand 
diaconis said that the nonrandomness of insufficiently shuffled 
cards is so common that when computers were first introduced to mix 
cards at bridge tournaments nearly 20 years ago players were 
puzzled and outraged by the random hands the computers dealt 
by saying that the deck is perfectly mixed after seven shuffles 
the researchers mean that every arrangement of the 52 cards is 
equally likely or that any card is as likely to be in one place as 
in another 
the cards get more randomly mixed after seven shuffles but 
seven times is a transition point the first time randomness is 
close additional shuffles dont appreciably change things 
in las vegas casinos cards are shuffled from four to seven 
times at the discretion of casino owners said richard ingram a 
law vegas enforcement agent for the state gambling control board 
diaconis said his research showed that when dealers shuffle 
several decks of cards at once they need to shuffle more two 
decks should be shuffled nine times he said and six decks 12 
times 
at trump plaza in atlantic city nj blackjack dealers shuffle 
eight decks twice at the beginning of each game said howard 
dreitzer senior vice president of casino operations 
weve tested these shuffles and feel that they are random 
he said adding that no one has ever complained

the tokyo stock exchanges key index plunged below 
the 38000point mark today amid uncertainties over domestic 
politics and overseas developments and the dollar gained against 
the japanese yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues fell 34350 
points or 090 percent closing at 3795146 the lowest since 
dec 12 when the index closed at 3780353 
the index lost more than 500 points by midafternoon but 
rebounded somewhat as institutional investors picked up issues that 
had fallen earlier said takahiro makita a dealer with yamaichi 
securities co 
makita said investors were discouraged by rumors about a 
politicians possible arrest in an alleged insider trading case 
falling bond prices the weakening yen news about bombings in 
restive soviet azerbaijan and the 53 percent plunge in argentinas 
stock market monday when it reopened for the first time in more 
than a week 
a drop in future bond prices ignited fears of higher interest 
rates which discourage stock investment 
such discouraging elements sent japanese market players off to 
the sidelines and made trading inactive makita said 
volume on the first section was estimated at 500 million shares 
unchanged from the previous day 
to begin with the market has been unstable ahead of the 
election such nervous trading could occur repeatedly until then 
makita added 
elections for the lower house of parliament are expected in 
midfebruary although the government has made no official 
announcement 
with the insider trading rumor and soviet developments also 
affecting the yen the dollar closed at 14497 yen up 045 yen 
from mondays 14452yen finish despite central bank intervention 
to support the japanese currency the dollar opened at 14425 yen 
its low for the day and ranged as high as 14525 yen 
the dollar had gained 037 yen on monday 
todays gain also came despite a cut in the prime lending rate 
by major us banks lower interest rates tend to make a countrys 
currency less attractive to investors 
the yen is getting weak because nobody wants to buy it now 
said akio nakanishi a trader with daiwa bank 
the rumor came a little before the morning closing at 11 am 
9 pm est monday and market players sold the yen all at once 
he added 
i thought the rumor was a little bit strange but it really 
affected the market nakanishi said adding that investors felt 
the dollar was a safer investment tool 
the rumor concerned hiroshi mitsuzuka a former minister of 
international trade and industry said to be close to a company 
president who allegedly offered stocks in a transaction that 
brought a 828000 profit for an aide to former prime minister 
yasuhiro nakasone 
the bank of japan sold a few million dollars to support the yen 
and check the dollars rise nakanishi said

the federal aviation administration says it 
will revise safety requirements for infants and toddlers traveling 
on airliners 
faa administrator james busey said monday that the agencys 
eventual action which could be two years away may mean that 
adults traveling with children under age 2 will have to buy tickets 
for the youngsters and perhaps have them secured in faaapproved 
child seats 
current faa quidelines allow a child under age 2 to ride for 
free on an adults lap 
a representative of the association of flight attendants which 
strongly supports putting children under age 2 in some sort of 
restraints commented after buseys announcement that its 
ludicrous that there are faa regulations in place to restrain 
carryon baggage while babies are allowed to fly around the cabin 
during a crash 
if transportation secretary elizabeth dole approves the faa 
proposal to write rules for the airlines youngest passengers a 
formal notice will be printed in the federal register 
the public will then have 90 days to comment an faa spokesman

tens of thousands of ethnic turks who fled 
from bulgaria last year are not flocking back over the border 
despite the new bulgarian leaderships decision to restore rights 
for the minority group 
the relaxation of restrictions in bulgaria on the rights of 
the turkish minority may eventually affect the situation but we 
have seen no sign of it so far said unal erkan the governor of 
edirne a western border town 
some of the 320000 ethnic turks who streamed from bulgaria to 
turkey last summer have returned but most appear to be watching 
and waiting to see if bulgarias new reformminded communist 
leaders make good on their promise to end a forced assimilation 
campaign 
ethnic turks had to change their moslem names to slavic ones and 
were forbidden to speak turkish or practice islamic rites under 
meaures instituted six years ago by hardline communist leader 
todor zhivkov who was ousted in november 
the new government in sofia announced on dec 29 that it would 
rescind the policies affecting the 12millionstrong minority 
the action however has prompted protests and work stoppages in 
the country of 9 million the demonstrations have been led by 
members of bulgarias slavic majority suspicious of the loyalties 
of the ethnic turks 
the separation of turk and bulgarian and discrimination 
against us will never stop said fikret gocgeldi a 34yearold 
bus driver who took part in last summers exodus and now lives in 
edirne which lies near turkeys border with bulgaria and greece 
the kapikule border gate in edirne was nearly deserted with 
only a family of four waiting to depart it was a far cry from the 
scene last summer when cars packed with possessions jammed the 
border gate 
hundreds of thousands of ethnic turks streamed into turkey after 
the bulgarian government provided them with passports following 
bloody demonstrations for minority rights in may 
about 4000 people were entering turkey daily until the 
government in ankara imposed a visa requirement in august to stem 
the tide thousands of ethnic turks subsequently returned to their 
native land citing a lack of housing and jobs in turkey and 
separation from family members who had to wait a long time for 
visas 
by monday the returnees numbered 96500 border officials said 
but they added only about 100 were returning daily compared with 
a 1000 a month ago and about 50 ethnic turks were still coming in 
each day 
at the train station in edirne 20 ethnic turks most of them 
elderly were waiting for the train to bulgaria 
this is no place for older people i cannot enter any job i 
am only free to enter the mosque said kadir mehmet 60 
since last summer the immigrants have become settled in turkey 
in edirne the ethnic turks have been moved from tents to small 
prefabricated houses set up on a treeless windswept lot despite 
the harsh living conditions they appear determined to stay 
the rest of the immigrants have dispersed throughout turkey 
with about onefourth of the group settling in the western city of 
bursa and the secondlargest group going to istanbul 
most leaders of the immigrant community have expressed support 
publicly for the policies of the new bulgarian authorities 
apparently following the lead of the turkish government 
foreign minister mesut yilmaz has denounced the protest 
demonstrations in bulgaria but praised the countrys government for 
reiterating its promise to restore ethnic rights 
yilmaz has said turkey believes the demonstrations against the 
restoration of minority rights were prompted by local officials 
loyal to the ousted zhivkov regime he has expressed hope for their 
replacement

for former president reagan it was more 
than just another stop after another speech 
and for the children he met at the casa de los ninos crisis 
shelter it likely left an indelible impression 
one small girl remarked proudly ive seen him on tv before 
another child said meeting the former president was neat 
when one child asked him if being president had been fun reagan 
said the job wasnt invented just for having fun but i must say 
i enjoyed it when another asked him do you like us he 
replied if i didnt i wouldnt be here ive heard about you and 
now im here to see you 
and when the children proudly gave him notes and drawings they 
had made he responded with jelly beans for the kids and advice 
that he ate them instead of smoking and theyre a lot better for 
you than smoking 
sister kathleen clark the shelters founding director gave 
reagan a book about the nonsectarian nonprofit center 
established in 1973 that currently handles about 1000 children 
from infancy to age 11 each year 
reagan signed autographs for the children after being greeted by 
two sisters with a bouquet of daisies two other youngsters held up 
a banner to greet him one of the 9yearold michael fiscella 
admitted he was nervous 
but as he showed up about 15 people across the street from the 
shelter held signs and hurled criticism of the reagan and bush 
administrations policies in central america 
after touring the shelter monday reagan told reporters he was 
pleased panamanian dictator manuel antonio noriega is in american 
custody and will face trial in the united states 
but he declined further comment about the deposed panamanian 
general saying he did not want to harm chances for a fair trial or 
the case american prosecutors have against noriega 
as for the protesters reagan said im sorry that theyre so 
ignorant about that situation 
earlier the 79yearold former president delivered a private 
speech to a microcomputer trade group

the son of a former delaware prosecutor 
gambled away 651000 stolen in a philadelphia armored car heist 
and now wants to surrender according to published reports 
i stole the money because i thought i could quadruple it 
through gambling and then i would give half to the company i 
stole it from said a letter apparently written by edward leigh 
hunt jr a federal fugitive 
hunt was a guard on the armored truck that was robbed in january 
1988 
i used my gambling system but i lost it all said the 
letter postmarked in suburban inglewood and sent to the news 
journal in wilmington del 
were still looking for him an fbi official in los angeles 
said according to the los angeles times today 
the letter states that hunt wishes to surrender to authorities 
at the los angeles chamber of commerce on jan 20 the second 
anniversary of the robbery 
enclosed was a photograph showing a picture of a shaggyhaired 
hunt emerging from a swimming pool at a hotel or apartment 
federal agents who have been looking for hunt since the 1988 
robbery say theyre pretty sure the letter is legitimate 
as far as were concerned at this point they both look valid 
the letter and the photo said fbi agent john kundts in 
philadelphia 
people familiar with hunt identified the handwriting as his 
according to news journal editors 
i have a good story for your newspaper hunt wrote in his 
letter dated dec 20 
i am one of the most wanted criminals in the united states 
he said describing the crime for this crime i was featured 
twice on the national tv show americas most wanted 
the 26yearold said he planned to surrender because he missed 
his family and wanted to come clean he said he was sorry about the 
crime 
the fugitives father edward leigh hunt sr a deputy attorney 
general in delaware from 1973 to 1975 said he was sure the 
photograph was of his son 
police initially believed hunt had been abducted but he soon 
became the primary suspect 
a federal grand jury in philadelphia indicted hunt on april 26 
1988 on interstate theft 
absent any information to the contrary we would certainly 
intend to be there at the appointed hour kundts said of hunts 
apparent offer to surrender 
susan pasternak a spokeswoman at the los angeles area chamber 
of commerce said monday she had no idea why the fugitive would 
want to surrender there 
and the 20th is a saturday she said were normally closed

chinese leaders were preparing today to end 
martial law in tiananmen square the cradle of the crushed 
prodemocracy movement and possibly lift the restrictions 
elsewhere in the capital sources said 
the end of the 7monthold emergency would be mainly symbolic 
because troops already have been withdrawn from city streets 
it would not mean greater freedom of dissent because most 
activities banned under martial law such as antigovernment 
demonstrations and speeches are illegal under other laws 
however communist authorities hope it will reassure foreign 
governments and the world bank that stability has been restored and 
that soft loans should be restored the loans were frozen in june 
after troops cleared the city center of prodemocracy protesters 
killing hundreds of unarmed civilians 
authorities also hope that an end to martial law will reassure 
foreign tourists few of whom have come since martial law was 
imposed 
the action was to be announced at midnight 11 am est said 
chinese sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
it may be directed in particular at the united states where it 
would enable president bush to tell critics that his softening of 
sanctions against china had a positive effect 
a western diplomat in hong kong linked it to us national 
security advisor brent scowcrofts controversial december visit to 
beijing 
when premier li peng announced martial law in central beijing on 
may 20 for the first time in the 40year history of the peoples 
republic he said it was necessary to stem massive prodemocracy 
protests led by students 
however the protests were not halted until the army came into 
the city shooting on june 34 bent on dispersing students camped 
out in tiananmen a massize square that is the symbolic seat of 
power in china 
martial law forbids marches strikes class boycotts public 
speeches distributing pamphlets spreading rumors and other 
destructive activity it also gives soldiers and police 
authority to take any measures necessary to maintain order 
however a law passed in november outlaws all but progovernment 
demonstrations and authorizes security forces to stop illegal 
protests in addition the constitution prohibits disruption of 
the socialist system giving the government broad authority to 
curb any dissent 
chinese sources said the government canceled plans to lift 
martial law in december after the popular uprising in romania 
ousted hardline communist leader nicolae ceausescu 
students at several beijing campuses put up illegal posters 
ridiculing ceausescu and chinese leaders and tried to demonstrate 
on campus 
tens of thousands of soldiers were brought into beijing in 
response and were put on top alert they remained mostly out of 
sight in keeping with a gradual reduction of the military profile 
in the city since the summer 
on oct 31 authorities withdrew troops from key intersections 
and replaced them in tiananmen square with peoples armed police a 
special force that guards government installations 
soldiers remain billeted inside the museum of revolutionary 
history on the east side of the square and have been seen drilling 
inside the former imperial palace grounds north of the square they 
also remain camped in dozens of military compounds in and around 
the city 
plainclothes police also have been seen in greater numbers on 
campuses

during a threehour space walk cosmonauts at the

navigation system the official tass news agency said today 
cosmonauts alexander viktorenko and alexander serebrov were in 
good health after completing the mission early today tass said 
adding that installation of the two stellar transducers was a 
success 
radio moscow said the new sensors were required because of the 
docking last month of another research module that changed the 
configuration of the mir complex to an lshape that made a new 
orientation system necessary it said 
viktorenko and serebrov have been aboard the mir complex since 
september when they remanned it after it had been left empty for 
six months while new experiments were being prepared 
radio moscow said the cosmonauts have four more space walks on 
their schedule before they return to earth in midfebruary

khmer rouge guerrillas claimed today 
that they sent cambodias president and premier fleeing to vietnam 
with a grenade attack on the capital in which soldiers and 
policemen were killed 
the reported attack saturday would be the most serious in phnom 
penh largely spared in the 11yearold war between the guerrillas 
and the vietnameseinstalled government 
it could not be verified and some previous communist khmer rouge 
claims have proven exaggerated 
also today the noncommunist resistance forces of prince 
norodom sihanouk allies of the khmer rouge said their agents 
exploded a grenade a day in the capital between dec 5 and 10 
wounding 16 vietnamese and two cambodian policemen 
a statement said one attack occurred near premier hun sens 
house and others in front of the royal palace and the ministry of 
defense 
the governments spk news agency monitored in bangkok today 
did not mention any attack but stressed that sundays national day 
celebrations took place in total security it said saturday and 
monday also were peaceful 
national day marks the anniversary of the 1979 downfall of the 
khmer rouge which was driven out by invading vietnamese troops 
after a 3year reign of terror in which it tried to turn the 
country into a primitive agrarian commune killing hundreds of 
thousands of cambodians 
spk denied reports that a lack of security in the capital had 
forced hun sen to go to the eastern province of svay rieng to meet 
with australias deputy foreign secretary michael costello on 
sunday and monday 
the agency said hun sen was making an inspection tour of the 
province bordering vietnam and had invited costello to meet him 
there 
costello told reporters upon arriving in bangkok today that the 
meeting took place and was arranged for svay rieng well before 
the alleged khmer rouge attacks he could not confirm the attacks 
the guerrillas earlier had said they attacked and set ablaze 
cambodias secondlargest city battambang friday and saturday a 
western diplomat in thailand confirmed today that the town was 
attacked but said the effect was more psychological than 
strategic 
khmer rouge army radio said resistance forces had lobbed five 
grenades in the center of phnom penh near the office of the central 
committee of the communist party killing or wounding some 
vietnamese and lackey puppets 
it said the attack took place at 2 am saturday 
another khmer rouge army broadcast said the guerrillas aided by 
citizens and government officials attacked the capitals center 
and suburbs saturday with 32 grenades and tnt plastic explosives 
killing or wounding some vietnamese soldiers and puppets who were 
drinking near a hotel 
a number of vietnamese secret agents and puppet policemen 
were also killed by blasts from the grenades and plastic explosives 
in the suburbs it said the broadcast claimed vietnam 
immediately sent hun sen and president heng samrin as well as 
some other leaders to ho chi minh city 
the city formerly saigon is about 35 miles east of the border 
at svay rieng the broadcast said hun sen later went to svay rieng 
for his scheduled talks with costello 
the vietnamese dared not allow hun sen to see costello in 
phnom penh because of security reasons it said 
spk said monday that hun sen had agreed with australias 
proposal for a un role in an interim administration in cambodia 
before a general election but only if the un seat held by the 
guerrilla coalition is first vacated 
the khmer rouge fields about 30000 fighters and is the largest 
of three guerrilla groups in a resistance coalition 
fears of a possible return to power of the khmer rouge have 
increased as they have made major battlefield advances since 
vietnam in september made what it called the withdrawal of its last 
troops from cambodia 
the khmer rouge radio said the guerrillas would keep fighting 
and attacking the capital until an international authority verifies 
vietnams withdrawal and a coalition government including the heng 
samrin government and the three guerrilla groups is formed 
in paris on monday diplomatic sources said representatives of 
the un security councils five permanent members would meet there 
on jan 15 to consider ways to bring peace to cambodia 
the khmer rouge seized the rich gemmining town of pailin in 
western battambang province bordering thailand on oct 22 
they claimed they hit battambang town starting at midnight 
friday attacking military posts there and in banteay meanchey and 
western pursat province fighting still raged at dawn saturday 
said a guerrilla radio broadcast sunday 
in an interview broadcast over state radio sunday cambodias 
defense minister gen tea banh admitted that guerrillas are 
advancing in areas near the thai border and said his forces are 
abandoning some places to concentrate defenses in major towns and 
roads 
to be sincere we have lost some positions he said we 
cannot stay in every village we have to abandon some and keep some 
strategic ones 
he did not mention fighting in phnom penh or in battambang

leading japanese semiconductor makers said today 
that they plan 10 percent to 15 percent cuts in production of key 
1megabit memory chips because of falling prices and lower demand 
demand for 1megabit dynamic randomaccess memory chips or 
drams has fallen in recent months in large part because of 
stagnant sales of personal computers in the united states company 
officials said 
a 1megabit chip currently a mainstay of the computer industry 
can store about 1 million binary units of information the 
equivalent of about four newspaper pages 
an official at nec corp the worlds largest semiconductor 
maker said his company has decided to reduce production from 6 
million chips to about 5 million chips a month in the first quarter 
of this year 
with the price for a 1megabit dram falling from around 24 
last summer to 970 today nec has decided to downshift 
production he said 
although computer sales in japan have remained stronger than in 
the united states prices of 1megabit drams also have fallen here 
from 14 to about 1050 
the semiconductor industry is known for its sharp business 
cycles during a 198586 industry recession japanese makers 
suffering from overcapacity lost an estimated 4 billion and began 
a series of price cuts that led to charges of dumping overseas 
an oki electric official said his company plans to reduce its 
production of 1megabit drams this quarter from 35 million chips 
to fewer than 3 million chips a month 
hitachis production has fallen from 4 million chips to about 
38 million chips a month while mitsubishi electrics monthly 
production has fallen from about 5 million chips to between 4 
million and 45 million chips company officials said a hitachi 
official said further cuts were possible if the market continues to 
weaken 
fujitsu officials declined to comment on their production plans 
a toshiba corp official said production in the first quarter 
will fall from the current 9 million chips a month to below 8 
million chips but could pick up again in the second quarter in 
response to a resurgence in demand 
but the mitsubishi electric official who like the other 
officials spoke on condition of anonymity predicted that a 
recovery of the dram market would not occur until later possibly 
after the end of summer 
japan produced 85 percent of the worlds 1megabit dram chips in 
1988 according to dataquest a us research firm us firms 
accounted for 8 percent of production south korean companies 4 
percent and european makers 3 percent it said the figures do not 
include international business machines which produces memory 
chips mainly for its own use

military officials say a female captain 
praised for leading a unit into combat in panama was a halfmile 
away at the start of the fight but gave the critical orders and 
rushed to the scene when the firing began 
the los angeles times had published a saturday story that the 
army said news accounts of capt linda brays involvement in the 
battle at a panamanian defense forces kennel later repeated 
by white house spokesman marlin fitzwater were grossly 
exaggerated 
in an interview monday gen william mcclain said bray had been 
in her tactical command center directing her troops by radio and 
that she went to the scene as soon as she was aware fighting had 
broken out 
her job was to direct her forces and to accomplish her 
objective and thats what she did mcclain said if shes in 
radio contact and gave the order for the warning shot to be fired 
thats leading your troops 
brays involvement as commander of the 988th military police co 
got frontpage attention last week based on accounts from panama 
followed by fitzwaters praise at the white house president bush 
spoke friday of her heroic performance 
the incident prompted calls for the removal of restrictions on 
women in combat and rep patricia schroeder dcolo said she 
would propose legislation to that end 
various news accounts including one carried by the associated 
press quoted soldiers as saying bray had led her unit into battle 
storming the gates of the kennel in an armored jeep 
news accounts of the battles duration have ranged from a 
halfhour or so up to three hours an account of the incident 
released by the pentagon runs from 1 am until daylight but 
doesnt directly address the exact time of the firefight 
pentagon spokeswoman maj kathy wood made available a 
description of the mission involving bray which states that she 
ordered a warning shot to be fired 30 seconds after a 
spanishspeaking us officer announced over a loudspeaker that the 
occupants of the pdf barracks should surrender 
the captain then ordered machinegun fire against the side of 
the building away from its occupants and the pdf fired on the 
military police unit the account said 
after the spanishspeaking officer used the loudspeaker to bluff 
that the military police had artillery the pdf forces retreated 
from the building and continued to fire at the mps from a nearby 
wooded area the account said bray ordered flares to light the 
area and then ordered her officers to clear the area around the 
building it said 
the area was declared more secure at daylight and brays troops 
were ordered to pull back the account said 
at one point wood added bray ordered the driver of her armored 
jeep to run over the barracks gate so that she could get closer to 
her troops 
the times story said it was not clear how the inflated 
account of brays exploits began it said she was interviewed 
extensively by her superiors after questiosn were raised about the 
initial press accounts and denied being the source of the more 
elaborate reports of her units action

the chairman of the senate narcotics and 
terrorism subcommittee said today the bush administration used bad 
judgment in dispatching ships to colombia to fight drugs so soon 
after it invaded panama 
however sen john kerry dmass said he believes it is 
appropriate for the us navy to play a role off the colombian 
coast at the right time 
reacting to opposition from latin american nations the 
administration said monday is it postponing plans to position ships 
off the colombian coast 
now its on hold and i think thats appropriate kerry said 
on the cbs this morning show i think clearly the 
administration made a mistake in moving unilaterally and i think 
also the timing immediately postpanama was difficult 
he said is was very complicated from the standpoint of 
internal colombian politics for the united states to be making such 
moves at the present time 
on the other hand i dont think its inappropriate for the 
united states to seek to implement better surveillance of flights 
and of traffic within the region said kerry i just think the 
process has to be worked out more effectively 
the aircraft carrier uss john f kennedy and the cruiser uss 
virginia maneuvered in the atlantic off the florida coast monday in 
a visible symbol of the diplomatic circling occurring in washington 
and bogota 
administration officials said their future deployment near 
colombia would depend on talks with that countrys government 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the 
administration was still considering use of the navy to combat drug 
shipping but she said a blockade is not among the options 
a blockade would mean shutting down everything and that 
obviously is not our intention she said 
colombian officials had accused the united states of moving 
toward a naval and air blockade over the weekend after reports that 
the carrier group had left port and was preparing to take part in 
seabased actions against drug trafficking 
but a statement issued monday by the colombian embassy said the 
united states had said it would not interfere with colombian flag 
ships even on the high seas without the permission of colombian 
defense ministry 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater traveling with 
president bush on a trip to orlando fla said no agreement had 
been reached in preliminary discussions and praised the colombian 
government for its cooperation on earlier occasions 
meanwhile pentagon spokesman pete williams said defense 
secretary dick cheney plans to unveil the administrations plans 
for military involvement in the antidrug battle next week 
in denver cheney told reporters that although us laws limit 
the role the military can play in drug enforcement in this country 
we do have the capability to help identify drug traffickers 
trying to smuggle drugs to the united states 
cheney said that us ships can interdict vessels suspected of 
carrying drugs from latin america in international waters but that 
the united states will not take naval action without the 
cooperation of other nations in the region

all federal affirmative action programs from 
education to employment could be affected as the supreme court 
studies special preferences given to tv and radio stations owned by 
women and minorities 
we can count heads at the supreme court and were confident 
these fcc policies will fall said alan shurberg a computer 
consultant involved in one of two cases the court accepted for 
review monday 
government will be left with a colorblind standard shurberg 
said 
the justices said they would use a florida case to review the 
federal communications commissions policy of treating ownership by 
women and minorities as a favorable factor when awarding licenses 
the court also voted to review in a connecticut case the 
commissions policy of allowing any station facing a license 
revocation to sell its license at a reduced price to a 
minorityowned company 
different threejudge panels of the us circuit court of 
appeals here upheld the licensing preferences policy but struck 
down the socalled distress sale program 
those of us concerned about diversity in society are concerned 
about what the court may do with these cases said andrew jay 
schwartzman of the washingtonbased media access project 
the courts decisions he said could be worded broadly enough 
to affect government programs beyond the broadcasting industry 
but exploring the importance of minority ownership in the mass 
media and the significant role diversity in the media plays is 
a good way for the court to review those issues he said 
shurberg of rocky hill conn said he hoped the high court 
would use the two cases to put an end to all affirmative action 
he said his confidence was boosted by recent supreme court 
decisions that have curtailed what steps governments may take to 
make up for past discriminatory practices 
decisions in the two cases are expected by july 
the federal government as have state and local governments for 
years has adopted numerous programs aimed at giving special help to 
members of groups traditionally made the targets of bias 
for example those companies doing business with the federal 
government must certify that they make goodfaith efforts to 
integrate their workforces 
another example is congress setting aside a fixed percentage of 
all federal public works contracts for minorityowned companies 
in other action the court 
agreed to decide in a minnesota case whether governors may 
withhold national guard troops the federal government wants to send 
on training missions in foreign countries 
refused in a case from new york to force a revival of the 
fairness doctrine under which the federal government could 
require radio and television stations to present all sides of 
controversial issues 
let stand a ruling in an iowa case that people have no 
constitutionally protected right of privacy in the conversations 
they have while using cordless telephones 
refused to reinstate a 94 million award won and then lost 
by the family of a texas woman whose husband hired her killer 
through an ad in soldier of fortune magazine 
agreed to decide in a case stemming from a 1972 idaho silver 
mine disaster that killed 91 people whether labor unions may be 
sued in state courts for failure to assure safe conditions

least 31 were injured today when hundreds of striking and 
nonstriking rail workers battled with clubs machetes and other 
weapons at a train station near johannesburg police said 
union spokesmen said they received reports of more than 20 
people killed and more than 60 injured the reports could not be 
confirmed 
bodies still lay in bloodsoaked train cars two hours after the 
clash rocks sticks and homemade weapons were strewn around the 
cars and the platform 
it was by far the worst incident of violence during the 10week 
strike by black workers against the whiteled governments 
transport company about 10 people have been killed in previous 
strikerelated incidents and several dozen railway cars have been 
destroyed in arson attacks 
the union accused nonstrikers of an unprovoked attack on 
strikers with clubs knives machetes and rocks

involved about 1000 black men still working for south african 
transport services who confronted about 800 strikers in germiston 
an industrial town southeast of johannesburg the strikers had 
arrived at the station by train on their way to a union meeting 
malherbe said police officers dispersed the combatants with tear 
gas after the battle raged 45 minutes the congress of south 
african trade unions a militant labor federation to which the 
strikers are affiliated said police should have intervened sooner

early stages of the battle probably were railway security guards 
not police

transport services in early november demanding their minimum 
monthly wage be increased from 225 to 560 the strikers also are

it would rehire half the fired workers and allow an arbitrator to 
determine if any others had been fired unfairly it has not offered 
a wage increase 
leon els chief spokesman for the transport company said the 
clash made it imperative that the union respond to managements 
latest proposals he said the company was taking steps at the 
worker level to prevent further clashes

prosecutors hope to limit evidence about 
robert t morris state of mind at the graduate students trial on 
charges of setting loose a worm program that crippled a 
national computer network 
opening arguments were to begin today in the federal court case 
the suspended cornell university student from arnold md is the 
first person brought to trial under the 1986 computer fraud and 
abuse act 
if convicted morris 24 faces up to five years in prison and a 
250000 fine 
prosecutors allege morris designed and set loose on nov 2 
1988 a program that replicated wildly immobilizing an estimated 
6000 computers linked to the internet research computer network 
including those at nasa and air force facilities 
before a jury was seated monday justice department lawyers 
filed a motion aimed at thwarting morris expected defense that he 
did not intend to paralyze the computer network 
the government asked us district judge howard munson to limit 
examination of witnesses on morris state of mind specifically 
whether he intended cause any loss or damage 
evidence that morris designed earlier versions of the computer 
virus which were not launched are relevant to the charges the 
government said 
the evidence of lack of intent to cause loss or lack of 
intent to prevent the authorized use of the victim computers 
however is simply not relevant to any issue in this case said 
the justice department papers 
defense attorney thomas guidoboni raised the intent question 
during a pretrial motion but munson rejected guidobonis argument 
that morris intentions were pertinent to the legality of the 
indictment 
morris who was a firstyear doctoral student in computer 
studies at cornell is the son of the chief scientist at the 
governments national computer security center in bethesda md 
a cornell commission concluded that morris was guilty of 
reckless disregard for creating the program although the panel 
found him responsible morris has never publicly admitted creating 
the worm or unleashing it

the los angeles times says it has tape 
recordings of the comments it quoted mayor marion barry making when 
he ridiculed jesse jackson and saying jackson dont wanna run 
nothing but his mouth 
assistant managing editor john brownwell denied in interviews 
monday that the newspapers reporter misquoted barry in a profile 
the times quoted barry in the sunday profile as saying jackson 
a former presidential candidate supported by barry and now a 
potential mayoral rival would become the laughingstock of 
america if he ran for mayor of washington 
but barry told reporters sunday after attending church i 
dont understand it i couldnt possibly have said what they said i 
said i dont talk like that 
brownwell told washingtons wjlatv that barry most certainly 
did make the comments and his newspaper reported them 
accurately brownwell said the reporter who wrote the story used 
a combination of notes she took while talking to the mayor 
brownell told the washington post that barry made the remarks 
while talking to the reporter at a local bar 
barry refused monday to elaborate on his earlier remarks and 
jackson declined to comment 
im in the process of reading the article he said i have 
not read it fully yet its a rather long article after i read it 
i will put together a very definitive reaction to it 
barry was quoted in the article as boasting he was 
invincible despite being linked to a series of scandals and 
predicting he will get at least 65 percent of the vote in the 
democratic mayoral primary this fall 
jackson who was supported by barry in his presidential 
campaigns moved from chicago to washington last year amid 
speculation he would run for mayor jackson has said he would not 
directly challenge barry but he has not flatly ruled out a mayoral 
bid and some of his remarks have been seen as suggesting barry 
should not run for reelection 
sharon pratt dixon former treasurer of the democratic national 
committee who is running against barry for mayor said the remarks 
demonstrated that barry is visibly agitated with jackson and 
that his judgment is not sound

east germanys ruling communists said today a 
rough election campaign may be ahead and called for a fairness 
agreement among political groups to keep the campaign clean 
the communists plagued by a wave of resignations have launched 
a virtual counteroffensive as they prepare for balloting may 6 
still in control of the nations media key meeting places and 
supplies of such essentials as paper the communists have been 
accused of unfairly exploiting their formidable power more than 
100000 people demonstrated against them monday night 
the communist party newspaper berliner zeitung reminded readers 
today that the various opposition groups are running for the first 
time and it claimed many candidates feel the need to virtually 
shove opponents out of the way 
all this leads to the fear that it could get especially rough 
in the coming weeks the berliner zeitung said in reference to 
the campaign 
the newspapers commentary said however that such rough going 
could be kept in check if all sides reach a fairness agreement 
specifying campaign conduct it did not elaborate 
experience shows that punches below the belt cant really be 
avoided through such an agreement but they can be kept to a 
tolerable amount berliner zeitung continued 
the communists are fighting for their political survival in east 
germany which is plagued by shortages of consumer goods and low 
worker morale more than 1000 east germans resettle in west 
germany each day joining the 340000 who reached the west last 
year alone 
east german communists also reacted angrily to west german 
television plans to beam election information programs into east 
germany the official party daily neues deutschland said that 
unlike the opposition parties the communists will probably by 
shunned by the west german news media armada 
opposition groups have accused the communists of trying to stir 
up public fears of a resurgence of rightist activity and use it 
against the opposition parties 
in west berlin meanwhile the head of west germanys extreme 
rightist republicans said today that the partys east german 
members plan to compete in the may election 
republican party chief franz schoenhuber a former nazi waffen 
ss soldier told a news conference he estimated the party could 
receive 10 percent of the vote 
the east german leadership has vowed to thwart any attempts by 
the republicans or other rightwing extremists to gain a foothold 
in the country 
more than 150000 people demonstrated monday night in nine 
cities to keep up pressure on the communists 
down with the sed protesters in the city of leipzig 
chanted using the initials of the communist party they also 
called for the ouster of gregor gysi who took over as party chief 
just one month ago 
east germans ousted hardline leader erich honecker in october 
in a peaceful popular revolt and have since kept up steady pressure 
on the communists to act on promises to build a multiparty 
democracy 
opposition groups in east berlin came close to breaking off 
talks with the communists on monday after the government refused to 
provide full details about whether the dreaded secret police have 
been disbanded 
opposition delegates ended the days talks an hour early 
demanding unanimously that the government submit a report about

a palestinian woman was stabbed to death in the 
occupied gaza strip and slogans that appeared on walls today 
accused her of collaborating with israel 
shops throughout the occupied territories were closed by a 
strike today to mark the start of the 26th month of the palestinian 
uprising against israeli rule 
a senior aide to prime minister yitzhak shamir said israel needs 
stronger us assurances that the palestine liberation organization 
will not be a partner in proposed israelipalestinian peace talks 
yossi benaharon directorgeneral of the prime ministers 
office also rejected the state departments call on israel to 
rescind its ban on travel abroad by nine proplo activists from the 
occupied territories including some believed involved in 
behindthescenes diplomatic efforts 
he said there was no connection between the travel bans and 
the peace process and said the palestinians were restricted because 
they violated security regulations which he did not specify 
arab reports said masked palestinians entered the home of zifra 
abu libda 36 late monday and stabbed her repeatedly they said 
slogans today on walls in her southern gaza town of rafah accused 
her of collaboration 
the army confirmed the death 
her death raised to 167 the number of palestinians killed by 
fellow arabs in the uprising most have been killed by proplo or 
moslem fundamentalist factions for collaboration or involvement in 
drugs or prostitution 
since the uprising began dec 8 1987 646 palestinians have 
been killed by israelis and 43 israelis have died in the violence 
at a government briefing benaharon said israel is somewhat 
uneasy that there is reticence on the part of the united states to 
say clearly that the plo will not be involved in the peace 
process 
benaharon said that until such us assurances were given 
there was no point in holding a meeting between us secretary of 
state james a baker iii and the foreign ministers of egypt and 
israel 
the meeting was to have been the next step in us peacemaking 
efforts in the middle east and was to clear the way for preliminary 
israelipalestinian talks possibly in cairo 
israel rejects all contact with the plo saying it is a terror 
organization 
also today the army said schools for about 320000 arab 
children would open in the west bank starting wednesday elementary 
and secondary schools will open sunday for about 180000 students 
in the gaza strip officials said 
the schools had been closed for a holiday break and the army 
resisted efforts by the united nations and other groups to resume 
classes earlier to make up for time lost last year during 
armymandated closures 
the army closed elementary schools and high schools in the west 
bank for much of the 198889 school year contending they were 
organizing points for the uprising

the american civil liberties union a longtime 
critic of random sweeps for guns in detroit schools now is pushing 
for locker searches when there is reason to believe a student has a 
weapon 
the local aclu planned to present its 13point proposal on 
steppedup security tonight to the detroit school board 
these arent all original ideas but together they constitute 
a comprehensive approach that can result in less violence and a 
better learning atmosphere said leonard l grossman president 
of the aclus metropolitan detroit branch 
the aclu has frequently been looked upon as a bunch of 
naysayers we want to be part of the solution as well as raising 
legitimate constitutional issues 
howard simon aclu executive director for michigan said 
endorsing locker searches to confiscate weapons does not contradict 
the groups stand against random weapons sweeps with metal 
detectors a tactic he said doesnt work 
thirtyone guns were confiscated from students between aug 28 
and nov 30 compared with 24 for the same period last year 
according to district figures 
simon said the district should intensify individual searches 
when school security officers have reasonable suspicion that a 
student has a weapon 
the aclu proposal was developed by a 42member task force that 
includes wayne county prosecutor john d ohair several judges 
educators and civic and social service leaders 
the proposal also calls for classroom lectures on government by 
legal experts internships in law offices alternative schools for 
students expelled for weapons possession expansion of a weapons 
tip hotline and establishment of a committee of students teachers 
administrators parents and community leaders to review 
disciplinary codes 
school board president lawrence c patrick jr said that current 
efforts to strengthen discipline are working but that he welcomed 
the aclu report

dawn steel who attained the highest 
executive post of any woman in hollywood history has resigned as 
president of columbia pictures saying her creative instincts were 
underused 
the departure of ms steel 43 had been widely anticipated 
since sony corp bought the studio in september and brought in 
peter guber and jon peters the producers of rain man and 
batman to run it 
ms steel who succeeded david puttnam in 1987 said monday that 
she will remain as a columbia consultant for several months but is 
looking forward to leaving a job she called a gilded cage 
as i seemed to go higher up in the hierarchy it became more 
administrative for me and i began to feel like i was selling used 
cars it wasnt a creative job for me anymore which it had been up 
until that point she said 
ms steel had been cut out of decisionmaking as guber and 
peters assembled their own executive team 
jeff sagansky president of columbias sister studio tristar 
pictures left in december to head the entertainment division of 
cbs 
columbia and tristar had a 16 percent share of the box office 
last year or third place up from seventh in 1988 when the studios

communist and opposition leaders today 
met with members of the slavic majority and turkish minority to try 
to end ethnic strife that has swept bulgaria 
wellinformed diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity 
said they heard todays closeddoor session was very heated 
the talks are aimed at settling a dispute that arose over the 
governments restoration of minority rights to ethnic turks they 
are expected to last through the week 
demonstrations against the dec 29 decision to restore minority 
rights erupted thursday and spread to at least eight cities 
including sofia and bulgafins secondlargest city plovdiv slav 
nationalists rallying in sofia shouted down government leaders 
sunday and demanded they resign 
with the decision the new bulgarian leadership sought to end a 
policy forcing the assimilation of mostly moslem ethnic turks into 
bulgarian culture the program changed turkish names into bulgarian 
names and denied turks the right to practice their customs and 
religion 
party chief and state council president petar mladenov who 
replaced ousted leader todor zhivkov on nov 10 defended the dec 
29 decision during a meeting monday with slav nationalists 
according to the bta news agency mladenov told leaders of the 
council for the defense of national interests that the forced 
assimilation moves affecting the moslem population were very 
grave errors 
mladenov reportedly told the meeting that one result of these 
errors has been bulgarias complete international isolation 
the only way to correct these errors and reestablish bulgarias 
international prestige is to restore the constitutional rights of 
all citizens he said 
leaders of the government independent labor movements ethnic 
turks and the turkish government have hinted that the nationalist 
unrest that started last week was likely fueled by local 
hardliners still loyal to zhivkov 
krasniu petkov a senior trade union official had called for 
all demonstrations and strikes to cease during this week of 
dialogue bta reported 
petkov said all participants in the talks monday at the national 
assembly supported the call 
the nationalists have expressed fear that their own culture will 
be overshadowed by the culture of the turks whose birthrate is 
growing while that of the slavs is declining 
about 15 million ethnic turks live in the nation of 9 million 
some of the 320000 ethnic turks who streamed from bulgaria to 
turkey last summer have returned but most appear to be watching 
and waiting to see if bulgarias new reformminded communist 
leaders make good on their promise to end the forced assimilation

gay activists demanding repeal of sodomy laws set 
up inflatable dolls on a brass bed and blocked traffic outside the 
capitol on the opening day of the 1990 legislature fiftynine 
people were arrested 
four lesbian couples who flung themselves onto the street and 
began amid traffic were among those arrested monday in the 
protest against georgias 156yearold sodomy statute 
about 50 pickets organized by the texasbased american family 
association held a quiet counterdemonstration across the street 
lesbian and gay activists across this country will go to 
courthouses statehouses and jailhouses to change the existing 
order sue hyde of the national gay and lesbian task force in 
washington told about 300 protesters 
ms hyde said activists would focus on seven states that go 
out of their way to criminalize gay and lesbian sex arkansas 
kansas missouri montana nevada tennessee and texas 
we make a particular demand today that the seven states 
not only repeal these odious statutes but also apologize to us for 
the unpardonable offense of defining us as a sexually criminal 
class of citizens she said 
the protesters also set up a brass bed with male and female 
inflatable dolls simulating one of the heterosexul and homosexual 
acts forbidden by georgia law 
organizers of the protest backed a repeal bill cosponsored by a

space shuttle columbia opened a new 
decade of spaceflight today as it rocketed into orbit on a daring 
10day mission to chase down and bring back a satellite as big as a 
bus before it falls to earth 
the 115ton winged spaceship lifted off with a crew of five at 
735 am riding a 700foot column of flame out over the atlantic 
on the start of the secondlongest shuttle flight yet 
skies were partly cloudy as tens of thousands watched the start 
just after dawn of the 33rd shuttle mission during which the 
astronauts will put a navy communications satellite inoorbit on 
wednesday and retrieve an 11ton orbiting science laboratory on 
friday 
i dont think ive ever seenpacleaner countdown and launch 
said richard truly administrator of the national aeronautics and 
space administration what a marvelous way to start the 1990s 
the mission is the first of 10 planned in 1990 as nasa continues 
its recovery from the challenger explosion that killed seven 
astronauty ao ryears ago this month 
once in orbit the astronauts set up their computers for flight 
unpacked equipment remov liftoff was three weeks behind schedule delayed 
last month by 
launch pad problems and on monday by lowlying clouds the launch 
was timed to put columbia on the orbital path followed by the 
satellite the astronauts are tracking 
commander dan brandenstein and pilot jim wetherbee will guide 
the shuttle throug series of intricate maneuvers to close in on 
their quarry which has been orbiting the earth nearly six years 
the satellite the lmf duration exposure facility is the size 
of a small school bus and is packed wa4wp57 experiments containing 
a wealth of scientifi and technological information from its long 
exposure to space 
once the satellite is caught mission specialist bonnie dunbar 
will reach out with the shuttles 50foot arm to snare the 
21400pound package which is 30 feet long and 14 feet in 
diameter and stow it in the shuttles cargo bay 
it will be like hunting a speck in the sky brandenstein 
said recently but nasa has plenty experience doing this type of 
rendezvous and jim and i have practiced it to perfection in the 
simulator 
the satellite is 202 miles up buvtmospheric drag has been 
pulling it to earth about half a mile each day if the satellite 
cant be retrieved it will fall into the atmosphere and burn up 
about march 9 its experiments lost forever 
once the satellite is captured brandenstein wetherbee dunbar 
and mission specialists marghn ivins and david low will concentratq 
on experiments with emphasis on materials processing and how the 
body adapts to weightlessness 
the mission is to be 10 hours shorter than the ninth shuttle 
flight in 1983 and is a stepping stone for even longer ones 
columbia is being modified to stay aloft 16 days starting with a 
1993 flightv 
scientists are eager to examine ldef to learn how various 
materials and systems withstood the long stay in orbit 
information that will help in designing a permanent space station 
and the star wars defense system 
ldef is a virtual treasure trove of science and technology 
information said william kinard chief scientist for the project 
scientists may reap a big bonus because the satellite has been 
in space five years longer than intended the satellite was to have 
been retrieved 10 months after a shuttle put it into orbit in 1984 
but scheduling problems and the 1986 challenger disaster delayed 
the retrieval 
the satellite car 
ies experiments on materials propulsion 
electronics optics and other areas they represent more than 200 
investigators 33 companies 21 universities 7 nasa centers and 
several foreign countries 
on board are 125 million tomato seeds that will be distributed 
to students from fifth grade through university level for research 
into such things as germination rates and genetic changes

the army corps of engineers today closed 238 
miles of the monongahela river for about 10 days to lower the water 
and remove one of at least 61 barges torn from their moorings by 
rushing ice new years day 
the closure will mean about 25 vessels a day carrying at least 
35000 tons of coal and gravel will be delayed or forced to find 
another route said corps spokeswoman nancy mullen 
crews on monday began draining 17 feet of water from the river 
between brownsville and greensboro upstream from pittsburgh said 
corps spokesman john reed once the river is low enough workers 
will try to free a sunken barge wedged under a floodgate at the 
maxwell locks and dam near brownsville 
its going to look more like a creek than a river a good size 
creek reed said monday 
the coast guard on monday continued its investigation into the 
runaway barges heavy rain and melting snow had raised the level of 
the river and sent chunks of ice rushing downriver one barge 
leaked as much as 10000 gallons of gasoline 
as of monday morning 31 submerged or partially submerged barges 
were close to the upstream side of the maxwell dam and two others 
were downstream mullen said 
salvage workers hired by the companies whose barges broke free 
will work to remove the remaining barges from the river reed said 
water companies in the affected stretch of river have been 
warned of the pending lowwater levels so they can store water and 
attach flexible hoses to their intake pipes that will reach the 
water 
reed said it is unlikely any water companies will run dry and 
that he is not aware of any conservation measures imposed on 
customers 
the corps expects to have a clear channel by next monday and 
will allow the water level to rise probably reopening the river 
jan 19 reed said 
the river was reopened early thursday after being closed by the 
coast guard for four days shortly after the breakaway

the angop report said zambian leader kenneth kaunda was 
attempting to set a new date for the summit which was scheduled 
wednesday in luanda angolas capital 
government officials in zaire earlier said mobutu felt more time 
was needed after angolan president jose eduardo dos santos 
presented an eightpoint plan for ending hostilities 
mobutu who had proposed ceasefire procedures and offered to 
serve as a mediator for peace postponed the summit in a message 
sent to dos santos angop reported 
in a new years day speech dos santos said mobutus peace plan 
omitted principals agreed to at a june meeting between the angolan 
leader and rebel chief jonas savimbi 
dos santos said mobutus proposed measures to verify a 
ceasefire were unsuited to guerrilla war conditions and said the 
zairean leaders role as mediator in the angolan conflict must be 
strictly defined 
dos santos offered a plan calling for integration of rebel 
forces into angolas army and recognition of the legitimacy of the 
present government but suggested free elections could be held in 
the oneparty marxist state within five years 
in a later interview dos santos said that although he foresaw 
individuals being allowed to run against government candidates in 
the election he opposed multiparty balloting 
rebels of the usbacked national union for the total 
independence of angola rejected dos santos proposal in a statement 
distributed in lisbon on monday 
the rebel statement called for an immediate ceasefire based on 
mobutus proposals and direct negotiations with the government 
leading to free multiparty elections 
the meeting with the presidents of angola congo gabon 
mozambique sao tome e principe zaire zambia and zimbabwe was 
first planned for december its second postponement came amid 
reports of heavy fighting in southeast angola

the supreme court today threw out part of a 
dallas ordinance aimed at cracking down on xrated moviehouses and 
other sexually oriented businesses 
by a 63 vote the court said the citys licensing ordinance 
violates the constitutions freespeech guarantees by creating a 
prior restraint 
another part of the ordinance however was upheld and some 
parts were not ruled on by the justices the court said the city 
may require licensing for motels that rent rooms for fewer than 10 
hours 
the invalidated licensing provisions required sexually oriented 
businesses to obtain a license issued by the city police chief who 
had broad discretion to deny one 
under the ordinance the chief did not have to issue a license 
until a sexually oriented business had its premises approved by the 
health department fire department and building officials 
writing the courts main opinion justice sandra day oconnor 
said where the licensor has unlimited time within which to issue 
a license the risk of arbitrary suppression is as great as the 
provision of unbridled discretion 
a scheme that fails to set reasonable time limits on the 
decisonmaker she said creates the risk of indefinitely 
suppressing permissible speech 
oconnor said some businesses regulated by the licensing 
ordinance such as escort agencies and sexual encounter groups 
are not protected by the freespeech protections of the 
constitutions first amendment but she added it largely targets 
businesses purveying sexually explicit speech which the city 
concedes are protected 
the courts vote was splintered with different alignments on 
each part of the ordinance on the licensing requirement oconnor 
was joined by justices anthony m kennedy john paul stevens 
william j brennan thurgood marshall and harry a blackmun 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices byron r white 
and antonin scalia voted to uphold the licensing requirement 
the court upheld the motellicensing part of the ordinance and 
said none of the ordinances challengers had the proper legal 
standing to attack a provision barring licenses for people who 
reside with someone who had such a license revoked or denied 
the justices also said the challengers lacked the standing to 
attack provisions requiring suspensions of licenses for people 
convicted of certain crimes 
the ordinance also imposes strict zoning regulations on sexually 
oriented businesses but the court previously turned away 
challenges to those regulations 
today the justices told the 5th us circuit court of appeals 
to decide whether the invalidated licensing provisions of the 
ordinance can be separated from the remaining regulations or 
whether the entire ordinance must be ruled unenforceable because of 
those licensing provisions 
the case is fwpbs vs dallas 882012

the northwest airlines jet that lost one of 
its three engines over florida last week had a recent history of 
maintenance problems with its lavatory federal aviation officials 
said today 
the lavatory of northwest flight 5 a boeing 727 had been 
repaired 10 times since early november said dick stafford a 
spokesman for the federal aviation administration 
an unidentified faa official told the new york times which 
disclosed the situation in todays editions that the number of 
repairs was unusual it probably shouldnt have occurred this 
many times the source was quoted as saying 
a northwest spokesman was not immediately available today for 
comment the companys public affairs office said today in the 
times account spokesman doug miller disputed the figure saying 
there were only five or six repairs in the last six months 
the national transportation safety board has yet to rule on the 
cause of the accident 35000 feet in the air but there are signs 
that the blue flushing fluid leaking from a valve in the planes 
lavatory was responsible 
officials theorize that the liquid may have frozen at higher 
altitudes broken free and been hurled into the engine of the 
miamitominneapolis flight the liquid would have caused the 
engine to vibrate and break off they theorize since the 727 
engines are supposed to break free to avoid damaging the frame when 
they vibrate badly 
ntsb field inspector andrew alston was in atlanta today to 
examine the engine and the lavatory miami regional director george 
prellezo said by telephone 
ntsb spokesman ted lopatkiewicz said today in washington we 
intend to dismantle that lavatory tank what see what the problem is 
and talk to the people who repaired it last 
prellezo said the investigation was very simple and findings 
indicate that the problem is limited we dont have a problem 
with all the airplanes he said 
as recently as 1985 engines broke off boeing 727s in flight 
and in each case the problem was traced to a leaking lavatory as a 
result the faa in 1986 ordered airlines to inspect lavatory valves 
in 727s every 200 flight hours or replace them with sturdier valves 
newer 727s have redesigned valves that are likely to leak a 
boeing co spokesman told the times 
despite the concern with lavatory leaks the faas stafford said 
there were no records to indicate whether the record of repairs on 
flight 5 was unusual 
stafford said it was too early to determine whether any fines 
might be in order

welcomed democratic reforms in eastern europe and better eastwest 
relations but warned of the soviet unions continuing military 
might 
chancellor helmut kohl welcoming kaifu on his first visit to 
west germany urged japan to lower trade barriers 
at a luncheon speech in bonn kohl said japan must further 
improve perceptibly its market access for west german business in 
order to boost trade to a level commensurate with the high 
standard of development of the two economies 
japan in recent years has been embroiled in several trade 
disputes with the united states and the european economic 
community of which west germany is the most powerful member 
in a speech later in west berlin kaifu called the desire for 
uniting germany legitimate and indicated he would not oppose 
such a move 
kaifu on a european tour that will include visits to hungary

the supreme court ruled today that colleges 
and universities enjoy no special privilege to withhold 
confidential data from faculty members who claim they illegally 
were denied tenure 
the court unanimously rejected university of pennsylvania 
arguments that academic freedom confers a privilege of 
confidentiality for peer review records sought by a faculty member 
who sued when denied tenure or a lifetime appointment 
the controversy had drawn the attention of numerous 
universities the university of pennyslvanias appeal had been 
supported by princeton brown stanford harvard and yale all told 
the court that forcing universities to reveal confidential 
statements about professors being considered for tenure would 
inhibit candor by those doing the evaluating 
writing for the court justice harry a blackmun said past court 
rulings extending constitutional protection for socalled academic 
freedom only applied to government attempts to control or direct 
the content of speech engaged in by a university 
the court refused to recognize what blackmun called an 
expanded right of academic freedom to protect confidential peer 
review materials from disclosure 
the decision also rejected arguments by the universitys 
officials that federal rules of evidence provide such a privilege 
of confidentiality 
in other action the court 
threw out part of a dallas ordinance aimed at cracking down on 
xrated moviehouses and other sexually oriented businesses 
by a 63 vote the court said the citys licensing ordinance 
violates the constitutions freespeech guarantees by creating a 
prior restraint 
another part of the ordinance however was upheld and some 
parts were not ruled on by the justices the court said the city 
may require licensing for motels that rent rooms for fewer than 10 
hours 
said utility companies dont have to pay income tax on 
deposits charged customers to insure payment of future bills in 
the process it handed the bush administration a 300 million 
setback 
the court unanimously ruled that an indiana electric utility 
indianapolis power and light co does not have to pay taxes when 
collecting such deposits 
the internal revenue service estimates that more than 150 such 
cases involving over 300 million in potential taxes are pending in 
lower courts or before the tax agency 
the tenure case began with a complaint by rosalie tung an 
associate professor of management at the university of 
pennsylvania after she was denied tenure at the universitys 
wharton school 
ms tung filed a complaint with the federal equal employment 
opportunity commission eeoc charging she was the victim of 
illegal discrimination against women and people of asian descent 
the eeoc subpoenaed the universitys confidential peer review 
records for ms tung and five male candidates considered for 
tenure but the university refused to provide the documents 
it said confidentiality is vital to peer review which in turn 
is a critical component of the schools academic freedom 
university officials argued in favor of a balancing test 
approved by some federal appeals courts that would allow the 
school to keep the information secret unless it is shown to be 
essential to the claim being made by the faculty member who was 
denied tenure 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals in 1988 rejected that 
argument and its ruling was upheld today 
because we conclude that the eeoc subpoena process does not 
infringe any first amendment right enjoyed by the university the 
eeoc need not demonstrate any special justification as applied 
to tenure peer review materials in general or to the subpoena 
involved in this case blackmun wrote 
the case is university of pennsylvania vs eeoc 88493

divers searching for the revolver used in the 
wounding of charles stuart and the killing of his pregnant wife 
found a gun today in the river where stuarts brother said he 
dumped it police said 
it fits the description said police spokesman larry gillis 
hopefully a major piece of the puzzle has fallen into place 
police had searched for the gun since charles stuart 29 
committed suicide thursday stuart jumped from a boston harbor 
bridge after his brother matthew implicated him in the slaying of 
carol stuart whose premature baby died 17 days later 
investigators were expected to perform ballistics tests to see 
if is the murder weapon 
fbi agent jack decourcy said it is possible to detect 
fingerprints on a gun found in salt water depending on how long it 
was submerged how rusty it was and whether it was found in silt 
stuart who is white originally told police he and his wife 
were shot by a black mugger who forced his way into their car oct 
23 as they left a childbirth class police listening to stuarts 
pleas for help over his car phone found him and his dying wife by 
listening to their sirens over the phone 
matthew stuart 23 told authorities last week that he took mrs 
stuarts handbag which contained personal items and the gun from 
the scene of the shootings and threw the items separately into the 
pines river in revere 
police found the bag thursday but the gun had remained a 
missing clue in the effort to unravel the baffling and racially 
inflammatory case 
jay kakas coowner of the fur store where charles stuart 
worked told police a revolver was stolen from the shops safe a 
representative of the store who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said monday investigators refused to comment on that report and on 
rumors of insurance or a romantic relationship as motives 
matthew stuart also has refused to comment but his attorney 
john j perenyi said his client told family members and friends 
about the plot 
there wasnt a lot of support in the family for going to 
authorities perenyi said 
a brother of mrs stuart said he was appalled that the stuart 
family might have joined his family in grieving while keeping 
secret their knowledge of a murder scheme 
can you believe that they came to our house to comfort my 
parents that is just mind boggling that they could sit with us 
or allow us to visit chuck carl dimaiti carol stuarts brother 
told wlvitv 
dimaiti said his family believed charles was a victim until the 
shocking revelations about the case that followed his suicide 
it was such a convincing story and he was such a pitiful 
victim dimaiti said he had lost his wife he had lost his 
child they seemed to have a perfect relationship dimaiti said 
you know for us to cry over chuck to pray for chucks 
recovery knowing that chuck was responsible for what happened to 
carol its just unbelievable 
prosecutors meanwhile questioned another brother of charles 
stuart on monday as they continued to investigate who else knew 
about the killing 
michael stuart met with investigators from the district 
attorneys office his lawyer richard clayman declined to discuss 
the details of the questions but he added that his client broke no 
law 
clayman said he could not discuss what michael stuart told him 
but he noted i think its reasonable to conclude there was a 
terrible family dilemma that existed 
legal scholars say that under state law people who might have 
suspected charles stuart as the killer had no legal obligation to 
report that to police 
in massachusetts persons are criminally culpable for what 
they do for their acts not for what they know said frank 
chubert a professor of criminal justice at northeastern university 
prosecutors citing a continuing grand jury investigation 
declined to say whether more charges will be brought 
members of the black community who have denounced what they say 
was a racist investigation into the case met to discuss a proposed 
civilian panel to evaluate police conduct 
during the investigation police searched scores of black 
residences and identified at least two black suspects 
meanwhile stuarts casket has been placed in the ground at 
woodlawn cemetery in suburban everett where a memorial service was 
held for him saturday 
the grave covered with sheets of plywood and a canvas 
tarpaulin was marked only with a stick plot no 1443 written on 
it 
several plastic pots holding wilted red roses and white 
carnations lay on their sides

lawyers clashed before the supreme court today 
on whether public high school officials should have broad authority 
to exclude biblereading and other religious clubs from school 
facilities 
allen e daubman a lawyer for an omaha neb school system 
asked the court to limit the scope of a 1984 federal law requiring 
a public high school to permit meetings of student religious groups 
when it sanctions such other activities as chess and scuba diving 
clubs 
a broad interpretation of the law stifles the efforts of 
educators to structure a program that is relevant and provides 
benefits to the students daubman said 
but solicitor general kenneth w starr the bush 
administrations chief courtroom lawyer said daubmans position 
undermines the 1984 equal access act 
congress primary thrust was to protect religious liberty 
starr said its quite clear the purpose of the act was to 
eliminate discrimination against religious groups 
jay alan sekulow representing a group of students who tried to 
form a biblereading club at westside high school in omaha agreed 
the act would become a nullity by administrative fiat if the 
omaha school officials prevail sekulow said 
the court is expected to issue a ruling by july in the case 
hanging in the balance some school groups say is whether religion 
and prayer will return to public schools 
the justices challenged both sides to give a clearer explanation 
of when the federal law applies to religious clubs 
chief justice william h rehnquist said daubman seemed to be 
arguing for total discretion for school administrators 
he said the lawyers position allows any school district to 
totally avoid the act 
but starr in a legal brief submitted to the court before 
todays arguments said equal access for religious clubs does not 
violate the separation of church and state mandated by the 
constitutions establishment clause 
exclusion of religion and the message it conveys would 
iitself contravene the establishment clause by sending the clear 
message that the state favors irreligion starr said 
school officials barred the bible study group despite the 1984 
equal access act that says public high schools accepting federal 
aid must not discriminate against groups based on the religious 
political philosophical or other content of the speech at such 
meetings 
the act requires access for religious clubs if other 
noncurriculumrelated student groups are allowed to meet 
numerous religious educational and civic organizations have 
lined up on opposing sides 
the national school boards association for example said the 
aim of the 1984 law is to bring religion and prayer back to the 
public schools the association opposes the statute as 
unconstitutional 
but the campus crusade for christ said a voluntary student 
club in which ideas with religious content and significance will be 
spoken should not be discriminated against by school officials 
students at westside high sought in 1985 to organize a christian 
bible study club officials refused to approve it and suggested the 
students meet instead at a church next door 
the student group was led by bridget mergens now married and 
the mother of a 13monthold girl mrs mergens mayhew planned to 
be in court today to hear arguments in the case she triggered 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals last year overruled a 
federal judge and said the club must be allowed to meet on school 
premises 
the appeals court noted the high school has approved some 30 
other extracurricular organizations for such activities as chess 
scuba diving and community service 
the clubs meet on school grounds after class hours with a 
faculty member helping supervise 
the supreme court which banned organized prayer in public 
schools in 1962 and 1963 rulings said in 1981 that staterun 
universities cannot ban student groups from using campus facilities 
for religious worship and study 
the justices have never decided whether the same rule should 
apply to public high schools 
the 8th circuit court rejected the idea that high school 
students because they are more impressionable than college 
students should be given more protection from student religious 
groups that may appear to be sanctioned by school authorities 
the appeals court said congress considered the difference in 
the maturity level of secondary students and university students 
before passing the equal access act we accept congress 
factfinding 
the case is westside community schools vs mergens 881597

the supreme court handed the bush 
administration a 300 million setback today saying utility 
companies dont have to pay income tax on deposits charged 
customers to insure payment of future bills 
the court unanimously ruled that an indiana electric utility 
indianapolis power and light co does not have to pay taxes when 
collecting such deposits 
the internal revenue service estimates that more than 150 such 
cases involving over 300 million in potential taxes are pending in 
lower courts or before the tax agency 
writing for the court justice harry a blackmun said the 
deposits do not amount to advance payments for electric service 
and therefore are not income for tax purposes 
although indiana power and light does receive some economic 
benefit from the deposits he said ipls right to retain the 
money is contingent upon events outside its control 
that the utilitys customers when they qualify for refunds of 
deposits frequently choose to apply those refunds to future bills 
rather than taking repayment in cash does not mean that any 
customer has made an unspoken commitment to do so blackmun said 
the electric companys policy as amended in 1976 requires some 
customers to deposit up to twice their estimated monthly bills for 
electricity 
the company requires the deposits from new customers whose 
creditworthiness was in doubt and existing customers with a record 
of late payment of their bills 
the utility pays 6 percent annual interest on the deposits to 
customers if it holds the money for at least a year a deposit is 
refunded if the customer meets a credit test or if the customers 
bill is paid on time for nine straight months or for 10 out of 12 
months 
the us tax court and the 7th us circuit court of appeals 
ruled that the company need not pay taxes on the deposits and 
todays decision upheld those rulings 
justice department lawyers had argued that the 7th circuit court 
was wrong and noted that another federal appeals court the 11th 
circuit court had ruled the opposite way todays decision 
resolves that conflict in favor of the utility companies 
a deposit to secure the payment of future income is 
essentially indistinguishable from an advance payment for future 
goods or services and therefore is taxable as income upon 
receipt the justice department argued 
the case is commissioner irs vs indiana power and light

peanuts a bottle of after shave and matches that had accidentally 
ignited authorities said 
apparently due to friction they had rubbed together and some 
of the matches had ignited in the box and that had resulted in the 
smoke and the sulfur smell county spokesman mark kurea said 
last month a white federal judge in alabama and a black lawyer 
in georgia who worked for the naacp were killed by mail bombs a 
group calling itself americans for a competent federal judicial 
system claimed responsibility and threatened to assassinate two 
more naacp officials 
kruea said he knew of no threats against any county agencies but 
added were pleased that we took the precautions that we did 
given the circumstances and the history of actual bombing 
incidents 
the box had been taken outside the spartanburg county

for the first time in more than a century the 
share of blacks living in the south is increasing the census 
bureau reported tuesday 
the proportion of blacks living in the south grew from 522 
percent in 1980 to 559 percent in 1988 reversing a decline that 
had been under way for more than 100 years 
while the new census study did not investigate the reasons for 
this reversal two factors are likely involved according to census 
statistician claudette bennett 
one is that fewer blacks are leaving the south than in the past 
while the second is movement of blacks back into the region both in 
search of jobs and as part of the general movement of all types of 
americans into the sun belt states 
in recent years the employment growth that has taken place in 
the country has occurred disproportionately in the south noted 
william p ohare director of policy studies at the private 
population reference bureau 
blacks had traditionally been drawn out of the south by jobs in 
heavy industry in the north but most had maintained family and 
kinship ties in the southern states he commented such ties 
explained ohare make it easier to return south 
however the current trend is not exactly a return flow ohare 
said in a telephone interview 
historically blacks moved out of the rural south to urban 
north the flow now is to urban areas in the south not back to 
peoples rural roots he said 
while the share of blacks in the south grew by 37 percentage 
points between 1980 and 1988 the region with the largest loss was 
the northeast slipping from 186 percent to 165 percent of blacks 
the midwest dropped from 205 percent to 191 percent of blacks 
over the period while the west was nearly unchanged sliding from 
86 percent to 85 percent 
the 1880 national census found 904 percent of blacks living in 
the south and a century ago in 1890 that had slipped only slightly 
to 903 percent according to calculations based on historical 
records kept by the commerce department 
by the turn of the century the souths share of blacks had 
declined to 897 percent it has dropped steadily in this century 
as blacks moved out of the rural areas and smaller cities of the 
south in search of jobs in the northern and western industrial 
centers 
overall the new study concluded that there were 293 million 
blacks in the united states as of march 1988 up 136 percent since 
the 1980 census that represented 122 percent of all americans up 
from 117 percent in 1980 
the median age for blacks is 273 years compared to 331 years 
for whites that compares to median ages in 1980 of 248 for blacks 
and 308 for whites 
among blacks there were 88 males for every 100 females 
compared to 96 white males for every 100 white females 
the large differential among blacks may be related to the lower 
mortality rates for women and also to the fact that the census 
misses more black males than females in its counts the report said 
the percentage of blacks completing four years of high school 
increased from 75 percent of those aged 25 to 34 in 1980 to 80 
percent in 1988 by comparison the figure for whites held steady 
at 87 percent over that period 
despite the gain in high school graduates however the report 
found that the share of young blacks who had completed college 
increased only from 12 percent to 13 percent between 1980 and 1988 
black women were slightly more likely than whites to be in the 
labor force in 1988 58 percent to 564 percent for men 769 
percnt of whites and 71 percent of blacks were in the labor force 
the new census report does not include estimates of the black 
populations of individual states however the bureau defines the 
south as including alabama arkansas delaware district of 
columbia florida georgia kentucky louisiana maryland 
mississippi north carolina oklahoma south carolina tennessee 
texas virginia and west virginia 
here is a rundown of the percentage of blacks living in the 
south for each census since 1880

a us congressional 
delegation said tuesday that government reforms have failed to 
address black voting rights and us economic sanctions should 
remain in place or even be toughened 
the threemember group led by rep howard wolpe dmich 
acknowledged that there have been some positive developments 
since president fw de klerk assumed power in august 
the delegation which included rep alan wheat dmo and rep 
constance morella rmd cited the release of some political 
prisoners and government approval of opposition rallies 
but the delegation added we could find no evidence that the 
government has yet made any decision that it would in fact accept a 
democratic government elected by all the people 
de klerk says he wants to negotiate a new constitution that will 
bring blacks into the national government within five years 
however he opposes black majority rule and and envisions a 
mechanism that would give whites veto power on major policy 
decisions 
under the countrys apartheid policies south africas 5 million 
whites control the government and the economy and maintain separate 
schools and neighborhoods the 28 million blacks have no voice in 
national affairs 
the us delegation spent six days meeting opposition figures 
and government leaders including de klerk the americans said they 
would give him a reasonable time period to initiate 
fundamental reform 
they said such reforms must include the release of all political 
prisoners lifting bans on antiapartheid organizations removing 
soldiers from black townships lifting the 43monthold state of 
emergency and ending trials considered political 
the group said current sanctions should remain in place and they 
would push for tougher measures if de klerk does not move ahead 
with major reforms 
a 1986 us bill barred the importation in the united states of 
south african coal steel and agricultural products imposed 
banking restrictions and cut direct air links between the two 
countries 
wolpe is chairman of the foreign affairs subcommittee on africa 
and has pressed for sanctions against south africa 
the bush administration has indicated it will oppose any 
tightening of sanctions as long as de klerk appears to be moving 
toward reform

mount st helens trembled after its 
biggest outburst in four years and alaskas redoubt volcano shot 
steam and ash in its largest eruption since it reawakened a month 
ago forcing schools to close today 
despite mount st helens eruption and renewed earthquake 
activity scientists said they do not believe the volcano is 
entering a more explosive phase 
seismic levels rose monday at the washington volcano for 
unexplained reasons said chris jonientztrisler of the university 
of washington geophysics center 
foul weather kept scientists from flying into the crater by 
helicopter to take measurements gather ash samples and replace 
monitoring equipment lost in the volcanos ash burst saturday 
ash collected sunday was examined under a microscope and found 
to be pulverized rock from previous eruptions from the 8366foot 
peak rather than freshly erupted matter said dan dzurisin aciting 
scientist in charge of the cascades volcano observatory 
saturdays burst which was not preceded by earthquakes sent 
ash 90 miles to the east and destroyed two seismometers and two 
tilt meters in the crater 
jonientztrisler said earthquake signals saturday indicated the 
outburst might have resulted from groundwater reaching superheated 
rock beneath the volcano and turning to steam or from gas released 
by cooling molten rock 
the quakes monday small but sharp and occurring at an 
undetermined depth resemble some that were recorded last august 
but were never explained she said 
the latest quake pattern does not resemble any that preceded 
previous eruptions she said were not especially alarmed she 
said 
the latest eruption was the largest since a series of small 
explosions in 1986 on may 18 1980 a cataclysmic explosion from 
the volcano leveled 230 square miles killed 57 people and sent up 
an ash cloud that circled the globe 
in alaska on monday redoubt volcano hurled a plume of steam and 
ash almost eight miles into the air before activity subsided in the 
afternoon 
scientists said the patterns preceding the eruption were very 
different from previous blasts from the volcano 115 miles southwest 
of anchorage 
most of the ash was carried over the kenai peninsula and out 
over the gulf of alaska flights from anchorage to kenai and homer 
were canceled immediately other flights were canceled as darkness 
fell and the ash cloud spread over the gulf 
the ash plume missed for the most part the major population 
concentrations around kenai and homer but the grit was 
sufficiently heavy for officials to close schools today in kenai 
soldotna nikiski and sterling 
officials said they were concerned about the effect the ash 
might have on ventilation systems and didnt want students tracking 
ash into the buildings 
the fishing community of kasilof south of kenai was coated with 
a quarterinch of ash don rivers owner of a kasilof grocery said 
it was the heaviest ashfall there since the 10197foot peak sprang 
back to life dec 13 
people are pretty much just holing up said rivers people 
are starting to get used to it

the parents of a boy born with deformed 
feet have withdrawn an agreement to allow corrective surgery even 
if the county joins in a ceremony to relieve the family of 
responsibility for interfering with gods will 
they feel that even an agreement by way of a settlement would 
visit punishment on them because they would nevertheless be 
deciding to consent to the surgery theyd rather have the court 
order it done said rudy petilla a lawyer for the boys father 
i understand that if the kid himself strongly says i want 
it they would go ahead petilla said 
but 6yearold kou xiong has sided with his parents hmongs from 
the hill country of laos who argue that the fresno county social 
services department lawsuit to force the surgery violates their 
religious beliefs 
the hmongs believe that god intended the boy to have club feet 
and that the family would be punished for interfering with gods 
will 
ger xiong and his wife houa vue last week proposed a ceremony 
to direct any ill consequences of tampering with their sons feet 
at the agency insisting on the operation and not the family the 
ceremony would include burning incense slitting a hens throat and 
sprinkling its blood on ceremonial papers that would later be 
burned 
however the family changed their minds monday after speaking 
with religious advisers over the weekend petilla said 
the parents religious beliefs are genuine and they are here 
in the united states where their freedom of religion is 
guaranteed said ralph avila attorney for the boys mother 
lawyers for the family say they are not convinced that the 
surgery will improve the boys condition appreciably 
the surgery is an elective surgery its not a matter of life 
and death the childs not in immediate danger said petilla 
indicating that the surgery could be postponed at least several 
years with the same chance for success 
susan anderson a deputy district attorney representing the boy 
said she plans to petition the court to allow a child psychologist 
to evaluate how the boy would react to the surgery

two brothers who found an 80pound 
semiprecious gem could not agree on a way to sell it so they had 
it chopped up apparently seriously devaluing it 
i didnt want to see that big stone busted said dennis 
holden who found the gem with his brother ronald holden jr in 
october at a quarry they leased in buckfield i tried to stop him 
from getting it out of the bank 
dennis holden said his brother wanted to bring in partners 
ronald holden said setting up a corporation was the only way to 
properly market the gem which contained a single crystal measuring 
nearly 13 inches across and weighing about 115000 carats 
at the time of their find the brothers estimated the gem to be 
worth 1 million 
experts were reluctant to put a value on it although now that 
it has been chopped up stonecutter james mann said the brothers 
will be lucky to get 60000 mann said that this week he struck a 
deal to sell two pieces from dennis holdens share of the rock for 
16000 to a museum at harvard university 
state geologist woodrow thompson said the morganite crystal a 
transparent rosecolored variety of beryl should not have been 
cut 
i personally and many other people would have preferred that 
it be kept intact thompson said it was a splendid mineral 
specimen 
dubbed the rose of maine the gem was chopped up in early 
november at the home of paul bennett who owns the mine the holdens 
leased 
the holdens from the town of norway each kept chunks weighing 
about 17 pounds bennett got a 14pound piece as well as a 4pound

a roosting site for monarch 
butterflies may be lost to development in the community that calls 
itself butterfly town usa 
the city council has approved a rezoning plan for the privately 
owned property but voters will first be given a chance to decide 
whether their town 70 miles south of san francisco should buy the 
27acre site 
the property is one of only two winter butterfly roosting sites 
left in the city which celebrates the orange and black butterfly 
with a parade every october molesting a monarch is a crime that 
carries a 500 fine 
weve got to buy that piece of land said ro vaccaro 
president of the local friends of the monarchs we dont want to 
change our name to bulldozer town usa 
monarchs from across the west migrate annually to 100 to 200 
winter roosting sites dotting the pacific coast pacific groves 
two sites are the best known and monarchs have become the citys 
main tourist attraction 
this year the site slated for development attracted all the 
monarchs the other site in a city park failed to attract a 
single cluster 
on wednesday the city council voted 43 to allow property owner 
edna dively to divide the land into six lots as long as she gives 
the city 15 acres of prime monarch roosting habitat on the 
property 
no development can take place before voters are allowed to 
decide whether to buy the property the election could be in june 
or november 
council member bud nunn who voted against the plan fears the 
worst 
this development uses up some of the best part of the habitat 
and i dont think the butterflies are going to survive it he

nearly 80 percent of american workers surveyed 
for a poll released tuesday say prospective employers have tried to 
snoop into their personal lives by asking prying questions 
during job interviews 
the results demonstrate the need for tougher privacy laws such 
as tighter restrictions on how employers use information compiled 
by direct mail firms said linda golodner of the national consumers 
league which conducted the poll 
for instance technological advances allow all sorts of 
information from the type of beverages a person buys at a grocery 
store to their drug prescriptions to go into computers available 
to employers the group said 
the poll asked 1007 adults whether employers had a right to ask 
if a job applicant lives with a nonfamily member of the opposite 
sex has elderly parents about religious preference plans to have 
children smoking offthejob the nature of afterwork hobbies and 
marital status 
the poll which had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 
percentage points said 79 percent of the respondents had been 
asked at least one of those questions in a job interview 
in job interviews americans say employers routinely snoop 
into the privacy of job applicants by asking questions that have no 
relationship to job performance ms golodner said 
nearly two out of three respondents or 65 percent had been 
asked their marital status 46 percent their offthejob 
activities 23 percent their religious preference and 16 percent 
whether they smoked away from work 
an overwhelming majority of respondents considered most of the 
questions offlimits during interviews for example 87 percent 
thought it was inappropriate for an employer to ask whom they were 
living with and 74 percent didnt think it was an employers 
business whether they smoked away from the job 
only the question on marital status was considered by a majority 
52 percent as an appropriate question for an employer to ask 
more than 80 percent thought employers when making hiring and 
firing decisions should not consider outside activities such as 
gambling at a race track holding an unusual second job such as a 
bartender or participating in a political demonstration 
in addition the poll showed that 81 percent did not think a 
business should refuse to hire an overweight person and 76 percent 
thought the same rights belonged to smokers

us troops today surrounded the 
peruvian ambassadors residence where government officials said 
two of manuel antonio noriegas top associates one an alleged 
torturer had taken refuge 
an official of the peruvian embassy denied the men were inside 
the building 
they were identified as capt gonzalo gonzalez commander of the 
machos de monte company that provided security for noriegas 
headquarters and lt col luis cordova identified by noriegas 
foes as one of the men who interrogated and tortured prisoners of 
the overthrown regime 
the two were considered the mostwanted of the former noriega 
officials sought since the american invasion that ousted the 
military leader dec 20 
in a telephone interview today broadcast by a radio station in 
lima peru manuel tirado the third secretary at the embassy said 
a number of panamanians had taken refuge at the residence of the 
charge daffaires luis sandiga but he said neither gonzalez nor 
cordova was there 
tirado did not identify the panamanians in the residence or say 
how many were there 
president alan garcia of peru was one of the strongest critics 
of the us invasion which killed more than 300 us and 
panamanian soldiers the number of civilian deaths remains unclear 
after the invasion peru recalled its ambassador from washington 
and threatened to boycott a drug summit next month with president 
bush 
us troops surrounded the ambassadors residence in suburban el 
cangrejo near the downtown banking district at noon monday 
foreign minister julio linares said cordova was inside another 
government source said gonzalez was also inside along with noriega 
secretary marcela tason her son and another highranking former 
government official 
tirada refused comment on whether tason was inside 
linares said he would ask the peruvian mission and other 
embassies in panama for official confirmation and identification of 
noriega associates who had requested asylum 
a small detachment of american soldiers remained outside the 
embassy through the night 
noriega holed up in the vatican embassy for 10 days before 
surrendering to us troops jan 3 and being flown to miami for 
prosecution on charges of trafficking in colombian cocaine 
in developments monday 
the government said it was studying whether it would allow 
noriegas family safe passage to the dominican republic his wife 
felicidad three daughters and soninlaw a dominican have taken 
refuge in the cuban embassy 
linares said he had passed the request for safe conduct to the 
ministry of government and justice and if there is no complaint 
against them they will get consent 
first vice president ricardo arias calderon said the countrys 
security force would include specialized military units but that 
they would be limited to a few hundreds soldiers and not be big 
enough to threaten the government 
civilians in the government installed dec 20 in the early hours 
of the us invasion have tried to limit the size of any new 
security force to avoid danger of coups the armed forces ruled 
panama from 1968 until noriegas overthrow and have been an 
important political factor since panama was founded 
president guillermo endara sent a letter to president bush 
asking for financial aid to create 24000 new jobs and for loans to 
compensate businesses looted by rampaging crowds following the us 
invasion looters caused an estimated 15 billion in damage 
more than 600 members of the us 82nd airborne division left 
panama and returned to fort bragg nc in all about 26000 us 
troops took part in the invasion slightly more than double the 
number normally stationed in panama 
arias would not specify when further us troop withdrawals 
would occur but said he expected them to be gradual over the next 
few weeks 
the daily la prensa closed nearly two years ago by noriega 
resumed publication with an editorial that assailed the 
organization of american states for voting to deplore the us 
invasion 
it said the united states had freed panama from a barbarian 
corrupt and demented tyranny that would have led the country to 
total ruin with serious risk to the operation of the panama canal 
and to the political stability of other latin american countries 
arias said noriega followers were still at large and believed to 
be armed creating the danger of urban or other guerrilla activity 
we have confiscated more than 79000 weapons said arias 
who also is minister of government and justice there are 
indications there are more weapons stashed away 
we also do not know how the drugdealing mafia will react 
noriega had put the resources of this country at their disposal 
arias said the 11 pm to 5 am curfew would continue for now 
the curfew is enforced mostly by patrolling us military units 
accompanied by one or two members of the panamanian security force 
on sunday night more than 300 people were arrested for violating 
the curfew

students for the priesthood need to return 
to the basics learn greek and latin and study the teaching of the 
churchs earliest writers the vatican said tuesday 
the congregation for catholic education said seminaries and 
theological faculties should place greater emphasis on the study of 
the writers of the early centuries whose work is considered the 
basis of church doctrine and orthodoxy 
the writers who represent both eastern and western christian 
tradition are known as the fathers of the church and the study of 
their work is called patristics and patrology 
in a document titled instruction on the study of the fathers 
of the church in the formation of priests the vatican stressed 
that the ancient writings are still relevant 
theological reflection has always been clearly aware that 
there is something in the fathers which is unique irreplaceable 
and perenially valid it said in order for the church to 
continue growing it is necessary to know their doctrine and works 
thoroughly 
the document lamented that theologians often give scant 
attention to the early teachings which sometimes become caught 
up in an overall rejection of the past or taken over by the 
various fashionable philosophies and ideologies of the day 
theologians think that they are doing theology but are 
really only doing history sociology etc it said 
the document said many theology students dont know the 
classical languages necessary for studying the works of the 
fathers who wrote in latin and greek 
given the wellknown deficiencies in the humanities in todays 
schools everything possible will have to be done to strengthen the 
study of greek and latin in centers of priestly formation the 
document said 
the document offered some guidelines for teaching of pastristic 
studies saying it should be taught as a discipline in itself and 
not included in courses such as church history or ancient christian 
literature 
at a news conference archbishop jose saraiva martins secretary 
of the vatican congregation said the document coincides with next 
falls worldwide synod of bishops on the formation of priests 
after a long period of decline the number of roman catholics 
entering the priesthood religious orders and seminaries worldwide 
has picked up in recent years 
the number of ordinations of priests grew from 5918 in 1978 to 
7251 in 1987 according to the most recent report on the subject 
issued by the vatican 
the growth of vocations has been greatest in south america 
africa and asia although they have continued to decline in the 
united states

for the first time the day will be celebrated on a large scale 
in whiteruled south africa prodemocracy demonstrations around 
the world last year also have added impetus to the holiday by 
mirroring kings tactics and philosophy 
in kings hometown of atlanta center of yearly king week 
celebrations the 1990 federal holiday comes amid death threats 
that followed last months mail bombings of civil rights and 
judicial targets in three states 
with the klan and the mail bombs this year it has a more 
special meaning for everybody said state sen arthur langford 
who portrays king in a yearly production of langfords play life

learn to live together as brothers and sisters or we will perish 
together as fools he said

engineer lenwood clark watched 
tuesdays fiery liftoff of the space shuttle columbia looking 
forward to seeing the spacecraft bring down a project of his that 
is years overdue 
on friday the shuttle is to catch up with and retrieve the long 
duration exposure facility or ldef 
i spent seven or eight years working with the experiments 
prior to ldef being launched and having to wait almost six years 
for the recovery activity to finally occur has been interesting to 
say the least said clark a senior project engineer at nasas 
langley research center in hampton va 
the large satellite containing 57 selfcontained experiments 
was deployed by the crew of the space shuttle challenger on april 
7 1984 it was supposed to remain in orbit for less than a year 
to see how various materials react in space including tomato 
seeds but its retrieval was delayed because of scheduling changes 
and the 1986 challenger disaster 
the satellites orbit has been rapidly decaying and the 
21400pound structure will plunge back into the atmosphere and 
burn up in early march if not picked up by columbias astronauts 
if ldef is not recovered the loss would be tremendous said 
robert m walker director of the mcconnell center for the space 
sciences at washington university in st louis and coinvestigator 
on one of ldefs experiments 
walker clark and a host of scientists have long awaited ldefs 
return but they say the added time in space may have enhanced some 
experiments although others may have suffered some degradation 
from radiation micrometeoroids and other particles and vacuum 
scientists dont know what they may find because no other craft 
has ever been returned safely to earth after such long exposure to 
space 
we have 200 investigators in nine countries and those are the 
people that really built the experiments and are anxious to get 
them back in their labs and begin with the data analysis clark 
said those are really the ones that should be excited 
one of the major goals of ldef was to test materials for use in 
future spacecraft and the eventual construction of a space station 
the majority of the experiments relate to understanding the 
effects of various things in the environment of space materials 
coatings optics electronic devices all those things you 
typically build spacecraft out of 
that information is going to be extremely important in the 
design of future spacecraft especially those that are going to 
last for long periods of time clark said 
how do you design a facility that will survive the rigors of 
space for that period of time without some real information about 
those materials that are used in the construction clark asked 
columbias launch at 735 am tuesday was timed so that it 
could rendevous with the ldef on friday after 14 course 
corrections 
mission specialist bonnie dunbar will reach out with columbias 
50foot robot arm and snag the satellite 
about four hours will be spent photographing the exterior of the 
satellite and its experiments 
dunbar will then use the arm to tuck ldef into the cargo bay for 
its return trip to earth 
other experiments aboard ldef were designed to gather 
interstellar gas atoms and micrometeoroid material 
also on the satellite are 125 million tomato seeds which will 
be distributed to students from elementary school through the 
university level to be planted to see how living material is 
affected 
the numerous science experiments relate to the environments on 
living organisms and that relates to being able to live and work in 
space for long periods ot time clark said

the 80000 fund that figured in evan mechams 
downfall belongs to the state a judge ruled today buttressing the 
legislatures belief that the former governor misused public money 
in borrowing from the account 
superior court judge pro tem kenneth reeves iii said that the 
money became state property when it was delivered to the office of 
the governor and mecham cannot reclaim it the fund totals about 
100000 with penalties and interest 
i wasnt surprised but were very pleased said attorney 
general bob corbin it exonerates the legislature too 
in 1988 mecham was impeached by the house and convicted and 
removed from office in a senate trial on charges he misused public 
money from the fund in loaning 80000 to his auto dealership 
the firstterm republican contended the money belonged to him 
because it was raised to help meet campaign expenses at his senate 
trial he also was convicted of trying to obstruct an investigation 
of an alleged death threat against an aide 
mecham 65 was unavailable for comment a receptionist at his 
suburban glendale office said 
the state had argued that the fund made up of donations to 
mechams inauguration became public money when the inaugural 
committee chairman wrote a letter saying the funds would be 
transferred to the governors office for mechams ceremonial use

an outbreak of slavic nationalist protest 
against the turkish minority appears to be an attempt by communist 
hardliners to preserve their power in bulgaria an opposition 
leader said tuesday 
its an organized process from lower and middle levels of 
the communist party and even some people at the top said 
petko simeonov a leader of the opposition club for glasnost and 
democracy 
thousands of nationalists in the past week have staged strikes 
and demonstrations in at least eight cities across bulgaria to 
protest a dec 29 decision by central authorities to restore 
cultural and religious rights to the countrys estimated 15 
million moslems mostly ethnic turks 
for years ethnic turks were subjected to a harsh assimilation 
policy under which they were forced to adopt bulgarian names and to 
speak bulgarian 
when former leader todor zhivkov was ousted nov 10 he was 
succeeded by petar mladenov who promised to steer bulgaria out of 
its stalinist past and into a democratic future 
however the outburst of antiturk sentiment is embarrassing 
mladenovs government and could upset the talks planned for jan 16 
between the communists and the opposition on reforms and the free 
elections mladenov promised by may 
the protests could push the country in a neofascist and 
nationalist direction said simeonov this problem could deform 
the democratic processes in bulgaria and postpone the talks 
the regional branch of the independent trade union podkrepa in 
southern haskovo and kardzhali where some of the most vehement 
ethnic protests occurred last week claims that local officials 
commandeered buses and cars megaphones and flags for the protests 
opposition leaders and western diplomats say the deep mistrust 
between nationalist slavs and ethnic turks has been fanned since 
the mid1980s by zhivkovs assimilation policy and by antiturkish 
propaganda 
konstantin trenchev a leader of the union of democratic forces 
an umbrella opposition group doubts the hardliners can retain 
lasting influence given the radical changes in eastern europe 
they cannot exist alone in the world isolated between east 
and west he said 
senior communist leaders opposition members representatives of 
the turkish minority and slav nationalists met tuesday to try to 
defuse the situation on monday they called for an end to further 
large protests or strikes and the tensions appear to have eased 
but the bitter hostility between slavs and ethnic turks is 
deeply ingrained and ready to flare up at the slightest 
provocation a few dozen antiturk demonstrators gathered again 
tuesday around the national assembly or parliament in sofia 
slavic resentment of turks has its roots in 500 years of rule by 
the ottoman empire bulgaria won its independence in 1877 but 
ethnic tensions persist 
a wave of unrest in may swept regions where most of the ethnic 
turks live when they protested assimilation and clashed with 
security forces according to officials seven people died 
diplomats say up to 30 may have been killed 
after that zhivkovs leadership began expelling local leaders 
of ethnic turks as many as 5000 were expelled and at least 
300000 more then emigrated to turkey fearful of more persecution 
western diplomats say about 90000 ethnic turks are believed to 
have returned but an estimated 310000 are waiting for a decision 
on their applications to emigrate 
in august turkey stopped the free flow of immigrants from 
bulgaria because it could not cope with the influx and it insists 
that newcomers have entry visas 
viktor orlinov an ethnic turk living in sofia said his family 
in southern bulgaria was among those ordered to leave this year 
my father died of a heart attack not long after he heard the 
news orlinov said 
he discounted what he said were slavic claims that moslem 
fundamentalism could emerge in bulgaria or ethnic turks could some 
day demand autonomy 
all we want is for our children to grow up in freedom he 
said we are for bulgaria for prosperity and we think this 
controversy can be overcome

almuajjis saudi arabia ap the oil ministers of saudi 
arabia and iraq on tuesday inaugurated a new pipeline that 
stretches nearly 1000 miles across the kingdom and will boost 
iraqs oil export capacity considerably 
hisham nazer of saudi arabia and his iraqi counterpart issam 
abdulrahim alchalabi inaugurated the ipsa2 pipeline after the 
completion dec 22 of the third and final berth at the red sea 
terminal at almuajjis 
ipsa2 runs parallel to ipsa1 which came on line in 1985 the 
27 billion 979mile network can carry 165 million barrels a day 
iraq also has a pipeline running through turkey with a capacity 
of 15 million barrels a day 
chalabi described the pipeline as an ideal example of the 
brotherly cooperation between saudi arabia and iraq not only for 
its technical and economic considerations but also for its 
strategic significance for iraq 
iraq is observing its production quota of 314 million barrels a 
day decreed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
but it is eager to increase its oil revenues which stand at 
about 125 billion a year to help meet its foreign debt payments 
and pay for reconstruction needed after the war with iran 
chalabi said in a recent interview that completion of the 
transsaudi pipelines would bring iraqs oil export capacity to 35 
million barrels daily 
the us engineering company brown and root prepared the basic 
design for the ipsa project

prosecutors trying the cocainetrafficking 
case against manuel antonio noriega will likely face a barrage of 
defense attacks on the credibility of government witnesses who once 
smuggled drugs 
a key prosecution witness against the deposed panamanian ruler 
is expected to be convicted drug smuggler floyd carlton caceres 
who is serving a nineyear sentence for drug trafficking 
the background of carlton and other witnesses likely to testify 
in noriegas miami trial illustrates the problem prosecutors will 
encounter when they ask jurors to accept the word of convicted 
criminals 
but legal experts say the problem is common to such cases 
where in the absence of wiretaps or testimony by undercover 
agents the only sources of information about a defendant are 
unsavory people who were part of a drug operation 
president bush and attorney general dick thornburgh have said 
the case against noriega is strong indicating a belief among 
federal prosecutors that their witnesses testimony will hold up in 
court 
defense lawyers will argue that the jury shouldnt believe 
testimony from disreputable people that noriega was part of a drug 
conspiracy 
the answer the government is going to give is who do you 
expect him to associate with said a former federal prosecutor 
who specialized in drug cases 
its not an insurmountable problem in fact its a typical 
problem said the former prosecutor who spoke on the condition 
of anonymity a major issue will be the ability of the government 
to corroborate the evidence from each of the witnesses 
carlton has testified before congress that he arranged for the 
medellin drug cartel to pay noriega 200000 for each planeload of 
cocaine that was protected as it was shipped through panama to the 
united states 
others who may testify are convicted money launderer ramon 
milian rodriguez and convicted smuggler steven m kalish both have 
testified about the protection noriega allegedly gave colombian 
drug lords including armoredcar transport of cash and the use of 
military airfields 
in addition prosecutors could conceivably call as witnesses any 
of the five arrested noriega codefendants who decide to plead 
guilty and in return for a reduced sentence testify against 
noriega 
an attorney for one of those codefendants luis del cid 
indicated monday that his client was considering becoming a 
government witness 
there was a very preliminary exchange of amenities where the 
possibility of some settlement was discussed defense attorney 
samuel burstyn said of discussions with federal prosecutors 
were desirous of exploring all options but no offers have 
been made on either side and there are no deals he said 
the indictment describes del cid who surrendered last month to 
invading us forces as an emissary and a courier of noriega to 
the drug cartel 
the indictment says del cid arranged the payment of money from 
the medellin cartel to noriega 
del cid presumably could corroborate carltons past testimony 
about one alleged payment of protection money that is described in 
the indictment 
the indictment says that at noriegas direction carlton 
delivered 200000 to del cid at the headquarters of the panamanian 
defense forces 
the indictment adds that payment was made to cover the price 
noriega and carlton agreed they would charge the colombian drug 
lords to protect the next shipment of cocaine through panama 
shortly after the purported payment was delivered to del cid 
carlton is alleged to have flown 400 kilograms of cocaine to a 
panamanian airstrip from the farm of medellin cartel leader pablo 
escobar gaviria 
another likely prosecution witness is jose blandon a former 
panamanian diplomat and onetime confidant of noriega who has told 
the senate and the grand jury that indicted noriega that the 
exruler took protection money 
blandon a political adviser to noriega who defected two years 
ago told a senate subcommittee that the panamanian dictator had 
claimed to have been paid as much as 7 million to look out for the 
interests of the medellin cartel in panama 
among other things he described an alleged dispute between the 
drug lords and noriega following a raid on a drugprocessing plant 
blandon said the dispute was mediated by cuban leader fidel castro 
blandon testified that noriega and castro met in 1984 after 
panamanian authorities arrested 23 colombians and lt col julian 
melo the secretary general of noriegas staff the raid occurred 
while noriega was in paris 
blandon said the outraged colombians claimed they had paid melo 
5 million to protect the plant 
at the meeting blandon said castro assured noriega there would 
be no retaliation by the drug lords soon after the meeting the 23 
colombians and melo were freed and 3 million plus equipment seized 
in the raid were returned blandon said 
blandons story has been denounced by castro and noriega as a 
lie 
blandon has not been accused by federal prosecutors of 
involvement in drug trafficking his miami attorney atlee wampler 
dismissed attempts by defense lawyers in public statements to 
question blandons reliability 
blandon attended some key meetings as noriegas de facto 
secretary of state but he had absolutely no involvement in any 
shape with drug trafficking wampler said he was never 
involved thats why defense lawyers want to discredit him

rebellious soldiers will launch a 
coup attempt within a few weeks unless president corazon aquino 
resigns or promises to close us military bases here a man 
claiming to speak for the rebels said tuesday 
there was no comment from the presidential staff to the threat 
made in a telephone call to the associated press 
earlier mrs aquino said the collapse of communist governments 
in eastern europe indicated it was time to consider alternative 
uses for the six military installations in the philippines 
a caller claiming to represent the reform the armed forces 
movementsoldiers of the filipino people claimed a new coup attempt 
was imminent unless mrs aquino accepted rebel demands 
we will do so within the next few weeks unless the 
governorgeneral mrs aquino steps down or declares a 
unilateral statement that the us bases will be terminated if 
those bases are not terminated within the next few weeks then we 
will complete the unfinished revolution said the caller who 
refused to give his name 
if she does not step down we have no choice we will 
launch not just another coup but we will keep on launching 
them he added 
the caller asked the us government to refrain from extending 
military support to aquino forces in the event of another assault 
us f4 phantom jets provided air cover to government troops 
during the dec 19 coup attempt which killed at least 113 people 
it is the us government responsibility if it chooses to 
stick its finger where it does not belong this is a fight between 
the filipino people and the ruling elite the caller said 
the december attack was the sixth and most serious attempt to 
overthrow mrs aquino since she came to power in february 1986 
the justice department recommended tuesday that rebellion 
charges be filed against cagayan provincial gov rodolfo aguinaldo 
for his alleged support of the mutiny government prosecutors must 
decide whether to indict aguinaldo a former lieutenant colonel 
mrs aquino told a panel formed to study alternative uses for 
the six us military bases that the collapse of communist regimes 
in eastern europe and attempts at arms reduction by the superpowers 
indicated the philippines must consider civilian uses for the us 
bases 
but mrs aquino did not say whether she was in favor of phasing 
out the us military bases maintained under an agreement that 
expires in 1991 
us and filipino officials are expected to begin talks by march 
on extending the bases agreement any extension must be approved 
by twothirds of the 23member senate where opposition to the 
installations is strong

you live in florida and have been sending your 
tax returns to atlanta for years when for no reason youre 
supposed to file to fresno calif why 
the answer is that somebody goofed maybe 566000 times 
about one in 200 of the 107 million taxform packages mailed by 
the irs last month contained return envelopes with the wrong 
address irs spokesman steve pyrek said tuesday for example a 
taxpayer in maryland who normally would file to philadelphia 
might receive a package with an envelope carrying a cincinnati 
address pyrek explained 
the potential problem affects taxform kits identified with a 
package 1 notation on the bottom right corner of the cover the 
packages contain the basic long form 1040 plus schedules a for 
deductions and b for interest and dividends 
the folks at the irs are redfaced but say there is no reason 
for panic this shouldnt present a problem for the irs or for 
taxpayers pyrek said 
the irs has service centers in 10 cities page 5 of the package 
tells you where your return is supposed to be filed if that 
address does not match the one on your envelope pyrek said you 
may 
use another envelope writing in the address for your service 
center 
use the irs envelope but mark out the wrong address and the 
postal service bar code and write in the proper address 
use the irs envelope just as it came to you wrong address and 
all because relatively few envelopes with wrong addresses are 
involved pyrek said that will not upset irs workload schedules 
and will not delay processing of the return more importantly it 
will not delay any refund he added 
pyrek said the problem envelopes have been found in eight of the 
10 regions only the ogden utah center which processes returns 
from most of the west and the memphis tenn center which 
handles returns from alabama arkansas louisiana mississippi 
north carolina and tennessee have been exempt 
but that is subject to change the irs at first thought only 
seven regions were affected pyrek said but we just found out 
that somebody in delaware got an envelope with a fresno address 
the problem apparently originated with one of the many private 
printers the irs pays to print and bind taxreturn packages we 
think there was some kind of problem in the list the printer used 
to stuff the envelopes into the packages pyrek said its not 
clear to us yet 
the irs has heard of no taxpayer receiving the wrong envelope in 
the instructions for the simpler basic forms the 1040a and the 
1040ez 
but it is a rare year when the agency does not make some kind of 
mistake in writing and printing nearly 100 different individual tax 
forms and schedules and the dozens of publications that explain 
them 
already this year the irs has corrected a goof on form 2441 
which parents use to claim a credit for childcare expenses 
the form as mailed to taxpayers included a sentence on line 6 
reading if the result here is zero or less stop here you 
cannot claim the credit that sentence should read if the 
result is zero or less skip lines 7 through 11 enter zero on line 
12 and go to line 13

a yearend rush on movie theaters helped push 
1989s boxoffice figures to 502 billion smashing the 446 
billion record set the year before a trade industry newspaper 
reported tuesday 
domestic ticket sales for 1989 also hit a fiveyear high of 113 
billion a 4 percent jump over the 1988 total daily variety 
reported 
the year ended with a bang for the film industry with a record 
636 million grossed during the six weeks between thanksgiving and 
new years the gross for the last six weeks of 1988 was 605 
million 
the yearend record came despite a brief middecember slump that 
the newspaper said was attributable in part to christmas eve 
falling on a sunday 
last year was the 28th year that annual ticket sales have been 
essentially stable in a range around 105 billion daily variety 
said 
to some that may spell stagnation given population increases 
etc the newspaper said to others it signifies marvelous 
stability given the tremendous increase in audiovisual 
entertainment media

animal rights groups have no legal right to 
represent eight research monkeys seized in a 1981 raid on a 
maryland laboratory a government attorney argued before a federal 
appeals court tuesday 
mere interest is insufficient to make them anything more than 
a common bystander justice department attorney lowell sturgill 
told a threejudge panel of the 5th us circuit court of appeals 
he asked the 5th circuit to lift a district judges temporary 
restraining order forbidding the national institutes of health or 
tulane university which is caring for the monkeys at the delta 
primate research center in covington from killing three of the 
monkeys 
one of the monkeys is in such bad shape that attorneys will ask 
the court wednesday for permission to kill it immediately said 
sturgill his condition is deteriorating rapidly to the point 
that he may die at any time he said 
in response peggy woodward representing people for the ethical 
treatment of animals made an impassioned plea for the judges to 
leave the order it won intact and send the case back to district 
court for a trial about who should care for the monkeys 
underlying all their legal arguments is the unstated premise 
that we are science and they are antiscience she said 
in the name of science these monkeys were hideously 
mutilated senselessly needlessly unjustly said woodward 
we are not against science we are against that kind of conduct 
she said peta had more than an outsiders interest in the 
monkeys because nih which serves as the principal custodian of the 
animals and the animals owner the institute of behavioral 
resources had agreed not to kill them if peta would care for them 
she said they had reneged on that agreement 
peta was founded by alex pacheco whose report to authorities 
about the monkeys condition in 1981 prompted a police raid on the 
behavioral resources laboratory in silver spring md where 
pacheco then worked 
the animals were part of a study of stroke and spinal cord 
injury rehabilitation paid for by nih researchers had cut the 
sensory nerves to the left arms of seven of the monkeys and to both 
arms of one 
unable to feel pain the monkeys had bitten and otherwise 
injured their arms sometimes severely according to officials at 
delta regional primate research center where they were moved in 
1987 
researcher edward taub was convicted of six counts of cruelty to 
animals but five were reversed by a state appeals court the 
maryland supreme court overturned the sixth ruling that state law 
against cruelty to animals did not apply to research facilities 
sturgill said the 5th circuit should follow the maryland courts 
lead woodward said the current case deals with different law 
woodward said both the ibr and nih had written that the monkeys 
were of no use for any other studies after they were confiscated 
from the laboratory

shuttle columbia opened a new decade 
of space travel tuesday with a letterperfect launch and the start 
of a searchandrescue mission for a scientific satellite drifting 
back to earth 
after three weeks of delays the shuttle lifted off precisely on 
time just after dawn at 735 am and began chasing the satellite 
which was 1500 miles ahead of the shuttle 
i dont think ive ever seen a cleaner countdown and launch 
said richard truly administrator of the national aeronautics and 
space administration what a marvelous way to start the 1990s 
the flight begins a decade in which shuttles will transport 
astronauts and materials to build americas space station the 
station is an essential step for a return to the moon and 
expeditions to mars envisioned by president bush 
columbias mission is scheduled to last 10 days the 
secondlongest since shuttles began flying in 1981 the ship is 
being modified gradually for 16day journeys and the extended 
mission is to be a test toward that objective 
the 200milehigh pursuit is to end friday morning when 
commander dan brandenstein and his crew of four catch up with the 
bussize satellite called the long duration exposure facility it 
will take 14 course corrections to get them there 
the first of those in midafternoon edged columbia closer to 
the invisible path traveled by the satellite 
it was said mission controls brian welch like changing 
lanes on the freeway 
the crew meanwhile ran the shuttles remote crane through its 
paces and found it in good shape beamed some spectacular 
television pictures to the ground and activated two of eight 
experiments on their todo list there were a few small problems 
but none caused mission control any headaches 
columbia is a very clean machine welch said 
atmospheric drag has been pulling ldef to earth about half a 
mile a day a rate that is increasing nasa calculates that left 
undisturbed ldef would make a fiery death dive through the 
atmosphere about march 9 and its scientific experiments would be 
lost 
in a slightly lower orbit columbia was circling the globe a 
little faster gradually narrowing the distance with brandenstein 
and pilot jim wetherbee at the controls 
dan is one of the finest stick handlers weve seen and jim is 
not far behind said flight director al pennington in houston 
if all goes as planned mission specialist bonnie dunbar will 
snare the satellite with the shuttles robot crane on friday and 
lift it into the cargo bay for the trip home 
there is other work too for the five astronauts on wednesday 
they will release a 17000pound communications satellite to 
complete a set of four leased to the navy by their owner hughes 
communications 
tuesdays launch was the first in four years from pad 39a which 
had undergone a 50 million upgrading with two pads in operation 
nasa hopes to conduct a record nine more missions this year 
were off to a good mission im delighted said truly a 
former astronaut who returned to nasa as space flight director 
after the challenger disaster this was the eighth liftoff since 
that 1986 explosion and truly said i dont know how many flights 
well fly this decade but my objective is to fly them all like the 
last seven 
nasa had to scrub the launch on monday because of cloudy skies 
it was partly cloudy on tuesday but visibility was within nasas 
strict limits and tens of thousands watched from vantage points 
near the kennedy space center 
the ldef weighing 11 tons has been in orbit since it was 
released from the challenger cargo bay in 1984 by midday tuesday 
it had completed 32372 orbits of earth traveling more than 800 
million miles 
essentially the ldef is a 12sided frame holding 57 panels of 
experiments that have been exposed to space as a test of durability 
for use in constructing future spacecraft it was supposed to be in 
orbit for a year instead it stayed up for nearly six because of 
scheduling problems and the challenger accident 
brandenstein and wetherbee are guiding the shuttle through a 
series of intricate maneuvers to close in on their quarry 
it will be like hunting a speck in the sky brandenstein 
said in a recent interview but nasa has plenty experience doing 
this type of rendezvous and jim and i have practiced it to 
perfection in the simulator 
once the satellite is secure in the shuttle cargo bay 
brandenstein wetherbee dunbar and mission specialists marsha 
ivins and david low will concentrate on experiments for the rest of 
the flight the emphasis will be on materials processing and tests 
of how the human body adapts to weightlessness

slightly fewer people rode amtrak last year 
but they helped bring about record revenues by taking longer trips 
and spending more on food the quasigovernmental corporation 
reported 
in a report for fiscal 1989 which ended sept 30 the national 
railroad passenger corporation said the number of passengers dipped 
from 215 million to 214 million 
but revenues of 127 billion were up from 11 billion a year 
earlier passenger miles defined as one passenger being carried 
one mile rose from 57 billion in 1988 to 59 billion amtrak 
reported 
that income covered 72 percent of amtraks costs up from 69 
percent a year earlier and the best revenuetocost performance in 
the agencys history it said in the report released monday 
the difference between revenues and costs is made up by federal 
appropriations amtrak says its goal is to eliminate operating 
subsidies from the government in the next 10 years 
as recently as 1981 amtraks revenues covered less than half of 
its costs 
president bush proposed in his first budget last year to 
eliminate amtrak subsidies just as president reagan had done 
earlier but congress went ahead with funds for amtrak providing 
615 million for the current fiscal year 1990 
amtrak said that to end the dependence on operating subsidies it 
will need capital grants to expand its fleet and facilities 
in the annual report amtrak said passengerrelated revenue 
climbed nearly 14 percent from 766 million in fiscal 1988 to 870 
million passengerrelated revenue includes receipts from fares and 
foodservice sales 
the rest of the revenue came from mail and express shipments 
real estate income and other activities 
the average trip was for 274 miles last year compared with 264 
miles in the previous year amtrak said part of the reason for the 
halfpercent decline in passenger numbers was that cars had to be 
taken out of service temporarily as part of a more aggressive 
program of equipment maintenance

the bush administration urged the supreme 
court tuesday to allow student bible and prayer groups to meet on 
public school grounds arguing that such a ruling would preserve 
religious freedom 
however a lawyer for omaha neb school officials whose 
refusal to approve a biblereading club led to the case said 
education administrators must have the authority to make such 
decisions 
solicitor general kenneth w starr the administrations chief 
courtroom lawyer urged the court to interpret expansively a 1984 
federal law aimed at permitting religious clubs in public high 
schools 
as envisioned by congress the equal access acts primary 
thrust was to protect religious liberty starr said during an 
hourlong argument in the nebraska case its quite clear the 
purpose of the act was to eliminate discrimination against 
religious groups 
opponents of the 1984 law say it violates the constitutionally 
required separation of church and state 
but the justices expected to announce a decision by july 
focused on a narrow issue the scope of the law 
the act says public high schools accepting federal aid must not 
discriminate against groups based on the religious political 
philosophical or other content of the speech at such meetings 
the law requires access to school facilities for religious clubs 
if other noncurriculumrelated student groups are allowed to 
meet 
most of tuesdays argument focused on whether such student 
activities as chess and scuba diving clubs are related to school 
curriculum and whether judges or school officials should decide 
that question 
allen e daubman a lawyer for the school system said omahas 
westside high school had not authorized a public forum for any 
group to meet on school grounds simply by authorizing clubs related 
to classroom learning 
chess helps students learn mathematics and logic he said scuba 
diving is linked to the schools physical fitness program 
if the equal access act is interpreted to force schools to 
permit student religious groups in such cases it stifles the 
efforts of educators to structure a program that is relevant and 
provides benefits to the students daubman said 
but jay alan sekulow representing the group of students who 
tried to form the biblereading club said the law would be made 
worthless by administrative fiat if the school officials 
prevail 
chief justice william h rehnquist said daubman seemed to be 
arguing for total discretion for school administrators he said the 
lawyers position allows any school district to totally avoid the 
act 
but justice john paul stevens warned of a danger if the 
biblereading group wins the case 
there is a price if a school becomes a political forum 
stevens told sekulow all these other groups must be permitted 
for example stevens suggested the school would be forced to 
provide meeting space for those who back the democratic or 
republican party groups that advocate drug use and even the ku 
klux klan 
congress did not ask the school administrators to surrender 
control of the schools sekulow replied there is yet to be 
that parade of horribles 
justice byron r white said sekulows position was not very 
illuminating and said it might be a good idea to send the case 
back to the lower courts for further study 
some organizations such as the national school boards 
association have argued that the federal law is a thinly disguised 
move to return prayer to the public schools a 1962 high court 
ruling banned organized schoolsponsored prayer sessions for 
students 
students at westside high sought recognition in 1985 of a 
christian bible study club officials refused to approve it and 
suggested the students meet instead at a church next door 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals last year overruled a 
federal judge saying the club must be allowed to meet on school 
premises 
the justices ruled in 1981 that staterun universities cannot 
ban student groups from using campus facilities for religious 
worship and study but the justices have never decided whether the 
same rule should apply to public high schools

lithuanian demonstrators demanding independence 
for their republic confronted the visiting kremlin ideology chief 
tuesday in a prelude to rallies planned for mikhail s gorbachevs 
expected visit 
you want to leave the soviet union vadim a medvedev asked 
a crowd of protesters on the snowy square near kaunas lithuanias 
second largest city 
a woman responded that she favored independence within the 
framework of the soviet federation of 15 republics 
but medvedev in a scene broadcast on soviet tv repeated the 
question and before receiving another answer said for being 
independent having rights so that sovereignty was filled with 
real content we are for that we arent against that we are for 
that and thats what reforms are for 
but by his question and tone he implied that the moscow 
leadership favored granting lithuanians these rights as part of the 
union and remained opposed to lithuanian secession 
medvedevs visit to the baltic republic is intended to help 
defuse one of the most serious political crises facing gorbachev 
on dec 20 the republics communist party voted to rupture ties 
with its national parent the the first such break since the 
communists took power in moscow in 1917 
lithuanians who had their own country before josef stalin 
annexed it in 1940 as part of a secret nazisoviet treaty are 
making no secret that the next step is a complete political break 
with moscow 
on monday medvedev had told lithuanian factory workers 
nobody is against independence but let this be together with the 
soviet communist party 
tuesdays encounter symbolized the showdown between the kremlin 
and the republics 37 million people 
a poster carried by protesters who greeted medvedev at a 
speaking engagement read we are for an independent lithuania 
separation of the party is only the first step toward 
independence said kazimieras motieka a lithuanian 
representative in the soviet legislature and leader of the sajudis 
political movement 
giant demonstrations are planned wednesday and thursday in the 
republics capital vilnius the protests were originally timed to 
coincide with a visit by gorbachev who hopes to bring lithuanians 
back into the fold 
but communist party officials in vilnius said gorbachev was not 
expected to arrive until thursday at the earliest sajudis 
spokesmen said they would still proceed with the demonstration 
even though lithuanian communist leaders had asked them to call it 
off 
the stakes for the visit are high because the lithuanian party 
split could encourage others in the soviet union to follow suit 
politburo member alexander n yakovlev warned monday of a domino 
effect 
wednesdays demonstration was scheduled in cathedral square a 
popular protest site in downtown vilnius next to a roman catholic 
cathedral 
thursdays protest was to include protesters from throughout the 
republic and motieka predicted a turnount of hundreds of 
thousands masses were planned thursday evening

the energy department will decide within the 
next two weeks whether to build a smaller super collider 
atomsmasher or to spend more to keep the giant machine as 
originally envisioned sen phil gramm rtexas said tuesday 
gramm said the energy departments high energy physics advisory 
board would meet friday to assess the impact of potential 
reductions on the scientific capacity of the machine which is to 
be built in ellis county south of dallas 
meanwhile the ssc laboratory in desoto texas which is under 
contract to build the collider is examining the cost of design 
changes gramm said 
once both groups submit their findings next tuesday to energy 
secretary james watkins he is expected to decide what he will 
propose to congress by the end of the month gramm said after 
meeting with deputy energy secretary henson moore 
gramm said he still has no estimate of the extra cost needed to 
buld the machine as originally planned although a 1 billion 
increase has been mentioned by some officials 
the total cost of the accelerator had been estimated earlier at 
59 billion expressed as the sum of annual expenditures by the 
time operation begins in the late 1990s 
my guess is there will be a compromise we want to be sure 
that we dont buy a cadillac that we buy a chevrolet gramm said 
as originally planned the collider would be a 53mile 
underground tunnel in which beams of protons would be hurled into 
each other at energies 20 times what is possible today 
gramm has said previously that one problem with the collider is 
that the mechanism that would inject proton beams into the 
underground ring as originally planned is too small for a 53mile 
oval

thing 
the rest of the museum 35 miles southwest of peoria will 
remain open its main exhibit centers on the burial plot containing 
the skeletons of 237 people who lived in the illinois river valley 
in fulton county about 800 to 1000 years ago 
a musuem in wickliffe ky is also closing a similar indian 
burial exhibit which an official said has sparked local complaints 
from indian groups 
exhibiting human remains is not ethical or the most sensitive 
thing to do and we intend to close our exhibit said kit wesler

now heres a city thats not out to get 
your goat 
the city council on monday unanimously rejected a proposed 
ordinance that would have limited the number of goats per back yard 
and forced owners to keep them in cages at least 20 feet from a 
neighbors property line 
the vote came after all 10 of the people who spoke at a public 
hearing opposed the proposal most saying goats make cleaner pets 
than dogs or cats 
peter wangsness whose pygmy goats prompted the complaints which 
led city officials to draft the proposal said he was happy about 
the vote 
wangsness said he hadnt heard from the neighbor who complained 
about the goats since a city judge threw out the mans 
criminalnuisance complaint last fall 
wangsness testified that both nasa and the planners of biosphere 
ii a selfsufficient sealed environment in which scientists plan 
to spend two years much like a long space flight picked goats as 
an ideal domestic animal for space travel

a rightwing west german political party 
denounced as neonazis by the east german government said it 
will organize for east german elections and predicted tuesday it 
would get 10 percent of the vote 
also tuesday east german environment minister hans reichelt 
resigned following opposition attacks that the countrys former 
hardline communist leaders turned it into one of the most polluted 
nations in europe the official east german news agency adn gave no 
reason for reichelts resignation 
in west berlin the top figure in an east german financial 
scandal alexander schalckgolodkowski was freed after a 
prosecutor doubted that he could get a fair trial in east germany 
the government of communist prime minister hans modrow has 
promised elections may 6 but it has vowed to keep west germanys 
republican party from organizing saying that the rightwing 
extemist group is a neonazi organization 
but the republican party chief franz schoenhuber told a news 
conference in west berlin that the republicans would soon set up 
electoral groups throughout east germany 
we will find ways and means to get tons of campaign material 
into the german democratic republic east germany said 
schoenhuber a former nazi waffen ss soldier 
while schoenhuber predicted a result of at least 10 percent in 
may other party leaders say it could be 15 percent 
either figure if it were to be reached would give the 
republicans a prominent role among the factions jockeying for 
control of east germany 
carsten pagel the republicans spokesman in west berlin said 
100 east germans had signed up as members of the party 
east germanys communists have warned of an alleged threat from 
rightwing extremists but opposition leaders say they are 
exaggerating the threat in a bid to remain in power and take 
advantage of opposition infighting 
thousands of communists have resigned from the party since 
demonstrations forced the resignation of hardline leader erich 
honecker in october but the party still controls the media key 
meeting places and supplies of such essentials as paper the 
communists have been accused of unfairly exploiting that power 
in west berlin prosecutor dietrich schultz said 
schalckgolodkowski had been released tuesday because west german 
officials see no grounds for prosecuting him 
schalckgolodkowski who turned himself in to west berlin 
authorities dec 6 is wanted in east germany on embezzlement 
charges and for allegedly overseeing a ring selling weapons to 
countries in south america africa and the middle east 
schalckgolodkowski the former chief foreign trader under 
honecker had said he repaid 31 million to east germany from swiss 
bank accounts but that is only a small part of what east germanys 
official news media claim he had embezzled 
in other developments 
the former no 2 official of east germanys governmentrun 
labor federation was found dead in her east berlin apartment the 
union said west germanys bild newspaper claimed that johanna 
toepfer had committed suicide over the weekend she and the rest of 
the union leadership had been forced to resign in disgrace last 
month amid democratic reforms 
an east german newspaper reported that six olympic champions 
and several east german national team stars have joined foreign 
clubs legally since the country opened its borders in november 
under the headline our christmas sale the newspaper junge 
welt published a list of the players who included four olympic 
cycling champions handball player wieland schmidt and weightlifter 
joachim kunz the list did not include several soccer and handball 
players who emigrated to west germany without official permission 
since the political changes and the opening of east germanys 
borders a number of east german stars have been allowed to go 
abroad in return for badly needed foreign currency 
former east german communist leader egon krenz has been 
stripped of his last remnant of public office a parliament seat 
adn said 
adn published a brief statement by krenz saying he resigned from 
the peoples chamber at the wish of my partys leadership 
krenz replaced honecker last oct 18 after 18 years as communist 
party chief but he resigned from that and other leadership posts 
only six weeks later under popular pressure 
the statement carried by adn gave no indications of krenzs

american schoolchildren are dreadfully 
inadequate in the two basic tools of learning reading and 
writing education secretary lauro cavazos said tuesday in 
releasing results of two nationwide studies 
the nations report card conducted in 1988 by the federally 
funded national assessment of educational progress said overall 
reading and writing performance of students aged 9 13 and 17 
remained virtually unchanged since the last assessment was reported 
in 1984 
the report found only subtle changes in reading performance at 
the national level since the first reading assessment in 1971 
there was no improvement in an alreadylow writing performance 
as a nation we should be appalled that we have placed our 
children in such jeopardy cavazos told reporters the reading 
and writing skills of american students remain dreadfully 
inadequate 
reading and writing are the basic tools of learning the crux 
of the academic enterprise without solid literacy skills we can 
never expect to see improvements in math or science history or 
geography and the costs will be staggering he said 
the national education association said the findings offer 
national education goal setters some important food for thought 
the educational testing service said the results warrant attention 
from all policy leaders educators and parents 
national assessment or naep uses five levels of reading 
proficiency to define students reading skills and strategies 
rudimentary basic intermediate adept and advanced 
key findings in the reading report were 
since 1980 the percentage of 9yearolds with basic reading 
skills the ability to understand specific or sequentially related 
information has declined from 68 to 63 percent seven percent 
lack rudimentary skills required to carry out simple reading tasks 
fortytwo percent of all 13yearolds lack the skills needed to 
read at the next highest level which calls for the ability to 
interrelate ideas and make generalizations although black 
13yearolds have made steady improvements in acquiring these 
skills 61 percent are still unable to read at the intermediate 
level 
the percentage of 17yearolds reading at the intermediate 
level has increased steadily from 81 percent in 1980 to 86 
percent in 1988 
nearly 6 out of 10 58 percent of 17yearolds cannot read 
at the adept level which is defined as the ability to find 
understand summarize and explain relatively complicated 
information 
less than 5 percent of the nations 17yearolds are reading at 
the advanced level which includes skills needed to understand 
scientific materials literary essays historical documents and 
materials generally found in professional and technical work 
environments in 1971 nearly 7 percent were reading at the 
advanced level 
the overall picture suggests a nation of students who were 
reading better than their counterparts did in 1971 but it must be 
emphasized that the progress is slight and could be shortlived 
the report said 
the report said the gains for 17yearolds may be partially a 
legacy of progress made by these students when they were age 9 
unfortunately 9yearolds born more recently have shown a 
pattern of small but steady declines during the 1980s perhaps 
foreshadowing similar declines at ages 13 and 17 in the years ahead 
as these students move through our educational system 
the writing report card tested about 18000 students in 
grades four eight and 11 on their ability to write informative 
persuasive and imaginative pieces 
the key result was that the levels of writing performance in 
1988 appeared to be substantially the same as in 1974 many 
students continued to perform at minimal levels on the writing 
assessment tasks and relatively few performed at adequate or 
better levels 
according to the report in both 1984 and 1988 females were 
better writers than males at all grade levels black students 
improved slightly in some categories of written english such as 
punctuation and sentence structure 
finally the report said the fondness for writing declined with 
age 55 percent of fourth graders said they liked to write 
compared with 42 percent of eighth graders and 37 percent of 11th 
graders 
the key impact of todays reports is that they stress the need 
for us to redouble our efforts to ensure that every student masters 
the basics of reading and writing said nea vice president bob 
chase adding teachers need to spend more time with smaller groups 
of students

after four years of detective work the 
national gallery of art said tuesday it had solved a major whodunit 
in the history of art by fingering an obscure italian painter as 
responsible for mysterious alterations in giovanni bellinis 
masterpiece the feast of the gods 
david bull the gallerys chief of painting conservation said 
an exhaustive laboratory analysis shows that bellinis 475yearold 
work was repainted not only by his former pupil titian but by 
dosso dossi court painter to duke alfonso deste of ferrara 
previously it was known that the feast of the gods had 
undergone two drastic alterations within 15 years after bellini 
completed the large canvas in 1514 but art scholars long assumed 
that titian was responsible for both changes 
bull said tuesday that his study yielded the big discovery 
that dosso rather than titian was responsible for the first 
alteration in which a major portion of the landscape background was 
repainted 
bulls other major discovery was that in contrast to what 
scholars once thought titian had never tampered with bellinis 
figures in the painting a mythological scene of gods goddesses 
and satyrs enjoying a forest bacchanal 
left unanswered says bull is the question of why the bellini 
painting was altered at all 
previous assumptions about the mysteries of the feast of the 
gods were based largely on a 1956 study of the painting by john 
walker then director of the national gallery bull said walkers 
analysis was flawed because the painting was obscured by centuries 
of grime and yellowing varnish 
when the painting was removed from the national gallerys 
permanent exhibition in 1985 bull carefully cleaned the surface 
before beginning a detailed study using xrays highpowered 
microscopes infrared light beams and enlarged photographs of tiny 
crosssections of pigment 
by comparing portions of the work with the style and brushwork 
of other dosso paintings bull concluded that the court painter was 
responsible for the initial repainting of bellinis work he found 
that two dosso additions a pheasant and some of the background 
foliage were left intact by titian 
bull said his conclusions won the unanimous endorsement of a 
panel of art scholars who studied the results of his work for four 
days last march 
restored to its appearance in 1529 when titian completed his 
alterations the painting will return to public display this sunday 
until the end of april 
in may the feast of the gods will return to venice italy 
for the first time since bellini completed the painting to take 
its place in a major exhibition of titians works opening in june 
that show will open at the national gallery in october 
this is the only painting in existence that combines the work 
of bellini perhaps the leading painter of the 15th century and

a northwest airlines spokesman said tuesday 
the lavatory of a boeing 727 that dropped an engine over florida 
last week had been repaired eight times in the weeks leading to the 
incident which officials believe was linked to a leak in the 
sanitary system 
our records show that the lavatory was repaired eight times 
in the six weeks preceding the accident said airline spokesman 
doug miller from northwest headquarters in st paul minn 
federal inspectors were in atlanta examining the lavatory and 
fallen engine from the plane 
northwests flight 5 from miami to minneapolis made an 
emergency landing in tampa after the aircraft lost power the 
pilots later learned that the right engine one of three had 
fallen off the plane at 35000 feet above ground 
none of the 139 passengers or six crew members were injured 
the federal aviation administration said tuesday the lavatory 
had been repaired 10 times since november 1989 
were in the same ballpark said miller adding that the 
number of repairs is unusual but miller said that the problems had 
been repaired each time to the companys satisfaction that the 
jetliner flew a number of flights between repairs and that it 
wasnt the same identical problem each time 
miller acknowledged however that all the problems had to do 
with the blue fluid used to flush the toilets 
miller had earlier said the number of lavatory repairs was 
closer to five or six times but said the figure was revised 
after consultation with northwests executive in charge of 
maintenance 
officials theorize that the blue fluid leaked from the lavatory 
and may have frozen at higher altitudes broken free and been 
hurled into the engine the liquid would have caused the engine to 
vibrate and break off they theorize because engines on 727s are 
supposed to break free to avoid damaging the frame when they 
vibrate badly 
we intend to dismantle that lavatory tank and see what the 
problem is and talk to the people who repaired it last spokesman 
ted lopatkiewicz of the national transportation safety board said 
andrew alston of the ntsbs miami regional office traveled 
monday to atlanta and was expected to spend a couple of days on the 
examination said regional director george prellezo 
prellezo said the investigation was very simple and findings 
indicate the problem is limited we dont have a problem with all 
the airplanes he said 
miller said he could not discuss the specific repairs saying 
the company would leave it up to the ntsb to evaluate the record 
as recently as 1985 engines broke off 727s in flight and in 
each case the problem was traced to a leaking lavatory as a 
result the faa in 1986 ordered airlines to inspect lavatory valves 
in 727s every 200 flight hours or replace them with sturdier valves 
newer 727s have redesigned lavatory valves that are less likely 
to leak

the bush administration said tuesday that 
leaks about a proposed antidrug interdiction effort off the 
colombian coast have complicated us hopes of enlisting colombias 
cooperation in the initiative 
word of the proposed us deployment off the colombian coast has 
touched off rumors around the hemisphere that the united states 
might try to blockade colombia or perhaps even invade it as a 
followup to the us ouster last month of panamas gen manuel 
antonio noriega 
defense secretary dick cheney has been pondering options for 
more extensive use of the military in the antidrug campaign and is 
expected to make recommendations to president bush 
defense department sources said that the aircraft carrier john 
f kennedy has been chosen to lead an interdiction effort off 
colombia but that final decisions about when the warship may be 
deployed havent been made yet 
the carrier and an accompanying guided missile cruiser the uss 
virginia left norfolk va thursday to engage in routine training 
exercises in the atlantic officials have said 
but the officials added that a question remained as to when and 
if the warships would see duty in the proposed interdiction effort 
colombian officials reportedly refused to meet with a us team 
sent to bogota last week to discuss the subject 
asked whether the furor in colombia has left the administration 
embarrassed state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said 
were not embarrassed but it certainly has complicated the 
consultation process 
the us isolation in the hemisphere was underscored monday 
when the organization of american states voted 190 in support of a 
resolution calling the penetration last month by us troops of the 
nicaraguan ambassadors residence in panama a violation of 
international law 
another complicating factor for us diplomats was the decision 
by us troops to surround the residence of the peruvian ambassador 
to panama where government officials said two of noriegas former 
associates reportedly have taken refuge peruvian officials have 
denied that the men were inside the building 
the officials are worried about a nationalistic reaction in 
peru whose president alan garcia is one of three andean leaders 
scheduled to attend next months fournation antidrug summit with 
bush in colombia the others are the presidents of colombia and 
bolivia 
garcia reacted angrily to the us invasion of panama and has 
said he may not attend the summit if the american troops are still 
there by the time of the summit

a former nursing assistant with aids who 
confessed killing seven elderly patients then said the confessions 
were bogus pleaded guilty tuesday to murdering one of those 
patients and was sentenced to life 
jeffrey feltner 27 who has said he gave bogus confessions to 
draw attention to poor conditions in nursing homes pleaded guilty 
to firstdegree murder in the death of a 75yearold woman after 
prosecutors played recordings of his previous statements about the 
deaths 
feltner heard his taped confessions and after hearing the 
evidence entered a plea of guilty said assistant state attorney 
david damore 
a jury had been seated for his trial just the day before 
feltner confessed numerous times during a yearlong 
investigation of the seven suspicious retirement home deaths 
police said adding that the victims were smothered 
feltner was sentenced to life with a mandatory minimum of 25 
years 
he could have faced the death penalty if convicted of 
firstdegree murder in february 1988 of a 75yearold resident of 
the new life acres retirement home in melrose a north florida city 
20 miles west of palatka 
it was an excellent and wise move on his behalf said 
feltners attorney howard pearl but he denies killing anyone 
his statements would have damaged him i felt it was time for 
damage control 
feltner still faces murder charges in nearby volusia county in 
the death of an 83yearold woman and attorneys were trying to work 
out a plea in that case 
prosecutors did not press charges in the remaining five deaths 
in four of those cases the bodies had already been cremated 
asked the motive for the killings damore replied you would 
have to ask jeffrey feltner obviously you have a person with a 
very troubled mind 
pearl said feltner has acquired immune deficiency syndrome and 
is receiving treatments with the drug azt 
he wants to be treated for aids said pearl he wants to 
recover his health 
after he was arrested last summer and charged with killing a 
volusia county patient feltner wrote a letter to his father and 
stepmother in michigan explaining that he had not killed anyone 
but had devised a plan that would help officials notice poor 
nursinghome conditions 
i wanted to spend what time i have left to do something that 
everyone would be proud of but like always i messed up feltner 
wrote 
when i went to work in the nursing homes and saw the abuse 
they were getting i told myself that i would try and help them 
he wrote everything i tried to do did not work so i had to say 
that i killed some people hoping that they would see the abuse 
that they were getting 
feltners father and stepmother kasper and norma feltner of 
michigan have said they believe he is innocent

the freezing christmas weather that ripped 
into winter vegetable areas of florida and texas sharply reduced 
acreage to be harvested for broccoli celery lettuce and tomatoes 
according to an agriculture department report tuesday 
overall farmers are expected to have about 191000 acres of 
seven selected winter vegetables for harvest this season down 8 
percent from a year ago the report said 
no production estimates were given in the report 
in texas for example no carrots are expected to be harvested 
although carrot acreage is up in california and florida 
celery for harvest in florida is down 14 percent from a year 
ago however and the sweet corn acreage was reported down by 35 
percent the texas lettuce acreage was reported to be cut 79 
percent from last winter while the florida tomato acreage is down 
32 percent 
but the florida harvest of winter strawberries is expected to be 
from 5400 acres up 2 percent from last year 
growers saved most plants from the christmas weekend freeze by 
forming ice caps on plants with overhead sprinklers the report 
said the freeze will lower yields because fewer pickings will be 
made virtually all plants are expected to survive if temperatures 
remain moderate for the next few weeks 
looking at the carrot situation most of floridas crop was 
destroyed although growers are expected to replant most if not 
all of the lost acreage the report said part of the severely 
damaged crop in the rio grande valley of texas may be salvaged by 
hand harvesting if the price is high enough 
department analysts have said that while citrus and fresh 
vegetable prices are expected to rise in the first quarter overall 
consumer food prices in 1990 are still expected to go up a modest 3 
percent to 5 percent compared with an average of 57 percent in 
1989 the sharpest gain since 1981 
one reason is that vegetable fields can be replanted quickly so 
that theres a minimum lag in supplies they said 
in a related report the governments joint agricultural weather 
facility said florida vegetable farmers enjoyed warm weather in 
major producing areas during the week of dec 31jan 6 
planting and replanting was active under nearly ideal weather 
conditions the report said harvest continued but supplies of 
most crops were reduced 
the joint facility which is operated by the agriculture and 
commerce departments said freeze damage in texas became more 
evident in the rio grande valley lettuce and celery were 
severely damaged and onions also suffered some loss it said

thousands of panamanians celebrated 
the downfall of gen manuel antonio noriega at a memorial mass 
tuesday and about 150 others marched in the first antiamerican 
demonstration since the dec 20 invasion 
both events commemorated the day of the martyrs a national 
holiday in memory of 23 panamanians who died in antiamerican riots 
in 1964 
the throng of 8000 at the outdoor mass in suburban el dorado 
were more in a mood to celebrate than to mourn the dead shouting 
viva panama as priests nuns and religious workers asked 
jesus to guide me and help me build the new society 
archbishop marcos mcgrath presided before an audience that used 
colorful umbrellas to protect themselves from a hot morning sun 
followed by rain those attending included president guillermo 
endara first and second vice presidents ricardo arias calderon and 
guillermo ford and papal nuncio sebastian laboa 
the hatred and rancor sown in the past cannot and should not 
characterize the future said mcgrath in his homily dubbing the 
day one of reconciliation conversion and recontruction 
meanwhile about 150 people held the first demonstration against 
the us army assault gathering at santa teresa church in maranon 
a lowincome neighborhood less than a mile from noriegas former 
defense headquarters for a mass celebrated by six priests 
including three americans 
endara arias calderon and ford will be remembered by future 
panamanian generations as oligarchs in the service of a foreign 
power said a pamphlet distributed by the tiny socialist workers 
party which opposed noriega the six years he was in power 
the marchers included university students and labor leaders who 
said they had also opposed noriega but condemned the savage 
yankee invasion that cut an open wound in our national 
sovereignty 
noriega often presented himself as panamas defender against 
us aggression and representative of a generation with a mission 
to gain control of the panama canal which will be taken over by 
panama on dec 31 1999 
the day of the martyrs commemorates one of the flashpoints of 
panamanian nationalism the jan 9 1964 riots that left 23 
panamanians and four us soldiers dead the riots began in a 
dispute over whether the panamanian flag should fly at balboa high 
school 
its a day of profound deep thought so none of these things 
happen ever again second vice president ford told a reporter 
us troops searching for noriega henchmen continued to surround 
several embassies including the peruvian ambassadors residence 
where peru said it granted diplomatic asylum to a top noriega 
security aide and 11 others 
the security aide capt gonzalo gonzalez was granted asylum 
along with noriegas secretary capt marcela tason his top press 
spokesman maj edgardo lopez grimaldo and maj heraclides sucre 
a commander of the elite battalion 2000 
peruvian charge daffairs luis sandiga denied panamanian charges 
that the residence was sheltering lt col luis papo cordova 
one of noriegas mostwanted associates 
the only security at the el dorado mass was a handful of 
bodyguards around the new panamanian leaders while dozens of 
unarmed firemen and young men and women from the scouts of panama 
cordoned off the crowd with ropes 
under huge panamanian and vatican flags about 80 priests donned 
white robes over blue jeans to assist mcgrath in communion 
the archbishop presiding from a podium in front of a looted 
dress shop stacked with undressed mannequins asked those who 
plundered stores throughout panama city to return the goods make 
financial amends or provide community service 
do it he said take it upon your soul to remove that 
stain from your home community and your conscience 
we are all a little to blame for all the evil which befell 
us said mcgrath everyone should recognize that in their 
hearts if we dont do that the errors of the past will be 
repeated 
the dozens gathered for the protest marched 20 blocks in silence 
to the amador cemetery near the joint uspanamanian installation 
at fort amador where some of the 1964 victims are buried 
the rev jose luis medina said panamanians were confused and 
thats why they were celebrating the american invasion we must 
accompany these people be patient with them he said 
the rev diego caffley a philadelphian who has been in panama 
17 years said panamanians should help recreate true nationalism 
not the phony nationalism of the old regime 
the crowd waved panamanian flags and banners reading the 
fatherland is in mourning and broke up after about 10 minutes at 
the cemetery 
at the huge el dorado mass panamanians waved white lace 
handkerchiefs in the rain and sang the national anthem as the mass 
ended 
asked if he forgave noriega and the dignity battalion henchmen 
who beat him after the may 7 presidential election ford said 
look im a catholic and if you repent i forgive but i dont 
know if mr noriega has repented 
noriega imprisoned in miami faces us drug trafficking 
charges that carry penalties totaling 145 years in jail 
officials say about 600 panamanian soldiers and civilians died 
during the us invasion that ousted noriega twentythree us 
soldiers also died in the invasion

the president of the national urban league 
said tuesday that reduced eastwest tensions represent a narrow 
window of opportunity to switch military dollars to help blacks 
whose economic progress was stalled during the military buildup of 
the 1980s 
government and business leaders should use the money to develop 
an urban marshall plan and investment bank to help close the 
economic gap between whites and blacks and ensure american 
competitiveness in the 21st century said league president john e 
jacob as the civil rights group released its annual assessment on 
the status of black americans 
jacob said in the overview of the report that the state of 
black america remains critical despite a year of hope that began 
with a new administration and ended with changing world conditions 
that might shift national concern and resources to domestic issues 
at a time when we hear policymakers talk of a new marshall 
plan and a new economic development bank for eastern europe we 
need to press for an urban marshall plan and an urban investment 
bank that invests in our own people and in our own cities jacob 
said at a news conference 
the plan would be aimed at bringing the people at the margins 
of our society into the mainstream to become producers in a 
productive society jacob said 
jacob said money for the plan could come from cutting the 300 
billion defense budget in half to 150 billion 
he said a government investment of 50 billion to help 
minorities rise would demonstrate a national will and 
commitment he recommended using 100 billion to reduce the 
federal deficit 
president bush has said that if there is a peace dividend it 
will go to lowering the federal deficit and not to expanding social 
programs and he told high school students in denver on dec 8 that 
the notion that congress might make drastic slashes in the 
defense budget and then take the money in whats called a peace 
dividend was crazy 
i will not acquiesce in that bush said 
the eastern european change is very exciting and can lead 
through arms control agreements to agreed lower levels of 
defense bush said then even though thats happening i think 
it would be imprudent to make reckless cuts in our defense 
previous league reports decried efforts to dismantle social 
programs in the reagan era and spoke of increased racism in the 
1980s but jacob said increased access to the bush administration 
made him optimistic about government response to his organizations 
new recommendations 
we spent 2 trillion in the past ten years on defense because 
we were locked into a wartime mentality that now has no basis in 
fact said jacob citing recent events in east europe 
the end of the cold war must mean the start of a renewed drive 
to bring america into the 21st century by investing in its people 
and its economy he added 
the leagues urban marshall plan would include emphasis on 
developing effective education jobs and training health care and 
housing programs for minorities and women jacob said minority and 
female workers would make up the largest portion of new workers 
during the 1990s 
the original marshall plan was a us aid program that helped 
europe recover from the devastation of world war ii 
the countrys need for more skilled and technologically adept 
workers to compete in current global markets represents an 
opportunity for blacks said jacob who warned that others might 
support efforts to import workers from elsewhere 
america simply will not be able to compete with the japanese 
and the europeans unless america develops the human resources and 
the only ones we currently have are those who are being squandered 
among the minorities he said 
jacob did not offer specifics for the plan but included in the 
leagues report the state of black america 1990 are 12 
chapters of discussions on such topics as recent supreme court 
civil rights decisions blackonblack crime and the election of 
the nations first black governor l douglas wilder in virginia 
jacob said us businesses also had a vested interest in black 
educational and economic progress citing a recent incident 
involving a new york firm that was forced to test 57000 people 
before the company found 2000 people qualified for jobs it needed 
to fill

at least 200 liberian civilians were massacred 
in northern liberia and eyewitnesses fleeing the country attribute 
the killings to government forces a human rights group reported 
tuesday 
the killings are the result of a dec 24 attempt to topple 
president samuel k doe according to africa watch the 
organization is a division of the private human rights watch that 
monitors abuses around the world 
president felix houphouetboigny of neighboring ivory coast 
reported that between 8000 and 10000 liberians fled into his 
country in recent days the group said 
africa watch has also received reports of a shoottokill 
policy instituted by president doe who has instructed troops 
fighting rebel forces to shoot on sight any persons engaged in 
suspicious activities the organization said 
its statement also said three liberian villages along the border 
with the ivory coast kahnplay boutuo and lepulah were 
destroyed in the fighting 
doe a former army sergeant who seized power in a 1980 coup 
told a rally in monrovia on saturday that government troops were 
searching for more rebels he ordered his countrymen to turn in the 
dissidents whom he said were based in the ivory coast 
this is the second coup attempt against doe in four years 
although he has accused opponents of plotting additional overthrows 
which he foiled critics say he concocted some of the alleged plots 
in order to eliminate rivals 
the state department said it did not have any information or 
comment about the coup attempt and the reported killings 
human rights watch last week accused the bush administration of 
failing to use its leverage with doe to speak out against his 
violations 
liberia founded by former american slaves in the 19th century 
is the largest recipient of us aid per capita in subsaharan 
africa and a strategic ally of the united states 
it is the only nation in western africa that allows us 
military planes to refuel and the administrations voice of 
america has transmitters there we believe such factors cannot 
justify funding and silently condoning abuses by the liberian 
government said human right watch

foreign ministers mesut yilmaz of turkey and boiko 
dimitrov of bulgaria ended a second session of talks on the rights 
of ethnic turkish moslems in bulgaria and said a joint communique 
would be issued wednesday 
neither minister would say much about tuesdays meeting nor 
would officials from kuwait which is mediating the dispute 
however sources close to the talks said turkey seemed inclined 
to accept as sufficient redress the new bulgarian governments 
reversal of the assimilation campaign pursued by ousted communist 
leader todor zhivkov 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said dimitrov 
gave assurances the new administration in sofia would not yield to 
pressure of widespread demonstrations in bulgaria against the 
reversal 
they implied that the issue of more than 300000 ethnic turks 
who fled bulgaria last year and sought refuge in turkey now was 
going to be left as an issue between turkey and the refugees some 
have been returning after the new bulgarian decisions but many 
have so far preferred to remain in turkey 
under the assimilation policy ethnic turks could not speak 
their mother tongue or practice the moslem religion and were forced 
to adopt bulgarian names 
the two ministers conducted in a constructive and frank spirit 
a detailed and comprehensive review of the relations between 
bulgaria and turkey and means of normalizing these relations in the 
future their brief statement said 
it said the two ministers on tuesday also expresed their 
governments desire to improve their relations on a sound basis of 
mutual benefit with a view to reaching better understanding 
the statement said both sides would hold a meeting toward this 
end at the opening session of an international open atmosphere 
conference in ottawa on feb 2225 
during a break in the working sessions yilmaz and dimitrov 
described the talks as positive but gave no details 
the first round of talks under kuwaiti auspices were held in 
october 
at that time turkey pressed for guaranteed rights of the 
refugees as well as the rest of the turkish minority in bulgaria 
it also sought a settlement of the refugee problem within its 
borders possibly with the financial help of other moslem countries 
foreign minister sheik sabah alahmed of kuwait inaugurated the 
second session at bayan palace eight miles south of the city 
center kuwait is involved as president of the 46member 
organization of the islamic conference 
in another development tuesday bulgarias ambassador in 
britain dimitar zhulev said his government will hold an inquiry 
into the 1978 murder of georgi markov a bulgarian emigre believed 
to have been murdered in london by a poisoned umbrella 
zhulev told foreign office minister william waldegrave that 
markov had been reinstated as a posthumous member of the union of 
bulgarian writers that restored his professional status 
british investigators concluded that markov who worked for the 
british broadcasting corps bulgarian service was killed by 
poison injected through an umbrella tip as he waited for a bus on 
sept 29 1978 
i think that this really has to be cleared up before we can 
see a new bulgaria because it is a stain on its reputation 
markovs widow annabel said in an interview with bbctv 
mrs markov has gone to bulgaria seeking more information on the 
case 
waldegrave a personal friend of the markovs last month asked 
bulgarian authorities to open up the books on the case

drivers of the 1990 mitsubishi eclipse 
hatchback and chevrolet lumina sedan run a possible risk of 
head injury in a collision federal safety officials said 
no comparable risk was found for drivers of the 1990 acura 
integra sedan the national highway traffic safety administration 
also said the risk of head injury to passengers was less than 
probable so was the risk of chest injury to drivers and 
passengers also when data were available 
nhtsas report monday on crash tests of the three vehicles was 
the first for the 1990 model year under the new car assessment 
program 
the vehicles were tested by driving them headon into a fixed 
barrier creating the same conditions as a headon collision 
between two identical vehicles at 35 miles an hour 
the test results apply only to occupants using seat belts and 
in certain cars air bags the tests are conducted using dummies 
that represent an averagesized adult male 
according to the nhtsa index a score of 750 or lower means head 
injury is unlikely 7501250 means head injury is possible and 
anything higher means head injury is likely 
chest injury numbers above 60 indicate that chest injury is 
likely 
the lower any of the numbers the lower the potential for 
injury but for purposes of comparison vehicles have to be of the 
same type and weigh within 500 pounds of each other 
the integra and eclipse are both light vehicles in the 
25002999 pound range the integra had a driver head injury 
rating of 585 passenger head injury rating of 637 and a passenger 
chest injury rating of 42 no information was available on driver 
chest injuries 
the lumina which rates as a heavy vehicle at 3632 pounds had 
a driver head injury rating of 1200 with no data on passenger 
head injuries the driver chest injury rating was 58 and there was 
no data on passenger chest injuries 
the report marks the first time the agency categorized vehicles 
by weight specified the occupant protection system and used the 
categories unlikely possible or likely

educators concerned with the plight of 
minority students offered tuesday a wideranging plan to 
restructure american education including one proposal to stop 
grouping elementary school students by age 
improving education is the most important challenge facing 
america if we are to maintain our ability to compete in the world 
and sustain our standard of living said ray marshall former 
secretary of labor who is chairman of the action council a part of 
the quality education for minorities project 
with minorities comprising 70 percent of the enrollment in the 
top largest 25 us school districts and 40 percent of the new 
entrants into the work force over the next decade it is clear that 
success in the education of minorities is synonymous with continued 
economic success for america said marshall a professor at the 
university of texas at austin 
the qem project which is based at the massachusetts institute 
of technology and directed by shirley mcbay dean for student 
affairs at mit is funded by a 12 million grant from the carnegie 
corp fiftyeight major changes are recommended for the nations 
educational system 
the entire list of recommendations would cost billions of 
dollars and officials estimate it would require 37 billion alone 
for one recommendation that each student attend school for 12 
straight months every three years 
key recommendations contained in the groups national study 
education that works would radically transform elementary 
and middleschool education so that students no longer compete with 
their peers but work more in groups and teams 
project officials describe the study and the action plan as 
the first comprehensive national strategy prepared by and for 
minority americans to improve the entire educational system 
more than two years were spent gathering information that 
reflect the experience and ideas of five minority groups alaska 
natives american indians afroamericans mexicanamericans and 
puerto ricans 
one recommendation was to eliminate the practice of grouping 
students by their abilities and their ages while in elementary 
school 
many alert and curious minority youngsters arrive in 
kindergarten eager to learn yet are channelled into school 
structures that sap their curiosity and numb their minds said 
the report by the third grade they begin to fall behind and may 
be at a grave disadvantage educationally before they leave 
elementary school 
instead the study called for a system of grouping and grading 
students based on their mastery of specific skills or combination 
of skills 
this approach lends itself particularly well to cooperative 
learning and team teaching the report said 
middle schools the report said should be redesigned into small 
learning communities so that minority students would have the 
opportunity to establish key relationships with teachers and other 
adults who can help the youngsters foster belief in their own 
potential as well as in the value of education itself 
high schools should replace the general curriculum with a core 
academic curriculum jointly developed by representatives of the 
local community business higher education and ethnic 
organizations in this way students can move from high school to 
either college or the workforce 
other recommendations were to 
establish longer school days and years to prevent summer 
learning losses and pay teachers for the additional time 
improve the image pay and benefits of the teaching profession 
make student achievement the main criterion against which 
teachers and administrators are judged 
respect and value the culture of each child in the curriculum

the head of irans tanker operations said 
tuesday that its damaged ship in the atlantic was in danger of 
spilling more oil in rough seas because spain would not allow it 
into their territorial waters the islamic republic news agency 
reported 
mohammed souri managing director of the national iranian tanker 
co also explained the reasons behind the dec 19 explosion that 
caused the khark 5 to spill what oil experts said was 19 million 
gallons of oil off morocco 
he said a piece of the ships superstructure tore off in 100 mph 
winds and slammed onto the deck sparking an explosion in a tank 
the explosion caused several other blasts including a fire that 
salvage crews were summoned to extinguish souri said 
the crew was forced to abandon ship 400 miles north of the 
canary islands 
salvage officials said the blasts punched a hole in the side of 
the ship allowing crude to leak into the sea 
souri however said the amount of oil spilled was not known 
the spill threatened to seriously damage the fisheries and 
beaches of the moroccan coast but oil experts said the areas warm 
waters and rough seas broke up virtually all of the spill 
souri accused morocco of exaggerating the incident 
the moroccan government has launched a widescale 
propaganda tirade and called for financial aid from some countries 
with the aim of hollow financial claims irna reported him as 
saying 
souri said the spanish government instead of dispatching war 
ships to shadow the tanker should allow the tanker into one of its 
ports so the oil on board could be transferred to a supertanker 
salvage officials said 53 million gallons of light iranian crude 
oil remain on board 
the iranian official said rough weather was hindering the 
transfer and risked a renewed spill 
if the ship was allowed to discharge its crude into another 
ship the amount of pollution would be greatly less than it is 
now souri said 
spanish maritime officials on monday said three tugs were towing 
the khark 5 to calm seas off the cape verde islands in order to 
safely transfer the oil they said the voyage could take 10 days 
smit tak the dutch salvage company in charge of the operation 
said the ship had not leaked since last wednesday

a former university of pennsylvania 
professor praised a supreme court ruling tuesday that ordered the 
school to disclose information she claims will show she was denied 
tenure because of discrimination 
im very delighted with the decision said rosalie tung now 
a business professor at the university of wisconsin i fought for 
the principle and im glad that i won it 
penn and its supporters expressed concern the decision might 
chill tenure review of academics by their peers 
ms tung then an associate professor of management at penn 
complained after she was denied tenure in 1985 at the universitys 
wharton school of business she filed a complaint with the federal 
equal employment opportunity commission charging she was the victim 
of illegal discrimination against women and people of asian descent 
her complaint said her qualifications were equal to or better 
than those of five male faculty members who received more favorable 
treatment 
unanimously rejecting academic freedom arguments the court 
said colleges and universities enjoy no special privilege to 
withhold peer review records used in awarding tenure a lifetime 
appointment penn claimed confidentiality in the tenure process was 
necessary to ensure candor by reviewers 
if there is a smoking gun to be found that demonstrates 
discrimination in tenure decisions it is likely to be tucked away 
in peer review files justice harry blackmun wrote for the court 
sarah burns of the national organization for women legal 
defense and education fund agreed the critical issue is are 
there any smoking guns 
if the university can withhold those documents then the 
university may be able to hide the very evidence that can prove 
discrimination said ms burns 
ms tung who declined to say if she wants to return to penn 
said documents the eeoc sought in her case were obtained by a penn 
grievance commission that determined she was discriminated against 
because of race and sex when she was denied tenure 
penn general counsel shelley green denied that claim there is 
absolutely no finding of discrimination in that report ms green 
said 
it is our hope that faculty members will still participate and 
provide forthright evaluations of candidates for tenure ms 
green said we worry that this will discourage some participation 
we are concerned people will just not be as forthcoming if 
people know there is no confidentiality 
sheldon steinbach of the american council on education which 
along with princeton brown stanford harvard and yale had backed 
penn said the decision could make the tenure review process less 
candid 
the decision may drive portions of the process underground 
for example phone conversations may play a larger role he said 
ms burns said the case involves very core material to 
determine whether there was a principle reason to promote or not 
promote someone 
ms burns also said not all universities guarantee 
confidentiality of reviews to evaluators 
we are thrilled said lorry halloway a washington lawyer 
who represented various organizations opposed to penns 
nondisclosure policy 
had the court ruled otherwise she said proving discrimination 
by an institution of higher learning would have been much more 
difficult thats why this case was so important she said 
we were optimistic but this unanimous decision is 
terrific she said

radical palestinian guerrilla leader 
ahmed jibril said tuesday that western accusations that he 
engineered the bombing of a pan am jumbo jet over scotland were a 
deliberate attempt to blackmail syria 
jibril a former syrian army captain heads the popular front 
for the liberation of palestinegeneral command he was blamed in 
the dec 21 1988 explosion of pan am flight 103 over lockerbie 
that killed 270 people 
we believe that this campaign is aimed at blackmailing syria 
and president hafez assad because the united states and president 
bush believe the time is ripe to settle scores with countries and 
movements hostile to imperialism jibril told a hastily arranged 
news conference in west beirut 
he said the united states and france also hold syria responsible 
for the 1983 suicide truck bombings of the us marine base and 
french paratroop headquarters in beirut that killed 241 us 
servicemen and 58 frenchmen 
but they do not want to face syria outright so they did it 
indirectly by trying to implicate us in the lockerbie bombing 
jibril said 
we say it loud and clear that assad is not a noriega and 
syria is not a banana republic he said referring to last 
months us invasion of panama and the arrest of former dictator 
manuel antonio noriega 
asked if he condemns the lockerbie bombing jibril replied we 
condemn all acts that lead to the killing of civilians and 
innocents 
but by the same token i want to ask hasnt bush in his recent 
attack on panama willfully killed children women and infants an 
estimated 600 panamanian soldiers and civilians died in the us 
invasion as did 23 americans most of them soldiers 
he dismissed as just fabrications reports that his group and 
iran plotted the lockerbie attack together 
jibril and other syrianbacked radical guerrilla groups broke 
ranks with yasser arafats palestine liberation organization over 
plo recognition of israels right to exist 
jibril rejected a call by another breakaway leader kahled 
fahoum for a reunification of all dissident factions with the plo 
we will talk to arafat only when he retracts the concessions 
he has made to israel and the united states he said 
another syrianbacked dissident col saeed mousa also rejected 
fahoums call on tuesday

a mob on tuesday stripped bare the 
threestory green and gray defense force headquarters a hated 
symbol of the power manuel antonio noriega once wielded 
hundreds descended on the complex embracing noriegas former 
office surrounding military barracks and intelligence building 
damaged by heavy fire from us tanks the night of the invasion 
us soldiers watched from a short distance away as panamanians 
tore apart walls with sledge hammers and hauled away window frames 
sheets of plywood footlockers and tin sheets us engineers plan 
to raze the buildings later 
some panamanians built fires in the concrete patio next to cars 
destroyed during the bombing and the fire that followed the dec 20 
invasion 
on one wall in big letters there was a noriega declaration that 
read every man must at one time in his life decide whether he 
dares go for victory risking everything or sit down and watch the 
victors walk by 
on another wall someone had written pineapple face 
coward it referred to a nickname describing noriegas 
pockmarked face 
noriega fled the night of the invasion went into hiding and 
four days later on christmas eve asked for asylum in the vatican 
embassy on jan 3 he surrendered to the us army and was flown to 
miami to face federal drug trafficking charges 
in front of the old building young men approached visitors 
offering old defense forces shoulder patches pictures of noriega 
with other officers letters and other noriega memorabilia 
one opened a large folder and offered a collection of european 
pornographic magazines along with pictures of noriega 
make me an offer for this he said offering the entire 
package 
let them the military pay too said pedro ayala who said 
he had come from a nearby town 
my brother and i lived in el chorrillo he lost everything 
said ricardo aparicio 26 dressed in fatigue pants 
most of el chorrillo a block away from defense forces 
headquarters burned down during the attack 
the boots military used to run everything they ruled not 
now its over aparicio said leaning on a sack of various items 
he and a friend had taken 
we all lost something let them lose something too 
a perspiring friend who identified himself only as fidel dropped 
rolls of copper wire and telephone wire near aparicios sack 
there is nothing left he said people just swept

support solidified tuesday for a us 
task force to stop drug smugglers in the caribbean when the 
countrys largest circulation newspaper said critics are rejecting 
colombias strongest ally in the drug war 
the daily el tiempo said in an editorial that lack of 
information from the american and colombian governments had led to 
misinformation and hysteria 
in a war allies cannot be rejected they must be sought it 
said 
foreign minister julio londono paredes has criticized us plans 
for the task force led by the aircraft carrier john f kennedy to 
increase air and sea patrols in international waters off colombia 
he said monday any type of interference on the high seas 
would need the authorization of the colombian government 
especially of the minister of defense obviously it wouldnt be 
acceptable in national territory 
secretarygeneral german montoya and other government officials 
called londonos position very hardline leading to widespread 
speculation that a rift has developed between the foreign minister 
and president virgilio barco 
londono late monday denied a radio report he planned to resign 
after failing to persuade barco to condemn the us plan according 
to el tiempo 
colombias ambassador to the united states victor mosquera 
chaux said in an interview late monday broadcast by radio caracol 
that the bush administration did not plan to search colombian ships 
without permission from the bogota government 
barco has made no comment about the planned operations 
el tiempo said fears of us intervention in colombia were 
heightened by the us invasion of panama last month 
el tiempos editors wrote a feeling near dread has emerged so 
that at least part of public opinion already hears the stomping of 
marines boots in the streets for this reason we demand more 
explicit information from the colombian and us governments 
it said the news media were responsible for much of the 
misinformation about the us action originally reported as an 
attempt to enter colombian waters and blockade its coast 
us officials said repeatedly any operations will take place in 
international waters 
el tiempo also blamed diehard leftists and juvenile 
minds for contributing to the row the daily which often takes 
prous stands on issues repeated its criticism of the us 
invasion of panama but said the caribbean operations do not pose a 
similar threat to colombia 
it noted that the vienna convention signed by colombia and the 
united states allows ships of either country to stop and search 
vessels suspected of carrying narcotics in international waters 
what the united states is offering is to set up a net of 
vigilance in international waters el tiempo said it is 
incredible that such logical and realistic measures could create a 
psychosis of illegal intervention and invasion 
but maria jimena duzan a columnist for bogotas el espectador 
called the proposed us operation a unilateral act that directly 
assaults colombian national interests 
she said washington was following a failed policy of trying to 
militarize colombia and other south american drugproducing 
countries 
she addressed herself to president bush 
referring to his administrations invasion of panama to capture 
its leader manuel antonio noriega she wrote you used 30000 
troops to invade a country in search of one drug trafficker who 
almost got away 
she said colombia shot and killed a major drug trafficker 
gonzalo rodriguez gacha in an operation carried out by only 15 
men 
the medellin cartel leader died in a dec 15 gunfight with 
police in northern colombia 
in the uraba region of northern colombia seven people were 
killed and three wounded when attackers fired on a house the 
antioquia state government said tuesday 
a communique citing initial police reports indicated the 
killings occurred sunday in necocli 300 miles northwest of bogota 
leftist guerrillas and rightwing death squads are active in 
uraba bordering panama death squads have been blamed for previous 
killings of peasants who work on banana plantations and of union 
leaders who organize them

radical parliamentarians tuesday bowed to 
a warning from irans spiritual leader ayatollah ali khamenei to 
back the government tehran radio said while the opposition 
reported the arrest of a senior cleric critical of the regime 
the lawmakers move appeared to dampen a barrage of criticism of 
president hashemi rafsanjanis policies the last few weeks that 
brought into the open a power struggle between himself and former 
interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia quoted parliament speaker 
mahdi karrubi a key radical as saying today when an excellent 
force is in charge of the executive all of us have a revolutionary 
and religious duty to help him solve the difficulties to the best 
of his ability 
karrubi addressing the 270member majlis or parliament 
stressed we are always ready to cooperate with the government 
and i assure you that any criticism will be entirely to the 
benefit of the islamic order 
the majlis has been debating rafsajanis fiveyear development 
plan which calls for foreign investment to revitalize the economy 
and has yet to approve it 
khamenei who is allied to rafsanjani monday issued a sternly 
worded statement warning after weeks of parliamentary sniping at 
rafsanjanis sixmonthold government that he will not tolerate any 
effort by any individual faction or group to undermine the 
islamic republic 
parliament is dominated by radicals who oppose the policies 
advocated by rafsanjani leader of tehrans more pragmatic faction 
these center on restoring relations with the west and securing 
foreign investment to revitalize the warravaged economy 
hardliners believe foreign involvement will undermine the 
islamic revolution 
khamenei who advocates free enterprise stressed that any act 
or word which shakes the spirit of confidence of the people toward 
the government and authorities and creates even the slightest 
doubt in their support is a national treachery 
khamenei succeeded the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini as 
irans spritual leader following the revolutionary patriarchs 
death june 3 constitutionally he has the last word on questions 
of state and religion 
his warning monday was the second he has issued in two weeks 
pointing to official concern at the increasing attacks on 
rafsanjanis government by the radicals 
khamenei intervened last month after foreign minister ali akbar 
velayati a top rafsanjani aide was summoned to the majlis to 
explain why his ministry had arranged a visit by romanian president 
nicolae ceausescu to tehran in december while his countrymen were 
in revolt and being massacred by his secret police 
khamenei urged parliament to drop the issue and support the 
government at this sensitive juncture but parliament defied him 
and ordered velayati to appear for further questioning 
in mondays warning khamenei said that as supreme leader he 
must be obeyed and that anyone who failed to do so were 
traitors to the revolution and religion 
he said he would punish those who questioned his leadership 
karrubi reassured khamenei tuesday that if the spiritual 
leader considers an issue prudent the majlis will surely abide by 
it and is dutybound to accept it the radio reported 
but the iraqbased mujahedeenkhalq or peoples holy warriors 
reported tuesday that ayatollah husseinali montazeri until last 
year khomeinis designated successor was briefly arrested last 
week for criticizing the president 
in a statement telexed to the associated press from its baghdad 
headquarters the main iranian oppostion group said montazeri was 
seized jan 6 from his house in the holy city of qom but released 
hours later amid mounting tension in the city 
the mujahedeen report could not be independently confirmed but 
violence flared in qom and montazeris home province of isfahan 
last april after khomeini ditched him as heir apparent for 
criticizing his policies 
the mujahedeen report claimed that montazeris criticism of 
rafsanjani and khamenei had been welcomed by other senior clerics 
at odds with the leadership 
last week montazeri branded rafsanjani and his allies 
traitors following reports that israel bought 2 million barrels 
of oil worth 36 million from iran in november in an apparent 
effort to secure the release of israelis held by iranianbacked 
militants in lebanon 
iran denied that but the us state department confirmed the 
deal had taken place

the bush administration should ask the soviet 
union whether bodies or wreckage from korean air lines flight 007 
washed ashore in areas offlimits to us searchers after the 
jetliner was shot down three senators say 
in a letter to secretary of state james a baker iii sens 
nunn dga carl levin dmich and edward kennedy dmass urge 
that a formal request for assistance be submitted to the soviets 
the soviet governments response to such an inquiry would be 
helpful in our efforts to gain as much information as possible 
about the fate of kal 007 the letter said 
a soviet fighter plane shot down the unarmed passenger jetliner 
after it strayed off course and entered soviet airspace on sept 1 
1983 all 269 people aboard including 63 americans were killed 
the cia and the defense department reported that a twomonth 
search failed to locate any wreckage or bodies the letter said 
the pentagon believes most of the wreckage was within 12 miles of 
the coast of moneron island an area the soviets sealed off after 
the crash the letter said 
since us vessels were not permitted to freely search the 
area whee kal 007 was thought to have crashed we request that the 
state department initiate a formal inquiry with soviet government 
officials to determine whether any wreckage or bodies were located 
by soviet search teams or by anyone who might have been permitted 
by soviet authorities into the restricted area around moneron 
island it said 
state department spokesman dave denny said the letter was being 
reviewed 
the letter dated jan 4 and made public by levins office 
tuesday asks that the inquiry be made by wednesday 
levin first proposed asking the soviets for help spokesman 
willie blacklow said he said michigan residents who had relatives 
on the jetliner were pressing to learn more about the tragedy 
theyre very anxious blacklow said president reagan 
promised them an investigation and they havent gotten it 
with the improvement in ussoviet relations the soviets might 
be more forthcoming blacklow said clearly the times have 
changed so perhaps we could get something accomplished now

scientists spent tuesday installing new 
seismic devices on the flanks of redoubt volcano and repairing a 
monitor damaged in an eruption last week schools were closed 
because of an eruption monday 
the mountain remained active but there were no significant 
eruptions following mondays blasts which pushed ash and steam 
eight miles into the air the ash plume turned daylight to darkness 
and blanketed parts of the nearby kenai peninsula with up to 
threequarters of an inch of ash 
in washington state scientists monitoring mount st helens 
detected little seismic activity tuesday but said theyre not 
ready to declare the volcano has returned to its slumber following 
weekend earthquakes 
mount redoubts latest eruption occurred with little warning 
scientists at the alaska volcano observatory said their most 
sensitive monitor was damaged in a violent eruption last week so 
they may have missed the telltale increase in earthquake activity 
which signalled previous eruptions 
unlike previous eruptions there was no dome built up over the 
eruptive vent prior to mondays eruption that prompted scientists 
to warn that similar violent eruptions could continue to occur 
without warning 
the volcano 115 miles southwest of anchorage had been dormant 
for more than two decades before the latest sequence of eruptions 
began dec 13 
mondays ash plume mostly missed the major population 
concentrations around kenai and homer but the grit was heavy 
enough for officials to close schools tuesday in kenai soldotna 
nikiski and sterling 
no deaths or injuries were reported as a result of the volcanic 
activity but air travel and holiday mail have been snarled by the 
almost continuous eruptions 
at mount st helens the weekend earthquakes sent a plume of ash 
90 miles to the east surprising scientists 
it looks quiet right now but i cant say its going to stay 
calm said chris jonientztrisler of the university of washington 
geophysics center in seattle 100 miles north of mount st helens 
it doesnt look at the present time like any eruption is 
imminent she said one thing weve learned though is 
anything can change 
bad weather again prevented flights over the mountain said 
cliff hall an operations staffer with the cascade volcano 
observatory 
were unable to look at whats happened because of the rain 
and wind and clouds hall said 
scientists speculated that steam emissions seen coming from the 
volcano were caused by groundwater reaching superheated rock 
beneath the volcano and turning to steam or from gas released by 
cooling molten rock 
ash expelled by the volcano over the weekend was tested and 
found to be pulverized rock from previous eruptions rather than 
freshly erupted matter 
the volcanos last major eruption occurred on march 19 1982 a 
cataclysmic explosion on may 18 1980 killed 57 people devastated 
230 square miles and sent up an ash cloud that circled the globe

the united states and the soviet union should 
establish an international park astride the bering strait a study 
committee told the two governments tuesday 
certain details of such a park still need more study according 
to an announcement by the interior department of the joint report 
to interior secretary manuel lujan and vg sokolovsky first 
deputy chairman of the state committee for protection of the 
environment 
the committee of officials from both countries did not propose 
boundaries for what land should be protected as parks and said 
each nation should designate appropriate sites and manage them 
under its own laws and regulations 
the national park service the interior department agency whose 
representatives formed the us component of the committee has 
said the 28million acre bering land bridge national preserve 
should be the us park under the arrangement the soviets are 
considering several areas 
the proposal is a shared chance to preserve eskimo and other 
native lifestyles as well as evidence of the rare geological 
archeological and biological heritage of this region 
other recommendations of the committee call for enhanced 
authority for the parks to cooperate with each other and for joint 
research and public information facilities 
the department said it hoped a beringian heritage international 
park can be approved by both governments in time for the 75th 
anniversary of the national park service in 1991 
the bering strait about 50 miles wide separates alaska and the 
siberia region of the soviet union and connects the pacific and 
arctic oceans it is believed the avenue by which north and south 
america were populated by overland migrations from asia in 
prehistoric time when sea levels were lower it is named for vitus 
bering a danish explorer in the service of russia whose voyage 
through the strait in 1728 proved to the modern world that asia and 
north america are not connected by land

the top aide to prime minister yitzhak shamir 
yossi benaharon said tuesday the united states must give israel 
an absolute promise the plo will be excluded if proposed peace 
negotiations are to proceed 
he spoke in reaction to washingtons postponement monday of a 
meeting with israeli and egyptian foreign ministers 
benaharon director general of shamirs office told a news 
conference 
we want a categoric american statement that the plo will not 
be involved in the process 
we feel somewhat uneasy that there is reticence on the part of 
the us government to say clearly that the plo will not be 
involved 
israel says yasser arafats palestine liberation organization is 
a terrorist group and refuses to negotiate with it 
in baghdad iraq on tuesday farouk kadoumi the plos foreign 
minister said the united states was not a fit peace broker because 
it was totally biased toward israel 
egypts foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid said in cairo 
tuesday after a 90minute meeting with arafat that adequate 
preparations should precede the proposed mideast peace negotiations 
he told reporters egypt is eager for establishment of the 
dialogue and to guarantee its success adequate preparations 
should be made we cannot go to a meeting that would result in 
failure 
us officials acknowledged monday that because of unresolved 
differences secretary of state james a baker iii has not invited 
the israeli and egyptian foreign ministers the tripartite meeting 
had been expected to convene this month to set the stage for a 
palestinianisraeli dialogue in cairo on israels proposal for 
elections in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
it is absurd to have a meeting if the meeting produces 
nothing state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said 
monday 
shamir told reporters tuesday during a tour of northern israel 
he was not surprised 
he baker is interested that this meeting bring about 
positive results shamir said 
we have to arrive at an agreement and as long as there is no 
agreement i suppose that the convening of this meeting will be 
postponed 
last friday israeli newspapers published a draft letter from 
baker suggesting that baker was unwilling to meet israels demand 
for rigid guarantees on the plos role and other issues 
benaharon told reporters we are trying to make it absolutely 
clear to our friends in the united states that we are not seeking 
any kind of a cover fig leaf for indirect exchanges contacts 
with the plo we dont want the plo involved in this process 
he rejected a us call that israel rescind its travel ban on 
nine proplo activists from the occupied territories including 
those most active in behindthescenes diplomatic efforts 
benaharon said the restriction was because of violation of 
security regulations and had no connection with the 
palestinians involvement in the peace process 
the state department said monday the ban sends the wrong 
signal to palestinians who favor dialogue as an alternative to 
continued confrontation 
israel tv said shamir and foreign minister moshe arens are not 
ruling out participation of deportees allowed to return to the 
occupied lands 
it said defense minister yitzhak rabin is considering letting 
some deportees return where they could be viewed by shamir and 
arens as residents of the west bank and gaza 
the move would be a compromise with the plo demand that

peru said tuesday it granted diplomatic asylum 
to a top noriega associate who is on the us mostwanted list and 
to 11 others who took refuge in the peruvian ambassadors residence 
in panama city 
us troops have ringed the residence since monday afternoon 
foreign ministry spokesman jose torres told the associated press 
that gonzalo gonzalez identified by panamanian authorities as a 
former captain and chief of security for deposed dictator manuel 
antonio noriega has taken refuge in the residence and been granted 
diplomatic asylum by the peruvian government 
torres said the 12 would be allowed to come to peru if they 
wished but no discussions had taken place thus far about where 
they would go 
it is supposed that they will try to go to some friendly 
country perhaps peru torres said 
if they want to come here we will accept them 
torres denied that another noriega associate former lt col 
luis cordova considered with gonzalez to be the mostwanted men on 
the list of former noriega officials was also at the residence 
panama has said cordova who is alleged to have tortured 
prisoners of the government ousted by noriega also is in the 
ambassadors residence 
foreign minister guillermo larco cox said cordova had sought 
refuge in the residence but peruvian officials refused larco cox 
said cordova was considered unwelcome and left the residence of 
his own will 
larco cox did not say if cordova was apprehended by american 
troops or if he left before they surrounded the residence 
peru listed the others granted asylum as capt marcela tason 
noriegas secretary and her husband ulises rodriguez capt 
narcisa castillero and her daughter patricia ceutte maj 
heraclides sucre his wife daisy batista three children and his 
mother judith medina and maj edgardo lopez 
the government issued a communique tuesday saying peru has 
notified panamanian authorities of its decision granting them 
diplomatic asylum 
peru also released a statement tuesday saying it registered a 
protest with the us ambassador in peru anthony quainton 
concerning the presence of us troops around the ambassadors 
residence it complained the action creates an unnecessary 
climate of tension and impedes the normal development of activities 
of our mission in panama 
the communique condemned the us intervention and called for 
withdrawal of troops 
peru recalled its ambassador to panama mario castro in may 
after noriega annulled elections won by guillermo endara castro 
resigned his post dec 26 in a break with the garcia government 
over its response to the us intervention 
the government has not named a replacement for castro who 
returned to panama monday to collect his belongings from the 
residency 
president alan garcia has roundly criticized the us invasion 
and refused to recognize the endara government 
garcia first said he would not attend next months drug summit 
with president bush in protest but said sunday he would go if us 
troops are first withdrawn 
the summit is scheduled for feb 15 in cartagena colombia 
presidents virgilio barco of colombia and jaime paz zamora of 
bolivia are to meet with bush to discuss strategies to fight the 
drug trade in the united states and south america

the new government said tuesday it 
would seek most favored nation trading status with the united 
states as well as restoration of other privileges and ties 
ousted dictator nicolae ceausescu had renounced the us trade 
agreement in february 1988 when it appeared the us congress 
would not renew it because of human rights abuses by ceausescus 
regime 
the foreign ministry said it was empowered to nullify the 
abusive and unilateral feb 29 1988 declaration of the former 
regime which gave up the granting by the usa of the most favored 
nation clause 
the ministry said a decision monday to lift all travel 
restrictions on romanians paved the way for romania and the united 
states to resume the trade privileges which exempted from some 
customs duties romanian products arriving in the united states 
washington granted the privileges to romania in 1975 when 
ceausescu was courted by the united states as a communist maverick 
they were tied to human rights including free travel and 
emigration under the 35nation helsinki final act 
washington increasingly grew critical of ceausescus suppression 
of free speech religious practice and political organization in 
breaking the accord the dictator said the us pressure on him to 
honor human rights pledges violated the principles of foreign 
relations 
ceausescu was toppled last month in a popular uprising the 
provisional government convicted he and his wife elena of grave 
crimes and executed them dec 25 
romania estimated the lost trade privileges cost it 250 million 
in export revenues from the united states which totaled 775 
million in 1987 the romanians sell wooden furniture small 
engines leather textiles gasoline and aluminium products to the 
united states 
the governing national salvation front also asked for diplomatic 
ties with the european community and membership in international 
satellite organizations 
in brussels belgium a european community commission spokesman 
said the ecs external relations commissioner frans andriessen 
will discuss the request with romanian authorities in bucharest on 
sunday 
romania and albania are the only east european nations with 
which the ec has no diplomatic ties 
the state news agency rompress said the international satellite 
organization intelsat would allow romania to join and that the 
country was trying to join other such organizations 
ceausescu had rejected romanias membership in the organizations 
because he was not interested in linking romania to europe and 
the whole world rompres said 
the news agency also reported that leaders of a 1987 protest of 
the ceausescu dictatorship were allowed to return from internal 
exile 
the leaders were deported to other parts of the country 
following the nov 15 1987 protest in brasov which involved at 
least 10000 people rompres said 74 people returned to the truck 
manufacturing enterprise in brasov but it was not clear how many 
had been banished 
rompres on tuesday also gave details from the trial of a member 
of ceausescus security forces who was sentenced to nine years in 
prison in the first announced conviction resulting from military 
tribunals set up by the interim government 
the defendant identified as ioan bundea a police major in 
sibiu was sentenced in the transylvanian city after being found 
guilty of attempted murder the report said 
rompress said bundea had opened fire on a group of five army 
officers dec 22 battling ceausescu security forces injuring one 
of them 
the report which did not provide further details said other 
such trials were scheduled in sibiu this week 
captured members of security units who battled the army face a 
maximum life sentence

guerrilla war in peru officials said

the lima suburb of san isidro was the first cabinetlevel official 
killed in the escalating guerrilla violence that has claimed the 
lives of hundreds of federal and local officials

blackjack players shouldnt gamble on 
a study indicating that casinos dont shuffle playing cards enough 
for a good mix casino officials and card players said tuesday 
they scoffed at a computer study that shows shuffling a deck 
seven times decreases bettors changes of predicting the next card 
more shuffling means less betting time and casino officials 
said that would have a greater effect on their bottom line 
we have to weigh everything out said howard dreitzer 
senior vice president of casino operations at trump plaza hotel and 
casino if it takes an extra five minutes to shuffle what we 
would lose at the tables 
in november atlantic citys casinos took in about 443 million 
from the blackjack tables about 205 percent of the casinos 
2157 million winnings acccording to the casino control 
commission figures 
most casinos in atlantic city combine eight decks of cards and 
shuffle the whole pack twice by hand to get their mix in 
blackjack players try to get cards totaling as close to 21 as 
possible without going over 
but the two researchers who conducted the computer study said a 
deck needs to be shuffled seven times to prevent astute 
cardwatchers from figuring what the next card might be 
dave bayer a mathemetician and computer scientist at columbia 
university in new york described the seventh shuffle as a mere 
followup to card players nagging doubts that the deck is never 
properly shuffled 
bayer did the study with persi diaconis a statistician and 
mathematician at harvard university in cambridge mass 
fewer shuffles than seven increase the probability that the 
cards are not mixed properly bayer said in a telephone interview 
from new york but shuffling more than seven times does 
increasingly little to improve randomness 
its a recreational math problem but it applies to a whole 
lot of people bayer said people had an intuition that 
something was not right 
dreitzer said his casino is satisfied with two shuffles of eight 
decks 
random is a concept he said laughing at the idea that we 
could shuffle a deck of cards all day if we wanted to 
dave brogan a selfprofessed card counter and the placement 
coordinator for the professional dealers school in atlantic city 
said that even if players were able to master where cards might be 
they would have to have a dealer who shuffled the cards exactly the 
same every time 
ive got dealers that can shuffle the deck twice better than 
others who shuffle it five and six times he said 
bayer credits diaconis also a magician who likes card tricks 
with watching amateur and professional dealers shuffling patterns 
for years to assemble the data that led to the computer study 
bayer said six decks of cards needs to be shuffled 12 times but 
that most casinos dont want to waste time shuffling the cards 
alyce parker a spokeswoman for harrahs marina hotel casino 
said the two shuffles required of dealers at her gaming hall are 
enough to ensure a good mix two makes sure the security 
precautions are there she said 
wayne g marlin a spokesman for the state division of gaming 
enforcement said regulators leave it up to the casinos to 
determine how many times a deck needs to be shuffled to determine 
randomness 
an automatic shuffling machine is under consideration by the 
casino control commission but has yet to be approved said 
commission spokesman tom flynn 
bayer advises amateurs not to bank on his formula 
there are people who can take advantage of nonrandomness 
bayer said but it takes incredible patience and there are better 
ways to make money

a cult leader refused tuesday to return 
voluntarily to ohio and answer charges in the ritualistic slayings 
of a family of five 
jeffrey lundgren 39 his wife alice 38 and their eldest son 
damon 19 all pleaded innocent through their attorneys to ohio 
fugitive complaints triggering formal extradition proceedings that 
could take at least 90 days 
sometimes i wish it wasnt so drawn out but it does work 
eventually said john hewicker a san diego county deputy 
district attorney 
the lundgrens were chained together at the waists as they made 
their first court appearance since their arrests in nearby national 
city on sunday alice lundgren and her son held hands none of them 
spoke during the hearing 
milly durovic the attorney representing jeffrey lundgren 
declined to discuss her clients refusal to return to ohio 
voluntarily 
municipal court judge timothy tower ordered the three held 
without bond 
prosecutors in ohio will have to petition california gov george 
deukmejian for the defendants forced return to stand trial for the 
slayings of dennis and cheryl avery and their three young daughters 
a selfproclaimed prophet lundgren was a lay minister in 
the reorganized church of jesus christ of latter day saints in ohio 
before he was ousted for radical teachings 
he persuaded other members to follow him and the splinter group 
went to live on a farm in kirtland 30 miles east of cleveland 
five bodies were unearthed on the farm last week 
investigators believe the averys were killed in april just 
before lundgren and his followers moved to a farm near holden mo 
cult members had scattered by new years eve when an informant told 
authorities about the slaying 
the lundgrens were arrested outside a motel in national city 
which is about five miles south of san diego by federal bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms agents and police 
three other lundgren children kristen 10 caleb 9 and 
jason 15 also were taken into protective custody and have been 
released to the custody of other family members atf agent scott 
parkhurst said after tuesdays hearing 
federal agents continued looking in southern california for the 
last two of the 13 people indicted in the slayings of the averys 
the 13 who federal and local authorities say belonged to a 
religious cult were charged with aggravated murder kidnapping or 
conspiracy to commit aggravated murder 
lake county ohio prosecutor steven c latourette has said the 
averys apparently were killed as a sacrifice that would cleanse 
cult members souls and allow them to travel to the wilderness 
but dale luffman president of the northeast ohio chapter of the 
reorganized church said the averys may have been killed because of 
disputes over money sex or fear the averys would leave the cult 
the reorganized church based in independence mo has roots 
and some beliefs in common with the salt lake citybased mormon 
church but is separate 
the mormon church is based on revelations that joseph smith said 
were brought to him in the 1820s by a heavenly messenger after 
smiths death in 1844 the church split into factions the largest 
of which is the church of jesus christ of latterday saints 
the reorganized church was founded by smiths son joseph iii and 
claims to be a continuation of the original church 
the church of jesus christ of latterday saints issued a 
statement from its salt lake city headquarters on tuesday 
disassociating itself from lundgren 
jeffrey lundgren and his wife and son have never been 
members of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints said 
bruce l olsen managing director of public communications for the 
mormon church we deplore the tragedy and extend our sympathy to

scientists spent tuesday installing new 
seismic devices on the flanks of redoubt volcano and repairing a 
monitor damaged in an eruption last week schools were closed 
because of an eruption monday 
the mountain remained active but there were no significant 
eruptions ollowing mondays blasts which pushed ash and steam 
eight miles into the air the ash plume turned daylight to darkness 
and blanketed parts of the nearby kenai peninsula with up to 
threequarters of an inch of ash 
in washington state scientists monitoring mount st helens 
detected little seismic activity tuesday but said theyre not 
ready to declare the volcano has returned to its slumber following 
weekend earthquakes 
mount redoubts latest eruption occurred with little warning 
scientists at the alaska volcano observatory said their most 
sensitive monitor was damaged in a violent eruption last week so 
they may have missed the telltale increase in earthquake activity 
which signalled previous eruptions 
unlike previous eruptions there was no dome built up over the 
eruptive vent prior to mondays eruption that prompted scientists 
to warn that similar violent eruptions could continue to occur 
without warning 
the volcano 115 miles southwest of anchorage had been dormant 
for more than two decades before the latest sequence of eruptions 
began dec 13 
mondays ash plume mostly missed the major population 
concentrations around kenai and homer but the grit was heavy 
enough for officials to close schools tuesday in kenai soldotna 
nikiski and sterling 
no deaths or injuries were reported as a result of the volcanic 
activity but air travel and holiday mail have been snarled by the 
almost continuous eruptions 
at mount st helens the weekend earthquakes sent a plume of ash 
90 miles to the east surprising scientists 
it looks quiet right now but i cant say its going to stay 
calm said chris jonientztrisler of the university of washington 
geophysics center in seattle 100 miles north of mount st helens 
it doesnt look at the present time like any eruption is 
imminent she said one thing weve learned though is 
anything can change 
bad weather again prevented flights over the mountain said 
cliff hall an operations staffer with the cascade volcano 
observatory 
were unable to look at whats happened because of the rain 
and wind and clouds hall said 
scientists speculated that steam emissions seen coming from the 
volcano were caused by groundwater reaching superheated rock 
beneath the volcano and turning to steam or from gas released by 
cooling molten rock 
ash expelled by the volcano over the weekend was tested and 
found to be pulverized rock from previous eruptions rather than 
freshly erupted matter 
the volcanos last major eruption occurred on march 19 1982 a 
cataclysmic explosion on may 18 1980 killed 57 people devastated 
230 square miles and sent up an ash cloud that circled the globe

wildlife rescuers wrapped a sling 
around the tail of a 40footlong whale beached in mud and towed it 
back into the gulf of mexico at high tide tuesday 
we got real lucky a surge of water came in just when we 
needed it said pete juneau a state marine biologist if we 
hadnt moved it then we wouldnt have moved it we figured wed 
have to euthanize it 
the animal identified by biologists as a brydes whale was 
freed about 24 hours after it was spotted by oil company employees 
in a helicopter it was stranded in a remote area near an 
industrial area used by shrimpers and offshore oil workers 
the animal lay in as little as 6 inches of water at low tide 
flipping its tail and rocking itself in an apparent effort to get 
to deeper water witnesses said 
after high tide brought in 4 feet of water rescuers wrapped a 
canvas sling around the whales tail and slowly towed it into 
deeper waters it began swimming alongside the boat as rescuers 
removed the sling 
workers kept the whale in sight until it was roughly 3 miles 
offshore said gina barron of the texas marine mammal stranding 
network in galveston 
it looked pretty good said barron summoned to the scene by 
louisiana wildlife officials we stayed with it for quite a 
while we monitored its respiration it was breathing about every 
1 minutes which was good it was swimming strongly and didnt 
appear to have water in its lungs 
shallow water and deep thick mud had hampered the rescue on the 
central louisiana shore in vermilion parish about 20 miles 
southsouthwest of intracoastal city 
its all marsh and real rough you cant walk to it we had 
people try that and they sank up to their waists in mud said 
james manning assistant administrator of the wildlife and 
fisheries fur and refuge division 
wildlife officials observed the animal from aboard a skiff and 
an oil crew boat on the gulf at one time five helicopters with 
reporters and photographers hovered over the whale 
rescuers returned to port tuesday evening hoping their effort 
wasnt in vain 
im not going to say its safe said harry blanchet a 
biologist with the louisiana department of wildife and fisheries 
there has to be a reason it came in in the first place you can 
never tell but ill tell you one thing if it doesnt make it 
youre going to see some grown men cry

an exjunkie who later attended yale university 
was found innocent tuesday of a charge he illegally doled out clean 
needles and syringes to drug addicts to prevent the spread of aids 
jon parker 35 was acquitted after a oneday nonjury trial in 
boston municipal court 
he is founder of a 50member group called the aids brigade 
comprised of former yale graduate students and exaddicts and 
convicts it was formed about five years ago and distributes aids 
education materials bleach and needles in boston new york new 
haven conn and new jersey 
parker testified in his own defense saying the distribution 
program was aimed at saving the lives of drug addicts at risk for 
the deadly acquired immune deficiency syndrome by sharing 
contaminated needles 
i would say that if i could save one life then we should do 
that he said 
parker said before his trial began that he hoped to change a 
requirement for a prescription to buy hypodermic syringes mayor 
raymond flynn endorsed a needle exchange program that was rejected 
by the city council last year 
critics of needle exchange programs say it encourages drug use 
parker was also criticized for being too much of a renegade to 
properly conduct aids prevention 
last year the nations first fullscale governmentsponsored 
needle exchange program to fight the spread of aids was approved by 
the tacomapierce county board of health in tacoma wash 
addicts meet aids brigade workers in dingy restaurants and on 
street corners to get their sets of needles known as works 
among those who testified in support of parkers program were a 
british physician in charge of a needle exchange program in 
liverpool england and a pediatrician from boston city hospital 
who is the mayors adviser on aids 
the adviser dr george lamb warned that within a year the rate 
of aids infection in boston will increase to about 10 out of 100 
people 
dr alan parry of liverpool cited what he said was his programs 
consistent success in aids prevention saying police there carry 
leaflets advertising the program 
parker has said he is uniquely qualified to bring aids 
prevention to the streets because of his background 
he shot heroin as a teenager and robbed drug stores for money 
and supplies at 17 he served time in jail earning a high school 
equivalency diploma behind bars in 1974 a month after his 
release he was caught violating parole and was allowed to check 
into a drug rehabilitation center 
in the years since parker has held a variety of jobs he drove 
a cab and endured a few bouts as a boxer to pay his way through 
hampshire college in amherst he studied biology at hampshire 
college then went to yales school of epidemiology and public 
health

a teenager expelled from a roman catholic high 
school for marrying said tuesday she wants an apology and to be 
readmitted with all student privileges including the right to go 
to the senior prom 
dressed in her school uniform and carrying her books in a 
backpack elizabeth valeri 17 told reporters gathered behind the 
nuns residence at maria high school that she believes her 
expulsion last week may be discriminatory 
i want some kind of apology because i have not been doing 
anything bad she said i want to be accepted back in 
school i want prom i want graduation i want it all 
elizabeth talked to reporters after her new husband xavier 20 
drove her to the residence for tutoring sessions arranged so she 
wont miss exams scheduled at the end of this week the schools 
principal sister grace ann has said the tutoring was being 
provided with the assumption that elizabeth will soon be enrolled 
in another school 
elizabeths attorney robert shindler said later that he sent a 
letter tuesday to the principal threatening a lawsuit unless the 
senior is readmitted and gets the apology she seeks 
i want her back in the school where she has been for the last 
3 years shindler said though he added that hes also trying to 
find another catholic school that might accept elizabeth 
it is up to each school under the umbrella of the roman catholic 
archdiocese of chicago to set policy on married students said 
brother donald p houde an archdiocese spokesman 
the controversy was touched off last week after the bride and 
groom appeared in a picture in the chicago suntimes as the first 
couple to marry in cook county in 1990 she said she was told that 
day that she was being dismissed for breaking school rules 
sister grace ann has said elizabeth was expelled because she 
broke school rules forbidding students to marry 
the principal said tuesday evening that the marriage didnt set 
the right example for other students 
maria high school endorses and encourages the sacrament of 
marriage within the catholic church and by men and women who are 
properly prepared and who have reached the age of majority 
sister grace ann said in a statement marriage outside the church 
and prior to high school graduation while legal does not 
constitute an appropriate example for other students here at 
maria 
she said monday that it would be difficult to discipline married 
students since they theoretically are not responsible to their 
parents anymore but to their spouse 
who do we deal with thats the question sister grace ann 
said 
sister grace ann also said that unwed mothers are allowed to 
return to maria after giving birth partly to help discourage 
abortion 
thats a different lifestyle than a married student sister 
grace ann said this school is a school for single women not a 
school for married women 
shindler said he is seeking a written formal apology for 
the expulsion the notoriety the embarrassment the treatment 
that elizabeth received from the school 
for her tutoring sessions elizabeth has been asked to enter 
through the back door of the nuns residence shindler said 
she is being treated almost like a leper he said 
i didnt do this to hurt anyone and i dont feel that i should 
be treated this way elizabeth said 
she also said her lifestyle has not changed significantly 
because she still will live at her familys house while xavier 
will live at his for a while its just a boyfriendgirlfriend 
relationship she said 
they are rules but are they discriminatory that is the 
question she said 
asked why she didnt wait until after graduation to marry 
elizabeth said why should i wait i am not doing anything wrong 
i just dont feel guilty she said i love him and he 
loves me

about 150 backers of an aids protest group tried 
to block entrances to the federal centers for disease control and 
the street in front of it tuesday charging that the cdc 
underreports aids cases 
about 50 people were arrested said police maj jim wilson he 
said some would be charged with criminal trespass and some with 
damaging government property 
fourteen people who climbed onto a building overhang were 
arrested by dekalb county officers who removed the ladder they had 
used to scale the building 
the group the aids coalition to unleash power or act up 
contends that the cdc where much of the nations aids research is 
done underreports aidsrelated illnesses and does not use a broad 
enough definition of the aids virus 
its far too narrow its out of date said chip rowan a 
protester from atlanta they are seeing it aids in the clinics 
cervical cancer and tb its not news to the people in the clinics 
its news to the people in the cdc 
protesters waved signs reading aids wont wait expand the 
definition and cdc inaccurate inadequate and intolerable 
the group also claimed the cdc gives incomplete information 
about ways the aids virus can be contracted 
cdc spokesman don barretth said the protestors claims were 
incorrectly leveled at the agency he said the cdc has met with act 
up members before and hopes to do so again in a less 
confrontational setting 
a few counterprotesters carried signs reading gay is not ok 
and you dont have to be gay 
one mark weaver executive director of the family association 
of texas accused act up members of strongarm tactics at one 
point he was mobbed by act up members who taunted weaver and his 
supporters 
they want to be heard weaver said after the protestors left 
him but they dont want anyone else to be heard 
in addition to blocking streets and entrances to the cdc complex 
near emory university demonstrators pounded on doors and ran a 
banner up the cdc flagpole dekalb county officers many wearing 
latex gloves did not start making arrests until protesters climbed 
onto the building 
on monday about 300 homosexual activists converged on the 
capitol in atlanta to protest georgias 156yearold sodomy law and 
to urge the repeal of similar laws in other states 
police said 63 people were arrested at that demonstration 
sponsored by the national gay and lesbian task force

a bigger flashier disneyland possibly 
including an indiana jones stunt attraction and a 1930sstyle 
hollywood movie lot are on the drawing boards disney officials 
said in a report published tuesday 
officials are keeping a tight lid on their plans reportedly the 
most ambitious since the parks opening in 1955 until friday when 
disney chairman michael eisner is scheduled to make an announcement 
it involves the next 10 years but i cant tell you anymore 
disneyland spokesman bob roth said in the report published in the 
orange county register obviously he eisner wants to make the 
announcement 
last week disneyland president richard nunis showed the plans 
to several park employees 
the employees said the plans include a stunt attraction based on 
the indiana jones movies that could go near the parks thunder 
mountain railroad ride and the hollywood back lot which apparently 
would be similar to one at floridas disneyworld 
employees said other attractions would be based on the muppet 
characters which disney bought the rights to last year and the 
roger rabbit cartoon character a new muppet movie is also a 
possibility the employees were told 
they said none of this was guaranteed said disney employee 
christy bauer but i got the impression that it was probably 
going to happen because everything was really detailed 
disney has about 78 acres available for expansion in anaheim 
including about 30 acres within the park 
anaheim city manager bob simpson said he hadnt heard of any 
proposed expansion 
weve been talking about expanding disneyland for years he 
said but everybody agrees that nothing can be done until we do 
something about the traffic in the commercialrecreation area

lorne nystrom of shoplifting agreeing with nystrom he was 
absentminded but not dishonest when he failed to pay for two disks 
used to clean contact lenses 
the merchandise was valued at less than 7 
judge brian lennox who heard the case without a jury noted 
that the new democratic deputy from saskatchewan said he 
absentmindedly dropped the cleaner into his pocket and i am

saw nystrom take the disks from a package last nov 29 and that he 
later paid for two toothbrushes but not for the cleaner 
nystrom 43 expressed relief the highly publicized case was 
behind him 
its something i wouldnt wish on anybody he said its 
more horrible than i can even describe because it was so public 
in terms of my friends and my family and my party 
his lawyer clayton ruby has a reputation as one of the highest 
priced criminal lawyers in canada ruby refused to estimate his 
bill but said its not going to be crippling 
nor would ruby estimate the cost of lining up an array of expert 
witnesses some of whom were flown in

many consumers and businesses may see cheaper borrowing costs by 
next month following a longawaited drop in banks prime lending 
rate which fell to the lowest level in 14 months 
the cut to 10 percent from 105 percent effective monday marks 
the first reduction in nearly half a year and reflects the overall 
declining cost of money that banks have enjoyed recently due to 
more liberal credit policies by the federal reserve 
the central bank moved to ease interest rates late last year to 
help forestall a feared economic downturn lower rates spur growth 
by encouraging businesses and consumers to borrow money 
banks use the prime as a benchmark for interest rates on a wide 
range of borrowing by consumers and small and mediumsize 
companies

gov madeleine kunin wants vermont to 
become the first state to ban all disposable diapers but her plan 
is being trashed by some including daycare operators who want no 
part of a mountain of cloth 
the time has come to be responsible and to find the way to say 
yes yes to required statewide recycling to bans on certain 
polluting products to changes in lifestyle kunin said in her 
state of the state speech last week 
only nebraska has banned disposable diapers but it allows the 
sale of diapers that are biodegradable even though such products 
arent believed to break down in the depths of oxygenstarved dumps 
kunin whose proposal would ban disposable diapers by 1993 
noted that while the usable life of a disposable diaper may be a 
few hours they wont decompose in dumps for hundreds of years or 
several generations of babies later

bit by bit and painfully americans began to 
find some techniques for restraining governmentsector debt during 
the past decade meanwhile private sector debt took off 
the latter could become the big financial challenge of the 1990s 
for households farms and businesses for some there are 
indications the bill burden already may be too heavy 
companies bought with debt find themselves strained in a 
weakening economy farmers have seen the price of land collateral 
for their loans decline many households have big mortgages many 
banks have bad real estate loans 
the comptroller of the currency has warned about a growing 
number of tardy consumer loans which include most personal 
automobile and credit card debt earlier the american bankers 
association issued a similar statement 
the matter is being watched by regulatory officials and of 
course by the federal reserve but those who have studied the 
growth attribute it more to changing lifestyles than any specific 
economic cause 
research by the conference board a privatesector research 
group shows privatesector assets of 29 trillion in 1988 after a 
rise of 67 percent a year since 1980 but liabilities rose 10 
percent on average to 74 trillion 
that still left the private sector with a net worth of 21 
trillion but unless the pattern changed in the past year which is 
unlikely net assets are continuing to erode 
the conference board report shows that assets of nonfinancial 
corporations rose 60 percent to 64 trillion from the beginning of 
1980 and the end of 1988 but that liabilities rose 111 percent to 
27 trillion 
those figures brought the corporate liabilitytoasset ratio to 
42 percent in 1988 from 32 percent in 1980 the report said 
interest payments consumed half the corporate pretax dollar in 
1988 against 30 percent in 1980 and 10 percent in the 1960s 
conference board economist eva culen said one danger in such 
ratios is that big interest bills limit corporate flexibility in 
recessions raising the specter of additional unemployment and 
plant closings 
while a proliferation of bank credit cards probably boosted the 
household debt levels in the 1980s the biggest dollar increase was 
in home mortgage debt which rose 30 percent from 1980 as a 
proportion of assets 
the value of houses rose sharply in the decade of the 80s and 
constituted nearly half the total tangible assets of households 
which also include cars land furniture equipment and 
inventories but mortgage debt rose even faster 
regulatory officials have been restrained in their comments but 
they are concerned 
referring to the rising level of delinquency on consumer loans 
comptroller of the currency robert l clarke said this week his 
office was seeking to determine precisely what this implies for 
the overall condition of the national banking system 
the american bankers association said the number of consumers 30 
days or more behind in loan payments soared to a 10year high in 
the third quarter of 1988 delinquences rose to 288 percent from 
23 percent three months earlier 
declining interest rates have taken some of the pressure off 
borrowers but lower rates also reflect a weakening economy that 
eventually could be expressed in terms of rising unemployment and 
shortened workweeks 
meanwhile consumer borrowing appeared to surge during the 
christmas selling season the federal reserve reported this week 
that consumers borrowed 424 billion more than they paid off in 
november 
that increase the biggest rise in outstanding consumer debt in 
nine months was said by some observers to reflect growing consumer 
confidence for some regulators however is was a warning sign

the electronic circus is coming to new orleans 
next week consider some attractions what a dummy the 
people of beverly hills vs zsa zsa gabor monopoly trump 
card tv personals 
a few gameshow revivals also will be there name that 
tune jokers wild and tic tac dough so will a former 
presidential candidates debut in syndicated tv jesse jackson 
voices of america 
these are but a few of the 100 new shows afoot when the 
convention of the national association of television program 
executives starts monday in the big easy the city anticipates 
9000 conventioneers will be on hand for this annual festival of 
showselling to local stations 
but convention officials dont expect a return this year of what 
last year was the big controversy at natpe tabloid tv 
the term refers to syndicated shows like a current affair 
and geraldo which report on and discuss tales of the tawdry 
the unseemly and even the somewhat salacious 
that kind of overwhelmed the whole thing says natpe 
chairman lon c lee vice president and program manager of 
nbcowned kcnctv in denver i dont think youll see that this 
year 
rather he says therell be a lot of discussion about new game 
shows and generally speaking i think youre going to see a much 
broader selection of shows than in the past 
there still will be magazine and socalled information shows 
being offered in syndication to local stations at the convention 
but theyll be of a softer kind than oprah or a current 
affair type of programming one sales executive says 
the new stuff is what i call kinder gentler programming 
explains the executive michael levinton programs vice president 
for blair television a national sales representative for 147 tv 
stations 
one example of what he means would be only yesterday a 
proposed weeknight information series created by former abc news 
executive av westin it would be anchored by john palmer who left 
nbc news last month after 26 years there 
each halfhour episode would be a twopart show the first part 
nostalgia the second a given major story of yesteryear told by a 
person who witnessed it says westin who left abc news last summer 
after 20 years there 
westin now is senior vice president of realitybased programming 
at king world a major company that may make only yesterday 
and syndicates inside edition and such hits as wheel of 
fortune and the oprah winfrey show 
when at abc news westin dispatched 2020 crews to cover one 
natpe convention but this will be the first he ever has attended 
this time hes part of king worlds bid to sign up stations for 
only yesterday 
part of the continuing education of av westin in television 
continues he wryly says the essential difference is at a 
network you could declare you were going to put a program and 
you instantly have 209 stations 
in the world of syndication king world can declare anything 
it wants then its got to go out and sell it to 209 station 
managers 
if one understands that each has his or her own idea on what 
will work in a given market he says then in a way it becomes a 
very fascinating challenge 
westin says he probably wont know until after the weeklong 
convention ends whether only yesterday will go into production 
neither levinton nor natpe chairman lee thinks the costly flop 
of usa today on tv will have an adverse effect on other 
syndicated news and information series being offered next week the 
series was unique in that 156 stations bought it in 1988 without 
seeing a pilot episode 
i think they station executives perceived that this was a 
bad attempt in a category that still is critical to stations 
levinton says 
lee whose station didnt buy usa today on tv jokes that 
station buyers have very short memories they may vow never to 
buy a show without seeing a sample first he says but of course 
well forget that lesson somewhere down the road

michael landon sat on the floor in the tiny 
darkened editing room and watched two key dramatic scenes in the 
nbc movie where pigeons go to die 
on the monitor screen art carney as da lies motionless in a 
hospital bed as his 10yearold grandson played by robert hy 
gorman tells him about the performance of dickens in a 
homingpigeon race the boy is thrilled when his grandfather whos 
had a stroke mumbles a few words 
then the boy watches from hiding as he sees for the first time 
that his own father played by cliff de young loves da as much 
as he does 
its an emotional moment and even the editors whove seen it 
dozens of times watch silently 
landon directed the movie which airs monday and adapted the 
screenplay from the book by r wright campbell he also narrates 
and plays the adult grandson who returns 40 years later to sell his 
grandfathers house and is overwhelmed by memories 
its the first thing landons done since completing the nbc 
series highway to heaven last year after more than 30 years in 
television without a letup bonanza 195973 little house on 
the prairie 197483 and highway to heaven 198489 landon 
took six months off to travel and relax 
i was having dinner one night with melissa sue anderson who 
was on little house and her fiance he said she said shed 
read where pigeons go to die and thought i might like it i did 
and i bought the book it had been around for a while it had once 
been optioned with john wayne in mind for the grandfather 
i loved the simplicity of the story i loved the way the boys 
love of his grandfather is tied in with his pet homing pigeon i 
like the way the narration brings the story together there are no 
bigdeal things going on just some little things like the way 
the boy sees his father shave his grandfather and sees his love 
too 
landon said he felt particularly lucky that he was able to get 
art carney who won an oscar for his role in harry and tonto in 
1974 id always thought of him for the part of the 
grandfather he says hes a lovely guy to work with 
the movie also brings landon together with composer leonard 
rosenman who wrote the score 
he wrote the music for east of eden and ive been humming it 
for 20 years landon said 
landons producer kent mccray and his wife sue mccray his 
casting director sent a recording of the east of eden theme to 
switzerland and had a special music box made landon collects music 
boxes 
the movie was filmed on location in lawrence kan and in 
kansas city 
landon said hes worked so often with animals that he had little 
trouble with the pigeons cat and hawk in the movie he left it up 
to his longtime animal trainer gary gero who went to kansas 
early to get the pigeons acquainted with the area 
a pigeon is not exactly the albert einstein of the animal 
world landon said but gary was able to get them to do some 
remarkable things he set up the big pigeon race where hundreds of 
pigeons competed 
hes extremely kind to the animals i never want any animal 
put in jeopardy and he feels the same way 
landon a former national high school champion javelin thrower 
began his long career as the title character in i was a teenage 
werewolf a number of television roles followed and then he was 
cast as little joe cartwright in bonanza 
he began writing when the show was ready to shut down 
temporarily because it didnt have a script he wrote the script 
over a weekend and later wrote many more episodes and began 
directing on the popular family western he wrote and directed most 
of the episodes of little house on the prairie and highway to 
heaven 
his son michael landon jr played little joes son in a next 
generation bonanza movie hes currently studying at the 
american film institute 
landon has seven grown children two of them adopted he and his 
third wife cindy have two young children last month the family 
moved into a new 10bedroom malibu mansion at the end of a canyon 
about one mile from the ocean 
few people in television have been as productive as landon he 
lists among his hobbies writing scripts even on his sixmonth 
rest when he visited tahiti and hawaii he still did some writing 
and edited highway to heaven for syndication 
at present theres no new series in landons future 
i like working on different projects he said im now 
negotiating to set up my company at a studio ive got a few 
projects in mind but nothing has been signed yet 
i wont say never to another series if something good comes 
along it would be fun to get the crew together again

the nations leading commercial banks dropped their prime 
lending rates a half percentage point to 10 percent marking the 
first reduction in nearly half a year and paving the way for many 
cheaper business and consumer loans 
the move monday reflects the overall falling cost of money that 
banks have enjoyed in recent weeks due to more liberal credit 
policies by the federal reserve 
the central bank moved to ease interest rates late in 1989 to

the number of corporate name changes declined 
last year but 1989 saw the creation of some prominent 
doublebarreled corporate nameplates including time warner inc 
bristolmyers squibb co and bridgestonefirestone inc 
and a man whose name seems to be everywhere got another entry in 
the corporate lexicon as the trump shuttle replaced the eastern 
airlines shuttle 
the number of corporate name changes declined 14 percent last 
year to 1600 from a record 1864 in 1988 according to a survey 
released monday by anspach grossman portugal inc 
nevertheless the 1989 total was the third highest in the 20 
years that the corporate identity consulting firm has conducted its 
annual survey and was almost four times the 422 name changes in 
1980 
mergers and acquisitions were the reason for 799 name changes or 
50 percent of the total reflecting the continued restructuring of 
corporate america in the decades first year only 25 percent of 
name changes stemmed from mergers and acquisitions the firm said 
time inc and warner communications inc made one of the years 
most publicized matches but mergers in the pharmaceutical and 
accounting industries also produced some predictable names 
smithkline beckman corp and beecham group plc got together to 
make smithkline beecham bristolmyers co and squibb co produced 
bristolmyers squibb co and deloitte haskins amp sells and touche 
ross became deloitte amp touche 
while these new names are the result of combining wellknown 
names if history is any guide many of these will later be 
shortened said joel portugal a partner in the consulting firm 
other name changes illustrated the boom in foreign acquisitions 
of us companies stauffer chemical corp became rhonepoulenc 
basic chemicals inc pennwalt was changed to atochem and 
westinghouse elevator was reborn as schindler corp 
but bridgestone corp apparently saw extra mileage in a brand it 
acquired in 1988 it rechristened itself last year as 
bridgestonefirestone inc 
divestitures sales of assets spinoffs and leveraged buyouts 
led to 388 name changes or 24 percent of the total and corporate 
reorganizations and changes to a holding company structure 
accounted for 120 changes or 8 percent 
ramada sold off its hotels and motels and retained its gaming 
operations under the new name of aztar corp nwa inc became wings 
holdings inc after the alfred checchi buyout and fw woolworth 
co streamlined its name to woolworth corp when it became a 
holding company 
another 258 companies or 16 percent of the total changed names 
for reasons other than a merger sale or reorganization among the 
most prominent was gulf amp western inc which restyled itself as 
paramount communications inc 
the greatest number of name changes occurred among manufacturing 
and industrial companies with 464 or 29 percent of the total it 
was the first time in the surveys history that industrial 
companies made more name changes than financial institutions which 
accounted for 366 or 23 percent

it was the heyday of corporate takeovers and two 
businessmen had visions of greatness 
one an australian saw himself atop a global brewing empire 
while the other a canadian expected to become the most powerful 
retailer in the biggest consumer nation in the world the united 
states 
but their dreams clouded their judgment allowing both men to 
delude themselves and ignore obvious signs of trouble today alan 
bond and robert campeau are seeing their businesses slip away 
bond corp holdings ltd with interests in brewing media 
natural resources and real estate around the world has 6 billion 
in debts its australian brewing companies have gone into 
receivership and its american brewer g heileman brewing co of la 
crosse wis has had to cut a deal with its own creditors 
alan bond did manage to win a reprieve last week when an 
australian court turned down a government request to liquidate his 
company but he is still battling banks and receivers 
meanwhile it is widely expected that campeau corps sagging 
us retail divisions allied stores corp and federated department 
stores inc will be forced to seek bankruptcy court protection 
because they cannot make payments on 7 billion in debt held by 
banks and bondholders 
last week robert campeau lost 29 percent of his stock in 
torontobased campeau corp when two of his private companies 
defaulted on bank loans 
to some extent both men were victims of economic circumstances 
interest rates surged in australia taking a toll on bond corps 
business and retail sales slumped in the united states leaving 
campeau corp with little cash to meet its loan payments 
but analysts who have followed the two companies say alan bond 
and robert campeau would never have landed in such trouble if they 
hadnt spent so much on the firms they acquired 
when bond bought heileman for 122 billion in 1987 he wanted 
the company so badly he paid a price that even then analysts said 
was too high heileman already had been losing market share and 
sales for a year 
but when bond launched his bid he had a vision of the future 
which he described in a letter to heileman management 
together bond brewing and heileman would be the fourth largest 
brewer in the world enabling it to exploit markets beyond either 
of our own reaches 
it didnt turn out that way heileman has sold its profitable 
baking division and closed several plants but still has 850 
million in debts and bond corp said recently heilemans cash flow 
was not likely to be enough to make principal payments on its 
longterm debt this year 
heileman is just part of bond corps problems bond has 
conceded that another acquisition of part of the australian firm 
bell group ltd has also resulted in sharp losses 
robert campeau was equally blind to the obvious when the real 
estate developer bought federated for 66 billion in early 1988 
the entire us retailing industry had been in a slump for more 
than a year and no one knew when it would turn around 
but campeau confidently shrugged off questions about whether the 
company could handle its debt if sales didnt recover 
business didnt pick up and federated and allied consistently 
posted losses after they were acquired then last september 
campeau corp exploded a bombshell it could not make the payments 
on some of the highyield junk bonds that it issued to help finance 
its acquisitions 
the news devastated the junk bond market and almost brought the 
takeover business to a standstill 
robert campeau was forced to give up control of his company to 
another canadian developer olympia amp york in return for an 
infusion of cash he was also forced to put federateds 
bloomingdales chain up for sale 
ironically bloomingdaless was the chain upon which campeau 
hoped to build his retail empire 
bond and campeau have both had notoriety in their personal lives 
as well as in their business dealings 
bond is better known than campeau in the united states perhaps 
not by name but by his stunning defeat of san diegan dennis conner 
during the 1983 americas cup race the first time the united 
states had ever lost yachtings biggest prize 
in 1987 when it came time to defend the cup bonds entry 
failed to make it to the finals conner defeated another australian 
yacht and reclaimed the cup 
later that year bond won a battle of a different sort paying 
the highest auction price ever for a work of art he was the 
anonymous bidder who paid 539 million in 1987 for vincent van 
goghs irises 
as it turns out bond went into debt for that acquisition too 
the auction house sothebys recently revealed that it had loaned 
bond 27 million toward the purchase price 
campeau was barely known in the united states even after he 
bought allied in late 1986 it was his twomonth battle for 
federated that won him notice although even after he had defeated 
rh macy amp co inc many americans still didnt know his name 
they did know however that a canadian had bought bloomingdales 
in canada where campeau made his fortune as a developer he is 
quite wellknown as a big partygiver in social circles in toronto 
he has had many friends in the canadian government including the 
popular former prime minister pierre trudeau

us trade representative carla hills says the 
bush administration will push for widescale changes as it enters 
the final year of negotiations aimed at rewriting the rules of 
global trade 
she said monday that eliminating tradedistorting agricultural 
subsidies which are costing billions of dollars worldwide 
remained a top priority but that the farm issue was only one of 
several areas in which the administration is making efforts to 
expand opportunities for us exporters 
i have a political imperative to get reform across the 
board she told a news conference 
the bush administration hopes to use the global trade 
negotiations known as the uruguay round as a way of expanding 
export opportunities for us farmers and businesses and thus 
resume shrinking the countrys trade deficit currently stuck above 
100 billion annually 
the negotiations involving the 96 member countries of the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade are due to conclude in 
december hills said however that she hoped an agreement in at 
least one key area the rules guaranteeing market access can be 
worked out well in advance of the final deadline 
she said that resolution of this topic is possible because 
there is no eastwest or northsouth split between countries 
there are problems for everyone in the package and benefits for 
everyone in the package 
hills also listed a us initiative to write rules covering 
about 1 trillion in annual global trade that is either not now 
protected by gatt rules or for which the current protection is 
inadequate 
she said the united states wanted gatt rules written to protect 
trade in services such as banking and insurance and to strengthen 
protection for intellectual property rights an area in which some 
studies have indicated that us companies are losing between 40 
billion and 60 billion annually because of piracy by foreign 
companies 
these are all areas where american entrepreneurs in the 1990s 
and beyond are going to be supercompetitive hills said 
on the subject of americas huge trade deficit with japan which 
accounts for more than half of the total us imbalance hills gave 
qualified praise for a recently announced japanese package of 
measures aimed at reducing the countrys huge trade surpluses 
the program drawn up by japans ministry of international trade 
and industry features a plan to offer tax incentives that would 
reward japanese companies that increase their imports 10 percent or 
more from the previous years levels 
we will have to wait and see how that tax credit affects the 
behavior of buyers but it shows a certain resolve on the part of 
miti and we are grateful for that hills said 
hills is scheduled to meet in washington this week with her 
japanese counterpart hikaru matsunaga the head of miti who will 
also hold talks with commerce secretary robert mosbacher and 
michael boskin chairman of the presidents council of economic 
advisers

americans took out 424 billion more in 
consumer credit than they retired in november the largest increase 
in their outstanding debt in nine months the federal reserve said 
some analysts said the jump announced monday reflected overall 
consumer optimism despite pockets of sluggishness in the economy 
it presents a clear picture that consumers are back on track 
even if they had slowed down earlier in the year said michael k 
evans of evans economics inc theyre starting to spend again we 
also saw this in the christmas sales which were pretty good 
the fed said consumer credit in november advanced at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 72 percent on top of a 54 
percent gain in october it was the highest level of consumer debt 
since last february when 538 billion was posted 
consumer credit includes all consumer loans except mortgages 
the pace of auto loans slowed to a 22 percent increase or 519 
million on an annual basis reflecting the november slump in the 
automobile industry resulting from an absence of sales incentives 
and the presence of price increases for 1990 models that took 
effect in october 
auto loans increased 41 percent in october but analysts said 
that reflected a lag in credit applications made in september but 
not approved until the following month 
auto sales remained depressed until late december when car 
buyers took advantage of incentives that expired at years end 
consumers didnt like the prices and knew they would come 
down evans said describing the situation in the auto industry 
as a pricing problem not an economic one 
the category of debt that includes credit cards jumped to a 172 
percent annual rate of growth from a 66 percent rate in october 
total revolving debt rose 28 billion compared to 108 billion 
the previous month 
bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose 
133 billion an 8 percent annual rate of growth compared with a 
gain of 117 billion or 71 percent in october 
mobile home debts outstanding fell again down 424 million or 
222 percent the rate of increase in these debts had fallen for 
seven consecutive months until a onemonth gain in september 
the various changes left total consumer debt in november at a 
seasonally adjusted 7118 billion

partners of ivan f boeskys main arbitrage fund 
are getting 248 million in liquidation proceedings but attorneys 
promise to continue pursuing a mountain of lawsuits involving the 
fallen speculator 
more than two dozen shareholder lawsuits and other litigation 
against boesky his defunct partnership cx partners lp and 
affiliated entities are pending in us district court in manhattan 
the agreement between cx partners and its 46 investors was 
reached after more than three years of discussions dating to 
boeskys november 1986 settlement of insider trading charges with 
the securities and exchange commission 
while the agreement is the first major resolution of a boesky 
civil matter it doesnt mean lawyers are ready to settle other 
litigation 
its going fullsteam ahead said david berger a lawyer for 
shareholders in some classaction lawsuits against boesky parties 
we will be proceeding with depositions and preparing to go to 
trial added george reycraft who represents the limited partners 
in the boesky fund 
boesky and the entities he once controlled were inundated with 
lawsuits after federal authorities disclosed his alleged insider 
trading activities most of the lawsuits are by shareholders who 
were selling stock at the time boesky and his associates were 
buying 
also pending in the case that rocked wall street is completion 
of an sec plan to use 50 million paid by boesky to reimburse 
individual investors who can prove they were defrauded by his 
trading 
under the agreement liquidating cx partners formerly known as 
ivan f boesky amp co most of the limited partners received 100 
percent of their investment said david r herwitz the 
partnerships liquidating trustee 
the total equity investment in the fund which boesky formed in 
march 1986 to buy stocks of potential takeover targets was 338 
million its value dropped to 285 million when boesky was charged 
and has since grown to 335 million thanks to interest reycraft 
said 
but boesky and his wife surrendered all their interests in the 
enterprise and some partners did not receive full compensation 
people familiar with the case said the boeskys interest in the 
fund totaled just under 10 million 
the limited partnerships included insurance companies financial 
institutions and individual investors some future disbursements to 
the partnerships are possible herwitz said 
guinness plc the largest holder in the fund with a 100 million 
stake received just 37 million of its claim reycraft said 
mondays settlement included an agreement with drexel burnham 
lambert inc which had an 8 million equity stake in the boesky 
fund and owned 20 million of its debt 
reycraft said drexel received the full 20 million for the debt 
but no interest or any of its equity investment under the 
agreement drexel will be dropped as a defendant in the 
boeskyrelated lawsuits he said 
but reycraft said the limited partners planned to proceed with 
litigation against boesky and others including former drexel 
financier michael milken and admitted securities felons dennis 
levine and martin siegel 
boesky 52 is due to be released in april from a brooklyn 
halfway house where he is completing a threeyear prison term 
boesky pleaded guilty to one count of violating federal securities 
laws and paid 100 million to settle charges he led a network of 
illegal trading using inside information 
the government is using 50 million of the money to compensate 
investors who can prove they were victimized by boeskys trading 
sec officials had set jan 15 target date to establish a plan to 
distibute the money 
we are working toward achieving a plan for distribution of the 
money but that may or may not have anything to do with an 
investors settlement said john h sturc an sec associate 
enforcement director 
herwitz a harvard law professor said he expected some of the 
lawsuits consolidated before us district judge milton pollack to 
be resolved soon 
some of these lawsuits will be reduced abated or limited 
herwitz said part of what is happening is people are going to 
try to save a dollar or two on litgation costs

share on jan 8 and sold them for 39 a share on jan 11 1988 
the day the emhart offer was made public 
according to the sec pencikowski agreed to disgorge 10847 in

a burning issue behind the strike against 
eastern airlines the transfer of some eastern assets to parent 
texas air corp is now the subject of negotiations that could 
result in compensation being paid to eastern 
the special examiner in easterns bankruptcy proceeding has been 
holding talks that could lead to restitution by texas air for 
assets that could amount to millions of dollars sources said 
monday 
attorney david i shapiro the examiner appointed by the federal 
bankruptcy court noted in a document submitted recently to the 
court that he has negotiated with eastern on a possible settlement 
related to the transferred assets which include planes routes and 
other crucial segments of an airline operation shapiro declined to 
comment on the matter monday as did texas air spokesman art kent 
in houston 
but sources familiar with the talks who asked not to be 
identified said the discussions were continuing 
the unions representing pilots ground workers and flight 
attendants who struck eastern last march 4 have long accused 
texas air chairman frank lorenzo of siphoning off valuable eastern 
assets to its sister carrier continental airlines and to texas 
air the unions have demanded that a special trustee be appointed 
to run miamibased eastern replacing lorenzo and top management 
the strike virtually shut down eastern and forced it to seek 
chapter 11 bankruptcy protection march 9 eastern pilots and flight 
attendants abandoned their sympathy walkouts shortly before 
thanksgiving but the machinists union remains on strike 
a union advocate charged monday that a financial settlement 
wouldnt be adequate to compensate eastern for assets that he said 
lorenzo stripped from the airline 
it is not a sufficient cure for that simply to pay some 
bucks said bruce simon an attorney for the air line pilots 
association there should be a trustee 
shapiro a washington attorney has been conducting an extensive 
financial investigation of texas air eastern and continental since 
early september shapiro and more than 20 associates have been 
interviewing current and former officers of the companies union 
leaders and others 
shapiro is looking into past transactions between texas air and 
its two main subsidiaries they include the transfer of the system 
one computerized reservation system from eastern to texas air in 
april 1987 for about 100 million 
if the examiners investigation found that price to be 
inadequate for example he might ask texas air to pay eastern the 
difference between what it already paid for system one and a fair 
market price the sources said 
shapiro has told the court his inquiry has shown there may be a 
conflict of interest stemming from eastern and continental having 
the same owner he recently said the key question is whether 
lorenzo has been treating the three companies as one airline last 
month shapiro said he and his staff had interviewed about 70 
people and examined more than 200000 documents 
eastern has complained that the investigations objectivity has 
been compromised because a large part of the work has been 
delegated to easterns unions 
we may pursue it further eastern spokesman robin matell 
said monday referring to the complaints he declined to comment 
however on the issue of negotiations with shapiro on a possible 
settlement 
shapiro recently said he has received a list of complaints from 
easterns attorneys that contend the investigation has been almost 
prosecutorial the examiner said the magnitude of the task has led 
him to delegate some work such as interviews to union attorneys 
but that practice hasnt hurt objectivity 
after having received several extensions shapiro is scheduled 
to report on his investigation to us bankruptcy judge burton r 
lifland in new york on feb 15 a hearing on the trustee issue also 
is scheduled for that day

ual corp has instructed its financial adviser to 
explore the merits of recapitalizing the airline company a move 
that could mean flying with a heavy debt load and increasing 
internal turbulence 
the move monday came under pressure from coniston partners a 
new york investment concern that owns 118 percent of uals stock 
and has threatened to make a run at taking control of the companys 
board of directors 
under this threat coniston said it wanted the company 
recapitalized if there was no revised buyout proposal put together 
by monday 
ual the parent of united airlines issued a statement after the 
close of markets monday saying that no employee ownership plan 
has been put forth 
it said company directors told their financial adviser first 
boston corp to come up with a proposal for the next ual board 
meeting on jan 25 
ual said in its statement that among the proposals it wants 
studied is a plan that would involve an exchange offer of ual 
debt securities for a significant portion of uals outstanding 
stock 
ual spokesman rob doughty would not say how many of the 21 
million outstanding shares might be involved in any 
recapitalization nor would he expand in any other way on the 
companys brief statement 
there was no immediate response from the pilots union which led 
earlier attempts to put together an employee buyout but the union 
as well as ual chairman stephen wolf has been known to oppose 
recapitalization partly because of the extra debt it might entail 
wolf reportedly told the pilots union that he might resign if 
the company was forced to recapitalize 
three years ago the airline went through a recapitalization 
that added about 3 billion in debt however within a few years 
this was cut in half with surplus revenue and proceeds from sales 
of nonairline businesses 
over the past year takeover talk has taken the chicagobased 
company for a bumpy ride 
a pilotmanagement plan to buy the company for 675 billion or 
300 a share failed last fall when banks refused to finance it 
since then the value of a share of the companys stock has been 
nearly cut in half 
last month coniston said it was dissatisfied with progress 
being made toward a sale or restructuring of the company 
it said that if there was no sale and if a recapitalization 
proved unsatisfactory it might revive its threat to seek 
shareholder consent to oust 13 of uals 15 directors and take 
control of the board 
officials of the investment concern could not be reached for 
comment on uals decision to explore recapitalization there was no 
answer at conistons new york office late monday 
ual said that if the board approves a recapitalization it would 
be implemented as promptly as practicable thereafter 
the statement said the board remains open to any appropriate 
acquisition proposal from employees or any other party 
ual stock traded as high as 294 a share amid the buying frenzy 
that followed the plotmanagement groups offer last summer 
the stock closed monday on the new york stock exchange at 
15662 down 287

jvc has developed a method for recording 
highquality digital sound on vhs videotapes a company official 
said today which should allow future super vhs machines to match 
or surpass compact disc players in sound quality 
digital sound is the wave of the future so we have developed 
a digital audio recording method for vhs the official said 
digital recording allows greater dynamic range and lower noise 
levels than conventional analog methods 
current vhs videocassette recorders use frequency modulation 
fm a nondigital method to record highfidelity sound the new 
machines will record both fm and digital audio making the tapes 
and equipment compatible with earlier vhs machines jvc said 
prototypes using the new technology have been developed but no 
date has been set for marketing said the official speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the price is expected to be higher than for current super vhs 
equipment super vhs introduced in 1987 uses special tapes and 
circuitry to provide higherquality pictures than normal vhs 
currently vhs machines record video and fm audio signals on two 
different layers of the videotapes magnetic coating in a technique 
called depth multiplexing the digital sound information will be 
recorded on the same layer as the fm signal jvc said 
the company whose formal name is victor co of japan is the 
original developer of the vhs format and a member of the matsushita 
group which makes panasonic and technics products 
the jvc official said the new technology would allow direct 
recordings from other digital sources such as satellite broadcasts 
japans public broadcasting network the japan broadcasting corp 
nhk broadcasts television programs with digital sound directly 
from a stationary satellite 
however direct digital recordings from compact discs will not 
be possible without an adapter 
the company said it expects a wide range of applications for the 
new technology from general consumer goods to professional 
equipment

continental airlines says it will offer oneway 
tickets to and from texas cities for as low as 9 to fill seats 
that otherwise would go empty 
the airline said response was brisk and at least two other 
carriers were considering today whether to follow the low fare lead 
its a whole lot more productive to put somebody in a seat at 
9 or 19 than to have that seat go empty said john nelson 
continentals executive vice president of marketing 
the announcement monday came just days after continental 
announced it was raising fares by 4 percent 
dubbed texsavers the new fares are good on tuesday and 
wednesday for travel between all texas cities continental serves 
except el paso and for travel between houston and new orleans 
oklahoma city and tulsa 
the fares are expected to increase the houstonbased carriers 
revenue by about 3 million to 4 million a month nelson said 
the lowest fare available 9 oneway will be for travel from 
houston on tuesdays and wednesdays to new orleans and throughout 
texas except el paso nelson said the cost for travel between 
oklahoma city and tulsa from houston is 19 one way and the cost 
for texas flights involving el paso is 39 one way 
travel on the thursdaythroughmonday flights from houston to 
new orleans and throughout texas except el paso is 19 oneway 24 
oneway for oklahoma city and tulsa oneway fare between el paso 
and another texas city is 49 
unrestricted fares are marked at 39 59 and 79 
the new fares require a 21day advance purchase are 
nonrefundable and are subject to availability nelson said 5000 
seats a day on 112 flights have been earmarked for the new fares 
we are having one of the busiest nights ever in texas 
continental spokesman ned walker said monday night calls are 
coming in from consumers for these fares the phones are ringing 
off the wall no ones ever seen fares like this in texas 
he said the new fares are effective indefinitely problems with 
booking the low fares after the first twoday period resulted from 
some of the other carriers having a minor glitch in loading fare 
information into computers 
that will be resolved in the next two days said walker 
these fares are real 
southwest airlines a nofrills regional carrier based in 
dallas may be the competitor most affected by the fare cuts the 
majority of southwests business comes from connecting texas cities 
with each other and surrounding states 
southwest is considering the fares but has not decided whether 
it will match the cuts said spokesman david brown officials at 
fort worthbased american airlines also said they were studying the 
reductions 
we were deluged with calls from travel agents the agents said 
that they were not able to book the 9 fares after the first 
tuesdaywednesday period said brown 
i am not saying that it the continental announcement is a 
sham and only for two days but it is highly unusual that a 
carrier would make this kind of an announcement and then have those 
flights only available for that limited a period he said 
southwest last week lowered fares for people over 65 putting a 
79 cap on oneway fares although some are as low as 19 on dec 
19 southwest put a 99 cap on oneway advancepurchase fares 
the new rates come a week after the airline announced a 4 
percent increase in fares across the country due to higher fuel 
costs 
nelson said continental a subsidiary of houstonbased texas air 
inc is implementing the new fares to encourage travelers to fly 
instead of drive on their next trip 
eastern airlines continentals sister carrier last week 
announced fare cuts of up to 45 percent to 65 cities and eliminated 
the usual cancellation penalties 
eastern said monday it also was raising some fares 4 percent to 
help cover fuel costs but its new discount fares are exempt from 
the increase 
continental and eastern are the main subsidiaries of 
houstonbased texas air corp the nations largest airline company

the soviet union today proposed that the 
comecon trading bloc begin trading on a hard currency basis at 
world prices next year to end four decades of isolation from the 
world economy 
the proposal came on the first day of a private meeting of 
soviet and eastern european leaders joined by leaders of mongolia 
vietnam and cuba east european leaders welcomed the idea but said 
it should be implemented slowly 
comecon officials who briefed reporters after the session said 
the soviets suggested hard currency trading at world market prices 
begin in 1991 replacing trading in the nonconvertible soviet 
ruble 
members of the 10nation sovietled trading bloc founded in 
1949 have agreed that a radical overhaul is needed if the group is 
to survive and keep pace with changes under way in eastern europe 
where democracy is taking hold and members are abandoning central 
planning 
vladimir dlouhy a reform communist who chairs czechoslovakias 
state planning commission told reporters the soviet proposal would 
be a disaster if introduced immediately and said a transitional 
period is essential 
polands noncommunist premier tadeusz mazowiecki said the 
transition period for fuels and raw materials should run until 
1995 other trade should be carried out on the basis of bilateral 
agreements mazowiecki said 
moscows east european allies traditionally have relied on 
soviet raw materials as their chief source of fuel and raw supplies 
for their industries 
todays meeting was the first since last months ouster and 
execution of romanian dictator nicolae ceausescu and the decline of 
communist power elsewhere in europe 
comecon is an obsolete organization it has never worked and 
doesnt work now romanias interim premier petre roman said 
monday comecon must adjust and change if it is to continue 
soviet prime minister nikolai ryzhkov told reporters after an 
initial closeddoor session there is no danger of comecon 
falling apart 
his assessment of the future of the 10nation group was 
partially shared by czechoslovak finance minister vaclav klaus who 
told reporters comecon will survive in one form or another 
klaus has warned that his country would unilaterally cancel its 
comecon commitments unless its transactions are based no longer on 
the soviet ruble but on a convertible currency that can be freely 
exchanged on the world market 
that view is shared by romanias new leaders who have closed 
ranks with hungarys reformers and polands solidarityled 
government in calling for an end to trade based on fixed quotas and 
prices barter and the ruble 
founded in 1949 comecon the council for mutual economic 
assistance provided josef stalins soviet union with a mechanism 
for extracting favorable trade agreements from client states 
fortyone years later the soviet union under mikhail s 
gorbachev has cut loose warsaw pact states it once kept in the fold 
by force and comecon will thus crumble if the trade relationships 
within it are not reforged 
trade relationships within comecon had been based on agreements 
between stateowned industries in centrally planned economies that 
did not work comecon must now either adjust to the dismantling of 
such economic systems already well under way in poland and 
hungary or perish 
the meetings agenda included coordination of economic plans for 
the next five years which would at the outset create a conflict 
ryzhkov has presented an orthodox centrally planned program for 
the next five years for the soviet union while most east european 
countries are abandoning central planning in favor of the free 
market 
critics say the trade bloc has recently been nothing more than a 
means for its member states to survive the freemarket evils of an 
increasingly competitive world economic system 
the bloc has not been held together by socialist solidarity 
they say but by members inability to earn enough hard currency to 
buy energy and raw materials from anywhere but the soviet union 
now all that is changing as east bloc countries led by hungary 
embark on extensive trade with the west 
hungary announced last week it would cut its exports to the 
soviet union by 20 percent czechoslovakia and poland last week 
decided to establish bilateral trade agreements and link their 
currencies the crown and zloty bypassing the ruble

bristolmyers squibb co today announced it is 
taking two fourthquarter charges that will total about 690 
million after taxes as it continues the process of blending two big 
pharmaceutical companies 
the larger charge an estimated 740 million before taxes will 
be taken as part of a plan to integrate newly merged businesses and 
reorganize on a worldwide basis 
it will cover the costs of reducing the number of plants and 
employment levels it also will be used to pay for employee 
relocations and related expenses the company said in a news 
release a company spokesman said a small percentage of the work 
force will be cut but exact numbers were not yet known 
there will be an additional fourthquarter charge of 115 
million for the costs of professional fees and other expenses 
related to last years merger of the formerly separate companies 
bristolmyers and squibb 
the union was completed in october after stockholders approved 
an 115 billion taxfree stock swap between the two companies 
creating the second largest pharmaceutical concern behind merck amp 
co 
the two charges will reduce aftertax income by about 690 
million the company estimated 
financial results for the fourth quarter which ended dec 31 
are due to be released later this month company spokesman dan 
mcintyre said he couldnt say whether the charges would cause 
bristolmyers squibb to report a loss for the fourth quarter 
the two predecessor companies had combined profit of 11 
billion or 210 a share through three quarters of 1989 that was 
up 144 percent from 9615 million or 183 a share in the first 
nine months of 1988 combined sales totaled 68 billion up 65 
percent from 64 billion in 1988 
chairman richard l gelb said bristolmyers squibb is on the way 
to realizing the benefits of the merger that was announced in july 
he said the coordination of sales and marketing activities and 
the performance of the combined pharmaceutical research and 
development effort promised to fulfill the business opportunities 
that were anticipated

a nineweek strike by workers at a plant owned by 
british aerospace plc will force airbus industrie to shut down its 
production lines in the coming days the head of the european 
commercial aircraft consortium said tuesday 
jean pierson predicted that thousands of workers at plants in 
britain france spain and west germany will be laid off 
temporarily because of the strike at the british aerospace plant at 
chester england which makes wings for the airbus family of 
commercial jets 
pierson meanwhile also announced that airbus had record sales 
in 1989 of 421 aircraft worth a total of 34 billion 
pierson said the consortium already has cut back the rate of 
production of its a320 shorttomedium range jet to 12 a month 
from a peak of seven a month in early november if this hadnt been 
done the assembly line at toulouse in southwest france would have 
been shut down at the end of november he said 
pierson told a press conference that if he had known the british 
aerospace strike would last so long he would have shut down the 
assembly line sooner 
the british aerospace workers are striking over their demands 
for a 35hour work week british aerospace management is refusing 
to negotiate until the strikers go back to work 
the standard work week for manual workers at british aerospace 
is 39 hours but they work on average an extra six hours a week in 
overtime to meet production schedules 
airbus industries chief executive criticized management for 
allowing the strike to drag on 
part of the art of good management is in being able to handle 
labor relations he said 
pierson said problems created by the strike will tarnish the 
consortiums credibility as well as have financial repercussions 
for the airbus partners aerospatiale of france 
messerschmittboelkowblohm gmbh of west germany british aerospace 
plc and construcciones aeronauticas sa of spain 
airbus industrie currently has four a320s and a similar number 
of widerbodied a310s on its production lines at toulouse even if 
the strike ends now he said the consortium faces two months 
without any new wing assemblies 
the situation could have consequences for airbuss market share 
pierson said noting that customers are being told they will have 
to wait longer before taking delivery 
pierson acknowledged that 1989 was an exceptional year for the 
commercial aircraft industry and predicted that the rhythm of new 
orders would moderate in 1990 
he said the consortium expects to take in orders for between 270 
and 300 planes in 1990 well up from the 167 aircraft sold in 1988 
stuart iddles senior vicepresident for the groups commercial 
operations said it was difficult to get a clear picture of the 
market prospects for 1990 because of uncertainties over the 
startup of programs at mcdonnell douglas corp and boeing 
commercial aircraft corp in the united states 
but he said it was likely that airbus industrie would be able to 
expand its market share to close to 30 percent in 1990 from 225 
percent in 1989 and 16 percent in 1988 boeing was the only other 
manufacturer with a bigger market share last year 
airbus industries 1989 revenue was approximately 5 billion 
pierson said adding that the consortium showed its firstever 
profit from financial operations of 60 million 
the airbus chief executive confirmed that an independent report 
commissioned by the consortium recommended the final assembly of 
the a320 narrowbodied shorttomedium airliner should remain at 
toulouse in southwest france 
this could put an end to a yearlong controversy over west 
germanys efforts to get the a320 production line transferred to 
hamburg 
the airbus supervisory board has requested supplementary 
information from the reports authors and the issue will be 
decided when the board meets on jan 26 in toulouse

american consumers believe mercedes and kodak 
stand for top quality although volvo drivers are more loyal to 
their cars a study of brand perceptions says 
coke and pepsi are dead even in terms of perceived quality but 
the pepsi generation seems more satisfied with its cola and while 
toyota owners are among the most loyal of any brandname devotees 
the average american feels that buick offers more quality 
total research corp a princeton njbased market research 
firm surveyed consumers age 15 and older in 1000 households for 
their attitudes on 91 brands in categories ranging from cars to 
candy bars 
the study of brand recognition and quality perception also 
known as brand equity found that campbell soup was the most 
recognized brand with 98 percent of those surveyed having some 
feeling about campbell 
hallmark greeting cards and mcdonalds restaurants followed 
closely with 97 percent recognition 
mercedes and kodak topped the list of perceived quality with an 
average rating of 84 from consumers with a feeling about the 
brands the ratings are on a scale ranging from zero for poor or 
unacceptable quality to 100 equals extraordinary quality 
other brands rating at or above 80 in perceived quality included 
fisherprice toys hallmark levis jeans and ibm personal 
computers 
but in the rank of perceived quality among users of a given 
brand volvo came out on top with a rating of 98 topping mercedes 
at 94 
the survey also indicated strongly polarized views about toyota 
the japanese carmaker came in third in quality ranking among brand 
users with a rating of 93 but among consumers who recognize the 
brands buick had a higher perceived quality rating than toyota 69 
to 66 
among other conclusions total research said consumer response 
toward advil showed strong growth potential with a quality 
perception among users of the pain reliever higher than quality 
perceptions among consumers who recognize the brand 
other brands with a similar growth profile included volvo espn 
sports cable network estee lauder and revlon cosmetics american 
express fuji film and magnavox 
kelloggs corn flakes showed the classic signs of a declining 
brand highly recognized but average in perceived quality and 
lowly rated in user satisfaction others showing a declining 
profile included nestles crunch sears stores holiday inns blue 
crossblue shield insurance schick razors and lipton soup 
coke and pepsi both made the top 10 of most recognized brands 
but pepsi drinkers gave their cola a quality rating of 88 while 
cocacola drinkers rated their brand slightly lower at 85 
the survey also found that consumers still love international 
business machines even if stock market investors dont ibm 
personal computers ranked second behind kodak in terms of 
consistency of consumers quality ranking 
at the other end of the scale mtv the music cable channel had 
the least consistent quality ranking as well as the lowest quality

grain futures prices closed lower and soybeans 
were higher tuesday in quiet trading on the chicago board of trade 
as weakness in the wheat market spilled over into other markets 
the action in the wheat pit was disappointing the soviet union 
did not reappear in the market after making an overnight purchase 
of 480000 metric tons of wheat said analyst dale gustafson of 
drexel burnham lambert inc in chicago 
the national weather services six to 10day forecast released 
monday also dragged down wheat prices the forecast called for 
improved chances of rain in hard red winter wheat growing areas 
gustafson said the weak tone of wheat spilled over into the rest 
of the market 
corn prices fell due to slack demand with analysts noting that 
commercial houses were on both sides of the market and for small 
amounts 
soybean futures were higher as the transportation problems 
created by decembers cold weather cleared up a lack of additional 
export business and overnight selling by farmers weighed on prices 
analysts said 
at the close wheat was 1 cents to 3 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in march at 407 a bushel corn was a cent 
lower to a cent higher with march at 238 a bushel oats were a 
cent to 1 cents lower with march at 150 a bushel soybeans

paramount communications inc said tuesday its 
fiscal fourthquarter profit jumped nearly ninefold to 123 
billion reflecting gains from the 3 billion sale of its financial 
services unit to ford motor co 
earnings also rose for the entire fiscal year which ended oct 
31 as the box office success of movies like indiana jones and 
the last crusade helped offset the cost of an unsucessful bid for 
time inc 
paramount which changed its name from gulf amp western inc in 
june said pershare net income for the final quarter was 1028 
that compared with earnings of 1440 million or 112 per share 
the same time a year ago 
fourth quarter revenue rose to 9688 million from 9356 
million 
paramount said the quarterly results included a 12 billion 
gain from the sale of associates first capital corp the nations 
thirdlargest independent finance company to ford for 335 
billion and 2794 million of earnings from the units operations 
for the year paramount earned 147 billion or 1221 a share 
on revenue of 34 billion that was nearly four times higher than 
the previous years net income of 3845 million or 321 per 
share on 31 billion in revenue 
the annual results reflected a 483 million aftertax charge 
for costs incurred in paramounts failed bid for time which has 
since merged with warner communications inc and an 843 million 
charge from publishing operations for the adoption of new 
accounting procedures 
they also included a onetime gain of 74 million from the sale 
of two small units of the publishing subsidiary prentice hall 
paramount chairman martin s davis said fiscal 1989 was a 
transition year 
we completed the restructuring we launched in 1983 and emerged 
as a strong communications company with operations solely in 
entertainment and publishing he said in a statement 
armed with substantial cash and significant borrowing capacity 
we have the financial strength to fuel the global growth of our 
businesses he said 
davis said paramount recorded its secondbest operating income 
in fiscal 1989 due to the popularity of movies such as indiana 
jones and the last crusade and the naked gun from the files of 
police squad in us markets and coming to america the 
accused and crocodile dundee ii in foreign markets 
theater operations posted increased operating income primarily 
reflecting a gain froom the january 1988 sale to warner of 50 
percent of the companys domestic theater circuits 
television operations declined modestly reflecting an expected 
decrease in series syndication income compared with fiscal 1988 
which included the availability of webster in domestic 
syndication 
publishing operations excluding the charge posted lower 
results as modest gains in higher education school and 
international operations were more than offset by declines in 
consumer and supplementary education publishing and profesional 
information 
consumer publishing posted lower operating income due to higher 
expenses despite brisk sales of such paperback best sellers as 
rock star by jackie collins and its always something by 
gilda radner 
the madison square garden unit suffered declining operating 
income due partly to the closing of the facility for renovations 
last summer

restructuring costs at control data corp for 
1989 will surpass 650 million when an expected 210 million charge 
is booked for the fourth quarter the computer company said monday 
lawrence perlman control datas president and chief executive 
officer said the writeoffs will lead to a loss in the fourth 
quarter adding to the net loss of 484 million in the first nine 
months of 1989 exact results will be announced at the end of this 
month 
about half of the expected fourthquarter charge of 210 million 
will stem from vtc inc a small computerchip subsidiary that has 
never been profitable in its fiveyear history said nancy foltz a 
company spokeswoman control data said it expects to sell 
bloomingtonbased vtc this year 
the subsidiary which employs about 400 people produces 
computer chips for several highsecurity government computers 
other fourthquarter charges stem from foreign currency 
adjustments from the sale or discontinuation of some overseas 
holdings and the writing down of some intangible assets the 
company said 
previous writeoffs were due largely to the shutdown in the 
second quarter of control datas supercomputer subsidiary eta 
systems and the streamlining of the companys mainframe computer 
business those moves cost the company 476 million 
but the restructuring costs in the second and fourth quarters 
will be offset by a restructuring gain of 189 million booked in 
the first quarter from the sale of assets and the settlement of a 
lawsuit 
in the third quarter the sale of the companys disk drive 
subsidiary imprimis resulted in a restructuring gain of 85 
million after sale proceeds of 337 million were offset by charges 
of 252 million 
perlman also control datas banks have agreed to waive the 
effect of some of the fourthquarter charges so that the company 
can meet the net worth test specified in its credit agreement the 
agreement defines specific quarterly operating earnings the company 
must meet 
perlman said control data expects operating profits in the 
fourth quarter to improve from the thirdquarter level of about 
206 million but he did not give specifics 
since 1984 control data has been hit with 14 billion in 
writeoffs the company managed a net profit of 17 million in 
1988 and 19 million in 1987 but lost a total of 832 million in 
1986 and 1985

the maker of sanka acknowledged tuesday that a 
national ad appearing to show an impromptu taste test for the 
decaffeinated coffee was really staged with actors mouthing 
prepared lines 
general foods usa said it will alter its ad following an 
agreement with a massachusetts state official who criticized the ad 
as misleading 
viewers have come to expect that participants in any taste 
test are real consumers stating their honest opinions and not paid 
actors extolling the product with comment supplied to them by the 
advertiser said mary ann walsh the states secretary of 
consumer affairs and business regulation 
the ads which air nationally will have the word 
dramatization superimposed at the bottom of the screen for 
three seconds as the commercial begins according to the agreement 
between walsh and general foods 
we really do not think that any changes in the commercial are 
required either by testimonial guidelines or for the protection of 
the consumer said general foods spokesman cliff sessions but 
in a spirit of cooperation we are adding the caption and to avoid 
any possibility of viewer confusion 
set in a new jersey railroad station at 714 am the 
commercial features people stopping at a table set up with sanka 
cups and containers 
this is great says one person what is this others 
add delicious you know this smells really good says 
another no way this isnt sanka 
federal guidelines apply to commercials that identify the person 
approving the product or those which make competitive claims 
sessions said sessions said the sanka ad does neither 
general foods young and rubicam the companys advertising 
agency and all three networks approved the ad before it aired 
sessions said 
general foods is located in white plains ny and parent 
company philip morris cos is based in new york city as is young 
and rubicam nevertheless walsh took on the food company because 
the ads air frequently in massachusetts she said 
walshs office phoned the federal trade commissions local 
office about the case but continued to negotiate with general 
foods on its own 
bill mcdonough a staff attorney for the ftcs regional office 
in boston said action by state officials on a case often can 
preclude federal involvement 
we feel as long as somebody does it thats the main thing if 
we found a state has acted and there is action by the advertiser 
it wouldnt be necessary for us to act mcdonough said 
the ads have been running for about six weeks sessions declined 
to comment on how long the campaign would continue

the dollar started out sharply higher amid concerns that ethnic 
unrest in some of the soviet unions republics would force mikhail

but it moved off its highs for the day on profittaking and 
other technical factors he said 
the dollar is often seen as a safe haven for investors in times 
of political instability

by the west german central bank president karl otto poehl that 
there would be no further realignment of exchange rates within 
european currencies 
italy devalued the lira on friday within the european monetary 
system and traders said more realignments would have further

georgiapacific corp asked a federal 
judge tuesday to cut the number of votes needed to fire directors 
of great northern nekoosa corp in the proxy battle between the 
rival paper companies 
great northern has resisted georgiapacifics unsolicited 38 
billion tender offer saying it is illegal on antitrust grounds 
atlantabased georgiapacific has said the great northern board 
should be fired because its members are trying to protect their own 
highpaying jobs at the expense of shareholders 
georgiapacific chairman t marshall hahn jr said in court 
papers that the rival companysboard provisions are manifestly 
designed to insulate incumbent directors from the wishes of the 
companys shareholders 
georgiapacific asked us district judge gene carter to reduce 
the number of shares needed to oust the great northern board from 
threefourths to twothirds georgiapacific contends that great 
northern is in violation of maine corporate law by requiring the 
higher number 
stephen hill a spokesman for great northern which is based in 
norwalk conn but incorporated in maine said the latest 
georgiapacific filing has no merit 
materials filed with the motion included a list of 16 potential 
candidates that georgiapacific would like to see on great 
northerns board 10 of whom are georgiapacific executives 
hill said great northern would issue a proxy statement soon 
that will tell our side of the story 
georgiapacific previously had solicited shareholders to call a

massachusetts highest court ruled tuesday that 
the courts and not the state should decide whether a subsidiary of 
firemans fund insurance cos can sell insurance in massachusetts 
the complex case stemmed from a 1987 decision by firemans fund 
to withdraw from massachusetts primarily because of concerns over 
sagging auto insurance profits 
that move came without prior notice firemans fund allowed its 
massachusetts insurance license to expire and it also withdrew from 
the commonwealth automobile reinsurers the highrisk pool for auto 
insurance 
the state insurance division advised firemans fund it could not 
unilaterally abandon the massachusetts market on less than one 
days notice and filed suit in superior court 
on nov 13 1987 firemans fund the auto insurance pool and 
the state insurance division signed a settlement agreement that 
ended the suit filed by the state and a countersuit filed by the 
insurance company 
the insurance commissioner said at the time that firemans fund 
could not return to massachusetts without state approval and the 
company did not dispute that point supreme judicial court justice 
ruth abrams said in tuesdays decision 
the settlement also contained language that said firemans fund 
would stop selling insurance in the state and provided for a 45 
million payment to the insurance pool 
following the settlement firemans fund dismantled its 
massachusetts operation 
but on sept 29 1988 a wholly owned subsidiary national 
surety corp a party to the settlement agreement bought warner 
insurance co an illinois insurance corporation licensed in 
massachusetts to write most insurance but not auto policies 
after a hearing the insurance division revoked warners 
license contending the purchase violated the settlement agreement 
the insurance company appealed and argued that the superior 
court was the proper forum for the dispute to be resolved the 
supreme judicial court agreed 
the insurance statutes do not give the commissioner authority 
to make a binding interpretation of a contract to which he is a 
party or to determine conclusively whether the other party has 
violated that contract abrams wrote 
the supreme judicial court sent the case to the superior court 
for further action 
abrams said if there was no violation the revocation of 
warners license was not proper if there was a violation she 
said the superior court might conclude that a proper remedy would 
be for either firemans fund to sell warner or for the revocation 
of warners license to stand

three years after officials of time inc and 
warner communications inc first talked about combining their 
businesses the two companies are sealing their 14 billion merger 
and forming the worlds largest media concern 
but the time warner inc that will be created when the deal 
officially closes wednesday is vastly different from the company 
time chairman j richard munro and warner chairman steven j ross 
once envisioned 
time warner is expected to have 114 billion in revenue this 
year putting it ahead of the west german firm bertelsmann ag as 
the worlds biggest media company 
but the new company will be burdened with nearly 11 billion in 
debt mostly as a result of the merger which supplanted time and 
warners initial plans for a debtfree stock swap 
its high leverage is expected to put a crimp in some of time 
warners plans 
it would have been a hell of a company if they didnt have all 
the debt said fred anschel an analyst with dean witter reynolds 
inc 
peter appert an analyst with cj lawrencemorgan grenfell 
said the debt load makes timewarner a more risky proposition in 
a slowing economic environment particularly if interest rates move 
up 
analysts predict time warner earnings will be depressed for at 
least two years while it reduces its debt but they generally 
expect the company ultimately to flourish 
although appert was concerned about the companys debt he also 
said i think the company will do quite well 
said anschel the businesses theyre in are strong 
cashproducing businesses and timewarner should be able to pay 
down its debt as long as it remains wellmanaged 
warner brings properties that include its highlysuccessful 
warner bros film and television studios warner bros and atlantic 
records divisions warner cable business and its publishing arm 
which includes warner books and dc comics 
times main businesses are magazine publishing including time 
sports illustrated and people magazines book publishing 
including timelife books inc and bookofthemonth club inc and 
cable television including home box office inc and american 
television and communications corp 
last march time and warner announced that after two years of 
onagain offagain talks they would merge in an exchange of stock 
but on june 6 less than three weeks before shareholders were to 
vote on the merger paramount communications inc launched a 107 
billion hostile offer for time 
the bid later raised to 12 billion forced time and warner to 
transform their stockswap deal into a 14 billion tender offer by 
time for its wouldbe partner paramount also took time and warner 
to court in delaware in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the 
timewarner combination 
on july 24 the delaware supreme court upheld a lower court 
ruling allowing the merger to proceed times tender offer expired 
hours later and in the socalled front end of the offer time paid 
70 in cash for about half of warners 200 million outstanding 
shares 
time also changed its name then to time warner inc but warner 
communications remained a separate entity pending wednesdays 
closing of the deal at the closing warner shareholders were to be 
issued securities for the balance of their holdings and warner 
stock was to be delisted from the new york stock exchange at the 
end of the day 
munro and ross will serve as cochairmen and cochief executive 
officers of the merged company after both eventually retire nj 
nicholas jr time warners president is expected to head time 
warner 
many observers have questioned whether the twochairman idea can 
work especially with the strong personalities involved munro and 
ross say that since they negotiated the deal and weathered the 
paramount storm together they can run the company sidebyside 
anschel predicted that at least for a couple of years its 
going to work unless something comes up where they start 
disagreeing 
but there are likely to be few rough spots right now anschel 
said because munro ross and nicholas agree that the first 
priority is to reduce their debt 
to some observers a big uncertainty is the price of time warner 
stock during its fight against paramount time asked shareholders 
to reject the 200 a share cash offered in the paramount bid and 
profit in the longterm as time warner stock rises 
analysts expected the stock which closed at 11675 a share 
tuesday on the new york stock exchange to rise but it may take 
some time 
if they demonstrate that theyre making progress in terms of 
cash flow and debt reduction i think the stock will rise 
gradually said dean witters anschel 
appert also said he expected the stock to make money over time 
but not in the near term

energy futures prices climbed tuesday on the new york mercantile 
exchange in trading that saw heating oil prices swing wildly before 
finishing with a modest gain 
on other markets soybeans were higher while grains fell 
livestock futures were mostly lower and pork futures mixed and 
precious metals were mixed 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 16 cents to 45 cents 
higher with the contract for delivery in february at 2207 cents a 
barrel heating oil was 45 cent to 72 cent higher with february 
at 6505 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 1 cent to 24 cents 
higher with february at 6088 cents a gallon 
analyst bob baker of prudential bache securities inc in new 
york said heating oil futures were up about 250 points before 
turning negative and then closing with a modest gain 
meanwhile gasoline prices climbed steadily to post a strong 
gain 
baker attributed the volatility in the heating oil market to 
speculative trading and the entrance of bargain hunters 
expectaions that the american petroleum institutes weekly 
inventory data would show a decline in distillate and gasoline 
stocks helped boost prices 
after the close of trading the api released data showing 
gasoline stocks were down 64 million barrels and distillate stocks 
down 423000 barrels crude oil stocks were up 418000 barrels 
tuesdays trading reversed three days of selling spurred by 
easing concern over cold weather and reports opec production surged 
beyond the levels set last year by the cartel 
grain futures prices closed lower and soybeans were higher in 
quiet trading on the chicago board of trade 
the action in the wheat pit was disappointing because the soviet 
union did not reappear in the market after making an overnight 
purchase of 480000 metric tons of wheat said analyst dale 
gustafson of drexel burnham lambert inc in chicago 
the national weather services six to 10day forecast released 
monday also dragged down wheat prices the forecast called for 
improved chances of rain in hard red winter wheat growing areas 
corn prices fell due to slack demand with analysts noting that 
commercial houses were on both sides of the market and for small 
amounts 
soybean futures were higher as the transportation problems 
created by decembers cold weather cleared up a lack of additional 
export business and overnight selling by farmers weighed on prices 
analysts said 
wheat was 1 cents to 3 cents lower with march at 406 a 
bushel corn was 1 cent lower to a cent higher with march at 
238 a bushel oats were a cent to 1 cents lower with march at 
149 a bushel soybeans were cent lower to 2 cents higher with 
january at 570 a bushel 
livestock futures were mostly lower and pork futures were mixed 
on the chicago board of trade 
weaker wholesale prices and lower cash prices put pressure on 
cattle futures according to analyst tom morgan of research corp 
in arlington heights ill 
pork belly futures continued the rally that began last week when 
the us agriculture department issued a quarterly hogs and pigs 
tally that showed far fewer animals than traders expected 
live cattle were 05 cent to 20 cent lower with february at 
7647 cents a pound feeder cattle were 25 cent lower to 15 cent 
higher with january at 8465 cents a pound hogs were 32 cent 
lower to 10 cent higher with feburary at 5130 cents a pound 
frozen pork bellies were 10 cent to 90 cent higher with february 
at 5560 cents a pound 
precious metals futures were mixed on new yorks commodity 
exchange 
gold traded in a narrow range before finishing higher as the 
value of the dollar showed signs of weakening said analyst craig 
sloane of smith barney harris upham amp co in new york silver 
declined in sluggish trading 
gold was 120 higher with february at 40620 a troy ounce 
silver was 1 cent to 16 cents lower with march at 5298 a troy

mexico and its creditor banks are on the 
brink of completing a debt renegotiation that will allow the 
country to resume growth after years of stagnation mexicos top 
debt negotiator said 
its like an aircraft at the end of the runway you move your 
flaps youre committed angel gurria said 
gurria assistant treasury secretary for international financial 
affairs said more than 98 percent of nearly 600 commercial banks 
have signed on to the debt renegotiation package terms of which 
were agreed upon last july 
the package should be ready for a formal signing before the end 
of the month said william r rhodes the citibank banker who has 
led bank creditors in the negotiations 
the renegotiation would cut 75 billion from mexicos 485 
billion commercial bank debt and knock nearly 2 billion from the 
countrys annual interest bill of 9 billion 
were less than 1 billion away from actually having all the 
money there committed gurria said in an interview last week with 
the associated press of the 1 billion we know where 800 
million stands 
mexico is the first country to renegotiate its debt since 
treasury secretary nicholas brady outlined a new us policy 
offering to forgive some debt if countries make serious efforts to 
reform their economies 
under mexicos package creditor banks have three options 
forgiving 35 percent of the principal of their loans leaving 
principal intact but reducing the interest rate to 625 percent 
below market levels or providing new loans equal to 25 percent of 
the banks existing loans to mexico 
gurria said 42 percent of the banks have agreed to the principal 
reduction 48 percent will lower interest rates and the remaining 
10 percent will provide new loans 
the number of banks opting for the third option is lower than 
negotiators had hoped as a result mexico and the banks are about 
300 million short of the money needed to guarantee repayment of 
debts a key part of the plan according to a banker involved in 
the negotiations who requested anonymity that gap wont delay the 
completion of the package though he said 
a 300 million shortfall is manageable the banker said 
gurria said completion of the package requires formal approval 
by boards and committees of some creditor banks 
the creditor banks still have a couple of weeks to study the 
documents before signing them he said 
mexicos 96 billion foreign debt which includes debts to 
foreign governments is the secondlargest among developing nations 
after brazils 110 billion brazil has not paid interest on its 
debt for months 
mexican officials have said the agreement will allow mexico to 
pay 27 percent of its gross national product to service foreign 
debt instead of the 63 percent it has paid out in recent years 
agreement on the terms of the renegotiation last july was a key 
to restoring confidence in the mexican economy which grew 3 
percent last year after seven years of recession or stagnation 
inflation was held to 197 percent in 1989 down from 159 percent 
in 1987

the dow jones average of 30 industrials fell 2837 to 276600

japans top trade official on tuesday disputed the 
perception that japanese markets are closed to foreign business and 
blamed the united states high budget deficit and low savings rate 
for worsening for the nations trade problems 
the openness of the japanese manufacturing market is 
comparable with the united states already said hikaru matsunaga 
minister of international trade and industry 
us industry and government officials contend that access to 
japans market is limited severely and is a key contributor to the 
us trade deficit 
the japanese government last month outlined a package of tax 
incentives tariff eliminations and other measures that officials 
said was aimed at reversing past trade policies and making japan an 
importing powerhouse in the 1990s 
japans ministry of international trade and industry expects to 
the measures to eliminate discrepancies between the costs of 
products in japan and abroad make the japanese distribution system 
more efficient and lead to the breakdown of the keiretsu 
system in which many japanese companies are clustered in tightly 
knit groups 
all of those issues are on the table in the usjapan 
negotiations to deal with such alleged structural impediments 
to trade 
matsunaga said in a speech to business leaders that japans 
imports of manufactured goods already had increased 39 percent in 
1988 and imports from the united states grew 34 percent 
i hope that the facts of this rapid increase in japans 
imports are understood and will inspire foreign businesses to 
challenge the expanding japanese market which in fact holds 
immense potential benefits for them he said through an 
interpreter 
matsunaga visited dallas before heading to washington where he 
will meet with government trade officials including us trade 
representative carla hills and commerce secretary robert mosbacher 
matsunaga attributed much of the us trade deficit to 
macroeconomic policies including low savings incentives and 
the budget deficit 
i am expecting to see the united states making efforts to cut 
its budget deficit and strengthen its industrial competitiveness 
and to enhance supply capacity he said im sure that measures 
to raise the savings rate would be extremely beneficial 
the bush administration is considering a proposal for providing 
tax breaks on savings the high japanese rate of savings often is 
cited as a factor in that nations relatively cheap supply of 
capital 
matsunaga who described japan as a free market also criticized 
what he said is an increasing move toward protectionist policies in 
the west he said he is especially concerned that europe will 
become a closed market in 1992 when internal trade barriers within 
the common market are eliminated

mcdonnell douglas corps md11 a new 
widebody jetliner based on the dc10 is scheduled to make its 
maiden flight wednesday six months behind schedule but with the 
aerospace giants hopes flying high 
the first test flight of the md11 the first new trijet 
introduced since mcdonnell douglas dc10 and lockheed l1011 two 
decades ago will take place only if weather is clear at long beach 
airport 
the 350passenger md11 is just one of several aircraft programs 
on which the st louisbased aerospace and defense company has run 
behind schedule including the 150passenger md80 jetliner and the 
c17 military cargo plane 
many of mcdonnell douglas problems stem from the worldwide boom 
in commercial aircraft orders which also has overtaxed production 
at rival boeing co 
the md11 is quite important to mcdonnell douglas said 
lawrence harris and aerospace analyst with the bateman eichler 
hill richards brokerage in los angeles 
the successful certification of the md11 will generate a 
significant portion of douglas revenues over the next several 
years he said 
the company has 118 orders and 194 options for md11s which 
harris said will cost about 90 million each under the most 
optimistic schedule the company could have the plane tested 
approved and 10 jets delivered by the end of the year he said but 
that is unlikely 
the maximum nonstop range for the standard md11 is up to 8039 
statute miles with 323 passengers and bags 
the planes include the quieter more energy efficient 
highbypass engines made by general electric co rolls royce and 
pratt amp whitney customers will be able to choose the engine maker 
the engines on the plane to be tested wednesday were made by ge 
the md11 is about as long as twothirds of a football field 
and several companies have expressed interest in a stretch version 
that would be 35 feet longer about the size of a boeing 747 no 
decision has been made on whether to produce the longer version 
spokesman keith takahashi said tuesday from the companys douglas 
aircraft division in long beach where the plane is made 
the md11 looks much the same from the outside as the dc10 
although minor streamlining changes have been made in the tail the 
end of the wings and the stabilizers the avionics cockpit and 
interior are new 
it will compete against the a330 and a340 jetliners being 
manufactured by the european consortium airbus industrie which 
also carry about 350 passengers and cost about the same boeings 
777 to be introduced in the mid1990s will also compete with the 
md11s 
mcdonnell douglas is counting on the douglas unit to generate 
profit growth in the years ahead because of the likelihood of a 
flattening defense budget and the significant commercial backlog 
that exists for both the md80 and the md11 said harris the 
bateman eichler analyst 
he said 1990 would be a transitional year for mcdonnell douglas 
whose earnings fell during the first nine months of fiscal 1989 
its still an open question as to how many md11s can be 
delivered and the bottom line will be affected by development 
expense which could rise if test flights reveal serious 
problems harris said 
the program for the smaller md80 appears to have turned the 
corner into profitability he said 
meanwhile the c17 program is still in development amid close 
scrutiny the air force recently moved the first flight of the c17 
fron the end of this year to mid1991
