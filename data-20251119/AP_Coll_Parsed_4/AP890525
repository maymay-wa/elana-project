communist party chief zhao ziyang and another 
leading liberal were placed in custody as hardliners moved to 
stifle political opposition and end massive demonstrations for 
democracy sources said friday 
communist party and east european sources said wan li the head 
of chinas legislature who also is associated with the liberal 
camp was detained in shanghai after returning from a trip to the 
united states 
the reports which could not be officially confirmed further 
supported recent indications that party hardliners led by senior 
leader deng xiaoping and premier li peng have taken command in the 
current power struggle 
there also have been signs in the official media that 
conservatives have been winning the battle for control of china 
most recently an appearance by li on nationwide television in which 
he defended his martial law crackdown in beijing 
sources said zhao one of the architects of chinas economic 
reforms was stripped of power and was under house arrest his 
movements were being restricted 
a foreign ministry spokeswoman insisted thursday that zhao was 
still the party general secretary but he has not been seen or 
heard from since may 20 when premier li declared martial law in 
beijing and ordered troops to restore order in the capital 
a government source also said president yang shangkun a deng 
ally delivered a speech thursday that strongly criticized zhao for 
his activities during the current prodemocracy student movement 
that triggered the political crisis 
yang speaking to members of the party politburo retired 
revolutionary leaders and beijing delegates of the national 
peoples congress or legislature said zhaos actions had a very 
bad effect on the nation 
yang said zhao added to the disturbances with his actions which 
included expressing sympathy for the goals of the students and 
guaranteeing the students would not face reprisals 
students initially were calling for a dialogue with the 
government to discuss corruption and sweeping political changes 
since martial law was declared they have demanded the ouster of 
premier li and deng 
a day before martial law was declared zhao and li went to 
studentoccupied tiananmen square to talk to students on a hunger 
strike for democratic reform 
but whereas li left after a few minutes zhao with tears in his 
eyes made an impassioned speech calling for conciliation between 
the government and the students 
yang also said the peoples liberation army prevented from 
entering beijing by tens of thousands of citizens who have blocked 
roads and set up barricades would eventually move in to assume 
military control of the streets 
but he said the army would stay out for the time being in 
order not to worsen the situation 
the 81yearold president also indicated that communist party 
members who have participated in the popular uprising will be 
punished 
the government will continue to acknowledge that the student 
movement is patriotic he said but as for the others they were 
controlled by a small band and will be suppressed 
thousands of party members from staterun news organizations 
research institutes ministries and factories have joined the 
demonstrations many have joined the common call for the 
resignations of premier li and deng 
two sources said national peoples congress chairman wan li was 
being held in shanghai after being prevented from returning to 
beijing on thursday 
while in canada and the united states wan had praised the 
students as leading a patriotic movement and urged a peaceful 
resolution to the standoff between the government and the students 
he cut short his trip and returned to china early thursday the 
official chinese press said he was staying in shanghai for 
medical treatment 
sources said the fate of hu qili who recently was reported to 
have backed zhao was less clear some said he was under house 
arrest others said only that it appeared he was in trouble hu in 
addition to sitting on the politburo standing committee is in 
charge of propaganda work in the party 
premier li made his first public appearance thursday since 
declaring martial law six days ago 
appearing confident and relaxed at a welcoming ceremony for 
three new ambassadors li said that anyone with common sense 
should realize the army could enter beijing if it wanted to 
but our government is a peoples government and our army is a 
peoples army staterun television news showed li telling the 
ambassadors from mexico burma and liberia 
he said the troops would enter the city after citizens 
understood the reason for the martial law order he did not 
elaborate 
more than 100000 workers and intellectuals meanwhile defied 
lis martial law crackdown for the second time this week and 
marched thursday in a sea of banners calling for freedom and the 
resignation of li and deng 
in another sign that zhao had lost out to li staterun radio 
reported that 27 out of 29 provinces have backed the martial law 
order already six out of chinas seven military regions have 
expressed support for the crackdown only the beijing military area 
has been silent 
a shrill letter published in all major newspapers and broadcast 
on the radio and television thursday further indicated that the 
military was closing ranks around li 
the letter by the army headquarters of general staff and general 
political department strongly supported lis hardline position 
if we let their plot succeed then the results of 10 years of 
struggle to reform china will be for naught it said 
the protests are the biggest spontaneous political movement in 
communist chinas 40year history lis hardline stance apparently 
reflects the views of deng who has tried to reduce central 
controls of chinas economy but refuses to relax tight political 
control 
troops remained poised on beijings outskirts thursday but none 
have openly entered the central districts hundreds of thousands of 
citizens surrounded their trucks and threw barricades across 
streets to keep them out after days of standoff most of the 
troops pulled into military and other compounds 
a circular from the state council chinas cabinet said 
students forced their way onto trains to beijing hindering efforts 
to end turmoil in the capital and disrupting rail operations tens 
of thousands of students have poured into the city over the past 
few weeks from as far away as kasgar near chinas northwestern 
border 
the state council also sent a letter to troops expressing hope 
they will overcome the difficulties confronting them and 
successfully impose martial law 
under government regulations foreign reporters are banned from 
conducting interviews on the street and in schools government 
offices factories and other places 
in washington the state department said the voice of america 
added two chinese language frequencies to compensate partially for 
three frequencies that chinese authorities began jamming monday 
staterun media said chinas red cross urgent appealed for 
students to leave tiananmen square to avoid deteriorating health 
conditions there

young afrikaners have begun 
questioning their role as apartheids heirs 
in recent months the first antiapartheid newspaper published 
in afrikaans has doubled its circulation to 8000 and provided 
publicity for a new wave of alternative culture 
three antiestablishment afrikaner rock bands have been drawing 
enthusiastic crowds at campuses and theaters during an 
unprecedented nationwide tour 
the movement is small as yet 
most afrikaner children grow up in tightknit conservative 
families and attend rigid state schools where curriculum is 
tailored to fit government ideology young white men must serve two 
years in the military prolonging the period in which they are 
screened from other ways of thinking 
afrikaners have a very authoritarian tradition children are 
meant to be seen and not heard said max du preez editor of the 
7monthold newspaper vrye weekblad free weekly this has 
retarded the growth of young people were all late bloomers 
du preezs newspaper is aimed both at readers who already have 
broken with apartheid and at those who still condone the concept of 
whiteminority rule under the national party government 
we have a converting role a responsibility to stimulate 
afrikaners who are on the verge of breaking away and to provide a 
new home for them du preez 37 said in an interview its 
been a very lonely place to be to be an afrikaner who has broken 
with apartheid 
it doesnt seem lonely at the boisterous concerts of the voelvry 
free bird rock n roll tour which succeeded despite being 
banned from several places one of the touring groups is called die 
swart gevaar the black menace and is a phrase used in 
describing whites fears o a black majority takeover 
dirk uys manager of another group called the gereformeerde 
blues band told one music writer were bringing home a lot of 
those homeless people who have never been able to identify with the 
current state of afrikaans culture 
says the leader of the blues band johannes kerkorrel if you 
can make a language into rock n roll it cant be an oppressive 
language any more 
along with the alternative music movement is an upsurge in 
provocative topical afrikaans drama with new works surfacing 
regularly from universitybased playwrights 
this radical school of dramatists challenges and even 
undermines the principles and mores on which afrikanerdom is 
based said the weekly mail an englishlanguage antiapartheid 
newspaper 
about 60 percent of south africas 5 million whites are 
afrikaners descendants of dutch and other european settlers who 
began arriving here 337 years ago only in 1948 did the afrikaners 
take full control of the government and they proceeded to enact 
the harsh segregation laws of apartheid force millions of blacks 
from their homes and suppress campaigns for black rights 
small numbers of afrikaners have opposed apartheid since the 
1960s and their ranks have grown since the widespread black unrest 
of 198486 but most remain opposed to black majority rule and 
uninterested in learning about other political perspectives 
mike joubert who last year was president of the student council 
at the university of pretoria said most of the 22000 students at 
the afrikaanslanguage school were preoccupied with academics and 
social life and had a very strong antipathy toward any kind of 
political activity 
they were very uninformed said joubert a nephew of foreign 
minister pik botha they accept anything they read or see on 
television 
only a few hundred students were active in either leftwing or 
rightwing political groups said joubert who is now in business 
school many of the others might accept major political reforms but 
would need to be led in that direction he said 
at the university of stellenbosch the most prestigious 
afrikaans university a slightly more liberal mood prevails a ban 
on the voelvry tour provoked emotional protests and there was 
widespread support for a group of 18 students who went to zambia in 
april to participate in forums that included members of the 
outlawed african national congress guerrilla movement 
the dutch reformed church by far the largest afrikaner 
denomination has suffered fewer defections of young people than 
major protestant churches in the west according to dr pierre 
roussouw a senior church official 
he said more than 90 percent of the youths who are baptized by 
the church complete the process that leads to adult membership 
services at university chapels are packed he said 
there are victims of secularization and were worried about 
that he said but we have much to be thankful for 
one of the factors behind the churchs strength said roussouw 
is christian national education the education system at white 
public schools that promotes afrikaner nationalism 
calvinistoriented bible study and a whiteoriented view of 
history 
the dutch reformed church has repudiated its former endorsement 
of apartheid but roussouw said it would never abandon its support 
of christian national education 
we sometimes underestimate the power of the school system 
said du preez its a very potent force the history courses 
the language bible study praying for the president raising the 
flag 
most afrikaners in their 20s and 30s sense that black majority 
rule is inevitable du preez said but they have deep worries and 
uncertainties about how that change will affect them 
i feel so sad as i look at my people theyre the most unfree 
people in this country he said theyre resented by everybody 
else theyre angry and afraid and confused

rob lowes attorneys were trying to reach a 
settlement with a teenagers mother who sued the actor after her 
daughter appeared in a sexually explicit home video with the brat 
pack star court documents show 
the attorneys also denied that lowe tried to seduce the girl 
who was 16 at the time 
the papers unsealed wednesday also contend that the teenager 
planned to blackmail the actor with the videotape showing her 
having sex with him and include affidavits from friends of lena 
jan parsons of marietta that say the teenager bragged about having 
sex with the 24yearold actor last summer 
the documents say the girl intended to use the videotape to 
extort 2 million from lowe 
the affidavits had been filed in superior court in cobb county 
in connection with the divorce of miss parsons parents 
lowe asked the court to dismiss the civil lawsuit that lena 
arlene wilson filed may 12 on grounds that she lacked standing to 
sue since she no longer had legal custody of her daughter after her 
divorce 
a hearing on the motion is scheduled for june 13 
in one document dated march 30 lowes lawyer edgar neely iii 
said he asked to view the videotape for the purpose of providing 
me with sufficient information to advise my client in an attempt to 
reach a compromise settlement of ms wilsons claims prior to the 
initiation of formal litigation 
fulton district attorney lewis slaton has said he is looking 
into the possibility of charging lowe with exploitation of a minor 
a document filed in support of lowes dismissal motion said 
the plaintiffs complaint does not allege and mr lowe 
specifically denies that he induced plaintiffs daughter to have 
sexual intercourse with him 
another document quotes a neighbor amanda hinson as saying 
miss parsons told her about the videotape in august 
jan parsons came over to my house and told me that she had had 
sex with rob lowe and to come over and see the videotape of the sex 
scene the affidavit read it also said that she was going to 
use the film to blackmail rob lowe for two million dollars 
another friend lela valerie smith was quoted in documents as 
saying she was told by jan parsons that she had had sex with rob 
lowe and that they all took turns filming each other while 
having sex with mr lowe 
miss parsons who turned 17 in april apparently met lowe at a 
local nightclub during last summers democratic national convention 
lowes public relations firm issued a statement late tuesday 
saying lowe had no comment on the lawsuit and he will have no 
comment until the matter is resolved 
fulton state court judge frank hull ordered that divorce case 
documents related to the case be released saying their contents 
have now been widely reported 
television stations that have broadcast edited portions of the 
tape have said it depicts the girl and another woman having sex 
with lowe directing them off camera the stations say the tape also 
contains scenes of the actor and a male companion having sex with a 
third woman 
slaton said he has not yet requested an appointment with lowe 
but plans to meet with the actor before concluding his criminal 
investigation 
a hearing on motions to dismiss ms wilsons lawsuit against 
lowe is set for june 13 
hue henry the athens attorney representing ms wilson could 
not be reached for comment after business hours wednesday his 
office telephone was answered only with a recording and his home 
telephone is unlisted ms wilson could not be located by telephone 
but the girls father told wsbtv that his daughter never 
intended to blackmail lowe 
no she would never do something like that she wouldnt want 
to be involved in something like that john c parsons said

since abbie hoffmans death last month 
his oldest son has been considering taking over the family 
business agitating 
andrew hoffman 28 has been living a quiet life here as a 
jeweler photographer sculptor and carpenter a selfdescribed 
blue collar jack of all trades 
but it might be time for a change 
so many people are wanting me to take on the family business 
but abbie did a lot of stuff and he had a lot of help he said 
were all feeling a void now before we didnt have to worry 
about it because abbie was out there doing it 
the younger hoffman has been collecting news clippings about his 
fathers death planning memorial services and other benefits 
he had never sought publicity but now hes trying to organize 
fundraisers in memory of his father to help causes that had been 
backed by the 60s radical 
andrew said his first thought after learning of his fathers 
death was that he had committed suicide although now he believes 
there are too many questions surrounding hoffmans death 
the elder hoffman was found dead in a bucks county pa 
apartment in march a medical examiner found he had taken 150 
phenobarbital tablets 
the last year or so he was depressed and he had tried 
suicide before andrew hoffman said but he wasnt depressed in 
the same way he was not suicidal the last conversation i had with 
him was very upbeat 
andrew and his sister ilya are the offspring of hoffmans first 
marriage which ended in 1966 
hoffman left his entire estate to his longtime companion johanna 
lawrenson in a 1983 letter to his children unsealed after his 
death hoffman tried to explain his will 
i felt what he really meant was that we should carry on to do 
what we find best to do in our hearts by not leaving us anything 
monetary he was saying you have my blood and my spirit and you 
can do great things in this world if you just fight on andrew 
hoffman said 
thats basically what im trying to do

the university of california at 
berkeley which for years has tried to come up with an ethnically 
fair admissions formula on wednesday announced a standard based on 
high academic performance regardless of race 
the proposal represents a move back to admissions based on 
academic excellence and away from preferential treatment based on 
ethnic background and considerations said robert l bailey a 
member of the academic senate committee that drafted the proposals 
the changes would restore special considerations for students 
eligible for the university of california and are from poor or 
uneducated families a category eliminated in 1984 said sociology 
professor jerome karabel the committees chairman 
the number of berkeley applicants has increased dramatically 
since 1981 creating ferocious competition and giving the 
campus a chance to attract a student body that is both stronger 
academically and diverse socially and economically than ever 
before karabel said 
the number of applicants for approximately 7700 offers of 
admission at berkeley increased from 9006 in 1981 to 22439 in 
1988 according to university figures only about 3400 students 
actually enroll the rest go on to other universities where they 
also applied 
the changes which will take place by the fall of 1991 if 
approved were made in part because of complaints that current 
policies discriminate against asianamerican applicants 
changes in 198384 withdrew automatic admission for all eligible 
students who were also poor a program that benefited a large 
percentage of asian students karabel said 
thursdays report was issued in the wake of a bitter 
controversy on the berkeley campus over allegations of 
discrimination against asianamericans who comprise about 26 
percent of undergraduates karabel said 
berkeley chancellor ira michael heyman and the asian american 
task force on university of california admissions issued a joint 
statement in march that said policies adopted in 198384 were 
unfair 
under the new proposal which must still be approved by the 
administration the proportion of freshmen admitted on the basis of 
outstanding academic records alone would be increased from 40 
percent to 50 percent 
this will ensure that all students with good enough high school 
records to place them in the top half of berkeleys entering class 
will be accepted the committee said 
in california 328 percent of asian high school graduates meet 
uc eligibility requirements compared to 158 percent of whites and 
5 percent of hispanics and 45 percent of blacks 
another 45 percent of the freshmen would be selected from among 
groups given special consideration all of these students will 
have met academic standards for uc admission placing them in the 
top eighth of the states graduating high school seniors 
the changes would add a category of socioeconomically 
disadvantaged to this group which already includes 
underrepresented minorities on campus blacks hispanics and 
indians as well as outstanding athletes and the disabled 
reentry applicants typically older women would also be given 
special consideration 
there will be more disadvantaged white and asian students on 
the campus karabel said 
the addition of the economic disadvantage category is in 
addition to affirmative action based on race not in place of it 
and will not lower the number of underrepresented minorities on 
campus he said 
the remaining 5 percent accepted would be filled by special 
admission students who do not meet admission standards but are 
accepted because their racial or economic background placed them at 
a disadvantage or because they have special talents such as 
athletic or artistic achievements berkeley currently admits 6 
percent of its freshmen on this basis

a womans age at natural menopause may be an 
indicator of her bodys aging rate and general health according to 
a study that suggests women reaching menopause before age 45 may 
tend to die earlier 
early natural menopause may signal that the body is aging faster 
than normal said coauthor david snowdon of the university of 
minnesota 
he and colleagues from the university and loma linda university 
in california presented the work in junes american journal of 
public health 
other scientists called the work interesting but cautioned that 
its conclusions are limited because of the studys methods 
menopause when a woman permanently stops menstruating 
generally occurs around age 50 
the study was conducted on 5287 white seventh day adventists 
who had experienced natural menopause they filled out 
questionnaires in 1976 when they were ages 55 to 100 of this 
group 663 reached menopause before age 45 
six years later 772 of the women had died from a variety of 
causes including 139 who had menopause before age 45 
women whose menopause had occurred before age 40 showed a 95 
percent higher risk of dying during the six years of the study than 
did women of similar ages whose menopause came at ages 50 to 54 
for women who had reported menopause at ages 40 to 44 the risk 
was 39 percent higher 
in contrast no relationship between age at menopause and death 
appeared in 3166 other seventh day adventists whose menopause was 
caused by surgery 
previous studies have suggested that loss of estrogen production 
at menopause puts women at increased risk of heart disease but the 
new study found that replacing estrogen did not increase longevity 
as well as the finding that surgical menopause did not show the 
link to death that natural menopause did 
that suggests that something other than loss of estrogen caused 
the mortality differences snowdon said 
the study is the sort of thing you cannot dismiss said 
robert n butler chairman of the department of geriatrics and 
adult development at mount sinai medical center in new york i 
certainly take it seriously 
but he said similar research should be conducted in other 
population groups to see if results apply to other women in 
addition he said the study relied on the womens memory of when 
menopause occurred which may have been faulty 
many women do not precisely recall that age said toni miles 
assistant professor of epidemiology at the university of illinois 
at chicago she also questioned whether results from seventh day 
adventists who generally avoid smoking and drinking alcohol would 
apply to others 
if researchers had asked why the women experienced early natural 
menopause it might have revealed diseases that could explain their 
earlier deaths said menopause expert morris notelovitz director 
of the womens medical and diagnostic center in gainesville fla 
he also said the study runs against previous research that 
showed women with early menopause can be protected against heart 
disease by taking estrogen treatments the new results should not 
discourage use of the treatments he said

the massive protests for a freer china have 
prompted an identity crisis at the peoples liberation army is it 
an army serving the people or just those in power 
the pla was the military force that swept the communists to 
power in 1949 establishing along the way a reputation of devotion 
to chinas peasant masses 
in a country where armies often have attracted riffraff 
interested primarily in rape and plunder the army of revolutionary 
leader mao tsetung went to great effort to serve the people and 
treat them decently 
the armys eight points for attention include fair pay for 
purchases the return of all borrowed items no hitting or 
swearing no damage to crops and no liberties with women 
that attitude won over millions of people to the communist 
cause and the image of servant to the masses is still nurtured by 
the army 
the peoples army loves the people has been a refrain from 
soldiers and beijing residents alike since troops were sent to 
restore order in the capital where more than 1 million people have 
demonstrated for a more democratic society press freedom and an 
end to official corruption 
but the pla which has about 32 million soldiers also has 
shown loyalty to individual leaders first mao and now 84yearold 
senior leader deng xiaoping who is thought to be the main force 
behind the hardline stance against student demonstrators 
the argument by deng and his followers that a crackdown on 
prodemocracy students occupying tiananmen square in central 
beijing is necessary to restore order strikes a responsive chord 
among many military leaders 
the problem however is that the people of beijing and other 
major chinese cities have taken to the streets daily to support the 
tiananmen students and demand the ouster of premier li peng the 
most vocal champion of a crackdown 
that outpouring of support for student activists cannot be 
ignored by an army that prides itself as being of the people 
indications are that a split has developed among the military 
over how to proceed 
on monday more than 100 senior military officers signed a 
letter opposing lis declaration of martial law in beijing saying 
the pla will never shoot the people 
former defense minister zhang aiping and former pla chief of 
staff yang dezhi were among those who wrote the letter according 
to a source at the peoples daily 
the same day however the top army command signed a letter 
supporting lis imposition of martial law in beijing on saturday 
it said an extreme minority of people are fanning the flames 
creating turmoil with the goal of negating the leadership of the 
chinese communist party and the socialist system 
caught in the middle are the thousands of soldiers sent to 
beijing to restore order many were deployed on the citys 
outskirts for several days the road to tiananmen blocked by tens 
of thousands of residents before retreating to nearby barracks 
during the standoff the soldiers were befriended by the people 
of beijing the young soldiers were fed entertained lectured 
and most importantly admonished by students and grandparents 
alike not to attack the protesters 
some soldiers clearly were moved

more than 4000 students outfitted with a 
map of an amusement park a few instruments and a questionnaire 
spent a day riding roller coasters and other contraptions to learn 
more about physics 
students from ohio pennsylvania and michigan participated in 
the cedar point amusement parks fourth annual physics day 
tuesdays event allowed students to experience some of the 
concepts they are studying including gravity acceleration and 
centrifugal force 
the rides show how our physics equations relate to real 
life said andre takacs an eighth grader from midview junior 
high school in lorain county if it wasnt for physics there 
wouldnt be roller coasters 
some answers were harder to obtain than others because rain kept 
many rides closed 
it would be a lot easier to measure the speed of the blue 
streak roller coaster if i was on it said angela kabasan of 
midview 
instead of wondering whether they could scream the loudest and 
raise their arms on the downhill students were busy figuring the 
gravitational pull exerted on them by the new magnum xl200 which 
the park bills as the worlds tallest fastest roller coaster 
physics day has been recognized as a valid educational activity 
by the american association of physics teachers said robert 
speers an associate professor at firelands college and originator 
of the physics day program

former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone said in 
longawaited testimony to parliament thursday that he is totally 
innocent of opposition charges that he was linked to the recruit 
influencepeddling scandal 
nakasone spoke under oath in the budget committee of the house 
of representatives and his words were broadcast live nationwide 
though with only a still photo by law live television broadcasts 
are banned from testimony of special witnesses in parliament 
i am totally innocent the former prime minster said in his 
opening statement i refused to testify earlier because i have 
never done anything wrong 
after his statement he faced questioning by opposition parties 
that was to continue for over two hours 
meanwhile support for the governing liberal democratic party 
appeared at an alltime low 
according to a survey of 2280 eligible voters conducted may 
2021 by the masscirculation yomiuri shimbum support for the 
liberal democrats stands at just 265 percent the lowest since its 
founding in 1955 while combined support for five opposition 
parties stands at 267 percent the survey said 441 percent of 
those polled supported no party 
we hope that this testimony before parliament will not be the 
end of the matter and that nakasone will resign from 
parliament and maybe take some others with him said seiji 
masamori of the communist party 
masamori and four other opposition lawmakers questioned nakasone 
in a session scheduled to last 2 hours 20 minutes with the time 
given each determined by his partys number of seats the committee 
chairman of the governing liberal democrats also was to be 
allowed time for questions 
for months the opposition has demanded testimony in parliament 
from nakasone who was prime minister at the time of dubious stock 
deals and large contributions to politicians by the recruit co an 
information and publishing conglomerate 
the liberal democrats refused until last week calling the 
demands improper because of nakasones status as a former prime 
minister 
a long opposition boycott of debate on the budget finally 
changed that 
liberal democrats forced the budget through the house of 
representatives last month but widespread criticism resulted and a 
deal was made the opposition would not boycott the budget in the 
upper house if nakasone testified before the budget committee 
prosecutors have arrested 14 bureaucrats and businessmen so far 
on charges involving bribery and violations of securities laws and 
have filed charges aginst two members of parliament 
recruit sold unlisted shares in a subsidiary to scores of people 
prominent in government and business including at least 17 
politicians or their aides the buyers made large profits when the 
shares went on public sale 
eleven of the 17 were members of nakasones cabinet and 
opposition leaders claim he was a central figure in the scandal 
nakasone prime minister in 198387 has acknowledged his aides 
bought 29000 shares and said the profits were used for political 
activities 
one of the lawmakers against whom bribery charges were filed 
monday was takao fujinami a nakasone lieutenant and former chief 
cabinet secretary 
prime minister noboru takeshita nakasones finance minister and 
successor has said he will resign to take responsibility for the 
recruit scandal 
national newspapers reported last weekend that nakasone would 
resign from parliament but an official of his party faction said 
privately there is no truth to the reports mr nakasone said he 
inends to continue as a legislator although in the face of 
adversity 
tsuruo yamaguchi secretarygeneral of the socialist party the 
largest opposition group has accused nakasone of doing recruit a 
special favor that involved ordering nippon telegraph and telephone 
co and the ministry of posts and telecommunications to buy 
multimilliondollar us supercomputers 
two of the supercomputers made by cray research inc were resold 
to recruit and helped establish it in leasing computer time and 
related telecommunications services 
hisashi shinto former chairman of nippon telegraph and 
telephone which was a government monopoly until 1985 was arrested 
and accused of taking bribes from recruit in the form of the 
bargain stock shares 
the opposition also wants to know whether nakasone recommended 
hiromasa ezoe founder and former chairman of recruit for 
membership on several government advisory committees

yang zhisheng wakes up each morning and stands 
facing the sun atop the commandeered public bus that is his 
temporary home playing his accordion 
nearby a sea of ramshackle tents and campsites stretches across 
tiananmen square 
a makeshift tent city has sprung up on the 100acre square 
where about 30000 students leading a civil uprising for democratic 
reforms and an end to official corruption have camped out for the 
past 13 days 
its great i like sleeping on top of this bus said yang a 
junior from inner mongolia studying management at beijing 
university of science and technology its quite comfortable up 
here 
more than 100 buses are lined up at the north end of the square 
under the gaze of a portrait of mao tsetung communist chinas 
founder students clamber to their lofty beds through windows and 
air vents and hop from roof to roof to get around while others 
bunk out underneath the big rigs 
hundreds of scarlet flags flutter above the squatters and from 
buses which are plastered with slogans such as 11 billion 
hearts are bleeding 
this city within a square has roads food depots clinics and 
its own radio station actually a network of loudspeakers its 
leaders are sequestered at the twotiered monument to the peoples 
heroes surrounded by three cordons of student security guards 
those who built it are their own government and their own police 
only students journalists medical personnel and those 
delivering food are allowed in and the student guards demand 
identification at every checkpoint 
during the day the students take turns guarding tiananmens 
perimeter or defending the square from soldiers who might be sent 
to disperse them 
premier li peng on saturday declared martial law in beijing and 
ordered in soldiers to restore order in response city residents 
blocked major roads with barricades and the soldiers have yet to 
come 
its really tough the government cut off the water at the 
square and wont let some hospitals deliver medicine said a 
sophomore from shenzhen university 1300 miles south of beijing 
duan bin a junior from far western xinjiang province who 
studies at beijing forestry college gestured around a bus provided 
by sympathetic transport workers the people of beijing donated 
everything to us blankets mattresses food clothing 
cigarettes 
two buses set apart from the others are used as toilets 
they reek and leak onto the square 
first aid stations are on the road in front of the museum of 
history on tiananmens east side a week ago the street was 
screaming with ambulances taking away hunger strikers every two to 
three minutes leading students to nickname the alley the 
lifeline 
these days the clinics treat students mainly for colds sore 
throats diarrhea and sunstroke said a volunteer doctor from 
beijing union medical college 
ive only slept two or three hours a day for the last week 
the doctor said i work overnight at the hospital and donate my 
days to the students 
the borders around tiananmen abound with merchants marchers and 
moochers popsicle and soda pop vendors do a booming business and 
do not charge students others hawk watermelons hardboiled eggs 
and chinese crepes while couples picnic in the reviewing stands 
next to the balcony from where mao declared the foundation of the 
peoples republic of china in 1949 
a rainstorm on tuesday scattered hundreds of thousands of 
supporters about 5000 spent the night jammed into two underground 
passageways out of the square turning them into anthills of 
humanity 
the biggest question is how long the squatters will remain the 
studentrun radio has told them to stay until the unpopular li is 
gone but some maintain the students have sown enough confusion in 
the party and military that they can leave in glory 
after a tense weekend when the students and citizenry of beijing 
were convinced they would be attacked by the peoples liberation 
army fears have abated that military might raze the tent city 
despite the martial law decree the only soldiers in sight are 
two honor guards at tiananmens flagpole their holsters empty 
the armys not here so how can this be martial law asked 
yang the accordionist were not afraid the people of beijing 
will keep them out

the senate returns from its memorial day 
recess next week to tackle a pair of bills that fund federal 
efforts against drug dealers and help financially ailing veterans 
programs 
the house on wednesday approved a 37 billion domestic spending 
bill that would pour an additional 822 million into the 
governments antidrug initiatives in 1989 
the chamber approved the measure 227197 on a partyline vote 
after majority democrats beat back repeated republican attempts to 
reject it 
gop lawmakers found themselves boxed into voting against beefing 
up federal drug efforts because the bush administration opposed the 
measure arguing that it would supply more money than the 
authorities need 
house minority leader robert michel rill called the 
legislation and another democratic antidrug proposal that was 
defeated a twoheaded malodorous swamp animal he complained 
that the money in the socalled dire emergency spending bill 
intended for drug efforts and other domestic programs was no 
more a dire emergency than the distinguished chairmans dry 
cleaning 
but democrats who argued that the drug problem affects 
everyone prevailed 
you cant walk the streets in washington or any rural 
community in safety today said house appropriations committee 
chairman jamie whitten dmiss 
the white house has threatened to veto the measure because of 
its antidrug component 
in a statement delivered to lawmakers tuesday the office of 
management and budget noted bushs desire to battle illegal drugs 
but warned this commitment does not mean though that the 
president will forgo the war against the deficit 
the measure now moves to the senate where senators have 
indicated a desire to tack on their favorite programs the senate 
returns from its memorial day recess on wednesday 
on a narrow 213205 tally the house turned down a separate bill 
championed by liberal democrats that would have siphoned money next 
year from star wars research to drug programs the measure would 
have frozen spending for the proposed antimissile defense system 
in fiscal 1990 which begins oct 1 to the same 37 billion level 
of this year money provided by congress above that cap would have 
automatically been transferred to antidrug initiatives 
the 822 million would be spent for building and modernizing 
prisons hiring additional law enforcement officers and other 
drugrelated pursuits 
other funds in the bill include 12 billion for veterans 893 
million for the guaranteed student loan program for college 
students 423 million for state foster care efforts and 88 
million for public housing 
a 47 billion version of the bill failed to garner house 
approval on april 26 when legislators rejected a democratic plan 
to pay for the measure by cutting other programs by 057 percent 
the house also voted 4090 to reaffirm its support for a 
separate bill providing 12 billion for health programs 
costofliving benefit increases and other programs for veterans 
the house initially approved that bill last thursday that same 
evening the senate passed the same bill after limiting its 
spending to about 75 million enough to see the department of 
veterans affairs through june 15 
by creating a need for a later second bill to finance the 
department the senate left a vehicle onto which it could attach 
pet projects of its own 
the senate wont release the veterans as hostages lamented 
silvio conte of massachusetts ranking republican on the house 
appropriations committee

the united states gave somalia weapons which 
were used to crush an insurgency then it turned around and sent 
emergency assistance to patch up the victims 
those are the findings of a report by the congressional general 
accounting office which sent a team to somalia to investigate 
allegations of serious human rights abuses and to find out whether 
us aid was used last year against rebels retaliating for the 
abuses 
the us shipment of 1200 m16 automatic rifles and more than 2 
million rounds of ammunition was authorized in november 1986 as 
part of a military aid package to the strategically located african 
country on the shores of the red sea 
but for technical reasons the delivery did not get to somalia 
until june 28 1988 the report found it was immediately trucked 
to hargeisa a town that government troops were trying to retake 
from the rebels according to the gao the watchdog agency of 
congress 
a senior somali military official confirmed that the us 
equipment was distributed to troops in the north and was used 
during the conflict the report said 
the somali military also resorted to using artillery and 
aerial shelling in heavily populated urban centers and about 70 
percent of hargeisa was damaged or destroyed the team found 
starting in august 1988 the us government responded to the 
emergency with 19 million in disaster assistance to help the 
victims of the conflict said the report the assistance included 
a field hospital unit plastic sheeting blankets and food staples 
it said 
the use of the arms to crush the rebel somali national movement 
prompted the administration to suspend further weapons deliveries 
since then the administration has voluntarily limited the 
military assistance programs to nonlethal items including spare 
parts for previously supplied weapons the report said 
state department officials say the united states has stopped 
deliveries in order to encourage the government to negotiate a 
peace agreement with the snm 
although the government has responded to us pressure and 
released more than 300 political prisoners in recent months no 
progress has been made toward talks with the snm partly through 
the rebels fault 
the curbs on us aid are straining ties with the somali 
government at a time when the united states seeks to renegotiate an 
agreement for use of the berbera port on the red sea under an 
existing agreement which is up for renewal next year berbera is 
used by us ships going to and from the indian ocean 
the fighting between the government and the snm began in may 
1988 when the rebels retaliated against government abuse of rebel 
sympathizers by attacking officials in hargeisa and burao and 
taking over the towns as a result of the fighting 350000 people 
fled to neighboring ethiopia 
a majority of the refugees we interviewed stated that their 
homes were destroyed by shelling despite the absence of snm 
combatants from their neighborhoods the report said the 
refugees also described looting jailing beating and rapes by 
government soldiers prior to the conflict the report said

the robert morris college campus 
including its fabled kissing rock is for sale again after 
school trustees rejected the only bid made at last weeks auction 
but school officials are still hopeful they can negotiate a deal 
with the spurned bidder who offered 400000 
the board simply felt the bid was not right michael viollt 
the schools vice president for financial affairs said wednesday 
instead the board proposed terms which would be acceptable and 
submitted that to the bidder 
the college education foundation a nonprofit association of a 
dozen carthagearea businesses bid for the 20acre campus which 
includes 484 dormitory rooms four classroom buildings a library 
gym and even the kissing rock which fokelore says will bring a 
kiss to whoever sits on it 
i thought we were safe since 400000 was the suggested 
opening bid but sometimes in business deals you have offers and 
counteroffers said terry newell the foundations president 
newell said the schools trustees suggested the campus should go 
for slightly less than 2 million 
i dont think its outrageous newell said but ive got 
to get together with the foundation board and well decide what to 
do 
the college estimates the campus is worth 11 million 
this is a steal at 400000 college president richard 
pickett said after last thursdays auction 
residents were stunned in december when the college said it was 
abandoning this rural western illinois town of 3000 and moving 
the schools headquarters to chicago 260 miles to the northeast 
the school is one of the towns largest employers with 110 
faculty and staff and about 370 students 
robert morris college opened 24 years ago as a business school 
last spring the college opened a new campus in springfield

the bush administration is coming under 
increasing attack for its plan to build new military reactors in 
south carolina and idaho that could provide far more material for 
nuclear warheads than the pentagon says it will need 
the latest barrage of criticism comes from the general 
accounting office the investigative arm of congress it said 
wednesday that lawmakers were given inaccurate and incomplete 
information about key elements of the plan to build reactors in 
south carolina and idaho 
the gao also questioned whether it was necessary to build the 
reactors which the energy department says would provide 150 
percent of the anticipated need for tritium a radioactive gas used 
to boost the explosive power of nuclear warheads 
the administration wants to build one reactor at the federal 
savannah river site near aiken sc and another at the idaho 
national engineering laboratory near idaho falls it says they 
could be built within 10 years for 68 billion 
the main reason for constructing new reactors is that the only 
existing ones capable of producing tritium all situated at the 
savannah river site are shut down for repairs and safety 
improvements until sometime next year they are 35 years old and 
not expected to run more than another 15 years 
ronald w cochran the energy department official in charge of 
the new reactor program told a special panel of the house armed 
services committee on wednesday that the tritium supply outlook was 
a major national security issue 
a crisis is at hand robert b barker the defense 
secretarys top adviser on nuclear energy told the panel in a 
written statement without a source of new tritium unilateral 
disarmament is inevitable 
prominent us scientists however have cast doubt on the claim 
that failure to resume tritium production in the next several years 
would hurt us security 
carson mark a former atomic bomb designer told the panel 
tuesday that congress should put off deciding whether to finance 
the construction of the two new reactors he said the united states 
already has more than enough tritium in hand to maintain its 
existing stockpile of approximately 23000 nuclear weapons 
mark said the improved outlook for substantial new reductions in 
us and soviet nuclear arsenals could eliminate the need for new 
tritiumproduction reactors 
he and other scientists have urged the administration to take 
advantage of the forced suspension of us tritium production to 
propose a mutual ussoviet production ban 
energy secretary james d watkins and other administration 
officials have sought to persuade congress that an improved 
capability to make tritium is vital to us security because there 
is no immediate prospect for complete disarmament 
watkins has acknowledged that two new reactors as envisioned by 
the administrations plan would provide more tritium production 
capacity than is needed but he said this would provide insurance 
against possible mechanical failures or other problems such as the 
safety questions raised about the existing older reactors 
j dexter peach an assistant gao comptroller general said the 
administration needs to take a closer look at the budget 
implications of the tworeactor approach he noted that the energy 
department already faces a daunting task in finding an estimated 
100 billion or more to clean up the environmental damage caused by 
40 years of nuclear weapons production at existing sites 
peach said the energy department in its august 1988 report to 
congress on the new reactor plan had inaccurately estimated the 
costs involved and the amount of time it would take to get the 
reactors running peach did not give his own cost estimate but said 
the 10year construction schedule was at least 2 years too short

to get to tiananmen square ji xiujie took three 
trains blocked railroad tracks for hours with his classmates 
bounced along in a bus and threatened a police officer with a 
beating 
but the student from chongqing an industrial city about 1100 
miles from beijing finally made it to the heart of chinas 
monthlong student movement for freedom 
i will tell my children about this with pride said the 
20yearold junior from chongqing university surrounded by his 
classmates under a makeshift styrofoam tent i have come to 
beijing to take part in a great revolution 
ji is one of tens of thousands of students from outside beijing 
who made the long march to the capital to demonstrate for a more 
democratic china and the resignation of premier li peng and senior 
leader deng xiaoping 
the students presence in beijing has given the movement a boost 
now that thousands of others in the capital have retuned to their 
schools exhausted after sleeping for 10 days on concrete 
indeed the outoftowners now make up more than half of the 
students on the square student leaders say 
many traveled across the country for free because train clerks 
and ticket sellers also support the movement now they live on the 
good graces of beijing residents who bring them noodles and steamed 
bread and man the blockades keeping army troops out of the city 
their travels have echoes in chinas recent past during the 
ultraleftist cultural revolution hundreds of thousands of 
students took to the road to visit the revolutionary sites for 
many the experiences on the road as red guards were formative ones 
for ji his travels to beijing play the same role 
ji and about 30 classmates started their trek to beijing on 
friday night a day before premier li peng ordered a martial law 
crackdown in beijing to suppress the movement 
by the time we left there was a news blackout on the movement 
throughout all of china ji said we just had to know what was 
going on 
on sunday they arrived in loyang in henan province but police 
on orders to keep protesters from coming to beijing forced them 
onto a train returning to chongqing 
they got off a few stops later and rented a minibus to head 
back to loyang to get a train to beijing 
a police officer came to the bus station and said we couldnt 
go ji said we pleaded with him but he refused to give in 
finally the sichuan students threatened him with a thrashing 
and he let them go that was very satisfying shi zhifen a 
sichuan classmate said with a smile 
in loyang they boarded another train but it was stopped in 
anyang another henan city 
police threw all the students off said ji 
thousands of students then began a demonstration in the station

as quickly as rumors began sweeping the 
capitol that jim wright might soon step down as house speaker they 
were followed by speculation on the fights likely to ensue over 
democratic leadership posts 
at least nine names led by majority leader tom foley of 
washington were mentioned wednesday as various scenarios emerged 
for how the wright succession could play out 
foley was regarded as the overwhelming favorite to become 
speaker should wright step down but potentially tough fights could 
emerge for the posts of majority leader and majority whip 
there is near unanimity of support for tom foley said rep 
pat williams dmont 
i dont think the angel gabriel could beat tom foley said 
another congressman who insisted on anonymity 
but that didnt halt speculation that a clean sweep slate 
would emerge to challenge all the incumbent members of the 
democratic leadership 
under that scenario rep richard gephardt of missouri would run 
for speaker joining him on a slate would be rep ed jenkins of 
georgia as a candidate for majority leader and rep bill gray of 
pennsylvania currently chairman of the house democratic caucus and 
the only black mentioned as a candidate for a top leadership post 
for majority whip 
other names mentioned were rep beryl anthony of arkansas 
chairman of the house democratic campaign committee rep dan 
rostenkowski of illinois ways and means committee chairman rep 
john dingell of michigan chairman of the energy and commerce 
committee and rep mike synar of oklahoma 
one rumor was that wright would announce his resignation 
effective next wednesday and even that timing was considered 
significant in any leadership fight 
the next meeting of the democratic caucus is scheduled for 
wednesday and if that is the day wright steps down the assembled 
democrats would vote that day for their choices for the leadership 
posts 
the theory was that a quick vote would favor incumbent 
leadership figures such as foley and rep tony coelho of 
california the democratic whip challengers would have little 
chance to round up support because most house members would be 
scattered across the country for the long memorial day weekend 
but coelho the thirdranking member of the house leadership 
has ethics problems of his own the congressman has acknowledged 
that he failed to disclose a 50000 loan from a savings and loan 
in california that he used toward purchase of 100000 worth of 
junk bonds 
despite that coelho was regarded as likely to bid for the 
majority leaders post he might face a challenge even if he opted 
to remain as whip 
gephardt was considered more likely to challenge coelho for 
majority leader than to oppose foley for the speakership 
dingell said he expected foley to run for speaker and i expect 
to support him if for any reason foley decided against trying 
to succeed wright dingell said he would consider my own 
options 
rostenkowski was described by house sources who declined to 
speak for attribution as content to remain as head of the ways and 
means committee but also interested in blocking foleys accession 
to the speakership 
jenkins was a favorite of many southerners who were concerned 
that wrights resignation would leave their region without anyone 
in the leadership 
jenkins also is closely tied to rostenkowski 
there is talk about succession and how you do it said 
williams if the speaker resigns the house is then faced with a 
vacancy in the person third in line to be president we must move 
quickly

a federal judge refused to continue an 
injunction that banned herbicide use on national forests in oregon 
and washington allowing the use of 13 chemicals on pacific 
northwest timberland 
district judge james m burns order wednesday affects us 
forest service land us bureau of land management timberland in 
the region remains under the injunction 
a legal dispute began in 1983 when the northwest coalition for 
alternatives to pesticides and other groups filed a lawsuit 
claiming herbicide spraying practices violated federal 
environmental laws 
the order includes a mediated agreement that spells out how the 
forest service will implement its 1988 environmental impact 
statement on controlling unwanted vegetation on land it manages 
herbicides are sprayed on timberlands in the pacific northwest 
to control competing vegetation that might otherwise overwhelm 
newly planted douglas fir seedlings 
mary obrien of the northwest coalition said conservation groups 
were satisfied with the mediated settlement because it makes it 
clear alternatives will be tried before herbicides are applied 
obrien said the agreement calls for the forest service to 
stress prevention of vegetation management problems in developing 
plans for harvesting timber each project will be analyzed and the 
public will have a chance to comment before any treatment method 
including herbicides is used 
she said the forest service also had agreed to look into what 
happens when vegetation treated with certain herbicides is burned 
michael ferris a forest service spokesman said the process of 
analzying and taking comment on potential spraying projects meant 
that it would be months before herbicides are actually applied to 
forest lands 
i dont think well see anything before next year he said

a cholesterolcarrying particle in the blood may 
encourage heart attacks by hampering the bodys ability to destroy 
blood clots researchers reported today 
two teams of scientists found that in the test tube the 
particle known as lipoprotein a interfered with a key step in 
clot destruction 
clots trigger heart attacks by plugging narrowed arteries and 
one researcher said they may encourage the narrowing of the 
arteries in the first place 
the studies appear in todays issue of the british journal 
nature 
lipoprotein a resembles the betterknown lowdensity 
lipoprotein the socalled bad cholesterol that contributes to 
atherosclerosis the buildup of material on artery walls the 
buildup narrows the vessels and sets the stage for heart attacks 
lipoprotein a also is associated with atherosclerosis and 
heart attacks scientists from the research institute of scripps 
clinic in la jolla calif and the university of chicago noted in 
their nature report 
they followed up on the earlier discovery that one component of 
the lipoprotein a particle strongly resembles a blood protein 
called plasminogen 
plasminogen plays a key role in the destruction of blood clots 
once it binds to other proteins called receptors the receptors 
appear on blood cells and the lining of blood vessels 
researchers found that in the test tube lipoprotein a also 
bound to those receptors interfering with the plasminogen binding 
so in the body that interference may hamper the destruction of 
clots they suggested 
the same result was reported in the second nature paper by 
scientists from cornell university medical college and rockefeller 
university in new york they also found evidence of lipoprotein a 
accumulations in the atherosclerotic buildup in blood vessels 
katherine hajjar study coauthor from cornell said some 
scientists suspect that repeated clot formation may predispose a 
blood vessel to atherosclerosis so high levels of lipoprotein a 
may encourage atherosclerosis by hampering a vessels ability to 
fight clot formation she said 
the testtube results make it logical to suspect that 
lipoprotein a may hamper clot destruction in humans said john 
albers of the university of washington school of medicine 
for more evidence scientists should follow people with 
different levels of lipoprotein a to see if they show different 
rates of clotinduced heart attacks and strokes he said

scientists have located a gene responsible for 
irregularly shaped moles that are a major underlying cause of fatal 
skin cancer 
the gene causes moles known as dysplastic nevi which often run 
in families the moles can become cancerous resulting in malignant 
melanoma 
unlike other forms of skin cancer melanoma is often fatal most 
cases are not inherited but about 10 percent of cases occur in 
people with a family history of the disease 
in the research scientists came closer to locating the gene 
involved in inherited melanoma although they have not yet isolated 
it 
they said their work provides a starting point for the use of 
molecular techniques to identify the gene for the disorder and 
characterize its function 
the research was directed by dr sherri j bale of the national 
cancer institute and was published in todays new england journal 
of medicine 
they said that finding the gene and learning the protein it 
makes should help scientists understand the causes of inherited 
melanoma 
the research was based on genetic studies of 99 relatives and 26 
spouses in six families where melanoma is common thirtyfour 
family members had malignant melanoma and 31 of these also had 
dysplastic nevi twentyfour other relatives had dysplastic nevi

gen manuel antonio noriega met with 
an organization of american states delegation and told them it 
would be a dangerous precedent for them to interfere in a countrys 
internal affairs 
noriega also blamed the united states and its history of 
intervention in panama for the countrys political crisis 
today its panama tomorrow it could be any other country 
the defense forces chief told journalists wednesday after meeting 
the oas delegates 
the oas mission was sent in response to the noriegacontrolled 
governments voiding of the may 7 presidential vote and the beating 
of the top three opposition candidates by pronoriega thugs 
international observers say the opposition won the balloting by a 
31 margin 
opposition leaders also met with the oas delegation on wednesday 
and said they want their election victory recognized and noriega 
retired 
about 300 marchers accompanied opposition presidential candidate 
guillermo endara and his running mates ricardo arias calderon and 
guillermo ford to the oas delegations hotel 
the demonstration in defiance of a government ban was broken 
up peacefully by about 25 riot police wielding bullhorns arias 
calderon said two opposition workers were arrested 
maj edgardo lopez a noriega spokesman said that when the 
issue of retiring noriega was raised staff officers expressed 
loyalty to noriega and told the oas delegates the matter was solely 
up to the defense forces 
when asked directly what he planned to do noriega thought a 
second and said thats the milliondollar question 
oas spokesman edgardo costa called the 2hour discussion with 
noriega and his staff very informative the visiting delegation 
comprises the foreign ministers of trinidad and tobago guatemala 
and ecuador and oas secretarygeneral joao baena soares of brazil 
we talked about the intimidation of outrages of excessive 
foreign presence and intimidation by air sea land submarine 
even the ozone layer has suffered intervention noriega joked 
washington has been working for noriegas ouster since the 
general was indicted on drugtrafficking charges in florida last 
year 
after the opposition candidates were beaten president bush sent 
1900 extra troops to augment security at us panama canal 
installations 
the troops have conducted exercises and run armed convoys along 
panamanian roads as permitted by the 1977 treaties under which the 
united states must turn the canal over to panama in 1999 
noriega who denies the drug charges claims the united states 
is trying to oust him because it does not want to give up the canal 
it built and protected for so long 
noriega has a historical perspective on the issues said 
costa the oas spokesman he said noriegas talk went back to how 
the united states wanting a canal helped found panama in 1903 
by aiding its secession from colombia 
the oas passed a resolution last week criticizing noriega and 
calling for a transfer of power in the shortest possible time 
the panamanian government said some aspects of the resolution 
including the mention of noriega violate the oas charter it said 
it would accept no interference in panamas internal affairs 
noriega holds power in panama through his command of the defense 
forces which have so far remained loyal despite us and 
opposition calls for a coup 
acting president manuel solis palma told an open meeting of 
government bureaucrats on wednesday that no new elections are 
possible before sept 1 when his term as minister in charge of 
the presidency ends 
solis palma replaced eric arturo delvalle in the presidency 
after delvalle tried to fire noriega in february 1988 following 
noriegas indictment on us drugtrafficking and money laundering 
charges 
noriega denies the charges 
the meeting with the oas was pointedly held in a building in the 
panamanian section of fort amador a former us installation at 
the edge of panama city 
the fence that surrounds the building abuts a us naval 
station and even noriega must pass a us military policeman to 
enter the area

the us pharmaceutical industry holds a 
substantial lead over japan in use of biotechnology to develop new 
drugs for fighting cancer aids and other diseases according to 
the food and drug administration 
japanese production of new drugs with biotechnology techniques 
is robust but the us holds roughly a 21 lead in both numbers of 
companies involved and numbers of products said henry i miller 
special assistant to fda commissioner frank e young 
miller said wednesday that the us edge was documented in a 
recent study by the agency he also noted that an october 1988 
survey by the pharmaceutical manufacturers association found that 
54 us companies had 97 products in some phase of clinical 
testing while the fda study found that the japanese had 24 
companies with a total of 45 products 
miller spoke at a ews conference sponsored by the 
washingtonbased pharmaceutical association the groups president 
gerald j mossinghoff said he was encouraged by findings of the 
fda study 
five years ago there were predictions that japan would 
overtake us in biotechnology by the end of the decade 
mossinghoff said that has not happened there is enormous 
vitality in todays biotechnology research and development in the 
united states 
mossinghoff said 70 genetically engineered drugs and vaccines 
are in human clinical tests in this country while 10 others on 
which clinical testing has been completed are at the fda for review 
before they can be marketed 
the total of 80 is fewer than the 97 products cited in the 
october 1988 survey because the association since then has decided 
to focus only on drugs and vaccines that result from genetic 
engineering excluding other biotechnology products such as 
synthetic peptides 
genetic engineering involves manipulating the genes that 
determine the fundamental physical characteristics of an organism 
mossinghoff said that of 182 biotechnology health care patents 
issued in the united states last year 155 had american owners 
far ahead of japan with 15 patents and western europe with nine 
the latest survey released by the industry association found 
that cancer is still the main focus of pharmaceutical biotechnology 
research more than half 45 of the products involved in 
clinical tests or undergoing fda review are targeted at cancer or 
related conditions 
it also reported that 14 genetically engineered products 
almost twice as many as were listed in the associations first such 
survey last july are being tested for aids or aidsrelated 
illnesses 
mossinghoff said the association is concerned about efforts by 
states to get involved in duplicative and unnecessary 
regulation of biotechnology despite the existence of a 
comprehensive regulatory scheme at the federal level 
he said that in 1988 10 state legislative measures were 
introduced and three passed in hawaii maine and wisconsin 
currently mossinghoff said another biotechnologyrelated bill 
is awaiting the governors action in wisconsin while additional 
measures are pending before legislators in that state new jersey 
new york oregon texas and washington

the justice department reportedly is 
conducting preliminary criminal investigations of mayor tom bradley 
and rep tony coelho involving financial dealings with drexel 
burnham lambert inc 
details of the investigations remained secret but a key 
question under scrutiny was whether bradley and the house majority 
whip received illegally preferential treatment with the firms 
junk bond dealers the los angeles times report today 
the probe was likely to study whether investment opportunities 
may have been offered to the two democrats in exchange for possible 
political favors the newspaper reported citing unidentified 
sources 
the report of the preliminary investigation of bradley follows a 
federal subpoena issued last week by the us attorneys office in 
new yorks manhattan district seeking records of his transactions 
with the beleaguered brokerage firm 
such a preliminary investigation is the first official step in 
the justice departments formal process for determining whether 
evidence warrants a fullscale grand jury investigation leading to 
possible criminal prosecution 
the justice department declined to comment on the matter the 
newspaper said 
bradley spokesman bill chandler said that the mayor was unaware 
of any such investigation 
coehlo spokesman fred hatfield said the california congressman 
is positive he is not the target of a justice department 
investigation 
bradley and coehlo have acknowledged they made investment deals 
through drexel burnham 
the brokerage house came under scrutiny after allegations of 
insider trading and other securities violations were leveled 
against los angelesbased michael milken who built its junk bond 
division and established the highrisk highyield bonds into a 
premiere tool to finance corporate takeovers 
the investigations were begun in washington by the justice 
departments public integrity section after an apparent 
disagreement between us attorneys offices in los angeles and new 
york over whether they were warranted the times said 
in los angeles us attorney robert bonner reportedly concluded 
that the available facts did not call for further inquiries 
but sources told the newspaper acting us attorney benito 
romano of new york concluded that information gathered in his 
offices longrunning investigation of drexel burnham warranted 
inquiries into dealings between the investment firm and bradley and 
coelho 
since romanos office lacked jurisdiction to pursue the probes 
because the transactions in question took place in los angeles the 
public integrity section assumed responsibility for the 
investigations after concluding they were warranted the times said 
the section is a justice department unit responsible for looking 
into allegations of corruption against judges and other political 
figures 
bradley who last month won an unprecedented fifth term as 
mayor faces several investigations into allegations of financial 
misdeeds and possible political favoritism 
coelho the thirdranking member of the house leadership has 
acknowledged that he failed to disclose a 50000 loan from a 
savings and loan in california that he used toward purchase of 
100000 worth of junk bonds

taxes take almost 36 percent of the income of 
the average american but about half the earnings of the nations 
richest and poorest families the tax foundation says 
for most taxpayers the federal system is progressive meaning 
it is based in large part on ability to pay the foundation said 
but state and local taxes are moderately regressive falling 
disproportionately on those with lower incomes 
in a study released wednesday the nonpartisan research 
organization found great disparity in the way some taxes are 
distributed among the various income levels 
for example the individual income tax burden of the 
90000ormore income group who pay 274 percent of income is 
nine times greater than that of a family in the lowest income 
class which pays at an effective rate of 31 percent the 
foundation said the average of all income groups is about 114 
percent 
conversely the gasoline tax burden is almost 10 times greater 
for the lowest income group 188 percent of income than for the 
highest income families which pay 019 percent the report 
stated the national average is 071 percent 
in 1986 households under 10000 gave just about half their 
incomes 495 percent to federal state and local governments 
those with incomes of 90000 and more paid an average 516 
percent the foundation said 
the tax burden of americans at all income levels averaged 3553 
percent in 1986 and rose slightly to 3631 percent a year later 
the figures do not take into account the massive tax overhaul 
enacted in 1986 but foundation economists estimated those changes 
had little effect on distribution of the individual income tax 
burden except to lessen the load at lowest income levels 
the foundation whose trustees include heads of some of the 
nations largest corporations conducted the study with an eye on 
the battle to cut the federal deficit even while that fight is 
being waged wrote robert c brown president of the foundation 
there is a continuing cry for expanding some spending programs and 
creating others 
fundamental to balancing these competing voices is an 
awareness of where public money comes from how the burden falls 
upon various income classes and what types of taxes account for 
the various income streams flowing to public coffers brown 
wrote the study he said seeks to provide some of the answers 
the study reinforced conclusions that liberals have argued for 
several years that the individual income tax is the most 
progressive part of the tax system while excise taxes on gasoline 
cigarettes and alcohol are the most regressive 
in 1986 the average under10000 family used 022 percent of 
its income to pay the federal tax on telephone service that tax 
claimed only 05 percent of the family making between 30000 and 
40000 payments for social insurance chiefly social security 
took 106 percent of the income from a family making 15000 to 
20000 but 617 percent of those with incomes over 90000 
a family with income between 10000 and 15000 paid 336 of 
its income for state and local sales taxes compared with 142 
percent for a 90000 family 
the wealthiest families paid an effective rate of almost 38 
percent in federal taxes compared with 199 percent for the 
3000040000 family state and local taxes took almost 137 
percent from the richest and just under 16 percent from the 
1500019000 family 
the foundation acknowledged that the study understates total tax 
burdens because it is based on a very broad definition of income 
for example the rental value of the home a family owns is counted 
as income as are employerpaid health insurance and pension 
contributions as well as welfare payments 
the study also assumed that all taxes including those collected 
from corporations are paid by individuals

something to contemplate next time you are 
stuck in a supermarket checkout line in a survey seven out of 10 
shoppers say the line in their supermarket moves fast enough 
nine out of 10 rate that aspect of their shopping trip as an 
important factor when deciding where to get their groceries 
the food marketing institute a trade organization representing 
the owners of 17000 us retail food stores which do a total of 
180 billion of business a year has just issued results of its 
18th annual survey of supermarket shoppers 
while most people rated a speedy checkout as important they 
gave even more weight to seven other factors the quality of the 
fruits and vegetables important to 98 percent the variety of 
goods the quality of meat the friendliness of workers the 
prices the readability and accuracy of shelf tags and the stores 
location 
the survey conducted by opinion research corp through 
telephone interviews with 1031 shoppers also made these points 
the shoppers said they spend an average of 74 a week on 
groceries up 3 over last year and up 19 since 1981 they go to 
the supermarket an average of 23 times a week same as last year 
only about a third of them use coupons or look at ads in the 
newspaper for specials thats down significantly from previous 
years 
one person in five said he buys postage stamps frequently in his 
supermarket among people whose stores dont sell stamps one in 
four said he would buy them there if they were offered 
sixtynine percent of the women and 63 percent of the men said 
their diets could be either a lot or somewhat healthier thirty 
percent of the men and 22 percent of the women said their diets are 
healthy enough 
threequarters of the shoppers under age 24 said they ought to 
be eating healthier but of shoppers over age 65 only half felt 
that way 
as for what they do eat one in six people claimed to eat more 
fruit and vegetables than they used to one in three to eat less 
meat one in five to eat less fat oil and sugar 
eighteen percent said they eat more fish 16 percent said they 
eat more chicken 13 percent said they use less salt 10 percent 
said they eat less fried food 
about six people in 10 said cholesterol and fats are serious 
hazards four years ago it was slightly more than four in 10 but 
only a fifth of those asked thought sugar is a serious hazard down 
from five years ago when one person in three thought so 
somewhat more than half of those questioned said they are 
preparing food differently than they did three to five years ago 
last year twothirds said yes to that question 
of those who claim to have changed their cooking methods 37 
percent fry less 24 percent use less salt 22 percent use the 
microwave more and 20 percent add less fat 
but last year even more people claimed to be cutting down on 
salt fat and sugar 
people in the east said yes more often than those in other parts 
of the country when asked if they worry about spoilage or germs 
tampering or improper packaging or canning of food or pesticides 
or residues in their food 
but midwesterners are more likely than other people to worry 
about unsanitary handling of food by supermarket employees or 
fellow shoppers and midwesterners southerners and westerners 
worry twice as much as easterners about food preservatives 
the survey had a sampling error depending on the percentage of 
those responding to individual questions that ranged from 19 to 
31 percent

after such a sharp rise of the dollar everybodys selling it 
now to collect profits he said 
the trader said the dollars downswing followed its trend in new 
york wednesday where market players sold the currency after 
president bushs comment that the dollars recent sharp rise was 
not favorable it closed at 14290 yen on wall street 
on the stock exchange dealers said the nikkei rose as the yen 
started to recover against the dollar 
uncertainties over the foreign exchange market and over a 
possible discount rate hike remain in the stock market making 
trading less active the dealer said 
market sources and media reports have been speculating the bank

bicycle helmets are so effective at preventing 
head injuries that a major campaign should be launched to encourage 
riders to wear them a study published today concludes 
although many people have long assumed that helmets are an 
important part of bike safety there has been little scientific 
data to back this up now a study has shown that riders with 
helmets had an 85 percent reduction in their risk of head injury 
and an 88 percent reduction in their risk of brain damage 
yet despite their value the report found children who are 
involved in bicycling accidents rarely wear them 
safety helmets are effective but they are not being used 
enough the researchers wrote the time has come for a major 
campaign to increase their use 
they said that stated another way their results suggest that 
people who ride without helmets are seven times more likely to 
suffer head injuries and eight times more likely to get brain 
injuries than riders who do 
the report based on injuries treated at five seattle area 
hospitals over a oneyear period was directed by dr robert s 
thompson of the group health cooperative in seattle it was 
published in the new england journal of medicine 
they noted that in 1985 bicycle injuries accounted for an 
estimated 574000 emergency room visits and 1300 deaths in the 
united states the most common cause of death and serious 
disability in biking accidents is head injury 
among the findings 
sixtyeight percent of the severe brain injuries occurred in 
children under age 15 
only 4 percent of those with brain injuries were wearing 
helmets 
of the children under age 15 who were involved in biking 
accidents 4 percent wore helmets 
use of helmets increased substantially in those over age 25 
physicians are not always aware of the importance of helmets 
and they are seldom part of health education efforts the 
researchers wrote these factors certainly contribute to their 
lack of widespread use 
the study was based on 235 people who suffered head injuries 
while bicycling they were compared with 433 people who received

members of a house ethics task force have been 
told that members of congress can ban honoraria raise their pay 
and still survive politically to serve another term 
why dont you just do it youre not going to lose your 
seats lloyd n cutler the chairman of a nowdefunct 
presidential pay commission testified wednesday before the 
eightmember panel studying changes in house ethics rules 
cutler white house counsel in the carter administration even 
suggested how lawmakers could accomplish the politically risky 
task vote this year for a package to abolish honoraria and 
increase pay by an equal amount make the change effective in 
january 1991 and take the case to the voters next year 
its a risk but its a principled stand if the public 
decides that it prefers the finest congress that other peoples 
money can buy i should think you would not wish to be a member of 
that kind of a congress cutler said 
cutler testified only days after house and senate members 
disclosed they earned more than 87 million in honoraria last 
year mostly from speeches to special interest groups 
the chairman of the former commission on executive legislative 
and judicial salaries cutler referred to special interest payments 
of speaking fees as dishonoraria and a totally indefensible 
practice 
the system comes very close to government for sale at least 
legislation for sale cutler said 
cutlers commission recommended and former president reagan 
proposed that congress this year raise its pay 51 percent while 
abolishing honoraria 
after a public outcry that included a campaign against the raise 
by radio talk show hosts across the nation the house voted 38048 
and the senate 946 last february to defeat the pay plan cutler 
recalled receiving a letter during the debate that said the only 
thing worse than a public official is a child molester 
before the plan collapsed a bipartisan group of house leaders 
had worked out broad outlines for a proposal that would have 
abolished honoraria in return for more pay and instituted other 
ethics reforms 
after the whole package was dropped speaker jim wright 
appointed the eightmember task force to conduct a longterm ethics 
review and divided the panels membership equally between the two 
parties with reps vic fazio dcalif and lynn martin rill 
as cochairs 
cutler also suggested that congress end the current restrictions 
on amounts of outside earned income that members can receive and 
move instead to establish categories of outside earnings that would 
be permitted or prohibited 
examples of harmless outside earnings that should be 
allowed he said could include income from writing books 
currently rankandfile house members can retain 30 percent of 
their 89500 salaries or 26850 in earned outside income 
senators can keep 40 percent or 35800 there is no restriction 
on unearned income such as investment earnings 
edward sg dennis chief of the justice departments criminal 
division and former sen charles mcc mathias jr rmd told the 
task force that the same ethics rules should be applied to all 
three branches of government unless there are valid reasons for 
exceptions ethics provisions currently are far more stringent in 
some areas for top executive branch officials than for members of 
congress 
president bush has proposed legislation that would revise ethics 
laws and would extend many provisions to lawmakers for the first 
time

engineers analyzed radio data and 
inspected a failed engine valve today to learn why the launch of a 
hightech navigation satellite was aborted at the last second 
wednesday nights postponement was the fourth in five days for 
the launch of the delta 2 
after the engine ignition command was given a computer sensed a 
stuck fuel valve and stopped the delta 2 rockets main engine from 
firing 
we have a main engine cutoff reported lt col ron rand 
the air force launch commentator 
the 12storytall rocket remained locked firmly on the launch 
pad rand said the launch team used remote controls to stabilize 
pressures and make the vehicle safe 
at no time were we in a hazardous condition said the launch 
test director air force lt col bob tayloe 
the delta 2 was to have boosted into orbit a 65 million navstar 
satellite that will enable us and allied military units such as 
ships planes submarines and tanks to determine their location 
within 50 feet anywhere on the globe 
tayloe said no new launch date would be set until experts learn 
what went wrong and the problem is fixed he said the delay would 
be at least a few days 
he said a valve in the main liquid oxygen propellant line failed 
to open the engine ignition command had been given he said but 
with no oxygen the engine sequence shut down 
the valve failure meant the engine did not get enough fuel the 
oxygen mixes with a kerosenelike propellant to power the 
spacecraft 
small steering rockets at the base of the delta 2 flashed to 
life when the ignition command was given 
but the main engine start is delayed 23 seconds to allow 
propellant to flow into the ignition chamber and to give the 
computer a chance to determine if anything is wrong 
if the propellant flows properly the main engine ignites and 
pressures build up a signal for nine solid fuel booster rockets 
surrounding the engine to fire and start the rocket on its way 
without the proper pressure reading the signal did not go to 
the solids tayloe said 
the cutoff at 748 pm occurred in the final seconds of a 
nineminute launch opportunity dictated by the requirement to 
launch the satellite into the proper orbit the first part of the 
launch window was eaten up while a weather plane inspected 
clouds suspected of containing potentially dangerous lightning 
when none was detected the allclear was given

massachusetts officials say energy secretary 
james d watkins paints an incorrectly bleak picture when he 
says new england cant generate sufficient energy without the 
seabrook nh atomic plant 
watkins assertion that new england desperately needs seabrook 
to avoid utilityimposed brownouts and blackouts is simply 
incorrect massachusetts energy resources secretary sharon m 
pollard said wednesday 
watkins on monday submitted an affidavit urging the us circuit 
court of appeals to reject a plea by massachusetts and antinuclear 
groups to block a lowpower testing license for seabrook he said 
the 1150megawatt reactor was the only nearterm answer to meet 
the regions growing energy demand 
this assertion is false and paints an incorrectly bleak 
picture of the current electric supply situation countered 
pollard in an affidavit and letter submitted to the court wednesday 
in response to the federal energy chief she said new englands 
power needs can be met with improvements in energy conservation 
management and efficiency 
pollard also said watkins was wrong in his assertion that new 
england last year suffered rolling blackouts or 
utilityimposed power outages due to severe shortages 
new england did not experience any rolling blackouts during 
the summer of 1988 pollard wrote according to the director of 
power planning for the new england power pool there were only 
isolated localized blackouts due to malfunctions in the 
distribution system not due to new englandwide capacity 
deficiencies 
massachusetts attorney general james m shannon criticized 
watkins for inserting himself in the dispute over lowpower 
licensing between seabrook opponents and the nuclear regulatory 
commission which is an independent federal regulatory agency 
i dont think its appropriate for the energy secretary to be 
wading into these adjudicatory proceedings at this point shannon 
said in a telephone interview from boston i think it undermines 
the credibility of the whole process 
shannon noted that watkins affidavit did not address any of the 
safety and financial concerns raised by seabrook opponents in their 
request for an emergency stay of the license 
theyre trying to inject extraneous policy ideological 
arguments into a legal proceeding its not appropriate the 
attorney general said theres nothing in the law that says 
safety standards shall be met unless the energy secretary says 
theres a need for the energy theres nothing that justifies a 
terribly unsafe nuclear power plant 
if hes going to involve himself in the question of nuclear 
power plants then he should familiarize himself with what the law 
requires they think they can rewrite the law through these kinds 
of affidavits and regulations shannon said 
shannon and gov michael s dukakis say the plant should never 
be licensed because of the difficulties of evacuating residents in 
the coastal towns near the plant 
meanwhile the nrc voted 40 wednesday to reject opponents 
request to reconsider last weeks commission order denying a 
regulatory stay the request was filed monday on the basis of 
critics assertions that a plant computer system designed to assess 
the radiological consequences of an accident was insufficient 
the lateness of intervenors raising this new theory 
constitutes a total failure timely to alert the commission to their 
concerns acting nrc secretary john c hoyle wrote in a 
threepage order moreover it is clear demonstration that this 
matter is not one that even in intervenors eyes jeopardizes public 
health and safety during the limited lowpower operations 
authorized for seabrook 
the opponents which include the state the town of hampton 
nh the seacoast antipollution league and the new england 
coalition against nuclear pollution filed a new stay motion with 
the appeals court wednesday based on that contention 
massachusetts deputy attorney general stephen jonas said the 
argument was strengthened wednesday when the nrcs atomic safety 
and licensing appeal board sent the issue back to the licensing 
board which had thrown it out monday

as many as 1500 ravens are 
targeted for execution to protect mojave desert tortoises which 
are too slow to escape the birds hunting prowess 
hundreds of tortoise shells stacked next to some raven nests 
help the us bureau of land management to identify 200 to 300 
ravens that habitually feast on young tortoises 
in a pilot program to protect the tortoises the agency began 
killing the birds last week at one site and two more sites are 
being prepared for the fourmonth kill 
the agency said up to 1500 ravens could be killed if it saves 
enough tortoises in recent years ravens have been killing a 
disproportionate number of tortoises 
in spots ravens are responsible for 85 percent of young 
tortoise deaths said agency wildlife biologist ted rado 
once rare in the desert 125 miles northeast of los angeles the 
ravens now number between 10000 and 12000 15 times their 1968 
population 
officials have prepared for the raven kill by getting the birds 
accustomed to a diet of hardboiled eggs at the appointed hour 
the eggs are laced with starlicide a poison originally used to 
kill european starlings 
weve gone to great pains to absolutely minimize the 
poisoning of nontarget animals rado said 
the eggs are wired to a platform and removed at night officials 
said starlicide breaks down into nontoxic compounds so the dead 
ravens will pose no threat to wildlife higher in the food chain 
other ravens will be shot with rifles which rado suspects will 
prove a less successful method he said the birds will likely learn 
quickly to steer clear of humans

protesters in shanghai and the northwestern 
cities of xian and lanzhou staged funerals last week for students 
who died in beijing during a hunger strike for freedom and 
democracy 
the somber shanghai procession featured huge wreaths of flowers 
to remember comrades in beijing that an epitath said were 
sacrificed for democracy 
the only problem nobody died 
without a free press at a time of great social and political 
turmoil china has been taken over by rumors 
from student loudspeakers official government sources 
journalists and the man on the street the flow of hints and 
innuendoes is unceasing 
sometimes the rumors are created to sully an enemy or aid a 
friend sometimes it seems all of beijing is playing a gigantic 
game of telephone with no goal other than the passing of 
strange information 
chinese with a political ax to grind are putting out false or 
distorted information to benefit whichever faction they support 
others reveling in their life on the inside track are relaying 
the stories with all the glee of smalltown gossips 
the situation is so bad the government outlawed rumormongering 
in beijing when it declared martial law on saturday 
widespread student rumors included an imminent attack on 
tiananmen square which student protesters have occupied by 
paratroopers and the electrification of subway grates by 
authorities 
but the rumors are not confined to the student movement 
within one week various sources reported that communist party 
chief zhao ziyang had resigned returned to power and then was 
forced out again 
other rumors said premier li peng and three other conservatives 
had seized power then there was the story that li and senior 
leader deng xiaoping had stepped down and that president yang 
shangkun a former general was poised to stage a coup 
a government source said someone he know in the state council 
chinas cabinet told him li had resigned and that the resignation 
would be broadcast on staterun television that night 
i called the tv station and a friend there started laughing 
it just wasnt true but this thing came from the state council 
he said 
zhang weiguo a reporter on the world economic herald a 
relatively liberal newspaper based in shanghai said the rumor mill 
shows how badly china needs a freer press 
people are learning about major government changes and about 
the biggest student movement in chinas history from popsicle 
sellers and newspaper dealers he said this is not a way to 
inform the people 
indeed after several days in early may when the official media 
gave lively objective reports about the student movement the press 
has returned to somber reporting pockmarked with an occasional 
shrill editorial calling for stability

president bush once again is relying on 
liberal democrats to protect his savings and loan bill from attacks 
by members of his own party 
the legislation cleared another hurdle wednesday on its way to 
the house floor for a vote next month but a gop amendment that 
critics said would have crippled bushs proposal to make sampl 
owners put up more of their own money narrowly escaped passage by a 
1717 tie promising future challenges 
we have no illusions that well have to fight the capital 
issue again again and again said assistant treasury secretary 
david mullins the administrations point man for keeping bushs 
package intact its like one of those cheap movies the monster 
keeps coming back 
bush and other critics have blamed thrift operators risky and 
often fraudulent lending using federally guaranteed deposits 
without exposing much of their own money to possible losses for 
the 90 billion hole in the government sampl insurance fund that 
necessitated the bailout 
in the past this industry has repeatedly won capital fights 
in the congress mullins said thats one of the reasons were 
here today 
the legislation as approved by the house banking committee and 
the senate and endorsed by bush would require sampl owners to put 
150 of their own money at risk for every 100 of federally 
insured deposits they lend 
under the house banking panels version that hardcash capital 
requirement would rise to 3 for every 100 in outstanding loans by 
june 1990 
the latest assault on the proposal came from an amendment by 
rep henry hyde rill during the house judiciary committees 
consideration of the bill 
the measure would make federal regulators go through a lengthy 
series of hearings before imposing the proposed new standards on 
about 450 sampls that enjoy socalled supervisory good will 
exemptions from the current capital requirements 
federal regulators granted the exemptions in the early 1980s to 
thenhealthy institutions that agreed to take over and absorb the 
losses of unhealthy sampls to minimize payouts from the federal 
insurance fund 
hyde argued that its unfair to change the rules in the middle 
of the game he warned that 152 institutions will have to be 
considered insolvent unless they are permitted to continue counting 
good will as capital 
youre taking institutions that are treading water and headed 
toward shore and youre drowning them he said my amendment 
says you get a chance at due process before we hold the 
funeral im trying to make an honest lady out of my government 
however defenders of bushs proposal argued that capital has no 
more value than air in insulating the insurance fund and taxpayers 
from poor lending practices 
the capital standards the president proposed and are in this 
bill are our insurance policy said rep charles schumer dny 
this amendment would cripple the bill and make it a 
laughingstock 
eleven of the committees 14 republicans and six democrats 
supported hydes amendment one vote shy of the simple majority 
needed for approval three republicans and 14 democrats voted no 
while the committees chairman rep jack brooks dtexas 
abstained 
strong capital survived mullins rejoiced afterwards 
but rep henry b gonzalez dtexas who as chairman of the 
house banking committee has been the administrations main 
legislative spear carrier on the capital issue was worried about 
the closeness of the call 
the vote points to the need for more work to let members 
know the seriousness of the problem before the legislation reaches 
the floor said gonzalez 
in other action the judiciary committee adopted an amendment 
offered by rep william j hughes dnj that he said was 
designed to avoid a court challenge of civil penalties for bank and 
sampl fraud 
the bush administration had proposed maximum civil fines for 
fraud by individuals and institutions of 1 million a day for any 
one violation up to a total of 5 million 
hughes measure cutting in half the maximum for individuals 
passed by a 1714 vote but the committee later adopted his 
subsequent proposal throwing out the caps for both individuals and 
institutions but limited the penalty to double any loss and 
expense to the government 
the committee defeated by voice vote an attempt by hughes to 
halve the maximum proposed jail term for financial institution 
fraud from 20 years to 10 years

the struggle to rid china of official corruption 
has been a galvanizing force behind the phenomenal outpouring of 
support for the prodemocracy student movement 
bespectacled office workers and elderly women in baggy trousers 
say they are all for democratic reform but what really angers them 
is nepotism and guandao the official corruption they must deal 
with every day 
mao sent his son to korea deng sends his children to 
america goes one popular slogan which by the contrast accuses 
todays communist party leaders of furthering their own interests 
instead of serving the public 
one of mao tsetungs sons died in the korean war while several 
of senior leader deng xiaopings children have had extended stays 
in the united states 
ordinary chinese view with helplessness and rage the power of 
high officials to send their sons and daughters abroad obtain good 
housing and cars and buy amenities 
common people often cannot buy a train ticket or a good 
television unless they know the right people the back door is 
the most common entrance for getting many goods and services and 
everything comes with a price ranging from gifts of cigarettes 
and free meals to cash bribes 
officials access to soughtafter goods has made them 
susceptible to bribery many consider receiving money lavish 
banquets color television sets or stereos all part of the job 
newspapers regularly report how officials stockpile scarce goods 
such as fertilizer and steel buying them up at artificially low 
stateset prices and selling them for huge profits on the free 
market 
despite a government crackdown last year many officials still 
use their positions to set up companies that distribute for a 
healthy profit hardtoget raw materials and resources 
one of the first posters to go up at beijing university during 
the student upheaval listed several dozen senior officials who it 
alleged got their jobs because of family connections 
premier li peng it noted was the adopted son of the late chou 
enlai peoples liberation army chief of staff chi haotian is 
president yang shangkuns soninlaw 
a recent survey of 10000 workers found that 46 percent listed 
corruption as chinas most serious social problem and 63 percent 
said improper deeds by party members was a major political problem 
chinese courts handled 37000 cases of official profiteering 
last year up 50 percent from 1987 and 101 embezzlers and 
bribetakers were sentenced to death or life imprisonment 
local governments have set up neighborhood centers where 
ordinary people can report official abuses of power without fear of 
recrimination 
but most agree that corruption is here to stay until china 
alleviates imbalances in supply and demand and closes the wide gap 
between subsidized stateset and free market prices

healthy americans can now add a fourth egg to 
their weekly menu and still stay within american heart association 
recommendations for a lowcholesterol diet 
heart association officials say the diet recommendations havent 
changed but that what is known about eggs has new tests show that 
eggs are not as rich in cholesterol as previously believed 
dr john larosa a george washington university clinician and 
chairman of the american heart associations nutrition committee 
said wednesday that the ahas dietary guidelines were revised after 
new tests by the us department of agriculture showed that egg 
yolks average 213 milligrams of cholesterol instead of 274 as 
previous tests showed 
the aha recommends that dietary cholesterol should be limited to 
300 milligrams a day previously the heart group had said healthy 
americans should limit egg consumption to just three a week 
under the new measurements larosa said four eggs a week could 
now be consumed by healthy americans and still meet the ahas 
guidelines 
new measurements on the eggs cholesterol levels were announced 
last week and larosa said wednesday at a meeting on dietary fats 
that the aha was revising its egg recommendations 
the aha decision comes as good news to an egg industry that has 
suffered from a growing american awareness of the effects of 
dietary cholesterol 
industry figures show that egg sales in the us dropped by a 
billion dollars from 41 billion to 31 billion between 1984 
and 1988 industry officials have blamed the decline on changes in 
dietary patterns 
officials at the aha conference emphasized that the new heart 
association guidelines of four eggs a week apply to people with 
healthy cardiovascular systems the guidelines still call for 
patients with elevated cholesterol levels or heart disease to avoid 
eggs and other foods rich in cholesterol or saturated fats 
the announcement noted that the four eggs include invisible 
yolks consumed in baked and other prepared foods 
larosa in a news conference at the conclusion of a twoday aha 
conference on dietary fats said the rest of the dietary guidelines 
recommended by the heart association for three decades remain in 
effect and are finding more support by other scientific 
organizations 
they have been adapted by almost ever body that has looked at 
nutrition in the last few years the guidelines have stood the test 
of scientific scrutiny he said 
recent studies by the national academy of science and the us 
surgeon generals office have been consistent with the heart 
association guidelines 
the aha conference on dietary fats came to no firm consensus on 
the value of omega3 fat from fish oil a substance that some 
studies have suggested is able to reduce cholesterol levels in the 
blood substantially 
we have lots of data but not enough yet to know what the 
picture looks like on fish oil said larosa 
he said there are not yet enough studies to prove conclusively 
the benefits of a diet rich in omega3 fats which are commonly 
found in the oils of cold water fishes 
dr scott grundy director of the university of texas center for 
human nutrition in dallas said we are not at the stage where we 
can generalize the benefits of fish oil for the public 
i think it holds great promise but we dont yet know the 
direction the research will take he said 
nonetheless d m hegsted of the harvard medical school said a 
sensible diet better include a serving of fish once a week 
other elements in the aha dietary guidelines include 
limiting fat consumption to less than 30 percent of the daily 
calories 
limiting saturated fats to 10 percent of the calories these 
fats come from red meats butter whole dairy products coconut and 
other palm oils 
limiting cholesterol intake to 300 milligrams or less daily 
having carbohydrates such as breads pasta beans fruits and 
vegetables account for half or more of dietary calories 
limiting sodium intake to three grams a day or less 
limiting alcohol consumption to one to two ounces daily

a state official whose nomination for a top 
federal post has run into trouble with antiabortion forces spent a 
rocky 4 years as head of the oklahomas largest agency before 
switching jobs 
robert fulton took over as director of the states department of 
human services amid controversy and left as criticism of his 
administration grew in the legislature 
his critics questioned his administrative capabilities and 
accused him of replacing a legislative patronage system with a one 
of his own 
fultons supporters say he is a hard worker gifted in putting 
together programs and obtaining federal dollars but one backer 
said he is an eternal optimist prone to promise more than he can 
deliver 
for the past two years he has been social services secretary a 
member of gov henry bellmons cabinet serving as liaison with 
human services 
fulton 57 had a long federal career before coming to oklahoma 
working for five agencies over 21 years including the us senate 
budget committee 
now us health and human services secretary louis sullivan 
wants him to return to washington to head the family services 
administration which manages major welfare programs 
but his nomination has come under attack by some conservative 
republican senators because of a old policy at an oklahoma state 
hospital regarding the treatment of infants with crippling spina 
bifada 
fulton was named as a defendant in a 1985 lawsuit alleging that 
from 1977 to 1983 several babies born with the severe spinal defect 
were denied livesaving surgery at the state hospital 
fulton said the deaths occurred before he became human services 
director in 1983 and he took steps to improve treatment for spina 
bifida babies he was recently dropped as a defendant 
in a recent interview he said antiabortion forces have their 
axes out for louis sullivan and ive become their symbol he said 
he couldnt change their minds if i laid down in front of 15 
abortion clinics across the country 
sullivans own nomination ran afoul of antiabortion advocates 
when he indicated in an interview earlier this year that he 
personally opposed abortion but favored womens right to choose 
fulton had a difficult task ahead of him when he came to 
oklahoma to succeed the late le rader who ruled the department 
of human services with an iron fist from its infancy and was 
considered one of the states most powerful figures 
he was an institution said fulton i didnt go in and 
purge rader people because that is not my style i thought my job 
was to be something of a healer and i tried to do that 
but i was obviously not a loyd rader i could not play those 
games with the legislature like he could and i ran into some flak 
his 4 years as human services director covered a time of severe 
budget restraints caused by a collapse in the oil industry in 1983 
state sen bernest cain chairman of the senate human services 
committee said fulton is is brilliant in understanding the 
interaction of state and federal programs and dollars 
he also was an extreme optimist cain said 
he said fultons optimism may have led him to tell legislators 
that he could get by on less funding than the agency really needed 
and that caused some problems 
a few months after fulton took over the post a huge revenue 
shortfall hit state government forcing cutbacks at human services 
in the next two years the work force was slashed from about 
14500 to about 12500

president bushs cautious response to israels 
plan for palestinian elections in the occupied territories fell 
short of the state departments wholehearted approval 
the election proposal constitutes an important contribution to 
a process that has the potential to bring about negotiations 
leading to limited palestinian selfrule bush told israeli defense 
minister yitzhak rabin in a meeting wednesday 
the proposal gives us something to work with and we are now 
looking for a constructive arab response to it said the white 
house statement released following the meeting 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler who spoke 
shortly before bush and rabin met was more enthusiastic referring 
to the plan put forward by israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir 
she said we are wholeheartedly supportive of his election 
proposals we want to work with the israelis and the palestinians 
to move the peace process forward 
tutwilers comments marked the first time the bush 
administration has expressed unreserved backing for the election 
proposal set forth seven weeks ago the state department reserved 
judgment on other aspects of the israeli plan 
a state department official said he had not seen the white house 
statement and could not comment on the difference in tone between 
the two statements 
bush also voiced his deep concern over the escalating violence 
in the occupied territories and expressed the strong hope that all 
parties would exercise maximum restraint according to the 
statement 
rabin appealed to bush to help israel enlist support among arabs 
and palestinians for the israeli election plan 
my impression is the united states would like to assist israel 
in finding the partner among the palestinians in the territories to 
move ahead along the outlines of the peace process rabin told 
reporters outside the white house he did not say what steps bush 
urged israel to take

first elected to congress in 1954 wright is a new deal democrat 
who represents the district around fort worth texas wright was 
elected house majority leader in 1976 which put him in line for 
the speakership after thomas p oneill stepped down in 1986 
potential opponents for the speakers post stepped aside 
recognizing wright already had the votes among his democratic house 
colleagues 
but wright drew criticism from those colleagues once in the job 
some accused him of a tyrannical leadership style others said his 
oldfashioned pompous rhetorical style wasnt in step with the 
times didnt represent the democrats well on television and 
provided the opposition with an easy target 
wright took the lead in forging a central american peace plan 
but he drew fire from house members on the touchy issue of a 
congressional pay raise giving in to public pressure and forcing 
members to go on record with a vote a move that killed the big 
pay raise proposal

twenty percent of residents of a georgia county 
got sick two years ago from drinking the public water supply 
demonstrating that germs can get through the standard purification 
process a study concludes 
investigators from the us centers for disease control in 
atlanta tracked the cause of the outbreak of intestinal illness in 
carrollton county in the first two months of 1987 the culprit was 
a microscopic parasite called cryptosporidium 
they estimated that 13000 of the 64900 residents of the county 
got sick from drinking the public water supply 
the researchers found that the microbe got through the countys 
filtering and purification system even though it met standards set 
by the us environmental protection agency 
a report on the investigation directed by dr edward b hayes 
was published in todays new england journal of medicine 
the county gets its water from a small river that runs through 
pastureland the researchers speculated that lowlevel 
cryptosporidium infection in cattle and an overflowing sewer pipe 
may have allowed the microbe to get into the river 
the parasite is highly resistant to chlorine which kills other 
germs 
the cdc investigators said their results demonstrate that 
cryptosporidium can contaminate filtered public water systems 
even when the water quality is within regulatory limits for 
coliform bacteria chlorine and turbidity 
in an editorial dr betty olson of the university of 
california irvine said the report is a dramatic and important 
reminder of the countrys need to keep a vigilant eye on its water 
supplies

the national transportation safety board says 
the federal aviation administration should act immediately to 
improve air traffic procedures in the crowded skies over southern 
california 
the ntsb which conducted a special probe into the incident 
said wednesday that controller errors contributed to a feb 13 
incident in which two planes flew too near each other 
the investigation into air traffic in that region cited a 
variety of problems including excessive overtime poor training 
and understaffing of controllers 
the ntsb believes that these safety problems warrant immediate 
attention and corrective actions by the faa to prevent a diminished 
level of safety in the high traffic density of the southern 
california basin area the board said in a 22page letter to the 
faa 
the february close call occurred when a british airways jumbo 
jet and an american airlines plane were misdirected and passed 
closer to each other than federal rules permit 
the study noted that nine errors have been committed in the 
chief control facility in the past 14 months 
southern california was the site of the nations last major 
midair crash which killed 82 people in august 1986 over the los 
angeles suburb of cerritos 
the ntsb noted that the faa has been aware of personnel and 
equipment problems at the los angeles coast terminal radar approach 
control facility for at least three years 
the safety board believes that numerous deficiencies and 
problems have contributed directly or indirectly to the increase in 
operational errors and that this increase should serve as a warning 
or precursor to a potential accident the ntsb said

by advertisers and telephone merchandisers who use computers to 
dial phone numbers at random could endanger the public health and

the lawmakers said wednesday the intrusive sales pitches on 
facsimile machines use up the receivers paper and that for mobile 
and pagerphone users often make the recipient pay for the calls 
on top of that citizens have a right to privacy said rep 
barney frank dmass the author of one of three bills that would 
restrain the use of junk fax advertising and computer 
autodialers 
the subcommittee chairman rep edward markey dmass said 
unsolicited telemarketing increasingly crosses the line between 
helpful and unacceptably obtrusive 
each day they are used by more than 180000 solicitors to call 
more than 7 million americans unfortunately these machines are 
often programmed to dial sequentially whole blocks of numbers

a bill requiring colleges to disclose how many 
of their athletes graduate could improve education standards for 
student athletes a congressman and former pro basketball player 
says 
rep tom mcmillen dmd a sponsor of the studentathlete 
right to know act called the effort a relatively innocuous

parents with valuable information about the school they are 
considering 
mcmillen played for the university of maryland before playing 
professionally with the atlanta hawks and washington bullets 
in testimony submitted wednesday to a house subcommittee he 
said the disclosure bill itself will not ensure that athletes get

the primary goal of educating young people and to developing basic 
standards for studentathletes

washington ap federal rules may be necessary to protect 
americas elderly from ripoffs because private nursing home 
insurance is so poorly regulated by states the general accounting 
office says 
in a report prepared at the direction of 88yearold rep claude 
pepper the gao said many states allow insurers to sell policies 
with less protection than recommended by model plans developed by 
the national organization of state insurance commissioners 
while such provisions can result in lower policy premiums 
they can adversely affect policy holders by decreasing the 
likelihood that needed services will be covered and increasing the 
risk of policy terminations for reasons other than nonpayment of 
premiums the report said

california has become the first state to ban the sale of 
semiautomatic assault weapons but a similar bill in the louisiana 
legislature was killed in committee 
californias legislation signed into law wednesday by gov 
george deukmejian bans the sale of 55 semiautomatic assault 
rifles pistols and shotguns beginning jan 1 but they allow 
people who currently own those weapons lawfully to keep them if 
they register with the state 
theres no question its a defeat for gun owners and for us 
richard gardiner of the national rifle associations washington 
dc office said of the signing but i think the backlash will 
be greater than the spread of similar bills while its a 
tactical loss strategically its going to be a big help 
the legislation was prompted by a jan 17 attack at a stockton 
elementary school in which a deranged man with an ak47 assault 
rifle killed five children and wounded 30 other people before 
taking his own life 
deukmejian said he wasnt surprised or worried about gun owners 
ensuing threats to recall him for signing the measures adding that 
he also would sign pending legislation requiring a 15day waiting 
period for all gun sales there is already a waiting period for 
pistols 
in louisiana gun control proponents said a similar bills 
failure to gain approval wednesday was the result of rural 
legislators who did not appreciate the problems of violent crime in 
new orleans and other metropolitan areas 
the louisiana houses committee on criminal justice deferred 
action on the bill which would have required registration of 
semiautomatic assault rifles 
lawmakers said it was unlikely the sportsmans paradise 
would adopt any gun legislation this year 
sarah brady whose husband james was wounded in the 1981 
assassination attempt on thenpresident reagan praised 
deukmejians action 
were very pleased with the bill mrs brady head of 
handgun control inc said during an appearance in philadelphia 
its significant because people statewide came together and 
realized this issue is becoming less and less political and more 
necessary 
she said believes president bush eventually will sign a 
permanent federal ban on the domestic manufacturing and sale of 
assault weapons 
bush recently banned importation of such weapons 
gardiner scoffed at claims that the california legislation would 
spread across the states noting that guncontrol advocates made 
similar statements in 1981 after the town of morton grove ill 
passed a handgun ban in the wake of the shootings of singer john 
lennon reagan and pope john paul vi 
theyve said it every time they passed a bill and its never 
happened gardiner said after morton grove three little 
neighboring cities passed bans but what was important was that a 
whole passel of states passed legislation prohibiting cities from 
taking such action

jim is a dedicated person he is honest said maybelle 
gregory a longtime democratic activist its pure and simple 
politics 
its getevenfortower time added bob collins a patron at 
the white elephant saloon in the fort worth stockyards 
the house ethics committee is investigating 69 charges that the 
democratic congressman violated the congressional ethics code 
his attorneys reportedly proposed an arrangement wednesday under 
which wright would step down from the speakership if the most 
serious ethics charges were dropped 
but wright 66 denied that hes considering resigning and vowed 
to press ahead 
all of these people who are out there accusing him of things 
have done the same things he did said diane emling of nearby 
euless i just wish people would leave him alone 
ms emling and several other regulars at angelos barbecue 
restaurant in fort worth were pondering wrights political fate as 
they drank beer wednesday night 
they jump on a whipping dog and they get with it said

congressional career citing wrights push for military contracts 
that benefit fort worth manufacturers and his efforts to keep 
carswell air force base in the city vance also said wright was a 
key player in the decision to locate the super collider in texas 
like others vance blamed much of wrights predicament on 
partisan politics which he said was enhanced by the tower 
rejection 
i think it almost feeds on itself vance said it to a 
certain extent is partisan just as the john tower thing is 
partisan 
texas attorney general jim mattox said it would be a tragedy 
for texas if wright stepped down as speaker

moderately today while the dollar declined against the japanese 
yen after gaining 856 yen since may 11 
the dollar closed at 14235 yen down 065 yen from wednesdays 
14300yen close the currency opened at 14260 yen and fluctuated 
in a wide range of 14145 yen to 14260 yen 
the basic tone of todays trading was speculative investors 
dollarselling said mitsuhiko kinugasa a trader with daiwa bank 
he said a rumor that the bank of japan might raise its official 
discount rate by 075 percentage points also encouraged yenbuying 
japanese market sources and news media have speculated that the 
central bank would raise the key rate by at least 05 percentage 
points from the present 25 percent but monetary authorities have 
made no official announcement higher interest rates in japan would 
tend to make the yen more attractive to investors 
but the release of the wholesale price index which showed 
only a modest increase in may made investors think japanese 
economic growth was slowing down and buy back the dollar 
kinugasa added 
the bank of japan reported that the nations wholesale price 
index rose by 02 percent in the first 10 days of may from the 
previous 10day period and 31 percent from a year earlier 
basically the market has a strong demand for the dollar even 
though some speculative players occasionally sell it like they did 
today kinugasa said 
on the stock exchange the 225issue nikkei stock average closed 
at 3400539 up 15357 points or 045 percent the index had 
climbed 3521 points the previous day 
dealers said the yens recovery reassured stock investors and 
prompted buying 
kenji ishizuka a dealer with daiwa securities said the 
wholesale price index report also encouraged buy orders 
its mainly because the figure was within their 
expectations he said 
ishizuka said the nikkeis rise also was helped by substantial 
profit increases shown in corporate financial reports for fiscal 
1988 that came out today

former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone today 
acknowledged receiving political donations from the company at the 
center of an influencepeddling scandal but testified that he was 
innocent of any wrongdoing 
in longawaited testimony before parliament nakasone said he 
received 235000 in political donations from the recruit co from 
1982 to 1987 
it was his first public acknowlegement that he accepted 
political donations from the information and publishing 
conglomerate but he said the contributions were reported according 
to law 
i am totally innocent nakasone told the budget committee of 
the house of representatives i refused to testify earlier 
because i have never done anything wrong 
opposition leaders contend nakasone prime minister from 1983 to 
1987 played a central role in the scandal that has seriously 
shaken public confidence in government they demand his resignation 
from parliament 
nakasone refused to step down saying i will continue my job 
to make a contribution to my country 
while the former prime ministers voice was heard in a national 
televivion broadcast cameras flashed only still pictures of a 
grimfaced nakasone during more than two hours of testimony by 
law tv cameras are banned at parliament sessions during testimony 
of special witnesses 
nakasone had acknowledged that three of his aides bought a total 
of 29000 recruit shares and that profits from their sale after the 
issue went public were used for political activites 
he testified that sale of the shares had reaping the aides about 
450000 
recruit had sold unlisted shares in a subsidiary to scores of 
people prominent in government and business including at least 17 
politicians or their aides the buyers made large profits when the 
shares went on public sale 
eleven of the 17 were members of nakasones cabinet 
during questioning by seiichi inaba a member of the opposition 
japan socialist party nakasone denied personal involvement in the 
stock purchases these were economic acts by the individuals who 
purchased them he said 
for months the opposition has demanded testimony in parliament 
from nakasone who was prime minister at the time of dubious stock 
deals and large political contributions by recruit 
the governing liberal democrats refused until last week calling 
the demands improper because of nakasones status as a former 
prime minister 
a long opposition boycott of debate on the budget changed that 
liberal democrats forced the budget through the house of 
representatives last month but widespread criticism resulted and a 
deal was made the opposition would not boycott the budget in the 
upper house if nakasone testified before the budget committee 
prosecutors have so far arrested 14 bureaucrats and businessmen 
in the scandal on charges involving bribery and violations of 
securities laws they have also filed charges against two members 
of parliament 
on monday prosecutors charged lawmaker takao fujinami a 
nakasone lieutenant and former chief cabinet secretary with 
bribery in the scandal 
tsuruo yamaguchi secretarygeneral of the socialist party the 
largest opposition group has accused nakasone of doing recruit a 
special favor that involved ordering nippon telegraph and telephone 
co and the ministry of posts and telecommunications to buy 
multimilliondollar us supercomputers 
two of the supercomputers made by cray research inc were resold 
to recruit and helped establish it in leasing computer time and 
related telecommunications services 
hisashi shinto former chairman of nippon telegraph and 
telephone which was a government monopoly until 1985 was arrested 
and accused of taking bribes from recruit in the form of the 
bargain stock shares 
the opposition also wants to know whether nakasone recommended 
hiromasa ezoe the former chairman of recruit for membership on 
several government advisory committees 
in a survey published today support for the governing party 
slipped to an alltime low 
according to a survey of 2280 eligible voters conducted last 
weekend by the masscirculation yomiuri shimbum support for the 
liberal democrats stands at just 265 percent the lowest since its 
founding in 1955 while combined support for five opposition 
parties stands at 267 percent the survey said 441 percent of 
those polled supported no party

public schools must provide education for all 
handicapped children no matter how severe the disability or how 
little they might benefit a federal appeals panel has ruled in 
reversing a lower court 
the ruling wednesday by the threejudge panel of the 1st us 
circuit of appeals was in a new hampshire case but it could affect 
public schools and handicapped children throughout the country 
judge hugh bownes wrote the decision that reversed a ruling last 
year in us district court in new hampshire 
the appeals court said the 1975 education for all handicapped 
children act mandates an appropriate public education for all 
handicapped children regardless of the level of achievement that 
such children might attain 
the judges also said a school district has a duty to provide 
an educational program for every handicapped child in the district 
regardless of the severity of the handicap 
the case began in 1974 with a complaint filed in the federal 
court in new hampshire on behalf of a boy identified as timothy w 
the complaint alleged his rights under federal and new hampshire 
law were violated by the rochester nh school district when it 
said the boy was not eligible for special education 
at later hearings the boys mother and therapists testified 
that timothy could hear see bright light and respond to music 
touching and talking 
but a developmental pediatrician testified timothy did not 
have educational needs and could not benefit from an education 
the district court ruled last july that federal law mandates 
that before a child receives a special education a determination 
must be made whether the child will benefit from it 
the court concluded that timothy could not be educated 
the appeals court remanded its ruling to the district court 
until the school district develops a suitable individualized 
program for timothy 
rochester school superintendent raymond yeagley said the appeals 
court decision will force the school district to shift resources 
from students who could benefit from education and focus them on 
less capable students 
school districts are getting to the point they are asked to do 
everything and spend more on education services than education 
said gwendolyn gregory deputy general counsel of the national 
school boards association in washington 
the association had filed a brief in support of the rochester 
school district 
ms gregory said the appeals court decision could make a school 
liable for such medical services as physical therapy that could be 
considered education 
but lorraine greiff spokeswoman for the massachusetts office of 
handicapped affairs hailed the decision 
i think its terrific how can you prove who is going to 
thrive and who isnt she said 
ronald k lospennato the new hampshire lawyer who represented 
timothy and the disability rights center said it simply 
reinforces what the education act said all along that all 
handicapped children are entitled to an education 
they shouldnt have to fight to get in the schoolhouse door

the congress of peoples deputies is new but the 
method of counting votes is as old as communist rule 
president mikhail s gorbachev presiding over the initial 
debate and several procedural votes at todays inaugural session of 
the 2250member body promised to speed up the process but not 
in time for this session 
since the communists came to power in 1917 balloting has been 
by show of hands at party meetings delegates traditionally raise 
their party cards members of the legislature the supreme soviet 
vote with a forest of hands 
by custom such votes simply endorse the decisions of the 
leadership making precise counts unnecessary 
the tradition started to falter only within the last year 
but as wrangling broke out today at the start of the 
longawaited session of the countrys first competitively elected 
congress it became apparent the old way would be quite 
timeconsuming 
opposition to the leadership emerged even on procedural 
questions 
who is for this agenda gorbachev asked as the body 
considered the plan adopted by a closed caucus wednesday night 
most of the 2155 deputies present raised their delegate cards 
who is against he asked when only a smattering of cards 
appeared in the cavernous auditorium gorbachev began counting 
aloud he gave up when he reached 31 and asked for an official 
count 
a 10minute pause ensued as representatives of each sector in 
the hall counted votes by hand the tally was 379 against with nine 
abstentions 
gorbachev declared the agenda adopted but there was grumbling 
among the deputies and he called for another show of hands of those 
opposed 
do not get excited he said i know what to do i can see 
that this is the minority i think we are not going to count this 
time there is an absolute majority the agenda is adopted 
after several more vote counts the president told the delegates 
that an electronic counting system would be installed 
soon he said very soon

more arrests are possible in the sexual 
attack of a mentally retarded teenager who was assaulted with a 
baseball bat and broomstick by five boys as eight others watched 
authorities said 
five high school students from the affluent suburb of glen 
ridge including the cocaptains of the football team were 
arrested wednesday the eight who apparently watched the attack 
also were glen ridge high school students between 16 and 18 years 
old authorities said 
we are satisfied that this was a nonconsensual sexual assault 
by these five males against this young woman essex county 
prosecutor herbert tate said at a news conference she didnt 
understand the nature and quality of her actions 
police said the other eight students are being investigated 
although none has been charged the group includes the son of the 
glen ridge police lieutenant who initially handled the 
investigation according to wnbctv and the new york daily news 
when the detective discovered that his son was one of the eight 
teens who allegedly was present and did not intervene he took his 
son in for questioning and notified his superiors according to the 
published reports he then reportedly was removed from the case and 
it was turned over to essex county authorities 
the hourlong assault took place march 1 after the students and 
the girl met in a glen ridge park and went to the nearby home of 
the football players charged in the case 18yearold twins kevin 
and kyle scherzer authorities said the scherzers parents were 
not at home authorities said 
the girl who has since turned 18 was assaulted in a basement 
room with a small baseball bat and a broomstick tate said there 
was no sexual intercourse police said 
rumors of a gang rape had circulated throughout the small town 
for weeks and some parents said they were angry at the long delay 
in making the arrests 
why werent parents told asked marcia mann whose daughter 
is a sophomore apparently a lot of kids knew all the sordid 
details there was bragging going on in the halls 
the arrests were made a day after wnbctv reported that no 
arrests had been made despite the time that had passed 
i think there was a coverup said josh golin a 17yearold 
senior until the media got called this was going to be kept 
quiet until it blew over 
tate said the nbc report was not a fact just that the 
investigation took time 
kevin scherzer is charged with one count of conpiracy to commit 
sexual assault and two counts each of aggravated criminal sexual 
contact and aggravated sexual assault said assistant prosecutor 
robert d laurino 
kyle scherzer and peter quigley 18 each were charged with 
conspiracy and two counts of aggravated sexual assault laurino 
said 
quigley was accused of cheering on the assault although tate 
would not give details 
the three were released on bonds a 17yearold male and another 
student who has since turned 18 were charged as juveniles in all 
three counts tate said 
two juveniles appeared in family court said ray weiss a 
spokesman for tate details of that appearance were unavailable 
since those proceedings are closed to the public weiss said 
the girl attends a special education program at west orange high 
school and participates in extracurricular activites in glen 
ridge a community of about 8000 located about five miles 
northwest of newark 
school officials declined comment but issued a statement that 
said school administrators had become aware of the attack through 
informal reports

three of the soviet unions finest ice hockey 
players are now free to play with the national hockey league the 
official tass news agency reported today 
the announcement that vyacheslav fetisov igor larionov and 
sergei makarov were discharged wednesday from the red army whose 
hockey team they represent in the soviet league capped months of 
unprecedented public squabbling within the world champion hockey 
team 
tass said the three were discharged owing to reduction of 
staff in the red army and are now free to sign contracts with 
nhl or any other foreign clubs 
the agency did not mention the squabbles in its brief dispatch 
and it was unclear how much of their hardcurrency earnings the 
players would be permitted to keep if they sign nhl contracts as 
expected 
other soviet athletes competing internationally have been 
required to turn over a share of their earnings or winnings to 
soviet sports organizations 
larionov last year publicly criticized the methods of national 
team coach viktor tikhonov in a long article in the weekly 
ogonyok larionov complained of rigorous training inadequate 
compensation and a lack of debate and discussion in the team 
fetisov quit the national team after a public row with the coach 
over the treatment of his players the two reconciled before the 
world championships in stockholm in late april 
the soviets won the title but lost one of their best young 
players alexander mogilny who defected to the united states 
the defection of mogilny who has been contracted to play with 
the buffalo sabres prompted speculation in moscow that the soviets 
would block freedom for other players to play for foreign teams 
todays announcement did not specify whether fetisov larionov 
and makarov would continue to play for the soviet national team 
fetisov is a standout defenseman and makarov and larionov are 
star forwards on the soviet team 
the new jersey devils have contract rights on fetisov the 
vancouver canucks on larionov and the calgary flames on makarov 
there was no immediate reaction from the three players

script writing in hollywood is the 
domain of white men and with a shift toward young white men 
according to a survey conducted by the writers guild of america 
the survey found female and minority writers and writers over 
age 40 receive fewer job offers and less pay for the meager scripts 
they can sell the study was issued wednesday by the writers guild 
of america west 
the alliance of motion picture and television producers rebutted 
the survey saying in a statement that it appears to contain 
inaccurate information and certain of the conclusions do not appear 
to be supported by industry data 
the producers group also noted that more than 97 percent of the 
wgas membership is white 
richard frank president of the disney studios also disputed 
some of the findings of the wga which singled out disney as having 
the worst record of hiring minority and female writers 
frank admitted though that the company could improve its 
minority hiring practices i think we have to do better he 
said i think its all of our problem and we should address it 
the wga leaders were less diplomatic calling the pattern of 
hiring prejudices morally repugnant 
the statistics contained in this report are simply 
unacceptable said brian walton executive director of the wga 
west inaction in the face of these continuing realities would be 
a disgrace to our industry 
the employment survey of wga wests 6400 members shows that 
women writers earn 63 cents for every dollar collected by their 
male counterparts 
minorities account for 2 percent of film and television authors 
and older scriptwriters once paid a premium for their screenplay 
experience now earn less than their younger colleagues it said 
wga board member mort thaw said it was inconceivable that 
scriptwriting experience now should be considered a detriment to 
a career he called the discriminatory hiring practices morally 
repugnant and legally accountable 
television programs not using any writers over age 40 were the 
popcorn kid st elsewhere the charmings and 
moonlighting by comparison more than 85 percent of the 
writers on dallas dynasty and the colbys were over age 
40 
yet the wga said it would not seek to remedy the situation 
immediately with legal action walton said a classaction lawsuit 
against the studios would be expensive and perhaps ineffective 
at the same time guild leaders said that the wgas 1989 
hollywood writers report reflected an irrefutable pattern of bias 
a 1987 survey by the screen actors guild concluded that limited 
film and television casting of black and hispanic actors did not 
reflect the ethnic mix of the united states 
typically youre going to find most of your black writers on 
black shows said vida spears a black writer who sits on the wga 
board youre just not called in to other shows 
the study surveyed major film and network syndicated and cable 
television production from 1982 to 1987

a suspicious fire destroyed the landmark pan 
pacific auditorium the streamlined art deco arena where elvis 
presley made his west coast debut and sonja henie skated during the 
1930s officials said today 
the auditorium vacant since 1972 once boasted the worlds 
largest indoor ice rink and was host to the ice capades 
the fierce fastmoving fire broke out shortly after 7 pm 
wednesday and burned for about two hours 
fire officials said the blaze may have been started by 
transients 
the building has been abandoned for several years and sealed 
up as far was we know the power is cut too and there is and no 
reason to assume natural causes said assistant fire chief tony 
ennis 
the building which boasted a dramatic multipillared facade 
was listed on the national registry of historic buildings it also 
featured prominently in the recent film miracle mile an action 
thriller about nuclear apocalypse 
virtually everyone performed there said mike venema a 
public relations man who noted that presley gave his first west 
coast performance there in 1956

the finest examples of art moderne in existence its considered a 
landmark piece said venema who was working on behalf of a

investigators

white house officials are putting a belatedly 
upbeat cast on moscows latest weaponsreduction proposal despite 
skepticism voiced by president bush toward soviet intentions 
bush in a commencement address at the coast guard academy in 
new london conn on wednesday greeted soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachevs latest proposal for conventional arms reduction with 
faint praise 
the soviets are now being forthcoming and we hope to achieve 
the reductions that we seek bush said 
but he said sovietbloc nations still maintain a massive 
advantage in conventional forces in europe he said various 
soviet promises to cut troops and tanks in eastern europe are not 
enough to erase that superiority 
white house chief of staff john sununu said today on cbs this 
morning that if mr gorbachev gets his levels down to a point 
where the offensive and sudden strike capability of the soviet 
union is gone then at that point you can begin negotiations 
while bush was still on the platform handing out diplomas to 
graduating cadets his national security adviser brent scowcroft 
was telling reporters backstage that there are good signs here 
past proposals by gorbachev had been vague scowcroft said 
he called the new soviet proposals outlined in vienna on 
tuesday at an armsnegotiating session very promising and 
said theyve put more meat on it 
asked if there had been a change in the administrations 
assessment scowcroft said no its a matter of appearance the 
president felt he appeared too negative before so hes trying to 
appear more positive now 
bush leaves friday for europe where he is to attend a nato 
summit meetng due to open monday in brussels 
in advance of that session the soviets virtually accepted 
western demands that ceilings be set on troop levels in each east 
european country as well as on soviet forces overall bush 
administration officials said 
the officials also said gorbachev agreed to negotiated limits on 
soviet troops in czechoslovakia east germany hungary and poland 
and to an overall limitation on the red army 
however bush made little direct reference to these proposals in 
his new london speech even though his text was revised shortly 
before he delivered it well after the soviet offer was publicized 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater also sought after 
bushs speech to portray the new soviet offer in a positive light 
fitzwater praised the apparent willingness by the soviets to 
accept two central principles they had rejected previously an 
overall limit on the number of tanks artillery and personnel 
carriers and a natosuggested rule limiting each country to no 
more than 30 percent of the total 
those are major major concessions fitzwater said 
asked why his and scowcrofts tone appeared to be more upbeat 
than bushs fitzwater said we all want to have the same tone 
in his speech bush said gorbachevs proposed reductions even 
if implemented are not enough to eliminate the numerical 
superiority that the soviet union enjoys right now 
later fitzwater said bushs reference to gorbachevs 
unilateral reductions largely dealt with earlier statements by 
the soviet leader not the new proposal 
bush chose to mention it in the new london speech because its 
still a part of the whole scheme of things fitzwater said 
if white house aides were trying to sound encouraging about the 
new soviet offer they were less optimistic about resolving a 
dispute that has split nato on whether to negotiate reductions in 
shortrange nuclear weapons 
scowcroft asked if there had been progress in reconciling west 
german support for such talks with us resistance to them said 
not measurably 
he said that although talks are continuing time is running 
out to settle the dispute before the nato summit 
bush in his new london speech said it is still necessary to 
maintain a strong nuclear deterrence and he challenged gorbachev 
to disclose accurate figures on soviet military spending open 
the ledger bush said 
the president also took note of the prodemocracy demonstrations 
in china saying his administration will do all it can to 
encourage those who are speaking the language of democracy and 
freedom 
the coming 16nation nato summit seemed certain to be dominated 
by gorbachevs new proposal for limits on conventional forces 
however bush in an interview with a group of european 
journalists appeared to issue a warning to western allies against 
being lulled by the force of gorbachevs arguments 
while giving the soviet leader high marks for public relations 
bush declared you do not make foreign policy based on the 
personality or charm of an individual in another country you do it 
on facts 
bush was interviewed by reporters from news organizations from 
britain west germany italy and belgium

a judge has ruled suffolk county cannot 
enforce its ban on plastic packaging until it studies the potential 
effect on the environment 
supreme court justice jack cannavo on wednesday stayed the law 
which would ban stores from packaging food in polystyrene or 
polyvinyl the law which was to go into effect july 1 is opposed 
by plastics manufacturers and food merchants 
wednesdays ruling requires the county legislature to file a 
complete environmental impact statement which takes about three 
months 
the judge ruled that suffolk county legislators failed to comply 
with state environmental law when they approved the measure last 
year after saying it would have do no significant harm to the 
environment 
the law would ban grocery bags coffee cups eating utensils and 
fastfood containers made from either of the two plastics similar 
bans have been adopted in st paul minn minneapolis berkeley 
calif and portland ore 
advocates of such bans say the nondegradable nonrecyclable 
plastics take up too much space in landfills and might release 
harmful emissions if incinerated 
in a lawsuit filed last year however the society of the 
plastics industry and manufacturers of plastic food packaging said 
paper products are a greater environmental threat than the plastic 
items they would replace 
they said that paper products dumped in landfills could pollute 
ground water as the paper products decomposed 
suffolk county attorney paul sabatino said the county may appeal

arab leaders extended their summit an 
extra day as they sought agreement on a strategy to resolve the 
conflict in lebanon and on whether to support plo chief yasser 
arafats peace moves 
traditional foes iraq and syria remained at loggerheads over the 
presence of syrian troops in beirut as foreign ministers attending 
the summit began drafting a final summit communique today they 
were to consider three separate resolutions drafted by egypt saudi 
arabia and jordan 
syrias president hafez assad told a marathon session wednesday 
night that he is willing to withdraw the 15000 syrian soldiers in 
the lebanese capital if an arab force replaces them but some of 
the arab leaders reportedly do not want to send troops to syrias 
warplagued neighbor 
the extraordinary summit called mainly for the ceremonial 
return of egypt following a 10year ostracism for making peace with 
israel has turned largely into a quarrel over lebanon 
kuwaits foreign minister sheik sabah ahmed sabah has 
indicated his country wants to stop presiding over the sixnation 
league committee designated to find an arab compromise in lebanon 
conference sources said 
heads of state met for 5 hours wednesday night but made no 
headway in resolving the bitter dispute between syria and iraq 
syria supports lebanons moslem acting prime minister salim hoss 
against his christian rival gen michel aoun 
iraq is the only outspoken arab supporter of aoun 
the syrian soldiers are among 40000 syria deployed in lebanon 
under an arab league peacekeeping mandate christian lebanese and 
their backers say damascus broke that mandate by siding with 
moslems in recent sectarian fighting that has killed at least 359 
people 
at wednesday nights meeting assad chided his fellow arabs for 
their inability to act on promises to dispatch a multinational arab 
peacekeeping force to beirut the syrian leader threatened to leave 
beirut with only a lebanese garrison or no garrison at all 
conference sources said assad argued bitterly with iraqs saddam 
hussein through most of the session basically assad accused 
hussein of backing the antimoslem christians while hussein 
accused assad of introducing iranians into lebanon one source 
said 
most arab countries including powerful saudi arabia egypt and 
jordan reportedly are leaning toward the iraqi position this 
leaves syria in need of a compromise or facing isolation in the 
arab world 
despite the arguments the 22nation league summit has brought 
some spectacular reconciliations particularly between libyas 
leader moammar gadhafi and egypts leader hosni mubarak 
the egyptian president told a moroccan television interviewer 
the readmission of the arab worlds most populous state will 
undoubtedly help to bring the arabs together 
syria also challenged on wednesday night the palestine 
liberation organizations recognition of israel and the plos offer 
to negotiate peace with the jewish state all the other arab 
leaders seem to accept plo leader yasser arafats move as 
unpleasant but inevitable sources said 
president bush has sent a message expressing hope the summit 
will support peace initiatives from israel and arafat 
the summit originally scheduled to end wednesday was to end 
with a public session late today 
tunisias president zine abidine ben ali and djiboutis hassan 
gouled aptidon quietly slipped out of town wednesday to attend the 
summit of frenchspeaking countries in dakar senegal

dolphins like greta garbo want to be alone 
sometimes scientitsts have learned 
a study by the former chief of medicine at baltimores national 
aquarium says three dolphins developed ulcers shortly after 
arriving at the newlyopened aquarium eight years ago because of 
the big crowds that came to see them 
we looked at everything we thought could be stressful to them 
such as the configuration of the tank temperature being watched 
by the public light levels and noise from the pumps said 
michael k stoskopf professor of comparative medicine at johns 
hopkins university school of medicine 
the real problem with the exhibit was the people said 
stoskopf chief of medicine at the aquarium from 1981 to 1988 
kibby mimi and aphrodite developed gastrointestinal ulcers in 
1981 within 50 days of arrival in baltimore but recovered within 
six months of their being flown to the dolphin research center in 
grassy key fla in 1982 stoskopf said 
the baltimore aquariums multimilliondollar dolphin tank was 
never used for dolphins again 
the animals didnt have enough room to get away from the crowds 
stoskopf said researchers found later that by fleeing from the 
crowds the mammals congregated in a spot where noise from the 
tanks pumps was loudest 
aquarium officials spent 250000 on modications that reduced 98 
percent of the noise limited visitors to a maximum of 850 people 
an hour and set firm closing hours to assure the animals at least 
eight hours of rest every night 
the lessons learned led aquarium officials to select beluga 
whales as replacements and allow them more time to adjust to their 
new home 
the first two belugas spent a year in a quiet tank at the new 
york aquarium and were introduced slowly to larger numbers of 
people 
the belugas anore and illamar seem to be very happy said 
robert l jenkins aquarium director of operations and husbandry 
they were joined last summer by a third whale

the hezbollah is believed the umbrella group for underground 
factions holding most of the 15 foreign hostages in lebanon the 
longest held is terry a anderson 41 chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
in another incident six civilians were wounded in a sudden 
halfhour flareup with 106mm recoilless guns and rocketpropelled 
grenades between gen michel aouns mainly christian troops and 
syrian forces the clash occurred on the midcity museum crossing 
that divides beirut into moslem and christian sectors 
each side accused the other of starting the fight which 
violated a fragile ceasefire called by the arab league may 11 to 
halt the fighting between christian forces and syrian troops allied 
with druse militiamen 
the fighting broke out weeks ago after aoun ordered a blockade 
of three illegal harbors run by moslem militias 
druse warlord walid jumblatts progressive socialist party 
retaliated by shelling the christian enclave the syrians are in 
lebanon under a 1976 arab league peacekeeping mandate 
also today aoun reiterated that syria should pull its troops 
out of lebanon to facilitate israels withdrawal from the 
6to10mile border enclave under its control for almost seven 
years israel refers to the region in lebanon as its security zone 
syria says it will pull out only after the israeli army also 
withdraws aoun criticized the united states for not pressuring 
syrian troops to leave

a military judge today acquitted four 
soldiers of manslaughter in the death of a palestinian man they 
beat with a broomstick and rifle butts but found them guilty of 
mistreating the detainee 
col emanuel gross said the four members of the elite givati 
brigade should have refused orders by their superiors to punish 
detainees with beatings he said they went further than those 
instructions allowed 
the case was seen as a test of the armys willingness to 
discipline soldiers accused of brutality in the palestinian 
uprising 
maltreatment is a misdemeanor punishable by up to three years in 
prison sentencing was set for june 15 
the soldiers none older than 21 were accused of beating to 
death 42yearold hani elshami on aug 22 while conducting an 
arrest in the jabaliya refugee camp in the occupied gaza strip 
gross found that they inflicted blows indiscriminately for 
about 15 minutes hitting the man all over his body with rifle 
butts and a broomstick one soldier jumped from a bed onto 
elshamis stomach he said 
but he said the cause of elshamis death was not that beating 
but a second beating administered by unknown soldiers at a military 
base 
the judge said the investigation was so poorly conducted it was 
doubtful the soldiers who actually administered the fatal beating 
could be identified 
had the defendants pvts yitzhak kibbudi aryeh luchato and 
ron hakhel and 1st sgt yitzhak adler been convicted of 
manslaughter they could have received up to 20 years in prison 
the judge also acquitted an army doctor david nussam of 
negligence related to his treatment of elshami after the beating 
the verdict did not make any judgment on the policy of beating 
and the army withheld comment on whether charges would be brought 
against the defendants superiors 
beatings became widespread after defense minister yitzhak rabin 
in january 1988 authorized soldiers to beat palestinian rioters to 
prevent violent demonstrations 
commanders said many soldiers initially felt they were required 
to break bones to punish rioters but this was later clarified and 
the number of beating cases fell significantly 
the often brutal use of clubs has brought widespread criticism 
of israel especially after pictures of soldiers beating 
palestinians were shown on foreign television news programs 
the state department has criticized israel as failing to bring 
soldiers who mistreat detainees to trial or being too lenient in 
punishing them 
in testimony at the trial in march the army chief of staff lt 
gen dan shomron acknowledged the armys policy was unclear and 
left many gray areas open to soldiers discretion 
deterrence is not the goal overcoming violence is shomron 
testified but when someone stops resisting thats a matter of 
opinion 
gross in his 100page verdict reviewed the policy which 
allows soldiers to beat palestinians to disperse demonstrators or 
in pursuit of troublemakers he said beating is to stop when a 
palestinian is in custody 
defense lawyers contended the troops had been following orders 
given by a field commander whom they said should bear 
responsibility for any wrongdoing 
gross said the soldiers commander had told them they could beat 
palestinians after arrest as punishment 
the order given to them was manifestly illegal the judge 
said the beating of someone who disturbs order for the purpose 
of deterrence is not a military need it is punishment 
the soldiers sat quietly through the twohour reading of the 
verdict and hugged their families afterward 
hakhels sister shira 19 said she thought the trial was often 
unfair i think the trial was very hard she told reporters 
i think they just took them to set an example these soldiers are 
just kids 
the soldiers were among 67 officers and soldiers charged with 
crimes ranging from assault and battery to manslaughter since the 
start of the 17monthold palestinian uprising 
excluding the givati soldiers 36 of the troops have been found 
guilty and received a maximum punishment of 21 months in jail 
three others were acquitted cases of the others are still in 
progress

spurred by criticism from asian 
americans the university of california at berkeley announced plans 
today to put more weight on academics in admissions and also open 
new spots for the poor 
the proposal adds the poor to the list of groups given special 
consideration said robert l bailey a member of the committee 
that drafted the proposals special consideration already is given 
on the basis of race ethnicity and other factors 
if approved by the administration the policy changes will take 
effect by the fall of 1991 
the changes were proposed in part because of complaints that 
current policies discriminate against asian american applicants 
changes in 198384 withdrew automatic admission for all 
academically eligible students who were also poor a program that 
had benefited many asian students said sociology professor and 
committee chairman jerome karabel 
the new proposal would restore that policy 
asian americans make up about 26 percent of berkeleys 
undergraduates in california 328 percent of asian high school 
graduates meet uc academic requirements compared with 158 percent 
of whites 5 percent of hispanics and 45 percent of blacks 
under the proposal the proportion of freshmen admitted on the 
basis of outstanding academic records alone would be raised from 40 
percent to 50 percent 
another 45 percent would be selected from among groups given 
special consideration whether on the basis of race ethnicity 
income or other factors these students would still have to meet uc 
academic standards 
the proposal also would reserve 5 percent of the freshman spaces 
for socioeconomically disadvantaged students including blacks 
hispanics indians athletes and the disabled reentry applicants 
typically older women would also get special consideration 
there will be more disadvantaged white and asian students on 
the campus karabel said the addition of the economic 
disadvantage category is in addition to affirmative action based 
on race not in place of it and will not lower the number of 
underrepresented minorities on campus he said 
the number of applicants to berkeley has increased dramatically 
since 1981 with more than 20000 people applying for 3400 
freshman slots each year

foreign minister nguyen co thach today 
predicted that vietnamus relations will be normalized by 1990 
after vietnam has ended its military occupation of cambodia 
the united states has repeatedly stated that relations with 
vietnam would be normalized after complete withdrawal of vietnamese 
troops from cambodia he said 
i am of the opinion that the united states will keep the words 
of a big country the sooner it is normalized the better and it 
is better late than never thach said in an interview with the 
associated press 
asked to predict when relations would be normalized he said a 
reasonable guess would be next year it is the end of the tunnel 
now we can get out of the tunnel he said of the cambodian 
conflict 
the key player in any peace agreement is guerrilla leader prince 
norodom sihanouk who has failed to fashion a deal in several 
rounds of negotiations with the vietnaminstalled government in 
cambodia 
thach said sihanouk often has changed his behavior and tactics 
but always had the same objective to be head of state in 
cambodia since the provietnamese government has now offered him 
that post thach said i dont think he will miss the 
opportunity 
the united states has not recognized the communist government 
that has ruled since defeating the usbacked south vietnam 
government in april 1975 the carter administration came close to 
normalizing ties in the 1970s but that fell apart after vietnam 
invaded cambodia in late 1978 
the united states which supports the resistance guerrillas has 
said it would not consider ending its trade and aid embargo or 
normalizing ties until the last vietnamese troops leave vietnam 
has pledged to withdraw its remaining 60000 to 70000 troops by 
sept 30 
us ties are crucial to vietnams top priority of drawing the 
aid and investment to develop its economy one of the worlds 
poorest 
the united states and vietnam in recent years have made rapid 
progress on humanitarian issues including the resettlement of 
refugees and migrants to the united states and resolving the fates 
of us soldiers missing in action in vietnam 
private us citizens also have substantially increased contacts 
arnold schecter a leading american researcher said on 
wednesday that vietnam is allowing him to open an office in a hanoi 
medical school to study the health effects of agent orange the 
herbicide us forces sprayed on vietnam during the war 
it is something of a breakthrough vietnam now is very 
different and relatively easygoing compared to the extreme rigidity 
that used to be there said schecter 
schecter of the state university of new york at binghampton 
just ended a visit to vietnam

andreas hillgruber a controversial 
german historian and catalyst of acrimonious debate on the 
historical perspective of the holocaust died this month after a 
long illness cologne university said today he was 64 
hillgruber a cologne university professor and prolific author 
gained respect among historians around the world for his detailed 
works on adolf hitlers rise to power and the nazi dictators 
foreign policies 
the university said he died may 8 
over the past three years hillgruber was involved in bitter 
arguments among west german academicians over how best to 
historically interpret the holocaust in which 6 million jews were 
killed 
hillgruber supported the view that historically speaking the 
holocaust while certainly atrocious could not be singled out as 
generally different from other atrocities such as josef stalins 
reign of terror in the soviet union 
in a controversial 1986 book titled the destruction of the 
german reich and the end of european judaism he also praised the 
german armys desperate lastditch attempt in 1945 to fend off 
soviet troops saying that gave civilians time to flee from 
revenge organs of the red army 
hillgruber also argued that the allies decided to crush germany 
long before they knew of nazi atrocities 
the book sparked anger among some west germans with many 
newspapers calling it a scandal 
but fellow historians say hillgruber will long be respected for 
his earlier work 
he was an excellent historian particularly on hitlers 
political and military plans which were the basis for hitlers 
program to conquer the world said reinhard meyers a historian 
at muenster university 
some of hillgrubers other works include the second world war 
193945 goals and strategies of the great powers the 
destruction of europe and hitlers strategies policies and 
leadership from 194041

for greater autonomy today welcomed their governments reported 
willingness to negotiate a ceasefire 
thailands army chief gen chavalit yongchaiyudh said 
wednesday that burma has accepted in principle a thai proposal to 
mediate peace talks 
there has been no immediate comment from the rangoon government 
which late last year began intensifying its offensive against the 
rebels 
a bangkokbased official of the national democratic front which 
combines 10 ethnic minority rebel groups and claims to control half 
of burma said the group does not trust the rangoon government of

take that chance he said 
maybe with the pressure of the outside world or mediators 
there can be something coming out that is positive said the 
official 
a representative of the karen national union the largest 
guerrilla group said a ceasefire is no problem we are ready 
but we cannot believe in killers both officials asked not to 
be named 
rangoons troops have been hitting particularly hard at karen 
bases along the thai frontier their offensive drew criticism from 
us sen daniel patrick moynihan dny who charged the burmese 
army attacks rebel bases without regard for the presence of 
civilians 
in a statement received in bangkok today moynihan welcomed 
thailands offer to mediate in the worlds oldest civil war 
it is my hope that thailand will play a neutral and 
constructive role and will quickly facilitate a ceasefire 
among the warring parties moynihan wrote he said negotiations 
eventually should lead to free elections and discussions about a 
federated union 
bangkoks proposal came after burmese troops saturday intruded 
into thailands northern tak province to attack a karen base the 
soldiers occupied a thai village and burned its marketplace before 
being forced back 
burmas army commander lt gen than shwe told the thai 
delegation on tuesday he regretted the incursion but he also asked 
bangkok not to allow insurgents to take refuge in thailand 
bangkok hopes to expand trade with burma in line with prime 
minister chatichai choonhavans campaign to turn southeast asian 
battlefields into marketplaces

if anyone will operate this train from this locomotive it will be 
me

the satirical magazine private eye appealed 
today for help in fighting a record 942000 libel judgment 
a jury on wednesday ordered that sum paid to sonia sutcliffe 
wife of a mass murderer known as the yorkshire ripper because 
of private eyes false report that she sold her story to a tabloid 
newspaper for 392000 after carousing with its reporters at a 
hotel 
the award is the highest given by a jury in a british libel suit 
ian hislop the magazines editor admitted the report was 
incorrect but said the magazine would go bankrupt if it had to make 
the payment 
by launching an appeal in this way we are making it clear that 
we are fighting this absurd award which we want overturned 
hislop told a news conference he was accompanied by actorcomedian 
peter cook a major owner of the 200000circulation magazine 
peter sutcliffe was jailed for life in 1981 for killing 13 women 
and attempting to kill five more mrs sutcliffe 38 was not 
implicated and since has separated from her husband 
we shall apply for a speedy hearing hislop said as we 
understand it this will mean a retrial if the damages are not 
substantially reduced then it looks as though we will have to 
bankrupt the company 
he said he believed a fair settlement would have been about 
24000 
the amount awarded by the jury hislop said was 100 times the 
average compensation paid to three of sutcliffes victims 
private eye first alleged in 1981 that mrs sutcliffe had made a 
deal with londons daily mail newspaper in 1983 it repeated the 
allegation this year after she sued it published two more 
articles that mrs sutcliffe said implied she knew about her 
husbands crimes 
during the trial private eye conceded there was no deal with 
the daily mail but argued that mrs sutcliffe had negotiated with 
newspapers and was prepared to capitalize on her husbands crimes 
the previous british libel award record was 831000 awarded to 
novelist jeffrey archer in 1987 against the daily star a london 
tabloid newspaper that alleged he gave money to a prostitute he 
said he never met her

square prompted an embarrassed soviet union to try to buy us 
computers on the black market to bolster its air defenses a 
federal official charged

the allegation wednesday after a federal grand jury indicted five 
people and two companies on smuggling charges

million worth of sensitive computer equipment which was seized by 
us authorities before it was shipped overseas he said

provided the basis of the governments case obrien said eddy 
haak told investigators that others in the network told him they 
were working on behalf of east bloc countries to smuggle the 
computers into the soviet union the customs agent said

they found that it was ineffective and in disrepair obrien 
said they discovered this when a west german pilot landed in red 
square 
west german mathias rust then 19 penetrated soviet air 
defenses in a small plane in 1987 buzzed the kremlin and landed 
the aircraft before a startled crowd in red square soviet 
authorities imprisoned him for 14 months

the government today unveiled an 
ambitious plan to clean up the dutch environment by the year 2010 
but it said 80 percent of the nations forests may die even if the 
measures are put into effect 
the 250 pages of pollutionfighting measures are likely to be a 
major issue in september elections controversy surrounding them 
brought down the government headed by premier ruud lubbers 
the proposals will be taken up by the new government after the 
elections 
if passed the government would spend about 29 billion yearly 
by 1994 on the program which aims to clean up the heavily polluted 
dutch environment by 2010 that expenditure would come on top of 
the 35 billion already spent annually on environmental programs 
said environment minister ed nijpels 
the package is expected to cost the average dutch household 13 
a month he said 
but even if the government meets the targets set by the plan 
only 20 percent of dutch forests will be saved the document warned 
environmental groups criticized the plan as mopping up water 
from a running faucet and said it was inadequate 
the plan cited acid rain caused by car exhaust emissions 
coalburning power stations and the farming industrys fertilizer 
production as major causes of pollution in the netherlands 
its recommendations include removing 7000 toxic waste dumps 
scattered around the netherlands cutting pesticide and fertilizer 
use by 50 percent and slashing industrial discharges by 75 percent 
it said the emission of aciditycausing chemicals must be cut by 
at least 70 percent 
for the second successive day dutch television broadcast an 
official appeal for drivers to leave their cars at home as 
pollution reached a dangerous high authorities were considering a 
complete driving ban according to the network 
lubers christian democrats had hoped to include among the 
measures the elimination of breaks for longdistance commuters but 
the ruling coalitions junior partner the liberal party objected 
to the measures and the subsequent battle split the government

the dixie brewing co the deep souths last 
major independent beer maker has filed for bankruptcy protection 
to keep city tax officials from closing the 82yearold brewery 
the chapter 11 petition filed late wednesday apparently will 
allow the company to continue operating while it reorganizes its 
finances workers were seen entering the brewery this morning 
dixie received a letter tuesday from the city giving it 24 hours 
to come up with 375000 in overdue sales and property taxes or 
shut down 
stewart walker the citys chief administrative officer said 
the city had no way to arrange a compromise on the unpaid property 
taxes 
city spokeswoman jinx broussard on wednesday said new orleans 
cannot grant an alcohol permit if a company has outstanding 
obligations 
basically the city right now is just doing what it has to do 
under the law if they dont have an alcohol beverage permit they 
cant operate she said 
earlier this month the city gave dixies husbandandwife 
owners joseph bruno and kendra elliott an extension to pay water 
bills of 215000 
new orleans once had 13 breweries providing an estimated 3000 
jobs 
dixie survived prohibition by dabbling in ice cream sodas and a 
nearbeer named dixco when prohibition ended dixie established 
itself as the frontrunner among new orleans beers 
but in 1975 phenol fumes given off by a new flooring material 
in the brewerys cellar seeped into the brewing water and gave the 
beer a bad taste beer drinkers switched to other brands and dixie 
sales plummeted never to recover 
dixies share of the local beer market which once topped 20 
percent has dropped to less than 1 percent the brewery employs 
about 100 workers

a regional court today sentenced a 
white expoliceman to hang for killing seven blacks and an indian 
man in two shooting sprees he took pride in and viewed as the start 
of a race war 
justice louis harms said there were no extenuating circumstances 
to spare barend strydom 23 from the gallows 
the killings were committed in an unfeeling and coldblooded 
manner that i have never before experienced or heard of harms 
said mass murder or racial murder will not be tolerated by this 
court 
the case has been one of the most dramatic in south africa with 
relatives of the black victims and white extremists supportive of 
strydom crowding into pretoria supreme court over the past 10 days 
to hear detailed testimony about the defendants racist beliefs 
after the sentencing the whitesupremacist boerestaat party 
announced the start of a campaign to seek clemency for strydom the 
party leader robert von tonder described the defendant as a 
sensitive afrikaner patriot 
after standing impassively for an hour while the judge read his 
ruling strydom gulped a glass of water when the sentence was 
pronounced 
he strode into the packed courtroom smiling broadly waving to 
friends and shaking hands with supporters after the sentencing he 
was escorted swiftly to a police van and driven to a death row cell 
at pretoria central prison 
the judge convicted strydom last week of killing seven people 
and wounding 15 blacks in a rampage on the sidewalks of downtown 
pretoria on nov 15 
a week before the pretoria killings strydom killed a black 
woman and wounded another at a squatter camp in what he described 
as a practice attack to determine if he was ready for a 
largerscale massacre 
strydom had acknowledged that he smiled as he shot his victims 
telling the court im a friendly person 
the judge gave strydom eight death sentences plus 30 years in 
prison for 16 counts of attempted murder no execution date was set 
police vehicles blocked streets leading to the court scores of 
officers stood guard inside and outside the courtroom packed with 
about 100 spectators more than 200 people most of them black 
waited in a small park across from the courthouse 
strydom had testified that he had fired the first shots in a 
war of freedom on behalf of whites threatened by the countrys 
black majority id do it again he told the court 
his father also a former policeman testified that he believed 
blacks were animals not humans 
both father and son belong to the afrikaner resistance movement 
a neonazi group that seeks to establish a whitesonly state other 
members of the movement attended the trial to show solidarity with 
strydom 
psychiatrists appointed by the state concluded that strydom was 
sane and responsible for his actions strydoms lawyer johan 
englebrecht argued wednesday that the defendants guilt was 
lessened by various factors including the racist ideology he 
learned from his father 
however the prosecutor paul fick said south african judges 
repeatedly had ruled that political motives could not be accepted 
as extenuating circumstances 
under south african law the death sentence is mandatory in 
murder cases unless the judge determines that there were mitigating 
circumstances 
also today three black men in pretoria prisons death row were 
hanged bringing to 24 the number of executions this year 
those hanged were simon mbatha 35 convicted of murdering two 
white policeman in march 1987 patrick mosomi sentenced last year 
for murdering a black woman and abraham mngomezuluh who was 
convicted of killing a black man in soweto in 1987

the navy has not reported at least three 
accidents involving nuclear weapons according to documents 
released by an environmental group and an interview with a retired 
admiral 
in the most thoroughly documented case a raging fire aboard the 
uss belknap in the mediterranean sea in 1975 came within 40 feet of 
nuclear weapons aboard the missile cruiser according to a military 
cable released by the greenpeace environmental group 
joshua handler director of the greenpeace nuclear free sea 
campaign said at a news conference today that pentagon 
authorities record on public disclosure of naval accidents is as 
bad as their accident record itself 
despite the disclosures the navy maintained its policy of 
refusing to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons on its 
vessels 
the admiral who commanded the carrier task force to which 
belknap belonged confirmed the incident and told the associated 
press that he had witnessed two additional accidents that 
threatened nuclear weapons aboard ships 
i have seen firsthand a live nuclear weapon caught in a fuel 
fire i have seen a nuclear weapon crushed in a hoist an elevator 
that carries nuclear weapons to the flight deck said retired 
rear adm eugene carroll who commanded the task force that 
included the belknap 
the military does not announce every time they have had a 
dicey accident they do so when the knowledge becomes public 
carroll said 
in one case he said fire broke out on the hangar desk of an 
aircraft carrier and the crew battled the fire spraying water 
on an airplane carrying a nuclear bomb trying to keep it cool 
until they could get the thing off 
in the three accidents he said we never faced the danger of 
nuclear explosion the warheads are configured in such a way 
they a fire could not cause a nuclear detonation but it could 
spread a lot of radiation around 
he declined to disclose further details of the elevator and 
aircraft fire incidents but was willing to discuss the belknap 
accident because greenpeace released a previously classified 
document describing the event 
the collision in the mediterranean between the belknap and the 
aircraft carrier uss john f kennedy was widely reported but the 
navy did not note the nuclear aspect of the accident at the time or 
in lists released in 1981 and 1986 of incidents involving nuclear 
weapons 
william arkin a naval analyst working with greenpeace said 
the navys purposeful exclusion of the belknap accident is a 
violation of the publics right to know 
eight sailors were killed and 46 were injured when the belknap 
and the kennedy collided 70 miles off sicily on nov 26 1975 
a cable written by carroll hours after the accident alerted 
superiors to the high probability that nuclear weapons on the 
missile cruiser were involved in fire and explosions subsequent 
to the collision 
aviation fuel from the carrier rained down on the cruiser 
knocking out its firefighting equipment 
it was pretty hairy out there as we viewed the belknap it 
seemed to be a fairly total involvement as it turned out the fire 
gutted the midships carroll said 
the destroyer uss claude v ricketts came alongside in heavy 
seas and driving rains and helped extinguish the fire the 
commander of the ricketts robert c powers said in a 1976 article 
published in the us naval institute proceedings 
carrolls cable stamped secret said that an unknown number 
of w45 warheads were aboard the cruiser and alerted the atlantic 
command of high probability that nuclear weapons on uss belknap 
were involved in fire and explosions subsequent to the collision 
the cable said officers aboard the kennedy had no direct 
communications with belknap at this time no positive indications 
that explosions were directly related to nuclear weapons no repeat 
no kennedy weapons involved fires on belknap diminishing at this 
time 
it also said casualties recovered thus far show no repeat no 
exposure to radiation but that monitoring teams and medical 
personnel alerted possibility of contamination 
a man who identified himself as a former sailor from the belknap 
said today he had suffered severe burns fighting the fire and had 
been checked for radation for the next three years by navy doctors 
no traces of radiation were found said the sailor who telephoned 
the associated press after reading accounts of the disclosures 
carroll now deputy director of the liberal center for defense 
information in washington said the idea that this is a broken 
arrow never released is incorrect i sent subsequent messages that 
the nuclear weapons were not endangered a broken arrow is an 
accident involving nuclear weapons 
arkin said other documents showed that there were six w45 
warheads used by terrier antiaircraft missiles aboard the 
belknap he said he based his 40foot estimate on photographs of 
the damaged ship carroll said that estimate was correct 
the ship severely damaged was decommissioned returned to the 
philadelphia navy yard and recommissioned after four years of 
repair work 
the navy responding to arkins report said no nuclear weapons 
were involved in the fire and adhered to its policy of refusing to 
comment on reports of nuclear weapons aboard vessels 
it is us government policy neither to confirm nor deny the 
presence of nuclear weapons on ships aircraft or us military 
installations said lt bruce cole a navy spokesman that 
policy applied in 1975 as it does now 
cole confirmed that the belknap was capable of carrying terrier 
antiaircraft missiles a weapon that can be armed with nuclear or 
conventional warheads but said the 1981 department of defense 
report is correct in that no nuclear weapons were affected by the 
1975 belknapkennedy collision 
on may 8 arkin and greenpeace disclosed that a hydrogen bomb 
accidentally lost off the carrier uss ticonderoga in 1965 was 80 
miles off okinawa now part of japan rather than more than 500 
miles from land at sea in the pacific as disclosed in the 
pentagons 1986 list of accidents involving nuclear weapons

the instigator of the ethic charges that have 
house speaker jim wright fighting for his political life said today 
that wright should not be permitted to make a political deal to 
resolve the case against him 
rep newt gingrich the georgia republican who parlayed his 
ethics campaign against wright into gingrichs election as house 
minority whip said wright either should fight the charges to their 
conclusion or resign from congress 
he does deserve his day in court gingrich said on abctvs 
good morning america program he deserves a full and fair 
opportunity to defend himself if he wants to end the process he 
can do that by resigning from congress but if hes going to stay 
i dont think that any kind of political deal should be made 
the house ethics committee adjourned wednesday until june 1 
after reportedly refusing to accept a deal offered by wrights 
attorneys in which the committee would dismiss the most serious 
charges against wright in exchange for his resignation as speaker 
if wright resigned from congress without such a deal the 
investigation would end because the committees jurisdiction 
extends only to members of congress but wright would not be able 
to claim exoneration on any of the charges 
gingrich said in an interview wednesday night that the 
committees refusal to accept the deal leaves wright with only 
three options resign from congress fight the charges to the end 
or step aside in favor of an interium speaker who would not be a 
threat to his job should he be exonerated by the committee 
but the notion that he has some standing to go in and plea 
bargain with the ethics committee is nonsense he said 
gingrich said he was not involved directly in any of the 
negotiations wednesday but he said his impression of the talks was 
that a very clever effort was made to run something through the 
committee before the committee had time to think about it and 
examine all of the ramifications 
he said the committees decision to adjourn until june 1 sends 
a very powerful signal that it does not intend to negotiate 
with wright over the charges pending against him 
gingrich is facing an ethics complaint filed by rep bill 
alexander dark after gingrich initiated the investigation of 
wright the complaint still pending before the committee contends 
that a partnership created by gingrich to promote his 1984 book 
window of opportunity violated house rules

the kgb said today it has evidence that three 
british journalists expelled last week engaged in spying it was 
the first time the soviets had published detailed accusations 
against the three 
competent organs possess information that testifies to the 
involvement of these journalists with british intelligence 
services kgb spokesman vladimir strunin told a news conference 
the british journalists jeremy harris of the british 
broadcasting corp ian gloverjames of independent television news 
and angus roxburgh of the sunday times have denied wrongdoing 
gloverjames and roxburgh could not immediately be reached by 
telephone to comment on the kgb charges harris declined comment 
until he had read the tass news agencys report on strunins 
allegations 
on saturday the journalists along with eight british diplomats 
based in moscow were given 14 days to leave the soviet union 
britain said the move was revenge for britains decision on friday 
to expel 11 londonbased soviets eight diplomats and three 
journalists accused of spying 
the most serious accusation leveled today was against roxburgh 
the kgb accused him of trying to enlist a soviet citizen to obtain 
information on unspecified government installations 
to this end roxburgh gave him equipment for listening and 
recording telephone conversations and also promised to pay a 
monetary reward for information that was interesting to him the 
kgb spokesman alleged 
strunin said the listening device was disguised as a household 
appliance and could be also used to capture lowfrequency magnetic 
fields generated by telephone lines cables and computers 
roxburgh also was accused of violating regulations that restrict 
foreigners travel in the soviet union 
in particular roxburgh allegedly traveled to the southern 
resort city of yalta in july without giving the required 48 hours 
advance notice to the foreign ministry 
soon afterward roxburgh was detained during an attempt to 
enter a closed area in the moscow region the kgb charges said 
harris on several occasions tried to enter zones closed to 
foreigners according to the allegations there is information 
that he used technical means for the gathering of information in 
those areas 
gloverjames was accused of demonstrating on numerous 
occasions a heightened interest in installations of a military 
character that is unjustified for a journalist 
he was also accused of repeatedly violating the regulations on 
foreigners travel in soviet territory 
since the expulsions the soviets have said the number of 
britons allowed to work in moscow will be cut from 375 to 205 the 
number of soviets permitted to work in britain 
in a separate tass dispatch leonid kravchenko the official 
soviet news agencys general director denied that the tass london 
correspondent was involved in espionage and said his expulsion 
order was regrettable 
in a letter to british foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe 
kravchenko said correspondent igor peskov was a professional 
journalist not a spy 
nothing in his activities has contradicted either british or 
international law nor could they do any harm to the security 
interests of britain kravchenko said in the letter quoted by 
tass 
he said the expulsion of peskov was at odds with improved 
sovietbritish relations and could hinder future positive 
developments between the countries 
the dispatch did not mention the other two soviet journalists 
expelled

the nations air traffic controllers complain 
they are handling too many planes working too many hours and 
suffering from low morale in a system that has changed little since 
the same problems were cited four years ago a congressional report 
said today 
in short the federal aviation administration simply 
ignored recommendations for change said rep guy v molinari 
rny referring to the general accounting office study that 
showed 43 percent of controllers characterize their morale as low 
faa officials said their own surveys painted a brighter picture 
the gao study said that while most controllers were concerned 
about working conditions the increasing traffic they have to 
handle and other aspects of air traffic control that affect 
system safety and operating efficiency their supervisors were 
far less concerned 
the survey released at a house subcommittee hearing was based 
on 5098 questionnnaires filled out by controllers and supervisors 
at the faas largest facilities late last year 
molinari ranking minority member of the public works and 
transportation subcommittee on investigations and oversight said 
the results were nearly a replica of a similar 1985 gao survey 
and show that many of the problems that contributed to a 1981 air 
traffic controllers strike still exist 
more than 11000 controllers were fired for the illegal walkout 
and molinari said the system still has 3600 fewer fully qualified 
controllers than it did before the strike the faa says the work 
force totals 16464 with 9689 classified as full performance 
controllers 
molinari said the number of full performance controllers has 
dropped by 150 in the last six months 
the faa has failed in these eight years to rebuild the air 
traffic control system adequately and they have failed to heed the 
views of controllers and supervisors he said 
gao official kenneth m mead said the flight safety foundation 
concluded from the survey that the system is not unsafe but that 
the margin of safety that undefined limit beyond which the system 
would no longer be safe remains less than desirable 
the private foundation acts as a consultant to the gao which is 
the investigative arm of congress 
the faas acting administrator robert e whittington told the 
subcommittee that the agencys own surveys of controllers show some 
encouraging results he gave figures showing that most controllers 
believe their supervisors communicate honestly with them believe 
their training is adequate and believe they are treated fairly 
regardless of age sex or race 
whittington said safety records also indicate that the system 
works well 
he quoted statistics showing that runway incursions reported 
nearcollision and operations errors all decreased between 1986 and 
1988 
meanwhile the national transportation safety board said the faa 
should act immediately to improve air traffic procedures in the 
crowded skies over southern california 
the ntsb in a letter to the faa its investigation of air 
traffic in that region cited a variety of problems including 
excessive overtime poor training and understaffing of controllers

prime minister benazir bhutto has 
removed the powerful army intelligence chief who handed out 
millions of dollars in american military assistance to afghan 
rebels officials said today 
lt gen hamid gul director general of inter services 
intelligence was transferred to army headquarters in neighboring 
rawalpindi a defense ministry spokesman said on condition of 
anonymity he reportedly has been replaced by retired army general 
shamsur rahman kallu said the spokesman 
gul gave the military assistance to the afghan anticommunist 
resistance headquartered in pakistan both pakistan and the united 
states have helped finance guerrillas fighting the sovietsupported 
afghan government 
but gul came under fire from moderate afghan guerrilla groups 
for giving most aid to hardline islamic fundamentalists the 
hezbeislami led by gulbadin hekmatyar 
he was also apparently behind the guerrillas muchcriticized 
attack on the eastern afghan city of jalalabad after soviet troops 
ended their nineyear intervention in afghanistan on feb 15 
although some guerrilla leaders predicted jalalabad would fall 
quickly the fighting has reached a stalemate 
gul was appointed by pakistans late president and military 
leader mohammed zia ulhaq who was killed last year in a plane 
crash that investigators said was sabotage 
zia retired kallu the reported new army intellegence head 
after kallu suggested zia should forfeit the post of army chief of 
staff while ruling the country as president 
analysts who requested anonymity said guls removal appears to 
indicate ms bhuttos growing strength in pakistan the first 
moslem nation in modern times to be governed by a woman

most of the deputies who have come to moscow for 
the new soviet parliament are traveling by bus eating ordinary 
hotel food and must survive on about 24 a day 
in an article reflecting sensitivity to the issue of privileges 
for the powerful the communist party daily pravda said 
rankandfile representatives in the 2250member congress of 
peoples deputies arent getting special treatment despite rumors 
to the contrary 
citizens are concerned whether their representatives are 
getting special food parcels black volga sedans presents and 
special passes for the gum central department store the 
newspaper said thursday 
the newspaper made no mention of existing privileges for top 
party and government officials many of whom are members of the new 
congress president mikhail s gorbachev and other members of the 
ruling politburo are entitled to chauffeured zil limousines 
country houses access to special food packets stores medical 
care and other services not available to ordinary soviets 
lesser officials may get smaller cars and somewhat limited 
special treatment 
many successful candidates for the congress notably political 
maverick boris n yeltsin campaigned against special privileges 
for top officials 
each deputy is paid a per diem of 15 rubles pravda said 
the offered transportation is mainly by bus but a lot of 
deputies prefer to walk because hotels are located near the 
kremlin in special cases a car may be provided 
as for food pravda said it is the same as it always was at 
restaurants and buffets of the moskva and rossiya hotels 
the only perks for the deputies are free telephone calls to 
their constituencies and wellstocked book stalls the newspaper 
said 
although some deputies were violently against even such a 
small privilege pravda said others believed that it might be 
good for deputies from far places to bring a few good books to 
their small villages and towns where such books are in short supply

american doctors returning from a week in soviet 
georgia said today they believe the soviet army used a world war 
iera toxic gas against demonstrators in the georgian capital of 
tbilisi last month 
soviet officials have acknowledged that two forms of tear gas 
were used to disperse a crowd of 8000 to 10000 holding an 
allnight demonstration in tbilisis lenin square on april 9 at 
least 20 people died during and after the protest 
the american delegation from physicians for human rights a 
1300member group based in somerville said it concluded on the 
basis of interviews medical records and videotapes that a third 
more potent gas was probably used 
the group identified the gas as chloropicrin first used during 
world war i in 1916 also known as nitrochloroform it was once 
used for crowd control in the united states but is now banned 
because of its toxicity the group said 
the chemical which causes potentially lethal chest irritation 
can be used in the united states only by licensed applicators as a 
fumigant against insects the group said 
according to georgian health officials about 4000 people 
sought hospital treatment after the demonstration 
dr jonathan fine executive director of physicians for human 
rights said the delegation concluded that the majority of those 
hospitalized were probably suffering from the lingering effects of 
toxic gas exposure 
but he said there is no conclusive evidence that chloropicrin 
caused any of the deaths 
physicians for human rights was invited by andrei sakharov the 
soviet physicist and human rights activist and top georgian health 
officials to send a delegation to investigate the alleged use of 
toxic chemicals in georgia 
the delegation which spent may 1722 in soviet georgia 
consisted of a leading toxicologist dr barry h rumack director 
of the rocky mountain poison center in denver colo dr jennifer 
leaning chief of emergency services for the harvard community 
health plan in cambridge and dr ruth a barron a psychiatrist at 
mclean hospital in belmont 
the delegation met with officials of the georgian ministry of 
health and a large number of doctors who treated people injured in 
the demonstration the group also examined pathology reports of 20 
known deaths examined photographs and videotapes of the 
demonstration and inspected canisters of gas allegedly used by 
troops

former housing secretary samuel pierce today 
defended his role in a subsidy program under investigation for 
favoring wellconnected republicans saying he tried to kill the 
program and suggesting that democrats also benefited from it 
pierces comments before a congressional committee provoked an 
angry sometimes shouted exchange with rep barney frank dmass 
who charged that the former reagan administration officials was 
trying to deflect some of the blame by making irresponsible 
statements he could not back up 
pierces appearance before a house government operations 
subcommittee marked his first public comment since an investigative 
report sharply criticized the management of a department of housing 
and urban development program that provided indirect subsidies for 
rehabilitation of privately owned lowincome housing projects 
current hud secretary jack kemp suspended further awards under 
the program pending a review 
pierce who headed hud throughout all eight years of the reagan 
administration testified that he recommended congress kill the 
socalled modrehab program 
he acknowledged that department officials used their discretion 
in awarding subsidies to selected developers but he said that was 
because congress in 1984 waived requirements specifying fairshare 
allocation procedures 
the hud inspector general said his audit found a pattern in 
which former department officials and other wellconnected 
republicans received a large share of project awards either as 
developers or as consultants to developers among those cited was 
former interior secretary james watt who was reported receiving a 
300000 consulting fee on a maryland project 
pierce said the report failed to mention democrats who 
benefited he added it should be interesting to see how much 
those affiliated with the democratic party benefited from this 
program since strong and i am sure very intelligent democratic 
congresses repeatedly appropriated funding when the republican 
administration repeatedly sought to terminate it 
pressed by frank pierce said he believed democrats benefited 
but could not name any 
youve made an irreponsible staement and youre trying to 
filibuster your way out of it frank charged 
subcommittee chairman tom lantos dcalif read from a memo he 
said the inspector general sent pierce in 1988 warning him of 
problems in the program 
pierce said he had previously altered the selection process and 
did not respond to the inspector generals suggestion because the 
earlier changes needed time to work he said he followed advice of 
other aides 
those people know something too pierce said the 
inspector general is not god 
pierce said he met with watt on the maryland project but he 
said he referred watt to the appropriate office at hud and told him 
only that wed look very carefully at his project 
no promises were made to him how he got his money i didnt 
ask him that pierce said whatever he said i really paid very 
little attention to him 
the developer who hired watt on the maryland project told the 
subcommittee that watt was hired to move and unsnarl the 
bureaucracy throughout the development process 
mr watt can get phone calls returned at hud i cant said 
judith s siegel president of landex corp

syrian troops battled proiranian 
militiamen and christian army units thursday in separate clashes 
that left one person dead and 11 wounded in beirut 
lowflying israeli warplanes cracked the sound barrier over 
druseheld mountains southeast of the capital but avoided 
antiaircraft fire police said 
christian army commander gen michel aoun said syria should pull 
its troops out of lebanon to ease israels withdrawal from a border 
strip it has controlled for almost seven years 
police said militiamen of the iranianbacked shiite moslem 
hezbollah or party of god opened fire on a syrian army jeep near 
the iranian embassy in the seaside ouzai district on beiruts 
southern edge 
other syrian troops in the area fired back the gunbattle sent 
panicky residents crowding a nearby cooking gas distribution center 
fleeing said a police spokesman who cannot be identified under 
standing rules 
he said one hezbollah militiaman was killed in the 10minute 
shootout one woman a hezbollah fighter and three syrian soldiers 
also were wounded he said 
witnesses said the firefight began when the factions quarreled 
about who had priority for butane gas refills the cooking gas has 
been in short supply since artillery duels began devastating beirut 
11 weeks ago in battles between aouns mainly christian troops and 
an alliance of syrian troops and druse militiamen 
six civilians were wounded in another clash police said 
describing a 30minute firefight with 106mm recoilless guns and 
rocketpropelled grenades between aouns units and syrian troops at 
a crossing on the green line that divides the segregated capital 
shells also triggered fires in four cars near the western edge 
of the crossing and halted traffic across the divide for two hours 
the police spokesman said 
each side accused the other of provoking the clash which 
violates the latest ceasefire called by the arab league on may 11 
thursdays casualties raised the toll to 359 killed and 1399 
wounded since the fighting broke out march 8 two days after aoun 
imposed a blockade of militiarun ports south of beirut to recoup 
lost taxes of 10 million a year 
syrian gunners joined militiamen of druse warlord walid jumblatt 
in shelling the 310squaremile christian enclave northeast of the 
capital 
none of five ceasefires called by the arab league has held 
because the syrians continued to shell the enclaves coastline to 
prevent aoun receiving supplies by sea 
aoun on thursday reiterated a call for syria to withdraw its 
troops from lebanon to strip israel of any pretext for maintaining 
control of a six to 10mile border strip 
the christian leader criticized the united states for not 
pressuring syrian troops to leave 
syria first intervened militarily in lebanon in june 1976 and 
now has 40000 troops there under an arab league peacekeeping 
mandate 
aoun has declared a war of liberation to drive syria out of 
lebanon syria says it will pull out only after the israeli army 
withdraws from its selfdesignated security zone

the federal government issued a new aids 
prevention guide today specifically intended for parents and other 
adults to use in counseling young people about the disease 
too many of our young people are dying from aids and unless we 
take immediate action the epidemic will continue to spread among 
this very vulnerable population said health and human services 
secretary louis w sullivan 
the new guide is packaged in a folder containing a number of 
loose pages bundled in three categories one aimed directly at 
adults emphasizing the importance of young people learning about 
aids one with specific information on the disease itself and the 
third with material written for various age levels that parents can 
pass on to their children if they desire 
the publication is being accompanied by radio and television 
public service spots encouraging parents to call the national aids 
hotline 1800342aids if they wish to have copies mailed to 
their homes 
the prevention guide is the cornerstone of the third year of the 
public health services education campaign entitled america 
responds to aids 
i ask the people of america parents guardians and others 
to take one simple direct action to protect our childrens health 
to sit down and tell them how they prevent infection with hiv the 
virus that causes aids said sullivan 
more than 18000 of the nearly 95000 americans who have been 
diagnosed with aids were between 20 and 29 years of age when the 
diagnosis was made because a person can be infected with the hiv 
virus as long as 10 years before symptoms of aids appear 
scientists believe a significant number of people in that age group 
were infected when they were still teenagers 
dr james mason head of the public health service emphasized 
that the new guide is carefully tailored so parents can decide how 
to present the subject to their children in a way that takes into 
account each familys own values 
only you can tell your children which behaviors you think are 
responsible and proper he said 
but along with that observation he urged every concerned 
adult to order one and use it right away 
the parent who does not take the time today to teach his child 
properly could end up sitting in a hospital room watching that 
child die said mason former head of the centers for disease 
control 
phs spokesman jim brown said 500000 copies of the new guide 
have been printed in english and 100000 in spanish the television 
announcements promoting the guide have been produced in both 
english and spanish 
the guide was developed by the cdc in consultation with 
specialists in education child development health care 
biological sciences and communications 
before final publication it was tested with various groups of 
parents for readability usefulness and effectiveness 
the onepage handout included in the kit for parents to give 
to late elementary and middle schoolaged children focuses largely 
on the ways a person cannot get aids but it does state that a 
person can become infected either by having sexual intercourse 
with an infected person or by sharing drug needles or syringes with 
an infected person 
the handout written for high school students advises dont do 
drugs of any kind and delay sexual intercourse it offers 
five reasons for delaying sex including avoiding unwanted 
pregnancy 
but it goes on to say that when you decide you are ready to 
become sexually active do so only with one uninfected partner in a 
mutually faithful longterm relationship such as marriage 
it advises to avoid sexual intercourse with people who may be 
infected with hiv 
finally if you have sexual intercourse outside of a mutually 
faithful longterm relationship with an uninfected partner use a 
condom but remember that condoms are not foolproof and may break 
however use a latex condom whenever having any type of sexual 
intercourse

cornell university has suspended the 
graduate student accused of writing a software virus last year that 
infected thousands of computers hooked up to a national network 
his lawyer said today 
the new york times reported today that robert tappan morris 23 
was told he had violated the schools code of academic integrity 
his lawyer thomas guidoboni confirmed today that a letter to 
that effect had been sent to his client but he would not comment 
further 
the virus entered the national computer network known as 
internet in november and rapidly copied itself infecting as 
many as 6000 computers at universities corporations and military 
installations 
the rogue program did not destroy data but forced operators to 
shut down many computers while they purged it morris friends have 
quoted the firstyear graduate student as saying he did not intend 
to create such a problem 
in a letter to morris dated may 16 the dean of the graduate 
school and the universitys academic integrity hearing board said 
morris would be suspended until the 1990 fall semester 
dean alison p casarett said that if morris wanted to reapply 
the decision to readmit him would be made by the graduate schools 
computer science faculty 
casarett said the decision to suspend morris was an academic 
ruling and not tied to any criminal charges that morris might face 
our process was entirely separate from anything legal 
authorities might have done she said 
morris faces no criminal charges a federal grand jury earlier 
this year forwarded its recommendations to the justice department 
but the department has not taken any action 
a cornell university commission in april said that morris 
action was a juvenile act that ignored the clear potential 
consequences

the swiss armys required strength will 
be cut by 100000 men by the mid1990s and soldiers military 
service will end at age 42 instead of 50 the defense minister 
proposed thursday 
the proposals which need parliamentary approval would make the 
army leaner without losing muscle and free more people to run 
the economy and civilian sectors during a crisis said defense 
minister kaspar villiger 
the changes were proposed because of a drop in the number of 
available young soldiers and financial pressure on defense spending 
the plan was unveiled 10 days before an unprecedented popular 
proposal to disband the army takes centerstage in swiss politics 
the socialist party a member of the countrys ruling coalition 
will meet to decide its stand on the antiarmy referendum due for 
a national vote nov 26 
launched by socialists and religious groups the referendum is 
opposed by the socialists three centerright partners potential 
trouble for an alliance that has governed since 1959 and often is 
cited as a key to switzerlands political stability 
the neutral nations army a traditional pillar of society and 
highly rated by foreign experts would be mobilized from among its 
54 million citizens the government lists full mobilization 
strength at 740000 
the military reform would gradually reduce the armys minimum 
target strength to 450000 by about 1995 from 550000 today 
soldiers would have to continue periodic service after basic 
training only until age 42 instead of through age 50 the cutoff 
age for officers would be lowered to 50 from 55

the chairman of the interstate commerce 
commission resigned in tears today saying the white house and i 
have concluded it was not in our interest to fight the senate 
commerce committee 
heather j gradison a member of the commission since 1982 and 
its chairman since december 1985 offered no further explanation at 
a meeting attended by about 100 icc employees they applauded when 
she finished her brief statement 
her fiveyear term was up last december but she has remained on 
the job a source at the icc who declined to be identified said 
democratic sens ernest f hollings of south carolina and j james 
exon of nebraska have expressed strenuous opposition to her 
renomination 
i think its time to move on said mrs gradison wife of 
rep willis d gradison jr rohio 
aides said hollings and exon were not avbailable for comment 
immediately 
insiders said the dispute with the senate commerce committee 
goes back to last year when a bill to reregulate the railroad 
industry was defeated 1110 in the committee 
mrs gradison is a strong advocate of deregulation 
we have a different agency today than we had seven years 
ago mrs gradison said we have far fewer employees we 
have a healthy rail industry we have a competitive motor carrier 
industry 
the 100yearold icc has been a target of budget cutters two 
years ago the senate transportation appropriations subcommittee 
slashed the commissions budget so sharply that all employees had 
to be put on a fourday work week for four months 
the icc source said when sen jay rockefeller dwva 
introduced a bill last year to reregulate the railroad industry 
exon voted against it and that it was understood that the deal 
cut by exon was that the bill would not come up again if new people 
came on to the commission 
the source said because of the opposition to mrs gradison the 
feeling was that if her name were sent over for renomination by 
president bush there would be a difficult fight and the 
reregulation bill would be introduced again 
rather than having her personality and renomination be the 
focus of the move to reregulate the railroads the white house and 
mrs gradison decided it would be best not to get into that 
fight the source said 
mrs gradison said she will stay on until a successor is 
confirmed for the job 
her voice breaking mrs gradison said i think the time has 
come to take advantage of the free market opportunity i have talked 
about and find some for myself

the us economy grew at a 43 percent annual 
rate in the first three months of 1989 much slower than previously 
thought the government reported today 
the commerce departments estimate of growth in the gross 
national product the broadest measure of economic health was well 
below an initial estimate a month ago that put the gnp increase at 
55 percent 
the slowdown was even more pronounced when the effects of a 
rebound from last years drought in the farm sector were removed 
that rebound added 25 percentage points to growth in the first 
quarter after the drought had subtracted 11 percentage points in 
the last quarter of 1988 
thus growth in the nonfarm economy slumped to a lackluster 18 
percent in the first three months of the year down from a nonfarm 
growth rate of 35 percent in the fourth quarter and the slowest 
quarterly gnp advance in more than two years 
at the same time inflation grew at an annual rate of 5 percent 
during the januarymarch quarter unchanged from the earlier 
estimate 
the 43 percent overall gnp increase was substantially lower 
than expected in advance of todays report many forecasters were 
looking for only a slight downward revision to 54 percent gnp 
growth 
however michael evans head of a washington forecasting firm 
said the gnp report was actually good news for the economy because 
much of the weakness came from a big downward revision in the 
amount of inventories being accumulated by businesses 
while inventory growth adds to the gnp growth rate it is often 
worrisome to economists who fear that it will lead to big cutbacks 
in production in later months as companies try to get their 
stockpiles more in line with sales if the production cutbacks and 
job layoffs are too severe then an unwanted inventory buildup can 
trigger a recession 
the fact that inventories were well under control means there 
wont be a cutback this quarter evans said the economy is in 
amazingly good shape there seem to be no signs of a serious 
slowdown 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher said the federal reserves 
efforts to fight inflation by slowing growth appeared to be having 
the desired effects 
fed policy over the past year appears to be succeeding in 
steering the economy to a more moderate but sustainable growth 
path he said in a statement a more moderate pace of economic 
growth at this stage of the record expansion will assist in 
reducing inflationary pressures in the quarter ahead 
at the white house michael boskin chairman of president bushs 
council of economic advisers said its not usual but its not 
at all uncommon to see a revision in the gnp figures as large as 
that reported today 
im confident the economy will continue growth inflation will 
be contained and the economy will remain solid he told reporters 
in a separate report the national association of realtors said 
existing home sales fell by 12 percent in april to an annual rate 
of 336 million units it was the fourth consecutive monthly 
decline reflecting the fact that rising mortgage rates are 
continuing to take their toll on the housing industry 
in another report the national association of business 
economists said its latest survey projected that economic growth 
will slow dramatically this year but the nation should be able to 
forestall a recession until at least 1990 
the consensus of 54 forecasting experts surveyed by the 
association was that unemployment would rise modestly this year 
with inflation picking up as well because of higher food and energy 
prices 
the slowdown being forecast by the business economists was 
evident in todays gnp report 
even with the effects of the drought the gnp expanded last year 
at a fouryear high of 39 percent that rapid pace helped to drive 
unemployment down sharply and the overall prosperity was credited 
in part with helping the republicans hold onto the white house 
however the expansion which has lasted a peacetime record of 
more than six years is expected to slow this year under the impact 
of the credittightening engineered by the federal reserve in an 
effort to keep inflation under control 
economists say it is still an open question whether the feds 
intervention will succeed in achieving slower growth and lower 
inflation or a more severe weakening that could topple the country 
into a recession 
a price index tied to the gnp rose at an annual rate of 5 
percent from january through march reflecting higher wage costs 
for federal employees and higher food and energy prices 
the inflation advance while unchanged from the initial estimate 
a month ago was up from a 42 percent rate of inflation in the 
final three months of 1988 
the sharp downward revision in overall growth reflected in large 
part a slower buildup in business inventories than previously 
believed the commerce department said part of this reduction in 
estimated inventories came from 1 billion lower growth in the 
value of unsold autos 
this development was viewed positively by economists because it 
means automakers may not have to cut back production as sharply as 
previously believed 
the lower inventory growth was offset somethat by a 
betterthanexpected decline in the us trade deficit as measured 
by the gnp it narrowed at an annual rate of 176 billion in the 
first quarter the first quarterly improvement since the spring of 
1988 exports shot up at a 153 percent rate while imports rose a 
slight 09 percent 
in other developments consumer spending rose at a modest 11 
percent rate in the first three months of the year down sharply 
from a 35 percent fourth quarter increase 
consumer spending which accounts for twothirds of overall 
economic activity is expected to slow sharply this year 
economists thus are pinning their hopes for avoiding a recession on 
continued improvement in the trade deficit and further growth in 
business investment 
reflecting that scenario the gnp report showed that capital 
spending by businesses jumped 76 percent in the first quarter 
rebounding from a 29 percent decline in the octoberdecember 
fourth quarter 
housing construction which has been hurt by rising mortgage 
rates fell at a rate of 54 percent in the first quarter while 
government spending grew at a modest rate of 14 percent 
reflecting in part efforts to reduce the federal budget deficit 
in another report today the commerce department said the 
aftertax profits of corporations fell by 17 percent in the first 
quarter of 1989 following a 32 percent rise in the fourth quarter 
it was the biggest decline in business profits since a 25 percent 
drop in the fourth quarter of 1987 
the gnp before adjusting for inflation grew 87 percent to 
5105 trillion from january through march reflecting the first 
quarter the economy has passed the 5 trillion mark 
in inflationadjusted dollars the gnp measured 4077 trillion 
the bush administration is counting on growth to remain at a 
fairly robust level in order to reduce the federal budget deficit 
below 100 billion next year without resorting to tax increases 
the bush budget is built on economic assumptions that the gnp 
will grow at a 32 percent rate this year down only slightly from 
last years 39 percent increase 
however private analysts generally believe that forecast is too 
optimistic with many private analysts looking for growth to average 
around 28 percent for the entire year more than a full percentage 
point lower than the 1988 growth

premier li peng today denied that he called 
troops into beijing to crush a prodemocracy student movement 
chinas cabinet ordered local officials to use forceful 
measures to quell the campaign 
earlier today more than 100000 workers and intellectuals 
marched to join students in demanding lis ouster an intense power 
struggle within the political leadership appeared unresolved 
lis statement on staterun television broke a silence that 
began saturday when he imposed martial law in beijing 
he said the army had not yet entered the city because our 
government is a peoples government and our army is a peoples 
army 
over the weekend tens of thousands of people built street 
barricades to stop the armys advance on students occupying central 
tiananmen square 
the television news quoted li as saying that the thousands of 
troops surrounding beijing would only enter the city once local 
citizens understand their purpose 
he denied claims the army was called in to crush the monthlong 
student movement the largest in communist chinas 40 years 
a foreign ministry spokeswoman denied today that either 
communist party chief zhao ziyang who had shown sympathy for the 
students cause or li had lost their posts she refused to 
comment on strife within the leadership 
in a defeat for zhao long a rival of li staterun radio 
reported that 27 of 29 provinces have backed the martial law order 
the state council chinas cabinet issued a circular saying 
students had forced their way onto trains to beijing hindering 
efforts to end turmoil in the capital and disrupting railway 
operations the official xinhua news agency said 
the circular said local police and governments should use 
forceful measures to stop the students but it did not explain 
todays marchers converged on tiananmen square chinas symbolic 
center of power two days after an estimated 1 million people held 
a similar protest demanding lis ouster 
the bannerwaving procession chanted we wont stop until li 
peng steps down they also demanded the resignation of senior 
leader deng xiaoping believed to have been behind lis crackdown 
this is the first time ive demonstrated in my life said 
zhang ciling 54 a composer but today i have to express my 
feelings my country is facing a crisis 
some marchers were led by the newly formed independent union of 
beijing intellectuals teachers researchers and artists joinging 
civil servants from city offices and the ministries of railways 
forestry and foreign affairs 
another procession was led by the beijing independent workers 
union a new group challenging government bans on nonofficial 
trade unions 
the movement no longer belongs to the students a machine 
factory worker said intellectuals and workers must unite and 
carry it on 
the marchers cheered on by 100000 onlookers proceeded around 
the square which has been occupied since may 13 by tens of 
thousands of students who are pressing for reforms including a 
free press and an end to official corruption 
chinas leaders were believed to be holding secret meetings to 
decide how to cope with the governments worst crisis since the 
196676 cultural revolution 
western diplomats said today that zhao a relative liberal had 
been strongly criticized in recent meetings of the partys ruling 
politburo and was in danger of being publicly humiliated 
the diplomats said li is following the lead of deng who had 
urged putting beijing under martial law and having troops crush the 
student movement 
a foreign ministry spokeswoman li jinhua insisted at a weekly 
briefing that there had been no leadership changes 
she said that because of the new arrangements of his work 
president yang shangkun was postponing a latin american visit next 
week she refused to answer questions about the politburo or 
whether zhao was under fire 
because of his decision to try to end the upheaval premier li 
has been the target of demonstrations that have spread to shanghai 
and dozens of other chinese cities in the past few days 
early today an effigy of him lying in a tomb was hung in front 
of the great hall of the people next to tiananmen square some 
passersby laughed and clapped 
the military has not tried to push through the barricades set up 
by city residents and some senior officers have called for an end 
to martial law 
but it appeared wednesday the army was closing ranks behind li 
with the general staff publishing a letter strongly supporting lis 
hardline position the letter was republished today in all major 
newspapers 
however chinese sources said the struggle between zhao and li 
was not yet over the struggle is very intense one source 
said we dont even believe our own rumors now 
one of the top candidates to move into the void if zhao and li 
fall national peoples congress chairman wan li arrived in 
shanghai late wednesday after cutting short a visit to the united 
states

the soviet union has retracted a threat to 
retain some nuclear missiles banned under a 1987 treaty us 
officials said today 
the ss23 missiles which have a range of about 315 miles or 
just above the treaty threshold were outlawed along with all us 
and soviet missiles with a range of 312 to 3125 miles 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said may 13 while 
on a trip to west germany that destruction of the ss23s might be 
stopped if the north atlantic treaty organization deployed new 
lance missiles 
the usbuilt lances have a range of about 75 miles but after 
the treaty was signed the united states and britain launched a 
campaign within nato to more than triple the missiles range to 
just below 300 miles 
west germany and several smaller countries in the western 
alliance registered objections to the modernization program and 
called for ussoviet negotiations over the lances and other 
shortrange nuclear arms 
the issue will be aired in brussels next monday and tuesday when 
president bush and the leaders of the 15 other nato countries hold 
a summit meeting in the belgian capital 
shevardnadzes statement was interpreted as an attempt to 
pressure the allies to postpone plans for making the lance missiles 
more potent the united states and britain also are resisting west 
german chancellor helmut kohls call for negotiations as 
potentially harmful to natos strategy 
the state department on may 15 denounced shevardnadzes 
statement as outlandish and bush last sunday said the threat 
made clear that soviet new thinking has not yet totally 
overcome the old 
however the day before bush spoke pravda the soviet communist 
party newspaper had published an interview with shevardnadze in 
which he said no one in the ussr intends to upset the inf 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty 
on monday the soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady 
gerasimov gave similar assurances in moscow 
the soviets called our attention to the retractions a us 
official said today the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said it had been considered unlikely in any event that 
the soviets would not fulfill their obligation under the treaty to 
destroy the missiles 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler today welcomed 
shevardnadzes statement and said gerasimovs remarks had also been 
noted 
during negotiations that preceded the 1987 treaty the soviets 
resisted including the ss23s but relented they have 200 missiles 
in the category as well as trainers all are supposed to be 
destroyed by dec 1

the soviet union is increasing its sales of 
enriched uranium to us nuclear power plants and is not playing 
fairly in the global market for this product a senior energy 
department official said thursday 
henson moore the deputy energy secretary said the soviets now 
have 8 percent of the us market for enriched uranium which is 
used as a fuel for civilian nuclear power plants 
there are plans for them to move even more aggressively to 
take even more of our market right out from under our noses 
moore told a capitol news conference at which house members 
unveiled a bill aimed at revitalizing us sales of enriched 
uranium 
moore did not elaborate on his assertion that the soviets were 
unfairly marketing their uranium enrichment services except to 
say it was difficult to determine their production costs because of 
the closed nature of that society 
moore said the bush administration had helped draft the house 
bill which would tranform the energy departments enriched uranium 
operations into a government corporation the united states has no 
privately run uranium enrichment business 
rep marilyn lloyd dtenn a lead sponsor of the bill said 
the us share of the world market for sales of enriched uranium 
has plunged from 100 percent 15 years ago to less than 50 percent 
today she said the decline would continue unless the operation 
were made a government corporation 
rep bob mcewen rohio a cosponsor of the legislation said 
taking the energy department out of the business would give it more 
flexibility since its executives would not have to get 
congressional approval before making key moves 
the department runs its enrichment operations at plants in 
portsmouth ohio and paducah ky these plants increase or 
enrich uranium235 atoms beyond their natural concentration 
for use in nuclear reactors including those used to power navy 
ships and submarines

the internal revenue service says farmers may 
be liable for capitalgains taxes if part of a farmers home 
administration loan is forgiven 
the ruling which was made public in a letter to members of 
congress is in line with the law affecting other taxpayers which 
holds generally that forgiveness of a debt creates taxable income 
we are disappointed but its not something that was totally 
unexpected jim sinner an aide to rep byron dorgan dnd 
said thursday what the irs is saying basically is that where 
there is forgiveness of debt there is going to be an income tax 
consequence 
the irs letter resulted from a farmers home administration query 
asking hypothetically how a restructuring of an fmha loan would be 
treated for tax purposes 
the one outstanding issue that was resolved in this irs 
explanation is treatment of sharedappreciation agreements and 
other contractual arrangements that continue beyond the act of 
restructuring sinner said 
under shared appreciation a farmer agrees that as a condition 
of having a loan restructured any increase in value of the 
property securing the loan over the next 10 years will be shared 
with the government 
under the ruling sinner said current taxes would not be 
affected by such an agreement but once the property increases in 
value and the sharing arrangement is triggered there would be a 
new calculation that takes into account the higher value 
sinner said dorgan will introduce a bill that would forgive 
taxes due on restructured loans in cases in which the farmer is 
operating on a margin so thin that he cannot afford the taxes

regulators and consumer advocates urged 
congress thursday to open the way for quicker refunds to customers 
of more than 19 billion in excess taxes collected by utilities 
the plain unvarnished fact is that investorowned utilities 
have collected from ratepayers and are using for their own 
purposes 19 billion more about 223 per household than they 
owe the us government for income taxes susan c stone a 
member of the illinois commerce commission told a news conference 
the taxes were collected in advance from customers in 
anticipation that the utilities would have to pay federal taxes at 
a maximum corporate rate of 46 percent however that rate was 
reduced to 34 percent in 1986 and power companies and other 
utilities were allowed to keep the excess taxes for as long as 30 
years before refunding them 
a bill introduced by reps bob matsui dcalif and byron 
dorgan dnd would authorize state utility commissioners to 
require that the taxes be refunded to customers over a period of at 
least three years starting in 1991 
never before in my 11 years in congress has an issue been as 
crystal clear as this one matsui said its a matter of right 
vs wrong good public policy vs bad special interests ethics vs 
greed 
utilities insist they need to retain the taxes for much longer 
to finance improvement of plant and equipment 
this money is not just sitting in a bank account said bill 
mccloskey spokesman for bellsouth it is being used to improve 
the telephone network for the benefit of our customers which is 
the exact intention of the tax code 
david m barasch president of the national association of state 
utility consumer advocates said there is no disagreement that 
utilities will never have to pay the excess taxes over to the 
government the only issue he said is how soon the money should 
be returned to taxpayers 
the timing of refunds is a consumer protection and utility 
health issue that is within the expertise of regulators rather 
than tax collectors said peter bradford chairman of the new 
york state public service commission the bill he added 
corrects this glaring flaw by providing a minimum refund period 
that is more in line with economic reality

two vietnam veterans from akron ohio said 
thursday they will continue to organize group tours of vietnam for 
fellow veterans in defiance of a treasury department order 
the american civil liberties union said it will defend the two 
men if they are prosecuted 
the treasury department sent a letter in february to donald 
mills and john myers of the akron chapter of vietnam veterans of 
america them to immediately terminate performing any activities 
involving travel tours to vietnam 
the departments letter said such activities are prohibited 
under foreign assets control regulations and are punishable by a 
fine of up to 50000 imprisonment for up to 10 years or both 
the regulations were issued in march 1988 in accordance with 
economic embargo laws affecting vietnam cambodia and north korea 
under the trading with the enemy act they do not prevent a veteran 
from traveling on his or her own 
mills and myers have conducted the trips twice yearly since 
1984 the seventh and most recent one was in february 
the next trip is scheduled for november and will involve 21 or 
22 veterans paying 2700 for three weeks in vietnam including 
travel accomodations and meals mills said 
he said it would be too difficult and costly for most veterans 
to make the trip individually 
mills said he began the trips after going to vietnam on a 
permitted mission for the veterans organization in 1984 and 
finding that many veterans wanted to return to the scene of the war 
i feel that going back to vietnam is very beneficial to 
them he said every other veteran in history has been able to 
return back to the battlefield that they served in there is no 
reason why we as veterans cant do the same thing 
susan r brenda legislative analyst with the washington office 
of the aclu joined mills and myers at a news conference and said 
the treasury department is simply without authority to reach 
directly into the first amendmentprotected activities of americans 
in the united states and prevent them from organizating towards the 
perfectly legal end of travel to vietnam 
in 1977 the treasury department issued regulations exempting 
travel transactions from the embargo and authorizing individuals 
to spend funds incident to travel the march 1988 regulation 
amended this by prohibiting americans in the united states from 
arranging or promoting such travel 
we believe that an attempt to prosecute vietnam veterans for 
traveling back to vietnam in an effort to learn about present day 
vietnam and heal old deep wounds would be a grave mistake ms

however we will assist these veterans in their legal defense 
a telephone call was placed to roger bolton assistant secretary

ms brenda said the aclu is supporting a bill sponsored by rep 
howard berman dcalif that would prohibit the embargo laws from

a dispute over shortrange nuclear 
weapons policy may not be resolved before president bush and the 
other nato leaders begin a summit next week the alliances chief 
executive said thursday 
ive still some hope but im not sure secretarygeneral 
manfred woerner said in an interview at north atlantic treaty 
organization headquarters 
failure to settle the disagreement which is primarily between 
the united states and germany would be a rather unfortunate 
situation but it would not be a crisis or a catastrophe he said 
this alliance has lived with differences of opinion all 
through its very successful lifetime and if this question is not 
solved today it will be solved tomorrow the former west german 
defense minister declared 
woerner added however that he would like the allies to 
overcome their divisions and avoid the impression of being split 
in an important matter 
bush and leaders of the 15 other members will meet on monday and 
tuesday for a 40th anniversary summit it will be the first nato 
meeting for the president since his inauguration in january 
nato officials had hoped the meeting would be an example of 
unity at a time when mikhail s gorbachevs promises of reductions 
in the soviet military personel arms and defense spending have 
captured public imagination in western europe 
the argument over shortrange or battlefield nuclear weapons 
has dominated preparations for the meeting at which the leaders 
are expected to plot nato strategy 
at issue is a west german demand for early negotiations with the 
sovietled warsaw pact on reducing such arms in europe most of 
natos shortrange nuclear missiles are based in west germany and 
would be used there in case of war 
the united states and britain arguing that attention should 
center on new talks in vienna on reducing conventional weapons 
they also feel negotiations on tactical nuclear arms would lead 
inevitably to removal of all such weapons from europe 
woerner said any solution to the dispute must connect the 
beginning of shortrange nuclear negotiations to a specific stage 
of the conventional arms discussions 
as examples he mentioned the end of the first phase during 
which bargaining positions are introduced and when results of the 
talks are implemented 
alliance officials have been seeking acceptable language on the 
future role of shortrange nuclear weapons for the comprehensive 
concept a blueprint for nato planning on arms control and force 
structures the document is virtually complete except for a 
paragraph on the contentious issue 
some diplomats have said they would like the document released 
probably monday even if teh dispute is not settled woerner would 
not speculate on whether that would be done 
he also said the summits main task will be to map the future 
nato agenda including a political message on relations with 
the changing soviet bloc 
bush and the others will consider how we want to cooperate 
with the soviet union and eastern europe and make use of the 
existing opportunities woerner said let me make it very clear 
that this summit is not a missile summit

teachers today tentatively agreed to end a 
strike that has crippled the nations secondlargest school 
district for 11 days 
a 10hour bargaining session ended about 1 am with an 
agreement on a threeyear package that would give teachers an 8 
percent raise per year and more say in shaping the curriculum in 
the 594000student district 
teachers could be back in class by friday if they approve the 
pact said union president wayne johnson a ratification vote was 
set for this afternoon 
the union board of directors met to consider the agreement this 
afternoon as ballots and copies of the offer were printed up for 
the ratification vote 
the union representing 22000 of the districts 32000 teachers 
walked out may 15 in the citys first such strike in 19 years 
about half the students stayed away from school opting for the 
beach shopping malls or home many who did attend school were 
treated to games cartoons and filmstrips because there werent 
enough substitute teachers 
teachers had been earning between 23440 and 43319 a year 
depending on experience and education the new pact would raise 
those salaries in the first year of the contract to 25316 and 
46594 
at the start of the walkout the district was offering a 215 
percent raise over three years the union had sought a twoyear 21 
percent increase 
the contract would also give teachers a bigger hand in deciding 
what goes on in their classrooms with the district no longer 
enjoying veto power on curriculum decisions 
i hope this signals a new era of working together of 
cooperation rather than confrontation said school board 
president roberta weintraub 
but johnson said the union made compromises that could become 
stumbling blocks including an agreement that teachers would work 
extra hours to recover pay docked during the dispute he would not 
say whether he would recommend ratification 
johnson said the strike probably would leave no hard feelings 
between the union and district but that it would take a 
considerable amount of time to heal those wounds between 
striking teachers and those who crossed picket lines 
on wednesday a striking teacher was booked on assault charges 
for allegedly throwing a rock at a substitute sheriffs deputies 
said the rock missed the teachers car and struck a 12yearold 
girl outside a junior high school 
negotiations had collapsed sunday with both sides accusing each 
other of lying and bargaining in bad faith 
but johnson said the impasse was broken following meetings 
tuesday in sacramento in which officials from both sides spoke to 
los angelesarea lawmakers the meetings laid groundwork for 
wednesdays negotiating session 
most classes wind up june 23 but some schools operate 
yearround

the cost of being represented in court 
by a public defender in cass county is for one defendant 18 
snakes 
robert haggerty who breeds snakes for a living told cass 
circuit court judge donald leicht that he could not afford an 
attorney to defend him against drug charges 
so leicht reviewed haggertys assets this week and ordered his 
stock of snakes sold at auction to pay legal costs 
haggerty 36 estimated the value of his pets at 3800 said 
court reporter debbie frey 
the snakes were taken from haggertys apartment april 18 after 
police arrested him on charges of possession of cocaine and 
marijuana 
authorities had been called to the apartment by a neighbor 
complaining of a burning smell the odor turned out to be caused by 
a makeshift electrical system through which haggerty allegedly was 
using the neighbors electricity investigators said 
when authorities entered the apartment they saw a sign on a 
bedroom door that read dont enter this room a rattlesnake is 
out of the cage 
the officers called in animal control officer dan baker 
there was no power in the house said baker and im 
walking around with a flashlight trying to find a snake 
they found 18 reptiles all in aquariums one other aquarium 
housed 23 live mice the snakes intended meals 
the snakes included three poisonous rattlesnakes an arizona 
mountain king an albino black rattler and three boa constrictors 
one of the boas is pregnant and could give birth to about 50 
offspring each worth 80 to 100 baker said 
authorities have been calling zoos around the midwest but have 
yet to receive an offer for the snakes

chinese students at us universities 
are setting up news hot lines and raising thousands of dollars to 
provide communications equipment for the protesting students in 
beijing 
the 27000 raised so far by students in the boston area 
includes 15000 from a fundraiser tuesday night the money for 
such equipment as fax machines and copiers and material will have 
to be taken clandestinely into china by students returning home or 
by other friends of the movement organizers said wednesday 
dubbed the may 4th foundation after one of chinas first 
prodemocracy student uprisings in 1919 the fund has drawn chiefly 
from the roughly 600 chinese students studying in the boston area 
it has also attracted contributions from students from hong kong 
and taiwan as well as a few from americans 
the demonstration that has dominated beijing and other chinese 
cities for weeks will be remembered probably as the greatest 
popular movement in china said pei minxin 31 a thirdyear 
graduate student in government at harvard 
it has accomplished a great deal so far it has aroused the 
political consciousness of the chinese people and also provided the 
chinese people both at home and abroad with a sense of hope he 
said 
in addition to raising money chinese students in the boston 
area have set up an informal information center 
the walker center for ecumenical exchange an international 
study center in newton mass has donated its phones to chinese 
students who man them in 24hour shifts monitoring news reports 
receiving information from china and passing on news not available 
on the streets of beijing 
wednesday was the massachusetts institute of technologys turn 
to man the phones chinese students from harvard boston 
university northeastern brandeis and tufts university also have 
participated 
center director gordon schultz said he is terrified of the 
phone bill he will receive but hopes to raise funds from americans 
to support the effort 
the center also is providing computers and fax machines for the 
students 
at the university of california at berkeley and stanford 
university students are compiling news reports and using fax 
machines to transmit the information back to china under the name 
operation newslift 
li hao 24 a student at mit said the fundraising effort is 
designed to sustain the demonstration but he said the protest 
movement has already achieved its primary goal 
china is no longer what it was before hao said the 
chinese government can no longer do whatever they want 
the students studying here say they wish they could participate 
in the china demonstrations and are acting to contribute something 
but they are anxious for their friends 
most of my classmates are in tiananmen square so im 
concerned very much said hao a graduate of beijing university

the west german dispute with the bush 
administration over shortrange nuclear weapons has ended decades 
of german acquiescence over nato strategic policy and severely 
strained relations with the united states 
the west german call for prompt superpower talks on the missiles 
came just weeks before the upcoming north atlantic treaty 
organization summit in brussels nato officials had hoped the may 
2930 meeting would be a show of unity as the alliance celebrates 
its 40th anniversary 
but the unprecedented west german drive for the talks put nato 
on notice that this frontline nation intends to take a greater 
role in determining future alliance policy 
several european nato allies expressed support for the west 
german position on the talks deepening the rift 
the age of west german timidity is ending peter danylow a 
domestic and foreign policy expert with the bonnbased foreign 
affairs institute told the associated press 
chancellor helmut kohls coalition government is also resisting 
a joint usbritish effort to replace natos aging shortrange 
missile arsenal in the 1990s with modernized rockets of more than 
triple the current range 
the issue is sensitive because most of the weapons are deployed 
in west germany and would fall on german soil in the event of war 
the united states and britain oppose early talks on the weapons 
saying the warsaw pacts superiority in conventional forces must 
first be reduced 
kohl and his foreign minister hansdietrich genscher maintain 
that their nations legitimate interests must be taken seriously 
genscher architect of the current west german missile policy 
has long advocated that the west take every opportunity to improve 
relations with the soviet bloc 
but west german resolve on the missile matter is new 
the current missile dispute has made it clear that west 
germany must be seriously reckoned with on alliance decisions that 
directly affect german interests said heinz timmermann a 
researcher at the colognebased institute for eastern european and 
international studies 
timmermann said bush administration sluggishness in formulating 
a foreign policy response to soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs disarmament initiatives fueled bonns decision to press 
for the talks 
i think many in the government perceived that washington was 
not moving quickly enough and letting moscow steal the tune 
timmermann told the ap 
the recent west german decision to press for talks on the 
weapons came while the popularity of kohls coalition government 
was at an alltime low with west germans becoming increasingly 
impatient for the west to respond to gorbachevs initiatives 
the political pressure to take the missile stand at the time 
was certainly enormous timmermann said 
after kohls christian democrats were buffeted by serious 
regional election setbacks the chancellor reshuffled his cabinet 
and engineered a coalition consensus on the rockets issue in line 
with the growing public mood for progress in arms control efforts 
public opinion polls indicate bonns current course is supported 
by the majority of west germans who have become increasingly 
defiant about heavy defense burdens put on the country by the 
alliance 
michael stuermer a former kohl speechwriter and historian now 
with the foundation for political science in ebenhausen said a 
1987 superpower agreement to eliminate intermediaterange nuclear 
missiles fueled public demands for new disarmament initiatives 
the chain of arms escalation was broken stuermer said 
referring to the treaty 
the new dynamic in eastwest relations has triggered an urgent 
domestic policy issue at home stuermer said 
shortly before the start of the summit west germany britain 
and the united states were still divided over the most contentious 
issue when to start eastwest talks on reducing the shortrange 
missiles 
in washington on thursday state department spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler said discussions are continuing there remains a gap to 
be bridged she added that we have received a response today 
from west germany and the gap remains 
earlier in an editorial the respected die zeit weekly 
newspaper had admonished the west german government not to back 
down too soon 
better an anniversary fight than a weak compromise said the 
independent die zeit

constable gary witherspoon wants ellis 
county to pay him 30000 per year to do what he now does for 40 
per month 
county officials claim witherspoon and constable bruce 
hollabaugh have virtually no duties 
witherspoon and hollabaugh have sued accusing county 
commissioners of acting arbitrarily and unjustly by paying them 
only 25 a month plus a 15 monthly car allowance they want to be 
paid what constables in comparable counties earn as much as 
30000 
county judge penelope redington says the county does not give 
the constables so much as a pencil or a desk let alone a car a 
staff and the other usual trappings that would indicate they carry 
out official county business 
state law requires each county with more than 30000 people to 
have at least four justice of the peace precincts each with a 
constable and a justice ellis countys population is estimated at 
75000 
a constable like a sheriff is an elected official and a 
certified peace officer authorized to carry a gun make arrests and 
serve courtrelated documents 
in urban counties constables usually serve notices of lawsuits 
and other papers associated with the civil court system they also 
serve as bailiffs in the justice of the peace courts while the 
sheriff runs the jail and carries out law enforcement functions 
each of dallas countys eight constables is paid 49152 
annually plus a monthly car allowance of 350 
but in rural counties the sheriff is responsible for all jail 
and courtrelated activities and the constables office is largely 
symbolic 
ellis county sheriff john gage who took office in january and 
is paid 34140 annually said his deputies serve virtually all 
warrants and civil court papers 
witherspoon said he also serves civil court papers mostly those 
coming from other counties he declined to say how many papers he 
serves monthly 
a hearing is set for june 5 on hollabaughs suit no date has 
been set for witherspoons suit

the government launched a campaign thursday to 
encourage parents to talk more explicitly with their children about 
sex saying their failure to do so has contributed to the aids 
epidemic 
the parent who does not take time today to teach his or her 
child properly could end up later in a hospital room watching that 
child die said dr james o mason assistant secretary of health 
and human services 
mason unveiled a 15 million campaign involving a new brochure 
and television advertisements designed to spur family dialogues 
about sex and aids 
he said the program is taking a somewhat different tack 
stressing the advantages of sexual abstinence by youth than 
earlier aidsprevention campaigns which put more emphasis on the 
use of condoms as a safe sex option 
kids and condoms dont work awfully well said mason 
weve done studies and we find that they act on impulse they 
dont plan ahead so a condom is there 
i think the fact that parents have not sat down and talked 
with their children is the reason that were today reaping the 
harvest of hiv human immunodeficiency virus which causes aids 
said mason were trying to bring the nations parents into this 
picture and let them make the contribution that they are capable 
of making 
mason also blamed the lack of frank parental guidance for 
contributing to other sexually transmitted diseases and the 1 
million teenage pregnancies annually 
aids is an incurable disease that already has been diagnosed in 
almost 95000 americans and caused more than 53000 deaths 
officials say that about 18000 of the current cases involve people 
aged 19 to 29 years since a person may be infected with hiv for up 
to 10 years before aids symptoms appear hhs scientists believe 
many of the current cases result from teenage infections 
health and human services secretary louis w sullivan and walter 
r dowdle acting director for the centers for disease control 
concurred with mason at the news conference that parental guidance 
is essential if the epidemic is to be brought under control 
adults have to send a clear message to the young people they 
care about said sullvan no matter how young you are you can 
become infected with hiv if you have sex with an infected person 
the officials showed a series of short television commericials 
that will be offered to the tv networks as public service 
announcements the ads themselves encourage parents to initiate 
frank discussions with their children about aids and give a 
tollfree telephone number 1800342aids that adults can call 
to obtain copies of the more detailed brochure 
the campaign calls for sexual abstinence by youth monogamy for 
adults and the use of condoms for those who insist on having 
multiple partners 
the new guide includes special sections written for children of 
various age levels the public health service is printing 500000 
copies in english and another 100000 in spanish the television 
ads are being produced in both languages 
the guides section for high school students advises dont do 
drugs of any kind and offers five reasons for delaying sex 
including avoiding unwanted pregnancy 
the guide for teens however goes on to say that when you 
decide you are ready to become sexually active do so only with one 
uninfected partner in a mutually faithful longterm relationship 
such as marriage 
finally if you have sexual intercourse outside of a mutually 
faithful longterm relationship with an uninfected partner use a 
condom but remember that condoms are not foolproof and may break 
however use a latex condom whenever having any type of sexual 
intercourse

top business economists predicted on thursday 
that the us economy is headed for a soft landing in which 
growth slows enough to tame inflation and interest rates without 
toppling the country into a recession this year 
the latest survey from the national association of business 
economists projects that the gross national product the broadest 
measure of the economys health will grow 28 percent this year 
and 18 percent in 1990 
that would represent a significant retreat from the robust 39 
percent pace of growth last year 
jay n woodworth president of the association and an economist 
with bankers trust co said the report supports the case for a 
soft landing to take place in the economy a period of fairly 
slow gnp growth slow enough so that it takes the pressure off the 
inflation rate it takes the pressure off interest rates 
the anticipated slowdown also is likely to be accompanied by an 
increase in unemployment and slower growth in industrial 
production the forecasters said 
while signs of a slowdown already have been emerging the 
quarterly surveys by the business group have been becoming 
gradually more optimistic about prospects for avoiding a recession 
fortythree percent of the 54 analysts surveyed earlier this 
month predicted the next recession would occur in 1990 while 20 
percent expect the nations record peacetime expansion to end this 
year 
that projection is slightly more optimistic than the groups 
last quarterly forecast issued in february when 75 percent of 
those surveyed expected a recession this year or next last 
november 88 percent expected a recession by the end of next year 
recent government reports measuring the economys performance so 
far this year indicate that growth is slowing in response to a 
federal reserve campaign to restrain economic growth and curb 
inflation by pushing up interest rates 
the government reported thursday that the gnp grew at a 43 
percent annual rate in the first three months of 1989 much slower 
than previously thought the pace was a lackluster 18 percent when 
a statistical bounceback from last years drought is excluded 
but woodworth said the new gnp report was good news because 
it reflects a downward revision in the accumulation of inventories 
held by businesses 
if the groups economists were polled again now they might be 
just a trace more optimistic than they were when surveyed earlier 
this month woodworth said 
despite their growing optimism the forecasters acknowledged 
that the real trick from an economic policy perspective is 
preventing the forces that are responsible for a major slowdown 
from degenerating into a fullblown recession 
soft landings have often appeared possible but inflation 
has invariably worsened the groups report said with the 
runup in prices government policy has been forced to squeeze 
still harder and soft landings are lost in the process 
the economists forecast that in conjunction with slower growth 
the unemployment rate will creep up from a 15year low of 5 percent 
in march averaging 54 percent for all of 1989 and 58 percent in 
1990 
inflation which advanced at a sharp 66 percent pace in the 
first four months of 1989 was expected to peak at the middle of 
the year and then moderate price increases were forecast to 
average 53 percent this year and 47 percent in 1990 up from 44 
percent in 1988 
both long and shortterm interest rates were expected to 
continue dropping with current declines in rates already 
outstripping the groups projections 
the yield on threemonth treasury bills was projected to drop 
from 88 percent in march to 73 percent in december 1990 yields 
on 30year treasury bonds were estimated at 87 percent in december 
1990 down from 92 percent this march 
progress on the countrys twin trade and budget deficits 
meanwhile was expected to continue over the next two years but at 
a slower pace 
the median trade deficit forecast was 112 billion for 1989 and 
100 billion in 1990 down from 1198 billion in 1988 the budget 
deficit which reached 1551 billion in 1988 was pegged at 160 
billion for 1989 and 140 billion in 1990

dust plumes spewed out by volcanoes long 
thought to cool the climate may well have little weather effect a 
new study contends 
previous suggestions of large cooling during the first few 
months after volcanic events appear to be unwarranted 
researchers clifford f mass and david a portman say in the june 
issue of the journal of climate published by the american 
meteorological society 
volcanic eruptions have often been blamed for cooling of the 
climate in the past based on the theory that the dust they inject 
into the atmosphere would block sunlight and reduce the normal 
warming of the land and sea surface 
indeed the cold weather in 1816 known to historians as the 
year without a summer has been widely blamed on a series of 
volcanic eruptions that occurred in various parts of the world 
between 1812 and 1815 
in their study portman and mass said prior analyses may have 
been confused by temperature changes that involve a periodic 
warming and cooling of sea and air temperatures a pattern known as 
the el ninosouthern oscillation 
after subtracting those effects from the historical records 
they concluded that only the largest eruptions are suggested in 
the climatic record and that a modest cooling is observed for one 
to two years after these large events 
they defined modest cooling as about onetenth to twotenths of 
a degree celsius in average temperatures that would amount to 02 
to 04 degrees fahrenheit 
the authors found little hint of any effect on air pressure or 
rain or snowfall 
considering that eruptions throwing dust into the air should 
interfere with radiation from the sun they asked themselves why 
is the volcanic effect on surface climate so small 
the answer they concluded amounts to an altered form of the 
greenhouse effect the currently widely discussed threatened 
heating of the planet 
volcanic stratospheric aerosols can drastically reduce the 
direct solar beam they concluded an effect which should lower 
the temperature by reducing the warming from the sun 
but at the same time these chemicals and dust also block 
infrared rediation from the ground and ocean what would normally be 
radiated back into space cooling the planet 
because volcanic clouds often shade only a small portion of the 
surface and have only a negligible net effect on the radiation 
balance they result in little measurable climate change concluded 
mass of the university of washington in seattle and portman of 
atmospheric and environmental research inc cambridge mass 
records which seem to indicate cooling following eruptions could 
reflect ordinary variations in climate they conclude in fact a 
more detailed analysis of the records indicates that in some cases 
gradual cooling reported following eruptions had actually begun 
beforehand 
as for 1816 mass and portman conclude that it was an unusually 
cold summer in north america and parts of europe but the degree of 
cooling was not unprecedented the cold year could have resulted 
from consistent wind patterns bringing arctic air south they said 
the greenhouse effect which has become a source of concern in 
recent years results from an accumulation of carbon dioxide and 
other gases in the atmosphere largely a result of burning fossil 
fuels and other industrial processes 
like volcanic dust these gases trap the earths heat 
preventing it from radiating out into space and cooling the planet 
but unlike the volcanic dust the greenhouse gases do not balance 
things by blocking incoming sunlight

a white expoliceman who said he 
believes blacks are animals was sentenced to hang thursday for 
killing seven blacks and an indian man in two shooting sprees he 
hoped would provoke a race war 
the killings by barend strydom were committed in an unfeeling 
and coldblooded manner that i have never before experienced or 
heard of said justice louis harms mass murder or racial 
murder will not be tolerated by this court 
in one of south africas most dramatic trials relatives of the 
black victims and white extremists supportive of strydom crowded 
into pretoria supreme court for two weeks to hear testimony about 
the 23yearold defendants racist beliefs 
harms convicted strydom last week of killing seven people and 
wounding 15 blacks in a rampage on the sidewalks of downtown 
pretoria on nov 15 a week earlier strydom said he killed a black 
woman and wounded another at a squatter camp using them as target 
practice to determine whether he was ready for a largerscale 
massacre 
after the sentencing the whitesupremacist boerestaat party 
said it will campaign for clemency for strydom boerestaat leader 
robert von tonder said strydom is a sensitive afrikaner patriot 
standing impassively for an hour while harms read his ruling 
strydom gulped a glass of water when the sentence was pronounced 
then was escorted to a police van and driven to death row at 
pretoria central prison 
police vehicles blockaded streets around the courthouse and 
scores of officers stood guard they used dogs to control several 
hundred people mostly black who waited in a park across the road 
harms gave strydom eight death sentences and 30 years in prison 
for 16 counts of attempted murder no execution date was set and 
defense lawyers said they would appeal 
harms thanked simon mkonduleli a black taxi driver who grabbed 
strydoms pistol to halt the nov 15 massacre mkonduleli said he 
has been harassed and threatened by white men several times since 
the rampage including after thursdays court session 
strydom had acknowledged that he smiled as he shot his victims 
telling the court last week im a friendly person 
he testified he fired the first shots in a war of freedom 
for whites threatened by the countrys black majority 
i do not think blacks are human beings he said 
stateappointed psychiatrists concluded strydom was sane 
his father also a former policeman testified he taught his 
children that blacks were animals 
defense lawyer johan engelbrecht argued strydom viewed the 
killings as selfdefense saying he fears blacks fears that the 
government will yield and that whites will be sold out 
harms drew a parallel between strydoms case and that of robert 
mcbride a mixedrace guerrilla of the african national congress 
who argued he was taught to hate whites mcbride is on death row 
after being sentenced for planting a bomb that killed three women 
in 1986 
the death sentence is mandatory for murder in south africa 
unless the judge determines there are mitigating circumstances

the us economy grew at a moderate 43 
percent annual rate in the first three months of the year the 
government said thursday in a report which economists and the bush 
administration saw as a sign the countrys record peacetime 
expansion is continuing 
the commerce departments revision in the firstquarter gross 
national product to well below its original 55 percent estimate 
came amid worries that federal reserve efforts to stem inflation 
could move the economy into a recession 
but commerce secretary robert mosbacher said the report shows 
that fed policy over the past year appears to be succeeding in 
steering the economy to a more moderate but sustainable growth 
path 
michael boskin chairman of president bushs council of economic 
advisers said the report made him confident the economy will 
continue its growth inflation will be contained and the economy 
will remain solid 
some private economists said flatly that the report rules out 
any recession for at least the remainder of the year a survey of 
economic forecasting experts conducted before the latest gnp 
release also discounted any recession in 1989 
not only is there no sign of a recession in sight said 
allen sinai of the boston co but the question now is whether we 
will get a significant rebound in the second and third quarters 
michael evans of evans economics inc agreed that the last 
chance for a recession this year has just evaporated 
the economy is in amazingly good shape he said there 
seems to be no signs of a serious slowdown 
both the 43 percent growth rate and the earlier 55 percent 
estimate included the statistical effects of last years drought on 
the farm sector removing that sector means the nonfarm economy 
grew at only a 18 percent rate compared with the earlier estimate 
of 35 percent this is the slowest quarterly nonfarm gnp advance 
in more than two years 
not all economists were encouraged by the report however 
lawrence a hunter deputy chief economist for the us chamber of 
commerce said the nonfarm growth rate means we have fallen 
through the feds target for a soft landing and would be heading 
directly to a hard fall 
the new report did not change the earlier 5 percent annual 
inflation rate in the first quarter compared with 42 percent in 
the previous octoberdecember period 
as the commerce department announced the latest gnp the 
national association of business economists released a survey 
predicting a dramatic slowing in economic growth but also without 
any recession during the remainder of the year 
nabe president jay n woodworth said in releasing the report 
that the 54 forecasting experts in the survey might be just a 
trace more optimistic today than they had said earlier this month 
when the survey was conducted 
but the nabe survey suggested a moderate increase in 
unemployment and higher inflation due to rising food and energy 
prices 
in yet another economic report the national association of 
realtors said rising mortgage rates continued their toll on 
existing home sales sales fell by 11 percent in april the fourth 
consecutive monthly decline to a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
of 336 million units the report said it was the slowest annual 
rate since february 1988 
fed efforts to stem inflation by tightening credit have been 
blamed for rising interest rates 
the commerce department also reported thursday that 
firstquarter aftertax corporate profits were off 17 percent 
the decline follows a 32 percent increase in 1988s last quarter 
and was the biggest drop since a 25 percent fall in the fourth 
quarter of 1987 
in its gnp report commerce said the economy grew 431 billion 
to 4077 trillion in the first quarter when adjusted for 
inflation without the inflation adjustment growth increased 106 
billion to 5105 trillion the first quarter the gnp topped the 
5 trillion mark 
a slower inventory buildup together with a faster export pace 
than previously believed was most responsible for the downward 
revision in the firstquarter gnp 
the smaller inventory list was seen as a plus for the economy 
because large buildups without accompanying sales often mean job 
layoffs 
and the increased exports combined with fewer imports resulted 
in a betterthanexpected decline in the trade deficit the report 
said the deficit narrowed at an annual rate of 176 billion the 
first improvement since the spring of 1988 exports in the 
januarymarch quarter rose at a 153 percent annual rate compared 
with a 09 percent increase in imports

house majority leader tom foley offers a 
striking contrast to speaker jim wright and that is a big reason 
why so many congressmen republicans as well as democrats hope 
he soon will become speaker 
as house members scattered thursday at the start of a long 
memorial day weekend there was a clear sense that the ethics 
controversy surrounding wright was overwhelming him and forcing him 
to step down 
i know of no plans for the speaker to retire said foley who 
flew to seattle to attend the funeral of former democratic sen 
warren magnuson the speaker as far as i know intends to go 
forward now with the regular process of the evidentiary hearing 
that was something democrats clearly hoped was not the case in 
fact some seemed eager to have foley take over the leadership of 
the house 
there is near unanimity of support for tom foley said rep 
pat williams dmont 
during the period of turmoil and tension in the house why is 
the washington congressman considered such a shooin to be the next 
speaker 
part of the answer is tradition as majority leader foley 
occupies the post that customarily is the steppingstone to the 
speakership wright moved up after serving as majority leader and 
so did his predecessor thomas p oneil as did his predecessor 
carl albert and his john mccormack 
but that logic of succession doesnt fully account for foleys 
unique standing during this troubled time 
its more a case of perception 
the speakers problems have translated into institutional 
problems for all of us said rep charles stenholm dtexas 
the institution is getting a black eye 
during the little more than two years he has been speaker 
wright proved a strong leader who gave the democrats the initiative 
on many issues during the last two years of ronald reagans 
presidency though he was not given high marks for his more recent 
handling of the unsuccessful push for a congressional pay raise 
i think when the history of the house in this era is written 
jim wrights tenure in the 100th congress will be compared with 
henry clay in the 12th congress or joe cannon in the 58th or sam 
rayburn in the 76th said rep chester atkins dmass a member 
of the house ethics committee 
but were not here to stand in judgment of jim wrights 
speakership went on atkins 
what the committee was examining was the speakers book deal 
his oil well deal his partnership with texas businessman george 
mallick 
what finally confronted the democrats were the allegations 
accurate or not that wright profited from his power at the 
pinnacle of the house 
ironically as the case against wright began to unfold early in 
the 101st congress the senate was flourishing under new 
leadership that of sen george mitchell dmaine 
if anyone in the house leadership could be compared to mitchell 
it was foley both men come across as downtoearth types who 
adhere to principles without being unduly partisan both are 
effective on television 
some of the highest praise for foley comes from republicans 
tom foley is just a very able capable individual said rep 
bob michel of illinois the house republican leader hes well 
liked on our side and hes also recognized as a very formidable 
opponent one who will state the case well and he is eminently 
fair 
hes a man of total integrity said senate gop leader bob 
dole of kansas 
one rainy october evening in seattle during the 1988 
presidential campaign provided an example of foleys selfeffacing 
style 
democratic candidate michael dukakis had just addressed a huge 
downtown crowd the speech over the campaign retinue raced through 
the downpour to the waiting vehicles 
a rainsoaked foley a large grayhaired bear of a man 
approached a dukakis staff car and was waived away 
as he started walking away reporters in the next car invited 
him to join them he did and laughing off the incident regaled 
them with stories of similar occasions 
already one of the nations most powerful politicians he 
demonstrated an ability to avoid taking himself too seriously

more and more americans know people can get aids 
from sexual intercourse with an infected person but not from casual 
contact with an aids victim a federal study released thursday 
shows 
the study based on about 3500 interviews a month from august 
1987 to august 1988 and conducted by the federal centers for 
disease controls national center for health statistics indicates 
that americans think they know more about aids than before and that 
they may be right 
but it may be years before the improvement shows up in a drop in 
reported new aids cases because some people can be infected with 
the aids virus for 10 years before symptoms appear federal 
researchers say 
the cdcs morbidity and mortality weekly report released 
thursday in atlanta said the overall gain in knowledge about 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome coincides with a national 
public awareness campaign 
it said the effect of one element of the campaign the mailing 
of an aids fact brochure to most american households in may and 
june of 1988 is being analyzed 
the report said the percentage of parents who discussed aids 
with their children remained constant at about 60 percent but that 
those reporting their children had aids education in schools was up 
from 36 percent to 59 percent 
the adults correctly answering it was definitely true that 
aids was an infectious disease caused by a virus rose from 44

president bush departs friday for a nato 
summit clouded by discord over nuclear strategy and concerns that 
moscow is driving a wedge in the western alliance with politically 
appealing disarmament offers 
on the eve of his departure bush received a new message from 
west german chancellor helmut kohl who is pushing for superpower 
talks to slash arsenals of shortrange nuclear missiles the issue 
that separates washington and bonn however presidential spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said the two sides were still at an impasse 
the consultations are about where they have been fitzwater 
said the issue is still an open one but it has not been 
resolved at this point 
he said time is running out on chances to resolve the 
quarrel before the leaders of the 16 nato countries meet in 
brussels on monday playing down the dispute fitzwater said we 
dont believe it will overwhelm or dominate the summit and it 
should not and will not be allowed to 
bushs trip his first to europe as president will take him 
to italy belgium west germany and england 
the journey is an important step for bush as he tries to 
establish himself as a world statesman and attempts to counter the 
success of soviet president mikhail gorbachev in projecting himself 
as a peacemaker with a series of promises to cut military spending 
arms and troops 
coming on the heels of ronald reagans series of five summits 
with gorbachev and the signing of a major ussoviet arms 
agreement bush is between a rock and a hard place said 
university of virginia political scientist larry sabato 
the rock is reagan and the hard place is gorbachev between 
the two giants hes coming out on the short end sabato said 
norm ornstein a political analyst at the american enterprise 
institute said european leaders all know bush and regard him with 
a sense of predictability and familiarity 
at the same time i dont think theres a sense of awe or a 
feeling weve got somebody in there who can keep up with 
gorbachev ornstein said 
he said bush needs to show that the leader of the free world 
is going to be just that 
before arriving in brussels bush will spend two nights in rome 
he will meet with italian leaders have an audience with the pope 
john paul ii and deliver an address previewing the nato summit the 
speech site is the american cemetery at nettuno the burial site of 
7850 men and 12 women who were killed in world war ii 
he will go to bonn after the summit for a twoday visit and then 
stop in london before flying to his vacation home in kennebunkport 
maine on june 2 
the nato summit was intended an as anniversary party toasting 
the strength of the western alliance and celebrating 40 years of 
peace in europe 
however the missile dispute with bonn has marred the atmosphere 
the rift was triggered by germanys demand for the united states 
and the soviet union to begin negotiations soon to reduce and 
possibly eliminate nuclear missiles on both sides with a range of 
up to 300 miles 
bush has opposed opening talks saying he would not go along 
with any steps leading to the elimination of nuclear weapons in 
europe in a gesture of compromise bush agreed last week to the 
principle of negotiations but under conditions that would put off 
any talks for years 
the west german government also is resisting a joint 
usbritish effort to more than triple the range of lance missiles 
to just below 300 miles all us and soviet missiles with ranges 
between 300 and 3000 miles were banned under a 1987 treaty 
the usbuilt lances now can hit targets from about 75 miles 
most of the 88 launchers carrying about 700 singlewarhead 
missiles are based in west germany 
its nothing new that a new president faces a test from 
moscow said burton pines senior vice president and director of 
research at the heritage foundation the first test of bush is 
not coming from moscow its bonn which is testing the new 
president 
its going to be a crossroads summit said william j 
taylor vice president for politicalmilitary affairs at the center 
for strategic and international studies 
our forecast for at least the last six years has been that by 
the late 1980s nato cohesion would be under serious challenge and 
there was a reasonable probability of the disintegration of nato 
he said 
bush rejects that kind of scenario i have a feeling that 
theres been a lot of smoke and that well have a good summit he 
said recently 
this alliance is not going to fall apart it is going to stay 
together and be strong bush said 
however the administration readily acknowledges there are major 
strains on the alliance 
the glue that has kept it together and has overcome all the 
divisive issues that always plague the alliance its always in 
trouble the glue has been the threat of the soviet union said 
a senior administration official one of the top advisers to bush 
well you know maybe thats not true anymore and theres a 
growing perception that hey there isnt going to be an attack in 
europe so we need to infuse the alliance with some new unifier 
added the official speaking on condition of anonymity

house speaker jim wright is considering 
resigning his post next week regardless of whether the house 
ethics committee first agrees to drop charges against him 
congressional leadership sources said today 
the sources speaking on the condition of anonymity said the 
speaker had not yet made a firm decision to abdicate but the 
democratic leadership was making arrangements for a resignation 
speech before the house next wednesday 
i think he just wants his day in the well of the house said 
one source close to the arrangements 
democrats have begun speaking of a succession in which rep 
thomas foley dwash the majority leader would move up to 
speaker as early as next week 
there is near unanimity of support for tom foley rep pat 
williams of montana said wednesday foley himself said today he 
knew of no plans for the speaker to retire 
wright dtexas remained secluded in his office today but he 
issued a statement indicating he was no longer counting on success 
from the efforts of his lawyers on wednesday to convince the house 
ethics committee to drop charges of financial improprieties against 
him in exchange for his stepping down sources said 
there is no deal now there will be no deal in the future 
the statement said 
wrights statement was issued as republicans toughened their 
stance that any plea bargain would be improper 
publicly wright insisted he would press ahead with his 
defense against the charges in the house ethics committee 
at the same time he dispatched his lawyers to explore 
alternatives to what could be weeks of trying to change the minds 
of committee members who brought the charges against him 
the speakers lawyers meeting wednesday with attorneys for the 
ethics committee offered his post in exchange for dismissal of the 
charge that he accepted improper gratuities from a developer 
friend according to sources familiar with the talks 
some sources said wright might subsequently resign from the 
house where he has served since 1955 
one alleged gift was a job for betty wright the committees 
outside counsel says she did little if any work for her salary 
wright says she did and has vowed in sometimes dramatic statements 
to protect her honor 
the talks on wednesday included suggestions that the 
conflictofinterest charges could be narrowed to eliminate the 
years when mrs wrights job was involved 
rep john myers of indiana ranking republican on the ethics 
committee said today he would not be party to such a deal 
rep newt gingrich rga the house minority whip said of 
wright as long as hes a member of the house i think our 
position is that it is totally inappropriate for the ethics 
committee to engage in plea bargaining 
on the other hand if the speaker thinks the ethics commitee 
has a sound case he has every right to collapse gingrich said on 
abctvs good morning america program 
house gop campaign officials have said wrights ethics will make 
a juicy campaign issue for them in 1990 
meyers said ethics committee members wednesday afternoon 
authorized outside counsel richard phelan to hold discussions but 
not negotiations with wrights lawyers phelan met with rep 
robert torricelli dnj a member of the speakers defense team 
house republican leader bob michel rill who was keeping tabs 
on the talks told reporters that quite frankly the integrity 
of the ethics committee might very well be undermined if they were 
to succumb to that kind of entreaty from the speaker 
he said if he were up against the kind of charges facing the 
speaker he would have resigned already 
still one congressman familiar with the talks speaking on 
condition of anonymity said a majority of the ethics committee 
favored some sort of negotiated settlement the committee is made 
up of six democrats and six republicans 
publicly wright himself refused to concede his 35year 
legislative career might be nearing an end or even that democrats 
were losing confidence in him i dont feel that at all he 
told reporters 
the speakers search for a political solution to his dilemma 
came only one day after his lawyers made a dramatic televised pitch 
to the committee that the charges should be dropped for legal 
reasons 
the committee recessed wednesday until june 1 without making a 
decision on the legal arguments 
committee chairman julian dixon met privately with majority 
leader foley to discuss the situation neither man would discuss 
their talks publicly 
some said they expected a deal would be made before that next 
committee meeting 
what i know is that negotiations are taking place that deal 
with resolving this issue very soon rep bill richardson said 
wednesday richardson said he expected an arrangement to be made 
within a day or two 
while dropping all or part of the conflictofinterest charge 
was discussed sources said the committee was not receptive to any 
arrangement that would clear wright of charges that he evaded house 
limits on outside income through bulk sales of his book 
reflections of a public man 
wright was something other than a public man on wednesday 
he skipped a democratic party event staged to highlight their 
fight with president bush over the minimum wage bill which bush 
has promised to veto 
he spoke briefly with reporters who threw out questions as he 
entered a meeting with his texas house colleagues and spent most 
of the day in a series of meetings with his supporters and his 
leadership team before leaving the capitol early in the evening 
he issued a statement insisting on his innocence 
i very firmly believe that my position is right i hope and 
trust that the committee will consider the matter on its merits and 
dismiss the charges 
i eagerly await the time and opportunity when my side of this 
whole question may be heard clearly by my colleagues and the 
american people to this end i shall press ahead 
richardson reflecting the weariness of house democrats agreed 
with the speaker that it was important that his case be made 
but he added that was done yesterday referring to tuesdays 
televised hearing 
while foley was considered a sure thing for the speakers job 
rep richard gephardt of missouri did not dampen speculation that 
he might seek the speakers job or perhaps foleys current 
position the democratic whip tony coelho of california caucus 
chairman bill gray of pennsylvania deputy whip david bonior of 
michigan and rep lee hamilton of indiana were also mentioned as 
seeking to move up in the leadership

rising mortgage rates slowed the sale of 
existing homes in april to the worst pace in 14 months the 
national association of realtors reported thursday 
the trade group said sales of singlefamily homes declined last 
month to an annual rate of 336 million units down 11 percent 
from march off 43 percent from a year ago and the lowest figure 
since february of 1988 
higher interest rates have stymied efforts of renters to 
become homeowners nar president ira gribin said 
tradeup buyers in large part are driving the market now 
he added firsttime buyers with no equity and a tight budget 
continue to be left behind particularly in highcost areas 
the federal home loan mortgage corp said that interest on 
fixedrate conventional mortgages ranged between 1107 percent and 
1103 percent in april up more than 05 percent from a year ago 
the interestrate increase results from federal reserve efforts to 
stem inflation by tightening credit 
the nar said a 75 percent 
drop in existing home sales in the west which had recently 
experienced heavy resale activity led the april decline and there 
was flat activity in the south which previously had the highest 
sales volume 
sales in the west declined to an annual pace of 62000 homes in 
the south the rate remained 127 million units yearly 
sales actually rose 7 percent in the northeast to an annual 
rate of 610000 units and were up 23 percent in the midwest to a 
rate of 890000 units 
the national median price for existing singlefamily homes was 
93500 in april the nar said that was up 63 percent from a year 
ago and 1500 higher than in march analysts said this primarily 
reflected the higher costs of moveup homes

percent in the first quarter of 1989 the biggest decline in more

economy the commerce department said aftertax profits dipped to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1716 billion during the first 
quarter down from 1745 billion during the previous threemonth 
period 
decreases in profits were widespread within manufacturing 
industries while earnings in trade transportation public 
utilities and other nonmanufacturing industries also fell 
aftertax profits had risen 147 percent during 1988 reflecting 
the robust economic growth that occurred last year but earnings 
are widely expected to fade this year as the economy slows and 
labor costs rise 
economist allen sinai of the boston co called it a standard 
latestage business expansion phenomenon for earnings to fall as 
an economic recovery ages 
the firstquarter falloff in aftertax profits was the biggest 
drop since a 25 decline registered in the fourth quarter of 1987 
the momentum of growth in profits in the first quarter showed 
significant signs of beginning to fade and that will be the story 
on profits for the next year sinai predicted 
among the details in the profits report 
beforetax profits edged down 02 percent last quarter to a 
seasonally adjusted annual level of 3199 billion after rising 
21 percent during the previous threemonth period

some house democrats worried thursday that 
ethics questions raised about house majority whip tony coelho could 
make him an inviting political target if the feisty californian 
becomes majority leader 
but the former democratic congressional campaign chairman who 
dispensed money for many members successful reelection campaigns 
still enjoys significant backing among colleagues 
coelho could face a challenge from rep richard gephardt dmo 
who was an unsuccessful presidential candidate last year one 
democratic member who spoke only on condition he not be named 
said theres a good chance gephardt would run for majority 
leader 
democrats said in interviews their problems could be compounded 
if speaker jim wright resigned because of ethics charges and 
after rep thomas foley dwash moved from majority leader to 
speaker coelho was sitting in the no 2 spot with an ethics cloud 
over his head 
some colleagues suggested that a way out would be to quickly 
elect foley as speaker and allow several weeks to pass before 
deciding on other leadership positions 
we must make sure nobody who is in a replacement mode has any 
impediments that cause problems said rep dan glickman dkan 
if we have a secondary ethics problem it could be very 
catastrophic for our party in the house were on somewhat shaky 
footing now and need to reestablish our stability 
glickman said a coolingoff period after election of foley would 
allow races to develop and time to gauge reaction to coelhos 
ethics problems 
news stories have detailed and coelho has confirmed that a 
california savings and loan official purchased a 100000 
highyield junk bond for the lawmaker in 1986 after coelho found 
himself unable to finance the purchase himself 
a month later the bank official sold the bond to coelho for the 
initial offering price which saved the lawmaker about 4000 
compared with the market price at the time 
house rules prohibit members from accepting gifts from anyone 
with a direct interest in legislation coelho said he did not 
violate house rules and asked the ethics committee to review the 
transaction 
on thursday the los angeles times reported the justice 
department is conducting a preliminary criminal investigation of 
whether coelho received favors from drexel burnham lambert inc 
the firm that issued the junk bond 
coelho said in a statement i am confident the story is 
inaccurate and i so advised the los angeles times which chose to 
go ahead with the story anyway in washingtons current atmosphere 
such stories based on rumors or leaks are perhaps inevitable but 
no less regrettable 
the associated press reported earlier this week that coelho 
owned an interest in a dairy management company at the same time he 
was pushing legislation to help maintain the profitability of some 
dairy farms 
rep pat williams dmont said house democrats should not 
immediately fill the majority leader whip and caucus chairman 
positions should wright resign but added the coelho camp wants the 
incumbents to quickly move up the ladder 
williams said some members believe coelho has put a lid on the 
junk bond matter but when informed of the story on a possible 
criminal probe said any continuation of the investigation 
would of course have a negative effect on his chances 
coelhos strongest support appeared to come from his own 
california democratic delegation whose chairman rep don edwards 
said we just think tony has been the best whip in the history of 
the house and deserves to be majority leader 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo said of coelhos ethics 
questions people want answers but i dont see a panic about it 
at all 
and rep george brown dcalif a coelho supporter said that 
members will take into consideration the public reaction to the 
situation

a gasoline pipeline exploded today 
in a cauldron of flames that engulfed the neighborhood where a 
runaway train demolished a row of houses may 12 at least two 
people were killed 24 injured and seven homes destroyed officials 
said 
flames reached 500 feet into the sky and black and gray smoke 
towered thousands of feet following the blast at 811 am in the 
14inch line 
my windows started shattering the houses were on fire the 
cars one man ran out he was in flames said june chung whose 
home in rialto overlooks the scene about a mile away 
its just a terrible scene it looks like a bomb went off over 
duffy street said city attorney james penman 
the explosion occurred in a pipeline buried six feet below the 
site of the train wreck earlier this month the pipeline had been 
inspected and reopened by calnev pipeline co several days ago 
after the city was assured it was safe penman said 
obviously in this case the experts were wrong calnev has 
got a lot of explaining to do said penman 
at least two people died in the blast city fire spokesman paul 
allaire said 
sgt dan hernandez said seven homes were destroyed by flames 
across the street from where the freight train destroyed six houses 
and damaged five earlier this month twenty homes threatened by the 
inferno were evacuated penman said 
seven people who were burned one seriously were at san 
bernardino county medical center said eleanor borkowski a 
spokeswoman five more people were being treated for minor injuries 
at st bernardines hospital and 12 others at san bernardino 
community hospital officials said 
theres some people we are looking for said mayor evlyn 
wilcox as she comforted a weeping woman who said she lost 
everything 
on may 12 a 69car southern pacific freight train jumped the 
tracks on a mountain pass at 90 mph killing two crew members and 
two boys in a home 
part of the pipeline which carries fuel from los angelesarea 
refineries to las vegas was exposed after the train wreck when 
crews had to move earth to salvage the freight cars the 
neighborhood was evacuated for several days for fear the line had 
been weakened 
railroad spokesman jerry pera said it is possible the 
catapulting freight cars damaged the underground pipeline 
national transportation safety board investigators who probed 
the train wreck were returning obviously we have to see if 
theres a connection said ntsb spokesman alan pollock in 
washington 
im out of my house again we dont have nowhere to go said 
laruth littlejohn 51 who lives a block from the explosion site 
and was evacuated during the train wreck 
mrs littlejohn said she saw one girl burned and helped carry 
away a woman hurt when her house exploded 
i was astounded said kevin chafee describing the explosion 
and fire from six miles away theres a huge tower of black smoke 
going up over san bernardino i thought downtown san bernardino was 
on fire 
a witness steve blade reporting from 200 feet away said six 
homes were engulfed in flames moments after the explosion 
it wasnt immediately known how much gas was burning said jed 
robinson calnev general manager 
the flow of gas was shut off when an automatic alarm signaled a 
drop in pressure robinson said the fact the fire has continued 
to burn makes us think there might be a leak in the check valve 
he said 
the line carries gasoline diesel and jet fuel from a tank farm 
in colton which is several miles from the blaze site to southern 
nevada

actor lee majors says he didnt hesitate to 
invest more than 3 million in two oilpatch businesses because he 
considered their president and chief operating officer a friend 
televisions former six million dollar man now claims he 
lost 15 million because of his investments in two enid 
oildrillingrig companies operated by vaughn good 
he appeared in court wednesday to testify on a lawsuit that he 
and investor ray davis filed against good and his wife laura the 
two men are seeking 3 million in actual damages plus unspecified 
punitive damages 
majors said good was a father figure to him after they met in 
1971 when good was his host during the grand national quail hunt 
which each year draws celebrities to enid 
the actor testified that he was flattered in july 1980 when good 
asked him to invest in one of his companies without contacting his 
business manager majors said he signed a personal line of credit 
of 600000 to get a 30 percent share in the company two months 
later majors said he invested 26 million in a second drilling 
company operated by good 
he testified that he would not have invested in either company 
had he known of a number of questionable financial transactions 
that he claimed eventually cost him 15 million 
in their lawsuit majors and davis claim that the goods used 
company money to pay personal bills and buy expensive oilfield 
equipment only to turn around and sell it and keep the profit for 
themselves 
the goods attorney stephen jones claimed the legal dispute 
stems from sour grapes partly because of the drop in oil 
prices after the 1982 oil bust the trial on the lawsuit continued

laws intended to make polluters pay for oil 
spills and toxic wastes are not working because the government 
hasnt been willing to spend enough to assess the damages a house 
subcommittee was told thursday 
state environmental prosecutors from new york and massachusetts 
said interior department regulations coupled with the lack of 
funds for assessment studies actually obstruct more than enhance 
efforts to make polluters pay 
the rules so severely limited the damages collectable that to 
our knowledge no state trustees have used the regulations in the 
almost three years since their promulgation said new york 
assistant attorney general gordon johnson 
the only winners have been the polluters johnson told the 
house merchant marine committees subcommittee on fisheries and 
wildlife conservation 
administration officials conceded a dearth of damage 
assessments both for the hundreds of major oil spills that have 
occurred since the 1972 clean water act was passed and for 
corporate liabilities under the 1980 superfund law to clean up 
thousands of toxic waste sites 
officials for the interior and commerce departments as well as 
the environmental protection agency all said separate funds for 
assessments were opposed by the reagan administration and that 
none of their agencies have money for them 
but they said the bush administration is now rethinking that 
view in light of the valdez tanker spill in alaska in march and 
noted that president bush is seeking money to assess damages as 
part of his proposal to establish a 500 million oil spill cleanup 
fund 
louise wise deputy director of the epas office of marine and 
estuarine protection said her agency had opposed setting money 
aside for assements out of fears it would deplete actual cleanup 
funds provided for toxic waste dumps under the superfund law 
we are talking to our administrator about reconsidering our 
position she said 
rep gerry studds dmass the subcomittees chairman 
encouraged that effort saying of bush the president has enough 
middle names without adding maybe to the list 
because there is no money for the damage assessments studds 
said compensation cannot be obtained 
erik olson of the national wildlife federation noted that the 
government had to rely on the exxon corp to put up 15 million for 
the assessment of damages from its valez oil tanker spill march 24 
in prince william sound 
this lack of money can lead to a subtle blackmail problem 
he said because exxon is paying it likely will argue that 
it should have a lot to say about how the damages are calculated

mikhail s gorbachev was overwhelmingly elected 
president today by the countrys new congress winning more than 95 
percent of the vote 
the sole candidate gorbachev received 2123 of the 2210 votes 
cast yuri a osipyan chairman of the commission that counted the 
ballots reported during nationally televised proceedings of 
congress of peoples deputies eightyseven deputies voted against 
the communist party chief osipyan said 
gorbachev who was unanimously elected president on oct 1 by 
the supreme soviet replacing andrei a gromyko secured 956 
percent of the votes cast by deputies in todays secret balloting 
osipyan said 
earlier today the congress the first competitively elected 
soviet parliament nominated gorbachev as the sole candidate after 
rejecting demands he first report on his accomplishments and 
failures 
maverick communist boris n yeltsin withdrew his nomination bid 
a littleknown leningrad deputy alexander obolensky offered 
himself as an alternative to gorbachev but twothirds of the 
2250member congress of peoples deputies rejected him 
obolensky who is not a member of the ruling communist party 
said he knew he had little chance of winning the nomination but 
wanted to set a precedent of an alternative 
yeltsin whose antietablishment campaign garnered 90 percent of 
the vote in an election in moscow took himself out of the running 
saying simply im withdrawing myself he said as a member of 
the partys central committtee he was bound by the committees 
decision to support gorbachevs election 
before the vote human rights activist andrei d sakharov said 
he would not take part in the secret balloting for the presidency 
we cant let these elections just be a formality the 1975 
nobel peace prize winner said sakharov was one of four deputies 
who abstained when the congress voted to place gorbachevs name on 
the ballot 
noone voted against gorbachevs nomination 
estonian activist marju lauristen offered gorbachev her vote on 
condition he answer some tough questions first for instance she 
wanted to know who in the ruling politburo knew of plans to use 
troops to break up a proindependence demonstration in soviet 
georgia and how soon gorbachev learned of the plans 
nineteen people died in the ensuing clash 
others demanded explanations of privileges enjoyed by soviet 
leaders and of a decree banning statements that discredit 
authorities 
as the inaugural session opened the congress immediately 
plunged into spirited debate over its agenda and powers the lack 
of parliamentary experience showed 
gorbachev led the proceedings sitting behind two microphones 
with a giant statue of vladimir i lenin at his back he 
arbitrarily called for votes on some procedural issues while 
ignoring others only a few deputies objected 
at one point the soviet president took the microphone for 20 
minutes and in one of his most impassioned political speeches 
pledged not to abuse power if reelected 
gorbachev vowed to pursue the line of democracy until the very 
end so that what has happened in this country will never again be 
repeated his remark was an obvious reference to past 
authoritarian soviet regimes 
one of the first deputies to take the floor was sakharov who 
was banished from moscow until december 1986 for human rights 
activities 
sakharov praised gorbachev for changing the face of soviet 
society and said he should be reelected president but demanded 
that gorbachev first give congress an account of the mistakes and 
achievements of his reform efforts 
sakharov also argued for changing the agenda of the congress 
chosen in the countrys first contested elections in seven decades 
he said the congress should act as the nations principal 
lawmaking body that is supposed to be the job of a new 542member 
supreme soviet being elected by the congress 
gorbachev cut sakharov off after five minutes set a time limit 
on subsequent speakers and moved to end debate on the agenda 
the agenda was adopted by a wide margin however in a country 
where legislative proceedings traditionally have been by unanimous 
consent there were 379 votes against the agenda and nine 
abstentions 
not all parliamentarians were happy with the morning session 
its not at all democratic said egidijus klumbys a member 
of the lithuanian reform group sajudis klumbys said he doubted 
other sessions would be different 
at least 80 percent of the deputies are communist party members 
but a small band of reformers assured the congress will differ 
sharply from the docile rubberstamp assemblies of the past 
formally the congress has little power other than to elect the 
president and members of the supreme soviet and review the 
presidents appointments for top government posts 
twothirds of the delegates were chosen by voters and the rest 
were chosen by official organizations

a soviet neurosurgeon who was gassed during an 
ethnic protest in soviet georgia has helped american doctors 
identify the poison as a world war iera field gas named 
chloropicrin the doctors said thursday 
he gave us an exquisitely detailed account of the symptoms 
said dr barry h rumack director of the rocky mountain poison 
center in denver they couldnt have gassed a better guy at 
least in terms of getting complete neurological findings 
soviet officials have said red army troops used two chemical 
agents the tear gasses cn and cs to disperse a crowd of 8000 to 
10000 people demonstrating april 9 in the georgian capital of 
tbilisi 
but because more than 350 people were hospitalized and at least 
20 died during and after the protest georgian officials have 
charged for weeks that something more potent than tear gas must 
have been sprayed 
rumack was one of three medical experts sent by physicians for 
human rights a 1300member group based in the boston area to 
investigate those charges the american doctors spent may 1722 in 
tbilisi at the invitation of georgian health officials and andrei 
sakharov the soviet physicist and human rights activist 
after interviewing dozens of doctors and patients examining 
videotapes of the protest and analyzing some gas canisters 
allegedly used by soviet troops the american team is 99 percent 
certain that chloropicrin was used rumack said 
the chemical also known as nitrochloroform was first used on 
humans on a world war i battlefield in 1916 it causes potentially 
lethal chest irritation and pulmonary edema or fluid leakage into 
the lungs 
until the 1960s chloropicrin occasionally was used for civilian 
crowd control in the united states but is now banned because of 
its toxicity it can be used legally in the united states only by 
licensed applicators as a fumigant against insects rumack said 
the strongest evidence that it was used in georgia he said was 
the patients symptoms including burns in their mouths and 
throats and a molecular analysis of a gas canister by a highly 
accurate technique known as gas chromatographymass spectroscopy 
rumack said he watched as soviet laboratory technicians analyzed 
the canister and came up with results consistent with 
chloropicrin 
he also said some of the symptoms such as dry mouths and 
dilated pupils could not have resulted from tear gas or most nerve 
gasses but would be expected with chloropicrin 
citing the possibility of retribution against the neurosurgeon 
who helped describe his own and other peoples symptoms rumack 
declined to name him 
besides rumack who is a professor of toxicology at the 
university of colorado medical center in denver the members of the 
american delegation were dr jennifer leaning chief of emergency 
services for the harvard community health plan in cambridge and 
dr ruth a barron a psychiatrist at mclean hospital in belmont 
rumack said he believed four demonstrators died instantly when 
they were sprayed directly in the face with an aerosol propellant 
used with tear gas he said neither tear gas nor chloropicrin alone 
would account for such rapid deaths 
how many later died from chloropicrin is uncertain because 
autopsy reports were impounded by the military and more than a 
month has gone by he said

a test firing of a modified space 
shuttle rocket engine aborted automatically after 25 seconds when 
instruments detected excessive vibration the marshall space flight 
center said thursday 
but spokesman jim sahli said wednesdays test scheduled to last 
2 minutes was not a failure because it can still provide 
information about the engines operation 
sahli said engineers attempting thursday to trace the cause of 
the abort which could be related to a test detonation of an 
explosive within the engines combustion chamger 
the cutoff occurred a fraction of a second after engineers were 
to detonate explosives inside the combustion chamber of the engine 
which was mounted in a 300foothigh rocket test stand 
john mccarty head of marshalls propulsion laboratory said the 
explosives and a second device that may not have detonated were 
placed inside the engine to show how engine systems perform during 
unexpected occurrences 
steve richards mccartys technical assistant said the 
explosive device could have caused systems to sense changes and 
shut down the engine 
sahli said the test was part of a fiveyear program aimed at 
developing a better more efficient and better performing 
engine he said it was a technology development test and not a 
flight test 
wednesdays test firing was the seventh since the national 
aeronautics and space administration began the program at marshall 
in october 
sahli said the test would be rescheduled in about three weeks 
marshall is responsible for shuttle main engines booster 
rockets and external fuel tanks

the lessening of military tension between east 
and west could lead to lower defense budgets and free resources to 
preserve the environment said a study released thursday by the 
worldwatch institute 
i think that everyone realizes that one era is coming to a 
close worldwatch director lester r brown told a news 
conference no one is quite sure what the next era will look 
like 
the study national security the economic and environmental 
dimensions forecast that as the superpowers decrease military 
spending they will devote more resources to solving ecological 
problems of their own and of poorer countries 
both the united states and the soviet union have pursued an 
elusive military superiority at the cost of their international 
ecomomic standing said michael renner author of the report 
but he said if eiher side claims to have won the cold war 
it is surely a pyrrhic victory 
japan is probably the real winner of the arms race renner 
told the news conference at worldwatch offices worldwatch is a 
nonprofit research group 
already nations have devoted increasing attention if not 
resources to environmental protection forming environmental 
alliances to combat such problems as pollution of the baltic sea 
and the depletion of the ozone layer the report said 
environmental alliances are already beginning to cut across 
military alliances said renner noting that the nations 
cooperating to curb pollution in baltic sea include members of the 
north atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact denmark 
east and west germany poland the soviet union 
in another instance cited by renner west germany agreed to 
pay for sulphur dioxide scrubbers on czechoslovakian power plants 
in an effort to reduce the air pollution wafting across the border 
and will probably assist east germany in the same manner 
many of the environmental alliances involve 
governmenttogovernment contacts said the report but citizens 
groups are already beginning to cooperate 
environmental links across the eastwest divide on the 
grassroots level are still in their infancy but environmental 
groups such as friends of the earth and greenpeace among others 
are busy building contacts with the nascent eastern european and 
soviet environmental movements it said 
brown acknowledged that many soviet citizen environmental groups 
were also active in national front movements that seek greater 
independence for the soviet baltic republics of lithuanian latvia 
and estonia 
western groups said brown were avoiding contact with the 
baltic movements to avoid infringing on what the kremlin might view 
as a national security risk 
another worldwatch report issued earlier this year action at 
the grassroots said that in the soviet union and eastern 
europe where officially sanctioned local organizations are 
numerous but largely controlled by state and party hierarchies the 
political openness of this decade has brought the genesis often at 
great risk to the founders of independent citizens groups

former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone denied 
involvement in the recruit bribery scandal in longawaited 
testimony before parliament on thursday but he admitted he 
received donations from the company 
i am totally innocent nakasone said under oath before the 
budget committee of the house of representatives i regret such a 
scandal occurred when i was the head of the government i deeply 
apologize for causing distrust in politics 
but nakasone acknowledged publicly for the first time that since 
1982 he received a total of 322000 in political donations from 
recruit co an information and publishing conglomerate 
people nationwide turned on their television sets for nakasones 
testimony which was broadcast live 
officials of the governing liberal democratic party said the 
three hours of questioning proved nakasones innocence in the 
financial scandal which occurred during his 198287 administration 
but opposition leaders said he dodged crucial questions they 
demanded he testify a second time before parliaments upper house 
meanwhile members of the governing partys executive council 
were to meet friday in their continuing search for a successor to 
prime minister noboru takeshita 
the liberal democrats have been unable to replace takeshita who 
announced last month he would resign in face of widespread distrust 
in the party and government after the recruit scandal most senior 
party officials have admitted receiving money or stock from the 
company 
nakasone said contributions he received from recruit were 
reported to the government as stipulated by law but suggested that 
some donations may have been divided among several support groups 
to remain below the minimum reporting amount 
nakasone 70 is the first politician called to testify under 
oath in parliament in the scandal he had refused earlier 
opposition demands to testify leading to a threemonth opposition 
boycott of debate on the fiscal 1989 budget 
i refused to testify earlier because i have never done 
anything wrong nakasone said thursday 
after the session a visibly relieved nakasone told reporters 
facts are facts they always prevail 
but opposition leaders said they doubted his testimony 
i regret his testimony was filled with lies said tsuruo 
yamaguchi secretarygeneral of the japan socialist party the 
largest opposition group it amounted to a defense of his seat in 
parliament 
in the scandal recruit sold highly discounted unlisted stock 
to about 160 influential people including 17 politicians or their 
aides many recipients sold the stock after it was publicly listed 
and rose quickly in value reaping large profits 
eleven of the politicians were members of nakasones cabinet 
and opposition parties have charged that he was at the center of 
the scandal 
nakasone has acknowledged that three aides bought a total of 
29000 recruit shares the largest amount of any politician he 
testified thursday that they made a profit of about 450000 and 
used the money for entertaining political associates 
in his testimony nakasone also denied any involvement in the 
resale of two usmade cray supercomputers to recruit by japans 
semiprivate telecommunications giant nippon telegraph and 
telephone 
former company chairman hisashi shinto is among 16 bureaucrats 
businessmen and politicians arrested or charged in the scandal 
prosecutors have said he assigned preferential treatment to recruit 
in return for stock 
prosecutors on monday lodged bribery charges against two 
politicians nakasones chief cabinet secretary and the former 
secretary general of the opposition komeito 
the scandal has caused the resignation of three cabinet members 
in addition to prime minister takeshita and led to a sharp drop in 
public support for the liberal democrats

consumer food prices are rising faster than 
predicted a few months ago and may gain an average of 5 percent to 
7 percent over the entire year the agriculture department said 
thursday 
that would compare with a 1988 average gain of 41 percent and 
would be the sharpest 12month increase since 1981 when retail 
food prices rose 79 percent 
consumer demand will pull up food prices in 1989 the 
departments economic research service said while growth in the 
general economy is slowing growth in real disposable personal 
income is still likely to be 2 percent to 3 percent this year 
after rising 29 percent last year 
the report said that the labor departments consumer price index 
for food increased at an annual rate of 86 percent in the first 
three months of 1989 well above the rate expected last fall 
additional upward adjustments are likely for the rest of this 
year based primarily on the strength of consumer demand and the 
impact of higher petroleum prices the report said 
much of the sharp rise in the first quarter was blamed on cold 
weather in mexico florida and california which cut supplies of 
fresh vegetables retail prices which had been expected to decline 
during the quarter rose an average of 57 percent 
other price increases in the first quarter resulted from 
lingering effects of last summers drought 
processed vegetable prices continued to rise because of 
smaller supplies of canned sweet corn green peas snap beans and 
dry beans all victims of the drought the report said smaller 
supplies of canned vegetables forced frozen vegetable prices higher 
as well 
another firstquarter factor was retail egg prices up 295 
percent from a year earlier production was cut back because of 
high droughtrelated feed costs the report said 
food price increases are expected to be more moderate in the 
remainder of 1989 prices for meats poultry and fish will remain 
reasonably stable for the rest of the year the report said egg 
prices are expected to fluctuate but should remain well above 
yearearlier levels 
retail prices of fresh vegetables following a normal pattern 
will decline this spring and summer from the first quarters high 
marks and then ease up again in the fourth quarter 
prices of cereals and bakery products fats and oils and other 
prepared foods were forecast to rise at a modest but steady 1 
percent to 3 percent annual rate per quarter through 1989

heather j gradison resigned thursday as 
chairman of the interstate commerce commission rather than face a 
tough reconfirmation fight in the senate 
the white house and i have concluded it was not in our 
interest to fight the senate commerce committee said mrs 
gradison a member of the commission since 1982 and its chairman 
since december 1985 she said she will leave when a successor is 
confirmed 
the white house did not respond immediately to a request for 
comment 
sen j james exon dneb a member of the committee said mrs 
gradison wife of rep willis d gradison jr rohio probably 
would not have been reconfirmed 
most of the democrats and most of the republicans on the 
commerce committee had the feeling that she had not during her term 
followed the intent of the railroad deregulation act said exon 
reached in nebraska asked whether he would have voted for 
reconfirmation exon said i would not 
the senator called mrs gradison a dedicated and talented 
woman but said we felt that the president could select someone 
that would be maybe a little more in tune with what the congress 
intended when they wrote that bill 
the act that freed railroads from government regulation had 
provisions to protect the socalled captive shipper the coal 
mine operator or wheat farmer who had only one a single source of 
transportation available 
under the act the icc could hold hearings and bring pressure to 
bear on railroads if it felt they were out of line exon said we 
felt that under mrs gradison the icc did not perform as was 
intended 
mrs gradison 36 had spent eight years in the railroad 
industry with the southern railway system when she was appointed as 
one of the five icc commissioners by president reagan she is a 
strong supporter of transportation deregulation and said the icc 
in a news release she firmly maintained throughout her tenure 
that reduced governmental regulation encourages the development of 
new and better ways for transportation companies to serve the 
public 
exon said however that she did little to help the captive 
shipper 
one of the classic cases in this regard was the public power 
company in nebraska being charged exorbitant rates by the 
railroad he said the company took it to the icc which said it 
couldnt or wouldnt do anything about it 
the case went to court he said and the railroad was ordered to 
pay back a substantial amount of money 
mrs gradison announced her resignation to about 100 coworkers 
in a brief and emotional speech 
i think its time to move on said mrs gradison 
her voice breaking mrs gradison said i think the time has 
come to take advantage of the free market opportunity i have talked 
about and find some for myself

physicians and lawmakers urged congress 
thursday to overhaul the system of medicare payments that enables a 
doctor in new york to receive 7500 for triplebypass surgery 
while a kansas colleague only gets 3500 
the current system is completely out of whack rep wayne 
owens dutah told the house energy and commerce subcommittee on 
health and the environment 
witnesses who testified before the house panel agreed that the 
medicare physician reimbursement system discriminates against 
doctors practicing in rural areas but they disagreed over ways to 
eliminate the inequities 
the focus of the debate were the recommendations of physician 
payment review commission an independent agency that monitors 
medicare payments and has proposed replacing the present system 
with a medicare fee schedule 
under the plan developed by the harvard school of public health 
and outlined by commission chairman dr philip r lee the fee 
would be based on a physicians work including his time effort and 
the skills needed to perform the task and the overhead cost of a 
practice a physicians costofliving expenses would not be 
included in the fee schedule 
the new formula would replace the current system in which 
payments are based on customary prevailing and reasonable fees 
charged in an area 
dr robert graham executive vice president of the american 
academy of family physicians argued that the cost of operating a 
practice in rural areas is higher than the cost in a metropolitan 
area 
i support a plan for a single fee for single service 
regardless of speciality or geographic area graham said 
rep jim slattery dkan had told the panel earlier that 
although rural physicians pay less for office space and salaries 
for assistants they usually treat a wide range of problems and 
have more than one office 
slattery had raised the problem of vast discrepancies between 
the reimbursement payments for doctors in metropolitan areas such 
as new york city and beverly hills calif and those in his home 
state of kansas 
specifically he said physicians in all but two counties of 
kansas receive 4968 for a limited consultation while general 
practitioners in new york city receive 4988 and specialists get 
11759 
he also cited the disparity between the payment for 
triplebypass surgery 
the main point of contention however was the commissions 
solution to the increasing cost of medicare expenditures and the 
rise in the number of unnecessary procedures 
the panel proposed imposing expenditure targets which would 
reflect increases in practice costs growth and aging of the 
enrollee population and a decision concerning the appropriate rate 
of increase in volume of services per enrollee 
tied to the targets would be an emphasis on common practice 
guidelines for all physicians in the community 
rep ron wyden dore expressed reservations about 
implementing the targets when adoption of practice guidelines may 
take a few years to work out but lee said the targets should not 
be delayed and the guidelines eventually will be set 
that sounds a little like wishful thinking wyden said 
representatives from the american medical association the 
american society for internal medicine and the american college of 
physicians complained about the expenditure targets saying such a 
plan would force physicians to ration services 
expenditure targets can only work if individual doctors 
decline to provide certain services to their patients that they 
otherwise would have provided said dr joseph f boyle 
executive vice president of the american society of internal 
medicine 
it is also unclear how the medical profession can collectively 
control utilization across the country in order to meet the 
expenditure target boyle said

the nations health care system is 
expensive bureaucratic and often cruel an elderly woman told 
more than 400 people at the first of several hearings by a 
congressional commission 
as one who has faced the problems associated with paying for 
the acute care of my husband and the nursing home care for my 
mother i know firsthand the complexities and costs of our present 
system said grace nelson 80 of edina 
nelson represented the minnesota long term care campaign a 
coalition of various community services organizations with chapters 
in 26 states as well as the minnesota senior federation and the 
minnesota health care coalition 
also testifying at the hearing conducted by the us bipartisan 
commission on comprehensive health care was the rev joseph head a 
90yearold world war i veteran from minneapolis who uses a 
wheelchair his wife he said is bedridden and they cannot afford 
outside help 
we need help longterm care for two patriots who have served 
their country head testified 
we love this country and have always done our part but now we 
are helpless and not getting all we need said head a past 
president of the national chaplains of the veterans of foreign wars 
nelson and head were among more than 20 people who testified as 
the 15member commission began its public inquiry into how to help 
americans who lack health insurance and how to provide longterm 
health care 
us sen david durenberger rminn vice chairman of the 
commission told the hearing that action must be taken to avert 
an impending catastrophe in the american health care system 
noting that some people are unable to get the kind of care 
readily available to others he said every american must have 
membership in a health plan which provides financial access to 
health care and manages the provision of all medical services 
the commission will submit its final report to congress in 
november after conducting six more hearings around the country it 
includes 12 congressmen and three white house appointees 
many of those testifying were in tears 
ive worked hard to make a good life for me and jennifer 
sue stevens of st louis park said of her 12yearold daughter but 
she said they are unable to obtain medical insurance for their 
asthma and other allergies 
i dont know how much longer i can go on each day wondering if 
our healthcare problems are going to drag us down stevens said 
james reinertsen a rheumatologist and president of park 
nicollet medical center where the hearing was held suggested an 
approach to the medical haves and havenots 
the average american he said uses more services than necessary 
to maintain good health he called on the haves to give up 
coverage of such procedures as baldness treatment breast 
reductions and wart removal so that the havenots could receive 
basic coverage 
i believe that reduction in healthcare costs for those 
americans who now enjoy overinsurance would be more than enough to 
pay for the costs of those who now have no insurance he said

former housing secretary samuel pierce on 
thursday defended his handling of a subsidy program that an 
auditors report said favored wellconnected republicans 
pierce said he did not suspend the program as recommended by 
the auditors because he believed changes to the program had 
alleviated many of its problems 
the department of housing and urban development program provided 
indirect subsidies for rehabilitation of privately owned lowincome 
housing projects jack kemp the current housing secretary last 
month suspended awards under the program pending further review 
the hud inspector general said his audit found a pattern during 
the reagan administration in which former department officials and 
other republicans received a large share of project awards either 
as developers or as consultants to developers 
among those cited by the inspector generals report was former 
interior secretary james watt who was reported receiving a 
300000 consulting fee on a maryland project 
pierce drew an angry response from rep barney frank dmass 
when he told a house government operations subcommittee that the 
auditors report focused on republicans and that he would like to 
see how those affliated with the democratic party benefited from 
this program 
i think what you were trying to do was deflect some of the 
blame making irresponsible statements that you cant back up 
said frank 
it was pierces first public response to the inspector generals 
report which claimed the program was riddled with favoritism 
and mismanagement 
pierce reagans sole black cabinet member who remained at hud 
throughout the eight years of the administration denied that 
projects pushed by wellconnected republicans got any greater 
consideration than others 
pierce said he had one meeting with watt but no promises were 
made to him 
he said he would have advised housing authorities and developers 
who hired consultants that they were wasting their money 
there are other ways of getting to the people at hud pierce 
said without elaborating 
pierce defended his decision not to carryout the inspector 
generals recommendation to suspend the program awards 
i did not cavalierly disregard it the igs recommendation 
he said 
the ig is not god he added defending his decision to give 
a 3member selection committee full discretion in selecting which 
projects would be funded 
the former housing secretary admitted he had final authority 
over the committees decisions although he automatically approved 
every project selection made by the panel since he received no 
complaints about the process 
rep bruce morrison dconn reminded pierce that congress had 
ordered hud to considered funding requests from public housing 
authorities not specific projects or developers

farmers whose crops are lost to drought this 
year would get relief from a bill passed thursday by the house 
agriculture committee 
the original purpose of the legislation was to extend the 1988 
drought relief emergency bill to cover winter wheat crops being 
harvested this year 
but the amendments offered by lawmakers from nonwheat states 
that could also experience drought problems expanded the bill to 
cover many more crops 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter told the committee through 
a letter that he would not recommend that president bush sign the 
bill unless it was budget neutral applicable only to 1989 
crops affected by drought and accompanied by a promise that 
congress would agree to use crop insurance as the sole vehicle for 
disaster assistance after this year 
i think we are in the ballpark said kika de la garza 
dtexas chairman of the agriculture committee after the vote 
he said the improvements to the crop insurance program would not 
be ready in time for action on this bill but the progress the 
house is making should stand as an indication that continued 
emergency relief like this legislation will not be necessary in the 
future 
the secretary is going to say how much does it the bill 
cost said john campbell deputy agriculture secretary in charge 
of commodities we have a lot of work to do in analyzing the 
bill 
he praised the strict crop insurance component of the bill but 
noted that policy changes would have to be made in how crop 
insurance works 
the adminstration wants farmers to purchase crop insurance 
rather than depending on the government to always bail them out 
when bad weather causes crop failures but farmers are unhappy with 
the current crop insurance program and havent been participating 
the bill requires them to buy insurance for 1990 as a 
qualification for getting relief for 1989 
rep dan glickman dkan chairman of the subcommittee on 
wheat soybeans and feed grains called the inclusion in the bill 
of crops besides winter wheat a political accommodation to 
lawmakers from other states 
i think we can sell this program said glickman 
de la garza estimated that the bill would cost about 1 billion 
in relief payments which is close to the amount of money the 
government has saved in assistance payments to wheat farmers 
in other words the drought caused a shortage in supply which 
means higher prices and no need for government subsidies the money 
that had been set aside for the subsidies would be used to pay the 
farmers who lost their crops to drought 
thats why the lawmakers call the legislation budget neutral 
glickman said the money farmers would receive in relief 
however is not as much as they would have gotten if they had had a 
crop 
its about a third he said

a federal judge considering whether to block 
the largest demolition of public housing stepped over a pile of 
trash and broken furniture thursday as he toured a building that is 
slated for dynamiting 
us district judge dickinson r debevoise passed through the 
dim graffitimarred hallways in the kretchmer homes project to 
gather background for the court case that is before him 
i can visualize better what the plaintiffs are talking about 
on paper said the judge who has been attempting to mediate the 
dispute 
the kretchmer homes complex was begun in 1953 but already 
vandalism and neglect have taken their toll and the project is now 
only about onethird occupied 
in one vacant apartment debevoise stepped over a ripped 
mattress and trash piled on the floor passed tattered wallpaper 
and gaping holes in the walls 
he paused briefly at a large window in the eightstory building 
to peer through dirty broken panes of glass at a barren complex of 
12 similar buildings across the dusty courtyard 
housing officials are seeking to demolish kretchmers 730 units 
and more than 5000 other governmentbuilt apartments elsewhere in 
newark more public housing than any other city has demolished 
fighting the proposal is a coalition of tenants and homeless 
advocates 
the whole silly notion of having these buildings torn down is 
beyond me said modesto hill 22 who has lived in the kretchmer 
project for 19 years he spoke thursday as he and his mother 
prepared to move to another apartment while the judge toured 
elsewhere in the building 
the battle in this city where onethird of the 316000 
residents receive public assistance reflects a national trend by 
housing authorities who say highrise projects are unmanageable and 
dangerous and should be replaced by townhouses and lowrise 
buildings 
highrise housing in a lot of areas is a concept that just 
doesnt work said bill glavin a spokesman for the us 
department of housing and urban development 
the targeted projects in newark are beyond redemption 
despite millions of dollars poured into them for renovation sid 
pamela goldstein a spokeswoman for mayor sharpe james 
when you pile people in degrading circumstances on top of one 
another it just doesnt lend itself to good living she said 
but activists contend that with thousands of people living on 
the streets an estimated 16000 homeless in newark and up to 3 
million nationwide demolition is folly 
they urge other solutions closer tenant management that might 
cut down on vandalism reconfiguration of apartments and hallways 
keeping families with children on lower floors and renovation 
through grants 
rather than try to solve the problems they decided to 
eliminate them said melville d miller jr president of legal 
services of new jersey and a signer of the court suit that 
debevoise is considering 
the first major project to be razed was st louis pruittigoe 
complex which were destroyed in the mid1970s after only about 20 
years of use the site is still vacant 
from 1982 to 1987 more than 12500 of 14 million federally 
funded apartments were dynamited glavin said just wednesday a 
10story building was demolished by the wrecking ball in 
providence ri after attempts to bring it down with dynamite 
failed 
similar actions are planned in jacksonville fla bridgeport 
conn houston and new orleans friday marks the deadline for 
housing authorities to submit requests for federal funds to replace 
demolished apartments glavin said about 20 communities had 
applied but he could not identify them 
the lawsuit before debevoise names the newark housing authority 
and hud which itself has criticized the authority for 
mismanagement 
the newark authority eighthlargest in the nation controls 
13000 apartments and has a waiting list of 10000 families nearly 
40 percent of the apartments are vacant including many of those 
awaiting demolition more than 800 units have already been razed 
the authority plans to replace the highrises eventually with 
smaller more manageable builings and to combine subsidized and 
marketrate homes the suit alleges that those replacement plans 
are inadequate citing a 1988 federal law requiring each demolished 
apartment to be replaced 
activists largely have been unsuccessful in legal challenges to 
the demolition of deteriorating public housing elsewhere but 
debevoise who before he became a judge was the founder of the 
states first legal project for the poor has tried to settle the 
dispute here 
the parties agreed to debevoises temporary ban on demolition 
and he took the unusual action of assigning a mediator to meet with 
them ordering weekly updates 
i knew from the outset that this was a nowin situation in the 
litigation context he said 
the temporary halting of demolition has not halted the citys 
effort to relocate tenants from buildings that are on the 
demolition list 
hill and his mother are among the lucky ones because they are 
being relocated to a modern subsidized townhouse rather than 
another highrise that might also be targeted for destruction 
as she packed belongings thursday she pointed out new cabinets 
and fixtures in the kitchen she was leaving behind the vandals 
she said are going to come tonight to strip all this out of 
here

two environmental groups joined the state of 
california and the aflcio on thursday in suing the environmental 
protection agency for allegedly failing to protect consumers from 
dangerous pesticides in food 
the suit asks that the federal courts require the epa to impose 
more stringent regulations on cancercausing chemicals in food 
especially in processed fruits and vegetables often consumed by 
small children 
al meyerhoff an attorney for the natural resources defense 
council said the suit is aimed at forcing the epa to be more 
aggressive in prohibiting the use of pesticides on food and to ban 
them altogether if they are found to cause cancer 
under current epa procedures the agency allows the use of some 
older pesticides even though agency officials concede that if the 
same chemicals were newly introduced they would not be approved 
because of health concerns 
the agency is in the midst of reexamining scores of older 
pesticides using current health criteria but that process could 
take years 
at the same time the agency applies a negligible risk test 
when determining whether a cancercausing chemical should continue 
to be used banning it if the increased risk is one in one million 
the suit asks the court to direct the epa to automatically take a 
chemical off the market for food use if there is any proof it is 
carcinogenic no matter what the expected risk 
the suit filed in us district court in sacramento calif 
accused the epa of a consistent failure to carry out the 
requirements of the food drug and cosmetic act which requires the 
regulation of unsafe residues from pesticides on food products 
the epa had no comment on the suit 
jay vroom executive vice president of the national agricultural 
chemicals association criticized the suit as a political move 
for additional publicity to further confuse and confound the 
public about the dangers of pesticides in food 
the industry has consistently argued that the levels of 
pesticides in food products is so low as to pose no health danger 
in addition to the natural resources defense council plaintiffs 
in the lawsuit are public citizen a private environmetnal and 
consumer group in washington the state attorney general of 
california and the aflcio the nrdc is a private nonprofit 
environmental organization 
the suit also charges the epa with not requiring enough 
information from processsed food manufacturers to determine residue 
levels of many pesticides including some that have been found to 
cause cancer 
the law requires epa to identify cancercausing pesticides in 
processed foods by refusing to collect the data and to apply 
the law epa jeopardizes the public health and violates the public 
trust said william schultz an attorney for public citizen a 
private environmental and consumer group 
in addition to the suit the plaintiffs filed a petition with 
the epa asking that seven cancercausing pesticides immediately be 
banned in processed foods they argued such a ban is required under 
a 1958 law although the chemicals were in use prior to that 
these pesticides have been found to have higher concentrations 
of residues in processed foods than in raw agricultural products 
the petition maintains and should be subject to a provision of the 
1958 law that prohibits any levels of a carcinogenic pesticide in 
certain foods 
the epa has said that the socalled delaney clause in the 1958 
law does not apply to pesticides that were approved for use prior 
to the laws enactment even though latest tests showed them to be 
carcinogenic in such cases the agency allowed if they are 
perceived to pose merely a negligible risk 
the plaintiffs claim there are at leat 20 pesticides now allowed 
by the epa in processed foods despite links of various degrees to 
cancer

ariel sharon israels most charismatic and 
provocative politician is leading a rightwing revolt against 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs peace plan and the governments 
failure to put down the palestinian uprising 
we are very late we wasted 18 months but i think that the 
first thing the israeli government should deal with now is how to 
restore law and order said sharon the former defense minister 
who was the architect of israels invasion of lebanon in 1982 
slamming shamirs proposal to hold elections in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip sharon added that the perpetrators of 
terror and violence would first have to be deaddeported or behind 
bars 
his message sparked applause and cries of arik for defense 
minister from the nearly 100 likud bloc central committee 
members members of parliament and exarmy pals who crowded into 
the living room of sharons heavily guarded apartment in the moslem 
quarter of the walled old city 
sharon the trade and industry minister is holding a series of 
meetings before a showdown with shamir on the peace plan at a 
meeting of the 3000member likud central committee tentatively 
set for midjune 
sharons sevenpoint counterplan calls for the governnment to 
give first priority to ending the intefadeh or uprising which has 
claimed nearly 500 palestinian and 22 israeli lives 
it also demand jerusalem be excluded from any peace negotiations 
and the 130 jewish settlements in the occupied west bank and gaza 
officially be made part of israeli territory 
shamir 73 has threatened to resign if he doesnt win 
endorsement for his peace strategy 
it is uncertain if sharon will succeed in galvanizing rightwing 
support but israeli anger has been on the rise evidenced by an 
antifada of israeli stonethrowing attacks on arab motorists 
and vigilante raids by settlers on arab villages 
the rotund whitehaired sharon listened occasionally jotting 
notes on the palm or back of his left hand as supporters in his 
living room aired their frustrations over the armys inability to 
stop the uprising 
one man said the uprising could have been stopped with single 
machine gun if the army had killed 20 palestinians after the first 
riot broke out in december 1987 a man in a wheelchair said any 
palestinian who threw a stone should have his house torn down and 
more serious offenders should be expelled 
yehoshua saguy former head of military intelligence and likud 
member of parliament told the audience whoever doesnt act today 
will have to act tomorrow because anarchy is taking over in the 
streets 
shamir defense minister yitzhak rabin and lt gen dan shomron 
the chief of staff were attacked for being too soft on rioters 
to many sharon is seen as the only israeli leader who has the 
daring to shrug off world criticism and get the job done 
he is remembered as the cando general who crushed a palestinian 
insurgency in gaza in 1970 and the hero who ended the 1973 
arabisraeli war with a daring strike across the suez canal that 
encircled egypts third army 
a survey of 1206 israelis by the independent modiin ezrachi 
agency indicated israelis believed he could do a better job ending 
the uprising than anyone else for example he got 444 percent 
backing to 205 percent for rabin whose job it is to put down the 
revolt the remaining percentage was scattered 
sharons critics however note his military record was blotted 
by acts of harshness such as the reprisal raid on the jordanian 
town of qibia in 1953 when his unit 101 commandos blew up a row of 
houses killing 69 men women and children sharon contended he was 
unaware the houses were occupied 
sharon was also forced to resign the defense ministers post in 
1983 after a judicial commission found he was indirectly 
responsible for the sabra and chatilla massacre of at least 800 
palestinians in beirut it said he failed to forsee the danger of 
allowing christian militiamen into the camps 
sharon 61 with characteristic selfconfidence said in an 
interview he was the man to end the palestinian uprising just as he 
did the 1970 gaza revolt when the army built wide roads through 
the refugee camps set up ambushes for guerrillas and resettled 
several thousand gazans in the sinai desert 
in gaza it took us seven months day and night but the 
government was determined then to bring and end to terror and 
violence and we did it he said adding that all that was needed 
now was resolve 
its not that israel does not have strength israel has 
military strength and economic strength the problem is the 
weakness of the national will but in my opinion its all still in 
our hands he said

foreign minister nguyen co thach said 
thursday he expects normal relations with the united states to be 
achieved next year after vietnam ends its decadeold military 
occupation of cambodia 
the united states has repeatedly stated that relations with 
vietnam would be normalized after complete withdrawal of vietnamese 
troops he said hanoi has promised its soldiers will be out of 
cambodia by sept 30 
i am of the opinion that the united states will keep the words 
of a big country thach said in an interview with the associated 
press the sooner it is normalized the better and it is better 
late than never 
asked when he said the middle course meaning a reasonable 
guess would be next year 
it is the end of the tunnel he said of the cambodian 
conflict now we can get out of the tunnel 
central to any peace agreement is prince norodom sihanouk 
former ruler of cambodia and now leader of the guerrilla alliance 
who has been negotiating with the vietnamsponsored government 
thach said sihanouk often has changed his behavior and tactics 
but always had the same objective to be head of state since the 
provietnamese government now has offered him that post the 
foreign minister said i dont think he will miss the 
opportunity 
washington has not recognized the communist government that has 
ruled all of vietnam since winning the war in april 1975 the 
carter administration came close to recognition in the 1970s but 
that fell apart when vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 
the united states which supports the cambodian resistance has 
said it will not consider ending its trade and aid embargo or 
establishing relations until the last vietnamese troops leave 
relations with the united states are essential if vietnam is to 
get the aid and investment necessary to develop its economy one of 
the worlds poorest 
vietnam also has been pressing china to fulfill what hanoi says 
was its pledge to discuss restoring normal relations once vietnam 
began withdrawing from cambodia china supports the rebels and the 
soviet union backs vietnam 
in recent years the united states and vietnam have made rapid 
progress on humanitarian issues including resettlement of refugees 
and migrants to the united states and resolving the fates of 
american soldiers still listed as missing in action 
private us citizens also have increased their contacts with

britain expelled four czechoslovak diplomats 
thursday a week after ordering out 11 soviets prime minister 
margaret thatcher said the crackdown was vital regardless of the 
effect upon our relations 
in moscow the kgb said it had evidence that three british 
journalists expelled last week engaged in spying it was the first 
time the soviets had published detailed accusations against the 
three 
the employers of the british journalists denied the charges one 
calling them part of the titfortat going on at the moment 
the foreign office accused the four czechoslovaks of 
activities incompatible with their status diplomatic parlance 
for spying and said they must go within two weeks 
foreign office political director sir john fretwell summoned 
czechoslovak ambassador jan fidler and said britain deeply 
regretted that the prague government ignored a warning to rein in 
diplomats last september when three others were expelled 
in the house of commons mrs thatcher brushed aside opposition 
charges she is jeopardizing what had been britains best relations 
with the soviet union since world war ii 
the action had to be taken regardless of the effect upon our 
relations she said the worst thing of all would have been to 
say because we had better relations we could ignore those 
unacceptable activities 
she said such activities were uncovered both in the soviet 
embassy we have to take action against them and also in the 
czech embassy 
fidler termed the british allegations totally unfounded 
an embassy spokeswoman who demanded anonymity said fidler told 
fretwell the move undermined britishczechoslovak relations and 
damages positive developments in europe as well 
the czechoslovaks ordered expelled were jan pavlicek 39 third 
secretary and press attache helena krepelkova 38 a second 
secretary jan sarkocy 35 third secretary and rudolf 
kasparovsky 35 technical adviser 
the expulsions reflected a tough stance with communist countries 
despite what mrs thatcher has hailed as the end of the cold 
war as soviet president mikhail s gorbachev pursues his reform 
policies despite giving gorbachev a warm welcome on a visit six 
weeks ago britain has complained that soviet agents continue 
widespread espionage 
britain has also sought better relations with czechoslovakia 
partly to get help in trying to make more detectable the 
czechoslovakmanufactured explosive semtex used by the irish 
republican army and other militant groups 
the foreign office said fretwell made a point thursday of 
thanking fidler for czechoslovak cooperation over semtex 
foreign office officials said allegations against the expelled 
soviets and czechoslovaks were not linked 
the 11 britons expelled from the soviet union included eight 
diplomats and three journalists 
in moscow thursday kgb spokesman vladimir strunin told a news 
conference that competent organs possess information that 
testifies to the involvement of these journalists with british 
intelligence services 
the journalists jeremy harris of the british broadcasting 
corp ian gloverjames of independent television news and angus 
roxburgh of the sunday times on saturday were given 14 days to 
leave the soviet union 
britain said the move was revenge for britains decision on 
friday to expel 11 londonbased soviets also eight diplomats and 
three journalists accused of spying 
the most serious accusation leveled was against roxburgh the 
kgb accused him of trying to enlist a soviet citizen to obtain 
information on unspecified government installations 
it said roxburgh gave the soviet equipment for listening and 
recording telephone conversations and promised to pay a monetary 
reward for information that was interesting it also accused him of 
violating regulations that restrict foreigners travel in the 
soviet union 
andrew neil editor of the sunday times said the charges 
announced earlier thursday by the soviet kgb were obviously part of 
continuing intergovernment reprisals 
these allegations are clearly absurd and obviously part of the 
titfortat going on at the moment neil said the bbc and 
independent television news also denied the charges

the leader of the sudan peoples liberation 
army is coming to the united states on his first official visit to 
seek support for his organizations war against the usbacked 
government an organizer said thursday 
john garang will meet with members of congress and journalists 
during his threeday visit beginning june 6 said roger winter 
director of the private nonprofit united states committee for 
refugees 
he will also be granted meetings with state department officials 
if he asks said an administration source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
garang is coming at the invitation of former president jimmy 
carter who has undertaken an attempt to advance negotiations 
between the spla and the government in khartoum winter said 
carter visited sudan in april meeting with government officials 
and with garangs lieutenants but the spla chief was in the 
bush at the time and did not meet with carter winter said he 
will meet with him in georgia before coming to washington 
carters mission had the blessing of the bush administration 
which has made an end to the sudanese civil war a priority item on 
its foreign policy agenda 
assistant secretary of state herman cohen visited khartoum 
earlier this week for talks with the government on ending the war 
and he plans to meet too with representatives of the spla said the 
administration official 
cohen will also discuss the sudan situation with his soviet 
counterpart in rome this weekend the official said 
the spla began fighting in 1983 demanding greater autonomy for 
the southern provinces which are populated mainly by christians and 
animists the rebels and their supporters in the west accuse the 
moslemdominated government of waging genocide against the 
southerners by preventing food convoys from reaching them and by 
attacking population centers controlled by the spla 
in recent months garangs troops have scored successive 
victories over government forces and consolidated their control of 
the south 
but in early may garang announced a unilateral onemonth 
ceasefire to assist a unsponsored relief program that is trying 
to stockpile enough food to save some 100000 sudanese from 
starving both sides have used food as a weapon in the war 
resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths 
garang a useducated renegade army colonel is seeking to 
build up public opinion and official support in the united states 
in the event that negotiations get underway with the usbacked 
government winter said 
the government has shown some willingness to discuss a peace 
proposal offered by the spla last year but moslem fundamentalists 
have so far derailed the process

opposition leaders toured a hospital 
thursday to the cheers of hundreds of patients visitors and 
employees and said they will keep fighting they until they win 
recognition of having won the election 
it was the fifth time the candidates defied a government ban on 
demonstrations which is in effect until a visiting organization of 
american states delegation turns in its report 
opposition presidential candidate guillermo endara and his two 
running mates told oas delegates wednesday that they won the may 7 
election and want their victory recognized and panamas ruler gen 
manuel antonio noriega ousted 
the oas can help in one of two ways either by starting us on 
the road to a negotiated solution or by establishing a strict 
quarantine of the noriega regime said ricardo arias calderon 
the candidate for first vice president 
arias calderon said the candidates campaignstyle appearances 
were meant as a message of faith in ourselves 
were telling the government we will continue to fight he 
said 
the oas mission was sent to help fashion a solution to panamas 
political impasse following the vote the delegation had no 
meetings scheduled thursday a spokesman said 
international observers say the endara ticket won the 
presidential vote by a 3to1 margin but the government nullified 
the vote claiming that foreign interference made an accurate vote 
tally impossible 
the oas then condemned noriega and called for a transfer of 
power in panama 
noriegas backers claimed their presidential candidate carlos 
duque had been ahead by 21 when the election was voided 
in his meeting with the oas delegation wednesday noriega blamed 
panamas crisis on a long history of us intervention 
in brief comments to reporters noriega warned it would be a 
dangerous precedent for the oas to do anything that would be 
considered interference in another countrys internal affairs 
today its panama tomorrow it could be any other country 
he said 
maj edgardo lopez a noriega spokesman said oas delegates 
raised the issue of noriegas retirement during one meeting but 
that officers said they were loyal to noriega and the question 
would be decided by the defense forces 
noriega holds power through his command of the defense forces 
which have remained faithful despite us and opposition signals 
that a coup would be welcome 
in thursdays visit to the public social security hospital in 
panama city the opposition candidates were greeted by chanting 
autographhunting crowds on every floor 
operating room staff members in green gowns caps masks and 
gloves emerged briefly into a waiting room 
im between operations but i have to get back to work said 
one after joining a chant of justice justice 
that beautiful man kissed me boasted one woman to friends 
in a waiting room after she hugged endara 
a nurse who works in the hospital laboratory said conditions 
have grown worse in the last few years 
we have minimal supplies she said we have to get rid of 
the corruption 
the first demonstrations against noriega began in june 1987 he 
was indicted in florida on us drug charges in february 1988 and 
us economic sanctions were imposed on the panamanian government 
noriega denies the charges and called them part of a us plot 
to abrogate treaties under which panama gains control of the panama 
canal at the end of 1999

the sun warmed to the occasion thursday 
powering the entries in the first american tour de sol a race for 
solarpowered cars from vermont to massachusetts 
the trip which takes four hours for internal combustionengined 
vehicles will take these competitors four days 
all five entries plus a pintsize speedster driven by a 
preschooler had large panels of photovoltaic cells which turn 
sunlight into electricity to run electric motors and charge 
batteries 
the solar cars were running the route in four legs of several 
hours each day with overnight stops at hanover nh concord 
nh and lowell mass before reaching the finish line scheduled 
sunday at the massachusetts institute of technology in cambridge 
mass 
the mit entry solectria v easily won the first leg of the race 
thursday covering the 59 miles from the statehouse lawn in 
montpelier to the dartmouth college green in just under 1 hour 40 
minutes 
the car entered by the new hampshire technical institute from 
concord finished second in 23317 and the dartmouth college 
entry finished in about 301 
the worcester mass polytechnic institute team had what it 
called lastminute bugs that caused it to take more than seven 
hours to arrive at dartmouth and a unique wedgeshaped vehicle 
brought by a twoman team from alabama broke down on the first leg 
of the race 
participants said they hoped for thursdays sunny weather to 
continue through sunday clouds could make it impossible to finish 
the race in the four days allocated 
race organizer jim kirby of the brattleborobased northeast 
solar energy association said the aim of the event is to promote 
interest in and development of cleaner transportation technologies 
only a few years ago this would have been thought of as a 
rather novel and bizarre event said gov madeleine kunin who 
waved a flag to start the race thursday morning 
but with heightened concern over environmental damage caused by 
cars she said the racers might be offering a preview of what 
life will be like in a couple of years 
costs of the solarpowered vehicles were said to range from 
about 10000 in materials plus labor for the new hampshire 
technical institute entry to 30000 for the stateoftheart model 
from mit 
one of the mit innovations is brakes that when applied 
generate electricity to help recharge the batteries said team 
member lee weinstein of lexington mass 
the four school cars were of a basic streamlined design 
the fifth car an independent entry driven by ed passarini of 
tuscaloosa ala was taller and roomier this is the commuter 
passarini said you can carry your groceries in this one 
and then there was the sixth vehicle in the race the favorite 
entry of many but sure not to finish said the drivers mother 
fouryearold ian cotter of waldoboro maine showed off and 
then took off down the road after the others in a solarpowered 
minicar bearing a big number 6 that his father designed and 
built for him 
asked how fast it would go ian said about five miles 
organizers said it is the first race of its kind in the united 
states and was modeled on an event that has been held annually in 
switzerland since 1982 
kirby said some of the cars can top 70 mph going downhill he 
said they can get about two hours of use for about eight hours of 
the suns recharging that makes them ideal for commuting he 
said 
dartmouth driver lara horner and others said a key part of the 
strategy is not to go too fast uphill that really runs the 
batteries down she said 
new hampshire tech driver don king said one of the best features 
of the cars is their novelty its really neat people wave 
their jaws drop open 
he said hes never been stopped by police but a couple of 
times they nearly snapped their necks when we went by

gunned down and killed in la paz and leftwing terrorists who 
claimed reponsibiliity threatened a war to the death against 
yankee invaders 
todd ray wilson of wellington and jeffrey brent ball from 
wanship were returning to their home in a poor suburb late 
wednesday when unidentified men shot them with machine guns one of 
the victims died immediately the other on the way to a hospital 
both were 20 years old 
the radical zarate willka armed liberation front claimed 
responsibility shortly after the shootings it is the same group 
that last summer tried to kill former secretary of state george 
shultz when he was visiting la paz 
the violation of our sovereignty cannot go unpunished the 
revolutionaries said in a statement the yankee invaders who come 
to massacre our fellow farmers are warned we the poor have no 
other road than to rise up in arms 
our hatred is implacable and our war is to death 
the slain missionaries lived in a neighborhood around the corner 
from a church that was seriously damaged by a bomb explosion last 
year local church president stephen r wright said in an interview 
two other bombs have been planted in the past nine months he 
said one dmaaged a church and another was discovered before it 
exploded 
we are being targeted unfairly and inappropriately as being 
imperialists wright said we have been targeted because we 
have a high profile our missionaries wear shirts and ties and we 
have nice churches 
police say they have no suspects in the killings or bombings 
us embassy spokesman mark jacobs said american officials will 
work closely with bolivian investigators 
the us embassy in la paz deplores and condems the 
assaassination of two american citizens in la paz in an act that 
can only be described as coldblooded murder jacobs said 
the slayings were the first politically motivated killings of 
mormon missionaries in memory spokesman don lefevre said at the 
churchs headquarters in salt lake city 
they have died as martyrs in the cause of the lord we extend 
our love and sympathy to their families and pray that they may be 
comforted and sustained in this hour of tragedy the governing 
first presidency of the mormon faith said in a statement 
wright said ball and wilson came to bolivia voluntarily and at 
their own expense nearly a year ago to preach the gospel and enrich 
lives of bolivians there are about 40000 mormons in the country 
i feel great sadness and anger at the loss of these fine young 
men wright said 
all young mormon males are encouraged to serve two years as 
missionaries older couples and women serve 18 months 
church officials said the an autopsy was conducted thursday and 
bodies of the missionaries would be flown to utah this weekend 
last year the terrorists claimed responsibility for a bomb that 
exploded near vehicles carrying shultz his wife and delegates in 
la paz for talks with government officials no one was injured in

richard l armitage a top defense department 
official throughout the reagan administration and tapped by 
president bush as the next secretary of the army has decided to 
leave government service the pentagon said thursday 
armitage currently the assistant defense secretary for 
international security affairs has asked that the president 
withdraw his name from consideration for army secretary said 
peter williams the pentagons chief spokesman 
mr armitage also has asked to be relieved of his current 
duties effective june 5 rich armitage has been one of the 
mainstays of the department of defense since 1981 he will be 
greatly missed by his colleagues in the government 
williams quoted armitage as writing in his letter of resignation 
that he could no longer accomodate the needs of my evergrowing 
family with the time and travel demands of public service 
the army needs fulltime dedicated leadership i regret to 
say that i find myself at present after over eight years of 
80hour work weeks unable to face that challenge armitage wrote 
armitage has eight children and williams said his family 
priorities were certainly unassailable 
bush told armitage he was withdrawing the nomination with 
regrets your years of work to build strong defenses for america 
and its allies and friends around the world has earned the 
gratitude of the nation you have helped to renew the bonds of 
americas alliances and bring freedom and democracy to people who 
have never enjoyed them before bush wrote 
williams had no information on whether armitage already had 
found a new job in private industry a secretary in armitages 
office said he was unavailable for comment and would not be in the 
office the rest of the week 
the 43yearold armitage early this year had been slated to 
leave the pentagon for an executive position at the state 
department but defense secretary dick cheney prevailed on him to 
stay with the promise of a higher service secretary position 
in his current job armitage played a major role in policymaking 
in the persian gulf in the ouster of philippine leader ferdinand 
marcos and in overseeing foreign military assistance programs 
williams said thursday he had no information on whether cheney 
and president bush had selected a replacement for the army post

a federal appeals court upheld the right of a 
profoundly retarded boy to be educated at public expense and a 
disability advocate said thursday that the ruling lifts a threat to 
special education 
the ruling issued wednesday by the 1st us circuit court of 
appeals here overturned a us district court ruling last july in 
new hampshire which said the boy was not entitled to publicly 
financed educational services because he could not benefit from 
them 
the higher court ruled that the 1975 federal education for all 
handicapped children act means what the title suggests a school 
district has a duty to provide an educational program to every 
handicapped child in the district regardless of the severity of 
the handicap 
i feel it is a reaffirmation of what i thought was clear all 
along that all handicapped students are entitled to an 
education said attorney ronald lospennato who represented the 
14yearold boy identified only as timothy w and the disabilities 
rights center 
but attorney gerald zelin who represented the rochester nh 
school district warned that the ruling could expose cities and 
towns across the country to potentially unlimited costs for 
programs that will have minimal impact 
zelin said the town might appeal the ruling to the us supreme 
court 
the statute defines handicapped children as those who need or 
require special education zelin said the district argues that 
a child who cant benefit cannot need or require it 
nationwide zelin said as many as 10 percent of all schoolage 
children qualify for special education although most of them have 
relatively mild disabilities and can be accommodated in mainstream 
classrooms 
for children with extraordinary or multiple handicaps however 
the cost to local government can be high day programs can cost 
5000 to 10000 or more per year and residential placements can 
cost more than 50000 a year 
zelin said congress never appropriated more than about 300 a 
year per pupil under the law which covers young people from age 3 
to age 21 
if tim were to remain in a day program at 10000 to 20000 a 
year thats not going to break rochesters budget it is on the 
other hand arguably a waste of public resources for 20000 you 
could hire another whole teacher zelin said 
its a real headversusheart case zelin said 
the boys attorney agreed that funding was an issue but argued 
that the law raises questions beyond the school districts budget 
first of all timothy is clearly the type of kid where society 
has some obligation lospennato said he is going to be or 
could be an extraordinary expense for anybody one way or another 
if it isnt the school district its going to be some other social 
service agency 
more than that the failure to provide services will result in 
more expense to taxpayers he said arguing that if the town had 
paid for services beginning when timothy was 3 he might not need 
such expensive services now 
the dispute began in 1978 when timothy turned 3 and the town 
rebuffed his familys request for an educational program in 1984 
the case went to us district court in new hampshire 
in court hearings the boys mother and therapists testified 
that timothy could hear see bright light and respond to music 
touching and talking but a developmental pediatrician testified 
that timothy did not have educational needs and could not benefit 
from an education 
rochester school superintendent raymond yeagley said the 
appellate courts ruling will force the school district to shift 
resources from students who could benefit from education to those 
who may not 
school districts are getting to the point they are asked to do 
everything and spend more on education services than education 
said gwendolyn gregory deputy general counsel of the national 
school boards association in washington which filed a brief siding 
with the town

firstdegree perjury attempting to influence a public servant 
false reporting and tampering with physical evidence they were 
immediately suspended without pay 
el paso county district attorney john suthers and his chief 
deputy robert brown serving as special prosecutors filed the 
charges in denver and arapahoe county courts following a twoweek 
investigation 
this is something we dont like to see said police 
spokesman bill phillips were not in a position to break rules 
obviously something was wrong something was not monitored 
any time you file charges against a public official its not 
great said arapahoe county district attorney bob gallagher 
this is not a happy time i do have faith in the criminal justice 
system that everything comes out okay 
questions about denvers socalled super cops operation came 
to light during an investigation of a burglary in the arapahoe 
county city of littleton last june that was allegedly staged for 
television 
cinquanta and subia allegedly paid an informant to get john 
lefebre and martha bell to burglarize a littleton residence police 
and kmghtv of denver were at the home when the burglary attempt 
was made and officers arrested lefebre and ball 
englewood attorney robert ransome told prosecutors that lefebre

allegedly helped break into the home but was allowed to escape 
after evidence surfaced that the burglary may have been set up 
by denver police the arapahoe county district attorneys office 
dropped felony charges against lefebre and bell 
the denver charges stem from a robbery case a year ago in which 
subia and cinquanta allegedly gave false testimony at pretrial 
hearings 
roy lee tyler and dale robinson were convicted in the case but 
in march denver district attorney norm early said the two would be 
released because of the possibility that tainted testimony had been 
given 
cinquantas attorney expressed disappointment and surprise 
wednesday after his client and subia were charged 
we thought there might not be any charges filed at all 
robert dill said weve presented a lot of information and had 
the expectation that would prove beyond a reasonable doubt the 
officers innocence 
dill said cinquanta is sad and upset that hes been charged 
but hes confident he will be vindicated and im not just 
saying that 
in arapahoe county cinquanta is charged with one count of 
attempting to influence a public servant and three counts of filing 
false police reports subia is charged with one count of perjury 
one count of attempting to influence a public servant and one count 
of filing a false report 
in denver county cinquanta faces two counts of perjury and five 
counts of attempting to influence a public servant subia has been 
charged with one count of perjury and two counts of attempting to

lawmakers have struck a deal that saves the 
state agriculture department from extinction but strips the 
embattled commissioner of his power over pesticide regulation 
officials said thursday 
commissioner jim hightower had angered conservatives and 
chemical interests with tough new pesticide rules his department 
wrote and enforces he upset others with his efforts to sell 
hormonefree beef to europe earlier this year 
republican gov bill clements who has the power to veto the 
agriculture department out of existence as some have urged 
promised to sign a compromise bill that would turn pesticide 
regulation over to an independent board 
it would mean a more reasoned more effective more consistent 
and more coordinated enforcement of pesticide rules clements 
said in a statement that never named hightower a democrat and 
selfdescribed populist 
hightowers press secretary andy welch said the twoterm 
commissioner would wait until the legislature finishes with the 
bill before commenting 
under the compromise a new ninemember agricultural resources 
protection authority would set all policies and regulations on 
pesticide use 
the board would coordinate efforts of all state agencies 
including the water commission and structural pest control board 
which rule on pesticide use 
the panel would be headed by the agriculture commissioner and 
include officials from universities and state agencies the 
governor would appoint a consumer member and an agricultural 
producer 
the plan also requires that licensed pesticide applicators 
private farmers or commercial applicators ensure that their 
employees are familiar with the pesticides they work with said 
glenn smith an aide to lt gov bill hobby who proposed the 
provision 
a key part of the deal says the new board cant weaken existing 
rules said state rep lena guerrero a former farm worker 
they are not allowed to change a law when the effect would 
be less protective of the publics health safety or welfare she 
said 
creation of the board appeared to be the best deal hightowers 
allies could get ms guerrero said 
its probably not the best way to set regulatory pesticide 
policy in this state but its a legislative agreement she said 
rep rick perry a hightower opponent called the plan the best 
for all concerned 
ive just got some problems with a single individual with 
total control over the pesticide regulation in this state perry 
said i just think the boards a lot better way to go 
a coalition of 40 agricultural groups that have opposed 
hightower including the texas farm bureau and the texas and 
southwestern cattle raisers association called the board a small 
step in the right direction 
hightowers political problems mounted as the legislature 
considered the agriculture department sunset bill legislation that 
must be approved every 12 years to keep each state agency in 
business 
if the bill fails to pass or is vetoed by clements the 
department would cease to exist on sept 1 1990 if clements signs 
the bill the department would continue for another 12 years 
the texas farm bureau had urged lawmakers to abolish the elected 
agriculture commissioners post and replace it with an appointee 
clements says he only has the power to kill the department and 
doing so wouldnt eliminate the elected commissioners post 
saving the department was a top goal ms guerrero said 
i also wanted to make sure we maintained an elected 
agriculture commissioner she said everybody eats and 
everybody should have a right to elect their agriculture 
commissioner

arab leaders continued arguing 
heatedly thursday about lebanon and differences over syrias 
military presence there threatened to wreck the summit and further 
fragment the arab world 
iraq is insisting on a total withdrawal of all 50000 syrian 
troops in the warplagued country syria resisting pressure from 
its traditional foe is refusing to pull out even from beirut 
where its soldiers and christian lebanese troops battled again 
thursday 
underscoring the general frustration kuwait resigned thursday 
from chairmanship of the leagues sixnation committee on lebanon 
behind closed doors foreign ministers searched for a compromise 
acceptable to syria and iraq which is the only outspoken arab 
supporter of lebanese christian leader gen michel aoun 
iraqi foreign minister tarik aziz told reporters after a 
fivehour session we are still looking at the options the main 
one is for total syrian withdrawal if that is not achieved there 
cannot be a solution 
aziz returned to the hotel lobby late in the evening to announce 
that a kuwaitiegyptian compromise solution was being submitted to 
the summit for approval at a late night session 
he gave no details of the compromise but said the syrians 
continued to block every compromise suggested on lebanon 
unless there is a lastminute change he said i think the 
situation is going to deteriorate very badly 
the summit had been delayed from closing wednesday by the 
quarrel over lebanon 
syria stressing its geographic proximity and historic links to 
lebanon claimed its withdrawal would leave a security vacuum 
facing israel and fuel the 14year civil war syrian troops have 
been deployed there since 1976 under an an arab league peacekeeping 
mandate 
iraqi president saddam hussein argued at a latenight closed 
summit session wednesday that syria no longer is a neutral mediator 
in lebanon because its troops are fighting alongside moslems 
conference sources said saddam also accused syria of introducing 
a new complication by allowing iranian revolutionary guards into 
lebanon 
the sources said most arab countries agree on the need to 
curtail if not end syrias monopoly in lebanese affairs 
king hussein of jordan suggested compromising with a joint arab 
peace force but said syria must have a role 
it is high time for the arabs to lift the heavy burden that 
syria and its forces in lebanon have had to carry alone he 
said but a solution would come only through a comprehensive arab 
effort in which syria would have its role alongside its arab 
brethren 
but only jordan openly has expressed willingness to send troops 
to lebanon the sources said on condition of anonymity jordans 
delegation made available the text of husseins speech 
he backed iraqi demands that iranian forces should be withdrawn 
about 2000 iranian revolutionary guards deployed in lebanon in 
1982 ostensibly to help fight the invading israeli army it was 
not clear if hussein was suggesting that more iranians lately have 
entered lebanon 
the jordanian leader also called for israels withdrawal from 
its selfdesignated security zone in south lebanon carved out 
after the 19821985 invasion and suggested the un security 
council mediate 
the lebanon crisis and palestinian issue have dominated a 
conference convened primarily to reinstate egypt in the arab league 
after 10 years of ostracism for signing peace with israel 
conference sources said syria has voiced reservations over 
palestine liberation organization chairman yasser arafats peace 
moves including his recognition of israel 
but the sources said the syrians would not block a resolution 
backing arafat because they already are too isolated on the lebanon 
issue

two mormon missionaries killed in bolivia 
were part of a long tradition that sends thousands of young mormons 
into the far corners of the world to share their faith 
since the church of jesus christ of latterday saints was 
founded in 1830 its members have been taught that the task of 
reaping converts was a high and holy calling more important than 
school career or courtship 
todd ray wilson and jeffrey brent ball shot to death on their 
way home in la paz late wednesday were products of a missionary 
zeal that has made mormonism one of the worlds fastest growing 
religions 
the radical zarate willka armed liberation front claimed 
responsibility shortly after the shootings it is the same group 
that last summer tried to kill former secretary of state george 
shultz when he was visiting la paz 
ball 20 of wanship utah left college and a girlfriend to 
become a missionary 
wilson 20 of wellington utah also forsook his studies and 
worked at a restaurant to finance two years of missionary service 
he too had a girlfriend 
balls older sister is serving a mission in guatemala and in 
both families brothers of the victims also are preparing for 
missionary service 
among mormons such sacrifices are not uncommon worldwide the 
faith is served by about 36000 volunteer missionaries who work 
without salary most either pay their own way or are supported by 
their families or local congregations 
each year they bring about 200000 converts to the 66 
millionmember church 
all young men are urged to serve missions before marriage or 
completing college in recent years the church increasingly has 
urged older couples and single young women to join the ranks 
its a scriptural mandate and early presidents of the church 
and church leaders down through the years have emphasized that 
mandate said church spokesman don lefevre 
the faiths founder joseph smith taught that all other 
religions were false and told his followers to carry his message to 
every nation kindred tongue and people 
proselytizing even reaches beyond the grave mormons conduct 
proxy baptisms for nonmormon ancestors in the hope they will 
accept the faith in the hereafter 
john jaussi former bishop of the wanship congregation said 
that typically about five people from the mostly mormon community 
of 250 are serving missions at any given time 
currently wanship has a missionary in london and three just 
returned from argentina north carolina and texas he said 
the average mission costs about 10000 so its quite a 
sacrifice financially but its a sacrifice thats well worth it 
families are quite happy to see their sons go out he said 
on thursday a new group of missionaries arrived at the churchs 
missionary training center at brigham young university to study 
doctrine and learn foreign languages before departing for their 
assignments 
ed pinegar the centers director declined to discuss the 
shootings in bolivia he said through his secretary that the 
trainees had not been informed of the tragedy but would be told 
later 
during any given week about 1500 missionaries are at the 
center said lefevre

when the new soviet parliament opened thursday 
the free debate that characterized the session took a little 
getting used to 
vitaly korotich editor of the avantgarde weekly ogonyok 
compared the session to dancing lessons for legless people 
we dont really know how to move in conditions of democracy 
he said 
at the start of the proceedings the only leader on the stage 
was a towering statue of soviet founder and veritable communist 
saint vladimir lenin 
mikhail s gorbachev was just another portly balding party man 
in the front row until he was elected temporary chairman and left 
his fellow deputies to take charge of the congress under lenins 
watchful gaze 
then gorbachev became puppetmaster pulling strings to set the 
session dancing to his desires 
dozens of deputies strode decisively to the one microphone in 
the well to argue procedural points or offer frank criticism and 
probing questions of gorbachev and his government their colleagues 
in the kremlins starkly modern glassandgranite palace of 
congresses laughed booed glowered and listened avidly an abrupt 
contrast to the bored perusing of pravda typical in the old 
parliament 
defeat did not discourage the vanquished so thrilled were they 
to hear the debate 
weve never had anything like this said alexander n kraiko 
of moscow undeterred by his sides defeat in an attempt to hear 
the candidates before voting on them 
the vote on that proposal was overwhelming with only 379 of the 
2250 deputies voting on kraikos side but it was only last 
october that the old soviet parliament experienced its first no 
votes when 13 brave souls raised their hands to oppose a law on 
using paramilitary troops against demonstrators at the time 
colleagues gasped smirked and pointed at the handful making a 
historic break with decades of unanimity 
debates are going on said deputy dmitri s likhachev on 
thursday thats democracy 
gorbachev displayed a surprising mastery of parliamentary 
trickery he ignored amendments he didnt like ordering votes on 
the original proposals instead he gave early speakers five 
minutes later ones only 30 seconds 
vitas tomkus a lithuanian delegate observed that when 
gorbachev agreed with a suggestion he genially asked for the 
halls opinion 
he carries on like a god permitting others to speak tomkus 
said with reluctant admiration for the leaders skill hes like 
a great actor attuned to the hall 
outside the vast auditorium reporters who in the past were 
hemmed into a distant balcony and only occasionally released for 
brief meetings with chosen delegates were stunned to find 
themselves wandering about the lobby surrounded by hundreds of 
deputies some journalists even bumped into members of the ruling 
politburo who are almost never seen in public 
in a hallway on the ground floor of the auditorium masses of 
chainsmokers reduced visibility to about 10 yards but there was 
no indication of politicking or caucusing in the room it was 
strictly for smoking 
at the lunch break tomkus and several of his fellow lithuanian 
deputies relaxed in the kremlin sunshine cracking strained jokes 
about the impossibility of winning approval for their radical 
proposals for baltic sovereignty they looked thoroughly out of 
place among deputies generally 25 years their senior 
look tomkus joked pointing at some passing deputies 
sporting distinctive felt caps that marked them as representatives 
of conservative central asia there are some more who wont vote 
for us

a military court acquitted four soldiers of 
manslaughter thursday in the beating death of a palestinian because 
medical evidence indicated he died of blows administered later by 
other soldiers 
all four were found guilty of brutality and will be sentenced 
june 15 
arab hospital officials said israeli soldiers in the occupied 
gaza strip shot and killed an 18yearold palestinian and wounded 
at least 35 people on thursday including a 6yearold boy two 
palestinians were reported wounded in the west bank 
at least 498 palestinans have been killed in the uprising 
against israeli occupation that began more than 17 months ago 
twentytwo israelis have been slain 
the military court decided the case of four soldiers accused of 
beating 42yearold hani shami to death aug 22 after arresting him 
during a roundup at the jabaliya refugee camp in gaza 
jabaliya is a squalid camp of 60000 palestinians just north of 
gaza city the first riots of the uprising occurred there on dec 
8 1987 and it is considered one of the gaza strips most militant 
areas 
col emanuel gross the presiding judge said the soldiers beat 
shami indiscriminately in his home for about 15 minutes with rifle 
butts and a broomstick he said one defendant jumped from a bed 
onto the victims stomach 
medical evidence showed however that shami died of a further 
beating by other soldiers after he was taken to an army base the 
judge said adding that the investigation was so poor that those 
who dealt the fatal blows probably could not be identified or 
disciplined 
the trial was seen as a test of the armys willingness to punish 
soldiers for brutality the united states has criticized israel for 
either not bringing violators to trial or being too lenient with 
penalties 
beatings became widespread after defense minister yitzhak rabin 
authorized soldiers in january 1988 to beat palestinian rioters 
commanders said many soldiers initially felt they were required to 
break bones 
gross said officers in jabaliya had ordered soldiers to beat 
palestinians in detention in violation of written army orders he 
said the orders issued in jabaliya were manifestly illegal and 
the defendants should have refused to obey 
the beating of someone who disturbs order for the purpose of 
deterrence is not a military need it is punishment the judge 
said 
army spokesmen refused comment on whether charges would be filed 
against officers in jabaliya who issued illegal orders 
military officials who testified at the trial acknowledged that 
the orders on beating were ambiguous 
when asked when beatings were permitted lt gen dan shomron 
the chief of staff testified in march you are asking me about 
gray areas soldiers are told to use their own judgment how 
severe a situation is and how much force is necessary 
gross said the army should issue clear written orders on the use 
of force 
we must guard the rule of law which is the basis for our 
values as a civilized nation he declared the law must not be 
harmed despite the great distress faced by soldiers as they 
perform their duties 
the defendants 1st sgt yitzhak adler and yitzhak kibbudi 
ariyeh luchato and pvt ron hakhel all privates could be given 
up to three years in prison each for brutality for manslaughter 
the maximum sentence is 20 years 
on thursday soldiers in jabaliya opened fire on stonethrowers 
fatally wounding khaled mohammed atawneh 18 the arab hospital 
officials said 
trouble started in the camp when soldiers tried to arrest a 
palestinian in his home and rumors spread that soldiers would 
demolish the building 
in other developments thursday hundreds of jewish settlers from 
kiryat arba near hebron in the west bank rioted after a firebomb 
attack on an israeli car there were no injuries in the attack 
israel radio said the settlers opened fire indiscriminately but 
army radio said they were blocked by the army and could not reach 
hebron the second largest west bank city no casualties were 
reported 
the army released ghassan khattib a palestinian university 
lecturer detained may 15 a day before he was to meet with visiting 
us envoy dennis ross his release came following appeals from 
peace now an israeli leftwing movement 
also thursday troops demolished two houses and sealed two other 
houses belonging to four suspected stonethrowers and rioters in 
the village of elazariya near jerusalem the army said

fouryearolds who were able to wait the 
longest in preschool for rewards of candy treats tend later in 
life to accomplish more to be more intelligent and to have higher 
scores on college entrance exams researchers said thursday 
thats the finding of three columbia university researchers who 
followed up on experiments conducted in the 1970s among students at 
a stanford university preschool the study is to be published 
friday in the journal science 
columbia researchers walter mischel yuichi shoda and monica l 
rodriguez reported in the study that children who tend to prefer 
delayed rewards tend to be more intelligent more likely to 
resist temptation to have greater social responsibility and higher 
achievement strivings 
and when those children later took scholastic aptitude tests for 
college the coauthors said the patience they demonstrated in 
preschool is reflected in higher scores and better academic 
performance 
the early studies at stanford involved teaching preschoolers a 
game in which they were shown a pair of treats of different value 
prior to being left alone in a room the first treat for instance 
could be one marshmallow and the more valuable treat could be two 
marshmallows 
each child was told that they could receive the more valuable 
treat by waiting until the experimenter returned to the room 
the wait could be ended at any time by ringing a bell but this 
would result in the least valuable of the treats in effect the 
rule was the longer they waited the more they got 
after a child was left alone the researchers recorded the 
length of the delay and observed the child without being seen 
typically the child was left alone for about 15 minutes unless 
the child ended the wait himself 
a recent followup said the researchers showed that those 
who had waited longer in this situation at 4 years of age were 
described more than 10 years later by their parents as adolescents 
who were more academically and socially competent than their peers 
and more able to cope with frustration and resist temptation 
at least 35 of the children tested in the 1970s in one variation 
of the experiment have since taken sat examinations for college 
admission and the researchers said their verbal and 
quantititative sat scores were significantly related to seconds of 
preschool delay time 
the more seconds that a child was able to wait while a 
preschooler the study said the higher the child later scored on 
the sat tests 
since there was only a small sample in the group that has taken 
sat exams the columbia researchers said that the finding 
dictates special caution they said more research is needed to 
establish the relationship between learning at an early age to 
delay gratification and the later effects in life 
science which published the study is a the journal of the 
american association for the advancement of science

the nuclear regulatory commission said it will 
issue a lowpower test license for the seabrook nh nuclear 
reactor friday after a federal appeals court rejected a lastgasp 
plea by opponents 
the us circuit court of appeals in a ruling issued late 
thursday afternoon refused to impose an emergency stay on 
lowpower tests at seabrook a 6 billion plant that is already a 
decade behind schedule and billions over budget 
the court order had been sought by massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis and other opponents who have tried for three years to block 
lowpower testing 
in boston dukakis attacked the planned lowpower licensing 
saying there is no acceptable plan to evacuate nearby residents in 
case of an accident nor is there any evidence that such a plan 
can even be produced 
the governor and massachusetts attorney general james shannon 
vowed to continue the fight against a fullpower commercial 
operating license were not out this by a long shot said 
shannon 
nrc chairman lando w zech jr said a commercial license could 
come as soon as this fall but shannon predicted we have a long 
fight ahead of us with a web of regulatory and court appeals 
still to come 
in a onepage order the appeals court said petitions have 
failed to demonstrate the requisite irreparable injury and 
likelihood of success on the merits to warrant the preliminary 
relief sought 
nrc spokesman frank ingram said the license would be issued 
friday morning 
seabrook officials said they would start preparations for atomic 
testing immediately after receiving commission authorization and 
begin the plants first nuclear tests within 10 days 
lowpower testing which would allow the reactor to operate at 5 
percent capacity would be the biggest milestone in the checkered 
20year history of seabrook 
the 1150megawatt reactor on the southern new hampshire coast 
has been set back 10 years by protests politics regulatory 
obstacles and financial crises that have increased the projects 
cost tenfold and left the lead owner seeking bankruptcy protection 
energy secretary james d watkins this week jumped into the 
fray saying the plant is badly needed to meet new englands 
increasing energy needs and avoid brownouts and other regional 
energy emergencies 
an elated edward brown president of seabrook operator new 
hampshire yankee said we will successfully complete lowpower 
testing we will go into commericial operation and we will produce 
safe efficient clean electricity electricity that will supply 
more than 1 million new england homes and businesses 
seabrook station is the safest power plant thats ever been 
built and we are staffed with a team of operators and engineers 
that i think are unsurpassed anywhwere in the world brown said 
at a seabrook news conference 
the lowpower license became the rallying point for seabrook 
opponents many of whom have been trying to kill the plant for two 
decades 
seabrooks threeyear quest for a lowpower license was first 
halted in 1986 when massachusetts gov michael s dukakis in the 
wake of the chernobyl accident in the soviet union refused to 
cooperate with evacuation planning for the six northeast 
massachusetts towns near the plant 
dukakis says it is impossible to quickly evacuate the coastal 
area especially when beach goers swell the areas summer 
population 
a lowpower license was set back again last year when seabrooks 
lead owner public service company of new hampshire filed for 
federal bankruptcy protection 
the nrc approved the license after seabrook officials set up a 
721 million fund to cover the estimated added costs of 
mothballing the plant if it undergoes lowpower testing but never 
operates commercially but the commissioners in a 40 ruling last 
thursday said it would delay issuance of the license for one week 
to give the court time to rule on the stay petition

a chorus line of shufflestepping tap 
dancers hoofed it across the golden gate bridge on thursday 
celebrating national tap dance day on the birthday of legendary 
tapper bill bojangles robinson 
the wind and salty air threatened to blow off their hats as 
about 30 dancers shimshamshimmied across the span dodging 
befuddled joggers and bicyclists 
i dont care if im overweight and pushing 40 i feel like a 
star said tap dancer debby keleher thrusting her arms out like 
ethel merman 
the bart escalator mechanic who practices on broken subway 
escalators in her cowgirl costume passed a goldsequined torch 
of tap during the singlefile relay watched by wideeyed drivers 
against a backdrop of san francisco skyscrapers and a vast 
expanse of water below the tappers made their way from marin to 
the san francisco side where they received a city hall proclamation 
in washington rep john conyers dmich got a resolution 
approved by the house declaring thursday national tap dance day 
conyers who admitted being a frustrated tap dancer soon to begin 
lessons was playing host to celebrations in the nations capital 
by the tap america project 
tap dancing is widely recognized as americas only original 
form of dance yet for years it has been in danger of becoming a 
lost art conyers said in a telephone interview 
he said bojangles former dance partner 65yearold lloyd 
story tried to tap on the house floor but was barred by the 
parliamentarian who said it violated rules against demonstrations 
on the bridge english tourist joan burke let out a whoop when 
the dancers assembled 
oh great we saw 42nd street the musical in london yes 
its super this is a bonus burke said as her husband paul 
snapped pictures of dancers from the group rosie radiator and the 
san francisco supertappers 
the troupe led by rosie in her red flared skirt white tuxedo 
vest and sailor hat is listed in the guinness book of world 
records for longest tap dance for its 73mile performance in 1987 
seven tap dancers with sandwich boards were barred from crossing 
the span by officials who feared written words would distract 
commuters on the sixlane bridge 
but everything was copacetic as bojangles used to say for an 
aerobitapper with metal taps on her running shoes and a 
tapping clown who stomped their way across 
tap a rhythmic art that blends african dance with the irish jig 
and lively english clog originated among black dancers performing 
on street corners and in saloons 
unlike ballet dancers tap dancers hold their body limp like a 
rag doll and use the natural movements to belt out rhythms with 
their feet 
tap greats such as bill bojangles robinson who died in 
1949 and howard sandman sims popularized the dance in musical 
extravaganzas of the 1930s and 40s 
there is a happiness there when i tap dance said hoofer 
marilyn winston there are very few ways that comes out of my 
body its a natural happiness that comes out of me i have to tap 
to live

a canadian woman conspired with dozens of 
computer hackers across the united states some as young as 14 in 
a scheme to steal as much as 15 million in goods services and 
cash authorities said thursday 
leslie lynn doucette 35 was charged with conspiring to steal 
telephone and computer service the us attorneys office said 
she was charged with trafficking in illegal credit cards and 
telephone callingcard numbers on corporate and government 
voicemail computers 
ms doucette arrested wednesday in chicago is from toronto 
and was convicted in canada in 1987 of telecommunications fraud 
said assistant us attorney bill cook 
authorities believe her operation involved at least 50 people in 
several states cook said 
federal agents have questioned pairs of teenagers in columbus 
ohio sterling heights mich and boston and they impounded the 
computer equipment of a 15yearold in marietta ga authorities 
said search warrants also were issued in los angeles cook said 
us magistrate joan lefkow ordered ms doucette whose two 
children live with her held without bond at least temporarily 
cook said 
earlier in the fourmonth investigation she called the 
attorney generals office in arizona and indicated they werent 
going to be able to locate her cook said 
if convicted ms doucette faces up to 10 years in prison for 
illegal use of computeraccess devices 5 years for wire fraud and 
5 years for conspiracy cook said 
in sterling heights mich secret service agents questioned two 
eighthgraders said to have admitted belonging to the hacking 
network the 14yearold boys got hooked because of their 
fascination with the medium said james huse of the secret 
services detroit office 
one of the boys ran up a 3800 phone bill for april because he 
mistakenly thought he was making free longdistance calls huse 
said 
authorities estimated the value of goods and services obtained 
illegally by the network to be between 200000 and 15 million 
huse said investigators still had to sort through evidence to find 
out what the hackers ordered with other peoples credit cards and 
how much revenue longdistance companies lost 
court documents in chicago charged that ms doucette using the 
codename kyrie infiltrated electronic mailboxes in which 
businesses store and exchange information and messages 
the hackers communicated with each other through companies 
private mailboxes to avoid the scrutiny police have been giving to 
public bulletin boards the forums where computer users 
normally share information authorities said 
the hackers used their computers to program their telephones to 
keep dialing until they got into an electronic mailbox prosecutors 
said there they found codes that gave them access to other 
computers or telephone services credit card numbers and other data 
ms doucette for example obtained at least 1000 in money 
orders purchased from western union with credit cards whose numbers 
she passed on to other hackers cook said 
home box office and rca telephone system sales also suffered 
losses huse said

house speaker jim wright has all but decided 
to resign his leadership post friends said thursday but he 
remained torn over details of his leaving and insisted he had 
done no serious wrong despite numerous ethics allegations 
congressional sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
plans were being made for wright to make a farewell address to the 
house on wednesday 
house majority leader tom foley of washington appeared to be the 
oddson favorite to replace him in the top post in the house 
foley at a news conference in seattle said he knew of no plans 
by wright to resign but he said wright expressed a desire to state 
his case next week or shortly afterward 
wright first elected to congress 34 years ago remained in his 
capitol office during the day from there he issued a statement 
proclaiming there would be no deal in which he would quit his 
post in exchange for dismissal of some of the ethics committee 
charges 
but his departure seemed ever more likely 
there are plans for wednesday but we dont know if hell do 
it said one friend of the texas democrat hes torn between 
wanting to be heard in an ethics committee hearing and doing 
whats best for himself and the house 
the speaker was said to have been personally hurt by reports on 
wednesday that he had sought to negotiate a plea bargaining 
arrangement with the ethics committee which charged him april 17 
with 69 violations of house rules 
in his statement he said there is no deal now there will be 
no deal in the future i earnestly believe that i have 
committed no serious wrong in the conduct of my official duties or 
of my private affairs 
but it was clear that there had been a flurry of proposals and 
counterproposals between wrights representatives and the ethics 
panel on wednesday those efforts fell short of agreement but some 
on both sides still held out hope that a negotiated settlement 
could be achieved 
rep robert torricelli dnj a member of wrights legal 
defense team who was involved in the talks said he believed a 
consensus was emerging among ethics committee members that charges 
wright improperly accepted gifts from a businessman friend with a 
direct interest in legislation were not well founded 
the other serious charge against wright that he evaded house 
limits on outside income through bulk sales of his book to groups 
to which he had delivered speeches was believed by panel members 
to be on solid ground torricelli said 
wright spokesman mark johnson said the texas democrat planned a 
weekend getaway with his wife betty to an undisclosed location one 
lawmaker close to the talks speculated that wright would spend the 
time writing his final speech 
i think he just wants his day in the well said the source 
referring to the front of the house chamber 
the ethics panel was scheduled to meet again next thursday but 
that session could be rendered moot if wright both stepped down as 
speaker and as associates have reasoned resigned his house seat 
friends of the speaker said he was making his plans independent of 
any action by the ethics committee and was not deterred by the 
collapse of wednesdays talks 
as the planning continued wouldbe successors to wright and 
other house democratic leaders who might move up or out in a 
shakeup could not restrain behindthescenes campaigning 
theres a certain amount of inappropriateness in mounting a 
campaign before the funeral said rep pat williams dmont 
our bizarre system in congress somehow puts the hanging in front 
of the trial and jim wright looks up and its his corpse thats 
swinging he said 
foley publicly dismissed assertions that wright was poised to 
resign but fellow house democrats were already privately assuming 
he would shortly be speaker 
i have no expectations that the speaker is going to resign 
foley said in seattle he repeated his desire to have an 
opportunity to state his case his side of the case to the widest 
possible audience and hes determined to take that opportunity at 
the first time that seems appropriate i assume that will be with 
either next week or shortly thereafter 
rep richard gephardt dmo was being urged strongly by 
supporters to run to replace foley as majority leader the no 2 
position it was unclear whether the thirdranking democrat in the 
house majority whip tony coelho of california would seek to move 
up or would be prevented from doing so by separate ethics questions 
that have arisen over his business dealings 
contenders also were lining up for the no 3 whips spot 
including rep david bonior dmich the current chief deputy 
whip and democratic caucus chairman rep william h gray iii dpa 
congressional sources confirmed that wednesdays talks 
including offers by wrights lawyers for him to resign his 
leadership post in return for dropping some of the most serious 
charges had fallen apart 
one lawmaker close to the discussions said there was still a 
willingness on the part of ethics committee members democrats and 
republicans alike to craft a negotiated settlement 
however rep john t myers of indiana the ethics committees 
senior republican said any sort of pleabargaining arrangement 
would be unprecedented and would set a nightmarish example for the 
future 
there have been members who have quit rather than face 
charges but we have no control over that myers said but 
where we have control we say well drop this if youll do that 
i dont really think the house of representatives should do 
this 
the effort was complicated by publicity about the dealing said 
one legislator who commented only on condition he not be named he 
said committee chairman julian dixon dcalif doesnt want to 
be perceived as asking for a negotiated settlement and the speaker 
doesnt either

prime minister charles haugheys minority 
government elected 28 months ago by the narrowest margin possible 
on thursday called for a general election june 15 in a bid to 
capitalize on irelands economic revival and gain a majority 
haughey rose in the dail or parliament and in a oneline 
statement said he would ask president patrick hillery to formally 
dissolve the 166seat legislature 
the election is timed to coincide with elections to the 
12nation european parliament 
haughey is midway through a maximum fiveyear term his fiscal 
austerity has brought a turnaround from harsh recession reflected 
in a low inflation rate of 33 percent a trade surplus and a 
moderate economic growth rate 
but with interest rates creeping up this month to 925 percent 
and signs inflation may rise haughey wants to try for an outright 
parliamentary majority before the economic situation deteriorates 
in february 1987 haughey and his fianna fail party failed to 
win a majority in the dail for the second time he won power on the 
vote of a lone leftwing maverick toppling the 198287 coalition 
government of garret fitzgerald 
fianna fail is riding high in opinion polls and critics say 
opposition parties led by the main opposition fine gael under its 
new leader alan dukes are in disarray and unable to offer a 
credible alternative 
an opinion poll published in the sunday independent newspaper on 
may 7 gave fianna fail a 50 percent approval rating against 28 
percent for the opposition it said haugheys personal approval has 
climbed to a 54percent peak 
critics complain that the improvements in this island republic 
of 34 million people are not filtering through to the poor and the 
young unemployment remains at 179 percent and emigration at an 
estimated 32000 a year is at its highest level since the 1950s

as jacqueline onassis and president kennedys two 
children looked on thursday sen edward m kennedy announced the 
creation of an award honoring political courage in public officials 
the john f kennedy profile in courage award was created to 
honor the slain president and promote individualism among the 
nations public officials 
too often contemporary elected officials are captives of 
popular opinion and public opinion polls kennedy told a news 
conference at the john f kennedy library theyre unwilling to 
resist partisan or regional pressures or offend powerful interest 
groups 
the name of the 40000 award is based on john kennedys book 
profiles in courage which won the pulitzer prize in 1957 
ever since then he has been closely linked in the public mind 
with that idea said kennedy dmass we feel that the concept 
of political courage captures the essence of president kennedys 
enduring appeal his vision of public service and the continuing 
challenge of elective office 
after kennedys remarks reporters called on mrs onassis 
wearing a hot pink jacket and a black miniskirt to speak but she 
touched her son johns shoulder saying hell speak for the 
family 
the younger kennedy spoke briefly saying the award means a 
great deal hopefully it will be administered well in years to 
come 
his sister caroline kennedy schlossberg also attended the news 
conference 
the award will be presented each year to those in public life 
who demonstrate a principled stand for what they believe is right 
on fundamental issues of the day even though they are risking 
their careers and the wrath of their constituents 
award recipients will be named on john kennedys birthday may 
29 according to the kennedy family the president who was 
assassinated in dallas in 1963 would have been 72 years old this 
memorial day 
the first award will be presented next year 
our family is attempting to shift the tributes to president 
kennedy from the date of his assassination in november to the date 
of his birth in may sen kennedy said we want to remember his 
life not relive his death

aids patients with a form of pneumonia commonly 
fatal to them are more than three times as likely to survive in 
hospitals experienced in treating aids sufferers than in other 
hospitals a study suggests 
the findings support the belief that regional centers are needed 
to provide the best care for people with the aids virus said 
authors of the study published in fridays journal of the american 
medical association 
the study involved 257 aids patients with the infection called 
pneumocystis carinii pneumonia it found that the inhospital death 
rate was only 12 percent at experienced hospitals compared with 33 
percent at hospitals less familiar with aids 
after making statistical adjustments to correct for differences 
in severity of illness the inhospital death rate for aids 
patients with the pneumonia was about 36 times higher than in less 
experienced hospitals the study said 
researchers said they studied patients with the pneumonia 
because it is a common complication of aids often treated 
successfully but frequently leading to death 
hospitals considered experienced in the study were those that 
discharged at least 30 patients with aidsrelated medical problems 
for every 10000 patients discharged overall 
all patients studied were at 15 california hospitals 
researchers said 
it is likely that the technology for fighting aids is being 
developed unevenly among the nations hospitals and that 
hospitals with low aids familiarity are at a marked disadvantage in 
the treatment of patients with aids said the researchers led by 
dr charles l bennett of the randuniversity of california at los 
angeles center for health policy study and the ucla school of 
medicine 
creating regional aids centers soon would be a tough job 
according to an accompanying jama editorial in which dr deborah j 
cotton of beth israel hospital in boston said the nations health 
care system is already in crisis 
problems would include how to meet the patients needs for 
longterm care and community services outside the centers and the 
possibility that special hospitals might increase the isolation 
and stigmatization experienced by patients with aids 
nonetheless the creation of such centers should be considered 
urgently as part of alongterm planning strategies she wrote 
as aids therapy becomes more complex the ability of many 
acutecare hospitals to provide such therapy will become 
increasingly difficult

the new parliament on thursday reaffirmed its 
predecessors choice of mikhail gorbachev as president in a session 
marked by unprecedented debate and tough questioning of a soviet 
leader 
gorbachev won more than 95 percent of the vote in uncontested 
balloting at the opening session of the congress of peoples 
deputies the first competitively chosen soviet parliament 
maverick communist boris n yeltsin withdrew his name before the 
vote and the new parliament rejected a member who tried to 
nominate himself 
although opponents of the established leadership were a distinct 
minority the combative atmosphere contrasted sharply with that of 
previous soviet parliaments that rubberstampedthe actions of the 
kremlin leadership 
gorbachev received 2123 of the 2210 votes cast yuri a 
osipyan chairman of the commission that counted the ballots 
announced during the nationally televised proceedings eightyseven 
deputies voted against the communist party chief osipyan said and 
11 abstained 
gorbachev who has led the soviet union since 1985 had been 
elected president on oct 1 by the congress predecessor the 
supreme soviet he succeeded andrei a gromyko in what was then a 
largely ceremonial post 
in the new governmental structure the fiveyear presidency is 
to be invested with greater powers including the chairmanship of 
the defense council and the right to propose laws and negotiate 
with foreign powers 
in a clear reference to past soviet dictatorships gorbachev 
vowed to pursue the line of democracy until the very end so that 
what has happened in this country will never again be repeated 
communist party ideology chief vadim a medvedev told reporters 
the partys victory in nationwide balloting in march entitled it to 
pick its leader as president 
the party went through the election process it won support 
therefore the socalled cabinet will be formed from its leaders 
medvedev said 
one deputy sought to nominate yeltsin to run against gorbachev 
for president and a littleknown engineer from leningrad offered 
himself as a sacrifice alternative to the soviet leader 
im no idiot and i understand perfectly well that i have no 
chances in a struggle with mikhail sergeyevich gorbachev said 
alexander obolensky the engineer but i want there to be a 
precedent of an alternative in elections in our history 
human rights activist andrei d sakharov who was voted down 
when he tried to require a stateoftheunion report from gorbachev 
before the election said he would not take part in the secret 
ballot 
we cant let these elections just be a formality the 1975 
nobel peace prize winner said sakharov was one of four deputies 
who abstained when the body voted to place gorbachevs name on the 
ballot no one voted against 
estonian activist marju lauristin offered gorbachev her vote on 
condition he answer some tough questions first 
she said she wanted to know who in the ruling politburo knew 
about plans to use troops to break up a proindependence 
demonstration in soviet georgia last month and how soon gorbachev 
learned of them twenty people died in the unrest 
there have been mistakes major oversights gorbachev said 
and some of them didnt have to happen im suffering because of 
them too 
we understand with our brains that its necessary to change 
he said but the system doesnt let us 
gorbachev said he had intended to send foreign minister eduard 
a shevardnadze a georgian to tbilisi before the demonstration 
but was advised the situation was under control 
others demanded explanations for the privileges enjoyed by 
soviet leaders and of a decree banning statements that discredit 
authorities some questioned whether he should serve as both 
communist party chief and head of state 
yeltsin whose populist campaign garnered 90 percent of the vote 
in citywide elections in moscow took himself out of the running 
after being nominated by a deputy from his native sverdlovsk region 
in the urals 
yeltsin noted that as a member of the partys central committee 
he was bound by its decision to support gorbachev only 14 deputies 
opposed a motion not to put his name on the ballot 
with the exception of the secret ballot the entire session was 
televised live offering soviets a rare look at the workings of 
their government still the soviets lack of experience with 
parliamentary democracy was apparent 
gorbachev as presiding officer arbitrarily called for votes on 
some procedural issues while ignoring others only a few deputies 
objected 
there was fierce debate over procedural issues but the agenda 
hammered out in advance by gorbachev and a few hundred deputies in 
a private caucus wednesday was adopted by a lopsided margin 
sakharov and economist gavril popov led the fight against the 
establishment 
sakharov once the nations most famed dissident and now a 
member of the parliament praised gorbachev 
i dont see another person who could lead the country at this 
time said the winner of the 1975 nobel peace prize but he added 
gorbachev should first be required to give an account of the 
mistakes and achievements of his reform program 
gorbachev a giant statue of vladimir i lenin at his back 
frequently intervened in the debate amid shouts from the floor 
guiding and controlling the assembly in the vast auditorium of the 
kremlins marbleandglass palace of congresses 
at least 80 percent of the deputies are communist party members 
but the presence of a small band of reformers including 
grassroots activists from the three tiny baltic republics assured 
that the congress will differ from the docile parliaments of the 
past 
deputies squabbled over every point of the agenda 
just a moment i havent given you the floor gorbachev told 
one deputy who walked to the podium and began to speak ill give 
you the floor but you have to ask for it the member was then 
permitted to speak

us rep donald lukens acknowledged 
having sex with a girl he knew was a minor a private investigator 
testified thursday at a trial at which the congressman had no 
defense witnesses 
he admitted that he did have sexual intercourse with rosie 
coffman said jd caudill the final witness called by 
prosecutors 
lukens attorney thomas tyack who called no witnesses said the 
defense was strapped by judge ronald soloves refusal to allow him 
to bring up ms coffmans juvenile delinquency and school records 
it puts us in the position of this man being tried in a 
vacuum tyack said 
lukens a 58yearold conservative republican is being tried on 
a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor 
the franklin county domestic relations court jury is expected to 
get the case friday if convicted lukens could be sentenced to 180 
days in jail and a 1000 fine 
assistant prosecutor rita mangini said she had proved that ms 
coffman engaged in prostitution and consumed alcohol both elements 
of unruliness and delinquency as a result of lukens actions 
i would submit under these facts that mr lukens is an immoral 
person she said 
caudill a former dayton police officer hired by lukens former 
attorney said the congressman admitted to the sexual encounter 
when he came to caudills office for a polygraph examination jan 
30 
caudill testified that lukens who is divorced told him that 
when the congressman and ms coffman had sex at his apartment on 
nov 6 she told him she would turn 18 the next day 
ms coffman who actually was to turn 17 on wednesday testified 
that she had lied to lukens by telling him she was 18 or 19 but 
she said she also gave him her real birthdate nov 7 1971 
earlier thursday the jury heard a taped telephone conversation 
in which lukens unaware that the fbi and police were recording the 
call denied to anna coffman rosies mother that he had sex with 
the girl 
in the tape lukens told anna coffman that her daughter had been 
calling him and asked that she stop it mrs coffman said on the 
tape that her daughter had confessed to her that she had sex with 
lukens on nov 6 the previous sunday 
she was there with mercedes what mercedes and i did was 
private your daughter had nothing to do with it lukens replied 
on the tape mercedes was the name used by rosie coffmans friend 
michelle foster then 19 who had invited ms coffman to lukens 
apartment that night 
but lukens in the phone call also asked anna coffman whether she 
was still interested in the job mrs coffman has testified 
lukens earlier that day met her at a restaurant and tried to bribe 
her with an offer to help her find a government job lukens claims 
she was trying to extort money from him in exchange for her silence 
reporter ted hart of wsyxtv in columbus who arranged to 
secretly videotape the meeting between anna coffman and lukens at 
the restaurant acknowledged the station paid for anna and rosie 
coffmans twonight stay at a hotel beginning feb 22 the day 
lukens was indicted 
he denied that the station paid the coffmans any money before 
that for their story anna coffman was first interviewed in 
november after she called wsyx for help 
rosie coffman had testified wednesday that lukens made her wear 
a black robe to have sex with him and made racial slurs during the 
evening lukens is white ms coffman is black 
the outcome of the case will not directly affect lukens 
standing in the house to which he was elected in 1986 after 
serving two terms in the 1960s however he could be subject to 
disciplinary action by the ethics committee

the soviet union has informed norway that a 
submarine that sank in the norwegian sea on april 7 was powered by 
conventional watercooled reactors with lowenriched uranium cores 
officials said thursday 
officials had thought that the komsomolets was powered by more 
dangerous liquidmetalcooled reactors with highenriched uranium 
cores fortytwo soviet crewmen died in the accident 
foreign ministry spokeswoman sigrid romundset said the soviet 
foreign ministry gave the information in a letter delivered to the 
norwegian embassy in moscow on wednesday 
the soviet reply was surprising but reassuring it will now be 
studied by experts to make sure there are no misunderstandings 
concerning the reactor types said knut gussgard of norways 
nuclear inspection agency which had asked the soviets for 
information on the reactors 
some of our questions still remain unanswered among them the 
exact reactor size and the quantity of radioactive material in the 
cores he said 
johan baarli director of the norwegian national institute of 
radiation protection said earlier that tests last month showed 
that the submarines reactors and weapons have withstood tremendous 
water pressure water samples collected near the sunken sub showed 
no radiation that could be attributed to the vessel the institute 
said

a prisoner was killed and 48 others were 
reported injured thursday after some of the worst violence at 
folsom prison in several years erupted in an exercise yard 
officials said 
guards fired 10 shots to break up the melee wounding three 
prisoners said prison spokeswoman lt cammy voss 
the three were hospitalized as were two convicts who were 
stabbed voss said 
the fight appeared to have been racially motivated voss said 
mostly black and hispanic prisoners and a couple of white prisoners 
were involved 
authorities dont believe the fight was gangrelated she said 
we dont know why it erupted there was no buildup that led up to 
this 
officers locked all 7000 inmates at the maximumsecurity prison 
20 miles east of sacramento into their cells 
the slain inmate who was black was identified as michael 
coleman 29 he arrived at the prison april 20 to serve a fouryear 
term for a los angeles county armed robbery 
fortythree inmates were treated at the prison infirmary for 
minor stab wounds scrapes and cuts said prison spokesman dl 
porter 
however not all the injuries were believed to have been 
suffered in the fight said state department of corrections 
spokesman tipton kindel 
guards stripsearched the approximately 300 men who were in the 
yard during the fight kindel said officers were required to list 
all injuries not previously reported to authorities 
some of the injuries they said they knew were at least a day 
old he said but by the procedures they had to write those 
down 
voss said the fight was the worst violence at a new wing of the 
prison that opened in 1986 and perhaps the worst at the entire 
prison since racial violence involving mainly hispanic and black 
prison gang members led to an extended lockdown seven years ago

japan lashed out at the united states friday for 
targeting japanese trade barriers under a us trade law that could 
lead to stiff tariffs on japanese exports to its biggest market 
foreign minister sousuke uno called the action extremely 
regrettable 
he said it was unfair because the united states has 
unilaterally made such a decision on the trade practices of other 
countries including japan despite the fact that the us itself 
maintains import restrictive measures and practices to a 
considerable degree 
the foreign minister urged the united states to reduce its 
huge budget deficit he said the socalled super 301 list 
of unfair trade practices was an attempt to divert attention from 
the major cause of the trade imbalance between the two countries 
and to deny us responsibility for faltering economic policies 
as a result of many marketopening measures which have been 
taken to date the japanese market has now become a widely open 
market uno said none of the identified priority practices 
can be considered to constitute trade barriers 
the bush administration announced thursday it had named trade 
barriers in japan brazil and india under its massive trade law 
enacted last year us trade representative carla hills said the 
administration will immediately begin negotiations with the three 
countries to try to get the barriers removed so that any threatened 
us trade sanctions would be unnecessary 
if the talks are unsuccessful the us government can levy 
tariffs of up to 100 percent against selected imports from an 
offending country 
mrs hills who made the announcement in washington cited japan 
for refusal to buy americanmade satellites and supercomputers as 
well as its barriers on us lumber products 
this framework by which the united states forces us to 
negotiate by selfishly imposing sanctions violates the fundamental 
idea of multilateral trade negotitions under the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade or gatt said hiroshi mitsuzuka 
japans minister of international trade and industry 
we will raise this issue at mutinational meetings mitsuzuka 
added 
our government is ready to talk about the matter at 
international levels including gatt but we would not consider any 
usjapanese bilateral negotiations in the framework of super 
301 said mitsuzuka 
foreign minister uno said japan would prefer to solve trade 
problems between the two nations through quiet talks and joint 
cooperation with the united states 
in washington outgoing japanese ambassador to the united states 
nobuo matsunaga said his government would strongly oppose any 
future sanctions 
in light of the good faith efforts that have been made the 
government of japan and the japanese people are greatly 
disappointed by this onesided decision matsunaga said in a 
statement there may well be some domestic backlash in japan 
which will make the resolution of the various problems even more 
difficult

striking teachers thursday approved by 
acclamation a contract with a 24 percent pay raise over three years 
and more authority for instructors whose walkout crippled education 
for a halfmillion students 
teachers will return to the classroom friday after an 11day 
strike in the nations secondlargest school district 
our children will have their teachers back board of 
education member julie korenstein said after the board approved the 
pact in a 4hour closedoor meeting 
its done as far as were concerned said board member 
warren furutani 
the tally of the boards vote was not known and an official 
public vote was scheduled on june 19 but board member rita walters 
criticized the contract and refused to stand with her six 
colleagues at a news conference 
she said the 600 million salary plan for teachers would drain 
the budget in other areas the union has disputed that any cuts 
would be needed 
teachers union president wayne johnson characterized the 
settlement as historic 
things in the los angeles unified school district as far as 
teachers are concerned have changed for all time a jubilant 
johnson declared minutes before the voice vote by teachers in the 
sports arena 
union members who filled the arena on the strikes 11th day 
still had to fill out ballots to satisfy bylaws but it was 
apparent during an hourlong meeting that virtually all points of 
the contract including yearly 8 percent wage increases were 
enthusiastically accepted 
the board of directors of united teacherslos angeles had voted 
to make no recommendation to the rankandfile on the agreement 
reached early thursday morning after a 16month labor dispute in 
the nations second largest school district 
i hope this signals a new era of working together of 
cooperation rather than confrontation said school board 
president roberta weintraub 
johnson expects the strike to leave no hard feelings between the 
union and district but said a rift would remain between striking 
teachers and those who crossed picket lines 
teachers had been earning 23440 to 43319 a year depending 
on experience and level of education the new pact raises those 
salaries in the first year of the contract to 25316 and 46594 
and at the end of three years to 29529 and 53938 respectively 
teachers whose contract expired in july 1988 will receive a 
retroactive pay raise for the first year of the new contract 
the agreement also provides teachers a greater say in management 
by creating councils at each school with half the members from the 
teachers ranks and the other half made up of administrators other 
staff and parents the district would no longer have veto power on 
curriculum decisions 
the union made several compromises including agreeing that 
teachers work some hours to recover pay docked when they wouldnt 
hand in grade reports or perform such duties as yard patrol in 
protest actions preceding the walkout 
johnson estimated high school teachers were docked on average 
1000 each and elementary teachers lost up to 700 each 
education in the district had slowed to a crawl since the union 
representing 22000 of the districts 32000 teachers counselors 
and librarians went on strike may 15 
about half the districts 594000 students stayed away from 
school going instead to the beach shopping malls or home many of 
the students who did attend school encountered more games cartoons 
and film strips than lessons 
the impasse broke tuesday after officials on both sides met 
privately in sacramento with state legislators to discuss the 
issues and how the district might receive part of a recently 
announced 25 billion state surplus negotiators said the 
legislators prodded them to resume talks

the warsaw pact offered specific ceiling 
figures on thursday for conventional armed forces in europe a step 
hailed by the united states as proof of another positive 
development at arms talks 
the east bloc failed to provide figures for central europe an 
area where most of the deadly weaponry of both military blocs is 
massed but bulgarian ambassador lyuben petrov speaking for the 
warsaw pact told a news conference figures for a central european 
zone would be presented in the near future 
on tuesday east bloc proposed at the conventional arms talks 
that no nation including the soviet union and the united states 
be allowed to have more than 35 to 40 percent of the combined 
manpower totals of nato and the warsaw pact 
the moves meet us demands aimed at reducing a large warsaw 
pact edge over the north atlantic treaty organization in 
nonnuclear strength as one example soviet tanks now account for 
nearly 70 percent of all nato and warsaw pact armor combined 
petrov said that in strips of contact or frontline areas 
of the 16member nato alliance and the sevennation warsaw pact 
manpower for each side should not exceed 1 million strike aircraft 
should be limited to 1100 combat helicopters to 1300 tanks to 
16000 artillery pieces to 16500 and armored troop carriers to 
20500 
these strips of contact for the warsaw pact would cover the 
leningrad and baltic military districts poland east germany 
czechoslovakia hungary romania bulgaria and three other 
military districts in the soviet union including odessa on the 
black sea 
for the western alliance they include norway denmark belgium 
the netherlands luxembourg west germany italy greece and turkey 
the new east bloc figures are lower than figures proposed 
earlier those were 1350000 manpower 1500 strike aircraft 
1700 combat helicopters 20000 tanks 24000 artillery pieces 
and 28000 armored troop carriers 
the warsaw pact also presented figures for the six categories in 
what the soviet alliance called rear areas on the easts side 
these comprise the byelorussian carpathian kiev moscow volga 
and urals military districts for nato the rear areas are iceland 
britain france spain and portugal 
chief us negotiator stephen j ledogar told reporters at the 
news briefing the figures were proof of another positive 
development and we treat and accept them seriously 
we welcome this further elaboration of the east proposals 
and we welcome in particular the fact that the soviet bloc 
seems to be following the blueprint which the west laid down on 
march 9 
the complex negotiations on conventional armed forces in europe 
opened in march 
nato proposed at that time a limit of 12000 tanks 10000 
artillery pieces and 16800 armored troop carriers for any one

the federal government issued a new aids 
prevention guide today specifically intended for parents and other 
adults to use in counseling young people about the disease 
too many of our young people are dying from aids and unless we 
take immediate action the epidemic will continue to spread among 
this very vulnerable population said health and human services 
secretary louis w sullivan 
the new guide is packaged in a folder containing a number of 
loose pages bundled in three categories one aimed directly at 
adults emphasizing the importance of young people learning about 
aids one with specific information on the disease itself and the 
third with material written for various age levels that parents can 
pass on to their children if they desire 
the publication is being accompanied by radio and television 
public service spots encouraging parents to call the national aids

skepticism voiced by president bush toward soviet intentions 
bush in a commencement address at the coast guard academy in

the bush administration is coming under 
increasing attack for its plan to build new military reactors in 
south carolina and idaho that could provide far more material for 
nuclear warheads than the pentagon says it will need 
the latest barrage of criticism comes from the general 
accounting office the investigative arm of congress it said 
wednesday that lawmakers were given inaccurate and incomplete 
information about key elements of the plan to build reactors in 
south carolina and idaho 
the gao also questioned whether it was necessary to build the 
reactors which the energy department says would provide 150 
percent of the anticipated need for tritium a radioactive gas used 
to boost the explosive power of nuclear warheads 
the administration wants to build one reactor at the federal 
savannah river site near aiken sc and another at the idaho 
national engineering laboratory near idaho falls it says they 
could be built within 10 years for 68 billion

the worlds first fullsized nuclear 
reactor is eligible to become a national historic site but some 
people wonder if a device that helped kill 40000 japanese in world 
war ii should bememorialized at all 
i believe it has a great deal of historical significance 
said bill heine manager of the hanford restoration project for 
westinghouse hanford co anyone in the nuclear industry would 
agree to that 
there is little question that the crash construction of the b 
reactor during the manhattan project was an engineering marvel it 
produced plutonium for the atomic bomb that destroyed nagasaki on 
aug 9 1945 the bomb that fell on hiroshima three days earlier 
was powered by uranium from oak ridge tenn 
historians disagree on the importance of the atomic bomb in 
bringing an end to the war said lindy cater of the hanford 
education action league a spokanebased citizens watchdog group 
different people have different points of view about the 
participation of hanford and what resulted in many deaths at 
nagasaki 
b reactor has been ruled eligible for inclusion on the national 
register of historic places but no nomination has been made 
what brings the issue to the forefront now is a newly released 
draft environmental impact statement on what to do with eight 
closed reactors along the columbia river that produced plutonium 
for nuclear weapons options range from dismantling them to burying 
them where they are under huge mounds of dirt 
the department of energy has scheduled public hearings this year 
in portland ore richland spokane and seattle the department 
has set a july 28 deadline for comments but has no specific date 
for a final report 
as an historic site the reactor would boost tourism said dave 
hansen of the washington department of community development 
naturally our position would favor its retention its a very 
early example of atomic technology 
memorials to war are not uncommon 
the enola gay the b29 that dropped the hiroshima bomb is 
stored at the smithsonian institution 
bocks car which dropped b reactors plutonium on nagasaki is 
on display at the air force museum at wrightpatterson air force 
base in dayton ohio 
battlefields around the world where thousands died are now 
memorials 
but none of those memorials are classified as radioactive waste 
as the b reactor is and while current generations face little 
danger from the enola gay or antietam national battlefield b 
reactor plutonium still arms warheads 
b reactor has the most historical significance of those on the 
hanford nuclear reservation and in 1976 was designated a national 
historic mechanical engineering landmark by the american society of 
mechanical engineers 
it was the first fullsized nuclear reactor in the world with 
construction beginning a few months after physicist enrico fermi 
achieved the worlds first nuclear chain reaction at the university 
of chicago 
it was built by 55000 workers during a fevered 15 months ending 
sept 26 1944 as the nation was racing nazi germany to build an 
atom bomb 
today the control room and the adjacent room where fermi worked 
are still intact the walls are painted a government green the 
reactor dials are still and a wellworn operators manual sits on 
a desk while the reactor vessel is classified as lowlevel nuclear 
waste and must be disposed of no measureable radiation is emitted 
into the visitor areas hanford officials say 
although hanford is still a heavily guarded plutonium production 
site the b reactor is only a mile from the publicaccess state 
highway 240 a road could be built to the reactor with the area 
behind it fenced off officials say 
already there are some displays showing photos of the history of 
the reactor along with pioneering tools and the giant exposed face 
of the reactor where the nuclear fuel rods were inserted 
only about 200 people per year tour the reactor now according 
to doe spokesman tom bauman who said the agency isnt sure how 
much controversy might develop and are waiting to see the results 
of the public hearings 
us rep sid morrison rwash who represents hanford said 
he too isnt sure of the public response its important for a 
number of us to try and sort out how important b reactor is to 
history

a new ethnic studies requirement at the 
university of california at berkeley that includes the study of 
european americans is being heralded by supporters as an important 
step in improving campus curriculum 
opponents call it the hula hoop of the 80s something that 
creates great excitement at the moment but will likely be soon 
forgotten 
i think its the most significant requirement of its kind to 
be adopted at any university that i know of because its based upon 
the multicultural heritage of this country said history 
professor lawrence levine 
it sends a signal to schools nationwide that it is important to 
examine the ethnic groups that are part of the formula that 
created america said levine a member of the faculty committee 
that drafted the proposal 
faculty members recently approved the american cultures 
requirement beginning in 1991 freshmen and sophomores will have 
to take a course on race culture and ethnicity in american history 
and society entering juniors or seniors beginning in fall 1993 
also will have to meet the requirement 
the plan calls for study of three of five major cultural groups 
african americans american indians asian americans 
chicanolatinos and european americans 
when a similar proposal without the european american element 
reached the academic senate in may 1988 a shouting match erupted 
and the measure was ultimately sent back to a faculty committee 
but the compromise addition of europeans did not diminish all 
opposition only 20 percent of eligible faculty voted on the final 
measure and some supporters took the turnout as a distressing sign 
of apathy 
i think it was a very bad idea but the political pressure was 
very strong to pass it said hans sluga a philosophy professor 
who opposed the proposal and boycotted the vote to oppose political 
pressure to approve the requirement he called the idea the hula 
hoop of the 80s 
sluga favored a free market approach to education that 
allows students to choose their own courses he also criticized the 
requirement as too narrowly defined because it focuses on cultural 
groups inside the united states 
you could study chinese in chinatown but not in china he 
complained 
the intent is to incorporate voices that have been left out of 
american history institutions music and literature said 
student body president jeff chang who helped coordinate students 
lobbying the faculty 
nearly half the 22671 undergraduates at berkeleye are white 
slightly more than onefourth are asian about 11 percent are 
hispanic and 7 percent black 
advocates agreed that the test of the requirement will be in its 
implementation and barbara christian a professor in the 
afroamerican studies department acknowledged it will be a 
challenge to teach the courses 
the question is whether or not we will be able to do the 
necessary work to know the different groups i think we as a 
faculty are going to have to learn a great deal and there will 
probably be team teaching as a result 
proposals include an architecture class to study ethnic 
neighborhoods and a linguistics class to study ethnic dialects and 
bilingualism 
schools across the country are debating plans designed to 
highlight the contributions of minorities and women 
last year stanford university replaced its freshman western 
culture requirement with a new course that rejected many classic 
works in favor of books by feminists minority leaders and social 
revolutionaries 
other university of california campuses including santa barbara 
and davis are considering mandatory ethnic studies classes and 
irvine has approved required courses in multicultural studies and 
international affairs 
at berkeley some opponents argued that the course is 
unnecessary while others said the campus lacks the needed 
classroom space 
although ucberkeley chancellor ira michael heyman who strongly 
supported the requirement assured faculty members that the campus 
longterm expansion plans include adequate facilities critics 
dismissed the promise 
leaders of some minority student groups said the amendment to 
include european americans undermined the intent of the requirement 
weve learned it all our lives said emily ihara chairwoman 
of the asian student union i felt like we didnt need to learn 
more about it in this class the whole point is to make up 
sometimes for what happens in the classroom 
other supporters said they bowed to political reality when they 
endorsed the revised requirement 
we felt we can live with that for the larger purpose of 
getting the requirement explained guillermo rodriguez the lone 
student member on the uc regents and an advocate who worked on the 
proposal for three years there is also a need to understand some 
of the cultures of nonminority or nonthird world people 
rodriguez 21 a junior majoring in sociology countered 
assertions that the requirement is largely symbolic i think its 
moving in the right direction i think if it opens one mind thats 
one mind opened and thats good enough

yes those creative geniuses who come up with 
network television shows have been working overtime to create 
fascinating new concepts that will cause you the loyal network 
television viewer to ignore cable movies sportschannels and 
videocassette rentals and race over hot coals if necessary in 
order to watch the local network affiliate of your choice 
only kidding despite proof that their audiences are tuning out 
the networks apparently feel compelled for 198990 to cling to 
tired premises and spinoffs 
they apparently hope these will miraculously entice viewers who 
come to the screen for reasons that despite endless research and 
discussion seem to completely evade network executives still 
baffled that lonesome dove won its time period against the 
sex tapes 
oh but how can you say that just look at this innovation on 
tap for next season 
abc has free spirit a show about a housekeeper whos a 
witch now thats quality entertainment whens the last time you 
saw a television show about a witch well 1972 bewitched of 
course that was a good 17 years ago and 17 years is a long time 
to go without a show about a witch 
cbs has wolf this is a show about a cop who was framed and 
forced off the force and now works as a private investigator and 
hopes to clear his name hmmm sounds suspiciously like private 
eye on nbc two years ago 
then nbc has sister kate this is a show about a nun yeah 
yeah the flying nun 1970 but this is different this a nun 
with an attitude sally field was a cute nun very different show 
then theres nutt house on nbc a wacky mel brooks comedy 
about a bunch of madcaps who run a hotel sounds a little like 
fawlty towers who cares nobody watches british tv over here 
well cbs has rescue 911 where you get to see reallife 
rescues so unlike the reallife arrests on cops or 
recreations of reallife crimes on unsolved mysteries and 
americas most wanted these are rescues see 
abcs homeroom is about an innercity teacher who uses humor 
to get through to his students welcome back kotter no way 
teachers name is harper 
nbcs baywatch is a really unique show about lifeguards 
oops even nbc is pushing this show as a reincarnation of 
chips never mind 
nbc also has hardball about two cops who are mismatched 
partners but eventually form a bond it goes into the old miami 
vice time period no no no this is not a white copblack cop 
deal this is old copyoung cop 
marcy carsey and tom werner are putting yet another standup 
comic in a primetime sitcom this time its jackie mason in abcs 
from this moment on well it is hard to argue with success 
carseywerners other comics in sitcoms are bill cosby and roseanne 
barr so it worked twice 
then theres abcs living dolls a spinoff of whos the 
boss and abcs family matters a spinoff of perfect 
strangers and nbcs mancuso fbi a spinoff of the 
miniseries favorite son 
as usual like grass sprouts working their way up through the 
concrete there are a few unusualsounding shows on the schedule 
life goes on is about a family with an 18yearold downs 
syndrome son and stars an actor who has downs syndrome its on 
abc which put on the unique thirtysomething last season 
hugh wilson who created the wonderful franks place 
canceled of course by cbs has a new cbs comedy the famous 
teddy z about a hotshot young hollywood agent 
franks place stars tim and daphne reid also found a place 
in the new cbs schedule in snoops an hour comedymystery that 
draws intelligent inspiration from nick and nora charles 
steven bochco la law hooperman has a show for abc 
about a 15yearold medical intern doogie howser md it 
sounds ridiculous but you cant say its been done before

preempted for live coverage from china when cbs presents dallas 
the missing minutes tonight a 3minute capsule synopsis of the 
missing parts those on the west coast didnt miss the minutes and 
wont get to see the 3minute version 
goodbye gilda saturday night live host steve martin paid 
emotional homage to gilda radner on the seasonender last week 
instead of the usual monologue martin introduced a tape of their 
1978 classic sketch a fantasy dance sequence that paid tribute to 
fred astaire and ginger rogers but was set in the shallow and 
distinctly unromantic setting of a 70s discotheque after the 
tape was over martin said whenever i see that tape i cant 
help thinking how great you looked and how young i was gilda 
were going to miss you the show went on as usual except that

the origin of entrepreneurship the 
overwhelming desire to create an original inventive course in life 
no matter what the risks seems to become mistier rather than 
clearer with each new study 
among claims is that the seed can be found in economic or 
psychological deprivation in a newspaper route in a rural 
environment in a youngsters age relative to siblings in having 
had a mentor in having moved while a child 
most claims can be made to sound reasonable deprivation may 
spur ambition newspaper routes teach selfreliance rural 
economies offer an understandable microcosm of larger economies 
mentors show the way moving arouses curiosity 
perhaps there is some truth in such assertions and at least a 
bit also in some of the other claims legends and myths that 
surround the subject neither can you dismiss the role of venture 
capitalists who supply the wherewithal 
seldom however are teachers given much credit but of late 
there is no denying their role from grammar school to graduate 
school individual teachers entrepreneurs themselves have 
accepted the assignment of showing the way 
in many instances the spur to these teacherentrepreneurs has 
been the very failure of the educational system to tackle the job 
even now youngsters may go through school without ever considering 
the selfemployment option 
at the university of north carolina at charlotte professor 
irvin b tucker iii faced the problem by investing his own money to 
establish tucker press in 1987 his purpose was to produce a high 
quality economics textbook 
keeping costs to a minimum he published economics for young 
americans along with a teachers guide the state of north 
carolina adopted the text last year for a fiveyear period the 
book has sold thousands of copies 
for his work tucker received a 15000 award from the freedoms 
foundation valley forge pa a nonprofit nonsectarian 
nonpolitical organization that seeks to foster an understanding of 
american freedoms and opportunities 
for 12 years the foundation has honored educators who seek to 
teach the rewards and risks of the free enterprise system of which 
entrepreneurship is one of the most dramatic expressions 
among those honored this year were sister mary adelaine of notre 
dame academy los angeles who structured a course on wall 
streetmain street and terry applebaum of northwestern 
university who seeks to develop among artists an appreciation of 
business the better to pursue their careers 
steve mariotti was discovered teaching in new yorks jane addams 
vocational high school his course south bronx entrepreneurial 
education program encouraged several black and hispanice students 
to found businesses 
gay burden ferguson economics teacher at mclean county high 
school in rural calhoun kentucky was honored for putting her 
class to work developing and producing a marketing video and 
brochure to lure businesses into the area 
entrepreneurs teachers included arent the kind who easily 
turn down money but one thing is known for sure about this breed 
their primary motive isnt cash but the development and fulfillment 
of ideas 
twentyone teachers in all were honored with cash gifts but the 
big payoff may come later 
that payoff would be if they helped produce a sam walton as in 
walmart stores a steve jobs as in apple computer an an wang as 
in wang labs or a fred smith as in federal express

el paso texas subject el paso intelligence center 
mission collect and share with law enforcement agencies 
information on drug weapon and aliensmugglers 
number of arrests none 
our first task is tactical intelligence that which the field 
agents can use to cause an arrest or seizure says william 
norsworthy director of the center at fort bliss that publishes its 
phone number but reveals little else 
epic might tell the coast guard where to find a specific 
marijuanaladen ship off the florida coast or it might tell the 
texas department of public safety who a certain smuggler hangs 
around with 
but it looks farther downrange too 
whats going to happen two years from now in what part of the 
world we try to figure that out said norsworthy 
at epic representatives of 10 federal agencies gather evidence 
and piece together a criminological jigsaw puzzle that displays 
drug smugglers and other criminal organizations the law 
enforcement consortium doesnt make seizures or arrests and doesnt 
take credit for the arrests it produces 
they are our primary source of intelligence said jim bowen 
senior tactical coordinator for operation alliance an el 
pasobased union of federal agencies that chases and arrests drug 
smugglers along the usmexican border he declined to recount 
specific cases in which epic information resulted in largescale 
busts 
epic started out in 1974 as the southwest border intelligence 
service with 35 employees from the drug enforcement administration 
and the immigration and naturalization service working in cramped 
quarters 
four years later it had a congressional mandate a new name 106 
employees from six federal agencies and 16000 square feet of space 
in central el paso 
now the 15yearold intelligence network occupies a brandnew 
57000squarefoot building on fort bliss where 200 employees of 
the dea ins customs service coast guard marshals service fbi 
internal revenue service federal aviation administration secret 
service and bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms labor 24 hours 
a day 
some of those agencies have been known for fierce turf battles 
but norsworthy said thats rare at epic its pretty unique in 
that we all get along good after 90 to 120 days agents lose their 
agency identity and become part of epic 
epic gives operation alliance threat assessments dossiers 
on illegal organizations along with when and where they are 
expected to operate next it prepares similar assessments for the 
miamibased lightning operations center which tries to keep drug 
shipments out of southern florida 
other information goes to the agencies making up epic the lead 
law enforcement agencies in 50 states the district of columbia 
puerto rico guam the virgin islands and samoa it gets upwards of 
300000 inquiries a year 
usually when police ask for information epic asks why 
something made someone make that call either he saw or heard 
something norsworthy said we ask for that information and we 
build on that we look for patterns and trends all the time 
bits of information can be assembled like a puzzle an id number 
on the tail of a plane a series of large cash bank deposits and 
the sighting of a suspect could start an investigation ending in an 
arrest and seizure 
sometimes it turns out that different police agencies are 
investigating the same organization but arent aware of each other 
in those cases epic brings the agencies together and helps plot 
investigation strategies 
some of the information comes from those cases other times 
member federal agencies contribute some data come from fbi and dea 
offices abroad 
each agent working at epic is limited to the investigative 
methods his or her agency is permitted under us law a wiretap 
for example would require a court order 
if theres any criticism of epic among law enforcement agencies 
its that the centers computer system needs to be upgraded 
just bring them up to the state of the art bowen said 
us rep ron coleman dtexas represents the district where 
epic resides a few years ago he helped fight off a proposal to 
move it to washington now he would like to improve its computers 
my goal is to make it the absolute stateoftheart 
intelligencegathering center in the country he said 
just how advanced the computer and communications systems are is 
a secret norsworthy isnt telling but he said a police agency 
calling epic probably will find the information it wants on a 
suspect 
if hes ever been the subject of an investigation or an 
associate of someone whos been the subject of an investigation 
he said chances are pretty good

pope john paul ii is coming to 
scandinavia where roman catholicism vanquished by the protestant 
reformation was proscribed for more than 300 years until a century 
ago 
the pope will spend 10 days in norway iceland finland denmark 
and sweden starting june 1 
overwhelmingly secular and affluent scandinavians especially 
the young show little patience with traditional moral standards 
attitudes toward sex are liberal and marriage is optional in 
sweden for example the statistics bureau said last year that some 
50 percent of all couples living together dont bother to exchange 
vows the figure is higher in iceland 
couples who register as cohabitants have virtually the same 
legal rights as do man and wife 
in sweden and denmark homosexual couples have equal rights 
birth control is encouraged abortions occur at a rate of about 
20 per 1000 women while slightly lower in finland an abortion is 
available without questions to any woman above the age of consent 
up to the 12th week of pregnancy 
in the era of aids condoms are distributed in many schools and 
advertised on billboards 
we are in a helpless situation said ake goransson director 
of studies for the roman catholic diocese in sweden 
we have many catholics who dont marry not because they are 
afraid they wont be able to divorce but because marriage is just 
not common in sweden 
swedish catholics a community of 135000 had only 260 
marriages last year 
the scandinavian dioceses run education classes usually on 
saturdays to teach the vaticans position on such questions as the 
sanctity of marriage and the purpose of sex 
we have a broad program of christian education for our kids so 
they can make their own decisions said goransson the church 
doesnt want to tell catholics what to do you must follow your own 
conscience but your conscience must be taught 
the pope was expected to speak on issues of mans faithfulness 
to god and to each other and parental responsibility said 
goransson 
to one degree or another the lutheran church is an arm of the 
state in all five countries about 90 percent of the populations 
belong to the official taxsupported churches 
membership in the state church is automatic for anyone born of 
lutheran parents clergymen are civil servants paid by the state 
and bishops are appointed by government 
but religion plays little role 
in sweden about 10 percent say they are regular churchgoers in 
norway cities are virtually shut down for the easter holiday while 
norwegians go skiing 
some say christianity never really took root when it came to the 
viking cultures 1000 years ago 
the benedictine monk ansgar brought christianity to denmark and 
sweden in the 9th century but it took two centuries to spread 
throughout scandinavia 
danish chroniclers say a monk called poppo convinced king harald 
bluetooth of christianitys power by carrying a redhot iron in his 
hands in the year 960 
the roman church came to finland by way of an englishled 
crusade in 1155 it vied with the orthodox church from russia 
which still has a strong foothold 
the 16thcentury protestant reformation was the tool for the 
scandinavian kings to seize church property and the wealth of what 
had become a powerful force in sweden the church owned onefifth 
of all farms 
for one brief period in denmark being catholic was a capital 
offense 
freedom of religion was restored throughout the region in the 
19th century and today catholics are a small but growing minority 
a liberal policy toward refugees in sweden norway and denmark 
has brought catholics mostly from chile in the last several years 
thousands also came from poland after the labor unrest that began 
in 1980 in the 1950s others came from hungary and elsewhere in 
eastern europe

not far from the corporate towers of manhattan 
where an older generation jostles daily with foreign competitors 
michael rubins high school students are itching to get into the 
game 
these teenagers arent thinking softball at the local park in 
queens they want to play economic hardball so theyre doing what 
comes naturally in the businessminded 1980s theyre studying 
japanese 
throughout the united states the study of japanese and other 
socalled exotic languages such as chinese and russian once 
the preserve of colleges is booming in high schools junior high 
schools and even on the elementary level educators say 
as global economic forces shift from what was once blithely 
called the american century toward what some have dubbed the 
pacific century american youth are going with the flow 
delighted educators say 
i took japanese because i see japan as the next pacific 
power said alwin eversley a bony bespectacled 15yearold who 
makes it plain he respects economic muscle like many students in 
rubins class at townsend harris high school alwin plans to be a 
business major in college 
a lot of businessmen in america they dont speak the language 
of japan well he said and so the japanese are not influenced 
by them that much they look down upon them a little 
while new interest in russian and chinese has been spurred by 
liberalization in the soviet union and chinas rapid social 
changes and arabic is on the rise the biggest surge in high 
school language study has been in japanese said c edward scebold 
executive director of the american council on the teaching of 
foreign languages 
educators say years of media lamentation over the 
uncompetitiveness of us industry marked not only businessmen but 
also a businessoriented younger generation 
every time a student turns around theres either a japanese 
product or an article in the paper about japan its like a 
builtin pr program said fred lorish a teacher of japanese at 
south eugene high school in oregon 
in a high school in battle creek mich officials were 
astonished when they offered a japanese class in the only slot 
available 7 am and 28 students showed up in bloomington 
ill japanese studies blossomed after japans mitsubishi and 
chrysler motors jointly opened a plant last october in new york 
state junior high schools will be authorized to offer japanese for 
the first time next fall 
california oregon and washington now proudly consider 
themselves the eastern bulwark of the bustling pacific rim and have 
embraced japanese business and culture 
i dont want to sound corny and say the futures in the 
pacific rim but its true said tanya renee hamlin a 
15yearold freshman at franklin high school in seattle 
oregon which had an early taste of japanese power when its 
coastline was bombed by imperial navy submarines in world war ii 
has sponsored a virtual invasion since 1980 the state has gone 
from one high school with 15 students of japanese to 26 schools 
with nearly 1700 students this year 
in 1988 oregon began the nations first fulltime grade 16 
immersion program in japanese in which students are taught 
subjects half the day in english and half in japanese said david 
arlington of the state department of education 
theres definitely a correlation between the rise of the yen 
and the rise in interest in japanese said rubin 44 a new 
yorker who lived in japan for five years and studied at keio 
university i think money talks 
the national governors association concluded as much when its 
task force on international education issued a critical report this 
year 
the international frontier is no longer the future a new age 
has arrived said the task forces chairman virginia gov gerald 
l baliles 
international education teaching and learning about other 
countries their citizens and their languages just how important 
is it to our country as important as economic prosperity national 
security and world stability the task force report said 
but old habits die hard only one in five american high school 
graduates takes more than two years of any foreign language 
according to a 1987 department of education study not one state 
requires a foreign language for a high school diploma 
probably fewer than 500 americans can speak japanese fluently 
today said seiichi makino a visiting professor of japanese at 
harvard university by contrast japanese children begin studying 
english intensively in junior high school 
with the exception of the west coast states and hawaii most of 
the high school japanese programs have started in the last seven 
years about 270 high schools in 35 states offer japanese a jump 
of 50 percent from just two years ago according to the center for 
improvement of teaching of japanese language in high school based 
in urbana ill 
i think communities around the country are beginning to see 
theres a real economic advantage to communicating in japanese 
they want to attract japanese businesses said carol bond 
director of the center 
but more powerful forces than mere economics are at work 
teachers say us preeminence has ebbed and japan has eclipsed 
the united states as the worlds largest creditor and supplier of 
foreign aid 
my sense of the kids i teach is that there is a real almost 
subconscious desire to be international to be part of it 
lorish the 45yearold oregon teacher said what i didnt have 
in the 50s is the sense that my language is a passport to the 
world these kids have it 
there are problems of course like any new demand the language 
boom has outstripped supply in this case that of qualified 
teachers and adequate textbooks teachers say few states offer 
certification in japanese 
we get the same message from teachers over and over again 
they dont know if theyre doing things right bond said 
because of the difficulty of the language there is also a high 
dropout rate teachers say according to the state departments 
foreign service institute it takes 1320 hours of japanese study 
to reach the same level of speech attained in 240 hours of spanish 
or even vietnamese 
interest in foreign languages has been cyclical in the past but 
scebold of the foreign language council believes the latest upswing 
may be more permanent 
there is a realization in the minds of citizens that weve got 
to push kids into these programs god knows those languages 
open a million doors

at the randy bishop home in the heart of 
south central iowas parched cattle country the well has been dry 
since september and hauling water has become routine 
so has wearing clothes longer between washings for bishop his 
wife christine and three young children turning off the shower 
between lathering up and rinsing and leaving to mommy the decision 
on when to flush the toilet 
farming is now even more of a gamble in the stunted pastures 
nestled amid rollercoaster hills along the iowamissouri border 
where rainfall has been less than 50 percent of normal since 
january 1988 
there were a few generous showers in may allowing newly planted 
corn and soybeans to sprout raising spirits and turning pastures 
green farmers now say that with a few more timely rains they may 
have enough moisture to raise corn stalks tall enough to chop up 
for silage to sustain their cattle even if theres not enough rain 
for the crop to mature and be harvested 
im not sure we can catch up in one year and get back to even 
halfway normal says bishop as his pickup truck bumps across a 
pasture seven miles south of mount ayr g i mow it theres 
nothing to rake up 
normally the memorial day weekend is when farmers begin to 
harvest the first of several cuttings of the hay crop 
i dont know when its going to be this year smith says 
smith 65 remembers his father surviving the dust bowl years of 
the 1930s without electricity and air conditioning 
it seemed hotter in the 30s but it certainly didnt last as 
long he says 
average rainfall in iowa from may 1988 through the end of april 
1989 is 2208 inches 10 inches below normal and nine inches less 
than the same period a year earlier that led up to the drought of 
1988 
at blockton total rain from jan 1 1988 through the end of 
april came to 1686 inches just 40 percent of the normal 4191 
inches for that 16month period and the lowest of 162 official 
measuring sites in the state 
blockton mayor richard melvin had to scramble up to the roof of 
his plumbing supply business to make repairs after a recent rain 
we didnt have enough rain to go through the cracks before 
then he said 
the national guard has been hauling water for household use to 
one southeast iowa community and eight in south central iowa since 
may 8 four of those cities are around blockton 
although blocktons municipal well is deep enough to ensure 
water supplies to the communitys 120 households most surrounding 
farms are in trouble and some farmers are traveling almost 80 miles 
roundtrip to haul water 
last year the wells went dry but we had ponds now the ponds 
are going dry melvin said 
in corning where water shortages following droughts in the 
mid1970s led to the development of ample water supplies water 
sales to individuals are up sharply 
the municipal water works has a coinoperated machine that 
dispenses 50 gallons of water for 25 cents sales which totaled 
about 25000 gallons in all of january 1988 ran above 535000 
gallons this month says dean davis director of the municipal 
utility about threefourths of those sales are for household use 
and farmers also have been buying water for mixing with chemicals 
to control insects and weeds 
when there is rain it immediately is soaked up in the loose top 
inches of the soil never reaching deep enough to be stored for the 
rest of the growing season or to flow into depleted farm ponds and 
rivers 
davis checking on the installation of new street lights said 
6foot deep holes revealed bonedry earth below a narrow band of 
moist topsoil 
that is a major worry 
subsoil moisture is deemed 100 percent inadequate throughout 
south central iowa 
in last years drought it was ample subsoil moisture at the 
start of the planting season that enabled many farmers to avoid 
being wiped out 
the lack of water is more scary than the lack of feed smith 
says everyones trying to hang on but everybody i talk to says 
when i run out of water im getting rid of them cattle 
so far theres been no rush to liquidate breeding herds 
but at the rural corning farm of ralph neill productivity 
records on each cow are being reviewed to decide which ones to send 
to the slaughterhouse if feed becomes scarce 
the 51yearold farmer whose family has been working the remote 
fields since 1875 says he knows such action is risky 
if i dont save replacement heifers every year the average 
age of the cows gets one year older and you get in a perilous 
situation he says 
he used to wait for a truckload of cattle before making the trip 
to market to sell the weakest stock from his herd but this day he 
was preparing to sell four cows that had lost calves 
with feed scarce theres no excuse for keeping marginal stock 
on hand he says 
cattlemen in the drought area say the may rains have been enough 
to keep them going another 3045 days even if no more rain falls 
but many veterans say theyve made their cutbacks early 
bill henderson a fifthgeneration farmer near clearfield who 
says nine of his 14 ponds have run dry reduced his herd by 25 
percent a year ago 
you make contingency plans way in advance says henderson

once you have seen the sky you cannot go back into the well 
spoken with the simple eloquence of an old sage the words were 
uttered by a 23yearold chinese woman yearning for freedom in her 
homeland 
lee was our guide one of three on a visit to china my husband 
and i went with the idea that we would find a lockstep society 
cautious about change we found among the educated middleclass 
chinese we met an intense desire for reform a hunger to learn 
everything about western culture and society a disillusionment 
bordering on contempt for the old guard running the nation and a 
fierce determination to better their lives through individual 
initiative 
now like millions of others around the globe were glued to 
the televised images of turmoil in tiananmen square and along the 
bund in shanghai 
of all of the faces that we saw in february of all the faces of 
hunger strikers and peasants and workers and intellectuals 
dominating the television screen and the front page today three 
remain distinct in our memories lee in kunming charlie in xian 
and louie in guilin

lee is a lovely young woman daughter of factory workers 
youngest of four children a former college teacher who is 
determined to have her own travel business one day she lives in a 
single room and eats cafeteriastyle with other employees of the 
travel office where she is the beginner 
she dresses in westernstyle clothes simple and inexpensive 
and likes bright colors every day for five days she wore her red 
shoes when we asked her to forget the regular tour and take us to 
the places she liked she took us to the city park to watch old men 
play card games in the sun children chase ducks lovers canoe on 
the lake we strolled the formal camellia gardens as we tried to 
explain mortgages and credit 
we sat at a restaurant table for hours as she demanded to know 
everything about the us senate she quoted jefferson and was 
curious about fdr and the new deal what was john f kennedy really 
like she asked us to recite the preamble to the constitution and 
made us feel ashamed when we stumbled through it 
one starry night she guided us from tiny coldwater apartments 
to tinier nowater apartments on the campus of the local art 
institute and music conservatory 
in one artists garret we heard him extol through lees 
interpreting the wonders of tibet the trouble it takes to put on 
a modern art exhibit under the watchful eyes of the chinese 
authorities and the thrill of exchanging views with an artist my 
husband from america 
as we left after tea and heady conversation he pressed on the 
american painter a luminous watercolor of the himalayas saying 
i was starving and hallucinating when i painted that picture i 
had no food and no money and i was stranded in tibet i want you to 
have this to remember me by as if anyone could forget him 
in another concrete apartment lit with a glaring overhead bulb 
we sat transfixed as a 14yearold prodigy played mozart on a 
chinese piano under the gaze of a plaster beethoven bust the boy 
was recuperating at home because while studying in beijing hed 
become malnurished and contracted pneumonia in his poorly heated 
dormitory his concentration his technique his passion at the 
keyboard transcended language and hemispheres we burst out in 
applause and bravo bravo as he humbly bowed his head and 
apologized for my inadequacy to play this master 
we left lee on the tarmac as she prepared for her yearly exams 
which qualify me to escort our honored foreign visitors she 
haughtily refused a tip but was giddy as a schoolgirl with the few 
humorous stickers and lapel pins we pressed on her 
please send me postcards and pictures of your town she 
said shyly and a book you think will get past the censors

the day he took us to see the 2000yearold terra cotta army 
the three of us stood alone and stared together at one of the 
wonders of the world charlie urged us to study an ancient clay 
face to imagine what the man who posed for the statue was like 
how he lived what he thought he forced us to contemplate our own 
link with emperor qin shi huang the first person ever to unite 
china in 221 bc

in the present 
and we all decided it was too cold to stand around watching our 
breath freeze so we retired to the coffee shop at the new holiday 
inn and talked politics economics and art charlie asked us if 
california was as wonderful as hed heard and we hedged our 
answers about smog and gridlock as we waxed poetic about orange 
blossoms and hollywood 
revived by strong coffee and frank talk we then moved downtown 
to a main street through an unmarked lobby up three flights of 
unlighted stairs and into a smokefilled room ablaze in flashing 
red spotlights there to the music of the miami sound machine 
blasting from an ancient stereo system we watched a westernstyle 
fashion show as pencilthin models paraded down a runway lined by 
serious unsmiling men and women in mao jackets puffing on strong 
cigarettes the clothes were terrific the setting straight out of

the red guards rampaged through his city as they did nearly 
everywhere in china and his parents were sent from the university 
to the countryside to be reeducated just as chinas last 
emperor pu yi was forced to wear a dunce cap and parade through 
the streets in shame so was louies father it is a bitter memory 
that is where the students jumped to their deaths he said 
pointing down from a rocky promontory into a small manmade lake on 
a college campus they refused to surrender to the madness so 
they killed themselves 
in much of louies speech there is a hint of melancholy it is 
there as he tells us strangers that his mother is terrified the 
red guards will come again and that he must never share his life 
or his secrets with outsiders he must never trust strangers he 
must never ever criticize the authorities 
but louie is a 30yearold husband and father whose family is 
victimized by rampant inflation he knows that in his classless 
society there is a privileged elite and a thriving black market he 
knows from the bbc and the voice of america and the stories from 
friends whove been to hong kong and his own too brief bungled 
trip to study in alaska that a whole new world lies beyond chinas 
borders 
we cannot go back to bound feet and maos caves said louie 
i want to earn money have my own house be free to travel raise 
my child to go to college i want better furniture someday maybe 
even a car an impossible dream now i want to read more books and 
see american movies i dont want my parents to be afraid of 
speaking out china is changing we can never go back today we 
wear a new face 
his wife is a teacher who works solely to pay for the food his 
infant son needs 
one of his greatest joys is a sunday outing when he takes his 
wife and child down to the river to see the rock that looks like an 
elephants trunk there on a sandy beach fledgling entrepreneurs 
sell ice creams and fruit ices balloons and toys perhaps louie 
will draw a picture or contemplate one his wife might recite 
poetry to him his baby will giggle and coo just as babies 
everywhere do 
send me books by your best writers he said we asked you 
mean faulkner steinbeck hemingway 
i dont know them he replied just send anything you 
like and i will like it too

a dwindling number of women injured by ah 
robins cos dalkon shield birth control device still hope to bear 
children if they can get reconstructive surgery the leader of a 
victims rights group says 
but they are frustrated waiting for court approval of robins 
bankruptcy reorganization that has delayed distribution of money 
for surgery said linda hightower director of the dalkon shield 
victims association 
every day we delay is another day that the women who have even 
the smallest chance of having a child lose that chance she said 
wednesday a lot of women are losing heart 
robins pulled the dalkon shield from the market 15 years ago but 
resolution of claims has dragged on 
a reorganization plan including a 25 billion trust fund for 
dalkon shield claimants was approved in july 1988 by judges in us 
district court and us bankruptcy court 
the plan called for richmondbased robins to be acquired by 
american home products corp of new york in a 700 million exchange 
of stock with full payment of creditors 
during the appelate process 100 million of the 25 billion 
trust fund has been available to compensate women with minor dalkon 
shield injuries or poorly documented claims the bulk of the fund 
awaits final confirmation of the reorganization plan 
an appeal of the plan was heard on an expedited basis by the 4th 
us circuit court of appeals last december but no decision has 
been handed down 
were sitting on pins and needles expecting it at any 
moment said guerry thornton jr attorney for the atlantabased 
victims association 
thornton and other lawyers involved in the case said they had 
expected a ruling earlier because of the delays and because 
american home can withdraw from the plan if it is not finalized by 
july 26 one year after its initial confirmation 
robins spokesman roscoe puckett said american home officials 
have given no indication they plan to exercise their option to back 
out of the deal 
i have to believe in my judicial system and believe theyre 
trying to do the right thing ms hightower said i hope the 
justices realize how important it is 
robins filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in august 
1985 came 11 years after it pulled the dalkon shield birth control 
device off the market about 45 million of the intrauterine 
devices had been distributed in the united states and abroad 
at the time of the chapter 11 filing robins had paid about 520 
million to settle more than 9000 damage lawsuits and faced 
thousands more from women who said they suffered injuries including 
infections sterility miscarriages and children with birth defects 
because of their use of the dalkon shield 
about 94 percent of the 200000 women with injury claims against 
robins voted in favor of the reorganization plan but lawyers for 
the appealing claimants challenged the way the vote was taken and 
the amount of the trust fund 
the fact most of the claimants voted in favor of the plan 
increases frustration over the appeals delay said stanley k 
joynes iii a richmond lawyer appointed to represent future dalkon 
shield claimants 
theres a fair amount of resentment that the appeal was even 
filed that a handful of people are holding this up he said 
lawyers representing claimants said millions of dollars in 
potential interest are being lost because the trust fund money will 
not be deposited until appeals to the plan are exhausted 
if the trust had the money today and invested it at current 
rates it would be earning 800000 a day joynes said thats 
the real loss thats what the appeal is costing the dalkon shield 
claimants and the courts aware of that

it takes a memorable advertisement to grab 
the attention of the average american who sees about 80 television 
commercials nightly 
but even the funniest most creative entertaining ad isnt any 
good if it doesnt sell the product says the man who headed a 
campaign that made people nationwide think that virginia is for 
lovers 
david n martin chairman of a richmond ad agency and author of 
romancing the brand says the sales pitch is absent from 
todays increasingly entertaining advertising 
in the last four or five years there has been a return among 
advertising agencies to really high creative very witty very 
charming and very entertaining ads martin whose book has a 
publication date today said in an interview this week 
but too many advertisers try to imitate commercials run by 
market leaders he said 
the makers of pepsi and levis jeans can barely mention their 
products in ads because their name recognition is so high but 
other companies mistakenly believe awareness is sufficient and they 
dont tell consumers why to buy their products 
they try to overwhelm the consumer strictly through 
entertainment martin said it doesnt work with a low share 
there are ways to be wonderfully witty wonderfully entertaining 
and not lose sight of the product 
cable television videocassette records and television remote 
controls have increased viewing options and made competition for 
consumers attention increasingly fierce he said 
escalating television and print advertising costs mean companies 
cant run as many ads putting a premium on getting viewer or 
reader attention with a dramatic advertisement 
finally advertising artists and writers are creative people who 
like their ads to be talked about and to win awards martin said 
creative people dont put selling as first priority he said 
good ads have a magical third dimension that gets them 
talked about and makes them part of common culture such as the 
california raisins or wendys wheres the beef slogan martin 
said 
somewhere embedded in the customers mind is a fact or belief 
about every brand that can be converted into a memorable idea by 
skilled advertising he said 
before cofounding hawley martin partners in richmond last year 
with his brother steve martin was chairman of the martin agency 
named one of the nations hottest agencies by advertising age 
and adweek magazines in 1987 
martin said he wrote romancing the brand after hearing 
advertising professionals complain about the erosion of the 
industry and companies substitution of promotions and coupons for 
advertising

some of the nations top computer 
scientists are challenging big companies they claim are trying to 
gain control over parts of computer programs as fundamental as 
steering wheels and pedals on cars 
a handful of computer firms have filed lawsuits asserting they 
are entitled to copyrights over the look and feel of popular 
computer programs including widely used commands menus and 
displays 
if there were copyrights like this on cars then every 
manufacturer would have to give you a different way to steer 
said richard stallman a 36yearold programmer at the 
massaachusetts institute of technology 
if you learned to drive a ford you wouldnt know how to drive 
chevrolets some cars would have throttles others would have 
joysticks and each manufacturer would have to find a new way of 
doing it he said 
shouting slogans such as hey hey ho ho software tyranny has 
got to go about 150 mit professors and students picketed 
wednesday outside the computer firm lotus development corp 
the protesters including programmers from bostonarea companies 
and some top computer scientists say the firms are trying to gain 
permanent control over computers most fundamental conventions 
theyve mounted a grassroots campaign against companies suing over 
programming 
the rash of lawsuits includes complaints filed by apple computer 
inc against competitors microsoft and hewlett packard co and by 
ashton tate against fox software 
lotus which makes the bestselling computer accounting program 
lotus 123 is suing competitors paperback software international 
and mosaic marketing inc 
lotus and some other software companies contend that unless 
their products enjoy strong copyright protection they will not 
have an economic incentive to develop new programs 
our argument is that outandout copying of other peoples 
work stifles creativity and innovation said lotus spokeswoman 
betsy kosheff copyright law allows you to take other peoples 
work and build on it but not to steal it 
copyright lawyers said the rash of look and feel lawsuits 
began in late 1986 after a federal judge in california ruled that 
a small software company unison world inc had infringed a 
competitors copyright on a program for making customized greeting 
cards 
since then several companies have won similar cases but each 
case rather than settling the law has tended to unsettle it and 
raise more questions said thomas ms hemnes a partner in the 
boston law firm of foley hoag amp eliot 
the mit protest grew out of an advertisement placed in an mit 
student newspaper last month by stallman gerald j sussman a 
professor of electrical engineering and marvin minsky founder of 
mits artificial intelligence laboratory 
they warned that the lawsuits could freeze out new companies 
make computers harder to use and ultimately retard the industry 
until quite recently people invented things everybody gave 
each other all their software we had fun and people made money 
anyway sussman said wednesday id like to see that come 
back 
stallman a prominent programmer who developed emacs a widely 
used system for editing computer programs said it is in the public 
interest to have computer programs share basic attributes so users 
do not have to learn each program from scratch 
the lawsuits he charged will lead to inefficiency and 
gratuitous incompatibility with a heavy cost for the economy 
protesters said they have formed a new organization the league 
for programming freedom to try to pressure lotus and other firms 
to drop the lawsuits 
in leaflets handed out at the pickets the group urged people to 
boycott the firms bringing the lawsuits and to buy competing 
products instead they also advised programmers not to go to work 
for lotus apple and ashton tate

the differences between cable television and 
overtheair broadcasting will fade as networks seek more revenues 
and cable systems look for more programming industry executives 
say 
with statistics showing that cable television expansion has 
reduced network share of the tv audience to about 70 percent from 
highs above 90 percent networks have begun crossing over into the 
cable industry 
nbc chairman robert c wright whose toprated broadcast network 
has formed cable alliances and its own cable channel told an 
industry conference wednesday that nbc will continue to invest in 
cabledelivered products 
wright said some affiliates were unhappy with the networks 
cable ventures but added were a program company and our 
business is to be involved in programs that appear in peoples 
homes 
between 52 percent and 55 percent of the nations television 
homes take cable with an average bill of 1440 a month 
subscriber revenue has climbed from 9695 million in 1976 to an 
estimated 138 billion last year 
today the fact of the matter is that if you simply look at one 
channel as the only way to deliver something that is attractive to 
a home viewer you are substantially limiting your horizons 
wright said 
we think we have capabilities and resources and appetite to 
serve lots of different viewer needs he said 
nbc last month launched cnbc its own cable news and information 
network nbc also has programming agreements with the walt disney 
co which operates the disney channel 
frank biondi jr president of viacom international inc said 
some cable operators were angry when his company syndicated the 
popular show double dare which had been a key ingredient of 
viacoms nickelodeon cable channel 
but biondi said ratings for cable broadcasts of double dare 
have risen as the syndication has neared the end of its run 
john malone president of telecommunications inc the nations 
largest cable operator said operators must take the long view 
about cooperation between cable and overtheair networks 
especially in creating new programming 
but wright said differences will remain principally because of 
the networks ability to reach broad general interest audiences 
wright a former president of cox cable communications said nbc 
will generate most of its income from network television for years 
but we are going to continue to invest in other ways to reach 
other viewers

limits on steel imports have helped change the 
fortunes of us steel producers but industry executives say 
nothing has changed about the way other nations behave in 
international trade 
there is no fair trade in steel especially among the 29 
countries currently operating under the voluntary restraint 
agreements bethlehem steel corp chairman walter f williams 
said wednesday each and every one of them is currently trading 
unfairly in the us 
we have the documentation to prove it he said at the annual 
conference of the american iron and steel institute 
domestic producers are prepared to file trade lawsuits against 
virtually all of the united states trading partners without an 
extension of the fiveyear vra program williams said 
president bush is expected to fulfill a campaign promise to 
extend quotas past their sept 30 expiration but steel executives 
are concerned he may impose the second round of vras for less than 
five years or otherwise weaken the restraints 
after a slow start in october 1984 the vras are now limiting 
imports to around 20 percent of the us market 
the us producers said no nation should be allowed to ship 
steel to the united states without restriction as australia 
mexico and korea have requested 
even canada should be included they said although most steel 
producers seem to be trying to abide by an understanding that 
canada will claim no more than 25 percent of the us market 
political realities make it unlikely bush will demand a quota 
agreement from canada the united states largest trading partner 
said thomas c graham outgoing aisi chairman and president of usx 
corps steel division the largest us steelmaker 
williams cited examples of alleged illegal trade practices 
italy is bailing out their stateowned steel company for the 
third or fourth time frankly ive lost track to the tune of about 
another 4 billion he said 
indonesia plans to give 425 million to save a steel rolling 
mill that is partially government owned imports of indonesian 
steel are not restricted and shipments have risen from virtually 
nothing several years ago to 265000 tons in 1988 
theyre planning to triple their steel exports over the next 
decade williams said 
acesita a governmentowned specialty steel producer in brazil 
is negotiating for a 70 percent expansion in its production 
capacity primarily for export williams said brazilian steel 
capacity already far exceeds domestic needs 
us producers suspect the australian government cut a deal 
with its steelmakers in exchange for private investment in steel 
plants the government would shield the domestic market from imports 
and pay bounties to australian steel consumers for the spread 
between the higher domestic and lower foreign price 
our information is that the australian government starting in 
1984 has paid out up to 64 million a year in these bounties 
williams said 
and british steel has been privatized as of last fall and now 
declares itself debt free and ready to take on all comers after 
their government converted 12 billion of debt into 4 billion of 
equity for an estimated 8 billion loss he said 
last year canada shipped 32 million tons of steel to the 
united states brazil 137 million tons south korea 13 million 
tons france 124 million tons mexico 471200 tons italy 
326200 tons and australia 282000 tons 
steel importers say the us government also subsidized steel 
production through unemployment compensation to laid off workers 
and in defaulted loans 
but us companies say such financial support pales by 
comparison to foreign government ownership and investment in steel 
production

steelmakers have lowered production costs by 
routing out featherbedding work rules now they would like to see 
the same done in the construction trades on which they depend 
the construction industry must begin to eliminate such work 
practices as a day for travel time excessive coffee breaks 
overmanning a lack of any right to subcontract and rules which 
permit workers in one craft to sit idle with pay until those in 
another finish their jobs said thomas c graham chairman of the 
american iron and steel institute 
some companies that contract for construction services also are 
at fault graham said wednesday 
a major offender appears to be the public utility 
industry where too often excessive construction costs can merely 
be passed along to the consumer graham said during the 
institutes annual meeting 
steelmakers have spent an estimated 9 billion on new plants and 
equipment since 1982 and they worry about construction costs as 
they plan for continued modernization he said steel plants also 
require frequent maintenance construction 
construction costs were nearly uniform around the world 20 years 
ago but us steelmakers today spend up to twice as much as 
foreign competitors on the same project graham said 
steel companies last year negotiated with the aflcio for a 10 
percent discount off prevailing labor rates whenever they used the 
labor groups members exclusively on construction jobs but 
pipefitters are not honoring the deal in the chicago area he 
claimed 
the kind of controls on wage rates which weve seen in steel 
must begin to be applied in the building trades graham said 
chicagoarea pipefitters have received total employment cost 
increases since 1982 of 27 percent up to 25 an hour while those in 
the steel industry came down over the same period 
average steel industry labor costs including wages and all 
benefits declined from a record high of 2690 an hour in november 
1982 to 2450 an hour during the first quarter of 1989

three former first jersey securities brokers 
have been indicted in an alleged 1 million money laundering scheme 
the brokers working out of the firms paterson and cherry hill 
offices allegedly hid from the internal revenue service money that 
was given to them by brokerage customers us attorney samuel a 
alito jr said 
in two indictments returned wednesday by a federal grand jury 
the former brokers also were charged with conspiring to defraud the 
irs by preventing the brokerage firm from reporting large cash 
payments alito said 
indicted were kevin odonohue 31 of cherry hill arthur 
basmajian 30 of pittsburgh formerly of cherry hill and dominic 
padula 46 of paterson 
if convicted odonohue faces up to 35 years in prison padula 
faces up to 20 years in prison and basmajian faces up to 15 years 
in prison alito said they all could face fines of 500000 alito 
said 
he said basmajian and odonohue were brokers at the cherry hill 
office and padula worked at the paterson branch 
under irs regulations cash transactions of more than 10000 
were required to be reported to the irs on a form identifying the 
person making the payment 
the irs uses the information to reveal various illegal 
activities including drug transactions and tax evasion alito said 
the indicted brokers allegedly helped customers conceal the cash 
from the irs by having first jersey employees convert cash deposits 
into cashiers checks at local banks in amounts less than 10000 
those checks were then returned to the brokerage and deposited into 
the customers accounts according to the indictment 
alito said all the men are expected to receive summonses and be 
arraigned within 10 days he said there were no plans to indict the 
customers but he added the investigation is continuing 
simply by handling an account of this nature a broker can 
earn commission as the customer buys and sells stocks he said 
all three of those indicted specifically are charged with 
conspiracy in addition odonohue is charged with six counts of 
money laundering basmajian is charged with two counts of money 
laundering and padula is charged with three counts of money 
laundering

a congressman from michigan defends his 
national bottledeposit bill described by an industry opponent as 
too narrow as a first step toward more extensive recycling efforts 
rep paul henry rmich said wednesday that nearly 80 members 
of congress have signed on as cosponsors of his bill which would 
require all states to collect a deposit on beverage containers the 
bill is modeled after michigans bottledeposit law 
if you put a deposit on a bottle or a can youll get that 
container back for recycling but you wont get other materials 
back said karl kamena director of governmental and public 
affairs for the plastics department of dow chemical co 
i dont think the grocery stores should be in the garbage 
business kamena said i think we can do better by developing 
an infrastructure that has curbside pickup making it much easier 
for the consumer 
kamena also chairman of the council of plastics and packaging 
in the environment a coalition of dow and other large 
corporations said obtaining a supply of used containers for 
recycling into other products was a top priority but didnt believe 
bottledeposit laws were the best way to meet that end 
henry said arguments such as those used by kamena sometimes 
are used quite frankly as an attempt to subvert taking that first 
step 
he said he supported curbsidepickup efforts to the extent 
that theyre honestly motivated rather than attempting to derail 
those forms of recycling that have proven effective 
kamena said efforts to reduce solid waste in part through 
improvements in packaging had resulted between 1970 and 1986 in an 
8 percent decline in the number of pounds per capita of containers 
and packaging discarded and not recycled 
members of the council who make up the key players in the 
packaging and plastics industry feel that given this trend 
increased recycling and incineration of waste materials are far 
more promising solutions to our disposal problems than simplistic 
laws attacking packaging kamena said

penn central corp still hunting for a big 
acquisition has enough money to launch a multibilliondollar 
takeover says company chairman and cincinnati financier carl 
lindner

of cash to finance a major acquisition 
penn central continues to have great financial resources he 
said we have over 18 billion in shareholders equity 
the cincinnatibased telecommunications and defense firm is 31 
percent owned by lindners american financial corp 
lindner clearly spelled out the companys intentions at last 
years annual meeting but also said at the time that he was in no 
hurry to make a deal 
last year i said there was no sense of urgency to make any 
move he said that is still true today 
although shareholders equity is approaching 2 billion the 
companys debt is only 220 million 
at the end of 1988 penn central had cash temporary investments 
and marketable securities of 116 billion 
the company has 13 billion in net operating loss 
carryforwards which are past losses that can offset future income 
to reduce taxes acquisitions could produce higher earnings and 
help maximize the benefits of the carryforwards 
penn central is capable of doing a 5 billion or 6 billion 
transaction especially if henry kravis of leveraged buyout firm 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co can do a 25 billion rjr nabisco

america west airlines ended up withdrawing its 
bid for eastern airlines northwest shuttle but the phoenixbased 
carrier says it came out ahead nonetheless 
the publicity is worth far more than we expended said mark 
coleman an america west vice president we literally could not 
buy the positive awareness weve received 
a federal bankruptcy judge in new york on wednesday approved in 
principle developer donald trumps agreement to buy the shuttle for 
365 million after america west pulled out 
america west said it withdrew its offer after failing to arrange 
financing terms it considered acceptable before a wednesday 
afternoon deadline set by eastern 
we came very close but ultimately the lack of time was the 
deciding factor america west president mike conway said in a 
statement 
conway who has spent the past two weeks in new york working on 
the proposed deal also said the airline was impeded by financing 
terms it considered unacceptable 
america west which formally announced its plans to bid for the 
shuttle on may 3 actually had a pair of offers on the table 
the company had offered 415 million for the shuttle and 336 
million for 10 boeing 757s or america west would have bought the 
shuttles gates and landing slots at three airports for 375 
million but no aircraft 
coleman senior vice president of sales and product development 
for america west said the airline remains interested in buying 10 
boeing 757 jets from eastern for 336 million 
paul karos airline analyst with first boston corp in new york 
said america west generated some publicity in the east where the 
airline is not wellknown but where it is strengthening service 
karos said that although america west is highly leveraged it 
appeared to be in a position to line up financing because of the 
profitability of the shuttle operation 
from an america west point of view its only a longterm 
opportunity cost that is lost he said i thought initially the 
shuttle would be dilutive to their earnings but that in the 
longterm it would be a nice return for the company 
coleman said he doesnt believe that america wests failure to 
secure financing impairs the airlines reputation 
quite the contrary we dont think anybody in the financial 
community was not taking us very seriously he said its not a 
question of who are those guys we were a serious contender the 
people in the financial community know that 
the unsuccessful bid does not affect the airlines plans to 
strengthen service to the east coast with the startup of flights 
by july 1 to new yorks laguardia and washington national airports 
coleman said

award in what officials called one of the largest awards in a 
securities arbitration case 
a threemember arbitration panel of the national association of 
securities dealers ruled monday in favor of dennis m crean the 
same man who was awarded 124 million by a federal court jury a

he invested in a complex stock options program in 1984 
nasd said local stockbroker thomas w alison and his new 
yorkbased employer painewebber inc are liable for creans losses 
creans lawyer said his client lost all the money he invested 
during a stock market rally in august 1984 he filed a lawsuit the 
following december 
attorney george w fryhofer iii said alison advised crean to 
invest in a speculative strategy known as a variable hedger 
program 
fryhofer said alison represented the program as low to 
moderaterisk investment and said crean could not lose more than 
15 percent of his investment 
a spokeswoman for painewebber said alison and painewebber both 
declined comment on the case 
as reported earlier this week an atlanta woman was awarded 31 
million in another securities case

they bought on the chance that there might be some interest 
after the figures but there wasnt said a dealer at a major 
london brokerage firm 
the current account deficit widened to 166 billion pounds 26

a modest 27 percent rise in midmay car and 
light truck sales may indicate a softerthanexpected market and 
force two of the big three automakers to extend incentive programs 
analysts say 
the eight major automakers assembling vehicles in north america 
reported wednesday they sold cars and light trucks at an average 
daily rate of 39360 from may 1120 compared with 38334 in the 
same 1988 period 
analysts expected an increase mainly because many incentives 
expired may 11 last year customers planning to buy cars in mid or 
latemay 1988 made their purchases early to take advantage of the 
deals which reduced sales in the period 
i dont know what its going to take to bring customers back 
to the showrooms said analyst mary anne sudol of fitch investors 
service inc in new york i think demand is just tired at this 
point 
general motors corp ford motor co chrysler corp and some 
overseas automakers had wideranging incentive plans in effect this 
month to lure people into showrooms 
but demand may not be there said tom webb a senior economist 
with the national automobile dealers association in mclean va 
basically what sales have shown is that the underlying demand 
is less than what most people expected he said given those 
sales theres going to have to be some further production cuts 
they would be modest though 
automakers often trim their inventories through incentives and 
production cuts 
speculation that ford and gm need to continue incentives past 
their expiration dates during the next two weeks grew with 
wednesdays sales reports said webb theres no doubt about 
that 
ford spokesman bill carroll said he expected another more 
limited incentive package to be announced may 31 when the 
companys current program expires 
most of gms program ends june 5 but on wednesday the 
corporations pontiac division announced a wider selection of cars 
qualifying for cash rebates or lowinterest financing gm also 
boosted the cash offer on a few pontiac cars 
chryslers program continues indefinitely 
the incentive programs were prompted by slowerthananticipated 
sales during the first three months of the year 
since new years day car and truck sales by the eight makers 
were running 36 percent behind the pace for 1988 the secondbest 
year in automotive history car sales were running 54 percent 
behind and truck sales were down 03 percent 
ford sold cars at an average daily rate of 7616 during the may 
period compared with 7410 last year a 28 percent increase car 
sales so far this year were 05 percent behind last year 
fords midmay truck sales were 61 percent higher than last 
year and 29 percent slower for the full year 
gm said its cars sold at a daily rate of 11895 during midmay 
this year up 26 percent from 11592 last year gms yeartodate 
car sales were down 96 percent truck sales in midmay were up 46 
percent and down 01 percent for the entire year 
chrysler said its cars sold in midmay at a daily rate of 3378 
02 percent ahead of the 3372carperday rate last year so far 
this year the no 3 automakers car sales were running 156 
percent behind last years rate 
chrysler truck sales were off 64 percent in midmay but were 
04 percent ahead of the pace for the full year

a federal court ruling that upheld the 
constitutionality of wisconsins antitakeover law was a victory 
for universal foods corp in its fight against a hostile 
acquisition bid 
attorneys were notified wednesday that the law which prevents 
successful bidders from swiftly selling newly acquired assets was 
upheld by the 7th circuit court of appeals in chicago 
the law had been challenged by high voltage engineering corp a 
company owned by new york investors who began a campaign last year 
to buy a controlling share of universal stock 
in a 21page decision judge frank h easterbrook said 
wisconsins law may well be folly we are confident that it is 
constitutional 
clifford press deputy chairman of high voltage said his 
company would review its options in light of the ruling 
the court found that although the statute may well be economic 
folly it is constitutional press said while not deciding the 
poisonpill case the opinion does cast serious doubt on 
universals justsayno defense in light of the court decision 
we are reviewing our options 
the legislature enacted the law to help wisconsin companies ward 
off hostile takeovers easterbrook said it requires a successful 
bidder to wait three years before completing a merger or acquiring 
more than 5 percent of the wisconsin companys assets unless the 
company has agreed to the deal 
as a practical matter wisconsin prohibits any offer 
contingent on a merger between bidder and target a condition 
attached to about 90 percent of contemporary tender offers he 
said 
easterbrook said he and judges william j bauer and hubert l 
will questioned whether the law is fair to shareholders because 
tender offers are a way for investors to bypass company management 
the prospect of takeover induces managers to run corporations 
more efficiently he said 
skepticism about the wisdom of a states law does not lead to 
the conclusion that the law is beyond the states power however 
he said unless a federal statute or the constitution bars the 
way wisconsins choice must be respected 
universal presidernt guy a osborn who has urged shareholders 
not to accept the high voltage offer said his attorneys told him 
that we are the first company in more than four years that has 
been successful in staying independent 
high voltage had offered to buy universal stock at 38 a share 
a deal valued at about 750 million 
the law was previously upheld march 18 by judge joseph p 
stadtmueler of us district court in milwaukee

top business economists today predicted that 
economic growth will slow dramatically this year but the nation 
should be able to forestall a recession until at least 1990 
the consensus of 54 forecasting experts surveyed by the national 
association of business economists was that america will experience 
a growth recession in which the economy continues to expand 
but at a very slow pace 
the slowdown is expected to be accompanied by a moderate 
increase in unemployment and higher inflation due to an emerging 
upturn in food and energy prices according to the associations 
latest quarterly survey 
1990 continues to be the year economists predict a recession 
will arrive fortythree percent predict a downturn then while 20 
percent expect record peacetime expansion to end this year 
that projection is slightly more optimistic than the groups 
last quarterly forecast issued in february when 75 percent of 
those surveyed expected a recession this year or next 
in todays survey 17 percent forecast a recession for 1991 and 
20 percent said it would be 1992 or beyond before a downturn occurs 
recent government reports measuring the economys performance so 
far this year have suggested that growth is slowing in response to 
a federal reserve campaign to engineer a socalled soft 
landing in which the economy slows enough to cool inflation 
without slipping into a recession 
but the forecasters warned that the real trick from an 
economic policy perspective is preventing the forces that are 
responsible for a major slowdown from degenerating into a fullblown 
recession 
soft landings have often appeared possible but inflation 
has invariably worsened the group said in a summary of its 
findings with the runup in prices government policy has been 
forced to squeeze still harder and soft landings are lost in the 
process 
the analysts median forecast was that the gross national 
product the broadest measure of the economys health would grow 
at an sluggish annual rate of 13 percent during the final three 
quarters of 1989 
for the year overall the gnp was forecast to grow 28 percent 
down from 39 percent in 1988 growth was expected to slow even 
further in 1990 dropping to 18 percent 
that prognosis is considerably more pessimistic than the bush 
administration which is pinning its budget and deficitreduction 
plans on gnp growth of 32 percent this year and next 
the government reported today that the gnp grew at a 43 percent 
annual rate in the first three months of 1989 much slower than 
previously thought the pace was a lackluster 18 percent when a 
statistical bounceback from last years drought is excluded 
jay n woodworth president of the business economists group 
said the new gnp report reflects a downward revision in the amount 
of inventories held by businesses which bodes well for the economy 
woodworth said that were the groups economists polled today 
they might be just a trace more optimistic than they were when 
the survey was conducted earlier this month 
the overall slowing of the growth predicted in the forecasters 
survey was expected to reflect a sharp slackening in key sectors of 
the economy 
growth in industrial production was forecast at 32 percent in 
1989 and 18 percent in 1990 down from 57 percent last year 
construction of new homes and apartments was projected at 141 
million units in 1989 and 144 million in 1990 compared with 149 
in 1988 
car and truck sales were forecast to slip to 149 million for 
this year and next down from 159 million in 1988 
the economists also forecast that the slowdown in economic 
growth would be accompanied by an increase in the unemployment rate 
from a 15year low of 5 percent in march averaging 54 percent for 
all of 1989 and 58 percent in 1990 
inflation which advanced at a sharp 66 percent pace in the 
first four months of 1989 was expected to peak midyear and then 
become more moderate price increases were forecast to average 53 
this year and 47 percent in 1990 up from 44 percent in 1988 
progress on the countrys twin trade and budget deficits 
meanwhile was expected to continue over the next two years but at 
a slower pace 
the median trade deficit forecast was 112 billion for 1989 and 
100 billion in 1990 down from 1198 billion in 1988 the slower 
pace of improvement was linked to expectations of a drop in net 
exports from 991 billion in 1988 to 90 billion this year and 76 
billion in 1990 
the budget deficit which reached 1551 billion in 1988 was 
pegged at 160 billion for 1989 and 140 billion in 1990 that 
would exceed the grammrudman deficit reduction targets of 136 
billion and 100 billion for this year and next respectively 
the economic slowdown also was evident in the economists 
forecast for personal consumption expenditures which account for 
twothirds of overall economic activity consumer spending was 
expected to grow by 25 percent this year and 19 percent in 1990 
down from 28 percent in 1988

nintendo co ltd spent most of its 100year 
history producing playing cards with the cherry blossoms and cranes 
of traditional japan now its trump card is a modern computer game 
that is the bestselling toy in the united states 
the top japanese maker of home computer video games reported 
17 billion in us sales in 1988 alone and is believed to have at 
least a 75 percent hold on the american market for the hightech 
toys 
nec home electronics a us subsidiary of japanese computer and 
telecommunications giant nec announced last tuesday it has devised 
a superior home video game system that will go on sale in the 
united states this fall but nintendo executives say theyre not 
worried 
for nearly a century nintendo was literally a house of cards 
until the 1970s its main products were playing cards for a 
traditonal japanese game called hanafuda as well as ones used in 
western card games 
in the 1980s the company of 690 employees nestled in a green 
valley in japans ancient capital kyoto began making toys with 
audio visual features using microcomputers last year only three 
years after introducing its games in the united states the 
nintendo entertainment system nes was the no 1selling toy 
there according to toy and hobby world magazine 
in late april the company released its newest computer toy 
game boy a pocket version of the nes system in japan it will 
go on sale in the united states this summer game boy has an 
8bit microprocesser that can be used with a variety of game 
cartridges 
consumers and they are not only kids nintendo says 
apparently are ecstatic over games called super mario brothers 
2 and zelda ii they devoured the legend of zelda last 
year and snapped up mike tysons punchout as soon as it hit 
toystore shelves 
nintendo spokesman hiroshi imanishi says the games originally 
were developed from the premise that japans contemporary kids are 
miniature versions of their workaholic parents 
what with hectic schedules of school afterschool schools and 
other lessons they required games they could play alone indoors 
and within a short period of time 
considering all the pressures of childrens schedules we 
searched for something they could play for 30 minutes to an hour 
and walk away with a sense of excitement and satisfaction 
imanishi said 
those who follow the fortunes of video game makers say 
nintendos success stems from its control over licensees who 
develop many of the hundreds of games that can only be played on 
nintendo consoles 
nintendo was able to put out enough different titles of 
games that it made people want to have the hardware said rodney 
harada an analyst at merrill lynch amp co in tokyo and nintendo 
controls so much of the hardware market that software developers 
have to go through it 
in the united states some of nintendos competitors are crying 
foul over this arrangement the company is the target of a 250 
million lawsuit by atari corp of sunnyvale calif 
the antitrust lawsuit filed in february alleges that nintendo 
forbids its developers to sell adaptations of their games to other 
video game companies nintendo says the allegation is frivoulous 
atari has filed this lawsuit because of its lack of efforts to 
expand its own market in computer games said imanishi 
meanwhile nintendo reported sales for the first half of its 
fiscal year ending in february totaled 188 billion yen or 14 
billion up 471 percent over the same period the previous year 
a recent survey of 1000 publicly traded japanese companies 
showed that nintendo stocks had risen more than 80 times in value 
over the last 14 years by far the largest jump in value among any 
of the companies surveyed 
its games also have been a phenonenon at home where the video 
system is called the family computer as of march however the 
united states surpassed japan as the biggest consumer of its 
consoles 
more than 13 million consoles have sold in each country at 
about 112 in japan where consumer prices are among the highest in 
the world and an average us price of 80 
enough nintendo game cartridges 160 million have been sold 
in japan to supply every japanese man woman and child with 40 
million left over about 75 million cartridges have been sold so 
far in the united states 
last year 97 percent of nintendos revenues came from sales of 
computer games in both countries and imanishi says 95 percent of 
the companys efforts are channeled into developing new games for 
the console but the company is not worried that its explosive 
success could fizzle 
we are creating entertainment and that is a timeless concept 
that doesnt change imanishi said 
for the future nintendo is developing software that will allow 
its computer console owners to trade stocks and do their banking at 
home they are also seeking ways to appeal to consumers beyond the 
10 to 17yearold males who are now their biggest customers

a new report by the agriculture department 
says prices of farmland nationally are going up for the third 
consecutive year and may rise more than many analysts were saying a 
few months ago 
the farmland forecast was included wednesday in a report on 
agricultural income and finance by the departments economic 
research service it said values continue to rise and could 
advance 7 percent to 9 percent this year 
a tentative forecast made last december called for a farmland 
value gain this year of around 2 percent to 4 percent 
the agency announced last month that farmland values including 
buildings rose nationally in 1988 by 6 percent to an average 
nationally of 597 per acre the second consecutive increase 
farmland prices sank to a 19year low of 548 per acre in 1986 
before turning up in 1987 
with real estate now accounting for about threequarters of 
the farm sectors total assets movements in land values 
dramatically affect net worth the report said coupled with 
stable debt higher land values could add 40 billion to the wealth 
of the farm sector

preliminary signup figures released by the 
agriculture department show that farmers are putting millions of 
idled crop acres back to work this year 
under this years programs farmers will idle 292 million 
acres little more than half of the 542 million acres contracted 
to be taken from crop production under the 1988 programs officials 
said wednesday 
despite the decline from last year the prospective 1989 idled 
acreage would still represent an area larger than the state of 
pennsylvania 
to be eligible for federal price supports and related benefits 
farmers are required to take a percentage of their base acres from 
crop production and put the land in conservation uses that help 
protect the soil 
last years drought cut production severely triggering higher 
grain prices and a drain on us stockpiles the department eased 
idling requirements for this years crops in an effort to rebuild 
inventories 
the idled or diverted acres signed up for 1989 included 
corn 10 million acres down from 28 million signed up for 1988 
sorghum 28 million acres down from 41 million barley 21 
million acres down from 29 million and oats 300000 acres 
unchanged 
in all feed grain acres signed up to be idled under the 1989 
programs totaled 152 million acres down from 282 million 
contracted last year 
additionally wheat farmers signed up to idle 95 million acres 
this year compared with 228 million acres in 1988 cotton 34 
million acres up from 21 million and rice 11 million acres 
unchanged 
the usda report said farmers enrolled 1681 million acres of 
feed grain wheat cotton and rice in the 1989 program which 
represented 763 percent of the 2203 million acres in the national 
base area for those crops the idled acres are part of the 1681 
million acres that were enrolled 
last years gross enrollment was 1878 million acres which 
represented 834 per cent of the 1988 national base of 2252 
million acres

developer donald trump plans to have eastern 
airlines northeast shuttle flying as the renamed trump shuttle in 
about two weeks the head of the business said thursday 
bruce nobles president of trump shuttle said the new service 
would be reliable comfortable efficient and clean 
us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland earlier thursday 
formally approved easterns 365 million shuttle sale to trump 
lifland had approved the sale in principle late wednesday after 
rival suitor america west airlines withdrew its 415 million offer 
after failing to arrange financing 
im elated about it ive been unemployed for three months 
its a relief said bill sanford a striking eastern pilot from 
marietta ga who is one of 170 pilots tentatively hired by trump 
shuttle 
the deal for the new yorkwashingtonboston shuttle should be 
closed in about two weeks and the trump shuttle should be operating 
soon after that nobles told reporters at the bankruptcy courthouse 
in manhattan 
nobles said trump was aiming to capture 75 percent of the 
shuttle market split with pan am corp by the first year of 
operation but he called that goal a little ambitious 
the shuttle is used mainly by business travelers and was 
easterns only consistently profitable operation before the march 4 
strike by its machinists which was joined by its pilots and flight 
attendants unions because of the walkout it lost many passengers 
to pan ams rival shuttle 
trump has pledged to spend tremendous amounts of money to 
upgrade the shuttle whose fleet of 21 aging blueandsilver 
boeing 727s will be redecorated and emblazoned with red black and 
gold stripes and trumps name on the tail 
trump who owns several casinohotels in atlantic city nj 
also operates a helicopter service between new york and that resort 
city and has indicated an interest in routing the shuttle there 
miamibased eastern initially agreed to sell the shuttle to 
trump last october the deal was delayed by court challenges from 
easterns unions and the need for bankruptcy court approval 
any eastern asset sales must be approved by the court eastern 
filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors march 9 
easterns unions wanted the airline sold as a single entity but 
texas air decided to sell the shuttle and about 14 billion in 
other eastern assets separately as part of a plan to rebuild as a 
smaller carrier 
richard seltzer an attorney for the pilots union said thursday 
the unions were happy with trumps ownership of the shuttle he 
also said they were continuing discussions with investor groups 
that have submitted formal bids for all of eastern including 
groups headed by former piedmont airlines chairman william howard 
and by chicago commodities trader joseph ritchie 
america west an aggressive phoenixbased regional carrier had 
offered 415 million for the shuttle and 336 million for 10 boeing 
757s alternatively america west offered to buy only the shuttles 
gates and landing slots at the three airports for 375 million 
lorenzo and trump renegotiated their original contract in april 
after the strike caused many eastern shuttle passengers to defect 
to the pan am corp shuttle the new agreement gave trump four four 
additional 727s for the same price 
trump has recognized easterns unions as representatives for 
employees of his shuttle while america west said it would not 
employ eastern workers if it bought the shuttle 
trump has signed labor contracts with pilots and flight 
attendants but not with members of the machinists union nobles 
said the machinists would be able to work for the trump shuttle 
initially without a contract

salomon brothers inc on thursday became the 
first investment firm sanctioned by the government for violating 
laws governing shortselling during the 1987 stock market crash 
without admitting or denying guilt salomon agreed to be 
censured to settle securities and exchange commission allegations 
regarding its short sales which are a type of speculation aimed at 
profiting from market declines 
salomon also agreed to establish procedures to prevent future 
shortselling violations said the sec which further alleged 
salomon willfully failed to promptly turn over its books for 
inspection salomon will not pay a fine 
salomon spokesman robert baker said the firm did not refuse to 
produce documents while salomon had difficulty responding as 
quickly as the sec wanted the sec was not denied a single 
document 
many wall streeters have said privately that shortselling 
aggravated the spectacular drop in stock prices on oct 19 1987 
when the dow jones industrial average tumbled 508 points but 
observers noted the salomon short sales cited by the sec were a 
drop in the bucket and did not effect events that day 
shortselling is the sale of borrowed stock by investors who 
believe the price of a stock will decline and that they will be 
able to profit by repaying their borrowings with cheaper shares 
short sale rules prohibit the strategy when a stock price already 
is falling 
i view this as a signal to the securities industry that they 
had better start to improve their compliance to our 
examinations said lawrence iason the secs new york regional 
administrator if they dont penalities in the future will be 
more severe 
the sec stated salomon made 70 short sales for its own account 
throughout the black monday crash the sales involved 300000 
shares of stock in 19 new york stock exchange companies 
iason could not comment on how much salomon profited from the 
sales the 19 companies whose stocks were involved werent 
identified 
salomons baker said there was no suggestion that any salomon 
brothers trader intentionally engaged in a transaction contrary to 
the shortsale rule or that any customer was disadvantaged in 
any way 
the sec said the shares salomon sold short carried a market 
value of 125 million baker said the firm traded 25 billion in 
securities on black monday 
on wall street market players shrugged off the sec action 
when its over well probably find out that everybody did it 
its not a big conspiracy its that everybody was having their 
heads handed to them said james cramer president of the money 
management firm cramer amp co 
iason could not comment on whether other firms were being 
investigated for similar violations 
james kirby chairman of los angelesbased capital guardian 
trust and a member of the presidential brady commission that 
studied the crash said it was very difficult to identify short 
sales on black monday 
i wouldnt assign it a high priority in terms of its 
contribution to an unbelievable event it was one of several 
things he said 
short selling was widely abused after the crash of 1929 by 
speculators who would gang up on a target company spreading lies 
about it to drive down the stock price 
such abuses led the nyse to implement the shortsale rule which 
theoretically prevents short sellers from intentionally depressing 
a stock price 
under the rule a short sale may be executed only in instances 
when the previous sale raised the stocks price or left it 
unchanged 
shortly after black monday the sec and the nyse began probing 
allegations that improper short selling may have contributed to the 
crash though ultimately they reached no determination 
while the shortselling allegations are serious it is 
particularly unusual for the sec to admonish a securities firm for 
failing to respond quickly to its investigation some speculated 
the sec may have been more concerned about that than about 
salomons trading violations 
to prevent further abuses salomon agreed that semiannual 
reviews of its shortsale compliance procedures be conducted by a 
senior internal auditor and an independent certified public 
accounting form or outside legal counsel

construction contracts surged by 9 percent in 
april reflecting a large increase in new housing construction an 
industry survey reported thursday 
the value of newly started construction contracts increased to 
an annual rate of 2568 billion last month up from 2361 billion 
in march the fw dodge group of mcgrawhill information services 
co reported 
residential building contracts rose 16 percent to an annual rate 
of 1261 billion while nonresidential building contracts which 
includes institutional commercial and industrial building 
increased 5 percent to 822 billion 
contracts for nonbuilding construction which comprises public 
works and utilities were little changed from marchs performance 
with an annual rate of 485 billion 
overall construction contracting for the first four months of 
the year has been off 2 percent to an unadjusted total of 7568 
billion from 7728 billion a year earlier 
much of the decrease was attributed to cutbacks in construction 
of office and apartment buildings partly because of higher 
interest rates that slowed borrowing demand 
it remains to be seen whether aprils surprising improvement 
will have staying power said george a christie fw dodges 
chief economist but it does show that the construction sector so 
far is taking this years higher interest rates in stride instead 
of collapsing into a downward spiral

central banks intervened against the dollar shortly after the

effective said kevin lawrie a vice president at the bank of 
boston many who are still bullish on dollar note that it is the 
central bank and not investors who are doing the selling

week the dollar should resume its upward momentum lawrie said

a strike by atampts union workers would have 
little impact on customers who dial longdistance directly but 
could slow operator service and bring company production of 
telecommunications equipment to a virtual halt 
union and company officials who commented thursday on the 
potential impact of a strike expressed hope a contract agreement 
would be reached by saturday nights deadline 
but the unions the communications workers of america and the 
international brotherhood of electrical workers also attacked 
anew american telephone amp telegraphs proposal to shift more health 
care costs to workers and it appeared increasingly unlikely an 
agreement would be reached by the deadline 
the unions have hinted they would not immediately call a strike 
and would rely instead on other tactics designed to pressure atampt 
into a settlement primarily a nationwide labor boycott that union 
officials contend could cut atampts daily longdistance volume by 8 
percent 
still a strike is expected if no agreement is reached within 
several days after the deadline 
if there is a strike both sides are in virtual agreement over 
the likely impact on atampt longdistance services which include 
about 80 million calls on an average business day and which 
generated 352 billion in 1988 revenues for the company 
technological advances should allow atampt to provide directdial 
longdistance services without significant interruptions 
however customers needing operator assistance for long distance 
would have to rely on management personnel filling in for operators 
who struck there are an estimated 21500 union workers in those 
jobs 
in addition 35500 technicians are represented by the unions 
and management would be called on to perform their jobs as well 
those tasks include installing and maintaining telecommunications 
equipment both within atampt offices and in businesses nationwide a 
company spokesman said atampt has management teams prepared to 
complete all major installations scheduled for the next five weeks 
also the nearly 37000 cwa and ibew factory workers in the 
united states would be expected to strike atampt plans to keep its 
us factories open but concedes that a widespread strike would 
essentially halt production of switching and transmission equipment 
its pretty difficult to run an assembly line if the picket 
lines are being honored on a high percentage basis atampt 
spokesman herb linnen said 
atampt is the leader in developing sensitive longdistance 
equipment and of late has been aggressively seeking to expand its 
global sales 
also 54000 union workers perform clerical sales 
administrative and other tasks including staffing atampt retail 
sales outlets in these areas a strike could have substantial 
impact on operations union officials said 
linnen refused to disclose how many management personnel were 
part of the emergency teams he said were being readied for a 
possible strike that planning is under way at atampts operations 
center in new jersey 
our objective is to provide the kind of highquality service 
that customers expect from atampt and we will press into service our 
experienced supervisory people to fill in if there is a work 
stoppage linnen said 
union officials essentially agreed with linnens account 
anytime you take 175000 people off the job it has an impact 
on that business said francine zucker spokeswoman for the 
communications workers of america but the unions dont have any 
illusions that we can shut atampt totally down 
ms zucker said during a 26day cwa strike in 1986 some of the 
managers who replaced operators proved they could do the job 
others did not they are forced to work double shifts in unfamiliar 
jobs and the added stress would have an impact on the quality of 
service 
atampt workers represented by the international brotherhood of 
electrical workers did not honor the cwa strike three years ago but 
are negotiating jointly with cwa for the first time this year 
three years ago atampt was able to keep its ibewrepresentented 
manufacturing plants open 
the negotiations which began in late march are hung up over 
atampts proposal to shift health care costs to workers the company 
says it spent 1 billion on health care last year and forecasts a 
10 percent annual increase for the next several years unless it 
redesigns its program 
the unions have attacked that proposal and also have termed 
inadequate atampts pay offer which included varying base wage 
increases for employees lump sum payments and the companys 
firstever profitsharing plan for the unionized workers 
the unions are expected to make a formal counteroffer on friday

the securities and exchange commission on 
thursday authorized exchanges to compete against one another in 
trading stock options a move designed to benefit customers but 
opposed by many of the exchanges 
the commission voted 50 to phase out current rules that 
restrict the trading of particular options to only one exchange 
beginning jan 22 1990 new options can be traded on more than one 
exchange as of jan 21 1991 existing options will be open for 
competition 
the unanimous vote came despite what commission members 
acknowledged was heavy lobbying by the exchanges for a delay 
after 12 years of study and consideration the time has come 
for the securities and exchange commission to adopt a rule that 
will move this process forward sec chairman david s ruder said 
stock options give the buyer the right to purchase or sell stock 
by a specific date at a designated price big institutional 
investors such as pension funds and insurance companies use options 
to hedge their portfolios protecting them against unexpected price 
swings individual investors sometimes speculate with options 
since 1980 the lucrative and exclusive right to trade new 
options on exchangelisted stocks has been awarded through a 
lottery option contracts on texaco stock for instance are traded 
only on the american stock exchange and options on ibm stock are 
traded exclusively on the chicago board of options exchange 
however since 1985 exchanges have competed against one another 
in trading options on overthecounter stocks a much smaller 
market than options for exchangelisted stocks 
the sec staff argues that competition has worked well for 
options on overthecounter stocks and similar competition for 
options on exchangelisted stocks would allow customers to use the 
exchange that does a more efficient and less costly job of managing 
trading 
the national association of securities dealers favors the 
change but most exchanges express varying degrees of reservation 
regional exchanges such as the philadelphia stock exchange and the 
pacific stock exchange fear they will lose business to larger 
competitors but even a larger market such as the american stock 
exchange which favors multiple listing argued for a more cautious 
approach 
ivers riley senior executive vice president at the american 
stock exchange said the sec should have authorized multiple 
listing only of new options opening up multiple trading of options 
already assigned to one exchange could prove to be too costly and 
disruptive for the exchanges at this time he said 
but richard g ketchum sec director of market regulation said 
he did not expect the new rules to produce dramatic shifts he said 
it would be difficult for an exchange to wrest trading of an 
established option away from the exchange that now trades it 
ketchum argued that multiple trading will give brokerage firms 
the leverage with exchanges to win more favorable trading terms for 
their customers 
also it will give the exchanges the incentive to develop an 
integrated electronic system that will allow brokers to route 
options business to whichever exchange is offering the best price 
at the moment he said the sec is issuing a white paper with 
advice on how to put together such a system and is inviting 
responses from the industry 
depending on the prospects for developing an integrated system 
commission member mary schapiro said she would consider requests 
this fall for delaying the start multiple options trading 
nicholas a giordano president of the philadelphia stock 
exchange said he feared multiple options trading without an 
integrated system would hurt customers by making it impossible to 
obtain the best price which he said could be assured if an option 
was traded on a single exchange 
he said members of congressional committees with oversight of 
the sec share his concern and he might ask them to hold hearings on 
the matter 
and noting that president bush this summer will likely replace 
a majority of the fivemember sec giordano said thursdays sec 
vote was tantamount to throwing a grenade into a room and 
leaving

if you were part of the throng at the woodstock 
music festival 20 years ago this summer life magazine wants to 
know 
more specifically life wants to know what happened to people 
who appeared in photographs in its special issue published a few 
weeks after that threeday celebration in august 1969 
lifes editors spent about 37000 for a fullpage advertisement 
that ran in the new york times earlier this week asking 
woodstock were you there 
the ad included a photo from the 1969 issue of a scraggly couple 
posing in a clearing among the trees during the festival and a 
coupon which readers were asked to complete and mail in if they 
were there a generation ago 
what do you remember about those three days of peace and love 
and mud did the experience change you life where are the people 
you went to woodstock with the coupon asks 
a promotional trick to boost circulation it wont hurt 
but lifes managing editor patricia ryan said she hopes the ad 
will attract as many as 20000 replies that her staff will use in 
assembling a special woodstock anniversary section for the august 
issue 
she said she hopes to run some of the old photos from the 1969 
issue next to current ones and include a few stories about what has 
happened to those folks since woodstock 
we were just sitting around looking at pictures and we started 
wondering where are they today are they bankers brokers junk 
bond salesmen farmers she said 
the woodstock music and arts festival which featured 
appearances by some of the biggest rock music performers of the 
day ran from aug 1517 on a farm in bethel ny the event which 
suffered soaking rainstorms and mud attracted an estimated half 
million people and became a symbol for a generation of how people 
can coexist peacefully in trying circumstances 
life a time inc publication wont be alone in marking the 
event 
rolling stone asked its own readers in january to send along 
their reminiscences about woodstock for inclusion in the bimonthly 
magazines issue that goes on sale aug 8 spokesman stu zakim said 
the magazine got more than 1000 replies 
mtv networks is planning special programming over the next 
several months ranging from periodic woodstock minutes to 
showing the threehour warner bros movie woodstock on its mtv 
music television and vh1 video hits one cable networks 
neither life with a monthly circulation of 18 million nor 
rolling stone with circulation of 1175 million increased their 
ad rates for the anniversary issues which the companies expect to 
be big sellers 
why did life wait until late may to ask for additional material 
for an issue that is expected to be completed in early july 
sometimes you get good ideas late said ms ryan

hog prices

allegheny international inc called off a 
merger agreement thursday that was to be the cornerstone of efforts 
to emerge from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 
the 747 million deal with donaldson lufkin amp jenrette inc a 
new york investment banking firm began unraveling last week when 
allegheny international disclosed its 1989 earnings would be less 
than anticipated officials said 
the deal was to be presented for approval thursday in us 
bankruptcy court 
instead allegheny international proposed a plan that would lift 
its key sunbeam corp subsidiary out of bankruptcy separately 
without an outside buyer creditors of the parent company would be 
repaid with funds left over after sunbeam is reorganized 
bruce mccullough allegheny internationals lead bankruptcy 
attorney told us bankruptcy judge joseph l cosetti the 
operating companies could emerge from chapter 11 in three to four 
months he said the plan would be easy to finance and no vote by 
sunbeam creditors would be required because all would be fully 
repaid 
as part of the plan chief executive officer oliver s travers 
jr and other top managers at the parent company would be replaced 
as major creditors have demanded 
but robert sable attorney for allegheny internationals 
unsecured creditors said his group and the companys bank lenders 
would oppose a reorganization involving only sunbeam 
the dlj contract which was struck in february included a 
clause allowing the banking firm to terminate the agreement if 
allegheny international failed to come within 95 percent of its 
operating goals at any time from february to september when its 
fiscal year ends officials said 
the merger agreement required allegheny internationals domestic 
operating companies to make an operating profit this fiscal year of 
at least 665 million but earnings projections now total only 61 
million to 62 million mccullough said 
allegheny international refused to accept the lower price of 
687 million dlj offered because of the shortfall officials said 
nicholas j sakallariadis allegheny internationals investment 
banking adviser told reporters the poor projections were a 
complete shock the most serious problems appeared to be at 
sunbeamosters iron business he said 
sakallariadis also said sales apparently were hurt when black amp 
decker corp which had a brief agreement earlier this year to 
acquire sunbeamoster indicated the sunbeam and oster lines would 
be discontinued 
the break between allegheny international and dlj was the 
second in january allegheny international called a halt to the 
deal when it learned dlj had secretly agreed to sell two divisions 
to a los angeles financier and a new york merchant banking group 
allegheny internationl then devised its own reorganization plan 
backed by equity holders and agreed to sell sunbeamoster to black 
amp decker its main competitor but that plan was quickly shelved 
sunbeam corp is comprised of allegheny internationals major 
operating units including almetlawnlite inc which manufactures 
patio furniture ostersunbeam appliance co which manufactures 
small appliances northern electric co which makes electric 
blankets and heating pads and sunbeam leisure products co which 
makes barbecue grills

the sale of eastern airlines northeast shuttle 
business to developer donald trump marks a critical juncture in 
easterns 2month path through a bruising strike and complex 
bankruptcy proceeding 
the 365 million sale to trump was approved formally thursday by 
us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland following eight months 
that saw court challenges to the deal by easterns unions and by a 
rival suitor 
the sale of the new yorkwashingtonboston shuttle means eastern 
wont be sold in its entirety a key goal of the airlines unions 
miamibased eastern filed for chapter 11 protection from its 
creditors march 9 five days after the start of a strike by 
machinists that has been supported by pilots and flight attendants 
and has forced a sharp curtailing of easterns flights 
the unions have vowed not to end their strike until the airline 
was sold or otherwise taken from the control of frank lorenzo 
chairman of easterns parent texas air corp 
the company has received several buyout proposals including a 
464 million plan from a group led by former baseball commissioner 
peter ueberroth but has not accepted any as viable 
in recent weeks easterns unions have had intensive discussions 
with investor groups interested in buying all of eastern two of 
those groups one headed by former piedmont airlines chairman 
william howard and the other by chicago commodities trader joseph 
ritchie have submitted formal bids to the bankruptcy court which 
must approve any sale of eastern or its assets 
david i shapiro the courtappointed examiner for eastern has 
dismissed those offers as not viable and challenged potential 
suitors to include at least 100 million in cash toward the 
purchase 
lorenzo has said the shuttle sale would give momentum to his own 
plan to rebuild eastern as a smaller carrier and sell another 14 
billion or so worth of eastern assets the bankruptcy court has not 
yet passed judgment on that plan although eastern has been making 
deals for the sale of aircraft landing slots and other assets in 
the event it is approved 
eastern also has been hiring and training new pilots to replace 
the strikers and says it plans to have enough when combined with 
pilots it expects to cross picket lines to meet the needs of the 
smaller carrier

the bush administrations hit list of unfair 
trading practices leaves autos off the list of products improperly 
excluded from the japanese market auto industry and congressional 
offices said thursday 
the automotive issue however will be raised later in 
negotiations with tokyo on trade barriers built into the japanese 
regulatory and marketing system officials said 
the list was drawn up as part of a provision in a trade bill 
passed last year allowing the government to name countries whose 
trade barriers are most harmful to us producers 
chrysler corp the nations third largest automaker said we 
are very encouraged that the administration has included 
distribution systems in japan on its list of structural practices 
which are key parts of the ongoing trade imbalance 
chrysler will over the next 12 months aggressively attempt 
to fulfill its commitment to break into the japanese market as we 
have in europe and taiwan the company said 
the list named japan india and brazil as nations with 
restrictive trade barriers 
the list of harmful trade practices in japan named satellites 
supercomputers and forest products as areas that had suffered from 
japanese trading practices and omitted the automotive sector which 
accounts for almost twothirds of the 55 billion us trade 
imbalance with japan 
the law requires the administration to identify the most harmful 
trade barriers and gives it 18 months to negotiate removal of the 
barriers 
if the talks fail to produce results the government can levy 
tariffs of up to 100 percent against selected imports from an 
offending country 
automobiles and automotive parts are not on the formal list and 
so would not come under the 18month rule 
the negotiations on structural barriers dont list automotive 
issues specifically but aides to sen donald riegle dmich said 
automotive issues would be addressed in trade negotiations with 
japan

the bush administration announced thursday 
that it had targeted trade barriers in japan brazil and india to 
meet a new us trade law a move that could mean huge tariffs 
against some foreign products 
the longawaited decision was announced by us trade 
representative carla hills 
she said the administration was citing japan for its refusal to 
buy us made satellites and supercomputers as well as its barriers 
on us lumber products 
mrs hills said the administration will immediately begin 
negotiations with the three countries to try to get the barriers 
removed so that any threatened us trade sanctions would be 
unnecessary 
while many foreign nations have bitterly attacked the onesided 
nature of the new us law mrs hills said she hopes all countries 
will understand that america is interested in opening markets 
rather than erecting trade barriers in this country 
this exercise is not intended to be offensive it is intended 
to carry out the law congress passed last year and we in the 
administration are sworn to uphold she told a packed news 
conference 
the 1988 omnibus trade act requires the administration to issue 
a sort of hit list identifying the trade barriers most harmful to 
american producers once that is done it has 18 months to 
negotiate the removal of the barriers if the talks are 
unsuccessful the government can levy tariffs of up to 100 percent 
against selected imports from an offending country 
officials said india would be cited for its restrictions on 
foreign investment and foreign insurance companies while brazil 
would be cited for its importlicensing practices 
the target countries and key congressional leaders were informed 
of the actions several hours before mrs hills news conference 
sen max baucus dmont and chairman of the senate finance 
subcommittee on international trade said he was pleased with the 
administrations initial response to the requirements in the trade 
law 
i think the administration deserves a passing grade they are 
stepping up to the problem baucus said this is a good start 
sen john danforth rmo called the action a very positive 
first step in utilizing a process which i hope will lead to more 
open world markets 
but there were critics rep dick gephardt dmo the author of 
an even tougher trade sanctions provision which was ultimately 
rejected by congress last year said bushs action was too timid 
and the administration had missed a golden opportunity to stand 
up for american workers and businesses 
nobuo matsunaga the japanese ambassador to the united states 
called the decision extremely regrettable and said any 
sanctions would be strongly opposed by his government 
in light of the good faith efforts that have been made the 
government of japan and the japanese people are greatly 
disappointed by this onesided decision matsunaga said in a 
statement there may well be some domestic backlash in japan 
which will make the resolution of the various problems even more 
difficult 
in addition to listing japan india and brazil for priority 
negotiations for flagrant trade barriers the administration put 
eight countries on a watch list because of their failure to 
provide protection for us patents and copyrights 
the eight countries placed on the watch list were brazil india 
mexico china south korea saudi arabia taiwan and thailand 
according to a fact sheet distributed to members of congress 
another 17 countries were cited as deserving special 
attention on the issue of copyright and patent protection with 
the administration promising to review progress in negotiations by 
nov 1 
those nations are argentina canada chile colombia egypt 
greece indonesia italy japan malaysia pakistan the 
philippines portugal spain turkey venezuela and yugoslavia 
however by citing no country as a priority violator of 
copyrights and patents the administration avoided triggering the 
strict timetables leading to possible sanctions 
in addition to naming japan as a priorty trade violator in three 
trade areas the administration also planned to begin negotiations 
with tokyo on socalled structural rigidities within japan which 
impede us sales baucus said 
the trade hit list has stirred anger among us allies who 
charge that the unilateral listing by the united states of a 
particular nation as an unfair trader violates the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade the pact which governs world trade 
some nations mounted extensive lobbying efforts to keep from 
being named to the list 
that lobbying effort worked for south korea taiwan and the 
12nation european community which were kept off despite having 
large trade surpluses with the united states 
congressional supporters of the new trade provision known as 
super 301 mounted their own campaign to make sure the 
administration named japan as a priority nation 
japan ran up a trade deficit with the united states of 52 
billion last year accounting for 44 percent of the total deficit 
of 1198 billion making it a prime target for inclusion on the 
trade list 
while south koreas deficit of 89 billion was among the 
largest of any nation officials from that country had stepped up 
efforts in the past weeks to reach agreements on the removal of 
various barriers against us products and the administration 
apparently took these concessions into account in making its 
determination 
the super 301 issue caused a deep split within bushs cabinet 
hills and commerce secretary robert mosbacher had urged an 
aggressive approach to carrying out the law saying failure to name 
several countries as flagrant trade violators risked a 
protectionist backlash in congress 
however michael boskin the presidents chief economic adviser 
and budget director richard darman countered that targeting japan 
americas closest ally in the pacific would be harmful to broader 
us interests 
the dispute went public earlier this month when boskin said in 
an appearance before a business group that us efforts to 
retaliate against its trading partners could spark a trade war and 
lead to a worldwide recession 
up until a decision made by president bush there was 
uncertainty over whether priority nations would be named or 
simply priority trade practices which would carry a lesser sting 
however those urging the naming of priority countries prevailed 
with bush 
rep ron wyden doregon said the administration acted only 
after heavy congressional pressure and it would be essential to 
keep up that pressure during the mandated negotiations 
now we have to be sure that the administration follows through 
by makin tough but reasonable demands and by getting some wins at 
the negotiating table wyden said
