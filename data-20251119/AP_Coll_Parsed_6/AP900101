irans government is intensifying a birth 
control program despite opposition from radicals because the 
countrys fastgrowing population is imposing strains on a 
struggling economy 
if the islamic republics government does not implement proper 
and swift plans for controlling population growth in iran future 
generations will definitely face severe social and economic 
problems tehrans kayhan international newspaper warned recently 
can we be proud of a nation of hungry moslems who have to beg 
the infidels of the world for charity declared mohammed yazdi a 
member of the 12member council of guardians a legislative 
watchdog body 
iran has one of the highest birth rates in the world between 
35 and 4 percent a year even in the middle east where soaring 
populations are the norm irans baby boom is fast outstripping 
development 
before the 1979 islamic revolution iran had about 35 million 
people lastmonth the governments chief statistician majid 
shamshidi said the population had reached 55 million 
experts estimate that by the year 2010 iran will have 140 
million people they warn that unless something is done soon to 
curb the birth rate and rapidly expand the economy the country 
faces a major social explosion 
while iran struggles to cope with its baby boom rival iraq is 
striving to expand its population to keep up with the iranians 
should the iraniraq war halted by an august 1988 ceasefire 
flare up again 
iraq has about 16 million people and president saddam hussein 
has declared increasing its birth rate a strategic duty he 
offers hefty financial incentives including cash grants and 
interestfree homepurchase loans 
iran launched a halfhearted birth control campaign last year 
with some religious leaders encouraging irans predominantly moslem 
population to have fewer children now irans spiritual leader 
ayatollah ali khamenei has declared that birth control is not 
unislamic although abortion is illegal 
the health ministry has announced it has set up centers in major 
cities to provide free contraceptives but these have been reported 
in short supply 
some newspapers say that unless more is done to get the message 
across the governmentprogram will have little impact on iranians 
who have traditionally favored large families 
the englishlanguage tehran times called last month for a media 
campaign to warn iranians of the danger of unrestrained population 
growth to bring this immense problem under control 
kayhan international declared this phenomenon should be 
seriously and properly dealt with using economic incentives the 
government should encourage iranian couples to have only two 
children 
one of president hashemi rafsanjanis most important priorities 
is expanding the economy to at least five times its current size to 
accommodate the anticipated population growth 
as it is western economists believe the economy plagued by bad 
management during the revolution and the 8year war with iraq is 
already severely stretched and needs massive investment just to 
cope with the current crisis 
rafsanjanis rivals oppose birth control they believe that the 
larger irans population the greater its chancesof becoming the 
undisputed leader of the moslem world 
by the year 2020 demographers estimate that the moslem 
population will be 25 billion double the present total and more 
than onequarter of the projected world population in the first 
quarter of the next century 
the third world which would account for more than 80 percent of 
the projected world population then would provide fertile ground 
for the islamic revolution the hardliners argue 
when a 1986 census showed 11 million iranians had been born 
since the revolution thenprime minister hussein musavi publicly 
rejoiced that they had been raised to the credo of death to 
america and allaho akbar or god isgreat 
the radical jomhuri islami daily noted recently amid a broadside 
of press criticism of birth control the problem is not the 
increasing population but the lack of policy and planning and in 
the end it is the unfortunate population that gets the blame 
rafsanjanis postwar development plan calls for building 12 
industrial cities in five yearsto help absorb the swelling 
population 
tehrans population has swollen to an estimated 8 million in 
recent years amid a widespread drift from the countryside to urban 
areas officialssay the city is bursting at the seams with 
housing water and electricity shortages trafficclogged streets 
and worsening pollution 
oilrich iran was able to feed itself 10 years ago but now has 
to import food worth 2 billion a year 
agricultural output has slumped severely in 1979 onethird of 
the population worked in that sector now government figures show 
its only onefifth

the effects of inflation the average retired workers social 
security check will rise from 541 to 566 the increase also 
applies to recipients of supplemental security income 
payroll tax the tax rate rises from 751 percent to 765 
percent employees will pay 765 for each 10000 of earnings 
subject to tax 
tax on selfemployed the rate rises to 1530 percent in 1989 
the rate technically was 1502 percent but the selfemployed got an 
automatic 2 percent tax credit so they paid 1302 percent they 
lose the 2 percent credit in 1990 but get to deduct half of social 
security taxes as a business expense

medicare premium elderly and disabled workers will be charged 
2860 a month in 1990 for supplementary medicare coverage down 
from 3190 in 1989 the decrease reflects the repeal of 
catastrophic healthcare benefits medicare premiums are deducted

earnings limit social security will allow beneficiaries ages 65 
through 69 to earn 9360 a year before reducing their benefits up 
from 8880 in 1989 those younger than 65 will be able to earn

four years ago it was imeldas shoes that 
caused the fuss now its elenas shoes 
theres something about political power that breeds 
extravagance a lesson reinforced by the trappings of wealth left 
behind last week by fleeing despots in both romania and panama 
when the marcoses were forced out of the philippines imelda 
marcos shoe collection enough for her to change daily for nine 
years without wearing the same pair twice was the talk of manila 
the pattern is much the same nowadays in bucharest where elena 
ceasescu boasted a wardrobe featuring shoes with diamondencrusted 
heels one day only to find herself in front of a firing squad 
before she could say hey wait a second 
in panama gen manuel antonio noriega also cut few corners in 
pursuit of the good life he had an array of houses and apartments 
in panama france and the dominican republic a collection of 
personal aircraft and three large pleasure yachts macho i 
macho ii and macho iii 
we live in a normal apartment just like every other 
citizen elena ceasescu told a military court during her closed 
trial 
thats not what romanias new authorities found when they turned 
up at the ceasescu residence instead of a normal apartment 
they discovered a 40room mansion crammed with valuable paintings 
exquisite fountains and goldplated fixtures in the bathrooms 
every room had a television and a videocasette player 
we had no palaces the palaces belong to the people the 
ousted president nicolae ceasescu told the military tribunal 
some of the ceausescus diversions seemed tame compared with 
noriegas the new romanian authorities came across english 
instruction tapes tennis courts and a volleyball court in the 
presidential compound 
noriega on the other hand was discovered to have red underwear 
to ward off evil spirits paraphernalia for the practice of voodoo 
a collection of pornographic pictures and a sizeable quantity of 
cocaine 
few absolute rulers seem to have been able to resist the lure of 
highliving when mrs marcos fled the malacanang palace in manila 
in 1986 investigators dicovered a bill for an evening gown and six 
silk dresses that came to 107000 roughly 19 times marcos annual 
presidential salary of 5700 
former haitian president jeanclaude duvalier who fled the same 
month as marcos was worth an estimated 400 million 
the late nicaraguan president anastasio somoza built up a 
fortune worth about 100 million through investments in 
prostitution gambling and construction according to walter 
lafeber a historian 
the dominican republics rafael trujillo controlled 111 
companies at the time of his death in 1961 and was worth about 500 
million says biographer robert crassweller trujillo once 
reportedly spent 80000 on a gown for his daughter angelita its 
train was 75 feet long 
the ranks of showy strongmen have diminished lately with the 
accelerating trend toward democracy emperor bokassa i who spent 
20 million on his coronation 1976 is a dim memory to his former 
subjects in the central african republic 
but one highliver who still survives is mobutu sese seko 
president of zaire a prous stalwart in central africa whose 
worth is believed to range between 3 billion and 5 billion he 
has a number of houses abroad and has 11 palaces in zaire alone 
next to the sultan of brunei though mobutu deals in small 
change the sultan with an estimated worth of 28 billion has a 
palace with 1788 rooms including more than 200 bathrooms the 
ceasescus existence almost seemed pedestrian by comparison

here is the text of president bushs televised 
new years message to the soviet union 
on behalf of the american people my wife barbara and my 
family i bring you our warmest greetings 
a new year is dawning around the world the first year of the 
last decade of the 20th century and as the world looks back to 
nine decades of war of strife of suspicion let us also look 
forward to a new century and a new millennium of peace freedom 
and prosperity 
of course there are no maps to lead us where we are going to 
this new world of our own making we can find our way only through 
cooperation beginning with a candid dialogue it is in pursuit of 
such a dialogue that i met your president mikhail gorbachev near 
the islandnation of malta let me share with you some of the 
matters we discussed 
first we agreed to redouble our efforts to diminish the 
horrible threat from weapons of mass destruction and to pursue 
with other nations an agreement to reduce conventional forces in 
europe 
second we talked about ways we can end regional conflicts and 
alleviate the terrible toll in human suffering they bring 
third i want to assure you as i did your president that the 
west seeks no advantage from the extraordinary changes underway in 
the east 
we talked about the magnificent efforts of the people of eastern 
europe to find a free and democratic future and i told your 
president that i support the dynamic process of reform in the 
soviet union we will work together to reduce barriers to trade 
investment and the free movement of goods and ideas 
in these ways and as your economic reforms take place the 
entry of the soviet union into the global market can be advanced 
an historic goal that once achieved can improve the life of every 
soviet citizen 
but it is our belief that lasting peace and prosperity comes 
from a respect for human rights and the sharing of democratic 
values that are deeply rooted in the human spirit your own leo 
tolstoy said that if our hearts are empty no law or political 
reform can fill them the real law lives within our hearts 
these values are not exclusively american or western they are 
not the possession of any people or any domain they belong to all 
men and women through all time and in all places they are the 
inalienable rights of man 
of course much remains to be done but the progress of the past 
year gives me confidence that we are heading in the right 
direction in this president gorbachev has been a good partner in 
peace 
given the warntorn history of this century we should redouble 
our efforts to forge a new century of peace and freedom our 
nations have produced abraham lincoln leo tolstoy martin luther 
king and andrei sakharov 
we have persevered as allies in a terrible war the challenges 
we face today are no less daunting but with the goodwill and 
determination on both sides i am confident our two peoples will be 
equal to the task 
thank you god bless you and have a happy new year

a demolition worker was buried under several 
tons of rubble when seven stories of a parking garage partially 
collapsed in the downtown area 
authorities identified the trapped worker as basilio barrios 
36 and said rescue crews prepared to use an 80ton crane to dig 
him from 10 to 20 feet of rubble 
two other workers escaped on their own and a third was freed a 
short time later by district of columbia firemen authorities said 
battalion chief bill embrey of the dc fire department said 
we will stay here as long as it takes to get him out 
fire officials worked carefully to rescue barrios but estimated 
the operation will take time because the building is unstable and 
could collapse more investigators are looking into the matter 
authorities said the workers were performing routine demolition 
work on the second floor of the parking garage two stories had 
been previously removed from the ninestory structure 
barrios was believed to be cutting through a length of steel on 
the second floor of the garage when several stories of concrete 
began crashing down authorities said there is little hope that he 
survived 
after the building collapse workers brought in a police dog to 
help search for barrios body the dog recovered the hose to the 
torch barrios had been holding officials said 
a relative at the scene said barrios came to the united states 
about a year ago from guatemala to make money for his wife and five 
children he left behind barrios had planned to return to guatemala 
in june the relative said

government plans to charge manuel 
antonio noriega with murder and other common crimes may break a 
weekold deadlock between washington and the vatican over custody 
of the deposed strongman 
president bush says he wants noriega behind bars in the united 
states to stand trial on drug trafficking charges panamas 
president guillermo endara sworn as us troops invaded to oust 
noriega has indicated hes not too eager to have the military 
ruler turned asylumseeker remain in panama 
but the vatican in whose embassy noriega sought sanctuary dec 
24 and greeted the new year has made it clear it is reluctant to 
turn out the general until all the niceties of diplomacy and 
international law are fulfilled 
up to now the main stumbling block has been the vaticans 
insistence that it cannot hand over noriega to the united states 
which it considers an occupying power in panama 
it says it considers its embassy accredited to deal only with 
the panamanian government which it insists has not made a formal 
request for custody of noriega 
it has similarly indicated there are the centuriesold 
traditions of political asylum and church sanctuary to safeguard 
both of which could be obviated in the case of common crimes with 
the vatican having the privilege of deciding 
so far the vatican has granted noriega temporary asylum and it 
has not ruled out turning him over to panama saying in a statement 
saturday it did not intend to block the course of justice 
regarding a person accused of serious crimes 
in what appeared to be an attempt to break the deadlock 
attorney general roglio cruz announced sunday that endaras 
government was preparing to charge noriega with the murder of 10 
officers of the now disbanded defense forces 
the officers were all involved in an oct 3 coup attempt against 
noriega and were tortured and executed after surrendering cruz 
told a news conference 
later sunday about 200 people gathered two blocks from the 
vatican mission which is surrounded by us troops and armor 
and stood in silent vigil holding lighted candles they said they 
came to pray that noriega be brought to justice 
cruz told reporters that the government of endara who was 
elected in may in balloting nullified by noriega would request the 
ousted generals custody tuesday or before 
and yes there is evidence to implicate noriega directly 
with the officers deaths cruz said in response to a question 
even panamas roman catholic clergy wants noriega brought to 
justice a dozen bishops have written pope john paul ii urging that 
he be handed over for trial in panama or the united states and 
calling him the author of abominable crimes 
as cruz told it a preliminary investigation showed that during 
the coup attempt forces led by maj moises giroldi chief of 
noriegas security company in the defense headquarters captured 
noriega 
noriega negotiated with his captors and eventually loyalist 
forces attacked the defense forces headquarters forcing the rebels 
to surrender noriegas regime announced the next day that 10 of 
the rebels including giroldi had been killed in the fighting 
the 10 were executed after they surrendered in a place away 
from the site where they gave up cruz said 
when the coup failed giroldi and the others were promised 
personal safety but then he was taken by helicopter to the base at 
the airport and then from there to the military base at tinajitas 
where he was tortured shot in the kneecaps and elbows and then 
shot to death a panamanian officer involved in the investigation 
said 
the officer who insisted on anonymity told the associated 
press that a lieutenant who at one time shoved noriega into a 
truck at the beginning of the coup had his hands cut off and then 
he was shot 
another officer capt nicasio lorenzo whose body was returned 
to his family with a report saying he had died of asphyxiation 
also was tortured they put a hood over his head and then beat 
him and choked him until he died the source said 
cruz said indictments were also are being prepared against the 
noriegadominated electoral council for trying to block the 
orderly renewal of government powers by illegally annulling the 
may 7 national elections noriega may be involved in that one too 
although he was only the defense forces chief at the time 
noriega wielded absolute power behind the scenes international 
observers said the elections were annulled when returns showed 
endaras slate won by a 3to1 margin 
the new government was to have taken office sept 1 along with a 
new national legislature but noriega had the old legislature name 
francisco rodriguez a crony of his provisional president before 
that date 
and then less than a week before the dec 20 invasion noriega 
had himself named by a rump legislature made up to municipal mayors 
maximum leader with virtually absolute power saying panama was 
in a state of war with the united states

us courts need more judges particularly in 
border regions burdened with a heavy load of drug cases says chief 
justice william h rehnquist 
from the federal law enforcement perspective the war on drugs 
will fail if the judiciary is not given the judgeships necessary to 
do the job the supreme court chief said sunday in his annual 
yearend report on the federal court system 
some courts especially in border states are approaching the 
outer limits of caseload and fatigue from handling drugrelated 
cases he said noting that one in four criminal cases handled by 
the federal courts is drugrelated 
rehnquist urged congress to take immediate action to create 
the 59 additional trial judgeships and 16 more appellate judgeships 
requested last october by the us judicial conference the 
policymaking arm of the federal court system rehnquist heads the 
conference 
to date congress has authorized 575 federal trial judgeships 
and 168 appellate judgeships no new judgeship has been created 
since 1984

at carlos fosters stable in the bronx young 
cowfolk looking to rope and ride dont just horse around they 
earn their spurs by staying in school and away from the 
druginfested streets 
the happy trails stables is where foster 67 and his hired 
hands in the urban western riding program teach innercity youths 
trickriding calfroping and much more 
i use the horse as a substitute for drugs with the horse i 
can stop them from playing hooky and from doing drugs foster 
said recently from atop his palomino santiago 
happy trails stables isnt a ranch of wideopen spaces the din 
of passing traffic and the shadows of adjacent housing projects 
intrude on the bucolic goings on 
within the stables the tradition of the old west takes 
precedence 
youths ranging in age from 8 to 20 learn the history of the 
cowboy they brush the sweat and dirt from the horses coats walk 
them clean their stables ride them in a corral 
im giving these children the opportunity to see what lies 
beyond the pressures which led him or her to substance abuse or 
away from school foster said 
foster was busting broncos at age 5 for a quarter a shot in 
dantes orientees cuba hes lived in new york for nearly 30 years 
working waiting and cleaning jobs in the city and skipping out west 
on weekends to ride the rodeo 
hes a tall thin cowpoke with a thick white moustache and a 
crop of white hair that is always covered with a cowboy hat he 
speaks with a deep voice his swarthy face breaking up each time he 
laughs 
the inspiration for the urban western riding program was 
fosters successful 13year battle against his sons heroin 
addiction he felt the skills of the wild west could help protect 
kids from urban horrors 
he rented horses and charged for weekend riding lessons raising 
enough money to rent the corral of the happy trails stables he now 
has about 200 students a year 
two years ago harry taylor 23 was a cocaine addict living in 
a pony trailer behind the stables until he hit bottom and asked 
foster for a job 
i owe everything to carlos because he took me under his wing 
and taught me that drugs and horses dont mix so i quit cold 
turkey to keep up with this job said taylor 
taylor is now one of the programs instructors and has competed 
in bronco busting in several rodeos 
this year foster and the city board of education cosponsored a 
curriculum for truant students from intermediate and junior high 
schools in the bronx borough of new york each week 120 students 
visit the stable for a threehour riding lesson 
diana ianuzzi a teacher and counselor at intermediate school 80 
in the bronx said she has a hard time keeping the students calm 
when the bell rings and its time to board the bus 
its an incentive to bring up grades and enjoy school in my 
classes i can actually say within these few weeks ive seen an 
improvement she said 
at the end of the school year 50 of the children will ride 
beside more than 100 professional cowboys at opening ceremonies of 
a bronx rodeo 
foster is retired from trick riding and calf roping but he 
intends to use western traditions to help children for as long as 
it works 
if i could stop two or five kids a year from ruining their 
lives thats all i want to do the rest of my life

seattle houston and atlanta

more than three hours after the 707 pm launch officials

technical problem and eight times by strong high altitude winds 
the wind didnt pose a problem sunday night and the countdown 
proceeded without a hitch to an ontime liftoff 
the most powerful us commercial rocket carried into space the 
14700pound jcsat2 and the 3230pound skynet 4 satellites 
jcsat2 will complete a twosatellite japanese domestic network

alf and et may have liked the 
idea but few people on earth were willing to dig deep enough to 
build a 25 million welcoming station for visitors from outer space 
thomas l weber 51 said financial problems caused him to close 
the office that was the center for promoting the project 
we got tens of thousands of letters but we couldnt even 
afford postage to answer the mail weber said 
i guess if people had slipped 5 or 10 or 20 in each 
envelope wed still be operating he said 
his plan called for the welcoming station to provide a safe 
landing area that would accommodate visitors from other planets 
the site he selected is on hilly farmland near elmwood in western 
wisconsin 
however the groundswell of financial support he expected from 
those around the nation who believe in ufos never materialized 
weber said he spent about 20000 running the site center office 
about half came out of my own pocket he said i and 
another person were the major contributors

women are beginning to count more in 
american mathematics according to a university of massachusetts 
professor who says they earned nearly a quarter of all the math 
doctorates in the last school year 
it should dispel the notion once and for all that mathematics 
is a mans game said professor edward connors who conducts an 
annual survey of the doctorates issued in the field for the 
american mathematical society and the mathematical association of 
america 
the new female doctorates with median starting salaries of 
30500 even made about 500 a year more than their male 
classmates connors said 
in 198788 about 21 percent of mathematics phds went to 
women he said in 1989 it was a little over 24 percent with 313 
men and 98 women earning doctorates in math 
connors said that the percentage rise was fueled both by 
increasing numbers of women going on to graduate work in math and 
the declining numbers of american men in the field 
for the third straight year us colleges granted more 
doctorates in math to foreign students than they did to american 
citizens out of the 904 doctorates issued in the 198889 school 
year 46 percent went to us citizens 
that was slightly better than in the previous years figure of 
45 percent but the number of doctorates earned by americans has 
been declining since the 197677 school year when 76 percent of 
the 901 issued went to us citizens according to the survey 
although women have made up about half of the bachelors degrees 
awarded in math for more than a decade traditionally they have not 
gone on to advanced degrees he said 
its hard to understand because the world of mathematics 
doesnt have the artificial barriers to women and minorities of 
some of the other physical sciences where much of the work is done 
in research groups connors said mathematicians are by and 
large a bunch of loners and the rest of the world regards them all 
men and women as sort of different 
betty m vetter who conducts surveys on women and minorities in 
the sciences for the american association for the advancement of 
science said its too soon to tell whether the 1989 statistics 
signal a trend 
however she said the higher salaries that women mathematicians 
received most likely were a glitch 
the only field where women have been able to hold a slight 
edge in salaries over men has been engineering and thats only at 
the starting level ms vetter said the real salary problems 
occur later on because women still do not have the same 
opportunities for advancement as men

four years ago it was imeldas shoes that 
caused the fuss now its elenas shoes 
theres something about political power that breeds 
extravagance a lesson reinforced by the trappings of wealth left 
behind last week by fleeing despots in both romania and panama 
when the marcoses were forced out of the philippines imelda 
marcos shoe collection enough for her to change daily for nine 
years without wearing the same pair twice was the talk of manila 
the pattern is much the same nowadays in bucharest where elena 
ceausescu boasted a wardrobe featuring shoes with diamondencrusted 
heels one day only to find herself in front of a firing squad 
before she could say hey wait a second 
in panama gen manuel antonio noriega also cut few corners in 
pursuit of the good life he had an array of houses and apartments 
in panama france and the dominican republic a collection of 
personal aircraft and three large pleasure yachts macho i 
macho ii and macho iii 
we live in a normal apartment just like every other 
citizen elena ceausescu told a military court during her closed 
trial 
thats not what romanias new authorities found when they turned 
up at the ceausescu residence instead of a normal apartment 
they discovered a 40room mansion crammed with valuable paintings 
exquisite fountains and goldplated fixtures in the bathrooms 
every room had a television and a videocasette player 
we had no palaces the palaces belong to the people the 
ousted president nicolae ceausescu told the military tribunal 
some of the ceausescus diversions seemed tame compared with 
noriegas the new romanian authorities came across english 
instruction tapes tennis courts and a volleyball court in the 
presidential compound 
noriega on the other hand was discovered to have red underwear 
to ward off evil spirits paraphernalia for the practice of voodoo 
a collection of pornographic pictures and a sizeable quantity of 
cocaine 
few absolute rulers seem to have been able to resist the lure of 
highliving when mrs marcos fled the malacanang palace in manila 
in 1986 investigators dicovered a bill for an evening gown and six 
silk dresses that came to 107000 roughly 19 times marcos annual 
presidential salary of 5700 
former haitian president jeanclaude duvalier who fled the same 
month as marcos was worth an estimated 400 million 
the late nicaraguan president anastasio somoza built up a 
fortune worth about 100 million through investments in 
prostitution gambling and construction according to walter 
lafeber a historian 
the dominican republics rafael trujillo controlled 111 
companies at the time of his death in 1961 and was worth about 500 
million says biographer robert crassweller trujillo once 
reportedly spent 80000 on a gown for his daughter angelita its 
train was 75 feet long 
the ranks of showy strongmen have diminished lately with the 
accelerating trend toward democracy emperor bokassa i who spent 
20 million on his coronation 1976 is a dim memory to his former 
subjects in the central african republic 
but one highliver who still survives is mobutu sese seko 
president of zaire a prous stalwart in central africa whose 
worth is believed to range between 3 billion and 5 billion he 
has a number of houses abroad and has 11 palaces in zaire alone 
next to the sultan of brunei though mobutu deals in small 
change the sultan with an estimated worth of 28 billion has a 
palace with 1788 rooms including more than 200 bathrooms the 
ceausescus existence almost seemed pedestrian by comparison

emerging from selfimposed exile 
former president chun doohwan appeared before parliament but his 
answers to questions on corruption during his tenure were drowned 
out by angry shouting lawmakers 
during sundays hearings which were broadcast to the nation 
the disgraced expresident refused to make an outright apology as 
opposition parties have demanded but said he would take moral 
responsibility for wrongdoing under his rule 
he has denied any personal corruption but 48 of his relatives 
and associates have been convicted of embezzlement and other crimes 
i didnt do anything wrong chun said 
its a lie its a lie one opposition lawmaker shouted as 
chun denied almost all charges of corruption power abuse and 
misdeeds 
the testimony which lasted more than 12 hours was interrupted 
repeatedly by shouting matches that forced adjournments and a 
virtual freeforall involving about two dozen legislators 
a melee broke out after opposition legislators angrily accused 
chun of lying about his involvement in the crushing of a 1980 civil 
uprising in the city of kwangju about 200 people died and 1500 
were wounded in the uprising which was suppressed by the military 
chun was a top general at the time and became president the same 
year with military backing 
after the hearing chun returned to the buddhist temple where he 
has lived in selfimposed exile since leaving office in 1988 after 
a sevenyear term marred by charges of corruption human rights 
abuses and misconduct 
aides said he would not come back to testify 
chun was forced to agree to democratic president elections in 
1987 after months of antigovernment protests his handpicked 
successor roh was elected dec 17 1987 in south koreas first 
direct presidential election in 16 years

corazon aquino has made the most 
extensive cabinet reshuffle of her presidency less than a month 
after a failed coup changing such key posts as finance justice 
and military affairs 
her spokesman adolfo azcuna claimed the changes announced 
sunday had not been prompted by the coup attempt the most serious 
of her nearly fouryear tenure but by the same reasons perhaps 
that precipitated the coup 
public criticism had been directed at the departments of 
transport education agriculture and agrarian reform whose 
secretaries were among those replaced in the shakeup 
it was the most sweeping cabinet revamp since mrs aquino took 
office in the february 1986 uprising that toppled the late 
president ferdinand marcos 
the thrust of these changes is the need always to adjust to 
new situations to assure improved delivery of services to our 
people mrs aquino said in a nationally televised statement 
in her announcement mrs aquino said jose cuisia administrator 
of the social security system would take over as central bank 
governor 
retired maj gen mariano adalem was named presidential adviser 
on military affairs replacing retired maj gen jose magno adalem 
was also appointed acting chief of the national intelligence 
coordinating agency 
there had been widespread criticism of the intelligence 
services failure to predict the dec 19 coup attempt in which at 
least 113 people were killed and more than 500 injured 
mrs aquino retained fidel ramos as defense secretary despite 
demands by mutineers that he be replaced ramos has crushed all six 
coup attempts while serving as military chief of staff and later 
defense secretary 
also retained was foreign secretary raul manglapus who was 
widely criticized for sloppy management of a department where 
former marcos supporters hold key positions 
mrs aquino named jesus estanislao former economic planning 
secretary to be secretary of finance replacing vicente jayme 
jayme who underwent cardiac surgery this year was appointed 
presidential adviser on economic and financial affairs 
in other changes 
labor secretary franklin drilon as secretary of justice 
replacing sedfrey ordonez who was named ambassador to the united 
nations 
senen bacani a former agribusiness executive as secretary of 
agriculture replacing carlos domingez who resigned 
isidro carino a university president as secretary of 
education replacing lourdes quisumbing who resigned 
mrs aquino reorganized her cabinet after coup attempts in 
november 1986 and august 1987 but the changes failed to satisfy 
military dissidents or lead to significant improvements in her 
administration

excitement about the holidays has helped 
11yearold kimberly mays cope with the news that she and another 
girl apparently were switched at birth the man who raised her said 
i dont think kims been terribly bothered with the thoughts 
of anything over the past few weeks robert mays said 
shes been very excited about christmas told the sarasota 
heraldtribune in a story published sunday kids dont let a lot 
get between them and santa claus 
it was mays first interview since he faced a roomful of 
reporters five weeks ago to discuss his reaction to genetic tests 
that revealed kimberly is not his biological daughter 
under an agreement reached between mays and ernest and regina 
twigg of sebring kimberlys biological parents the fifthgrader 
is allowed to remain with mays mays had refused to allow the 
genetic tests of his only child for more than a year until the 
twiggs agreed to drop any custody claim of kimberly if tests 
revealed she was their daughter 
robert and barbara mays biological daughter arlena who was 
raised by the twiggs died in 1988 at the age of 9 of a congenital 
heart defect barbara mays died of cancer in 1981 
theres been virtually no discussion none whatsoever about 
the twiggs with me since the day after the blood tests came back 
he said 
mays said he has tried to impress on kimberly that she can take 
as much time as she needs to sort out her feelings 
i think considering everything shes been through shes 
doing remarkably well for an 11yearold child said mays who 
has shielded kimberly from reporters throughout the ordeal 
mays said hes been too busy as a roofing supply salesman and 
preparing for the holidays to make any decision about whether to 
sue hardee memorial hospital in wauchula where kimberly and arlena 
were born and the switch apparently took place 
the twiggs initially filed a 100 million lawsuit against the 
hospital but have withdrawn that lawsuit and filed another one 
seeking unspecified damages 
hospital officials who denied any wrongdoing have been mum 
ever since the test results were disclosed 
mays also said there has not been enough time to schedule 
psychological tests of kimberly to determine whether she would 
suffer from meeting the twiggs and their children 
the twiggs say they would like to get to know kimberly and 
introduce her to her brothers and sisters who range in age from 21 
to 6 but not if psychologists hired by both families agree that it 
would be traumatic for the young girl 
the twiggs also have agreed not to establish contact with her 
and will refrain from sending birthday cards or christmas presents 
until the psychological evaluations are complete

president mikhail s gorbachev says hes just had 
the toughest year of his tenure one of strikes ethnic violence 
and economic strain but thinks the 1990s could be extraordinarily 
peaceful and harmonious 
speaking in his annual new years television address to the 
soviet people gorbachev also made it clear that he disagrees with 
british prime minister margaret thatchers yearend conclusion that 
socialism has failed 
the necessity to combine socialism with democracy has again 
been vigorously reaffirmed in the dramatic events that occurred in 
berlin sofia prague and bucharest gorbachev said in the speech 
just before midnight sunday 
communists in east germany czechoslovakia romania and poland 
were forced by prodemocracy movements to give up their absolute 
power in 1989 and communists in bulgaria are trying to stem public 
protests with reforms 
gorbachev wished eastern europeans success in their 
revolutionary renewal and promised soviet solidarity 
the postwar division of the continent recedes into the past 
he said the cold war is ending and people now speak of his idea 
of a common european home as a realistic prospect instead of 
fantasy he said 
the 1990s could become the most fruitful period in the history 
of civilization he predicted if people concentrate on 
solidarity cooperation and accord 
he was clearly appealing for unity not only internationally but 
domestically 
in 1989 the soviet union was riven by calls for secession and 
by ethnic strife that killed hundreds of people his new years 
wish was that 1990 pass under the watchword of mutual 
understanding and consolidation 
the past year has been the most difficult of his tenure said 
gorbachev who came to power in march 1985 but no matter how 
difficult 1989 was we are seeing it off not only with a sense of 
bitterness but also as a year in which much indispensable work was 
accomplished 
the year brought the soviet unions first genuinely free 
elections its first congress parliamentary experience and a 
rapid rise in the democratic culture of the people gorbachev 
said 
last springs elections to the congress of peoples deputies 
were the first contested elections in soviet history and the 
balloting produced true competition in many districts however in 
some areas communist bureaucrats kept an iron grip on the 
electoral process 
gorbachev said better times lie ahead 
it is not easy for seeds to grow in our soil he said 
apparently referring obliquely to democracy 
but if they survive and strike root and we must see they do 
they will yield rich fruit for the entire country and every 
person 
the soviet leader recorded a separate new years message for the 
american people that was to be broadcast on us television today 
in his message to the soviet people president bush pledged to 
work with gorbachev to reduce barriers to trade investment and 
the free movement of goods and ideas so the soviet unions 
entry into the global market can be advanced

a south wind frustrated efforts to clean a spill 
of about 2000 gallons of marine diesel oil in elliott bay 
the source of the spill spotted friday night was not known 
said coast guard petty officer michael cobb 
crews collected about 500 gallons of oil by midsunday but wind 
kept the remainder under a pier officials said the oil could be 
cleaned up when the winds abate 
the spill blackened the shoreline but no seabirds or mammals 
appeared affected 
because the origin of the spill was unknown the estimated 
60000 to 75000 cost of the cleanup will be paid by a federal 
fund

with the government shaken by the firing of a 
cabinet minister for alleged contacts with the plo rival political 
leaders negotiated with small parties today to try to form a new 
governing coalition 
in the occupied lands the army confined at least 11 million 
palestinians to their homes in an attempt to prevent violent 
outbreaks today is the 25th anniversary of the founding of plo 
chief yasser arafats mainstream fatah movement 
curfew orders banning people from going out were in effect for 
the entire gaza strip and four of the largest cities in the west 
bank 
the cabinet crisis was triggered by prime minister yitzhak 
shamir of the rightwing likud bloc who on sunday handed a letter 
of dismissal to science minister ezer weizman of the centerleft 
labor party 
shamir accused the 65yearold former defense minister and 
fighter pilot of meeting plo officials and exchanging messages with 
arafat in violation of government policy 
weizman has not directly commented on the accusations but he 
said in repeated radio and television interviews that other israeli 
officials were also involved in at least indirect contacts with the 
plo 
labor headed by vice premier shimon peres responded to 
shamirs move by threatening to leave the government unless the 
prime minister rescinds the letter which formally goes into effect 
tuesday 
both shamir and peres held meetings today with leaders of four 
religious parties each aiming to persuade the small parties to 
join a new coalition to replace the current likudlabor government 
the religious parties have 12 seats in the 120member 
parliament giving them significant clout in deciding whether the 
39seat labor or 40seat likud could rule separately along with 
right or leftwing allies 
some labor and likud leaders sought a compromise that would 
leave shamirs yearold government intact an aide to shamir said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
defense minister yitzhak rabin of labor said on israel radio 
that he saw the continuation of the national unity government as 
the need of the hour 
rabin added that the dispute over whether israel should speak to 
the plo is not a subject worth breaking up the government 
environmental affairs minister roni milo of likud also said i 
believe the prime minister is interested in seeing the government 
last 
one compromise idea under discussion was to leave weizman in the 
cabinet as a ministerwithoutportfolio while removing him from 
the 12member decisionmaking inner cabinet israeli media 
reported 
if no agreement is reached the 26member government could fall 
in a parliamentary vote of no confidence scheduled for later in the 
week at the urging of leftwing parties labor was reportedly 
considering supporting these motions 
shamir declined to be specific about weizmans alleged meetings 
with the plo saying only that the minister had passed messages to 
arafat and met other plo officials 
israeli media said the source of shamirs information was the 
shin bet israels secret security agency 
shamir claimed in a nationwide television broadcast sunday that 
these actions undermined his attempts to get middle east peace 
talks underway without plo involvement 
israeli media indicated shamir was angered by alleged contacts 
with plo figures via an israeli arab physician ahmed tibi who has 
reportedly visited tunis 
the yediot ahronot daily said weizman had also been trying to 
arrange a meeting with arafat 
other reports said weizman had met nabil shaath of arafats 
fatah faction and geneva plo representative nabil amlawi 
rabin confirmed on the radio that weizman had conveyed some 
messages at least indirectly to the plo to persuade the 
organization to accept peace proposals of us secretary of state 
james a baker iii 
baker has called for direct israelipalestinian talks as a step 
toward bringing about elections proposed by israel in the occupied 
territories

a cacophony of drums saxophones and 
firecrackers pierced the air early today and fireworks illuminated 
the berlin wall as tens of thousands of people from east and west 
celebrated new years together 
tens of thousands poured in both directions through the newly 
opened brandenburg gate each hour and thousands more scaled the 
wall and tumbled into the other germany as border guards watched 
with amusement 
in a revival of the citywide street party that erupted when the 
berlin wall opened nov 9 young people scrambled atop the divide 
to take in the scene on both sides bobbing and rocking to the 
erratic rhythm of the concert without conductor at brandenburg gate 
hammers clanged against chisels as hundreds mined the wall for 
souvenirs 
after midnight some scaffolding supporting an outdoor 
projection screen near brandenburg gate collapsed under the weight 
of revelers killing a man and injuring 135 people east germanys 
official adn news agency reported seventyseven of them were 
hospitalized it said 
adn said drunks and a carpet of broken glass from champagne 
bottles hindered rescue workers 
in other border areas police police arrested 68 neonazi 
activists overnight after they tried to stage illegal 
demonstrations authorities in both german states had formed joint 
patrols to prevent disturbances threatened by rightwing radicals 
a west berlin counterculture group had appealed to berliners on 
both sides of the crumbling divide to bring musical instruments and 
inspiration to the battlescarred gate for a concert to fete the 
first new years in four decades that germans have celebrated 
together 
we just wanted to be here for it its fantastic said 
21yearold kerry bundgaard of phoenix as her father videotaped the 
scene 
the wall is open for the first time in my life we want to 
celebrate along with everyone else said hansjuergen witfeld 
who traveled from the ruhr valley city of dortmund with eight 
friends to spend the holiday in cold and misty berlin 
at midnight fireworks filled the midnight sky over brandenburg 
gate the sootstained monument was swathed in smoke as young 
people from around the world clamored atop the surrounding wall and 
scaled even the tarnished bronze chariot that crowns the columned 
gate 
since east german authorities began punching holes in the 
graffitisplattered concrete that had severed berlin since 1961 
the wall has become more a bridge than a barrier 
tour buses from throughout europe shuttled thousands to the 
heart of the party a stretch of pockmarked wall between the 
brandenburg gate in east berlin and a towering christmas tree on 
the west side 
tourists filled every hotel and restaurant to capacity on both 
sides of the wall and jammed streets and parking lots with 
impromptu parties 
enterprising youth like 15yearold salim mussa hawked chips of 
the wall for up to 30 west berliners rented out hammers and 
chisels and the west german government operated a mobile 
information booth for any east german visitors considering 
relocation in the west 
border police said they had no estimate of the numbers crossing 
between the two germanys

romanians today celebrated their first 
new years in more than two decades free of nicolae ceausescus 
despotism and their revolutionary leaders issued decrees that 
began to dismantle communist rule 
romanian radio reported no overnight clashes between the army 
and diehard securitate units suggesting a slow return to 
normality after two weeks of unrest believed to have claimed 
thousands of lives 
the communist party is dead deputy foreign minister 
corneliu bogdan told reporters sunday two weeks after security 
forces fired on antigovernment protesters to touch off the 
revolution that toppled ceausescu 
bogdan assured romanians that there was no danger of 
communists returning to undisputed power 
in a new years address interim president ion iliescu announced 
the abolition of the death penalty and reintroduction of the 
concept of private ownership he formally announced the abolition 
of the feared securitate the east german news agency adn reported 
from bucharest 
iliescu also signed a decree that provides the legal basis for 
the creation of new political parties an important step toward 
free elections promised for april the decree says officials of the 
defense and interior ministries judges prosecutors members of 
state radio and television cannot join political parties to ensure 
their impartiality the official agerpress news agency reported 
at least six new political parties have emerged since 
ceausescus was overthrown dec 22 by a nation outraged over the 
massacre by security forces of hundreds of people in the western 
city of timisoara 
the army had joined the people in toppling ceausescu after 24 
years of autocratic rule ceausescu and his wife elena were 
summarily tried and executed christmas day convicted of 
genocide and other grave crimes 
iliescu is a former communist party secretary who fell out of 
favor with ceausescu for speaking his mind but has the political 
experience that dissident intellectuals and other former opposition 
figures lack 
bogdan his countrys us ambassador for more than a decade 
before falling into disfavor in the early 1980s told his news 
conference that party members were in the minority in the 
provisional government but he said their expertise is needed to 
smooth the transformation to democracy 
he said those in provisional government did not consider 
themselves communist party members after the oppressive ceausescu 
era 
i was one of them he said of the communists i will pay 
for it he added without elaborating 
it was unclear how many people were in the government but 
divergent reports concurred that there were more than 20 bogdan 
gave neither overall figures nor the proportion of communists among 
the leadership 
bogdan also said soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
would be visiting later in the week 
iliescu made public agricultural production figures according to 
which the years total cereal production amounted to 169 million 
tons instead of the claimed 60 million tons other totals also 
well below claimed amounts 
he also decreed land on which farmers live and surrounding plots 
private property reestablishing a concept banned for decades 
iliescu said farmers would again be allowed to sell produce and 
animals raised on leased land 
to pay off the countrys foreign debt ceausescu had in recent 
years exported romanias best agricultural products while forcing 
privation and rationing upon his people the new government is now 
opening warehouses and making those items available to the people 
although iliescu abolished the death penalty he pledged a 
tough trial nonetheless for all those guilty of crimes an 
apparent allusion to ceausescu loyalists 
the former head of securitate iulian vlad was detained for 
questioning sunday along with three ranking members of the ministry 
controlling the police agerpress reported it did not specify what 
charges if any the four face 
thousands of securitate agents surrendered after vlad ordered 
them to last week but several hundred are believed still at large 
and prepared to die fighting 
hungarian television meanwhile reported that an assailant it 
did not identify stabbed nicu ceausescu the son of the late 
dictator immediately after he was shown on romanian television 
dec 22 
the assailant was arrested while the younger ceausescu 
underwent an operation for his stomach wound which was 
successful hungarian tv said nicu ceausescu had been a regional 
communist chief 
on new years eve adevarul the former communist daily that is 
now nonaffiliated and other newspapers reserved much of their 
space for rejoicing but the anticipation of the celebrations was 
tinged with caution 
one newspaper carried a warning from police asking holiday 
merrymakers not to use fireworks and noisemakers in the capital 
where the streets were still filled with nervous soldiers armed 
with automatic weapons 
nonetheless romanians mood seemed mostly euphoric 
romanians on the street greeted each other and foreigners with 
cheerful shouts of multi ani the equivalent of happy new year 
as they trudged through the snow and slush

the words of a south vietnamese soldier 
hold new meaning for david pye as he prepares to return to the 
country that still feeds his nightmares 
the young man who served on a night patrol with pye told him 
more than two decades ago i would like to be able to lay my head 
down at night and not hear small arms fire 
pye who runs a veterans outreach center in this seaside town 
north of boston is one of 12 veterans returning to vietnam this 
month to see if a peacetime visit will help silence the sounds of 
combat that echo in their dreams and memories 
the 16day excursion sponsored by a university of massachusetts 
center devoted to the examination of war and its aftermath is part 
of a study on posttraumatic stress disorder the flashbacks 
nightmares and depression that afflict many veterans who fought in 
vietnam a second group of veterans who also will participate in 
the study is scheduled to make a trip in may 
all the veterans participating in the trip are counselors 
there have been some ad hoc studies done but they are not 
conclusive said kevin bowen the joiner centers executive 
director and vietnam veteran there has been a lot of anecdotal 
evidence that going back to vietnam has a real healing effect on 
vets 
researchers will conduct interviews and tests on the 
participants before they go to vietnam immediately after they 
return and six months and a year after the trip 
by studying the responses over time the researchers will try to 
determine whether visiting vietnam reduced the level of post 
traumatic stress 
since learning he would be returning to vietnam pye said he has 
had several nightmares dreams he hasnt had for 18 years the 
closer we get to the date the higher my anxiety is he said 
pye 43 first came to vietnam on a troop ship on new years eve 
in 1966 he remembers watching the fireworks for a few days 
before landing i was of course scared he said 
gumersindo gomez another veteran who will be traveling with the 
group said his dreams often take him to a jungle river where he 
wades kneedeep in water while the enemy shoots from the sides 
every night ive been having nightmares gomez said these 
are combatrelated nightmares the fear of being killed 
neither gomez nor pye has returned to vietnam before and 
despite the anxiety both feel at the upcoming journey the two men 
hope the experience will help them exorcise old ghosts 
bowen remembers the anxiety of waiting to return to vietnam for 
the first time he was drafted into the army after dropping out of 
college and served from 196869 
bowen has been back four times he first went in 1987 with a 
group of college professors and since then on various projects 
sponsored by the joiner foundation 
in many ways the most profound observations were also the 
simplest the country was silent and the land was beautiful 
there was nothing in the sky bowen said 
now bowen has established a new relationship with vietnam and 
its people 
i got to places where i lost friends and that was very 
powerful he said going to the memorial in washington was one 
thing to be able to say goodbye to be able to do that there is 
just as important

a record number of manatees 160 
died in florida waters in 1989 and state biologists fear recent 
cold weather will kill more of the lumbering marine mammals 
were quite worried about the increasing number of deaths 
said bruce ackerman a researcher with the department of natural 
resources in st petersburg 
biologists estimate at least 1200 manatees an endangered 
species live in florida the population had been estimated at as 
many as 10000 a few decades ago 
in 1989 51 manatees died after hitting boats or barges and 
five were killed by other humancaused problems such as 
entanglement in fishing nets according to the department of 
natural resources 
in 1988 133 manatees were found dead in florida boats killed 
43 manatees then a record 
environmentalists and government biologists cite these 
statistics when they promote boating speed limits and increased 
protection of manatee habitat issues state lawmakers could debate 
this spring 
manatees frequent rivers estuaries canals and protected 
coastal areas that also are magnets for the states more than 
710000 registered motor boats 
the average adult manatee is about 10 feet long and weighs 1000 
pounds though some weigh three times that much gray and 
slowmoving they can be difficult for speedy boaters to spot said 
lori price captive marine mammal specialist for the department of 
natural resources 
i think very few of them boaters actually maliciously intend 
to run down a manatee she said theyre very difficult to 
see

seven months after deng xiaoping told mikhail s 
gorbachev that their decadesold ideological schism was healed 
chinese leaders are privately accusing gorbachevs reforms of 
leading the socialist world astray 
chinese authorities in internal documents and closed meetings 
reportedly blame gorbachev and his new thinking diplomacy for 
unleashing the forces that have ended 40 years of communist 
dominance in east europe 
diplomatic sources say china was being careful to avoid a public 
break with the soviet union and other fastchanging socialist 
states by stressing that china never interferes in the internal 
affairs of other nations 
the sources say open disapproval of the upheavals in east europe 
would show the chinese people how isolated their hardline leaders 
have become from the popular reforms sweeping the socialist world 
the authorities have taken a different tack drumming home in 
recent days the inevitability of communist rule in china and the 
correctness of their harsh suppression of political opposition 
privately however deng and other leaders feel betrayed by the 
revolutionary events set off by gorbachev and are deeply concerned 
that democratic unrest may spread to china the sources say 
this concern was heightened by the violent overthrow of the 
nicolae ceausescu government in romania ceausescu an old friend 
of china tried and failed to use the chinese method of silencing 
dissent with armed force 
following ceausescus downfall several illegal antigovernment 
posters have appeared on beijing campuses among the first small 
signs of resistance since the military crackdown of the studentled 
movement in june 
one internal document circulating among high officials that lays 
down official position on romania reportedly cites gorbachevs 
policies as one factor behind the turmoil in romania it also 
speaks of the subversion of hostile foreign forces a reference to 
the west 
senior party leaders have also criticized gorbachev in meetings 
convened over the past few weeks to discuss east europe sources 
say 
in may gorbachev traveled to beijing for the first 
chinesesoviet summit in 30 years he said the normalization of 
bilateral relations confirmed in his meeting with deng was of 
epochmaking significance 
it has produced more chinesesoviet trade and increased the pace 
of talks on the future of the disputed sinosoviet border premier 
li peng is still expected to return gorbachevs visit next spring 
but the democratic reforms in eastern europe have revived old 
suspicions and ruled out the possibility for ideological 
brotherhood 
a visit to china last week by valentin falin head of the soviet 
communist partys international department and the highest party 
official in china since may went unnoticed in the official chinese 
press until he met on his final day with party general secretary 
jiang zemin 
reports on that meeting had jiang lecturing falin that socialist 
reform must take the right route the soviet side had no 
comment on the talks and falin declined even to talk to the soviet 
press 
foreign ministry spokesman jin guihua asked about gorbachevs 
new thinking diplomacy that encourages socialist countries to 
choose their own paths to political reform said the concept 
requires careful and serious study 
but a soviet source said it was very clear the chinese are now 
critical of the idea sources say senior chinese leaders are 
criticizing gorbachev for confusing people about socialism 
analysts point out that the situation now is far different from 
the 1960s when mao tsetung accused moscow of revisionism and the 
two countries split over ideological differences and leadership of 
the communist world 
chinas doctrinaire hardliners still believe as jiang said in 
a recent speech that china should occupy the ideological front 
with marxism 
but with the communist world in disarray vying with the soviet 
union for ideological leadership is no longer a real prospect 
instead chinas leaders are trying to survive by staying above 
the fray the future of socialism is bright the chinese are being 
told to believe but only if china goes its own way

the green river task force which once had 56 
officers and support workers assigned to track the deaths and 
disappearances of dozens of women is being cut this week to seven 
people the seattle times reported monday 
the investigation into the deaths and disappearances of 49 women 
from 1982 through march 1984 once included several law enforcement 
jurisdictions but now will be limited to king county officers the 
case is among the largest unsolved serial murder cases in the 
united states 
we plan to keep the four detectives in the case through 1990 
it is still a major commitment but there is only a workload for so 
many sheriff james montgomery said 
the remains of 41 women have been found victims have been from 
the seattle and portland ore areas and most had ties with 
prostitution no one has been charged in the case 
the task force reached its peak in personnel in 1986 but it has 
steadily been whittled down as suspects were eliminated and the 
trail became colder 
the four remaining detectives will continue to gather 
information on 40 possible suspects who have yet to be cleared and 
process tips that continue to trickle in they will be assisted by 
two clerks and a computer analyst 
montgomery said he would quickly add personnel if there were new 
leads 
the county has spent about 16 million on the case other 
jurisdictions that have contributed personnel to the task force 
include the seattle police the fbi the washington state patrol 
and the port of seattle

a rivalry broke open monday between 
the two most powerful afghan rebel groups after one party convicted 
and hanged four members of the other for a massacre of guerrilla 
commanders 
the schism places another obstacle in the insurgents struggle 
to topple the sovietbacked kabul government and replace it with an 
islamic administration 
the guerrillas also said monday that three weeks of savage 
fighting with afghan government forces have destroyed much of the 
afghan garrision town of khost 
gulbaddin hekmatyar leader of the fundamentalist hezbiislami 
guerrilla group demanded that burhanuddin rabbani of the more 
moderate jamiatiislami stand trial for the hangings dec 21 
they took a dastardly action we didnt imagine jamiat would 
resort to such a heinous act hekmatyar told a news conference in 
islamabad 
he called for the appointment of an independent tribunal to put 
jamiat leaders on trial for the hangings which he said were the 
product of a mock trial 
hekmatyar said he was ordering his own men to stay calm 
i want to call on all hezbiislami commanders not to knuckle 
under to their emotions hekmatyar said 
however he warned jamiat guerrillas not to cross hezb territory 
in afghanistan until the dispute is settled 
a jamiat spokesman said its northern commander ahmad shah 
masoud ordered the execution of syed jamal and three other men of 
the hezb party in taloqan capital of northern takhar province 
according to the report jamal confessed his crimes against 
the mujahedeen and the people said the spokesman who identified 
himself only as omar the guerrillas are known as mujahedeen or 
islamic holy warriors 
hekmatyar has acknowledged that jamal and some other hezb men 
captured about 30 jamiat commanders and murdered some of july 9 in 
the same province he says nine were killed but jamiat claims it 
was all 30 
masoud later captured jamal and dozens of other hezb members 
unconfirmed reports indicate that hundreds may have died in 
subsequent clashes between the two groups in various parts of 
northern afghanistan 
both parties are based in pakistan which funnels ussupplied 
arms to them and five other guerrilla factions 
they have been fighting for 11 years to topple kabuls ruling 
marxists who themselves are split into two rival factions soviet 
troops intervened between december 1979 and february 1989 but 
moscow continues to arm afghanistans military 
despite predictions of their early defeat after the soviet 
pullout the afghan communists still hold the countrys major 
cities the guerrillas control about 90 percent of the countryside 
the clashes in northeastern afghanistan are mainly a turf war in 
the homeland of the tajik tribe which dominates jamiat 
the ethnic pathans of hezbiislami are a minority in the 
northeast but form an overall majority among the countrys 15 
million people 
more than 5 million have fled the war to refugee camps in 
pakistan and iran 
thirty guerrillas were killed and 80 injured in the fighting 
near khost 15 miles west of the pakistan border said fazal akbar 
head of proguerrilla afghan information and documentation center 
akbar quoted a guerrilla commander as saying 150 government 
soliders were killed or wounded 
most parts of the city of khost have been destroyed said 
akbar quoting mali khan commander of harkateinqilabeislami 
rebel group 
mali khan also claimed that the guerrillas shot down an afghan 
military aircraft dec 25 but he gave no further details of the 
plane or its occupants 
there was no comment by the afghan government to the report 
which could not be independently verified

an electronic peephole that displays the 
telephone number of incoming calls is worrying defenders of privacy 
rights and stirring concern on capitol hill 
but others say the new gadget will shortcircuit nuisance calls 
and will be a boon to law enforcement 
the new service is known as automatic number identification or 
caller id and is being offered for about 650 a month plus 
another 60 to 80 for a small viewing device that flashes an 
incoming number before the phone is answered 
businesses love it but privacy advocates say its big brother 
and will lead to phone prefix discrimination and other social 
ills as people selectively decide what calls to answer or to ignore 
this changes the nature of phone service it suddenly is 
interactive says gary marx a professor of sociology at the 
massachusetts institute of technology 
the phone companies are trying to create the argument that 
your phone number is something you have no rights over marx 
says this service essentially says you dont control your 
phone number we do 
opponents of caller id also say it is a device of telephone 
merchandizing companies to mine for gold the names telephone 
numbers and buying habits of people who make phone orders or 
inquiries 
mark plotkin a washington political fundraiser and liberal 
commentator says using phones to gather information on people has 
frightening orwellian implications for the future 
first its the phone number and then its all sorts of 
information on the screen what color he is what political 
party he belongs to his religious background plotkin says 
caller id is drawing the attention of congress it will be one 
of several privacy issues to be discussed in house and senate 
judiciary subcommittee hearings this spring congressional sources 
say 
we will urge congress to adopt legislation to require blocking 
devices says janlori goldman a staff attorney with the american 
civil liberties union 
heated debate has surrounded proposals to introduce caller id in 
several jurisdictions nationwide california already has passed a 
law banning the service unless customers are given the ability to 
block it on their phones 
caller id will begin jan 9 in pennsylvania despite strenuous 
opposition but state phone regulators said bell of pennsylvania 
must allow police and domestic violence intervention agencies to 
block the service at will 
new york state regulators refused to allow rochester telephone 
co to offer the service unless customers had a total blocking 
option 
caller id has been available on a limited basis in new jersey 
since october 1988 it was introduced in maryland and virginia in 
the past two months and phone users in charleston wva are 
ordering it now according to bell atlantic spokesman ken pitt 
south central bell a division of bellsouth began offering the 
service in the memphis area in december and expects to begin 
offering it in north carolina south carolina and florida within 
the next six months said jim whitehead an official with bellsouth 
services 
nynex will offer it in bennington vt before next summer 
nynex official joe gagen said 
american telephone amp telegraph co also offers the service to 
its 800number customers to enable businesses to quickly call up 
computerized records when customers call 
new jersey bell spokesman james w carrigan said that following 
the introduction of caller id requests from customers for traps or 
call trace records declined 49 percent in hudson county during a 
sixmonth period 
statewide the number of requests decreased 18 percent and we 
expect that to increase with the availability of caller id 
carrigan said 
caller id also is being used by police to trace bomb threats and 
false alarms 
and it is valued by takeout operations such as pizza parlors to 
verify phone orders 
retail businesses and banks say caller id allows them to have 
customers records available before a company representative picks 
up the call even though it makes some customers uneasy to be 
greeted by name before they identify themselves 
for the average phone user phone company officials say caller 
id simply lets them see whos trying to enter their residences by 
telephone 
you have the right to know when you answer the door to know 
whos there pitt says

the new cordiality in romaniansoviet 
relations following the overthrow of nicolae ceausescu may turn 
sour over the issue of moldavian territory annexed by the soviets 
in 1940 
moscow accepted a romanian invitation for soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze to visit in january the official 
soviet news agency tass said sunday but it remains to be seen 
whether moldavia will be on the agenda 
on the surface moscow is only delighted with the revolution 
that ousted and executed ceausescu who was publicly if politely 
chided for his corrupt nepotism by soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev on a visit two years ago 
romanias new president ion iliescu is an acquaintance of 
gorbachev from days when both worked in communist youth movements 
east bloc diplomats say 
the soviet president underlined the chumminess in a 
congratulatory telephone call to iliescu last week an item given 
prominent publicity in the romanian newspapers 
iliescu 59 a once prominent communist who fell afoul of 
ceausescu in 1971 and spent the next 18 years in the political 
wilderness is well liked by soviets in bucharest who say he has a 
russian wife 
he speaks good russian english and french and is overall a 
cultured man a soviet diplomat smiled approvingly 
but both the soviets and iliescu who spent time as party leader 
in the northern city of iasi near the border with soviet moldavia 
must know that the new friendliness could turn sour if people on 
both sides of the border start wanting to unite 
its a key issue and one that everybody will be watching 
closely said a western diplomat who asked not to be identifed 
the soviets must be concerned 
east bloc diplomats asking not to be identifed act as if there 
is no potential problem 
under the old regime every day there was an article pushing 
their nationalism said one that will change now 
another expressed confidence that the borders drawn in 1940 when 
the soviets used a secret protocol to the hitlerstalin pact to 
annex part of moldavia would stay as they are 
its history he said yes weve now admitted that 
romanian and moldavian are in effect the same language but i dont 
think the borders will shift 
ceausescu himself drew attention to the moldavian issue when he 
said at the congress that unanimously reelected him president only 
a month ago that the hitlerstalin pact should be annulled and 
all the consequences of it eliminated possibly suggesting 
moscow should relinquish control of moldavia moldavis is known 
under romanian rule as bessarabia 
that remark was typical both of the nationalism fed by 
ceausescus dreams of a great romania with himself its undisputed 
heroic leader and of the distance he always kept from moscow 
ceausescu refused to take part in the 1968 warsaw pact invasion 
of czechoslovakia ignored kremlin bans on trading with the west 
and refused to station warsaw pact troops on his territory 
once gorbachevs reforms took hold of the soviet union 
ceausescu reduced relations to a bare minimum of trade 
intellectuals invited to moscow would find it close to 
impossible to get permission to go romanian officials questioned 
on soviet reforms sneered and implied that the soviets were no 
liberals if they had annexed moldavia 
it seems the kremlins only requirement as its former satellites 
break away is a promise to remain in the warsaw pact alliance 
on friday corneliu bogdan a fluent russian english and french 
speaker who is deputy foreign minister duly gave that assurance 
following the pattern set by solidarity and civic forum the 
opposition movements that now share power with communists in poland 
and czechoslovakia 
but many romanians perceive communism as a system imported from 
the russians who also stole moldavia and their resentment 
could boil over into antisoviet policies and demands for their old 
territory 
with just a week passed since ceausescu was ousted no diplomats 
or romanians can forecast the outcome of the promised free 
elections 
already however conservative parties banned after the 
communist takeover in 1947 are reemerging these groups have a 
strong strain of nationalism 
romanias new leaders might therefore be less amenable to the 
soviets who face their own problems with the strength of the 
popular front movement in moldavia pushing for more independence 
from moscow and the decision by the national congess last week to 
declare the secret protocol of the hitlerstalin pact null and void

power in the zulu townships of natal province since 1986 and more 
than 2500 people have been killed december was the most violent

president corazon aquino called 
monday for a decade of peace in this troubled land and 
announced plans for a national peace conference to bring stability 
and social justice to the philippines 
the call came during a new years day ceremony at the 
presidential palace in which roman catholic leaders also urged 
stability in a country fighting communist and moslem insurgencies 
and hit by six coup attempts in less than three years 
mrs aquino said peace cannot come from the marxist left that 
would impose their evil and godless ways on us nor can it come 
from the fascist right whose lust for wealth and power would bring 
us back to the dark days of the tyrant 
i shall invite the leaders of the private and church sectors 
to join the government in convening a national peace conference so 
that we can work out resolve and act to attack the deep sources of 
our divisions our conflicts our injustices and inequities in 
society which are obstacles to peace she said 
communist rebels have waged a 21year insurgency and dissidents 
in the military have launched the coup attempts the most recent on 
dec 1 
at least 113 people were killed and more than 500 injured during 
the dec 19 coup attempt key mutiny leaders including former lt 
col gregorio gringo honasan remain at large and have 
threatened to continue efforts to oust mrs aquino 
mrs aquino gave no date for the conference nor did she say 
what groups she will invite mrs aquino has refused to resume 
peace talks with the communists until they lay down their arms she 
has also ruled out talks with dissident soldiers involved in 
previous coup attempts 
in her speech she also made no mention of aspirations for 
selfrule by the countrys 4 millionstrong moslem minority which 
has also been waging a 20year revolt for independence in the south 
the communists moslem rebels and honasans followers say mrs 
aquinos hardline conditions have made it impossible for them to 
join in any dialogue with the government 
on sunday mrs aquino made the most extensive cabinet change of 
her presidency appointing new leaders for finance justice and 
military affairs 
her spokesman adolfo azcuna said the changes were made in 
hopes of improving government performance which has been widely 
criticized as ineffectual 
elsewhere filipinos greeted the new year with a barrage of 
fireworks and shooting of guns that killed eight people and injured 
more than 1700 officials said monday fireworks accidents 
triggered five fires in the capital and burned down a garment 
factory in a nearby province officials said

black leaders undeterred by a wave of fatal 
bombings and threats turned out today to renew their commitment to 
the civilrights movement starting with a new years day 
commemoration of the emancipation proclamation 
i do not sense any feeling of fear the reaction on this has 
to be positive appropriate it has to be without fear said 
maynard jackson who is to be sworn in as atlantas mayor on 
tuesday i do sense a determination to work harder for human 
rights for all people 
an naacp official had said a strong turnout at todays 
emancipation day program would show civilrights activists 
arent intimidated by the mail bombs that killed a federal judge 
and a lawyer 
a city police bomb squad with a sniffing dog searched the 
hoosier united methodist church about an hour before the program 
began half an hour later about 75 people were in the church and 
more were streaming in 
four police cars were parked in front of and alongside the 
church but access to the building was free naacp officials had 
said earlier that the fbi also would be on hand 
one of the big objectives of terrorist activity is to induce 
fear and disrupt regular activities said earl shinhoster 
regional director of the national association for the advancement 
of colored people i hope this would be a time to band together 
against fear and show the resolve to continue our work 
but shinhoster whom the fbi has given close protection since 
the bombings said there would be tight security at the 
naacpsponsored events marking president lincolns signing of the 
proclamation that freed slaves in the south the fbi and local law 
officers planned to be at the atlanta program at hoosier memorial 
united methodist church one of the higher profile events 
no doubt we have thought to take extra security precautions 
here and elsewhere in the south as well said shinhoster who was 
scheduled to speak at a tuscaloosa ala program today 
the mailbomb deaths of us circuit judge robert vance on dec 
16 and savannah ga lawyer and civilrights leader robert 
robinson two days later are believed to be linked 
two other bombs one delivered to a federal courthouse in 
atlanta and one to an naacp office in jacksonville fla were 
intercepted before they could explode robinson worked with the 
naacp 
a letter to an atlanta television station from a group claiming 
responsibility for the previous bombings said last week that two 
more members of the naacp would be killed 
the writer expressed anger at crimes by blacks against whites 
and at federal court decisions on school integration the letter 
also threatened that any time a black man rapes a white woman in 
alabama florida or georgia a federal judge an attorney and an 
naacp official would be assassinated 
the fbi which has been working on the case since vance was 
killed refused to comment on the investigation 
jackson said sunday that letters threatening more assassinations 
had led to a backlash not a backlash of fear but of 
determination 
despite the security concerns shinhoster said the bombings have 
led to a coming together among those of us in the human 
rights community 
both whites and blacks he said can see that the bombings are 
as much an attack on america and her institutions as on 
individuals 
he said the terrorism creates a new opportunity to forge new 
relationships between blacks and whites 
the celebrations of the emancipation proclamation which 
president abraham lincoln issued to free slaves in the confederacy 
during the civil war have been sponsored by the naacp for 70 
years shinhoster said informal celebrations date from the time 
the proclamation went into effect jan 1 1863

they toppled manuel antonio noriega be brought to justice in the 
united states 
mrs bush said she and her husband spent a quiet new years eve 
at their houston hotel suite retiring by 9 pm without even 
popping the cork on a bottle of champagne

the panama invasion wasnt an hour old before 
the telephone awakened army col mel hoherz it wasnt a day old 
before hoherz had dispatched officers on those dreadful 
knockonthedoor missions to inform families that a son or husband 
had died in combat 
as with everything the army has a system for this and a 
214page regulation 60081 on what to do when a soldier is killed 
an army manual even tells the visiting officer what to say 
the secretary of the army has asked me to express his deep 
regret 
hoherz son of a career army officer grandson of a german 
pacifist who fled to america to avoid military service is in 
charge of seeing to it the process runs smoothly 
we try to do it with dignity he said in a recent interview 
everyone grieves differently and sometimes they grieve angrily 
in anger at the army and we know that but we try to be helpful 
hoherzs job is to see to it that the body is accompanied to the 
gravesite by a soldier sometimes by a buddy who has been 
designated for the task by the surviving family 
hoherz dispatches the notifier who brings the first word 
but often no details and offers whatever comfort a stranger can 
by regulation the message is always delivered in person 
he makes sure that another officer follows up with the forms 
that will bring the family the benefits to which it is entitled 
usually a 50000 life insurance payment plus a 3000 death 
gratuity payment the soldiers unpaid pay and allowances a 
monthly check for the widow until she remarries and surviving 
children until they are age 18 23 if they go to college and 
social security benefits 
he tries to nudge families toward opting for a military funeral 
we can do it with great dignity and they dont need an unexpected 
5000 expense at a time like this hoherz says the army will 
provide a steel casket worth 2000 six pallbearers and a 
sevenmember firing team that fires three volleys of shots 
and hoherz makes sure word reaches the white house where 
president bush has determined to write a personal letter to the 
family of every military man killed in the line of duty 
panama marked the first american battle deaths since the grenada 
episode in 1983 which killed 19 us servicemen 
in panama the us military suffered 23 deaths 18 army four 
navy one marine and 322 wounded among panamanians 297 soldiers 
and some 300 civilians were killed 
panama aside the army had 116 military related deaths in 1989 
helicopter crashes training accidents heart attacks and the like 
and about 625 other accidental deaths mostly car crashes 
hoherzs outfit the casualties and memorial affairs operations 
center in suburban alexandria va seeks to notify the family 
within four hours of receiving word of the casualty 
the old process is still used an officer or senior 
noncommissioned officer is sent from a nearby military base 
sometimes he brings along a chaplain no mission is undertaken 
between 10 pm and 6 am 
in these days of family mobility and frequent divorce hoherz 
says notifiers often must do detective work to track down 
relatives or estranged wives sometimes using the police or postman 
or utility company records 
how to do it is spelled out in a 53page manual that uses the 
initials nok for next of kin 
as a notifier you represent the secretary of the army the 
manual says you are expected to be courteous helpful and 
sympathetic toward the nok in this sensitive mission your presence 
should soften the blow if possible and show the armys concern 
for its personnel their dependents and their nok 
the visit is followed by a telegram or a mailgram its purpose 
is to confirm what has been said and to make it clear the family 
has not been the victim of a macabre hoax 
meantime at the scene of combat there is a written report on 
the fatal event and an investigation if it is an unexplained 
death hoherz says families are entitled to these reports and to 
autopsy reports but they must ask for them 
a company commander in theory at least knows the people in his 
unit if hes doing his job hell know them by name and well 
enough to know where they come from and whether theyre married 
that sort of thing says hoherz 
the company commander writes a letter of condolence to the next 
of kin it is sent within 24 hours if field conditions permit this 
letter often brings the first full account of how the soldier died

north korean president kim il sung said monday a 
border wall in south korea should be torn down and free northsouth 
travel ensured as a step toward reunification 
in a new years speech distributed by north koreas official 
korean central news agency monitored in tokyo the hardline 
communist leader also denounced what he called a grave 
imperialist challenge to socialism 
there can be no change in the truth of history that mankind 
must follow the road of socialism kim said without directly 
mentioning the collapse of communist governments in eastern europe 
he did refer indirectly to the opening of the wall between 
communist east germany and the capitalist west 
in urging the removal of a concrete wall south of the border 
kim declared now that both the united states and south korean 
authorities welcome the opening of the barrier of division in 
another country there is no reason why the concrete wall in korea 
should not be destroyed 
north korea and south korea divided since 1945 technically are 
still in a state of war an armistice rather than a peace treaty 
ended the 195053 korean war the demilitarized zone between the 
two is heavily guarded and koreans need permission from both 
governments to cross the border 
in south korea a dissident christian pastor has been sentenced 
to 10 years in prison and a radical student is on trial for 
unauthorized visits to north korea that they said were aimed at 
promoting unification 
kim said the two came to pyongyang at the risk of their 
lives as messengers bearing the south korean peoples unanimous 
desire for reunification 
commenting on seouls insistence that contacts with north korea 
go through official channels kim said reunification is an 
important question that cannot be placed at the mercy of a few 
authorities or of a specified stratum 
seoul says north korea has been encouraging south korean 
dissidents to visit pyongyang to try to encourage discord 
kim said that when free travel is ensured it will be possible 
to achieve the consensus of the will and united efforts of the 
korean nation for reunfication 
negotiations on travel politics the economy and culture must 
be held without delay he said reiterating a call for a 
conference that would include leaders of south korean opposition 
parties 
in our area north of the military demarcation line there is 
no barrier except barbed wires which mark a boundary we can remove 
them anytime kim said 
talks so far on easing tensions and working toward reunification 
have made little progress with each side insisting on its own 
proposals 
in seoul south korean defense minister lee sanghoon said he 
expects arms control talks between the two nations will be possible 
in the mid1990s the korea herald said monday 
our efforts to achieve peaceful unification of the divided 
korean peninsula need to initiate arms control talks between the 
two halves lee said in an interview with the englishlanguage 
daily 
lee also said north korea beset by economic difficulties 
resulting from its continuing arms buildup could not continue to 
ignore the democratric reforms sweeping eastern europe and may be 
forced to come out of isolation 
in his remarks on the international scene kim said the 
imperialists are making frantic efforts to undermine socialism 
recently the us imperialists declared before the world the 
end of the cold war and the advent of an era of peace but this was 
immediately followed by their open invasion against panama a 
sovereign state this shows clearly that peace and detente 
claimed by the imperialists is a big deception and that they are 
outrageous aggressors 
kim said the road to socialism is an untrodden path 
therefore in the course of advance one may encounter unexpected 
incidents and undergo trials and tribulations the way of building 
socialism should also be steadily improved and perfected in keeping 
with the change in the situation but there can be no change in the 
truth of history that mankind must follow the road of socialism 
japanese radio monitors said that in kims new year messages to 
other leaders north korea gave first place to china instead of the 
soviet union like kim chinese leaders have vowed not to deviate 
from socialism 
north korean media did not mention messages to east germany 
romania hungary and yugoslavia although messages to those east 
european countries have been prominently mentioned in past years

one of the latest superfund successes 
felt like a long wait to ralph bidgood whose fouryear ordeal 
began the night he discovered some people probing the dirt behind 
his mobile home 
there were people in white suits and rubber gloves and rubber 
boots walking around and i started wondering what was going on 
bidgood said 
he found that his home sat atop a toxic waste dump that had been 
oozing arsenic benzene cyanide and lead into drinking wells and 
the nearby black river and seavers brook for up to 40 years 
an epa official termed the site a chemical time bomb and 
said it was the only superfund site in new england that had people 
living on top of it 
bidgoods ordeal is over on friday his trailer like 33 
others in the park was purchased by the polluters and bidgood 
moved to an apartment three remaining trailers will soon be 
purchased 
this is the first and probably the only site in new england 
that involves permanent relocation of residents said paul 
keough acting regional administrator for the us environmental 
protection agency he termed the site a time bomb in 1988 well 
after it was added to the superfund list in 1982 
in an agreement announced last month four parties 
springfield emhart industries inc textron inc and 
browningferris industries have admitted liability for the 
pollution and agreed to pay the epa 175 million the site was 
once a town landfill 
they also will provide millions to build a pipeline system to 
collect the seepage and a treatment plant to remove the chemicals 
town manager william steele said the treatment and monitoring will 
continue for 30 years 
the companies also set up a trust fund to buy the mobile homes 
the total cleanup cost could reach 15 million keough said he 
said he could not estimate how much of that would be federal money 
nor could he say how much in federal funds has been spent so far 
the epa also has identified nine other parties that may be held 
liable for the pollution that investigation is continuing 
although the epa has been criticized by state and local 
officials for the long process most officials agree that a 
settlement probably would not have been reached without its 
involvement 
the potentially responsible parties would like to pretend that 
those dumps dont exist at all said former us sen robert 
stafford of vermont who drafted the superfund legislation while 
chairman of the committee on environment and public works they 
wont do anything until the epa gets after them 
the federal superfund program cleans toxic waste dumps around 
the country a 1985 reauthorization of the program set aside 85 
billion for the cleanups the epas national priorities list 
currently names about 1250 hazardous waste sites 
the epa tries to get polluters to pay for the cleanups 
nationally it has collected more than 1 billion in cleanup 
expenses 
springfield a town of about 10000 in southeastern vermont was 
dominated by its machine tools industry for about 150 years 
from 1946 to 1968 those factories dumped their industrial waste 
in the town landfill which was built on eight acres on a hill 
overlooking the town 
everything was done according to the environmental regulations 
at the time steele said the whole thing was done with the 
idea well lets do something environmentally sound rather than 
dump it in the river lets put it in this landfill 
after the dump reached capacity and closed it ultimately was 
used as a mobile home park beginning in 1971 about the same time 
that surrounding residents began complaining of odor and 
discoloration of their well water 
they studied the problem for eight years steele said 
there was a perception that the epa was taking too long 
keough said the lengthy process is necessary and added that the 
epas cautious and expensive pace may even encourage polluters to 
admit liability 
i think theres a feeling in the private sector that they can 
do it quicker and cheaper than the federal government keough 
said its to their advantage to get on board early 
bidgood 43 moved to the site several years after it was put on 
the superfund list but said he didnt know that until several years 
later when he saw the environmental inspectors digging in his yard 
bidgood settled with the polluters for 31000 while packing 
his belongings thursday he vowed not to release the polluters from 
any future liability if he gets ill 
im not really scared about it but im not signing off on 
it he said i just want to get out of here

the bells of st basils cathedral rang out over 
red square monday for the first time since 1922 when the atheist 
soviets clamped down on the operations of the russian orthodox 
church 
more than 100000 muscovites poured into the vast square more 
often used military parades and streamed past the kremlin and the 
mausoleum of soviet founder vladimir lenin to gather around the 
colored cupolas of st basils for several bell concerts on new 
years day 
its a surprise for the heart said a middleaged woman with 
a wistful smile 
its like visiting the past said victor kisin a member of 
the soviet parliament who leaned against a lamp post listening to 
the discordant song 
the crowd covered all ages from toddlers bundled against the 
cold to elderly women wrapped in traditional flowered russian 
headscarves listening raptly to the bells as they throbbed and 
occasionally clanked when the scheduled 15minute concert was 
completed the crowd clapped until bell master ivan danilov 
continued with two encores 
under president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms authorities have 
dramatically reduced harassment of religious believers thousands 
of churches mosques and other religious buildings which had been 
converted into museums cabbage warehouses offices and even a 
swimming pool are being returned to their original uses 
st basils is still a museum of architecture completed in 
1560 its brilliantly colored fanciful onion domes are a 
worldfamous symbol for the soviet union 
its religious use was reduced in 1922 when it was downgraded 
from a cathedral to a church and religious operations ceased 
entirely in 1929 museum officials said 
while many soviets are rediscovering religion the audience for 
mondays bell concert reflected the fact that after decades of 
suppression most soviets view religion more with curiosity than 
with fervor 
such traditions are wonderful said one woman lamenting the 
decades during which the bells were silent once she said moscow 
had 40 cathedrals and their bells gave the city its character 
we lost our roots added victor moiseyenko who brought his 
toddler irina to the cathedral so she might find them 
whipping in the wind in the background were bright blue and 
white banners containing snowflakes and holiday greetings new 
years decorations this year were remarkably free of the usual 
political slogans

cuba is beginning the new year on an upbeat 
note after a string of setbacks as it assumes a un security 
council seat for the first time since the 1959 revolution 
some us officials are concerned that cubas election to a 
council seat will give president fidel castro new leverage for 
influencing council debates and promoting antiamerican policies 
but more optimistic officials believe cuba may feel constrained 
in its new role to diminish its alleged support for leftist rebels 
in el salvador 
cuba will assume its seat as the united nations gears up to send 
a peacekeeping force to central america to ensure that rebel forces 
such as the salvadoran insurgency do not receive outside assistance 
in response to american criticism cuba contends that no country 
tramples on un principles more relentlessly than the united 
states 
as cuba sees it the invasion of panama is just the latest 
example of the us interventionism after the invasion there were 
large demonstrations in front of the american diplomatic mission in 
havana 
cubas accession to a security council seat is a bright spot in 
an otherwisebleak period for the island nation cuba had close 
ties with all of the governments in eastern europe that have been 
forced out in recent months ideologically cuba has never been 
more isolated 
the ouster of panamas gen manuel antonio noriega was also seen 
as a loss for cuba because the leaders of both countries had a 
shared hostility for the united states 
us officials are particularly disappointed over cubas 
elevation to a council seat because other latin american countries 
rallied behind cubas candidacy last year over us objections 
un tradition holds that the election of a given country is 
automatic if it receives the endorsement by consensus of other 
countries from the same region 
the united states tried to encourage other hemispheric countries 
to oppose cubas candidacy several tested the waters but dropped 
out leaving cuba uncontested 
on the other hand the administration did block a movement in 
the organization of american states in the fall to allow the cuban 
government to reclaim its oas seat cuba was expelled from the oas 
in the early 1960s 
a state department official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the latin americans yielded to castros un candidacy because 
they were unwilling to take on the guy who can make trouble for 
them and intimidate them 
gillian gunn an associate at the carnegie endowment for 
international peace offered a more charitable explanation 
ms gunn who visited cuba in november said cubas image in the 
hemisphere was enhanced during the crucial period in the first half 
of 1989 when the issue of who would win the council seat was being 
decided 
cubas improved standing was the result of its decision in

attendance at three latin american presidential inaugurations in 
late 1988 and early 1989 she said 
castros presence implied respect for democratic processes in 
the hemisphere american officials were disappointed that latin 
american and caribbean democracies now the overwhelming majority 
would rally behind an unelected president for one of the 10 
nonpermanent security council seats 
but there was some sentiment in the hemisphere that cuba 
deserved the seat after having been systematically excluded for 
more than 30 years 
in addition a latin american president told a us diplomat 
privately that castro is likely to behave more moderately if he is 
treated as a member of the club rather than as an outcast 
but said otto reich a former us ambassador to venezuela the 
latin americans are wrong to think that castro is no longer a 
threat 
they are engaging in a bit of selfdeception by thinking that 
he has reich said

sri lanka will negotiate with india 
this week to speed up the withdrawal of indian peacekeeping troops 
a foreign ministry official said monday 
the pullout had been scheduled for sunday but was delayed until 
march 31 after vp singh replaced rajiv gandhi as indias prime 
minister in december 
foreign secretary bernard tillekeratne will fly to new delhi on 
tuesday to start the discussions the foreign ministry official 
said 
depending on how the talks go foreign minister ranjan wijeratne 
may join tillekeratne in the indian capital on thursday the 
official added speaking on condition of anonymity 
in new delhi however a spokesman for the indian foreign 
ministry said no dates for the talks had been fixed the indian 
spokesman also speaking on condition of anonymity said he 
expected wijeratne to arrive about friday 
the sri lankan official said there have been positive 
responses from new delhi that india might speed up its march 31 
deadline for pulling out the last members of the peacekeeping 
force the official said 
but the indian foreign ministry spokesman said i dont know 
really what theyre basing that on 
the indian government invited both wijeratne and tillekeratne 
who is the secondhighest official in sri lankas foreign ministry 
to new delhi for talks this week indian officials in colombo and 
new delhi said 
in september india and sri lanka agreed the indian troops would 
leave by 1990 but india said the pullout would take longer after 
singh took office indian foreign minister inder kumar gujral said 
the withdrawal should be completed by march 31 
sri lanka says it wants the deadline moved up so it can be host 
of a sevennation summit of south asian leaders in early april 
colombo was scheduled to be the venue for the 1989 summit of the 
south asia association for regional cooperation but president 
ranasinghe premadasa refused to be host while foreign troops 
remained in his country 
indian soldiers were sent to sri lanka in july 1987 under an 
accord signed by gandhi and premadasas predecessor junius r 
jayewardene the peace pact was designed to end a revolt by tamil 
guerrillas who sought to create a separate homeland for their 
ethnic minority in northeastern sri lanka 
india initially deployed only 2000 men to supervise a surrender 
of arms by tamil fighters but the largest tamil militia reneged on 
the pact and started fighting the indians 
new delhis involvement in the internal affairs of its small 
neighbor escalated with the peacekeeping force numbering about 
100000 men at its peak 
in 1989 indian troops withdrew in phases from six of the eight 
districts where they had been based an estimated 25000 remain 
india got involved in sri lanka because of pressure from its 
politically powerful tamil minority who sympathized with fellow 
tamils in sri lanka 
tamils comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people the 
islands government and military are controlled by the sinhalese 
who account for 75 percent of the population 
at least 17000 people have been killed since the tamil 
insurrection began in 1983 about 11000 people including 1100 
indian soldiers were killed in the northeast where most tamils 
live

veronica prego had everything to look forward to 
at the age of 25 as she embarked on a medical career until she 
says she pricked her finger with an aidscontaminated needle and 
the future came crashing down 
seven years later pregos 175 million negligence lawsuit is 
going to trial tuesday while she fights to survive the ravages of 
aids 
pregos lawyer diane wilner says prego sued kings county 
hospital its parent agency the city and two doctors to ensure 
that other doctors are protected its her no 1 priority at 
least on the days that shes not being rushed to an emergency room 
with aidsrelated maladies 
she will die from it thats a fact said wilner the 
only question is when 
but there are many other questions about how prego contracted 
the disease about how much a hospital should do to protect workers 
from aids 
the case is terribly important because it could set a 
precedent that hospitals are liable when an employee is infected 
said larry gostin associate professor of health law at the harvard 
school of public health and executive director of the american 
society of law and medicine 
even before the trial there has been sensationalism 
there have been charges that the defendants lawyers stalled so 
prego would die before the case went to trial the state attorney 
generals office subpoenaed her sympathy cards to ferret out 
sympathetic jurors 
in legal briefs lawyers for the health and hospitals corp 
which operates city hospitals have complained about newspapers 
sleazy reporting on the case charging that they printed 
propaganda without regard to the truth 
it comes down to what a jury will believe happened in january 
1983 
prego was a medical school graduate working under a licensed 
physician in preparation for a hospital internship she says she 
was cleaning up after an intern dr joyce fogel when she reached 
into a tangle of gauze and bed linens in which fogel had 
negligently and improperly left a bloody needle 
the hospitals side dr fogel has stated adamantly that she 
wasnt present when the blood was drawn and did not cause the 
injury she wasnt there said fred winters spokesman for 
health and hospitals 
there are two different versions of how dr prego received her 
injury said winters the defense has refused to elaborate 
wilner said prego reported her injury because the needle had 
been used to draw blood from a known aids patient 
the powers that be assured her there were no reports of a 
health care worker getting aids through occupational exposure at 
that time that may very well have been a true statement wilner 
said 
prego argues that the hospital failed to provide 
punctureresistant containers for contaminated needles winters 
said hhc hospitals were in the forefront of following the known 
precautions against aids transmission at the time 
in 1985 prego tested positive for exposure to the aids virus 
when she agreed to take part in a study on the incidence of the 
virus among healthcare workers 
prego says the researcher dr sheldon landesman of the state 
university of new york told hospital personnel she was infected 
even though she had been promised the results were confidential he 
has denied any breach of confidentiality but she has sued him as 
well 
in november 1987 prego was diagnosed as having aids she 
completed a fellowship from home and now works on research when her 
health permits 
despite her illness she intends to testify at trial she is not 
available for interviews 
the centers for disease control has documented 19 cases and are 
investigating several others of health workers who contracted the 
virus at work twelve of them were stuck by needles said cdc 
spokesman chuck fallis 
kings county hospital and the hhc say they acted prudently to 
protect employees from aids they argue that pregos should be a 
workers compensation case 
prego has said she fears the city wants me to die before 
trial can start 
hospital officials vehemently deny that 
we have taken every step we can to expedite dr pregos case 
so that she will have an opportunity to pursue her claim said 
winters he said the hospital had waived a procedure that would 
have delayed the trial another year

labor and industry officials today announced 
tentative settlement of the bitter ninemonth pittston coal strike 
that has idled 1700 miners in virginia west virginia and kentucky 
we came to what i really believe is a reasonable solution 
to both sides it is fair and it is honorable special mediator 
wj usery said at a news conference in the office of labor 
secretary elizabeth dole 
agreement was reached in the first hours of 1990 following six 
days of marathon negotiations 
united mine workers president richard trumka said it is too 
early to say when the miners will return to work and that they 
would first have to ratify the agreement 
terms of the settlement were not disclosed with both sides 
saying they wanted the miners to hear details from their leaders 
trumka said the specifics should be in the hands of the rank and 
file within eight to 10 days 
both sides they were happy with the agreement 
we just couldnt be happier to stand before you today we 
think weve met the essential objectives of all those concerned 
said pittston co chairman paul w douglas 
mrs dole said one of the most difficult issues was the 
longterm security of the pension and health care benefits for 
the miners and their families 
pittston had balked at continuing payments into a pension fund 
a move that had preciptated the walkout 
mrs dole said she will appoint a commission to review all 
aspects of the pension and healthcare issue and make 
recommendations to me for dealing with it 
she said the commission would report to her within six months 
trumka stressed the commission was not part of the settlement 
and said the provisions for resolving the dispute over pittston 
payments did not involve any type of interim arrangment 
the funds issue has been settle between pittston and the 
united mine workers the union president said 
the strike which was punctuated by large labor rallies 
vandalism and rockthrowing confrontations between strikers and 
other company workers began april 5 
organized labor rallied around the strike with some 46000 coal 
workers in 10 states walking off their jobs in sympathy strikes at 
one point 
in charleston west virginia gov gaston caperton said i 
think that its the greatest way we could start the new year this 
has been a very long strike and a very difficult strike for the 
miners and their families 
both sides had been under a gag order during the talks at a 
downtown washington hotel 
usery a former labor secretary had said he hoped to reach a 
tentative settlement by new years day 
the union workers struck in april after pittston decided to end 
contributions to the umw retirement and health plans for some 
130000 workers the union said the decision could cause other coal 
companies to follow suit and retired miners would lose their 
benefits 
pittston the nations largest coal exporter says it cannot 
afford the payments because it faces high costs to ship its coal 
overseas 
the umw also said job security was threatened because pittston 
had refused to go along with an industry agreement to give laidoff 
workers the first chance at new job openings 
the umw raised a strike fund of more than 100 million giving 
striking workers about 200 a week to live on plus a christmas 
bonus miners normally earn up to 635 a week the union also is 
facing fines of 635 million for violating court orders limiting 
picketing and other strike activities 
pittston hired replacement workers but production has been well 
below prestrike levels the company reported its coal operations 
lost 36 million in the second quarter of 1989 and 98 million in 
the third quarter compared with profits of 9 million and 74 
million in the respective quarters of 1988

week after week despairing czechoslovaks saw 
the tormented face of oncejaunty alexander dubcek on television 
imploring calm and discipline while he waged a losing struggle to 
salvage some freedoms of the 1968 prague spring 
that was in occupied czechoslovakia after soviet and warsaw pact 
troops invaded nearly 22 years ago dubcek faded from view in late 
1969 and was seldom mentioned publicly during a politically grim 
prague winter that lasted a generation 
czechoslovakias political winter is ending now with a dramatic 
sovietblessed peaceful rollback of hardline communist rule last 
thursday dubcek was elected chairman of the federal assembly 
restoring him to honor and position after two decades in political 
oblivion 
also dissident playwright vaclav havel was elected president of 
the republic czechoslovakias first noncommunist state chief 
since eduard benes resigned in 1948 
dubceks return to official life at age 68 is regarded as 
historic justice in a country that made him one of communisms few 
idolized party leaders there even were dubcek fan clubs after the 
soviet invasion 
but popular demands for multiparty democracy suggest 
czechoslovaks will not settle now for what dubcek offered 22 years 
ago socialism with a human face 
dubcek said in 1968 he wanted to transform czechoslovakias 
hardline stalinist system into a kinder gentler form of communist 
rule that permitted free assembly and speech he said the 
communists should preserve their monopoly of power not through 
repression but by earning the right to lead 
dubcek ousted from party leadership and later from membership 
has not said whether he will seek reinstatement 
a prominent czechoslovakamerican ohio state university 
historian and journalism professor jiri hochman said the communist 
party has become irrelevant and dubcek must know it but he 
said knowing him i would guess he would like to get back in 
the party 
prague spring euphoria in czechoslovakia was marked by a 
series of cliffhanging facedowns between the dubcek camp and 
forces headed by soviet leader leonid brezhnev dubcek argued that 
reforms would rejuvenate rather than weaken communism 
even after the soviet invasion popular outrage in 
czechoslovakia enabled the dubcekites to hang on for months of 
struggle to preserve some freedoms 
support for dubcek upset soviet plans to install a puppet 
government and prompted the kremlin to bring dubcek prime minister 
oldrich cernik and other arrested prague leaders to moscow to 
negotiate their resumption of office and a forced program of 
normalization 
with a new slogan of we are with you be with us the 
haggard sadfaced dubcek made frequent television appearances 
cautioning his countrymen not to provoke the soviets 
he often broke the bad news about normalization measures 
that included ouster of popular leaders temporary basing of 
soviet troops in czechoslovakia and restored censorship 
some critics say today that dubcek gave in too easily failing 
to exploit his own popularity and the countrys solidarity 
dubcek never once drew a line on the rollback and warned the 
soviets not to cross it said dr jiri kotas a czech who has lived 
in exile in canada since 1979 and is organizing a conservative 
party to enter czechoslovakias promised free elections in june 
the kremlin slowly achieved the results brezhnev sought some 
said the prague spring really ended with the ice hockey riots 
in march 1969 
czechoslovakias victory over the soviet union in a semifinal 
match at the stockholm world championships unleashed pentup 
czechoslovak political feelings dancing in the snowcovered 
streets turned into antisoviet rioting 
moscow branded the episode a serious provocation and threatened 
to redeploy military force against civilians dubcek went on 
television with an urgent request for peace and discipline 
on april 17 1969 hardliner gustav husak replaced him as party 
chief and dubcek was demoted to federal assembly chairman 
ironically the same post he reassumed thursday 
in december 1969 dubcek was sent as ambassador to turkey 
passing up an opportunity to defect to the west he returned to 
czechoslovakia and in mid1970 was expelled from the communist 
party 
dubcek spent the ensuing years clerking and running a forestry 
office in slovakia

text of soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs 
new years address to the people of the united states as 
translated from russian by the official tass news agency 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
dear citizens of the united states of america i greet you on 
behalf of the soviet people and convey the words of hope to you 
the year 1990 can and must bring nearer a genuinely peaceful period 
of world history 
there are still both hesitations waitandsee attitudes doubts 
and suspicions but all this only reaffirms the crucial nature of 
the current situation 
the entire world proceeds ahead it wants happiness freedom and 
prosperity and it would be naive senseless and dangerous to try 
to thwart this aspiration for a better future 
we are deeply convinced that an epoch of peace is feasible we 
the soviet union and the united states it seems have already made 
a choice the choice in favor of cooperation 
during the malta meeting president bush and i agreed that it 
was essential to get away from the cold war and to abandon the cold 
war instruments as well so that 1990 and subsequent years could 
open up a period of genuine cooperation before us 
in that case in an atmosphere of greater trust we would begin 
to build a world ruling out subversive action pressure 
interference and armed invasions that do not credit either to 
weapons or politics 
we in the soviet union have begun to advance towards such a 
future this goal is served by our perestroika but we are 
convinced that all societies existing on earth are in need of 
reasonable transformation 
philosophers and historians maintain that the end of any century 
creates a special psychological atmosphere that combines nostalgia 
for the outgoing year uncertainty and even some fear about new and 
unknown and invariably hopes for a better life 
and still there is a great difference between people of the end 
of last century and the end of this century the main difference is 
that we realize that the stronger the hope the more vigorous and 
joint efforts are needed to translate it into reality 
i suggest making the 1990s a decade of the drawing of the united 
states and the soviet union closer together on the basis of 
universal human values and the balance of interests and together 
with all countries ridding the world of fears and mistrust of 
unnecessary weapons of outdated political concepts and military 
doctrines and artificial barriers between people and states 
the year 1990 could become a genuine turning point in the 
efforts to limit and reduce arms we on our part shall do 
everything for that 
at the same time our two countries could do much for further 
improvement of the overall moral and political climate in the 
world in this case one may have no doubt that we shall bring 
nearer the transformation of the world and will make it more calm 
and reasonable 
the 1990s may become a decade when freedom democracy and 
equality will begin to be established on a global scale and in an 
increasingly irreversible way 
people may say that all these are longknown truths and ageold 
values this is so indeed but never before were we prepared so 
well for implementing them as now at the turn of the 20th century 
let us work purposefully patiently and with belief in their 
triumph 
i want to wish good health and every success to all citizens of 
the united states i wish your children and grandchildren to become 
happy dwellers of the 21st century which will of course be better 
than ours if we combine our efforts for the sake of that 
i wholeheartedly wish all americans a happy new year 
thank you

determination on both sides i am confident our two peoples will be 
equal to the task 
he said such a dialogue took place at his recent summit in malta 
with gorbachev saying i told your president that i support the 
dynamic process of reform in the soviet union 
we will work together to reduce barriers to trade investment 
and the free movement of goods and ideas in these ways and as 
your economic reforms take place the entry of the soviet union 
into the global market can be advanced 
bush reiterated that the united states as well as nato allies 
seeks no advantage from the extraordinary changes under way in 
eastern europe 
a new year is dawning around the world the first year of the 
last decade of the twentieth century and as the world looks back 
to nine decades of war of strife of suspicion let us also look 
forward to a new century and a new millennium of peace freedom 
and prosperity the president said

stores closed and buses and trucks stayed 
inside depots in this holy city monday in response to a strike 
called by sikh militants in punjab state 
the allindia sikh students federation claimed their strike was 
successful throughout punjab but punjabs top police official said 
traffic and business functioned normally in much of the northern 
state 
kps gill the states director general of police said there 
had been no reports of strikerelated violence 
the strike appeared complete in amritsar site of the golden 
temple the sikh faiths holiest shrine 
although new years eve is widely celebrated in india stores 
normally are open jan 1 since it is not an official holiday 
the sikh students federation which functions as the youth wing 
of the movement to create a separate sikh homeland in punjab 
called the strike to press demands for general amnesty for sikhs 
arrested since 1978 
they also demanded punishment for hindu rioters who killed more 
than 2000 sikhs in northern india in 1984 after prime minister 
indira gandhi was assassinated by two of her sikh bodyguards 
mrs gandhi was killed in retaliation for her decision to send 
the army into the golden temple to dislodge armed sikh separatists

constable who was dragged out of a new years celebration at his 
familys home in the village of ratta near amritsar 
the constable jaswant singh was shot and killed in a field 
early monday 
although the sikh radicals initially targeted hindus in their 
campaign of violence in the last few years they have attacked 
sikhs who do not support their cause 
the radicals have rarely called strikes to highlight their 
cause relying mostly on individual killings at night and 
occaasional massacres 
the police blamed at least 1821 deaths in 1989 on the 
extremists in punjab where sikhs are in a slight majority 
nationwide they comprise 2 percent of the population sikhs 
militants have accused the hindudominated national government 
cultural and political discrimination 
hinuds make up 82 percent of indias 880 million people

ethiopian rebels monday said government 
warplanes bombed two villages in the droughtstricken northern part 
of the country killing four people and destroying badly needed 
crops 
the rebel tigre peoples liberation front in a clandestine 
radio broadcast said four government mig23 fighter jets bombed 
the villages of adua and edaga hamus in tigre province thursday 
killing five cattle in addition to causing the civilian casualties 
and destroying the crops 
the barbaric act is aimed at subjecting inhabitants of the 
area to starvation said the rebel broadcast monitored in 
nairobi adua and edaga hamus are in northern tigre about 25 miles 
south of the border with tigres northern neighbor eritrea 
the united nations says crop failures in both provinces have 
left as many as 4 million people threatened with famine and 
estimates at least 700000 tons of emergency food will be needed to 
stave off starvation ethiopias government estimates only about 
18 million people will be threatened with starvation 
complicating the situation are two longrunning civil wars in 
eritrea and tigre that have placed many people behind rebel lines 
and beyond the reach of emergency aid 
ethiopias government two weeks ago said it had asked several 
indigenous agencies to study ways in which food could be delivered 
to those behind rebel lines in tigre and to submit a report this 
month 
the tigre peoples liberation front which took up arms against 
president mengistu haile mariams marxist government in 1975 
controls all of tigre and has moved south and west into neighboring 
provinces since launching a major offensive in september 
the rebels who also are marxists seek to oust mengistu and 
create a government modeled after the harsh rule of communist 
albania 
in eritrea the eritrean peoples liberation army has been 
fighting a 29year secessionist battle for their province 
rebel and government claims in the fighting are impossible to 
verify independently as reporters have been denied access to the 
northern regions

president vaclav havel who spent 
more than five years in jail for his political beliefs on monday 
declared a broad new years amnesty and reduced sentences for 
prison inmates 
it was not immediately clear how many prisoners would be freed 
under the amnesty or how many would benefit from sentence 
reductions 
havel declared the amnesty three days after he was elected 
president capping a peaceful revolution that ended 41 years of 
communist rule in this country 
the new years day decree applies to all prisoners with the 
exception of those indicted for abuse of authority of public 
official the official ctk news agency said 
that charge has already been levied against former prague 
communist party boss miroslav stepan considered responsible for 
violent police handling of a peaceful student demonstration on nov 
17 stepan was detained dec 23 and faces up to 10 years in prison 
if convicted 
stepan and excommunist party chief milos jakes have been 
expelled from the party for serious political mistakes but 
jakes so far has not been charged 
havel in his new years address said he was declaring the 
amnesty and reduction of sentences for humanitarian reasons 
there are many prisoners in our country who must live in 
jails that do not awaken the better part of what is in every 
human being and which humiliate people destroy them physically 
and spiritually havel said in the nationally televised address 
hours before the amnesty was declared 
at the same time i appeal to the prisoners to understand that 
40 years of improper investigations trials and jailing cannot be 
eliminated overnight he said 
inmates of at least 18 prisons staged hunger strikes last month 
protesting inadequate conditions 
havel himself spent more than five years in jail for his 
political convictions and is a known critic of the czechoslovak 
judicial system 
his decree reduces sentences for intentional acts by one third 
and sentences for criminal acts out of negligence by one half 
before he stepped down dec 10 former president gustav husak 
freed all those who opposition leaders considered political 
prisoners 
however opposition sources say at least six people are in jail 
on charges of espionage sentenced in secret trials on dubious 
evidence 
such sentences will be reexamined by the prosecutor general 
according to the text of the amnesty 
cases of terrorism murder rape and sexual abuse are excluded 
from the amnesty but all of these sentences are reduced by one 
year 
the amnesty wipes out all misdemeanor charges as well as 
suspended sentences including financial fines unless they stem from 
a criminal act 
havel asked the prosecutor general to reexamine sentences 
handed down to pregnant women mothers of children under 15 years 
of age old and handicapped people 
in a separate statement havel appointed pavol sitar the new 
prosecutor general

howard fogelman was shot seven times in vietnam 
losing all of his teeth and much of his confidence 
he now lives in the nations first homeless shelter for 
veterans sunday fogelman and 13 fellow residents felt the 
memories flooding back as they watched born on the fourth of 
july a new film about a wounded veterans struggle to cope 
the vets praised the oliver stone movie as they emerged from a 
showing of the film saying they identified with its portrayal of 
the isolation felt by veterans returning from the war 
but unlike reallife vet ron kovic played by tom cruise who 
leads antiwar demonstrators and finally feels at home by 1975 
fogelman and his colleagues are still waging their own war for 
dignity in america 
they feel they are losing 
at their shelter the veterans have curfews and other rules they 
say are better suited for children than former us servicemen 
some of whom have emotional wounds even though bullet wounds have 
mostly healed 
fogelman has a large dent in his face where a bullet entered 
and no teeth as a result of the shooting his last set of false 
teeth wore out two years ago and he says bureaucratic red tape has 
blocked him from replacing them 
without teeth he has remained jobless and homeless it has a 
lot to do with your confidence he said you dont want to 
talk 
drugs prescribed during his recovery from the facial wound he 
said led to a drug habit at home hes now in a methadone program 
and he suffers from posttraumatic stress which for him means 
you could just be sitting and you see images coming on the bus or 
the train 
he returned home in 1967 he said to a completely different 
country 
it seemed they were protesting everything especially the war 
it was pretty bad coming home im not bitter now in this country 
youve got to do for yourself fogelman said 
norman siegel executive director of the new york civil 
liberties union said he felt angry after watching the movie and 
hearing kovic say he felt he was home again 
i dont think these guys feel theyre back home yet they 
still have not reconnected he said 
its an outrage that theres not enough services and resources 
for the homeless veterans siegel said that ending is 1976 and 
its now 14 years later were beginning the 90s and youve got 
hundreds of thousands of people who are homeless and hundreds of 
homeless vets perhaps thousands and its not only in new york city 
but in cities across the country 
the group included two vets ben colon 36 and earl beddoe 41 
who have been on a liquid diet since dec 17 as a form of protest 
for better conditions at their shelter run by the salvation army in 
queens 
i believe we gave the best years of our lives veterans should 
never be homeless said colon who walks with a cane because of a 
war injury we need congress to remember our wounds are not 
healed yet 
the veterans are asking for a say in how the shelter where 400 
veterans stay is operated they say they are treated without 
compassion by the staff and note that only two of 80 on salary are 
homeless veterans they are asking for job training and homes 
its the quest for dignity said veteran kevin brown 29 
not that the country owes us anything but the country shouldnt 
forget thats all

sudans military leader called on 
southern rebels monday to agree to a third round of peace talks 
toward ending almost seven years of civil war 
adressing a rally marking the 34th anniversary of sudans 
independence attended by an estimated 150000 people lt gen omar 
hassan elbashir said he hopes 1990 will be a year of peace 
i call anew on the rebel movement to sit at the negotiating 
table for a third time to reach a peace forula accepted by all 
elbashir told the crowd in omdurman khartoums twin city across 
the nile river 
the revolution is determined to make this year a year of peace 
in sudan and to make the last decade in the century an era of 
reform and development by uniting the national efforts 
rebel leader john garang said on clandestine rebel radio that 
his forces would continue to resist sudans dictatorial 
oppressive and repressive military government 
representatives of elbeshir who led a coup that overthrew 
prime minister sadek elmahdis civilian government on june 30 
have held two rounds of talks with the rebel sudan peoples 
liberation army 
the latter one was in nairobi in november mediated by former 
us president jimmy carter rebel leaders and carter said the 
november talks collapsed because of conflicting points of view 
between the two sides and that no date was mentioned for resuming 
them 
but spokesmen for the government have said that while some 
issues were disputed positions acceptable to both sides were found 
for others the government officials said the two sides agreed to 
meet again 
on a recent tour of southern africa officials of the rebel 
movement urged the government to repeal islamic law lift the state 
of emergency announce a ceasefire and abrogate military pacts 
with other countries 
garang in his radio broadcast that was monitored in kenya also 
accused elbashir of insincerity in peace talks 
our experience in the talks confirmed that the junta does 
not have any program for peace and at the same time has rejected 
our proposals to form a broadbased government said garang 
garang a former army colonel who formed the rebel sudan 
peoples liberation army in 1983 said his forces would continue 
resisting the junta since it is imposing itself and its dictatorial 
policy on our masses 
in his comments marking the 34th anniversary of sudans 
independence as well as the new year garang called on all 
opposition movements in sudan to unite in their struggle against 
this dictatorial oppressive and repressive regime 
the rebels have been fighting sudans moslemdominated 
government for greater autonomy and economic reforms for the 
countrys predominantly christian and african south 
the rebels said no date was mentioned for resuming the 
negotiations however government representatives said the talks 
ended with both sides agreeing to meet again

the new year is bringing higher payroll taxes 
for workers and bigger checks for retirees as a longscheduled 
social security tax increase kicks in and a costofliving 
adjustment boosts retirement benefits 
the payroll tax is rising to 765 percent from 751 percent in 
1989 meaning employees will pay 765 to social security for each 
10000 of earnings subject to the tax 14 more than last year 
employers pay an equal amount for each worker 
the increase has been in the cards since 1977 when congress 
approved a plan to help keep the giant retirement program on sound 
financial footing that included the tax jump in 1990 
congress subsequently enacted a bailout package in 1983 that 
boosted the payroll tax from 715 percent to 751 percent in 1988 
without changing the 765 rate that already was planned for 1990 
the new year also means workers will start paying social 
security taxes on a bigger share of their earnings the payroll tax 
applies to income of up to 51300 in 1990 an increase from 
48000 in 1989 
the combined effects of the increased tax rate and the higher 
taxable wage base mean the maximum amount of social security taxes 
deducted will jump by 320 to 3924 for a worker who earns 51300 
or more 
social security taxes also are going up for the selfemployed 
who will pay 1530 percent in 1990 the combined employeeemployer 
tax rate 
the tax rate on the selfemployed technically was 1502 percent 
in 1989 but they got a 2 percent tax credit that automatically 
reduced the amount paid to 1302 percent in 1990 they lose the 
tax credit but for the first time they will be able to deduct half 
their social security taxes as a business expense the same 51300 
wage base applies 
the wage base has gone up every year since 1971 with the latest 
increase affecting about 104 million workers and selfemployed 
individuals who have earnings over last years maximum 
while 130 million workers and selfemployed people will be 
paying more into social security in 1990 389 million social 
security beneficiaries will start drawing bigger monthly benefit 
checks 
checks delivered on jan 3 will include a 47 percent benefit 
increase the biggest boost in 7 years the costofliving 
adjustment is designed to offset the effects of inflation in the 
past year 
the increase promises an extra 25 a month for the average 
retired worker who in 1989 received 541 a month the maximum 
monthly benefit for a worker retiring at age 65 in 1990 will be 
975 up 76 from the comparable figure for 1989 
the 47 percent benefit increase also applies to 45 million 
recipients of supplemental security income which provides a 
minimum income floor for poor people who are aged blind or 
disabled maximum ssi benefits will rise to 386 for an individual 
and 579 for a couple in 1990 up from 368 and 553 respectively 
in 1989 
since 1975 social security benefits have risen automatically 
each year along with advances in the consumer price index except 
for six months in 1983 that were skipped to help social security 
avert a financial crisis in earlier years benefits were increased 
sporadically by congress often in election years 
the 1990 increase in the payroll tax rate will be the 21st the 
payroll tax was 1 percent of income up to 3000 when social 
security started in 1937 it stayed there until 1950 and has risen 
gradually since then 
in addition to financing social security retirement benefits 
the payroll tax also finances survivors and disability coverage and 
most of medicare 
the social security administration maintains that the tax 
increase is needed to help the government build up the reserves 
that will be needed to help pay retirement benefits early in the 
next century 
social securitys trust funds grew by 59 billion in fiscal 1989 
to 169 billion and are projected to peak at 118 trillion in 
2030 when the reserves will be drawn down as the baby boom 
generation retires 
the higher taxes being levied now to pay social security 
benefits later dont sit well with everyone including the national 
federation of independent business which says the 1990 tax 
increase should be repealed 
the money siphoned away by this tax increase could be used for 
business growth and job creation said nfib president john sloan 
instead it will go to the trust fund where it can only tempt 
politicians looking for an easy way to reduce the deficit or fund 
another pet project 
the federation admits congress is unlikely to roll back the tax 
but is vowing to make it an issue on capitol hill

after two years of soaring homicide 
statistics district of columbia police hope a combination of more 
officers and increased community involvement will curb the carnage 
in the nations capital 
were sort of optimistic and we think we have the key 
ingredients to turn this thing around said police spokesman lt 
reginald smith were beginning to realize more community 
support and we need a lot of that if we are going to avoid setting 
another murder record 
washington became known as the murder capital of america after 
two consecutive years of recordsetting homicides the city of 
650000 ended 1989 with an unofficial total of 438 killings a 
record that topped the previous high of 369 recorded in 1988 
police have blamed drugs particularly crack cocaine for more 
than 60 percent of these deaths 
we still see drugs as a big problem but people in the 
community are beginning to be fed up and are patrolling their 
neighborhoods serving as the eyes and ears we need smith said 
in a recent interview we cant be everywhere and we need these 
people to stand up 
police chief isaac fulwood upon taking office last august 
immediately called upon citizens to get involved by alerting police 
to the whereabouts of murder suspects or when they witness a crime 
while smith said community patrols are beginning to work police 
are also pinning their hopes on the 1000 extra officers congress 
and the city have agreed to provide 
when we get those officers out on the street no doubt they 
will have an impact smith said we will increase our presence 
in neighborhoods where we are already active and improve coverage 
elsewhere 
the city has an authorized strength of 4055 officers but the 
new hires will increase the police force to almost 5100 officers 
smith said about 250 new hires are enrolled in the departments 
sixmonth training program while a nationwide recruiting drive is 
being conducted to find the rest 
the first new officers should hit the streets by early spring 
smith said 
the federal government is footing the bill for 700 new officers 
and will pay their salaries and benefits for the next five years 
while the city has included money in its budget to hire 300 extra 
police 
the city also will attempt to rehire retired officers to handle 
desk work in an effort to get younger officers out into the 
community 
but police have already learned that more arrests wont solve 
the crime problem more than 46000 people have been arrested in an 
antidrug sweep that began in 1987 but drug sales continue the 
same has been true for killings 
were not going to be naive and say this thing is going to go 
away overnight smith said it will take time to turn this 
around and really some sort of fundamental change in attitude 
where there is a respect for life

outstate michigan and 
political strongman won thumbs down honors as annoying phrases 
to avoid for the new year 
the 1990 dishonor list of words includes more than 60 phrases 
and words compiled throughout 1989 said researchers at lake 
superior state university 
outstate michigan got on the nerves of many state residents 
this seemingly innocuous word grates on my sensibilities like 
fingernails across a blackboard the implication being that 
detroit is michigan and the rest of the michigan land mass is out 
of the state wrote yvonne carlson of ludington 
political strongman was irritating to bill ziegler of troy 
this should be nipped in the bud before some university 
develops a new degree combining political science with physical 
education and weight training ziegler said 
other phrases that made the list included 
ethics bill congressional expression for pay raise 
wrote jerry jones of cincinnati 
drug czar how about antidrug czar wrote ruth hood of 
warren 
filmed before a live studio audience the alternative is a 
bit grisly hood also wrote 
rush hour why rush the traffic is barely moving wrote 
dave summers of holly 
all except entirety cant have a minus wrote ben szczesny 
of muskegon 
minor emergency clinic either something is an emergency or 
it isnt wrote carol mclendon of fort worth texas

restoration of the state capitol is going 
on nicely although theres evidence the father of michigan may be 
overshadowing the father of our country 
an xray of a 6footby9foot painting of lewis cass showed 
another layer under the cass painting 
there is a whitish area around cass head said maria 
quinlan leiby curator of collections at the michigan historical 
museum it tends to look like the white hair of george 
washington 
that was the first clue then researchers found that a portrait 
of washington disappeared after world war ii from the capitols 
inventory of artwork 
a discrepancy in the portrait of cass was first spotted a year 
ago by william seale a virginia historian who has written a book 
on state capitols and is a specialist in victorian furnishings 
cass governed the michigan territory from 181331 and is 
credited with preparing michigan for statehood he later became a 
senator and was the democratic candidate for president in 1848 
here is lewis cass in the setting of george washington 
seale said after viewing the portrait he said he recognized the 
background as being from the white house as well as noticing cass 
oldfashioned pose 
the xray exam was a routine part of the capitol restoration 
and the painting was sent in july to the detroit institute of arts 
for cleaning and repairs 
there has definitely been a change in the design around the 
head as there is a buildup of leadwhite paint said alfred 
ackerman a laboratory painting conservator there also appears 
to be more hair around the head as well as possible changes in the 
location of the eyes and nose 
leiby doesnt think the work was done over a portrait of 
washington preferring to think the overpainting was done to 
improve a bad likeness of cass she said cass dress and what 
washington wore also dont jibe 
the work is unsigned and both artists who are listed by the 
state to have done cass portraits are dead 
the art institute is to return the portrait this month to the 
senate mystery unsolved

thousands of soviet citizens rallied over the 
weekend to call for the disbanding of the communist party and to 
complain about worsening shortages of food and vodka activists and 
media reported monday 
in the azerbaijani capital of baku an activist said 3000 to 
4000 people demonstrated sunday to demand an end to the communist 
party which has reigned over the soviet union since 1917 and 
until friday was the only legal political party in the vast nation 
only lithuania has legalized alternative political parties the 
tiny baltic republic registered the first noncommunist party on 
friday 
in sverdlovsk in central russia citizens who have suffered 
extreme shortages of food and consumer goods in silence finally 
demanded action and got it according to the newspaper rabochaya 
tribuna communist party officials dissolved an unhappycrowd by 
flooding local stores with the missing vodka prompting the 
newspaper to wonder where it had been all along 
the anticommunist rally in azerbaijan was spawned by the 
downfall of the communist party in romania and the execution of its 
leader nicolae ceausescu according to local activist aidy 
amirbekov 
soviet media thoroughly covered the revolution in romania and 
the national television news editorialized in its coverage that 
ceausescu had diverted food and other resources from his people so 
he could live in style 
the sverdlovsk demonstration arose when a crowd of citizens 
upset because there was no vodka to be found in the stores even 
with their new vodka ration coupons gathered downtown and halted 
city transport friday rabochaya tribuna said 
regional communist party officials went out to soothe them and 
simultaneously flooded the local stores with supplies of vodka 
much of the crowd dissolved when the wouldbe shoppers rushed 
off to buy the vodka the newspaper said but some remained behind 
to complain because sverdlovsk residents have been unable to turn 
their ration coupons into meat sugar butter and other food 
products rabochaya tribuna said 
rationing varies from city to city in the soviet union in 
moscow only sugar is rationed but many items have become 
impossible to find 
sverdlovsk officials claimed the vodka shortage resulted from 
the fact that half the citys monthly supply had already been sold 
when the ration coupons were introduced in middecember but the 
newspaper said events proved the vodka was not sold out 
when people become indignant over standing in line for hours

copies of securitate files show with 
chilling clarity how a paranoid state spied on its citizens with 
telephone taps mail intercepts photographic surveillance and paid 
informants 
the copies obtained by the associated press record 12 years in 
the life of doru pavaloaie 48 an economist for a bus company who 
was denounced by a schoolmate because he wanted to leave the 
country 
the documents detail a pervasive system of internal espionage by 
the security agents of communist dictator nicolae ceausescu who 
was ousted and executed by the december revolution that ended 24 
years of his rule 
pavaloaies file began on july 13 1977 after his chance 
encounter on the streets with an old classmate a man with whom he 
felt comfortable talking about his wish to move abroad the lack of 
freedom in romania and his demand that ceausescu must give us 
food 
the schoolmate however was a paid informant codenamed geamparu 
who denounced pavaloaie in a document that also made allegations 
about the premarital sexual activity of pavaloaies first wife and 
referred to the wealth of her parents and her relatives in west 
germany 
geamparu identifies himself in the document as a former school 
colleague of pavaloaie 
doru pavaloaie does not have a job and lives like a parasite 
since the very beginning of the marriage both of them have wanted 
to leave the country and go to germany to his wifes relatives 
he wrote at a safehouse known only by the codename rosa 
pavaloaie in a telephone interview from his home in focsani 
120 miles north of bucharest said he later began to suspect his 
old friend was an informer 
i suspected him because the security servicesduring 
interrogations used some of my words when i talked with geamparu 
said pavaloaie 
early on the morning of dec 22 just hours after ceausescu was 
overthrown pavaloaie was among those who occupied the security 
forces headquarters in focsani 
beneath the headquarters the revolutionaries found an 
underground bunker with electronic eavesdropping devices arms and 
ammunition and boxes of security files stacked nearly to the 
ceiling 
pavaloaie said there were files on roughly half the adult male 
population of the city of 100000 people 
one of them was on pavaloaie himself and he took it home to 
have the documents photographed by freelance journalist livia 
axente who traveled to bucharest to make the copies available to 
the ap monday at pavaloaies request 
i wanted to give my name to american journalists in case 
something happens to me pavaloaie said 
he said he was frightened because army officers came to his 
house on sunday told him he could make copies if he wanted to but 
that he had to return the file to the security headquarters 
inside his file which contained three ledgers as thick as a 
fist he found reports from eight informers including geamparu 
the record of telephone taps copies of intercepted letters 
addressed to him and photographs of himself taken clandestinely 
over the years pavaloaie said he began to believe he was under 
surveillance 
i felt something was happening with my phone lines and when i 
walked down the street i felt like somebody was watching me but i 
couldnt imagine it was really happening he said 
copies of his file include documents from the interior 
ministrys department of state security seeking authorization for 
telephone taps 
one of those approved by a col p stoica covered the period 
may 23 1979 to nov 23 1979 
it said state security wanted to know the names and phone 
numbers of the people he contacted and if there are any 
discussions with characters hostile to communist party policy or 
our state policy 
it also sought to find the intentions of the target to 
illegally leave the country 
pavaloaie has been married to his second wife for a year and a 
half and they had a 5monthold boy he said eight months ago he 
applied to emigrate to israel with his jewish wife who has 
relatives in israel 
he noted that it was the first time he had ever officially asked 
to leave romania a desire he previously had confided only to close 
friends 
he said geamparu was one of those friends a man he had known 
since his schooldays and who made a living singing at parties and 
weddings and listening to the drunken talk of the partygoers 
inside his file pavaloaie said he found a document that 
identified geamparu by his real name but he said the document was 
not copied in the rush to photograph them for american journalists 
before being returned to security headquarters 
the copies clearly showed the letterheads of the department of 
state security or the local security forces 
the photographs of the ledgers showed them clearly marked 
socialist republic of romania internal affairs ministry 
information file for doru pavaloaie with the number of the file 
the volume number and the kind of information it contained 
the files outline in detail how the web of surveillance spread 
from the original target to all his friends and acquaintances 
they show the paranoia of a state that felt a need to listen to 
private telephone calls read the mail of its citizens follow 
then photograph them investigate them interrogate them and 
recruit their friends as informers 
the story of pavaloaie also points to the twists in 
revolutionary romania 
axente said geamparu is a man who really helped the 
revolution a man who used the amplifier he uses to sing at parties 
to rally the people on dec 22 
so far said axente nobody has confronted geamparu about his 
past as an informer he said that people are too afraid too 
uncertain about the political climate to denounce geamparu 
especially after the army ordered the return of the file 
the copies given to the ap included among other things 
transcripts from telephone monitoring geamparus denouncing of 
pavaloaie photocopies of intercepted letters and documents seeking 
authorization to tap his phone 
the dates on the documents stretch from 1977 up to the present 
pavaloaie said he wanted to make the documents public as a way 
both to protect himself and to fight against the system that had so 
brutally violated his privacy 
i saw all those young children killed by ceausescu they were 
only children and we are older men and we must fight to final 
victory pavaloaie said

bus fares and gasoline doubled and 
electricity quadrupled in price monday under a radical plan by the 
noncommunist government to transform polands centrally planned 
economy to capitalism 
poles fears of looming price increases were confirmed monday 
and finance minister leszek balcerowicz acknowledged hardships in 
coming months but stressed the increases were needed to halt 
polands 900 percent inflation to end its economic decline 
there are no solutions devoid of risk the official news 
agency pap quoted him as saying above all i would like to 
stress that despite the dangers and challenges we stand before a 
unique chance and it depends on us how we take advantage of it 
the farreaching plan is intended to supplant the centrally 
directed economy run by the communists during their fourdecade 
rule but there is concern that the economic shock will be too much 
for poles who earn an average monthly wage of 350000 zlotys 37 
were never going to be able to make it people arent going 
to be able to pay these prices said one cabbie at a warsaw gas 
station speaking on condition of anonymity 
the price increases come the same day as an earlier announced 38 
percent devaluation in the currency to the dollar took effect the 
devaluation was intended to close the gap between the official rate 
and black market rate the government also plans to make the zloty 
convertible to other currencies 
the price of coal a major source of heat in polish homes 
officially increased by 600 percent the cost of electricity by 400 
percent and the price of heating gas by 400 percent 
rail and intercity bus passengers found that the price of 
tickets had gone up an average of 250 percent while the price of 
municipal bus tickets doubled 
most gas stations were shut for the new years holiday but 
drivers who needed to fill their tanks learned that the price of 
regular gasoline had doubled from 1200 zlotys a liter 48 cents a 
gallon to 2400 zlotys a liter 96 cents a gallon 
the price raises form part of a radical economic program backed 
by the solidarityled government that was passed by parliament last 
week included in the program is a law regulating salary increases 
balcerowicz whose plan is supported by the world bank the 
european economic community and major western governments told pap 
that the difficult times coming were unavoidable but delays in 
applying the plan would hurt poles even further in the long run 
in the next few months we expect limitations on income but 
without this it is impossible to check inflation balcerowicz 
said 
until now wages have been pegged to inflation but enterprises 
will have less money to pay workers under reduced state subsidies 
balcerowicz said that bankruptcies would occur as a result of 
the new policies but that the move to limit wage increases might 
reduce the scale of closures 
in august solidarity activist tadeusz mazowiecki became prime 
minister the first noncommunist head of a government in eastern 
europe since then democratic reforms have swept the east bloc 
and noncommunists have been installed as presidents in 
czechoslovakia and east germany

the baltic republics of estonia latvia and 
lithuania started their muchdebated economic independence programs 
monday taking control of factories and other elements of their 
economies from bureaucrats in moscow 
estonia underscored the potential of the reform by kicking off a 
contest to design its new currency the krona 
the newspaper rabochaya tribuna said the krona will be 
introduced next year and planners tentatively expect it to be fixed 
to the ruble at a onetoone rate for interregional trade 
but they plan for the krona to float against the ruble for 
tourist purposes the newspaper said 
details of the economic independence plans were still being 
hammered out at the last minute as officials of the republics and 
the national government in moscow argued which powers would be 
decentralized 
the baltics with their more recent experience with capitalism 
than the rest of the soviet union favor much more drastic economic 
reforms than moscow including legalization of private property 
the three republics were independent nations between the two 
world wars until they were annexed by the soviet union in 1940

stinging portuguese menofwar are rubbing tourists 
the wrong way on the beaches of southeastern florida 
hundreds of beachgoers have been stung by the pinkandblue 
jellyfishlike creatures in recent days from palm beach south to 
miami beach and key biscayne 
i had 20 people stung right in front of me miami beach 
lifeguard mike hoover said sunday 
were getting invaded here said hollywood lifeguard louis 
desimone 
bruce koski of the fort lauderdale beach patrol said the stings 
which sometimes are compared to an electric shock were to be 
expected 
its the time of year for the manofwar and they have a very 
painful sting he said the stings are treated on the beach with 
salves 
people are stung when they unknowingly step on menofwar 
tentacles while walking along the shore or when they brush against 
them while swimming 
on sunday alone 350 bathers at hollywood 330 in fort 
lauderdale and nearly 300 on palm beacharea beaches reported 
stings 
seasonal southeasterly winds the same that bring balmy breezes 
in from tropical seas to the south are to blame causing 
congregations of jellyfish along lee shores 
the balloonlike body of a manofwar floats on the surface and 
is easy to see but the tentacles sometimes 25 or 30 feet long 
waft in the current and are difficult to avoid when caught in the 
surf the creatures are often broken apart but their toxins remain 
active for hours even after being washed up on the sand

president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev on 
monday hailed the superpowers moves to thaw the cold war and 
exchanged hopes that they can work even closer to ensure a century 
of peace 
in a new years message to the soviet people bush said there 
are no maps to lead us where we are going to this new world of our 
own making 
as the world looks back to nine decades of war of strife of 
suspicion let us also look forward to a new century and a new 
millennium of peace freedom and prosperity bush said 
in a corresponding message to the united states gorbachev said 
he and bush have agreed to get away from the cold war and to 
abandon the cold war instruments as well so that 1990 and 
subsequent years could open up a period of genuine cooperation 
before us 
the soviet leader proposed further cooperation in the 1990s to 
rid the world of fears and mistrust of unnecessary weapons of 
outdated political concepts and military doctrines and artificial 
barriers between people and states 
the year 1990 could become a genuine turning point in the 
efforts to limit and reduce arms we on our part shall do 
everything for that 
soviet television broadcast gorbachevs greetings to the 
american people at 7 pm moscow time and followed it with bushs 
greetings to the soviets both greetings a new years tradition 
began by gorbachev and former president reagan were broadcast at 
11 am est on cable news network 
bush reiterated that the united states as well as nato allies 
seeks no advantage from the extraordinary changes under way in 
eastern europe 
we will work together to reduce barriers to trade investment 
and the free movement of goods and ideas in these ways and as 
your economic reforms take place the entry of the soviet union 
into the global market can be advanced said bush who is 
vacationing in texas but who taped the message in washington before 
he left 
neither of the two leaders who met in december in malta 
directly criticized the other but gorbachev referred to 
hesitations waitandsee attitudes doubts and suspicions 
toward cooperation 
the entire world proceeds ahead it wants happiness freedom 
and prosperity and it would be naive senseless and dangerous to 
try to thwart this aspiration for a better future 
bush referred to a respect for human rights and the sharing of 
democratic values and praised andrei d sakharov the human 
rights activist who died last month during a campaign to end 
communist supremacy in the soviet union 
your own leo tolstoy said that if our hearts are empty no law 
or political reform can fill them bush said these values 
belong to all men and women through all time and in all places

east germans began the new year on monday 
with the task of cleaning streets littered by fireworks and broken 
glass and repairing an economy sapped by four decades of communist 
mismanagement 
the first year of the 1990s will see the first free elections in 
east germanys 40year history but it will also determine whether 
it remains independent and sovereign or is merged with the wealthy 
west german state 
this is going to be a very full and important year said 
baerbel richter who strolled through the debrisstrewn streets of 
east berlin with her 5yearold grandson franciskus we have to 
be careful how we go about it 
freedom to travel has whetted some east germans appetites for 
the more comfortable lifestyles taken for granted in the west 
while others have resolved to protect the separate statehood of 
east germany against what they see as an attempt by bonn to buy 
them out 
debts and declining productivity may worsen if an exodus to the 
west continues to drain east germany of its skilled workers and 
hope for the future 
at least 320000 east germans relocated to west germany in 1989 
undermining the economy of the already laborshort socialist state 
of more than 16 million people 
reforms likely to devalue east germanys currency while boosting 
the price of many basic food and consumer items are under 
consideration as the interim government moves cautiously to 
introduce market principles into the planned economy 
in his new years message premier hans modrow appealed for 
broader financial support from west germany but continued to 
resist formal unification that could subjugate his nation to its 
capitalist neighbor 
the larger our economic problems the worse the climate will 
be for the elections modrow warned 
east germanys communist party will compete with new citizens 
movements and political parties in the may 6 balloting for 
parliamentary seats and a role in the national government 
czechoslovak president vaclav havel planned a trip to east 
germany on tuesday his first official visit to a foreign country 
since being named head of state friday 
in contrast with the unbridled overnight revelry the east 
german capital was nearly deserted during the short daylight on 
monay that was made drearier by a snowfall scattered by sharp gusts 
of wind 
the adn news agency reported that 52 million germans crossed 
the intergerman border over the holiday weekend including 37 
million between the two sides of divided berlin 
crumpled paper streamers charred sparklers and fireworks 
casings paved the streets and sidewalks of central east berlin 
where 500000 had gathered the night before to ring in the new year 
at least 135 people were injured and one killed during the 
raucous celebration when a tower of scaffolding near the 
brandenburg gate fell under the weight of revelers seeking higher 
vantage points from which to survey the scene along the berlin wall 
police from both east berlin and west berlin reported 77 people 
were taken to hospitals and dozens of others were treated at the 
scene

president vaclav havel on monday 
denounced the grim economic and ecological wounds left by 41 years 
of communist rule and pledged to lead his country to free elections 
in a televised new years speech the new noncommunist leader 
said he wanted the dalai lama and pope john paul ii to visit 
czechoslovakia and called for full diplomatic ties with the vatican 
and israel 
he also declared a broad amnesty and reduced sentences for all 
inmates except those imprisoned for murder or sex crimes or for 
officials who abused public authority 
also monday communist premier marian calfa said the government 
intends to adopt freemarket principles and increase ties with 
western europe the official ctk news agency reported 
we shall consistently part with the system of management that 
prevailed in our country for many years our strategic goal is to 
prepare the transition to a market economy ctk quoted him as 
saying 
the speech by havel a playwright and human rights activist who 
was jailed for five years by the former hardline communist 
leadership was the first since parliament on friday elected him 
president to culminate czechoslovakias peaceful revolution 
out of gifted and sovereign people the communist regime 
made us little screws in a monstrously big rattling and stinking 
machine we have become morally sick said havel 
our country does not flourish we have the worst 
environment in europe he said 
before world war ii czechoslovakia was an economic power in 
europe but it slid into stagnation under communist rule pollution 
from the heavy industrial plants fostered by the communists ravaged 
the environment 
we have to accept this legacy as something we have inflicted 
upon ourselves he said using vivid language that contrasted 
with the bland style of his predecessors 
havel said rivers of blood have flowed through many east 
bloc countries over the past four decades including romania in the 
past two weeks as their citizens struggled against communism 
these great sacrifices are a tragic backdrop of the present 
freedom or gradual freeing of nations of the soviet bloc that is a 
backdrop of our newly gained freedom too havel said in his 
28minute speech 
he emphasized the need to bring his country to free elections 
and renew czechoslovakias prestige abroad 
my first task is to use all my authority and influence so 
that czechoslovakia can have free elections soon and in a 
dignified way he said 
free elections for the nations 35oseat parliament are 
tentatively scheduled for june although no date has been announced 
i would be happy if even for just one day pope john paul ii 
and the tibetan dalai lama visited our country before the 
elections havel said and if still before the elections we 
managed to establish diplomatic ties with the vatican and israel 
as recently as two years ago the polishborn pope lamented the 
sorry state of the roman catholic church in czechoslovakia 
five czechoslovak dioceses lack bishops despite two years of 
negotiations between the vatican and the ousted leadership which 
sought to limit the churchs role in society 
however the new government has pledged religious freedom 
havels first gesture after his selection friday was to attend a 
thanksgiving mass about 65 percent of czechoslovakias 156 
million people are roman catholics 
the newly chosen president also said he would like to establish 
diplomatic ties with the vatican and with israel all warsaw pact 
nations except romania cut ties with israel after the 1967 middle 
east war 
hungary also in the grip of democratic change was the first to 
renew full ties in september and the soviet union and poland 
renewed lowlevel ties in the last three years 
last month poland and czechoslovakia said full ties with the 
jewish state would be renewed in 1990 
i want to contribute to peace also by my visit tomorrow to our 
two related neighbors that is the german democratic republic and 
the federal republic of germany havel said 
havel travels to both german states tuesday in his first trip 
abroad in two decades the playwright whose works were banned in 
his native country until recent weeks won several international 
awards but declined to attend such services fearing that communist 
authorities would not allow him back to his homeland

officials announced tentative agreement monday 
to end a violenceplagued 9monthold strike against the pittston 
co by 1700 coal miners in virginia west virginia and kentucky 
we can continue to try to scratch each others eyes out or we 
can accept a relationship where we can grow together united mine 
workers president richard trumka told a news conference in the 
office of labor secretary elizabeth dole 
trumka said it is unclear when miners will return to work but 
he said the agreement would be placed before the rank and file for 
ratification within eight to 10 days 
terms were not disclosed immediately both sides called it a 
victory for collective bargaining but said they want striking 
miners to hear the specifics first from union leaders 
in montgomery ala president bush issued a statement that he is 
delighted with the settlement bush on his way back from a 
fishing trip said i want to wish the families and communities 
of the mine workers a very happy new year as they look forward to 
the benefits of a new contract 
marathon bargaining between the umw and the nations largest 
coal exporter included a 96hour session just before christmas 
former labor secretary wj usery who served as mediator and vowed 
to find a solution over the holidays termed the dispute the 
toughest of his career 
at 1030 last night we had a handshake he said 
the strike was marked by mammoth labor rallies vandalism and 
rockthrowing confrontations between strikers and other company 
employees 
the union is currently facing fines totaling 635 million for 
violating court orders limiting picketing and other strike 
activities we hope that we can resolve all the outstanding 
litigation and charges usery said 
mrs dole said one of the most difficult issues was the 
longterm security of pension and health care benefits for miners 
and their families coal workers said the strike was prompted 
primarily by pittstons move to end its contributions to the umws 
industrywide retirement fund 
mrs dole promised to appoint a commission which will review 
all aspects of the pension and health care issue and make 
recommendations to me for dealing with it 
she and the negotiators said the commission was prompted by the 
need for a broad industrywide means of bolstering the pension 
fund she said the panel would report back to her in six months but 
its recommendations would not change mondays agreement 
the funds issue has been settled between pittston and the 
united mine workers trumka declared he said the provisions 
would stay in effect for the life of the agreement 
i think the members will be extremely happy with the agreement 
that is presented to them trumka said 
usery said the negotiators came to what i really belive is a 
reasonable solution to both sides it is fair it is honorable 
we hope and pray that it wont just be another bandaid but it 
will be something permanent 
we just couldnt be happier to stand before you today 
pittston co chairman paul douglas said we think weve met the 
essential objections of all those concerned 
the strike began april 5 as the bitterness grew 46000 mine 
workers in 10 states walked off their jobs in sympathy at one point 
pittstons coal subsidiary pittston coal group inc had said 
it could not afford to continue payments into the fund which 
covers 130000 pensioners who retired between 1947 and 1976 the 
company 560 of whose retirees are covered by the fund objected to 
making contributions to the pensions of thousands of employees of 
other companies 
the umw had said that other companies would attempt to escape 
from the fund if pittston were allowed to do so 
sen jay rockefeller dwva said in a statement im 
delighted the strike has been settled let me say that there is no 
threat to the pensions of the 125000 retirees across the country 
usery was named mediator by mrs dole in october after she 
visited striking workers in the coal fields of southern virginia 
strikers occupied a pittston processing plant in carbo va for 
several days in september and mines were blocked elsewhere more 
than 2000 strikers were arrested in the first three months of the 
walkout many for sitdown demonstrations and some for rock 
throwing three union officials were jailed 
wildcat strikers from other states joined bumpertobumper 
convoys to slow pittston coal shipments 
as the strike went on pittston hired replacement workers but 
production was well below prestrike levels the company said its 
coal operations lost 36 million in the second quarter of 1989 and 
98 million in the third quarter compared with profits of 9 
million and 74 million in the respective quarters of 1988

prime minister mudar badran won a vote of 
confidence in the kingdoms revitalized parliament on monday after 
telling the lawmakers he will end jordans 22 years of martial law 
within six months 
badran also promised to repeal the 1953 law banning communism 
to reconsider the 1957 law banning political parties and to review 
the cases of political prisoners for a possible amnesty 
the government is committed to fulfilling the constitution in 
its spirit and its letter and intends to abolish martial law within 
a period of four to six months badran said in his twohour 
speech 
more 1000 people packed the public gallery and cheered as 
badran spoke and women wailed in joy in a traditiional arabic 
celebration afterward 
the vote followed more than two days of debate in the new 
80member parliament which is determined to pry further reforms 
from the cabinet badran was named prime minister dec 4 his 
cabinet was appointed two days later 
at king husseins insistence the november elections were the 
freest held here since the early days of independence in the 
mid1950s 
only nine deputies voted against the government on monday and 
six others abstained such a vote is required for all new cabinets 
badran had already removed most powers from military courts 
which have considered everything from homicides to political crimes 
to pricegouging on vegetables since martial law was declared 
during the 1967 war with israel 
in that conflict jordan lost the west bank which held half the 
seats in the old parliament husseins renunciation of sovereignty 
over the territory last year in favor of the palestine liberation 
organization paved the way for election of a revigorated and 
expanded parliament 
the prime minister at times choking with emotion lashed back 
at those who alleged corruption during his earlier terms as premier 
in the late 1970s and early 1980s saying i am proud of my 
honesty and my proper dealings 
badran said his previous governments prosecuted hundreds of 
people on corruption charges 
he offered to give an account of his property and finances to 
parliament to answer questions raised by deputies about the source 
of his wealth 
the prime minister said he would lift immunity from prosecution 
from any minister or parliamentary deputy accused of corrution 
he also insisted he was proud of his past as head of the general 
intelligence department a background that has drawn fire from some 
deputies 
if you look at other countries you will see there is nothing 
wrong with this bush is a cia man he said referring to 
president bushs former post as director of the central 
intelligence agency 
deputies later said they would keep badran under scrutiny 
we will not hesitate to call the premier for a vote of no 
confidence if mr badran does not fulfill all his promises to us 
said nawaf khawaldeh an independent islamic activist 
badran won the votes of most islamic activists after promising 
to ban alcohol in all public institutions and at government parties 
he did not say monday if that ban includes flights aboard the 
stateowned royal jordanian airline as the fundamentalist moslem 
brotherhood demands 
he also stopped short of agreeing to the brotherhoods demand to 
ban liquor sales in all public places 
he said jordan will establish an academy for islamic law 
fortynine deputies rose to speak during the long debate and 
most demanded that the government accelerate a democratic trend 
that hussein launched in april after four days of rioting over 
price rises 
the government earlier reduced the general intelligence 
department power to interfere in passport and job permits and 
loosened controls on the press

that 71509 jews emigrated from the soviet union in 1989 the 
highest number in two decades 
of the emigrants 11994 have settled in israel the most since 
the early 1970s according to figures released by the jewish

left the soviet union in 1988 only 2173 settled in israel in 
1987 the figure was 2069 
israeli officials predict that 30000 to 50000 soviet jews will 
arrive in 1990 because of liberalized emigration laws and new us 
immigration restrictions 
the first 125 soviet immigrants this year arrived monday on a 
direct flight from moscow aboard israels el al airline making 
them the first soviet jews to immigrate directly to israel from the 
soviet union 
the immigrants had waited for 10 days to come to israel via 
romania they received permission sunday to join the return flight 
that brought israels habima national theater to the soviet union 
israel and the soviet union signed an agreement last month to 
begin direct flights between the two countries 
el al president rafi harlev greeted the 125 immigrants at the 
airport and said he hoped regularly scheduled flights will begin 
soon 
as many as 300000 soviet immigrants are expected in israel in 
the next three years the cost of settling the immigrants is 
estimated at 3 billion with us and other jews abroad expected 
to contribute 500 million of that

with police standing guard outside about 200 
people attending an naacp church program monday offered prayer 
song and humor in the face of threats issued on the heels of a 
recent series of mail bombs 
the new years day program at a southwest atlanta church began 
after a search by agents from the fbi georgia bureau of 
investigation and atlanta police including bombsniffing dogs no 
explosives were found 
the annual naacp program commemorating the emancipation 
proclamation was one of several held across the nation but 
attracted special attention because atlanta is the center of an 
investigation of bombings that last month killed a federal judge 
and an attorney 
the fbi refused monday to comment on the progress of the 
investigation a letter to an atlanta television station disclosed 
last thursday claimed responsibility for the bombs and threatened 
to kill two naacp members 
narvis grier the former longtime executive secretary of the 
atlanta naacp said threats of violence always have been a part of 
the organizations history 
the naacp is the oldest the largest the most hated and the 
most respected civil rights organization she told the gathering 
at hoosier united methodist church 
the rev richard wynn pastor of hoosier said some people who 
might normally attend emancipation day events called him monday 
morning to say they would not be coming this year because of the 
threats the crowd in attendance though wildly enthusiastic in 
their response to the program did not fill the church 
in light of what has happened it was an appropriate 
turnout wynn said after the program 
killed in last months bombings were 11th us circuit court of 
appeals judge robert vance and robert robinson of savannah a black 
lawyer who worked with the naacp 
two other bombs one to a federal courthouse in atlanta and one 
to an naacp office in jacksonville fla were intercepted before 
they could explode 
the atlanta police sent four patrol cars with officers to stand 
guard outside the church during the 3hour service which included 
a sermon hymns by the wheat street baptist church choir and 
speeches most of which made reference to the bombings 
dr otis w smith president of the atlanta naacp chapter said 
monday mornings search was done as a precaution rather than in 
response to a specific threat 
they assured us everything was all right before we came in 
smith said 
from the pulpit wynn asked for prayers for the sick minds and 
twisted spirit responsible for the recent violence he and other 
speakers vowed there would be no intimidation 
mondays program marked the anniversary of the date in 1863 when 
the emancipation proclamation took effect president abraham 
lincoln issued the proclamation the previous year to free slaves in 
states then at war with the union

central committee building and pick up the ceausescus on dec 22 
after they were booed on a balcony by tens of thousands of people 
assembled below in palace square

bobu was a highranking politburo member maria manescu was the 
wife of manea manescu a senior party official and one of

aircraft made for snagov a village north of bucharest where the 
ceausescus had a summer residence 
two security officers were also on board malutan told the paper 
mrs manescu and bobu reportedly the no 3 in the party 
hierarchy were asked to leave the helicopter at snagov

guard the daily reported it also quoted him as saying ceausescu 
ordered him not to contact ground control 
from snagov the helicopter left for a military airport in titu 
18 miles northwest of bucharest after ceausescu and his wife elena 
apparently decided to flee the country 
but as they approached the airport malutan said he told 
ceausescu they possibly had been tracked by radar according to the 
daily

ordered malutan to land away from airfield and his bodyguards 
hijacked a private car and its driver the pilot was quoted as 
saying 
the french daily liberation quoted nicolae petrisor an employee 
at a merchandise distribution center in tirgoviste west of the 
capital as saying in an interview saturday that the ceausescus 
forced him to drive them around the surrounding area for hours 
seeking a safe hiding place 
the dictator in the front seat of petrisors black dacia car 
was often in tears petrisor was quoted as saying 
the ceausescus were finally apprehended by workers at a factory 
near tirgoviste and were handed over to the army the paper said

a barge loaded with 100000 gallons of 
gasoline hit a bridge and ruptured monday spilling about 10000 
gallons into the icechoked monongahela river 
the barge was one of at least 50 to break loose from moorings 
along a 40mile stretch of the river from brownsville north to 
pittsburgh 
the leaking barge owned by gutman oil co in charleroi broke 
loose about 830 am hit the monongahela bridge and ruptured 
about 15 miles south of pittsburgh 
emergency crews tied the barge to shore and planned to pump the 
gasoline into an empty tanker only one compartment of the barge 
was ruptured so there was little danger of all 100000 gallons 
spilling into the river 
meanwhile rising water on the river from a weekend thaw forced 
about 200 people to temporarily evacuate their homes monday near 
maxwell about 30 miles south of pittsburgh 
another gasoline barge was hung up in charleroi near 
monongahela but state environmental officials said the river was 
so high that crews could not get near the barge to determine if it 
was leaking 
local health officials and water companies were notified of the 
spill estimated at 10000 gallons but no contamination of water 
supplies was reported said betsy mallison a spokeswoman for the 
state department of environmental resources 
pittsburghs water supply was not in danger from the spill 
because it draws water from the allegheny river 
several miles south of mondays spill about 25 coal barges 
broke loose and piled up at a dam an additional dozen barges broke 
loose in pittsburgh and floated into the ohio river three of those 
barges were stuck under a bridge in downtown pittsburgh forcing 
state department of transportation crews to close the span to 
traffic 
were afraid that ice and debris will pile up behind the 
barges damming up the channel said dick skrinjar a state 
transportation spokesman 
state police reported that a barge sank somewhere between 
dunlevy south of charleroi and new eagle just north of 
monongahela but officials had no details

president chaim herzog stepped into the 
government crisis on monday and suggested a compromise that may 
help prevent the collapse of the cabinet coalition of the likud and 
labor parties 
both sides sought an end to the crisis set off when prime 
minister yitzhak shamir head of likud fired science minister ezer 
weizman of the centerleft labor party because of weizmans 
supposed contacts with the palestine liberation organization 
israel regards the plo as a terrorist organization and refuses 
to negotiate with it 
herzog told shamir in a private meeting that accusations of this 
sort called for a proper legal inquiry to examine the facts 
political sources said 
israel television said herzog suggested weizman be allowed to 
remain science minister until the inquiry is completed but labor 
party leader and vice premier shimon peres quickly rejected this 
saying the damage had already been done 
the presidency is a mainly ceremonial position and it is unusual 
for herzog to become involved in political affairs a spokesman at 
herzogs residence said they do not publicize information from 
private meetings 
leaders of both sides have said they do not want to see the 
government fall over the issue but rabbi yitzhak peretz of the 
shas party who is trying to mediate said he saw no way to prevent 
the collapse 
its hard to say i see a way out peretz said on israel 
radio yesterday i did now i dont i can only say im sorry 
because the price will be paid by the israeli people and the 
government 
collapse of the yearold government could be the final blow to 
israels peace plan which calls for elections in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip as a step toward autonomy for the territories 
the army meanwhile confined 11 million palestinians in the 
occupied lands to their homes to block violence on the 25th 
anniversary of the founding of fatah the mainstream faction of plo 
chief yasser arafat 
despite the curfew throughout the gaza strip and in several 
large towns in the west bank palestinians marked the day by waving 
posters of arafat honking car horns or flying outlawed 
palestinian flags 
in aram six miles north of jerusalem allah bader ez eddin 
alhatib 17 was fatally shot in back when troops fired to 
disperse about 50 masked youths holding a parade the army said 
police used tear gas and rubber bullets to break up a 
stonethrowing protest by about 150 palestinians in shufat village 
within jerusalems boundaries police spokesman uzi sandori said 
four palestinians were reported shot or beaten in clashes with 
soldiers in the gaza strip arab reporters said 
some labor and likud leaders were trying to work out a 
compromise monday to save the coaltion an aide to shamir said 
like other political sources he spoke on condition of anonymity 
after shamir announced weizmans firing on sunday labor 
demanded that he rescind the dismissal which takes effect tuesday 
shamir has been under increasing pressure from labor party 
officials and from his own likud bloc to present weizman with the 
evidence against him justice minister dan meridor of likud said 
on israel tv he believed weizman would resign once the facts were 
presented before him 
sources in the labor party said their backing for weizman could 
change if shown the evidence against him israel radio said 
however labor leaders were reported considering joining 
leftwing parties in a vote of no confidence wednesday which could 
bring down the socalled unity government it was formed a year ago 
after inconclusive national elections 
peretz said on israel radio that shamir was refusing to agree to 
a compromise in which weizman would lose his post as science 
minister but would remain as a ministerwithoutportfolio in the 
26member cabinet 
both shamir and peres held meetings monday with leaders of four 
religious parties in hopes of persuading the small parties to join 
a new ruling coalition to replace the likudlabor government 
the religious parties have 12 seats in the 120member 
parliament giving them clout in deciding whether the 39seat labor 
or 40seat likud could form a narrow coalition

thousands of britons started listening to lady 
chatterleys lover as their bedtime story monday night complete 
with sexually explicit passages and fourletter words that have 
outraged antipornography campaigners 
the british broadcasting corp decided to go ahead with its 
15part radio adaptation of the unexpurgated version of dh 
lawrences novel despite efforts by the countrys leading tv 
watchdog mary whitehouse to keep it off the air 
in addition to broadcasting the first part of lady chatterleys 
romp down the primrose path with the gameskeeper bbc radio 4 
preceded it with a nearly 2hour reconstruction of the 1960 trial 
at which penguin books was charged with obscenity for publishing 
the sexuallyexplicit version 
both programs started with warnings they contained words and 
descriptions of sexual acts some listeners might find offensive 
it took 30 years from the first printing of lady chatterleys 
lover in florence italy to the celebrated penguin edition of 
1960 and another 30 years before that version was judged fit to be 
heard on radio the uncensored version was published in the united 
states in 1959 
the penguin trial gave the allclear for the books full 
publication in britain and was regarded as one of the key events 
that led to a more permissive attitude to sexual morality in the 
1960s 
the choice of the original lady chatterleys lover to launch 
the 42nd year of bbc radios a book at bedtime was one of its 
most daring in a highly unusual move the choice was approved by 
the bbc board of governors who dont normally get involved in such 
program decisions 
listeners to a book at bedtime have heard a wide range of 
titles from the classics to popular literature recent titles 
include the james bond thriller on her majestys secret service 
and john le carres the russia house read by the author 
the bbc says an average of 250000 listeners tune into a book 
at bedtime the audience is predominantly middleclass and over 
50 
lawrence said after he wrote lady chatterleys lover that he 
knew it would bring only abuse and hatred the bbc said it is 
expecting fresh protests 
of course some people are going to be offended but there 
isnt much i can do about that except not broadcast the book 
michael green controller of radio 4 was quoted as telling the 
sunday telegraph 
i think it is much too important an event in english 
literature to go on being overlooked as for the offending words 
well you can hear them on television most nights he was quoted 
as saying

coal group announced the tentative agreement monday after 
protracted bargaining sessions in washington dc over the 
holidays 
the violenceplagued 9monthold strike idled 1700 coal miners 
in virginia west virginia and kentucky at one point it sparked 
sympathy walkouts by 46000 miners in nearly a dozen states 
terms of the settlement were not disclosed with both sides 
saying they wanted the miners to hear details from their leaders 
umw president richard trumka said specifics should go to the rank 
and file within eight to 10 days 
i noticed they used the term tentative when they announced 
the agreement the miners will stay on the picket line until 
notified otherwise said howard green a umw international board 
member from charlestonbased district 17 
picket lines at pittstons logan county mines were not manned on 
new years day 
as far as tuesday picketing goes were taking it as just 
another day said roger nelson umw member from boone county and 
coordinator of camp solidarity ii in logan county 
miners drifted in and out of the camp monday while word of the 
tentative settlement circulated the camp was set up in a 
vacant department store to give miners their families and 
supporters a place to congregate sleep and eat over the holidays 
larry ward president of umw district 6 covering ohio and west 
virginias northern panhandle welcomed the tentative settlement 
and said it was worth the sacrifice 
its just a matter of whether you fight for the people who 
gave us this union or just throw them away like the companies do 
ward said 
in virginia striking miners said they hoped they will be back 
on the job soon 
well be receptive to it probably said jack bartee a 
26year veteran of the virginia mines and one of a handful of 
striking miners at the socalled camp solidarity in russell county 
minutes after learning of the tentative agreement southwestern 
virginia miner freddie wallace got a telephone call from labor 
secretary elizabeth dole whom he met in october during her visit 
to the region 
she told me she hoped this contract would mean a happy new 
year and i told her it would said wallace 47 a 
thirdgeneration coal miner 
in kentucky striking miners were happy with the tentative 
agreement announcement said bobby roy justice of district 30 
everybodys just tickled that theres a contract 
logan county pittston miner everett street who served on the 
picket lines for eight months before the union moved him to camp 
solidarity ii said the strike couldnt be over soon enough 
im not real happy if youve been out of work nine months 
you cant be real happy street said he and others said theyre 
waiting to hear the terms of the agreement before making a judgment 
street nelson and local 1971 president dave collins predicted 
some friction between other company employees and the strikers if 
they return to work 
anytime you stand in front of a mack truck coming down on you 
nudging you it cant be peachy when you get back street said 
street was referring to attempts by pittston coal trucks to 
cross picket lines to reach the companys elkay mining co at slab 
fork 
collins said miners must remember that an agreement doesnt 
necessarily translate into employment 
we cant tell the company what mines have to stay open he 
said

twenty us diplomats that president 
daniel ortega ordered expelled in retaliation for the search of its 
ambassadors residence in panama by american forces left nicaragua 
monday night 
the diplomats refused to speak with reporters before they and 
their families boarded a commercial flight to miami 
nicaraguas sandinista government gave the americans 72 hours to 
leave the country and ordered the us embassy support staff in 
managua slashed from 320 employees to 100 on friday after us 
troops raided ambassador antenor ferreys home in panama city 
us officials said the troops were searching for weapons and 
courteously withdrew about four hours after they arrived when 
they learned it was a diplomatic residence a us army colonel in 
charge of the operation later apologized and returned rifles that 
had been confiscated ferrey said 
president bush in texas on vacation also apologized for the 
incident but expressed wonder at the amount of arms found inside 
the residence 
the us state department called nicaraguas retaliation an 
irresponsible overreaction 
ortega described it as a very moderate response 
the departure leaves the embassy with 15 diplomats the minimum 
that a host government can restrict an embassy under international 
agreement and nine marine guards 
the incidents raised tension between the united states and 
nicaragua less than two months before the scheduled feb 25 general 
elections 
nicaragua views the panama invasion as proof of its assertion 
that the united states may invade it to oust the leftist sandinista 
government

president guillermo endara said 
monday that gen manuel antonio noriega doesnt merit shelter in 
the house of god and urged the vatican to expel the former 
dictator so us forces could take him into custody 
the white house meanwhile said the first american troops to 
return home since the invasion began dec 20 left panama on monday 
two artillery batteries totaling 141 soldiers from fort ord were en 
route to california press secretary marlin fitzwater told 
reporters aboard air force one 
the president is glad to see some of the troops coming home 
and hopes the rest can leave as soon as possible fitzwater said 
fourteen thousand troops were rushed in at president bushs 
order to join 12000 troops permanently stationed in panama 
in a related development 20 us diplomats left nicaragua on 
monday night for miami after they were expelled by president daniel 
ortega ortega gave the diplomats 72 hours to leave the country in 
retaliation for the search friday of its ambassadors residence in 
panama city by us forces 
bush apologized for the incident but noted the troops were 
searching for weapons and found numerous in the residence of 
ambassador antenor ferrey including rifles and uzi machine guns 
us officials returned the weapons after learning the home was a 
diplomatic residence 
endara said panama lacked a secure enough prison to hold noriega 
on criminal charges but that he would like to see noriega tried in 
panama after the united states prosecutes the general on drug 
trafficking charges 
only after the american authorities are done can we have 
the opportunity to extradite him to panama and make him pay in 
panama for the crimes and offenses he has committed here in 
panama endara said after a new years day mass but for the 
moment we cant do it 
noriega greeted the new year shuttered in the vatican embassy 
compound where he sought sanctuary dec 24 four days after a us 
invasion toppled his government 
on sunday night about 200 people held a silent candlelight 
vigil outside the embassy praying that noriega would be brought to 
justice 
in an interview the roman catholic archbishop of panama said it 
was up to noriega to decide on his own to leave his vatican asylum 
the image of us pushing him out the door isnt what we would 
expect said monsignor marcos gregorio mcgrath he will have to 
leave by his own decision 
mcgrath said the united states could offer noriega greater 
personal security and a fair trial 
he will have to weigh his choices and come up with that which 
is the least disagreeable mcgrath said at his home 
meanwhile the us southern command which oversees military 
operations in central and south america said it arrested rodolfo 
papito chiari a close noriega crony who also served as his 
interior and justice minister on saturday the military communique 
gave no details 
the southern command also said 50 members of the machos del 
monte battalion of noriegas defense forces surrendered sunday 
near rio hato 80 miles southwest of panama city 
endara said the impasse could end if the vatican and the papal 
nuncio say once and for all that noriega doesnt deserve to be 
sheltered in the house of god that he is a common criminal of the 
worst kind and should abandon the sacred place 
he again appealed to monsignor sebastian laboa the papal 
nuncio to turn over noriega 
ive only asked the nuncio to throw him out of the nunciature 
what happens outside is another matter said endara of course 
i must admit that when he is outside he will fall in the hands of 
the united states not because the nuncio will give him to the 
united states but because the embassy is surrounded by us 
soldiers 
noriega was indicted in 1988 in florida on drug trafficking 
charges 
noting that its panama city embassy is accredited to the 
panamanian government and not us forces the vatican has not 
released the general where he would be apprehended by us troops 
that ring the embassy 
the vatican also insists that panama has not made a formal 
request for custody of noriega 
but vatican officials have indicated they are eager to see the 
general leave 
on sunday attorney general rogelio cruz said panama would file 
murder charges against the ousted dictator in connection with the 
alleged execution of 10 officers who tried to oust noriega in a 
botched coup oct 3 
the filing of murder charges in panama could give the vatican 
grounds to turn him out and resolve the diplomatic stalemate 
if noriega did emerge from the embassy mcgrath said panama 
would not take him to avoid the question of whether to extradite or 
not to extradite 
many countries including panama have laws against extraditing

four decades 
interim president ion iliescu promised political pluralism and a 
shorter workweek reestablished private ownership of land and 
suspended wasteful construction projects in progress under toppled 
dictator nicolae ceausescu 
romanian radio reported no incidents of sniper fire or clashes 
between the army and diehard secret police loyal to ceausescu 
indicating a return to peace following two weeks of unrest that 
claimed thousands of lives 
people dressed in black lighted candles in central romana square 
for their relatives and friends who died in the revolution 
another death in bucharest was that monday of deputy foreign 
minister cornelieu bogdan 68 who was ambassador to the united 
states under the communist regime relatives in washington 
reported they said he had a history of heart trouble and was 
believed to have died of an aneurysm at work 
just sunday bogdan told reporters in bucharest the communist 
party is dead and no danger existed of communists returning to 
undisputed power here 
in a new years address carried by the official news agency 
agerpres iliescu announced the end to capital punishment saying 
ceausescu and his wife elena were the last persons who deserved 
this fate 
the ceausescus were found guilty of genocide during their 
24year rule and were executed on dec 25 
iliescu also reestablished the right to own private property 
with farmers again permitted to own about an acre of land 
surrounding their houses he said farmers could lease more land 
with its yield also sold on the private market in the past the 
state was the only buyer 
he said the workweek would be reduced from six days to five and 
he reiterated the governments commitment to introducing multiparty 
democracy after more than four decades of communist rule 
iliescus interim governing council of the national salvation 
front also signed a decree monday guaranteeing the right to 
repatriation of romanian citizens living abroad agerpres reported 
the news agency said the decree gave former exiles priority in 
buying housing with hard currency and allowed them to bring home 
goods bought abroad without paying duty 
iliescu also formally announced the abolition of securitate the 
secret police romanian radio reported 
hundreds of armed special police were still believed at large 
monday despite orders last week by the provisional government to 
surrender themselves and their weapons 
prime minister petre roman in an interview broadcast monday on 
romanian television said the governments priorities before 
planned elections in april were liberalization and changing 
laws 
roman also dismissed suggestions by fr3 a french television 
station that the revolution had been planned by leading dissidents 
he said the uprising was a spontaneous movement and a popular 
mass movement against the dictatorship 
the announced dismantling of securitate was preceded by the 
detention of the agencys former head gen iulian vlad along with 
three ranking members of the ministry controlling the police 
agerpres reported 
it did not specify what charges if any the four face 
maj ihai lupoi the new minister of tourism told a news 
conference in the first days general vlad worked with the 
revolution after four or five days he was arrested for reasons i 
dont know 
lupoi also said ceausescus villa and its secret tunnels might 
be opened to tourists 
the death toll from the revolutions two turbulent weeks remains 
uncertain 
one western diplomat said he had information that indicated 
about 7000 people had died our best estimate is nowhere near 
what the government says he said estimates at one point reached 
as high as 80000 
at least six new political parties have emerged since ceausescu 
was overthrown dec 22 by a nation outraged over the massacre by 
security forces of hundreds of people in the western city of 
timisoara participating in an anticeausescu protest 
iliescu is a former communist party secretary who fell out of 
favor with ceausescu for speaking his mind but has the political 
experience that dissident intellectuals and other former opposition 
figures lack 
his address comes ahead of the expected arrival in bucharest 
thursday of soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
a western diplomat said iliescu might discuss with shevardnadze 
the possiblity of allowing free travel across the sovietromanian 
border in moldavia a territory partly annexed by the soviet union 
in 1940 
iliescu also made available public agricultural production 
figures according to which the years cereal production amounted to 
169 million tons instead of 60 million tons claimed by ceausescu 
other totals also were well below claimed amounts 
to pay off the countrys foreign debt ceausescu had in recent 
years exported romanias best agricultural products while forcing 
rationing upon his people the new government is now opening 
warehouses and making those items available to romanians

government plans to charge manuel

of the deposed strongman 
president bush says he wants noriega behind bars in the united 
states to stand trial on drug trafficking charges panamas 
president guillermo endara sworn as us troops invaded to oust 
noriega has indicated hes not too eager to have the military 
ruler turned asylumseeker remain in panama 
but the vatican in whose embassy noriega sought sanctuary dec 
24 and greeted the new year has made it clear it is reluctant to 
turn out the general until all the niceties of diplomacy and 
international law are fulfilled 
up to now the main stumbling block has been the vaticans 
insistence that it cannot hand over noriega to the united states 
which it considers an occupying power in panama 
it says it considers its embassy accredited to deal only with 
the panamanian government which it insists has not made a formal 
request for custody of noriega

workers will pay higher payroll taxes and 
retirees will get bigger social security checks in the new year as 
a longscheduled tax increase kicks in and a costofliving 
adjustment boosts retirement benefits 
the payroll tax rises from 751 percent in 1989 to 765 percent 
in 1990 meaning employees will pay 765 to social security for 
each 10000 of earnings subject to the tax 14 more than in 1989 
the increase has been in the cards since 1977 when congress 
approved a plan to help keep the giant retirement program on sound 
financial footing that included the tax jump in 1990 
congress subsequently enacted a bailout package in 1983 that 
boosted the payroll tax from 715 percent to 751 percent in 1988 
without changing the 765 rate that already was planned for 1990 
the new year also means workers will start paying social 
security taxes on a bigger share of their earnings the payroll tax 
applies to income of up to 51300 in 1990 up from 48000 in 1989 
the combined effects of the increased tax rate and the higher 
taxable wage base mean the maximum amount of social security taxes 
deducted will jump by 320 to 3924 for a worker who earns 51300 
or more employers match their workers contributions

diplomatic sources say china was being careful to avoid a public 
break with the soviet union and other fastchanging socialist 
states by stressing that china never interferes in the internal 
affairs of other nations 
the sources say open disapproval of the upheavals in east europe 
would show the chinese people how isolated their hardline leaders 
have become from the popular reforms sweeping the socialist world

drug enforcement administrator john c lawn 
generally keeps a low profile he speaks in a quiet husky voice as 
he guides the actions of agents throughout the world trying to 
keep them safe in the field and supported in washington 
but when a miniseries on the 1985 murder in mexico of dea agent 
enrique kiki camerena airs on nbc in january he could become 
something of a national hero 
the miniseries depicts lawn tangling with mexican officials who 
stonewall efforts to find camarena and his killers and going 
public to criticize those officials over the objections of reagan 
administration officials 
at the conclusion of a national archives screening a chokedup 
lawn told the audience of about 100 dea and mexican embassy 
officials that it was an extraordinary piece of work

an electronic peephole that displays the 
telephone number of incoming calls is worrying defenders of privacy 
rights and stirring concern on capitol hill 
but others say the new gadget will shortcircuit nuisance calls 
and will be a boon to law enforcement 
the new service is known as automatic number identification or 
caller id and is being offered for about 650 a month plus 
another 60 to 80 for a small viewing device that flashes an 
incoming number before the phone is answered 
businesses love it but privacy advocates say its big brother 
and will lead to phone prefix discrimination and other social 
ills as people selectively decide what calls to answer or to ignore

no cover needed president bush said of his 
new years vacation hed earned it with hard work even so 
presidents and their imagemakers always are at pains to point out 
the press of daily duty that travels with them 
so it was as bush took his customary endoftheyear break in 
texas a holiday that ended monday night he said there had been no 
reason to change it because of us intervention in panama bush 
spent new years weekend in houston flying to san antonio on 
sunday to visit wounded servicemen at two military hospitals 
things have gone well its winding down he had said as his 
vacation began last wednesday i am in close touch by very 
close touch by telephone by secure links 
and the secretary of state is here and we have some important 
things to go over so i it never occurred to me he told a 
questioner at an airport news conference 
now if the matter were still going and there was a lot of 
fighting and noriega was not in custody it would have been 
different but i look i dont make any cover 
im going to be enjoying myself and i think the american 
people understand that and i think ive worked pretty hard all 
year long so ill keep on this path and i hope its correct 
then bush and secretary of state james a baker iii went fishing 
and hunted quail as they have for 20 years at the ranch of a 
mutual friend near beeville texas 
out of town and off work but never out of touch his spokesman 
said this administration like its predecessors misses no 
opportunity to point out the rigors of the job and the way they can 
be handled far from washington on business or pleasure 
he receives intelligence briefings every morning and of 
course a continual stream of paperwork that includes reports from 
the state department and the pentagon and other agencies of 
government white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
the president also has a secure telephone system there at 
the ranch and is able to make telephone calls on a secure basis to 
leaders around the world and other members of the administration 
he has with him his military aide and his personal aide who also 
maintain contact with various officials of government 
we always take the position that the presidency goes with the 
president but be that as it may certainly the president is able 
to respond to any international situation at any time fitzwater 
said 
just then a telephone rang interrupting his briefing 
and there he is now fitzwater cracked tell him im 
busy 
bush spent his summer vacation 20 days of it at kennebunkport 
maine displaying his way of relaxing at top speed he went 
fishing golfing jogging boating played tennis played ball 
dined out all in a sort of semipublic summer break that 
contrasted sharply with the solitude some presidents have sought 
ronald reagan spent the equivalent of 11 months in the isolation 
of his santa barbara calif ranch during the eight years he was 
president 
the vacationing bush is more public and more active but he was 
out of the public eye and 60 miles from his traveling staff 
entourage during his three days at the lazy f ranch his hunting 
days began at about 6 am with written intelligence briefings 
before 9 he and baker were out after quail even on a foggy texas 
morning 
this man has eyes that can see through steel girders let 
alone fog fitzwater joked 
did he hit any 
the question went unanswered 
the white house has been sticking to announced schedules with 
adjustments but with no major changes or cancellations because of 
the panama situation as if to play down any air of crisis because 
of the military operation 
with one big break for the administration it worked just when 
the operation seemed to be facing unanticipated resistance gen 
manuel antonio noriega the ousted military boss emerged from 
hiding and took refuge at the vatican embassy 
but the businessandholidayasusual schedule did produce one 
bad televised scene bush about to leave for a camp david 
christmas weekend bantered with reporters following a white house 
press conference meanwhile split tv screens showed the 
flagdraped coffins of american servicemen arriving home from 
panama
