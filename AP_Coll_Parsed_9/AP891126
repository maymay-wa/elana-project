opposition candidate rafael 
leonardo callejas took the lead sunday in early returns as 
hondurans voted in the nations third free presidential election of 
the decade 
initial unofficial returns representing about 9 percent of the 
precincts gave national party candidate callegas 89360 votes to 
79445 for carlos flores running for the governing liberal party 
the returns were broadcast by honduran television 
the people want to vote and it makes me proud to be a 
honduran today callejas said shortly before the polls closed at 
6 pm 
surveys had indicated callejas was a slight favorite 
election day was peaceful and officials placed the voter turnout 
at about 85 percent people went to the polls in flagdecked 
trucks buses and cars and on foot and horseback 
honduras is sandwiched between civil wars in el salvador and 
nicaragua and a formidable task for the new president will be how 
to deal with thousands of nicaraguan rebels living in border bases 
in honduras and a half million war refugees 
flores said in a radio interview before the vote tally began 
we are very optimistic were getting a very good turnout among 
our supporters 
flores 39 is publisher of la tribuna one of the nations 
leading newspapers and was trained as an engineer at louisiana 
state university his wife mary is a us citizen 
callejas 46 comes from a landowning family and was trained as 
an agricultural economist at mississippi state university 
if callejas takes office for a fouryear term jan 27 it will 
mark the first transition of power to an opposition party since 
1932 sundays was also the nations third free presidential 
election of the decade after years of militarydominated rule 
both major candidates have relatively conservative economic 
views and prous foreign policies although both also agree that 
ussupported nicaraguan rebels should move out of honduras 
however neither has an idea for getting them to leave 
two other candidates enrique aguilar paz of the social 
democrats and efrain diaz arrivillaga of the cristian democrats 
had loyal but small followings 
also at stake were three vice presidential posts a 128seat 
unicameral congress and 289 mayoralties voting was by party slate 
with no ticket splitting allowed 
the major issue in the campaign was the bad economy and 
unpopular incumbent president jose azcona hoyos weak liberal 
government azcona elected in 1985 is barred by law from seeking 
another term 
half a million refugees fleeing civil wars in neighboring el 
salvador and nicaragua have sharpened economic problems that 
include per capita income of only about 500 a year high 
unemployment and inflation and little industry 
more than 22 million people were registered but voting was 
concentrated at a few locations and many in the countryside had to 
travel more than 20 miles to cast ballots 
because turnout was considered vital in a nation where party 
loyalty runs deep the parties launched intense getoutthevote 
efforts 
pickup trucks and leased buses sported blue flags for callejas 
red for flores both parties set up centers where voters could 
report and be taken to the correct voting box 
some people cant read the room numbers said leila martina 
vargas a national party pollworker guiding voters in kennedy a 
poor district of the capital 
at the university of honduras five miles east of the capital 
more than 31000 people were scheduled to vote at 104 polling boxes 
its peaceful now well see what its like when we do the 
count at six joked glenda yolanda molina ortiz a national party 
poll worker drawing a laugh from other poll watchers 
international observers said the biggest problem seen so far was 
bureaucratic about 50000 people were missing their registration 
cards or had the wrong ones 
antifraud measures included glass boxes to prevent ballot 
stuffing as well as a plan to count and report the vote quickly 
using fax machines to cut out the delays that might permit 
fiddling with results 
wide coverage by the nations aggressive radio and television 
stations was also expected to reduce fraud 
a military government fell in 1982 and azcona was elected over 
callejas in 1985 under a nowdiscarded procedure that gave azcona 
victory even though he had 225000 fewer votes 
azcona won because votes that went to three other liberal 
candidates were added to his column this year flores beat three 
challengers in a primary callejas faced no challenge

communist premier ladislav adamec 
opened unprecedented talks sunday with opposition leaders in an 
attempt to stem czechoslovakias mounting political crisis 
adamec met with playwright vaclav havel and eight other members 
of the civic forum that has mobilized hundreds of thousands of 
people in prodemocracy protests over the past week 
it was the first time top government leaders of the communist 
regime have met with a delegation of dissidents on tuesday adamec 
met with a group that included some opposition leaders 
havel presented opposition demands and the two sides agreed to 
meet again tuesday government spokesman miroslav pavel said after 
the onehour talks 
the opposition also demanded a parliamentary investigation of 
the nov 17 police attack on peaceful demonstrators in downtown 
prague complete press freedom and the release of more political 
prisoners pavel said 
adamec planned to speak later sunday to a mass rally by the 
opposition which drew half a million to a similar protest saturday 
in prague 
sundays discussions opened in a chandelierlit salon at an 
elegant prague restaurant and ballroom complex there was applause 
as adamec rose and shook hands with havel across a table decorated 
with a small red white and blue czechoslovak flag 
three other ministers and bohuslav kucera head of the 
communistallied socialist party that is now showing increasing 
independence joined adamec on the government delegation 
the civic forum delegation included prominent dissident vaclav 
maly a banned roman catholic priest and two figures who played a 
key mediation role over the past week composer mihal kocab and 
journalist mihal horacek 
the meeting preceded by a civic forum meeting with the official 
communist youth movement was part of a frenzied attempt by 
communist authorities to deal with growing demands for democracy 
and avert a twohour general strike monday 
havel said on saturday that the general strike would go ahead as 
planned he described it as a national referendum on whether 
oneparty rule should continue in czechoslovakia 
pavel quoted adamec as saying the general strike is a reality 
we can hardly change now but appealed to all sides to avoid 
confrontation 
havels talks with adamec seemed intended to clarify the 
situation before the communist partys policymaking central 
committee holds its second emergency session in three days later 
sunday 
on friday at a marathon 16hour session the central committee 
tried to stem the crisis by dumping party chief milos jakes and 
other leaders associated with the hardline policies pursued since 
1968 when a sovietled warsaw pact invasion crushed the prague 
spring reforms 
but the shakeup was poorly received by czechoslovaks who 
rallied in the hundreds of thousands saturday to press their 
demands for genuine democracy

voters in four moslem provinces 
approved joining a new special region to enjoy selfrule but nine 
other provinces and nine cities overwhelmingly rejected the plan 
election officials said sunday 
the commission on elections certified results of a referendum 
held nov 19 in which voters throughout the southern philippines 
decided whether to join an autonomous government created to meet 
demands by 4 million moslems for selfrule 
president corazon aquino who signed the congressionally 
approved plan in august hoped the formula would end the 
20yearold moslem insurgency for a separate islamic state moslem 
rebels rejected the plan as inadequate 
the four provinces will constitute the autonomous region in 
moslem mindanao hilario davide chairman of the commission on 
elections told reporters after the count was completed 
critics have questioned whether the autonomous government will 
be viable the four scattered moslemdominated provinces that 
approved the plan are among the most impoverished in the country 
with poor communication and transportation they also are not 
contiguous 
the provinces of lanao del sur and maguindanao are on the main 
southern island of mindanao the other two sulu and tawitawi are 
islands scattered to the southwest 650 miles south of manila 
davide avoided commenting on criticisms that the plan merely 
would fence off a poor region the question of viability he said 
was for mrs aquino and congress 
among areas rejecting the plan basilan province and the cities 
of cotabato and marawi all are moslemdominated cotabato is 
maguindanaos provincial capital and marawi is the capital of lanao 
del sur 
in predominantly christian areas voters rejected the plan by 
margins as great as 40to1 
the final tally showed 5531 percent of the 35 million voters 
in the 13 provinces and nine cities voted in the referendum with 
72 percent rejecting the plan 
vicente delima executive director of the elections commission 
said some issues remain unsettled such as where to put the 
permanent seat of the regional government the law creating the 
region makes cotabato city the temporary seat but cotabato voted 
against joining the region 
the number of assemblymen also is in question delima said the 
law provides for three assemblymen from each voting district but 
nonjoiners cotabato city and marawi both are parts of provincial 
districts 
nur misuari chairman of the moro national liberation front the 
main islamic rebel faction has said he would wage a holy war 
no matter how the vote turned out 
mrs aquino forged a ceasefire with the rebels in 1986 peace 
talks collapsed in may 1987 but the ceasefire generally has held 
talks broke down largely because mrs aquino refused the fronts 
demands to declare all 13 provinces part of the autonomous region 
without a referendum

waves of cambodian guerrillas broke 
through government positions on the outskirts of a strategic town 
near the thai border sunday and took control of most of it a 
guerrilla commander said 
at least 60 government soldiers and civilians in svay chek were 
killed in the attack sunday morning said gen pan thai chief of 
staff of the khmer peoples national liberation front 
we control 70 percent of the town of svay chek right now he 
said at prasat a command post near the thai border we will for 
sure take the whole town probably tonight 
the guerrillas said they intercepted radio messages in which the 
government defenders requested permission to withdraw at 11 am 
six hours after the latest guerrilla assault but were told to wait 
for reinforcements 
thai military intelligence sources confirmed most of the 
guerrilla claims 
the guerrillas said a convoy of government tanks trucks and 
armored personnel carriers withdrew south toward sisophon on sunday 
morning but halted after going about five miles 
sisophon a government military operations center about 13 miles 
south of svay chek is the guerrillas ultimate objective its 
capture would be the biggest victory of the 11yearold war against 
the vietnameseinstalled government 
the khmer peoples national liberation front and two other 
guerrilla groups allied with it are supplied by china and other 
countries the government is armed mainly by the soviet union 
guerrillas of the front captured areas north of svay chek in 
late september only days after vietnam claimed it had withdrawn 
its last troops from the country 
thousands of rounds of rockets and artillery have been exchanged 
in recent days as guerrillas advanced toward the town through the 
surrounding rice fields 
the guerrillas cut off the governments only remaining supply 
route to svay chek route 69 in fighting friday 
guerrilla commanders at the scene said the government thursday 
increased the number of defenders at svay chek to 2000 by trucking 
800 more soldiers just hours before route 69 was cut 
the guerrillas said they have opened infiltration routes by 
using sticks and knives to clear minefields surrounding the town 
men were assigned one square meter of ground each to dig up 
the mines during the night pan thai said 
he said his forces destroyed one tank and an armored personnel 
carrier with newly acquired swedish antitank weapons 
the guerrillas said more than 7000 civilians had been living in 
svay chek but most of them fled in recent days 
the guerrillas said they spoke with the government soldiers at 
svay chek during the assaults 
we will kill you if you dont leave now one guerrilla 
commander told the soldiers holed up in the southern part of the 
town 
you live in the jungle you do not know how to run the 
country the other side responded 
most of the war has been limited to a slice of territory 
bordering thailand the capital of phnom penh has been almost 
untouched by fighting 
but the khmer rouge who are allied with the liberation front 
claimed in a radio broadcast saturday they lobbed several grenades 
at a monastery and other areas of phnom penh on tuesday and 
wednesday 
some enemies were killed or wounded in these grenade attacks 
the enemies are in great alarm claimed the broadcast a text of 
which was seen in bangkok on sunday 
there was no way to confirm the report some previous khmer 
rouge claims of attacks on cities were proven false 
the khmer rouge ruled for nearly four years and committed 
widespread massacres before they were ousted by vietnams invasion 
in late 1978

an english professor who searched 
the world to complete a sevenvolume collection of byrons works 
found one last poem just five minutes away from his office in a 
university of virginia library 
as he was putting the finishing touches on the final book of his 
collection of the english romantic poets works he learned of an 
early 19thcentury american edition of george gordon byrons poems 
this particular edition has not been noticed before it was 
published without the authors permission said professor jerome 
mcgann 
the volume contains a poem that mcgann said has never been 
included in an authorized byron collection 
mcgann said the fourline verse on the regency is one of 
80 to 90 new poems in the complete poetical works of lord 
byron 
some of these have never been known to exist others have been 
printed but only in obscure books mcgann said this is the 
first complete byron collection since the turn of the century and 
the first to contain these poems 
mcgann said he began work on the byron collection in 1970 he 
had not known of the existence of the poem he found last week until 
a colleague asked him recently if he thought the poem was 
authentic mcgann said 
the scholar said every piece included in the compilation was 
painstakingly authenticated 
byron wrote from 1806 to 1824 and is remembered for such poems 
as don juan and childe harold 
he fell out of favor for much of the 20th century because his 
work ran against the grain of the centurys cherished ideas about 
poetry mcgann said now however critics look at bryon 
differently if there is any traditional british writer who would 
be seen as being postmodern it would surely be byron 
oxford university press will publish mcganns sevenvolume set 
in the fall

the state department fbi and armed services 
hampered the central intelligence agency in its infancy by 
bickering about authority over covert activities and other 
operations according to a longsecret cia history of the spy 
agencys early years 
the 1000page narrative written in 1953 by historian arthur b 
darling is the first cia document to be declassified and 
transferred to the national archives for release to the public 
under the spy agencys historical review program 
a copy of it was delivered to president bush on wednesday by 
william webster director of the cia and don w wilson archivist 
of the united states 
webster said other cia records will be declassified and 
transferred to the archives 
the declassified version of darlings history is accompanied by 
a note from the cias history staff cautioning readers that the 
former yale history professor who was the agencys first 
historian had a definite and sometimes controversial point of 
view 
darling blames the state department the fbi and what he 
terms the military establishment especially the heads of the 
military intelligence services for much of the hardship which the 
early cia and its predecessor the central intelligence group 
endured the note says 
the history staff also said that the late allen dulles when he 
became director of central intelligence in 1953 reportedly 
did not concur with darlings conclusions and restricted access 
to the history 
darling was the agencys historian from 1952 to 1954 he died in 
1971 
he wrote that sniping by the military departments began as soon 
as the office of strategic services forerunner of the cia was 
established by president franklin d roosevelt during world war ii 
brig gen john magruder deputy director of the oss told 
darling that career military officers lowered their horns 
against the expert economists geographers historians and 
scientists recruited for the new spying network 
darling conceded in his history that the military might have 
been justified in withholding information because the oss 
deserved part of its reputation for being a sieve 
he quoted oss chief william j wild bill donovan however 
as saying it was the military men who were the leaky boys 
in any event darling wrote they are reluctant to this moment 
in 1953 to give a central civilian agency intelligence which 
exposes their capabilities in war 
the result has been interference with the flow of raw 
materials essential to the realistic estimates which should go to 
the makers of diplomatic policy and military strategy he said 
the army navy and the department of state were always glad to 
use the research and analysis branch of the office of strategic 
services as a servant he wrote they were not willing to 
accept it as an equal partner in final judgments 
as the war approached an end donovan proposed to the president 
on nov 18 1944 that the oss be turned into a permanent central 
intelligence system 
but this was not to happen darling wrote the federal 
bureau of investigation and the armed services accepted the 
invitation to combat vociferously and at length the department 
of state proceeded with its own plan aided and encouraged by the 
bureau of the budget and the department of justice 
donovans plan was leaked to the press and led to editorials 
denouncing it as a superspy system and a police state and 
complaints in congress that the government envisioned creating a 
supergestapo 
president truman disbanded the oss on sept 20 1945 and ordered 
the state department to take the lead in developing a postwar 
intelligence network in doing so wrote darling he turned aside a 
justice department plan to make the fbi the center of the national 
intelligence system 
on jan 24 1946 he issued a directive creating the central 
intelligence group it was prohibited from interfering with 
internal security functions 
succeeding directors of central intelligence were to have a 
merry time with j edgar hoover of the fbi darling wrote 
hoover even maintained that the fbi needed posts abroad at 
least in the western hemisphere to protect internal security he 
agreed to withdraw his agents from latin america but was irate 
at being required to do so darling said 
the central intelligence group became the central intelligence 
agency in 1947 as part of the same law that merged the war and navy 
departments into the new department of defense 
the subject of covert activities which would become the most 
controversial part of the cias operations arose later that year 
when the national security council issued a secret directive 
assigning the cia the task of undercover psychological warfare 
against the soviet union and its satellites 
sabotage and physical subversion had been high on donovans 
agenda in wartime but adm roscoe h hillenkoeter the first cia 
director was reluctant to take them on and argued that congress 
would have to be informed beforehand and its approval obtained 
the nsc overruled hillenkoeter saying congress had already 
given the agency power to perform such other functions and duties 
related to intelligence activities affecting the national security 
as the national security council may from time to time direct 
the decision would lead to repeated clashes between congress and 
succeeding administrations as lawmakers complained of cia covert 
actions in central america and elsewhere 
darling wrote that hillenkoeter although not pleased with 
the decision did not object to the assignment 
however said the historian neither the armed services nor 
the state department intended him to have a free hand they were 
determined that there should be some guidance other than broad 
policy determined by the national security council and began 
negotiations to obtain another directive 
the dispute was settled by another secret order making the 
director of central intelligence responsible for ensuring through 
designated representatives of the secretary of state and of the 
secretary of defense that covert operations were consistent with 
foreign and military policy 
hillenkoetter felt that the state department and the military 
establishment in their struggle for power wanted the office in 
the central intelligence agency because neither wanted the other to 
have it darling wrote if it failed they could disown it 
meanwhile both wished to control it

now he is helping plan a national science foundation conference 
for computer scientists and philosophers to discuss ethical 
questions posed by the explosive growth of computer technology 
according to covey and other experts increased concern over the 
security of their own computer files has helped spur university 
faculty members and students across the country to pay more serious 
attention to issues of computer ethics 
this has resulted in more campus lectures symposiums workshops 
and entire courses devoted to ethical and social implications of 
computing 
key ethical questions include privacy of computerstored 
information effects of computerization on the distribution of 
power in society liability for malfunctions in computer programs 
and the creation of malicious software such as computer viruses 
joseph turner chairman of the computer science accreditation 
commission estimates that half the 80 colleges and universities 
with computer science programs accredited by his organization offer 
computer ethics courses up from about 10 percent five years ago 
its very definitely on the increase said turner chairman 
of the computer science department at south carolinas clemson 
university 
the risks of computer abuse were dramatized in november 1988 
when a cornell university graduate student unleashed a computer 
worm into the internet electronic network about 6000 
computers connected to the network were paralyzed 
the worms creator robert tappan morris 24 of arnold md 
has been indicted under the federal computer fraud and abuse act 
and is to go on trial nov 29 in syracuse ny 
at the urging of a university panel that investigated the morris 
case cornells computing board this fall adopted a statement of 
principles for faculty staff and students 
the use of computers and network systems in no way exempts you 
from the normal requirements of ethical behavior in the cornell 
university community the statement says it calls on all 
computer users to respect the privacy of other users data the 
ownership of proprietary software and the procedures established to 
manage computer systems 
buck bloombecker director of the national center for computer 
crime data a nonprofit research institute based in los angeles 
said that recently ive seen a lot more talking about the need 
for ethics some of the people who are doing the talking are 
taking action 
part of the reason he said is that more faculty members and 
students are being victimized by computer crime because of things 
like viruses and that makes the topic less academic and more 
gripping to them 
but despite such increased attention to computer ethics 
bloombecker said its still just a drop in the bucket 
one of the hard facts that we have to confront is that a lot 
of people think that science and business work a lot better if you 
dont hamper them with ethics he said 
a group of academic specialists met nov 1 in suburban 
arlington va to draft plans for an august 1991 computer ethics 
conference expected to involve 300 to 500 computer professionals 
philosophers social scientists public policymakers and business 
people 
planning for the conference is being carried out under a grant 
from the ethics and values studies program of the national science 
foundation a federal agency that distributes research grants 
the head of the planning group terrell w bynum director of 
the research center on computing and society at southern 
connecticut state university in new haven said the gathering would 
mark the first international congress for integrating human 
values into computing 
deborah g johnson a philosopher at rensselaer polytechnic 
institute in troy ny said the amount of substantive 
communication going on now between computer professionals and 
philosophers is still fairly limited 
theres no incentive for computer scientists to worry about 
this she said they dont get any credit for being worried 
about the social impacts theyre supposed to publish technical 
papers and philosophers have the same emphasis theyre not 
supposed to dirty their hands by dealing in the real world theyre 
supposed to publish abstract theoretical papers that have nothing 
to do with anything real 
ms johnson said a textbook she wrote on computer ethics is 
being used this academic year at 93 colleges and universities 
approximately double the number of schools which utilized it last 
year 
institutions that offer courses dealing with computer ethics and 
the social implications of computing include carnegie mellon 
clemson southern connecticut state rensselaer polytechnic the 
massachusetts institute of technology cambridge mass stanford 
university palo alto calif the university of california 
campuses at berkeley and irvine northeastern university boston 
and the university of washington seattle 
at carnegie mellon covey said a major question facing the 
computing profession is how do you bring about the kind of 
institutionalized awareness that you see today in medical ethics 
if you look back 20 years when that area was really in a very 
formative stage philosophers and medical professionals were very 
wary of each other its come a long way since then he said 
covey chairman of the american philosophical associations 
committee on computer use in philosophy said that up to now he 
believes there has been real timidity about bringing the hammer 
of justice down on hackers who abuse the system 
i think that when damage is caused in terms of personhours 
lost property lost work lost it ought to be treated just like 
the case of arson or breaking and entering where there are actual 
and measurable harms he said its perfectly analogous to if 
somebody broke into your office and destroyed or stole paper 
files

govelect l douglas wilder has taken 
descriptions of his razorthin victory margin at face value 
shaving off his mustache while he waits for official vote totals to 
be released monday 
the democrat vying to become the nations first elected black 
governor went ahead and fulfilled a promise to a reporter that he 
would shave off the mustache if he beat republican j marshall 
coleman 
the lieutenant governor first appeared in public last week 
without the mustache he has worn since his state senate days in the 
1970s prompting a flurry of inquiries 
its amazing how much attention it has garnered said laura 
dillard wilders press secretary but hey id rather talk about 
that than some other subjects 
on monday the state board of elections will certify the results 
of the balloting for which unofficial tallies showed wilder 
defeating coleman by fewer than 6800 votes at 897025 for wilder 
and 890273 for coleman 
state certification is made after all cities and counties have 
checked their nov 7 election results and reported the figures to 
the board which also checks the results against registered voter 
lists 
coleman a former state attorney general has said he may seek a 
recount if the official margin is less than a halfpercent of the 
178 million ballots cast or about 9000 votes he has 10 days 
from the certification to make the recount request 
if the unofficial count is correct were well within that 
margin said mike salster a spokesman for the state republican 
party 
were proceeding with the assumption that a recount will be 
called for salster said 
it was the closest race for governor in state history and there 
is no precedent for a statewide recount said susan fitzhugh 
secretary of the board of elections 
mrs fitzhugh has declined to estimate the length of time or 
cost of a recount which would be overseen by a panel of three 
judges 
wilder has steered clear of comments on whether coleman should 
accept the certified vote or would be justified in seeking a 
recount 
weve said all along the ball is in the losers court ms 
dillard said 
wilder has appointed a transition team director and taken other 
steps toward preparing to become virginias third straight 
democratic governor on jan 13 
he also has dismissed suggestions that his victory showed racism 
among voters 
preelection and exit polls showed wilder winning by as much as 
10 percent his running mates donald s beyer jr for lieutenant 
governor and mary sue terry for reelection as attorney general 
won by comfortable margins of 54 percent and 63 percent 
respectively 
wilder a former state senator from richmond was elected 
lieutenant governor in 1985 with almost 52 percent of the vote

the number of parolees from state and federal 
prison sentences went up 125 percent in 1988 to post the largest 
increase of the decade according to a recent justice department 
study 
the figures also show a significant increase 87 percent in 
the number of people who were on parole last year from federal 
prison sentences 
the 87 percent increase capped a fiveyear period during which 
the number of federal parolees went from 16325 to 20487 
overall the number of adults on parole from state and federal 
prison sentences increased from 362748 at the start of 1988 to 
407977 at years end according to the study by the departments 
bureau of justice statistics 
the increase in the overall number of parolees in 1988 was the 
largest since 1983 when there was a 1206 percent hike from 224604 
to 251708 parolees according to previous reports issued by the 
department 
there was a net increase last year from 18846 to 20484 federal 
parolees the study said there were 13288 new parolees in 1988 
while 11647 ended terms of parole supervision 
last years 87 percent increase in federal parolees was sharply 
higher than the 62 percent hike in 1987 there were also annual 
increases from 1984 through 1986 ranging from 15 percent to 55 
percent 
the fiveyear period of increases followed three successive 
annual declines the number of federal parolees dropped 97 percent 
in 1981 94 percent in 1982 and 75 percent in 1983 
benjamin f baer chairman of the us parole commission said 
last years increase is a result of a sharp increase in the number 
of federal inmates in the last decade as the prison population 
goes up the number of people on parole supervision goes up 
he noted that in 1984 there were some 30000 federal prisoners 
on nov 16 there were 52741 federal prisoners the latest 
count taken by the bureau of prisons the overcrowded federal 
prison system has an inmate population that is 65 percent higher 
than it was built to hold 
baer denied that overcrowding is a factor in determining whether 
federal prisoners are granted parole parole decisions are made 
according to guidelines that take into account the prisoners 
behavior and his attitude toward his crime baer said 
some states however use parole as a way to relieve 
overcrowding 
alabama where a 36 percent increase in paroles was the largest 
among states last year paroles prisoners convicted of property 
crimes to make room for violent offenders said don drasheff a 
spokesman for the state board of pardons and paroles 
enough inmates were paroled this year to save populating two 
major prisons he said 
north carolina which posted a 333 percent increase in paroles 
last year has a law that limits the number of inmates that can be 
held in state prisons to 17640 
a prison emergency that recently ended was declared in september 
after the inmate population stayed above the ceiling for 15 
straight days 
so many lowrisk inmates were paroled during the 58day 
emergency that state prison spokesman david guth said he doubted 
weve left anybody for the governor to commute at christmas

a state senate race that started out hohum has 
thrust one of the candidates into the national spotlight since a 
bishop banned her from taking communion because of her prochoice 
stance on abortion 
the roman catholic bishop said candidate lucy killeas public 
position is a blatant affront to the church 
killea has been besieged by interview requests from all over the 
country and has made two national television appearances while 
abortion rights advocates rally around her 
newspaper polls also show an overwhelming majority of catholics 
and noncatholics in san diego county object to bishop leo t 
mahers sanction the first of its kind in the nation against an 
elected official and which many see as an unacceptable intrusion of 
religion into politics 
killea a democrat and fourterm assemblywoman from san diego 
is on the dec 5 special election ballot for a seat vacated by a 
resignation her republican opponent is fellow assemblywoman carol 
bentley of el cajon 
most political leaders agree the bishops order significantly 
enhances killeas prospects of winning in a district where 49 
percent of registered voters are republican compared to 38 percent 
democrats 
however bentley believes her partisan advantage will offset any 
adverse impact the controversy has on her campaign 
this is still a republican district and im the republican 
candidate but the bishop certainly did take the campaign out 
of our hands she said 
bentley believes the winner will be the candidate whose 
supporters are more motivated to go to the polls thats why she 
declined a request to appear with killea on the phil donahue show 
nov 20 believing her time was better spent campaigning 
personally i dont care about my nationwide name id i care 
about what it is in the 39th district she said 
killea says interviews and national television appearances have 
cut into campaign time but shes doing them because of the effect 
the communion ban might have on other catholic elected officials 
and potential politicians 
she said shes afraid the bishops order will prevent younger 
people from getting involved in politics when they otherwise might 
consider it 
mahers order barring killea from participating in communion in 
the roman catholic church was issued one day after her campaign 
began running television ads outlining the difference between her 
stand on abortion and bentleys 
the ads talk about antiabortion advocates dedicated to 
turning back the clock on womens rights and say theres a 
danger that californians once again may see painful scary 
backalley abortions if those people get their way 
bentley a presbyterian believes abortions should be permitted 
only in cases of rape incest or severe health complications for 
the mother she has kept her distance in the killeamaher rift 
calling it something between lucy and her church 
maher head of the san diego diocese notified killea of the 
sanction in a letter that said her advertisements and prochoice 
comments during the campaign are in complete contradiction to the 
moral teachings of the catholic church 
a poll of san diego county residents found 69 percent of 
catholics and 70 percent of noncatholics disagreed with mahers 
order among catholics 72 percent of 405 people surveyed randomly 
also said they disagree with the catholic churchs stance on 
abortion 
the bishop denied any attempt to influence the race 
if she hadnt run those ads probably nothing would have been 
done but those ads are flagrantly contrary to the moral law of the 
catholic church and i think she brought this on herself maher 
said

spending for the future in the third world is 
rising again especially on such things as equipment that creates 
new jobs according to figures assembled from 30 countries 
on the other hand spending is not generally up on schools to 
train potential workers 
much private investment in the third world has come from the 
united states and other industrial countries during most of the 
1980s all investment public and private had gone down in poor 
countries 
the newer trend was spotted by guy p pfeffermann of france for 
the international finance corporation a part of the world bank 
that lends directly to businesses instead of going through 
governments 
though percentage rises are small they amount to many billions 
of dollars when figured against total production the total 
production of argentina for example was about 73 billion in 
1986 when that rose by only 08 percent in 1987 it meant an 
increase of nearly 600 million 
private investment seems to have begun to recover somewhat 
after reaching its low point about 198586 pfeffermann wrote in 
a newlypublished discussion paper 
recommending that private investors take advantage of the trend 
he pointed out a sharp variation in regions private investment in 
recent years has amounted to 15 percent of production in east asia 
9 percent in latin america 8 percent in south asia and 6 percent 
in africa 
his figures show that private investment rose steadily through 
most of the 1970s he dated a decline which may now be reversed 
from the second oil shock of 1979 that was when the revolution 
in iran sent the price of oil up again the first oil shock came in 
1973 when arab oil producers raised prices as part of their 
conflict with israel it apparently did not have as much effect 
public investment includes spending by governments on schools 
medical care roads harbors and other projects needed to make a 
country viable in the third world it also includes considerable 
money for new installations and equipment since business people 
there are less likely to make that kind of investment 
some governments in poor countries have also considered 
themselves socialist they have seen a larger place for themselves 
in business than has been the case with most governments of 
industrial countries especially in the era of such champions of 
private enterprise as ronald reagan and margaret thatcher 
third world public investment began falling in 1983 according 
to pfeffermanns figures it peaked in 1982 at 106 percent of the 
30 countries total production 
it was the beginning of the third world debt crisis 
pfeffermann said in an interview after that governments found 
themselves having to pay out so much on their foreign debt that 
they cut back other spending 
by 1988 the proportion of public investment to production was 
down to 72 percent 
pfeffermanns results were borne out by a survey of africa 
released tuesday by the world bank for example the bank showed 
the government of nigeria the most populous country in africa 
spending 45 percent of its budget on education in 1980 and only 
28 percent in 1987 health expenditures were 25 percent in 1980 
and 07 percent in 1987 housing amenities social security and 
welfare treated by the bank as a single item were down to 15 
percent from 66 percent 
pfeffermann found public investment in nigeria back up to 88 
percent of production in 1988 almost twice the 43 percent of 1984 
but still well below the 154 percent of 1981 
private investment in the 30 countries dropped from 238 percent 
of production in 1980 to 185 percent in 1985 but three years 
later it had crept back up to 189 percent the countries showing a 
rise in private investment since 1983 or 1984 were argentina 
bolivia brazil chile colombia costa rica ecuador guatemala 
hungary india indonesia kenya mexico nigeria peru portugal 
thailand turkey and uruguay 
private investment fell in relation to total production only in 
bangladesh malaysia the philippines and tunisia 
it held steady in pakistan singapore zimbabwe and zambia

in an electoral version of the mouse 
that roared vote fraud in a rural backwater is threatening the 
dynasty that has dominated the worlds biggest democracy since 
independence in 1947 
the shenanigans in amethi the parliamentary district of prime 
minister rajiv gandhi also have highlighted political problems in 
india where criminals unite with politicians distributing slush 
funds and rigging votes 
but the decision to call a revote in the 1320squaremile 
dusty mix of rural poverty and boomtown also has given some cause 
for hope 
the election commission which is supposed to be an independent 
watchdog agency reportedly was pressured by gandhis governing 
congress party to reject calls for a revote in the district 350 
miles southeast of new delhi 
trouble began in amethi on wednesday the first day of voting in 
the national parliamentary election 
an influential opposition leader sanjay singh was shot in the 
stomach in a clash with congress party workers 
gandhis opponent for the parliament seat raj mohan gandhi 
alleged that police roughed him up when he went to a polling booth 
to check reports of fraud raj mohan gandhi who is unrelated to 
the prime minister is the grandson of mohandas k gandhi indias 
beloved independence leader 
the opposition demanded a repoll and the election commission 
sent a fourman team to amethi to investigate the decision came 
early sunday after a marathon meeting revoting was ordered for 98 
booths in the district on monday each precinct has about 1000 
voters 
the commission also sacked two top police officers who had 
supervised the vote 
the decision dealt a stunning blow to the prestige of gandhi 
the 45yearold former airline pilot who became prime minister on a 
wave of sympathy following the oct 31 1984 assassination of his 
mother prime minister indira gandhi 
voting fraud is a common feature in indian politics but never 
had repolling been ordered in the prime ministers own backyard 
gandhis position already had been weakened by criticism of his 
leadership and reports of highlevel corruption in his government 
stemming from a 14 billion weapons deal 
in addition the prime ministers congress party which has 
ruled india for all but 29 months since independence from british 
rule is facing the most cohesive challenge ever from a fiveparty 
opposition coalition the national front 
but even if congress wins a majority in parliament many say 
gandhis position as prime minister is in doubt 
no one wants a prime minister who cant even control his own 
constituency said bhabani sen gupta a noted political 
commentator

southern california and his success is measured in millions of 
dollars but dandy vom sargau is retiring in january at the peak of 
his career 
during his six years of sniffing out drugs for the suburb of 
monrovia the 9yearold german shepherd has been on more than 400 
cases and helped seize more than 1 billion worth of illicit drugs 
said his handler monrovia police officer rick miglia 
he thinks its fun miglia said 
i dont think hes ever made a mistake said jake jahelka of 
canine k9 scents inc the academy that trained dandy 
dandy even had a hand er nose in the nations largest 
cocaine bust 
after getting a sniff of a cardboard box found outside a los 
angeles warehouse he went into a snarling frenzy 
his alert on that box was a part of the overall probable cause 
that led to the search warrant said drug enforcement 
administration spokesman ralph lochridge 
officers serving the warrant on the warehouse found 21 tons of 
cocaine six people were arrested and 122 million in cash was 
seized 
dandys reputation has spread so far that monrovia has lent him 
to the los angeles police department los angeles county sheriffs 
department fbi california highway patrol the secret service and 
the postal service 
the job has had its drawbacks police keep dandy celibate and on 
a dryfood diet so the odors of meat and female dogs wont distract 
him while hes working 
life should be easier in retirement when miglia will keep his 
old partner at home

beijings communist party has barred private 
entrepreneurs from joining its ranks in the latest move to purge 
those working outside the statecontrolled system 
the beijing daily reported that municipal party officials in a 
threeday meeting ending saturday decided that private businessmen 
and those who earn livings by using the labor of others will not be 
allowed to become party members 
the new regulation proposed by organization department chief 
chen guangwen also states that private entrepreneurs who are 
already party members must strictly observe party line and thought 
they must use their profits for public benefit carry out tasks 
assigned them by the party and pay party fees in accordance with 
their real incomes 
the saturday report did not say how many private entrepreneurs 
belonged to the party but their numbers are believed to be 
negligible 
the communist party nationwide has 48 million members less than 
5 percent of the population most members are workers farmers and 
bureaucrats 
the nations 12 million private entrepreneurs mostly running 
small free market clothing and food stalls have generally stayed 
out of politics 
the party directive however shows the declining status of 
private businesses before the june military crackdown on 
prodemocracy dissent they were hailed for providing needed 
services and employment and giving competition to inefficient 
staterun firms 
the government now says private enterprise can continue to play 
a peripheral economic role but tighter surveillance has driven 
several million private entrepreneurs out of business

an early adjournment by congress this year is 
giving the keating 5 senators who intervened with federal 
regulators on behalf of the nowfailed lincoln savings and loan 
association a brief respite from the spotlight of formal 
investigations 
but even in the absence of public hearings investigations 
continue by two committees of congress and several federal agencies 
into how the california thrift owned by phoenix millionaire charles 
h keating jr became possibly the biggest case of bank fraud in 
history 
and there is no shortage of opportunities for the major players 
in the unfolding drama to make voluntary appearances 
two of the five accepted invitations to reiterate their defenses 
on television sunday appearing along with one of their chief 
accusers and the embattled federal regulator who is under growing 
pressure to resign because of his role in dealing with the collapse 
of lincoln and scores of other sampls 
these are just the initial stage of an ongoing progress 
house banking committee chairman henry b gonzalez said at the 
conclusion last week of six hearings into why taxpayers are going 
to have to pay up to 25 billion to depositors who trusted their 
savings to keating and his associates 
according to regulators that money in the form of sampl 
deposits insured by the federal government was lost to an 
elaborate pyramid scheme of phoney real estate and other deals 
perpetrated by keating 
rep jim leach riowa put the cost of the lincoln bailout 
alone at 50 out of the pockets of every american family 
named during 50 hours of testimony as accomplices in the scheme 
knowing or unknowing were five us senators the nations top 
thrift regulators former president reagans chief of staff one of 
the nations most prestigious accounting firms and federal reserve 
board chairman alan greenspan 
everybody that had a position of trust and responsibility has 
a tremendous accounting to make to the american people still 
said gonazalez a populist texas democrat who has taken a 
letthechipsfallwheretheymay approach into his investigation 
of what went wrong 
m danny wall the chief sampl regulator said sunday he has no 
intention at this point of resigning as head of the treasury 
departments office of thrift supervision president bush two weeks 
ago said he had not ruled out replacing wall 
wall acknowledged on abcs this week with david brinkley 
that we have in the final analysis made some mistakes but 
added that as the investigation proceeds time will indeed be 
kind to us 
keating and a thenmanaging partner of the big eight 
accounting firm of arthur young amp co now ernst amp young that 
served as lincolns auditor have declined to give a public 
accounting 
of more than two dozen witnesses subpoenaed for the house 
hearings they were the only two to claim a fifth amendment 
constitutional right to not testify on the grounds that what they 
might say under oath could incriminate them 
the five senators who received or solicited a total of 13 
million in campaign and other political funds from keating have 
avoided testifying so far 
gonzalez and house speaker thomas s foley dwash said at the 
opening of the hearings in october that it would be futile for the 
house committee to subpoena the senators both cited precedents of 
similar attempts in which senators simply refused to honor a 
subpoena 
and none of the five sens alan cranston dcalif donald w 
riegle jr dmich john glenn dohio dennis deconcini dariz 
and john mccain rariz volunteered to subject themselves to a 
grilling from their colleagues sitting on the other side of the 
capitol dome 
all have acknowledged meeting with regulators from the federal 
home loan bank board in early 1987 on behalf of keating their 
friend and contributor as described by thenbank board chairman 
edwin j gray one of the meeting participants 
gray reiterated on the brinkley show sunday that the lawmakers 
improperly pressured him as a favor to keating they were asking 
me to withdraw a regulation for their friend gray said i 
said were not going to do that 
glenn responded by repeating his strong contention that he did 
nothing improper 
any implication that i have done something wrong in this case 
is just flat wrong and i resent it with every fiber in my being 
glenn said on the brinkley show 
mccain appearing on the same show likewise reiterated his 
slightly less strident stance that it was a serious mistake on my 
part to have not immediately made reimbursements for trips taken 
on keatings corporate plane but that inquiries eventually will 
clear him of any rule breaking 
i did nothing that i wouldnt do for any major employer or 
economic factor in my state mccain said 
brinkley said cranston riegle and deconcini declined 
invitations to appear on his show 
at the time of the meetings on behalf of keating regulators had 
been watching lincoln evolve from a typical home mortgage lender 
into the epitome of the highflyer sampls that prompted the need 
for a 150 billionplus taxpayer bailout of the industry this year 
all five senators have said they violated no law nor rule of the 
senate nonetheless the senate ethics committee two weeks ago 
appointed an outside counsel to investigate charges that their 
intervention constituted a conflict of interest 
the senates rules on such conflicts say that a senator cannot 
permit any compensation to accrue to his beneficial interest from 
any source by virtue of influence improperly exerted from his 
position as a member 
to one degree or another all five senators claim the influence 
they exerted was not improper all maintain they have and will 
continue to do the same thing for any constituent regardless of 
whether the constituent has contributed money to their political 
causes 
meanwhile senate majority leader george mitchell wants to use 
the lincoln controversy to reignite a longstalled effort for 
socalled campaign finance reform in which public tax dollars would 
replace private contributions in financing political candidates 
election pitches to the voting public 
can an elected official receive something from another person 
anything of value and retain his or her independence of 
judgment mitchell asked thats the issue thats raised by all

doctors social workers and therapists are giving 
a new name to a syndrome they say is draining their ranks 
compassion fatigue 
it strikes people who take on too heavy a load of other peoples 
burdens leaving little time or energy for themselves victims 
become disillusioned and depressed and often start to show cracks 
in their professional veneer 
everyone that i work with is affected by it ive felt it in 
myself said social worker lydia parsons of the midmaine medical 
center in waterville ive had other people tell me about it 
about me before i was aware of it 
compassion fatigue is gaining recognition a halfdozen 
presentations were devoted to it at a recent national associations 
of social workers conference dr edward poliandro of mount sinai 
medical school in new york said people were hanging from the 
rafters to hear his workshop on stress management 
some hospitals are offering support programs that feature stress 
management classes longer staff meetings and even daily walks 
through the park 
as many as 20 percent of caregiving professionals suffer such 
burnout said dr lyle h miller head of the biobehavioral 
institute in boston 
typical victims sound almost like tv stereotypes of social 
workers or doctors working too much sleeping too little 
sacrificing their own lives and families for case after case 
its the best and the brightest and the most committed and the 
most energetic that burn out miller said 
parsons is a classic example as director of the social work 
department at the redingtonfairview hospital in skowhegan maine 
she was running on empty so often she couldnt do anything very 
well i always felt guilty even going for lunch because there 
was always someone waiting for me 
parsons quit that job and after a break in which she worked 
parttime joined midmaine where there are frequent staff 
meetings and peer support 
thomas a welch a former catholic priest who left a bostonarea 
hospice program after a decade of helping the terminally ill deal 
with the prospect of death said he had been happy with his work 
but that it was too consuming to stay good at it for long 
its very heavy emotional material its not something that 
anyone should do for a very long time said welch who left both 
the church and the hospice in 1985 and now owns an italian 
restaurant you get a sense that the whole world is dying after a 
while i heard a friend say i was a downer i should find a way to 
lighten up 
compassion fatigue went unrecognized for a long time because of 
the stigma attached to it experts say 
very often people in any line of field would be looked down 
upon if they were to acknowledge they were really stressed out 
said poliandro who teaches stress management at the mount sinai 
medical school 
theres a double standard of being in the helping profession 
that we should be able to see it in ourselves before anxiety 
becomes a crisis said parsons 
when perfect employees ignore their stress they can become an 
administrators nightmare miller said they can develop headaches 
backaches fatigue depression and irritability they might start 
to abuse drugs and alcohol or begin not showing up for work 
poliandro said 
the best way to fight compassion fatigue 
take a vacation poliandro and miller agreed 
administrators can help however the boss can force workers to 
take lunches away from their desk outlaw working past 9 pm or 
forbid employees to work weekends poliandro said 
at mount sinai personnel can enlist in the wellness 
program which offers among other activities daily walks through 
nearby central park its a rapid walk to build up their health 
but also they do it just to enjoy being outside and away from the 
pressures of the office poliandro said 
ultimately professionals who help people have to teach 
themselves how to stave off the needs of their own patients said 
miller and poliandro 
humans have a tremendous capacity to be resilient said 
poliandro they just have to be able replenish their energy

a homeland leader who has 
embraced the antiapartheid movement won the support of the african 
national congress on sunday during an emotional rally attended by 
50000 people 
the rally represented the strongest show of support for a 
homeland ruler by antiapartheid leaders the activists have long 
considered the leaders of the 10 black homelands part of the 
apartheid system and collaborators with the whiteled south african 
government 
the anc leaders told the roaring crowd that they supported the 
reforms being adopted by gen bantu holomisa leader of the 
transkei homeland and called him a spiritual member of their 
guerrilla movement 
walter sisulu joined by six anc colleagues said the military 
ruler has fully integrated transkei into the national struggle 
against apartheid 
we call on people in all homelands to follow your example 
sisulu told the cheering crowd at a sports stadium in umtata 
transkeis capital 
it was an unprecedented show of support for a homeland ruler by 
leaders of the antiapartheid movement none of the homelands is 
recognized by the anc or abroad but four including transkei have 
nominal independence 
holomisa 34 clearly has earned the respect of the 
antiapartheid movement since coming to power two years ago in a 
coup 
he says the outlawed anc is a key player in any political 
settlement in south africa and that he may legalize the group in 
transkei the birthplace of many anc leaders including sisulu and 
the imprisoned nelson mandela 
holomisa recently lifted the state of emergency freed political 
prisoners and lifted bans on 15 antiapartheid groups in the 
homeland which has 4 million residents scattered along south 
africas southeastern coast 
the ancs army is alive and well in the transkei alongside the 
army of gen holomisa and it is my personal belief that holomisa 
is a spiritual member of umkhonto we sizwe the ancs armed 
wing said anc leader andrew mlangeni 
sisulu and mlangeni are among six anc leaders who were released 
last month after more than 25 years in prison five were present in 
umtata along with oscar mpetha 80 freed last month after five 
years in jail and govan mbeki 79 released two years ago after 23 
years in prison 
the anc leaders shared the stage with holomisa and huge flags of 
the anc and its outlawed ally the south african communist party 
many in the crowd wore anc tshirts and sang in support of the 
organization which wages a bombing and sabotage campaign against 
the south african government the rally was broadcast throughout 
transkei on the homelandrun radio station 
before the rally holomisa issued an apology for an incident 
saturday in which the anc leaders were teargassed in an umtata 
church as they prepared to speak in the ensuing melee two members 
of the 400strong audience were killed by gunfire the anc leaders 
escaped injury 
we shoulder the blame for this incident entirely said 
holomisa it would appear that some of these renegade policemen 
ignored policy and fired tear gas into a peaceful gathering 
in other developments sunday 
mandelas wife winnie gave her first public speech since the 
antiapartheid movement expelled her in february and accused her 
bodyguards of waging a reign of terror mrs mandela recently 
has been appearing with antiapartheid leaders though no formal 
reconciliation has been announced 
in a brief speech in kwathema east of johannesburg she told 
10000 blacks that her husband is more concerned about achieving 
democracy in south africa than the timetable for his release 
the government is expected to free mandela within months he is 
serving a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the 
government 
in the black homeland of kwazulu 25000 people marched to a 
police station in kwamashu and submitted a statement accusing 
police of brutality and a general disregard for law and order

civic forum is ready to create a bridge for a peaceful path from 
totalitarianism to civil freedom which will later be guaranteed by

premier ladislav adamec 
i would like to thank the organizers of this rally for inviting 
me i will gladly explain my ideas and i will listen to the 
demands of any representatives of the public who are interested in 
finding joint solutions of the problems that exist that is why i 
came here to join you 
in only a few hours the general strike will begin there is some 
concern about what will happen and what the strike will bring that 
is why i proposed to look for an approach that will keep to a 
minimum the damage it brings to the national economy 
i am glad that all participants in the negotiations agree that 
it should have a symbolic character to state your views it is not 
necessary to strike for two hours two minutes would do 
we must look for unity without suspicion we must try to 
understand each other that is why the government is prepared to 
negotiate with everybody caring for the good of our country 
throughout the country there is agreement in principle of the need 
to speed up the reforms therefore it is necessary to limit the 
social tension as soon as possible to end strikes and 
demonstrations 
the enforcement of political demands must be in full agreement 
with the efforts to improve the economic situation this is what i 
regard under the present conditions as the principal question

swiss voters on sunday rejected a draft law that 
would have abolished the countrys army by the year 2000 but the 
law won more support than expected 
defense minister kaspar villiger said he would set up a panel to 
analyze criticisms voiced about the 625000strong army 
the switzerland has no army constitutional amendment was 
favored by 356 percent or 1052218 of those who cast ballots 
opposed were 644 percent or 1903797 
polls had predicted the proposal would win a maximum 30 percent 
support 
voter turnout was 69 percent the highest for a referendum since 
the 1971 measure that gave women the right to vote 
the government urged people to oppose the law arguing that 
swiss neutrality and independence could only be guaranteed by a 
credible defense force 
villiger said he did not regard the high number of votes in 
favor of the proposal as a defeat the relaxation of tension 
which happily dominates the international scene was probably one 
factor for the support he told reporters 
but supporters of the proposal were stunned by their success 
the result is unbelievable said andreas gross spokesman 
for the switzerland without an army group which collected the 
100000 signatures necessary to force the referendum 
if 500000 people can bring changes in prague then the high 
proportion of yes votes should give the swiss government food for 
thought he said referring to the prodemocracy movement in 
czechoslovakia 
the social democratic party describing the vote as 
sensational called for an examination of defense policies as 
a priority the law should be changed to allow conscientious 
objectors to perform civilian duties a statement from the party 
said 
of the four parties in switzerlands governing coalition the 
social democrats were alone in not urging rejection of the 
proposal they decided not to take a stand on the issue 
the swiss military establishment is rooted in centuriesold 
tradition even though the country has not fought in foreign wars 
since 1515 it can field more men per square mile than any other 
country in the world apart from israel 
switzerland has more artillery pieces than its much larger 
neighbor west germany and a fleet of battle tanks half that of 
france 
the defense ministry says military defense costs total about 
31 billion a year 
army opponents say costs are nearer 63 billion taking into 
account salaries in defenserelated areas and the cost to 
privatesector employers of releasing staff for the annual callup 
currently every swiss man is required to do military service 
starting with 17 weeks of basic training at age 20 followed by 13 
callups of two to three weeks until age 50 in a bid to relieve 
pressure on the countrys tight labor market the defense ministry 
this year announced reforms to end military service at the age of 
42 by 1995 
before the vote villiger acknowledged that the unpopularity of 
the compulsory basic recruit training was one of the reasons for 
the high percentage of young people expected to support the noarmy 
initiative 
in a recent survey of young recruits by a swiss magazine even 
those who said they would vote against the proposal called for 
reforms in military service many cited their dislike of blindly 
following orders 
the vote followed weeks of impassioned debate rare in normally 
reserved switzerland 
supporters of the army maintained switzerlands defense tactics 
spared the country the horrors of involvement in world war ii 
others argued switzerland stayed neutral because it curried 
hitlers favor by supplying foreign exchange and arms to the 
germans 
in a second referendum sunday voters rejected by an 
unexpectedly large majority of 62 percent a proposal to raise 
national speed limits 
the draft law aimed to raise the speed limit on highways from 
120 to 130 kilometers per hour 75 to 81 mph and on main roads 
from 80 to 100 kilometers per hour 50 to 62 mph

newly elected president elias hrawi said 
sunday he will replace christian gen michel aoun with a new army 
commander within 48 hours if aoun continues to challenge the 
fledgling government 
the warning came after parliament approved a new cabinet that 
pledged to extend its control over all lebanon including the 
christian enclave controlled by aoun 
if he aoun persists i must say with much regret that he 
will have to bear the consequences hrawi told reporters in this 
bekaa valley town wehre he has established temporary headquarters 
while aoun refuses to leave the official presidential palace 
he still is the general of the army perhaps for no more than 
48 hours after which if he stays he will become an officer of 
this army hrawi said you will know the name of the new 
commander of the army by wednesday morning 
some parliamentarians speculated hrawi would resort to military 
means if aoun was not forced out by diplomatic pressure 
hrawi a 64yearold maronite was elected friday to succeed 
president rene mouawad who was assassinated nov 22 only 17 days 
into his term 
hrawi put himself on a collision course with aoun by dismissing 
the generals military cabinet before dawn saturday and forming a 
national unity government with members from lebanons seven major 
sects 
aoun asked sunday on french television whether he would 
surrender territory controlled by his 20000 troops said no i 
will defend myself 
during the interview at his bunker in the presidential palace at 
baabda aoun speculated that mouawad was killed because he refused 
to order an attack on aouns forces 
he denied responsibility for the assassination and said he sent 
a letter to un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to 
help us discover who is the author of the killing 
parliament approved the new cabinet during a session in the park 
hotel in the syriancontrolled bekaa valley town of chtoura 23 
miles east of beirut hrawi has made temporary headquarters at the 
hotel 
all 43 deputies in attendance voted for the 14 men from all 
major sects who will try to end the 14yearold civil war 
addressing the session before the vote prime minister salim 
hoss pledged his government will seek to reestablish state 
authority law and order on all lebanons territory under an arab 
leaguebrokered peace plan endorsed by parliament in taif saudi 
arabia oct 24 
aoun rejected the accord which cleared the way for the 
presidential election because it did not guarantee a timetable for 
the withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon 
in an apparent warning to aoun hoss pledged sunday to 
mobilize all potential to remove the existing state of partition 
along with all forms of lawlessness and mutiny the government will 
not permit any adventure that threatens the nations existence 
it was not clear exactly how hrawi and hoss would go about 
removing aoun to head off final partition of the country aoun 
commands the loyalty of a cohesive army that stands as the nations 
mightiest fighting machine 
but his troops are outnumbered and outgunned by the syrians 
whose soldiers control 70 percent of lebanese territory under a 
1976 arab league mandate to quell civil war fighting 
the consensus among deputies who spoke on condition of 
anonymity was that the new government would try to remove aoun by 
political and diplomatic pressure 
if that didnt work hrawi would order a military intervention 
which syria would support they said 
druse warlord walid jumblatt now public works minister said 
sunday that aoun will not leave easily 
christian east beirut and aouns baabda palace were heavily 
shelled during six months of fierce artillery battles between 
aouns forces and the syrian army the fighting stopped with a 
sept 22 ceasefire sponsored by the arab league 
aoun in the interview with french television called the new 
government a syrian army attack on baabda the general is 
preparing for the worst 
hrawi said he was determined to rule from baabda the 
traditional seat of presidents five miles east of the capital 
whatever is left of baabda even if it is only one room when 
this situation is over in east beirut it will be my residence 
he said 
we are not here to start another war but if there is going to 
be another explosion it will only be for a few hours to finish 
those to act without legality he said 
most political analysts are convinced a military showdown is 
inevitable if hrawi seeks to evict aoun from baabda 
the taif accord provides for political reforms that give 
lebanons moslems an estimated 55 percent of the population an 
equal share of power with the traditionally dominant maronites the 
main christian sect 
the pact also outlines a phased withdrawal of syrias 40000 
troops from major cities to the bekaa within two years

after more than 40 years of communist 
rule hungarians voted freely sunday on when and how to choose the 
president of the new hungarian republic 
we wanted to take into our own hands the possibility to decide 
on the peoples future said imre loerincz a printer after 
voting 
his words were echoed by many as they emerged from polling 
stations set up in schools hospitals and municipal buildings 
after 40 years its high time people can vote freely on 
issues important to them said erzsebet nemere a pensioner from a 
workingclass district of budapest the capital 
state television said 536 percent of eligible voters in this 
country of 106 million had cast ballots by late afternoon fifty 
percent was needed for the referendum to be valid 
final results were expected sometime monday or tuesday 
election officials said many people were unfamiliar with voting 
procedures and asked how to fill out the ballots some still 
conditioned from 40 years of oneparty rule even asked what 
answers to give to the four questions on the ballot 
the main issue was whether the first president of the new 
republic should be chosen before or after free multiparty 
parliamentary elections next year the first such elections since 
the communists consolidated power in 1948 
the other three questions dealt with the ruling partys power 
whether the workers militia created to protect the communists 
should be dissolved whether the party should abolish its 
representation at the workplace and whether it should have to 
account for its assets 
since the new republic was established oct 23 in a symbolic 
rejection of communist dominance parliament speaker matyas szueros 
has been acting president the socialist party was created 
following the dissolution of the communist party 
the president commands the armed forces and can call elections 
and dissolve parliament 
parliament originally scheduled presidential elections this year 
as part of an agreement between the ruling party and several 
opposition groups 
but the league of free democrats the league of young democrats 
and two other groups demanded the elections be held next year 
claiming the ruling partys candidate imre pozsgay would have an 
advantage because he is already well known 
they said the election should be put off until after the 
parliamentary vote 
the socialists and other prominent opposition groups wanted the 
president elected by direct vote before then 
many voters said they considered all four questions very 
important but some were cynical about the referendum 
one man currently unemployed said many people he knew 
considered the referendum ridiculous and did not intend to 
vote he declined to give his name 
the referendum was marked by another first political 
campaigning on television and radio 
the four parties backing the postponed presidential election ran 
tv spots each night for about 10 days before the vote at a cost of 
5000 each for 15 seconds the spots featured famous actors and 
cultural figures 
one spot showed a chick chipping through its shell and stepping 
out into new life saying vote for the future vote yes 
the socialist party also broadcast ads 
the voting marked one of the first times voters in a soviet bloc 
country have gone to the polls in a binding nationwide referendum 
in november 1987 the thencommunist government in poland held a 
referendum seeking public support for a radical program to make the 
economy more marketoriented not enough people voted to make the 
referendum law although most of those who did cast ballots 
supported the change

a woman whose alleged rapist was 
acquitted in part because jurors implied she invited the attack by 
wearing scanty clothes may have misled authorities and 
interviewers the miami herald reported sunday 
an investigation by the herald uncovered inconsistencies in the 
womans statements and behavior during the trial suggesting that 
she lied when she denied working as a prostitute and attributed her 
income to a trust fund from her father 
the case aroused a storm of indignation when comments from the 
jurors were published after the oct 6 acquittal of steven lord 
who faces similar rape charges in georgia 
the jury foreman roy diamond said that because the woman was 
wearing a white lace miniskirt and no panties at the time of the 
incident we all felt she was asking for it 
the controversy led to demonstrations and pickets in front of 
the broward county courthouse the foreman later said the furor was 
based on a misunderstanding of his comment 
it meant sex not rape diamond said people heard it and 
they just took it for the worst he said her outfit was a 
factor in the decision but said the reason the jury did not 
believe her was her inconsistencies on the witness stand 
the 22yearold victim gave interviews under several different 
pseudonyms appearing on oprah winfrey show and larry king 
live she was also paid 3000 by the british newspaper the mail 
for her story the herald reported in its tropic magazine 
among the inconsistencies raised in the article 
on the witness stand the woman strongly denied lords 
testimony that she was a prostitute or had agreed to have sex for 
100 when lord met her in a restaurant parking lot at 3 am tropic 
found however that she had worked at three massage parlors and 
tanning salons that were raided by vice officers although she was 
never arrested 
two colleagues who spoke on condition of anonymity told the 
newspaper the woman charged for sex both in and out of the salons 
the woman explained her lack of employment by saying she had a 
trust fund from her father later claiming it had been looted by an 
attorney the attorney keith nassetta who faces similar charges 
in other cases says he never administered any trust fund for her 
the woman testified she had spent the period before the 3 am 
incident with friends but on the stand could not remember their 
last names how long she had spent with them or where they had gone 
at the trial she testified the first of several sexual 
attacks occurred off the shoulder of interstate 95 but she 
initially told detective tom white of the indian river sheriffs 
department that the first sex act occurred in a hotel parking lot 
as lord had said 
the woman at one point spent six days in jail after refusing 
to honor subpoenas to testify in the case and complained that she 
the victim was being jailed instead of lord but police said she 
gave them false names when they initially tried to serve subpoenas 
and check stubs showed she was working at a tanning salon and not 
visiting california as she said at the time the subpoenas were 
served she shouted rape when officers handcuffed her to bring 
her to jail the herald said 
the woman refused to be interviewed for the story the newspaper 
said but her attorney alexander siegel angrily denied sunday 
that his client is a prostitute 
its all innuendo siegel said theres nothing in there 
about my client because there is nothing about my client its 
character assassination done out of malice

aliens who commit serious crimes including 
murder rape and drug trafficking are a growing problem that is 
already draining law enforcement resources and threatening public 
safety officials say 
the main problem say congressional and administration 
officials is a lengthy deportation process that enables released 
convicts to commit new crimes while their immigration cases are 
pending a failure to control illegal immigration or misplaced 
priorities within the immigration and naturalization service 
the result says rep lamar smith of texas is that were 
taking about a massive problem with potentially hundreds of 
thousands of illegal aliens in the country who have committed 
crimes 
smith is ranking republican on the house judiciary subcommittee 
on immigration refugees and international law 
rep bruce morrison the subcommittee chairman says the country 
is overwhelmed with hundreds of thousands of criminal aliens 
yet the ins is only deporting a fraction of them 
the priorities there at ins do not seem to be clear at 
all said morrison dconn you really cant be allowing a 
large number of people who have committed crimes to remain in the 
country it makes a joke out of the system 
ins spokesman duke austin said the agency has increased its 
deportations of criminal aliens those either convicted or accused 
of a crime yet is bound by the law which gives most criminal 
aliens the right to a full review of their cases in immigration 
court pending deportation an alien can prolong a deportation for 
at least a year and sometimes two years 
during that time austin said aliens have been known to commit 
new crimes and end up back in prison according to austin there 
are only 60 immigration judges nationwide handling thousands of 
cases and there is only one board to consider appeals from 
decisions made by those 60 judges 
although the system may be abused in some cases an immigration 
rights activist says it protects everyones right to due process 
there are lots of people who are legally entitled to be in the 
country and who but for that process might be forcibly evicted 
said charles kamasaki vice president for research advocacy and 
legislation for national council of la raza 
there also are those aliens who with little english proficiency 
or poor legal representation are convicted of crimes yet by no 
stretch of the imagination are criminals kamasaki said 
according to smith whose san antonio district borders mexico 
aliens now account for 20 percent of the federal prison population 
if we think the 20 percent figure is high whats worse is 
that seven out of eight criminal aliens are either released or 
given probation and never serve time in prison smith said 
smith said more than 72000 aliens will be arrested every year 
on drug charges alone in texas the state spends 115000 to house 
approximately 3500 alien inmates in its prisons 
the problem of aliens who commit serious crimes like murder 
rape and drug dealing has escalated along with expanded drug 
trafficking and the number of aliens in the us smith said 
by any account the problem of criminal aliens is large and 
growing 
apprehensions of criminal aliens those referred to ins by 
local law enforcement have more than doubled in five years from 
22000 in fiscal 1985 to 51154 in 1989 
deportations of criminal aliens jumped from 4711 in 1987 to 
6072 in 1988 to 41824 in fiscal 1989 austin said 
austin said he agrees the problem of criminal aliens has been 
increasing in recent years its growing in relation to the 
illegal flow of aliens into the united states 
but kamasaki says the issue tends to be exaggerated and 
overstated in the sense that when you consider the total number 
of persons coming into the country the number of persons 
committing a crime in proportion to the 10 million aliens who 
enter annually is extraordinarily small 
kamasaki said politicians can always score quick points bashing 
criminals aliens or criminal aliens 
for a politician on the lookout for a cheap way to score some 
political points the subject even the title criminal aliens 
is like a gold mine but its really a very minor problem in the 
context of crime overall he said 
and the problem of aliens involved in the drug trade he said 
is more a drug problem than an immigration problem 
there does appear to be a large and growing problem of 
importation of drugs from certain countries but you dont solve 
that through immigration law but with regular law enforcement 
kamasaki said

a man who has searched for his 
missing daughter since february is channeling his energy and 
marketing expertise to help families of other missing people and 
keep his daughters case in the spotlight 
patrick sessions 43 a wealthy real estate developer mounted a 
nationwide search for his daughter after she disappeared near the 
university of florida in gainesville 
tiffany sessions 20 went for a walk on feb 9 near her 
apartment and told her roommate she would be back in an hour 
national newspapers picked up the story of her fathers 
dedicated hunt tabloid television covered it and sessions 
appeared on syndicated talk shows 
he has gathered what he learned from his ordeal into a 50page 
manual on how to search for a missing person the manual will be 
published early next year by the adam walsh foundation and 
sessions said the booklet will be made available to any one who 
needs it 
he said the national foundation for missing persons distributes 
a pamphlet with information about missing people but it is not as 
howto oriented as his publication 
this book really tells you what to do immediately following 
the disappearance said sessions whose search was as organized 
as a sales plan for the subdivisions his company builds he said he 
wished he had such a checklist of steps to follow when his daughter 
vanished 
the manual tells people how to work with local police what 
makes a successful flier and how to distribute such material into 
the right hands 
sessions handed out hundreds of thousands of fliers to everyone 
from mail carriers to law enforcement agencies across the country 
he has upped his reward for information about his daughter from 
75000 to 250000 and plans to mail them to police agencies and 
medical examiners every 90 days 
that way they wont forget her he said 
sessions has posted his daughters picture on billboards pizza 
boxes and in newspaper ads wayne black a private investigator who 
has been assisting in the search said sessions had come up with 
many innovative ways to search for tiffany 
he came up with the idea to give her picture to mailmen 
black said mailmen go to every house in the community 
another idea of sessions was the billboard campaign which has 
evolved into a statewide program to help track other missing 
children 
that campaign supported by corporate donations posts a photo 
of the missing person on a billboard along with a tollfree number 
each month a different missing child will be featured the 
billboards cost 7500 a month 
arvidajmb partners is sponsoring the first 100 billboards 
sessions is president of the weston division of arvida 
headquartered in boca raton fla 
but none of this has led to tiffany and black said the case has 
been the most difficult of his investigative career 
a tollfree 800 hotline rings daily in sessions office with 
reports of sightings black said every lead is followed up even 
those from psychics 
and while most callers mean well others motives are less 
honorable a gainesville man pleaded guilty nov 13 in a scheme to 
extort more than 200000 from sessions he faces up to 20 years in 
prison and 40000 in fines 
sessions saw a silver lining in the extortion incident it kepy 
tiffanys name and picture in the news 
he says hes afraid his daughter might have been a victim of a 
serial killer 
i thought when i raised the reward money to 250000 someone 
would have ratted on someone 
sessions manual is dedicated to tiffany wherever you are 
may you always remember that i love you and will keep up the 
search

a husbandwife team from minot state 
university propose turning new jersey into a giant parking lot and 
airport to alleviate crime and urban stress on the east coast 
stephen and barbara ragans idea of making new jersey into an 
international parkade is a whimsical parody of a proposal by 
two rutgers university professors in new jersey to turn the great 
plains into a giant buffalo preserve 
i think its partially serious ragan said although much of 
their 11page scholarly paper is clearly comedy it was meant 
to be fun and it has been fun i learned some things about new 
jersey its worse than i thought 
the ragans hes a professor in special education and she is an 
english department lecturer call for new jerseys 7 million 
residents to be relocated to the plains there would be five 
megaairports with rail service to nearby cities 
the buffalo idea was broached by frank popper a rutgers urban 
studies professor and his wife deborah

assault rifles have begun organized patrols in the west bank city 
of nablus to search for palestinians they suspect of collaborating 
with israel arab reporters said sunday

least twice patrolling alleys of nablus old city carrying lists 
of suspected collaborators and questioning people said the 
reporters who spoke on condition of anonymity

of the occupied lands with dense jewish settlements as a prelude to 
the israelioffered palestinian elections

shamir in the rightwing likud bloc said on israel army radio that

to a palestinian state 
also sunday a riot erupted outside military court in the west 
bank town of ramallah reportedly after palestinian detainees spit 
and cursed at israeli soldiers 
a spokesman said soldiers used reasonable force to quell the 
riot he added that one soldier threw a grenade into a bus carrying

market late last week 
in one case the youths showed a palestinian reporter a list 
with at least 15 names of people suspected of cooperating with 
israel or committing moral offenses such as drug dealing or 
prostitution 
palestinians have killed 150 of their fellow arabs on such 
charges during the 23monthold palestinian uprising the toll 
includes at least 23 murders in nablus 
the army has blamed the red eagles loosely affiliated with the 
marxist plo faction popular front for the liberation of palestine 
for at least nine slayings

local residents of the penalty for cooperating with israel the

market street and shot her in the head in full view of dozens of 
shoppers later members of the black panthers threatened to carry 
out further slayings of alleged collaborators 
on saturday the group kidnapped two palestinians from the 
balata refugee camp and only released them after a severe beating 
arab reporters said 
the black panthers were initially affiliated with yasser 
arafats mainstream fatah branch of the plo but they have ignored 
direct radio messages from arafat to stop the killings unless they 
have specific orders 
neither group wears a uniform but the black panthers wear 
silver necklaces saying alfahd alaswad arabic for black

more than one in five college men use 
snuff or chewing tobaco nearly twice the number who smoke 
according to a nationwide survey 
smokeless tobacco is a serious problem in american colleges 
and universities said elbert d glover a penn state university 
professor of health education who conducted the study unless we 
do something by the year 2000 or 2010 were going to experience 
an oral cancer epidemic 
a 1986 surgeon generals report said smokeless tobacco plays a 
role in tooth cavities gum disease and oral cancer and is believed 
to have the same addictive potential as cigarettes 
of the 5894 college or university students participating in 
glovers study 22 percent of the men said they dipped or chewed 
tobacco compared to 13 percent who said they smoked 
among the college or university women surveyed 2 percent said 
they used snuff or chewing tobacco while 16 percent said they 
smoked 
glover director of the center for tobacco studies at penn 
state said the recent survey is the first national study of 
smokeless tobacco use among college students the center is not 
supported by the tobacco industry 
an estimated 50 million people smoke in the united states while 
an estimated 12 million use smokeless tobacco 
chewing or dipping tobacco is most prevalent in the 
southcentral and southwestern states where 28 percent and 27 
percent of college men used smokeless tobacco glovers survey 
found 
in the northeast only 15 percent of college men used the 
tobacco products while 16 percent used them in central states 
according to the survey 
snuff which is cured ground tobacco is placed in pinchfuls 
between the cheek and gums called dipping chewing tobacco sold 
in packets of leaf plug or twists is placed in wads in the cheek 
glover said most people think smokeless tobacco as a safe 
alternative to smoking nearly eight of 10 of the students 
surveyed 79 percent believed chewing or dipping was less harmful 
than smoking 
youre just trading off different kinds of cancer glover 
said obviously if you chew your chance of lung cancer goes way 
down but your chance of oral cancer goes way up 
glover found 90 percent of those students surveyed agreed 
smokeless tobacco harms the mouth and 80 percent said it 
causes cancer 
but only 14 percent agreed smokeless tobacco is very 
harmful while 79 percent believe it is somewhat harmful or 
slightly harmful 
demand for snuff and chewing tobacco among young men has been 
strengthened by the products masculine image glover said in part 
because they are popular among professional athletes 
he said the amount of chewing tobacco consumed nationally 
increased 22 percent annually from the 1970s until 198687 when it 
declined slightly 
glover conducted the research by distributing surveys in spring 
1987 to schools with 2000 students or more in eight states picked 
randomly from eight regions in the country the questionnaires were 
distributed at physical education classes 
the states where the survey were distributed were ohio 
oklahoma minnesota colorado arizona oregon connecticut and 
south carolina

czechoslovakias premier ladislav 
adamec has emerged as a central figure in the political ferment 
triggered by massive demonstrations against communist oneparty 
rule 
adamecs clever political maneuvering and clean background 
helped build an image that made the 63yearold veteran communist 
acceptable to the opposition as a negotiating partner he was not 
involved in the 1968 sovietled invasion that crushed the prague 
spring reforms 
adamec drew both cheers and jeers from hundreds of thousands 
when he joined opposition speakers at a rally sunday hours after 
greeting dissident playwright vaclav havel with a historic 
handshake at a closeddoor meeting with the opposition 
there seemed little doubt that he had maneuvered himself into a 
position that could be decisive in helping find a way out of the 
current crisis 
a graduate of the communist party college and pragues 
university of economics adamec was little known until he was named 
head of the federal government 13 months ago 
at an early stage adamec came out cautiously against repressing 
dissent those who are blind and deaf to criticism have no right 
to hold a leading position he said shortly before taking office 
he lived up to his words when he broke with the communist 
leadership in accepting a meeting last week with opposition 
representatives 
but hopes that he would lead a changeover in the party were 
bashed after a party central committee meeting friday 
it was announced then that he had submitted his resignation late 
last month both from the premiership and from the partys ruling 
politburo 
unconfirmed reports said his decision to quit followed growing 
frustration with the orthodox policies of party chief milos jakes 
and his associates most of them were demoted at the same central 
committee meeting 
there is no doubt that this situation could turn into a 
dangerous conflict adamec warned the committee in a speech 
released sunday by the staterun news agency ctk i am against 
any onesidedness in political evaluation of forces which have 
started to move ahead 
no permanent new premier has been named leaving adamec in 
office for the time being and allowing him to defy the party 
leaderships position of refusing contacts with the opposition 
we made a positive assessment of adamecs abilities a 
spokesman of the main opposition group civic forum told a weekend 
news conference he said so far adamec was the only one in the 
leadership acceptable as a partner in a dialogue 
on sunday the crowd chanted adamecs name when he joined 
alexander dubcek leader of the crushed prague spring reform 
movement and opposition leaders in giving a speech 
but he was booed when he suggested that a twohour general 
strike called by the opposition monday be limited instead to two 
minutes to prevent damage to the economy 
it does not make much difference observed one czechoslovak 
listener most people dont work anyway between noon and 2 pm

prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki of 
poland led a prayer service sunday in a snowcovered forest where 
4300 polish officers were killed during world war ii in a massacre 
most poles blame on the soviets 
night had already fallen when mazowieckis voice sounded through 
the forest 400 miles east of the polish border 
let them lie in peace he said as he stood in front of a 
26foottall wooden cross that marks the site of the slayings 
for mazowiecki and other members of his solidarityled 
government the roman catholic mass at katyn during their first 
visit to the soviet union was a national obligation 
in a speech at a kremlin dinner on friday mazowiecki said that 
in order for there to be true friendship between the two nations 
the full story of the massacre must be told in august mazowiecki 
formed the first east bloc government not led by communists a move 
the soviets sanctioned 
mazowiecki told a moscow news conference that he raised the 
issue of katyn when he met soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev on 
friday 
the polish leader said mikhail gorbachev knows the meaning 
this has for us and we expect a clarification of this problem will 
occur 
mazowiecki laid a wreath in front of a long stone monument which 
pays tribute to the polish officers the momument says to the 
victims of fascism polish officers shot by hitlerites in 1941 
the soviets still maintain the men were slain by the nazis when 
hitlers army marched on moscow but most poles and western 
historians believe the soviet secret police massacred the officers 
in the spring of 1940 each man was killed with a single bullet to 
the back of the head 
with poland in the soviet orbit after world war ii it was taboo 
to speak openly in poland about soviet responsibility until the 
1980s when the birth of solidarity created a climate of openness 
recently the soviets whose reforms have led to dramatic 
political changes in eastern europe have allowed poles to travel 
to katyn earlier this year a large wooden cross was erected 
during a visit by polish primate jozef glemp 
the victory is that we are here its a victory for us in 
poland and for those trying to organize a new life here said 
aleksander haukeligowski who led the mass on sunday 
in the city of smolensk 17 miles from katyn a halfdozen local 
human rights activists demonstrated their solidarity with the 
polish view of history open the truth about katyn said one 
banner mr mazowiecki the democratic society of smolensk 
welcomes you said another 
as members of mazowieckis delegation chatted in russian with 
the demonstrators plainclothes police looked on but did not 
interfere 
mazowiecki was accompanied by soviet vice minister nikolai 
larionov during the daylong visit to zagorsk smolensk and finally 
katyn 
during a visit to the monastery of zagorsk where mazowiecki 
knelt several times in silent prayer he praised the russian 
orthodox church as a keeper of wisdom in the soviet union 
a joint sovietpolish historical commission established by 
gorbachev and polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski in 1987 to 
clear up historical blank spots has yet to deliver a final verdict 
on the katyn controversy 
however earlier this year the polish side of the commission 
concluded there is no reasonable doubt the soviets were responsible 
more than 15000 polish officers deported to three camps in the 
soviet union in 1939 after the outbreak of world war ii were never 
heard from after the spring of 1940 the katyn bodies were found by 
the germans in 1943 but traces of the other 11000 men have never 
been found 
mazowiecki was to travel to leningrad on monday from moscow to 
conclude his fiveday soviet visit

the case against a massachusetts state 
police trooper charged with rape and attempted extortion may be 
jeopardized by a lack of money to pay a stenographer the defense 
attorney said 
john c mcbride lawyer for suspended trooper robert monteiro 
said he plans to file a motion to have the charges dismissed 
because he is unable to get the transcript of grand jury 
proceedings involving monteiro 
the grand jury stenographer has refused to produce any more 
minutes of jury testimony until she is paid but the chief 
administrative judges office and the middlesex county district 
attorneys office say they havent got the necessary funds 
superior court judge james mchugh said in court tuesday he was 
frustrated that court proceedings are coming to a halt because 
funds are not available to conduct the courts business 
it threatens a case involving significant public interest as 
well as others mchugh said it is absolutely impossible for 
the defense or the prosecution to proceed without grand jury 
minutes they are constitutionally required and cant be produced 
monteiro 25 is charged with stopping four female motorists on 
the massachusetts turnpike raping two of them and trying to extort 
sexual favors from the other two in return for neglecting to issue 
traffic tickets he was arraigned sept 5 on the rape charges

firm that records and transcribes all county grand jury minutes 
said she will no longer provide transcripts until she was paid for 
past work 
according to the boston sunday globe christerson is reportedly 
owed for at least two months of work 
christerson has declined to comment on the matter 
edward rapacki first assistant district attorney for middlesex 
county said his office would be willing to pay for the transcripts 
if the state legislature provided the money 
the monteiro case is scheduled back before mchugh on friday and 
the judge has indicated he will rule under a state law that gives 
him power to appoint a stenographer and order that copies of grand 
jury minutes be made and paid for by the state

after months of delay the soviet union on sunday 
launched an attachment for its orbiting space station mir that 
features a space motorcycle and an experiment with japanese 
quail eggs 
however the official tass news agency rapidly reported 
technical problems with the kvant2 module saying one of the two 
panels of its solar battery did not open fully and that scientists 
considered what to do next 
soviet television broadcast live the nighttime launch of the 
proton booster rocket carrying the module from the sprawling 
baikonur cosmodrome 1560 miles southeast of moscow in the desert 
steppe of kazakhstan 
the kvant2 features a shower and sink an airlock for 
spacewalks and an incubator in which japanese quail eggs are to be 
hatched to study the effects of weightlessness on heredity also 
aboard the module is a space motorcycle which looks more like 
a floating armchair 
after the module docks with mir on dec 2 mission commander 
alexander s viktorenko and engineer alexander a serebrov will 
test the device outside it is designed for repairing satellites 
and rescuing cosmonauts in distress 
tass said the two cosmonauts who blasted off sept 5 are 
impatiently waiting for the module because its launch had been 
delayed twice it was originally scheduled to blast off in april 
but it wasnt ready then and a second launching planned for 
midseptember was scrapped because of problems with its electronic 
docking system 
exactly what effect on the mission the nondeployment of one of 
the solar battery panels could have was not spelled out by tass 
the data obtained from telemetry are now being analyzed 
it said a decision will be taken on the results of this 
analysis 
it was the latest snafu in the soviet space program two twin 
multimilliondollr unmanned probes to mars were lost in flight last 
year and in the past year almost every manned mission has had 
technical problems on landing 
the 20ton mir was designed to be permanently manned and it was 
the site of a record yearlong flight by two cosmonauts last year 
but it was unexpectedly mothballed in april because the kvant2 
and another addon were not ready and keeping a crew aboard would 
have cost money when lawmakers and ordinary soviets wanted rubles 
spent on earth 
the fourmonth vacancy was only the second time since mir was 
launched in february 1986 that it was unmanned 
mir already is joined with the kvant astrophysics laboratory 
another module scheduled for attachment later features a 
telescopic camera for studying the stars a docking port to link 
with the space shuttle buran and equipment to grow vegetables and 
crystals for electronics 
viktorenko 42 and serebrov 45 are to return to earth in 
early march after a replacement crew arrives on the mir

mikhail s gorbachev displayed solid support 
sunday for reform in eastern europe by endorsing socialism with a 
human face the slogan used by the czechoslovak progressives 
toppled by a sovietled invasion in 1968 
in the czechoslovak capital alexander dubcek leader of the 
illfated prague spring reforms of 21 years ago read 
gorbachevs remarks at a rally as proof of the soviet presidents 
backing for change 
two days earlier the czechoslovak communist party dumped party 
chief milos jakes and some other leaders associated with hardline 
policies in an attempt to stem the political crisis that has rocked 
the country 
with the east bloc in upheaval the soviet communist party daily 
pravda published a 2page compilation of gorbachevs thoughts on 
the future of socialism and his own program for perestroika or 
reconstruction of the economy and society 
pravda said the article was a synthesis of recent remarks by 
gorbachev 
the soviet leaders major theme seemed to be that socialism must 
modernize even adopt traits of capitalism if necessary or risk 
becoming irrelevant he offered no quick answers but said the 
process would take years into the 21st century 
he also said achievements attained under capitalism like 
equality of all before the law and general prosperity should 
not be dismissed because of ideology 
in the hullabaloo of our constant confrontation with 
capitalism we clearly underestimate the importance of much that 
has been done by humanity over the centuries the kremlin leader 
said 
on the need for soviet reform gorbachev said the people are 
tired of waiting 
many words have been spoken about the interests of man but 
they have been little reinforced with material resources and 
genuine deeds as a result in becoming a great and mighty power 
the country did not create for the masses of the people the 
conditions of life that are natural for any civilized state 
the new face of socialism is its human face this fully 
corresponds to the thought of marx gorbachev said because its 
creation is the chief goal of restructuring we can with full 
justification say we are building humanitarian socialism 
for communists the phrase socialism with a human face is 
inseparably linked to dubcek and his illfated reform movement 
gorbachev has previously supported economic and social reform in 
eastern europe and pledged the soviets would not interfere there 
but by appropriating dubceks words he made his point dramatically 
some in prague even took gorbachevs comments as a public 
admission that the 1968 intervention which led to dubceks 
overthrow was a mistake the soviet union has not yet renounced 
the 1968 intervention as it has the 1979 invasion of afghanistan 
as recently as last year the kremlin was vigorously defending 
the intervention in czechoslovakia as necessary to block 
antisocialist forces soviets also avoided any comparisons 
between what dubcek tried to do and perestroika the difference 
is 20 years foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov once 
said laconically 
in the pravda article gorbachev sounded a note of alarm about 
socialism by contrasting its present woes with the adaptibility of 
capitalism 
karl marx was wrong gorbachev acknowledged when he predicted 
capitalisms imminent demise 
unfortunately socialism has not been able to occupy the 
leaders position in structural reconversion industrially 
developed capitalist countries have apppeared in this role 
gorbachev said 
he said much of value was created under capitalism not just 
simple norms of morality and justice but principles of formal law 
ie equality of all before the law laws and liberties of the 
individual principles of the production of goods and equivalent 
exchange based on the law of value 
gorbachev defended the 1917 revolution that brought the 
communists to power in the former russian empire as a 
worldhistorical breakthrough to the future but said socialism 
has often been perverted since 
for the sake of a wrongly understood collectivism human 
individuality was ignored the development of the personality was 
slowed he said 
he also seemed to defend his reforms from charges they lack a 
clear blueprint citing the precedent of soviet founder vladimir 
lenin 
there is a deepseated belief that lenin supposedly had a 
completed program for the development of socialism in our country 
but in fact he had no such completed program he said

scientists at the university of texas at 
arlington are putting final touches on a new highspeed wind tunnel 
that is intended to boost the development of commuter space travel 
the facility expected to be in use next month is being built 
to support development of the national aerospace plane an 
experimental aircraft being designed by government and industry 
scientists to fly at up to 25 times the speed of sound 
the aircraft would be able to take and land at conventional 
airports using airbreathing engines to climb through most of the 
atmosphere and then switching to rockets to reach earth orbit 
supporters believe the program will eventually lead to aircraft 
that can fly from one side of the globe to the other in two or 
three hours 
the speed of sound is about 761 mph at sea level and officials 
say the utarlington wind tunnel will generate brief bursts of air 
up to 18 times that fast far faster than most conventional test 
facilities and far greater than the top speeds of conventional 
aircraft 
frank lu an assistant professor of aerospace engineering at 
uta said scientists will use the wind tunnel to conduct basic 
research to see how air flows around aircraft that travel at 
hypersonic speeds five times the speed of sound or more 
with hypersonic we really dont know too much lu said 
we know the interactions will be very severe 
the research and development phase of the spaceplane program is 
expected to run through 1992 when federal officials will decide 
whether to build two test planes 
the new wind tunnel at utarlington cost 200000 not including 
about 150000 worth of testchamber equipment donated by the ltv 
corp according to the fort worth startelegram

about 200 soldiers demonstrated sunday against the 
soviet army accusing their officers of torture sexual abuse and 
nepotism 
the soldiers many wearing gray wool army coats gathered in an 
icy parking lot in southwest moscow for the protest organized by 
shield a group formed last month by troopers accusing the army of 
human rights abuses 
banners held aloft by the soldiers read no to violence and 
cruelty in the ussr army and life and health to the 
soldier 
the rally coincided with recent articles in the soviet news 
media that have said the red army is falling behind president 
mikhail s gorbachevs reform program 
the army is still in stagnation with corruption and 
nepotism lt vitaly g urazhetsev told the crowd the army is 
the place today where conservative forces are concentrated 
gorbachevs reforms could be doomed by a military coup 
engineered by brezhnevera generals and marshals he said 
referring to hardline rule of the late president leonid i 
brezhnev from 19641982 
maria i kirbasova who said she heads a committee of soldiers 
mothers told the rally that army conscripts are so gripped with 
fear they are afraid to speak out when they are beaten or sexually 
assaulted she demanded that mothers be allowed to deliver food to 
their sons who she said are given the equivalent of only 260 
worth of food daily and receive a monthly salary of 1134 
but vladimir savostin an officer at the lenin 
militarypolitical academy told the crowd the army turns boys into 
men ready to be independent and hardworking after they are 
discharged he said the soldiers have the full rights of every 
citizen to seek justice 
the soviet media have depicted a different situation among the 
articles they have carried 
lt a shustov wrote in the literary journal znamya that a 
soldier in his second year of service takes on the role of a 
teacher often this socalled teaching is turned into 
torture he wrote a young soldier sometimes ends his suffering 
by shooting to death his torturer 
a quarter of the soldiers drafted this spring had police 
records 
standards of living for junior officers are close to the 
poverty level 
privileges for children of vips in the army 
the protests against alleged military abuse has gained so much 
momentum that the armed forces political department and branches 
of the communist party central committee issued statements july 6 
denouncing the news reports they said the reports were 
undermining the authority of the armed forces the prestige of 
military service and the ties between the army and the people 
articles in the governmentcontrolled press have said lax 
discipline has led to a caste system alcoholism and harassment of 
conscripts including demeaning extra duty and physical abuse 
one case prominently mentioned was that of a lithuanian soldier 
charged with killing eight comrades in 1987 the soldier said he 
attacked the others after they had beat and raped him 
virtually all men between the ages of 18 and 25 must serve at 
least two years in the armed forces the red army with about 4 
million personnel is undergoing a reduction of 500000 soldiers 
that gorbachev ordered last december

amtrak goes to trial on criminal charges 
monday for allegedly dumping raw sewage into florida waterways in a 
case that pits state law against federal law and ecology against 
economy 
amtrak which has been dumping along its rights of way under a 
federal law dating back more than a century has come under fire in 
several western states as well as florida for its sanitary habits 
the case is the first of those disputes to go before a judge on 
criminal charges 
amtrak is charged with four counts of commercial littering and 
one count of creating or allowing a nuisance to health the 
nuisance charge alleges that amtrak dumped sewage on fishermen in a 
boat under a rail trestle on may 18 
the state charges were filed after amtrak refused to stop 
dumping raw wastes on the tracks and into the st johns river and 
rice creek 
although the statute calls for fines and jail times the state 
is merely seeking to have the practice stopped said assistant 
state attorney dennis bayer who is prosecuting the case 
the railroad has threatened to suspend service to florida where 
it serves about 1 million passengers a year if the state continues 
to press its case 
it would set a dangerous precedent amtrak says if the railroad 
bowed to state law and stopped dumping sewage from its moving 
trains federal law permits the railway to dump its sewage on its 
rightofway and this overrides state and local regulations 
amtrak contends 
the railroad went into federal court in jacksonville to halt 
prosecution of the railroad on state charges but circuit judge 
robert perry refused to delay the trial pending a ruling on the 
federal case 
amtrak which operates 12 trains daily in and out of florida 
may be exempt from regulatory actions but cannot dodge criminal 
charges bayer said

sovietbacked government for more than 10 years 
pakistansupported extremists fired a number of usmade 
surfacetosurface rockets on kabul killing innocent citizens and 
causing sorrow to many families radio kabul said 
it reported most of the casualties were inflicted by rockets 
that hit a shopping center in downtown kabul 
leaders of the anticommunist insurgents who hold positions in 
the hills around kabul say their rockets are aimed at military 
targets and claim government forces fire missiles into the capital 
in an effort to discredit the rebels 
government reports have said rocket attacks on kabul since last 
june killed 400 people 
guerrillas supported by the united states control much of the 
countryside and rebel leaders have said their strategy is to cut 
transportation routes to the major cities held by government forces 
rebels have frequently closed the 200mile salang highway the 
main route between kabul and the soviet union 
western diplomats said last week that heavy fighting along the 
highway has forced a delay in the governments planned winter

blustery winds in the california 
desert sunday forced nasa to delay space shuttle discoverys return 
to earth until monday following a secret mission that put a spy 
satellite in orbit 
mission control in houston informed the five astronauts of the 
waveoff about three hours before they were to fire rockets to 
drop the craft out of orbit to start an hourlong descent to a 
nighttime landing at edwards air force base calif in the mojave 
desert 
discovery has been waved off from its scheduled landing this 
evening due to unacceptably strong winds said a statement from 
the national aeronautics and space administration 
mission control initially rescheduled the landing for 432 pm 
pst making it a daytime rather than a night landing as had been 
planned for sunday later sunday evening mission control moved up 
the landing to 252 pm pst 
winds gusting to nearly 30 mph sent small duststorms whipping 
across the edwards runways mission rules dictate that a shuttle 
not land at night if crosswinds are more than 12 mph 
another problem is that we have no upper level wind data 
because the winds keep breaking our weather balloons said nasa 
spokeswoman linda copley 
discovery carries enough fuel and other supplies to remain in 
orbit at least through tuesday if conditions remained bad at 
edwards the shuttle could land at either white sands nm or at 
cape canaveral 
edwards landings are preferred because of the long wideopen 
runways 
because the mission is classified no information is being 
reported by nasa so the reaction of the astronauts to the delay 
was not made public 
the statement did say the crew continhued to be in excellent 
condition 
this was the sixth time is 32 shuttle flights that a landing has 
been waved off by bad weather 
discovery was slated to be only the third shuttle to land at 
night its launch wednesday was the third after dark 
most news about the flight was blacked out on pentagon orders 
since discovery blazed away from cape canaveral fla nasa was 
allowed to make only periodic statements that the spaceship was 
doing fine and to announce the landing time 
the afterdark liftoff and touchdown were dictated by the need 
to put the shuttles satellite in a specific orbit and by the 
military experiments conducted by the astronauts some of the 
experiments were believed connected with the star wars missile 
defense system 
sources close to the project said earlier that the astronauts 
achieved their main goal thursday when they released the 2ton 
300 million satellite to eavesdrop on military and diplomatic 
communications in the soviet union europe africa and the middle 
east 
it was believed the astronauts also conducted research into how 
people can serve as military observers in space 
meanwhile workers at cape canaveral were preparing to move the 
shuttle columbia to the launch pad tuesday for a christmas mission 
columbia is scheduled to blast off dec 18 for a 10day trip 
during which the fivemember crew will deploy a navy communications 
satellite and retrieve a scientific payload that has been orbiting 
the earth for nearly six years

president alfredo cristiani 
suspended diplomatic and commercial relations with nicaraguas 
sovietbacked government sunday to protest the alleged smuggling of 
weapons to leftist guerrillas 
also sunday police arrested an american woman and said they 
confiscated some 80000 rounds of ammunition explosives 
detonators and grenades stored in her house and several other 
locations 
the move announced by cristiani in a nationally televised 
address occurred one day after military authorities discovered two 
light planes delivering weapons to the rebels fighting the 
usbacked government 
one plane crashed in eastern el salvador and army troops 
recovered mostly soviet weapons including 25 shoulderfired 
surfacetoair missiles one of the missiles was usmade three 
crewmen died and the fourth committed suicide 
the other plane apparently was able to unload its cargo after 
landing in the southern part of the country but it was unable to 
take off either for lack of fuel or other reasons and was set on 
fire by its crew which then fled

until nicaraguan president daniel ortega stops intervening in el 
salvador or loses in national elections feb 25 
missiles and other weapons taken from the wreckage of the plane 
that crashed were displayed at the news conference as cristiani 
spoke sounds of renewed fighting automatic weapons and exploding 
rockets could be heard after a pause of several days 
later the military explained in a news release that an army 
patrol had sighted a group of guerrillas near a power transformer 
on the northwest edge of the capital and helicopters and c47 
warplanes chased them as they fled up the slopes of san salvador 
volcano 
the aircraft rocketed and strafed the area for several hours 
in managua ortega said sunday it gives honor and pride to 
the nicaraguan people that the government of assassins of priests 
and religious workers in el salvador broke relations with 
nicaragua he urged other countries to break ties with san salvador 
until the cristiani government officials have punished the 
assassins 
he apparently was referring at least in part to the nov 16 
massacre of six jesuit priests their cook and her daughter at a 
roman catholic university residence other jesuits at the school 
say witnesses saw army troops enter the residence before the 
killings the government has denied responsibility 
in a statement the nicaraguan government denied any connection 
with the two planes it quoted foreign minister miguel descoto as 
saying the salvadoran government should think about the 
seriousness of the declarations and actions that the news media are 
attributing to them and about the serious implications in the 
regional peace process 
both the united states and a succession of ussupported 
governments here have accused nicaraguas leftist sandinista 
government of providing secret military assistance to the 
guerrillas in their decadeold war for power the sandinistas deny 
it 
saturdays discovery of the arms shipments was the first 
concrete evidence to back up the salvadoran accusations 
cristiani called the leaders of the rebel farabundo marti 
national liberation front or fmln puppets of communist 
aggression 
he blasted ortega and cuban president fidel castro for what he 
said was their refusal to join the wave of liberalization sweeeping 
much of the communist world 
the arrested american was identified as jennifer jean casolo of 
thomaston conn she is a representative of christian educational 
seminar an ecumenical group based in san antonio texas and set 
up to provide assistance to americans 
maj mauricio chavez caceres an armed forces spokesman told 
the news conference that 40000 rounds of ammunition for usmade 
m16 rifles 40000 rounds of of ammunition for sovietdesigned 
ak47 rifles 203 blocks of tnt and 403 detonatorcaps were found 
in the house during a 2 am raid and at other locations 
chavez said the arms cache proves church involvement with 
the fmln he did not elaborate 
us embassy spokesman jeff brown said a consular officer was 
with ms casolo throughout the predawn search and accompanied her 
to national police headquarters 
john blatz a spokesman for the christian educational seminar 
called the accusations against ms casolo ridiculous and part 
of their the governments persecution of the churches thats 
clear 
in a telephone interview he said ms casolo has been in el 
salvador since 1985 
more than a dozen churches and refugee centers have been raided 
by security forces since the rebels launched an offensive on the 
capital nov 11 
cristiani said he has asked for meetings of the un security 
council and the organization of american states he also said he 
will not attend a summit of the five central american presidents 
scheduled for next month in nicaragua 
ortega called the meeting after talks this month in washington 
on demobilizing the contra rebels broke down 
under an agreement signed by ortega cristiani and three other 
central american presidents in tela honduras the five undertook 
to demobilize the contras by dec 5 and pledged the regions 
countries would henceforth ban all aid to insurgents 
in exchange ortega agreed to hold national elections feb 25 
instead of in 1991 and promised the campaigning and voting would be 
free and fair 
both the bush administration and contra leaders have been 
insisting that demobilization take place after the elections to 
make sure ortega keeps his word 
the tela agreement was part of a peace plan to negotiate an end 
to the salvadoran and nicaraguan wars and a decadesold leftist 
insurrection in guatemala 
two rounds of ceasefire talks between el salvadors guerrillas 
and cristianis rightist government earlier this year ended in 
deadlock a third round scheduled nov 2021 was called off after 
the guerrillas launched their offensive

the communist premier held 
unprecedented talks with opposition leaders sunday and then joined 
bold reformer alexander dubcek at a prodemocracy rally before 
300000 elated flagwaving demonstrators 
the communist partys central committee attempting to regain 
control of a growing popular revolt on the eve of a planned general 
strike held a second emergency session in three days and again 
reshuffled the partys ruling politburo dumping three more 
hardliners 
they were miroslav stepan who resigned as prague party boss 
saturday miroslav zavadil who also resigned as trade union boss 
sunday and josef lenart the longestserving politburo member 
the ouster of stepan and zavadil from the politburo had been 
loudly demanded by demonstrators in the past week stepan was 
blamed for police brutality in prague nov 17 that sparked the 
current protests and zavadil was highly unpopular as head of the 
official trade unions 
seven new members including vasil mohorita chief of the 
official youth movement and miroslav valek head of the writers 
union were elected to expand the politburo to its original size of 
13 members the reshuffle on friday which dropped seven other 
hardliners including party leader milos jakes had reduced it to 
nine members 
only three original politburo members remain including new 
party chief karel urbanek 
addressing the central committee meeting urbanek proposed an 
extraordinary party congress for jan 26 which would have the power 
to elect an entirely new central committee 
the second politburo reshuffle the talks with reformists and a 
civic forum meeting with the official communist youth movement were 
part of a frenzied attempt by communist authorities to avert a 
general strike planned monday 
even the armed forces and riot police who just nine days ago 
beat peaceful protesters indicated backing for the movement during 
the rally sunday we support the democratic changes a riot 
policeman told the crowd which braved freezing weather and snow 
premier ladislav adamec became the first top official in 20 
years to share a platform with dubcek the former communist party 
leader who spent two decades in political exile after warsaw pact 
tanks crushed his prague spring reform movement in 1968 
adamec also held his first talks with leading dissident vaclav 
havel and independents in an effort to find a way to end the 
political crisis and propel czechoslovakia toward democracy 
dialogue has begun havel declared triumphantly at the 
rally which capped a week of prodemocracy demonstrations and 
hectic moves by the communists to regain control 
demonstrations were also reported in bratislava brno plsen 
hradec kralove ceske budejovice kosice and other cities 
civic forum is ready to create a bridge for a peaceful path 
from totalitarianism to civil freedom which will later be 
guaranteed by free elections havel said referring to the new 
prodemocracy group civic forum 
adamec told the cheering crowd there was no place for rivalry 
and interests of prestige 
staterun television reported 800000 people at the rally but 
reporters estimated no more than about 300000 
also sunday state television reported that the leaders of the 
peoples party a small party allied with the communists submitted 
their resignations apparently because of the antigovernment 
protest a meeting was scheduled monday to choose replacements 
dubcek urged the soviet union east germany and bulgaria to join 
poland and hungary in condemning the 1968 invasion that smashed his 
attempt to create socialism with a human face 
those countries have in various degrees accepted the reforms 
introduced by soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev hardline leaders 
who rejected change erich honecker in east germany todor zhivkov 
in bulgaria and most recently czechoslovakias jakes have been 
ousted 
the soviet union signaled support for the developments in 
czechoslovakia sunday with an article by gorbachev in the communist 
party daily pravda that praised dubceks catchphrase socialism 
with a human face 
in other east bloc developments sunday 
hungarians voted freely for the first time in more than 40 
years in a national referendum that will decide when their new 
president will be elected and whether politics should be kept out 
of the workplace 
reformminded east german communists demanded an investigation 
into alleged diversion of hardcurrency revenues from about 100 
partyowned businesses and a highranking communist said the party 
has lost 200000 members since september 
west germanys bonns die welt newspaper said soviet military 
leaders told east german troops not to use force against 
prodemocracy demonstrators in their country 
dubcek to the castle the crowd in prague yelled referring 
to the presidents residence 
at the onehour talks between adamec havel and several 
independents who mediated the opposition demanded free press 
release of more political prisoners and a parliamentary 
investigation into the nov 17 incident in which police clubbed 
hundreds of demonstrators 
the sides agreed to meet again tuesday government spokesman 
miroslav pavel said after the talks which would have been out of 
the question a week ago 
at the start of the talks adamec and havel shook hands across a 
table decorated with a small red white and blue czechoslovak flag 
the historic handshake was shown on national television which 
has played a key role in the mushrooming protests with live 
footage of opposition rallies and stormy party meetings as well as 
its first interview with havel 
the alacrity with which the authorities responded to opposition 
demands indicated they feared the strike planned for monday might 
attract workers to the prodemocracy movement there were mounting 
signs of worker support last week in the banners carried at rallies 
adamec was booed at the rally for suggesting the strike last two 
minutes rather than two hours 
pavel quoted adamec as calling the general strike a reality we 
can hardly change now but appealing to all sides to avoid 
confrontation

prime minister margaret thatcher facing her first 
party leadership challenge would be defeated soundly if a national 
election were held now according to opinion polls published sunday 
one poll also indicated twothirds of voters want mrs thatcher 
to resign before the next election which must be held by mid1992 
the polls are among the worst for mrs thatcher since she became 
prime minister in 1979 and were published only days after she said 
in an interview shes ready to fight two more general elections 
sir anthony meyer the rankandfile legislator challenging mrs 
thatcher warned of a painful process of internecine strife if 
she does not step down 
the sunday times of london poll showed the opposition labor 
party with 51 percent of voter support its highest rating in a 
decade the partys 14point lead over the conservatives 37 
percent is the biggest lead since 1980 
a poll in the observer put labor at 47 percent and the 
conservatives at 36 percent both polls indicated remaining support 
was divided among the two centrist parties the liberal democrats 
and social democratic party and other small parties 
the sunday times said its figures would be enough to give labor 
a majority of more than 100 seats in the 650seat house of commons 
the observer poll said of the twothirds of voters who wanted 
mrs thatcher to step down 44 percent wanted her to go 
immediately of the onethird of respondents identifying themselves 
as conservatives who think she should resign 11 percent said it 
should happen immediately 
mrs thatcher 64 has swept the conservatives to three 
successive election victories and is the longestserving british 
prime minister this century 
her conservative colleagues have routinely endorsed her 
leadership since 1975 when she ousted former prime minister edward 
heath this year for the first time she faces a challenger 
meyer a 69yearold former diplomat says hell run against 
mrs thatcher for the party leadership unless a more senior tory 
steps forward meyer has acknowledged he is a stalking horse 
nominations for the party leadership close thursday and voting 
is scheduled for dec 5 under a complicated voting formula mrs 
thatcher must get 57 percent of the votes to win outright if she 
does not some more prominent candidate than meyer would be 
expected to enter the race in a second ballot 
its terrific what shes done during the last 10 years but 
its so important to conserve those achievements and not put it all 
at risk meyer said sunday on sky television 
the sunday times poll said former defense secretary michael 
heseltine is the publics favorite to lead the party with a 30 
percent sounding compared with 22 percent for mrs thatcher 
among tories mrs thatcher came out ahead with 47 percent to 
heseltines 23 percent but that was a 10 percent drop for her from 
the last sounding in september and a similar gain from her former 
cabinet minister 
both polls were taken last week the times poll conducted by 
market opinion and research international mori surveyed 1068 
voters the observer poll conducted by harris surveyed 1037 
neither gave any margin of error

britain will pay vietnam 620 for each vietnamese 
refugee it forcibly repatriates on the first flight from hong kong 
the financial times reported monday 
the business daily quoting officials in the vietnamese capital 
of hanoi said britain and vietnam signed a confidential agreement 
about the payments wednesday 
the sum for further flights would have to be negotiated 
separately officials in hanoi said the newspaper said 
there was no immediate from the foreign office in london 
the report said the first repatriations will be by air before 
christmas probably on a 120seat boeing 737 chartered by the hong 
kong government the first vietnamese to be returned probably will 
be some of the 40000 held in camps who may well not qualify as 
refugees the financial times said 
it said hong kong was considering chartering larger aircraft or 
even ships to send thousands of vietnamese boat people home 
the london newspaper said vietnamese officials added that 
among those people due to be returned were criminals who would now 
be forced to suffer the penalty and single women with children 
whose prospects in vietnam would be very limited they questioned 
whether the act of returning such people could be considered 
humanitarian 
there has been criticism in britain from lawmakers civil rights 
organizations and the news media of the governments intention to 
repatriate thousands of boat people on grounds they are not 
political refugees but illegal immigrants to this crowded british 
colony 
the united states also has been denounced for not responding to 
british appeals to take some of the refugees while criticizing 
britain for the planned repatriations 
the exodus of vietnamese began after the usbacked south 
vietnamese government was defeated by communist forces from north 
vietnam in 1975 but thousands have continued to flee their 
homeland since then

the military on sunday detained 
three foreign photographers including two americans who took 
pictures of an abandoned airplane that apparently carried supplies 
to leftist rebels 
juana anderson of the associated press dayna smith of the 
washington post and daymon hartley of the detroit free press were 
held for more than six hours for not having permission to be in a 
zone where the plane was located 
hartley said he and the other two photographers were detained at 
a roadblock while leaving the area he and smith are american 
while ms anderson is peruvian 
they checked out press passes then kept us there about an 
hour said hartley 
hartley said the three were led to a nearby town where they 
were told they should have gotten permission to visit the area 
then they were taken to treasury police headquarters in san 
salvador the capital 
one colonel said welcome to the house where nobody returns 
when we got to the treasury police headquarters hartley said 
but shortly afterward the trio was released when correspondents 
from the associated press and the washington post arrived at 
treasury police headquarters some of the photographs they took 
were later published 
the crew of the plane that was photographed apparently were able 
to unload its cargo after landing in the southern part of the 
country but they were unable to take off either for lack of fuel 
or other reasons officials said the crew set fire to the plane 
and fled 
hartley said there were trenches dug near the abandoned plane 
filled with charred debris 
the abandoned plane was discovered after another plane crashed 
in eastern el salvador on saturday army troops recovered mostly 
soviet weapons from that plane including 25 shoulderfired 
surfacetoair missiles 
the supplies apparently were intended for rebels of the 
farabundo marti national liberation front who recently launched a 
major offensive against salvadors rightist government at least 
1000 people died in that offensive

opec oil ministers sunday put on hold 
tough negotiations for a new production accord to give them more 
time to consider ways of halting overproduction while keeping all 
the cartel members happy 
lack of agreement by the 13nation organization of petroleum 
exporting countries could send crude prices tumbling to as low as 
15 a barrel in the first quarter of 1990 said one ministerial 
source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
prices could slump even more in the spring to 12 a barrel 
if a deal is not worked out for the second quarter he said 
the cartel formally opened its winter strategy session saturday 
to try to come up with an arrangement that would halt production 
cheating by some members 
led by kuwait and the united arab emirates opec is producing 
more than 23 million barrels a day according to analysts its 
output ceiling now is 205 million barrels a day 
kuwait and the united arab emirates have increased their flow 
and violated their output quotas to press their demands for 
larger shares of opecs production pie 
if the ministers can solve the two countries demands they seem 
to feel the output ceiling can be bumped up to 225 million barrels 
a day in the first half of next year without upsetting the market 
prices would hold at about their current levels they believe 
opecs target price is 18 a barrel a basket of crudes 
monitored by the cartel recently was 1776 a barrel 
west texas intermediate the american benchmark crude has been 
trading around 20 a barrel middle eastern brands run several 
dollars less 
the ministerial source said two main ideas have been floated for 
resolving the problem of kuwait and the united arab emirates and 
neither was acceptable to all 
one advanced by saudi arabia and iran calls for letting 
countries with more oil produce more under this idea all but 
heavyweights saudi arabia iran and iraq would give up some of 
their shares to kuwait and the united arab emirates the source 
said 
this idea is not palatable to such countries as algeria 
indonesia and nigeria he said because such countries have serious 
money woes and depend more heavily on their oil revenues than 
others to give up some barrels would be difficult 
the alternative would be for all members including the oil 
giants to contribute some of their shares to kuwait and the 
united arab emirates 
saudi arabias influential minister hisham nazer has said 
repeatedly his country will not reduce its quarter share of total 
output 
irans gholamreza aqazadeh also has put his foot down according 
to the source 
officials are taking a look at various scenarios and juggling 
figures to see if these options could resolve their problems 
if not the ministers have a fallback option said the 
source they could divide any increase in the production ceiling 
say a million barrels a day proportionately among the 13 countries 
such a decision though would not satisfy kuwait and the united 
arab emirates the two would continue producing more than they are 
allotted and keep production high thus prices could weaken

opec is at an impasse and loosely split 
into two camps over how to meet demands fniff fails to pay gpa which 
is leasing 
the five airbus jets may sue the carrier in court to take 
possession of the jets 
since filing for protection from its creditors sept 28 braniff 
has stopped flying and laid off most of its workers who once 
totaled more than 4800 the airline which now employs about 275 
people is struggling to operate as a charter carrier 
airline analysts and experts view braniffs ability to continue 
receiving the 50 airbus jets as the companys most valuable asset 
and best chance for a successful reorganization american airlines 
has acknowledged that it has discussed with braniff the possibility 
of acquiring those planes 
braniff has been stymied however in its efforts to sublease 
the jets or sell its contracts for them 
just hours before the bankrupty filing gpa canceled its 
agreement to lease 26 airbus jets to the airline braniff sued gpa 
and several other companies involved in the leases for breach of 
contract violation of us bankruptcy laws and other alleged 
business misconduct 
because the validity of braniffs lease and purchase contracts 
was disputed the airline was thwarted in its efforts to reorganize 
under chapter 11 corcoran ruled 
lawyers representing gpa argued that the aviation company could 
lose as much as 500 million by march if braniff cannot meet its 
financial obligations for the jets or find a substitute buyer they 
said gpa did not know whether it would appeal corcorans decision
