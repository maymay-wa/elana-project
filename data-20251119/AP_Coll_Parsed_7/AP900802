an investigation ordered by covenant houses 
board of directors determined the organizations founder the rev 
bruce ritter engaged in sexual misconduct with young men at 
shelters for runaways says a published report 
the article in fridays new york times cited unidentified people 
who had read the investigative report the report is to be released 
friday the newspaper said 
the report describes sexual activity that some covenant house 
resident said they engaged in with ritter the times said 
investigators interviewed one person who told of seeing the 
priest lying in bed with a young man the newspaper quoted two 
sources as saying 
investigators also talked to other covenant house residents who 
said ritter made sexual overtures toward them that were spurned 
the times said 
the fourmonth investigation was headed by robert j mcguire a 
former city police commissioner 
ritter 63 has vehemently denied the allegations has declined 
to be interviewed for months and is said to have refused to 
cooperate with mcguires investigation the former head of covenant 
house is believed to be living in new jersey and considering 
leaving the franciscan order 
the mcguire report is said to have found no evidence that ritter 
misappropriated funds 
but the times said the report blamed covenant houses board of 
directors for failing to oversee ritter the board did not even 
know ritter was receiving an annual salary of 98000 the bulk of 
which was going into a secret personal fund the times said 
the fund called the franciscan charitable trust had 
accumulated nearly 1 million plans now call for it to be 
liquidated and for the assets to go to covenant house as ritter 
says he intended all along 
had ritter not resigned last february the board would have had 
to dismiss him the times said 
allegations against ritter surfaced last december when kevin lee 
kite 26 a drifter from texas accused the priest of luring him 
into a sexual relationship kites accusations were followed by 
similar allegations by two others including darryl bassile 31 a 
social worker from ithaca ny 
mcgruires investigation concluded that bassile was the most 
credible of ritters public accusers 
since spring more than half the 17 covenant house board members 
have resigned donations have fallen and cutbacks have been made 
sister mary rose mcgeady senior catholic charities official in 
the borough of queens is to replace ritter as head of the shelter 
on sept 1 
ritter founded covenant house in 1968 today the shelter serves 
28000 youths in 15 us cities canada and central america each 
year 
the manhattan district attorney concluded an investigation into 
ritters finances without bringing charges against him the state 
attorney generals office has not yet concluded a similar probe

the supersonic jets used by nasa to train 
space shuttle pilots were involved in close calls with other 
aircraft at least 10 times since 1986 according to a federal 
report released wednesday 
the incidents occurred in the three years period before a near 
collision in may 1989 between a t38 training airplane piloted by 
astronaut david walker and a pan am airbus carrying 166 passengers 
according to the report by the national transportation safety 
board the report was carried in thursdays editions of the orlando 
sentinel 
last month the space agency grounded walker a navy captain and 
a native of eustis fla for 60 days citing various 
infractions while he was flying the training planes 
the ntsb report included details of walkers nearcollision and 
brief mentions of the other 10 incidents nasa officials said they 
couldnt comment on the report because they had yet to see it 
the report doesnt offer specifics on the incidents other than 
to say they happened between april 1986 and april 1989 air safety 
investigators said the close calls were included among 22 
operational hazard and hazardous air traffic reports they 
obtained from nasa all involving the t38s 
ten of the reports dealt with close calls with another 
aircraft the ntsb stated nasa defines a close call as any 
incident involving the planes which possesses a high potential 
for a mishap 
jeff carr a spokesman at the johnson space center in houston 
said no one there had any information about the nasa reports cited 
by air safety investigators 
the t38 trainers based at the houston center are flown mostly 
by space shuttle pilots preparing for missions but they are also 
used by about 15 civilian instructor pilots carr said 
on may 15 1989 walker flew one of the t38s from houston to 
andrews air force base near washington for a meeting with president 
bush in making his approach he descended to 7000 feet 1000 
feet lower than he had been cleared and passed 700 feet in front 
of the airbus 
walker and another shuttle pilot navy cmdr robert hoot 
gibson were both grounded by nasa on july 9 gibsons suspension 
was for his involvement in a midair collision at a texas airshow 
that left the other pilot dead

with decolonization complete 
african leaders are turning to conflicts within their own countries 
that have killed millions of people maimed countless more and 
created 5 million refugees 
those internal wars some decades old have been largely ignored 
by the organization of african unity which devoted itself to 
supporting guerrilla movements in south africa and colonies ruled 
by europeans 
civil wars were considered beyond the bounds of the oau whose 
charter forbade meddling in the internal affairs of member states 
last month a change began for the first time since its birth 
in 1963 the organization declared that ballots should determine 
the future of the continents 550 million people not force of 
arms it did not change the charter but clearly shifted emphasis 
the issue of restoring peace and stability to african 
countries and of dismantling the apartheid system was the dominant 
theme of discussion during the 26th oau summit the 
englishlanguage daily ethiopian herald said in an editorial the 
paper is published in addis ababa headquarters of the oau 
in african eyes the continent became free of colonies when 
namibia gained independence from south africa in march africans 
viewed namibia which south africa governmed under a un mandate 
withdrawn in 1966 as a colony of the whiteruled country 
the oau and united nations have long recognized south africa as 
an independent nation but have tried to end the apartheid racial 
policy that maintains supremacy for 5 million whites over 28 
million blacks 
in previous years the oau has committed itself to financing 
guerrilla armies in areas ranging from cape verde when it was a 
portuguese colony to the british territory of rhodesia now 
blackruled zimbabwe 
it ended the june summit with the usual condemnation of 
apartheid but for the first time omitted mention of continuing to 
support guerrillabacked movements like the african national 
congress or panafricanist congress 
instead africas leaders committed themselves to increasing 
democracy within their own countries and finding peaceful solutions 
to civil wars in progress from the western sahara in the far 
northwest to mozambique in the southeast 
here is a look at the longrunning wars 
angola portugal the colonial power pulled out of this 
agriculturally rich west african territory in 1975 leaving three 
anticolonial guerrilla armies to fight for the spoils the popular 
movement for the liberation of angola won since then the marxist 
government has battled jonas savimbis national union for the total 
independence of angola which has us support zaire is mediating 
peace talks 
chad this landlocked desert nation in north central africa 
independent from france since 1960 has been torn by rebellions and 
three civil wars virtually all involved meddling and military 
incursions by chads northern neighbor libya with which it has a 
border dispute president hissen habres army scored a major 
victory over the libyans in 1987 but skirmishing continues between 
government forces and libyanbacked rebels 
ethiopia for 29 years africas longest civil war has raged in 
northernmost eritrea province where rebels of the eritrean 
peoples liberation front control virtually all the countryside and 
the port of massawa one of ethiopias two red sea harbors the 
eritreans loosely allied with the tigre peoples liberation front 
in neighboring tigre province want independence for eritrea a 
former italian colony federated with ethiopia in 1952 the tigreans 
want to overthrow the central government of president mengistu 
haile mariam the two conflicts and the famines they spawned have 
claimed more than 1 million lives 
mozambique after portugal granted independence in 1975 a 
rebel army called the mozambique national resistance known as 
renamo was organized within mozambique by the white military of 
neighboring rhodesia mozambique was the main springboard for 
incursions by guerrillas bent on toppling rhodesias whiteminority 
government whiteruled south africa took over renamo after 
rhodesia became zimbabwe in 1980 but now says it has ended support 
of the guerrillas hundreds of thousands of people have died and 
other hundreds of thousands have fled mozambique preliminary peace 
talks began last year but no real progress is evident 
somalia since 1969 when he took power in a military coup 
president mohammed siad barre has ruled this horn of africa nation 
with what human rights groups describe as nearly unmatched 
brutality insurgents in the north have fought his regime for a 
decade and new rebel organizations sprang up in the south last 
year the president has promised a referendum on a new constitution 
later this year and multiparty elections early in 1991 
sudan for seven years southern rebels who are mainly 
christian or animist have been fighting for autonomy from the 
moslemdominated central government in khartoum former president 
jimmy carter arranged peace talks last year that failed to settle 
the conflict as in ethiopia the fighting has led to periodic 
famine and the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives 
western sahara morocco and the polisario front a marxist 
group have been at war since 1977 over the desolate western 
sahara spain as the colonial power granted the region to morocco 
and mauritania in 1975 but mauritania later abandoned its claim 
the moroccopolisario conflict has been largely at stalemate in 
recent years

west germans are getting out 
their calculators and pondering whether they will be economic 
victors or victims as foreign troops begin leaving over the next 
few years 
west germany sees its mighty economic machine growing even 
stronger when land now occupied by foreign forces is made available 
for german development for the first time in four decades 
but many germans have become hooked on cashcarrying cold 
warriors and they are clearly concerned 
if all the americans leave its going to hurt each and every 
german americans spend enormous amounts of money here said 
harry spittler who owns a gift shop in kaiserslautern 
american officials say west germany gets an annual infusion of 
about 875 billion because of the us troop presence alone about 
200000 germans earn their livings directly from the american 
deployment 
if all goes well at conventional weapons talks in vienna the 
united states and soviet union will each lower their troop levels 
in central europe to 195000 apiece 
under that plan about 59000 us troops will leave west 
germany over the next five years there are currently 250000 
american soldiers here a figure that does not include dependents 
britain has said it also plans to reduce its troop levels in 
west germany by the mid1990s halving the current number of about 
66700 
the kaiserslautern area with about 70000 american troops and 
their dependents plus civilian workers has the greatest 
concentration of us troops outside the continental united states 
some of the largest us military installations in europe are in 
kaiserslautern including ramstein air base european headquarters 
for the us air force 
spittler 64 is a classic example of how some west germans hav 
developed an economic addiction to the foreign troops 
his clientele at harrys gift shop is almost exclusively 
american they are drawn by his huge stock of beer steins 
nutcracker dolls and cuckoo clocks german souvenirs that are 
especially coveted by gis scouting gifts to send to their families 
stateside 
the store clerks and spittler speak fluent english instead of 
hearing guten morgen customers are greeted with a cheery 
good morning 
if that doesnt make an american gi feel at home theres always 
the selection of american music coming from the shops stereo 
system on top of old smokey was playing one recent day 
no one expects the us military to pull completely out of west 
germany in the near future 
chancellor helmut kohl has said repeatedly west germany must 
continue to house american troops because there is always the 
chance a military threat to europe could arise again 
but even the most optimistic government officials concede that 
whatever troop cutbacks are in store weaning west germans from 
four decades of militarysupplied economic nourishment will not be 
easy 
american soldiers have their apartments here and they spend a 
lot of money shopping and in restaurants when disarmament comes 
naturally jobs will be lost as well as some economic power said 
juergen dietzen spokesman for the interior ministry of 
rhinelandpalatinate state 
rhinelandpalatinate is home to 64000 american troops more 
than 40000 state residents earn their livings either directly or 
indirectly from the american military presence dietzen said 
the state is already making plans for what to do after the 
closure of a major us air base at zweibruecken the base is to be 
shut in 1993 and there is concern for the more than 340 german 
nationals working there 
but the closing also demonstrates how west german officials seem 
to have optimistic views of life after the soldiers leave 
rhinelandpalatinate is charting plans to develop the base site 
into an industrial park with a commercial airport providing jobs 
for thousands of civilians 
we try not to get caught up in the problems that lie before 
us dietzen said we like to think of the new possibilities 
some west german communities are even trying to get the us 
government to include them as washington decides where to make its 
troop cuts 
frankfurt for example has been eyeing military sites nearby as 
possible places for economic expansion

three groups filed suit wednesday to block the 
armys plan to ship chemical weapons from west germany to johnston 
atoll saying the muntions pose a threat to the environment and 
people of the pacific 
meanwhile leaders of the 15nation south pacific forum meeting 
in port vila vanuatu issued a communique saying us plans to 
incinerate chemical weapons at johnston atoll could turn the 
pacific into the toxic waste disposal center of the world 
the communique called for closing the disposal plant once its 
current operations are completed 
greenpeace the institute for the advancement of hawaiian 
affairs and the world council of indigenous peopleshawaii contend 
the army hasnt adequately considered the risks involved in 
shipping the americanowned weapons across the ocean and 
incinerating them at the atoll 800 miles southwest of here 
we emphatically support the destruction of these weapons but 
not at the expense of the pacific environment said david 
chatfield chairman of greenpeace usa 
the groups represented by the sierra club legal defense fund 
said incineration of chemical weapons is an unproven procedure 
they said the government hasnt adequately considered other means 
of disposal including chemical neutralization 
they are seeking an injunction from the us district court here 
to block further movement of the munitions 
some 100000 rounds of nerve gas projectiles are to be shipped 
to johnston atoll during the next few months the army plans to 
store them at the facility and destroy them in an incinerator that 
is still being tested 
the suit names defense secretary dick cheney and michael p 
stone secretary of the army as defendants 
the armys action is also illegal because the army has done an 
extremely shoddy job of assessing the environmental impact of this 
scheme said skip spaulding a staff attorney for the sierra club 
legal defense fund indeed it appears that this shipment is 
merely a political gimmick to get west german chancellor helmut 
kohl reelected at the expense of us environmental laws 
the weapons from west germany would add 100000 rounds to the 
300000 rounds of nerve and mustard gas stored at johnston atoll 
since 1971 
they will be put in storage on johnston atoll until the army 
finishes testing an incinerator for the munitions the tests are to 
be completed late next year and fullscale destruction is not 
expected to begin until 1992 
the army has said moving the weapons and destroying them at 
johnston atoll would have minimal public health safety and 
environmental effects 
at the meeting of the south pacific forum prime minister bob 
hawke of australia argued in favor of the plan saying scientific 
evidence indicated the incineration was safe he said the project 
was in the interests of worldwide disarmament 
the pacific leaders whose governments represent about 25 
million people will discuss the issue friday with a us 
delegation

during his first week in office president 
alberto fujimori has quickly shaken up top government echelons and 
popular opinion seems to support his drive to stabilize the 
battered nation 
just hours after taking office on saturday fujimori strolled 
into the presidential palace for a ritual handshaking ceremony 
with the commanders of the army navy and air force 
when the names of the military chiefs were called peruvians 
were startled to learn that the heads of the navy and the air force 
werent the same officers who had been in power at lunchtime 
asked at his first news conference on sunday why he had removed 
adm alfonso panizo and air gen german vucetich fujimori replied 
the laws give this right to the president 
insiders said the president acted because the navy was rumored 
to have been fomenting a coup attempt and the air force general had 
been linked to corruption in the military 
fujimori later fired the nations four top police officials and 
his government called it a staff renovation but rumored 
corruption in law enforcement agencies was the likely reason 
the 52yearold president a mildlooking agronomist of japanese 
ancestry won an upset victory in june for a fiveyear term as 
president of perus 22 million citizens 
he promised fairness in government and honesty in leadership 
but no one expected him to act so decisively so quickly so far 
the publics reaction has been mostly positive 
fuji does not tremble the newspaper novedades proclaimed in 
a frontpage headline 
to prepare measures for combating ruinous inflation the 
president declared a twoday bank holiday he promised peruvians he 
would not touch individual savings accounts as happened earlier in 
the year in neighboring brazil fujimori said people shouldnt 
panic and they didnt 
caretas perus largest weekly news magazine called fujimori a 
house on fire and said he appeared to be shaking things up by 
going after everybody 
el comercio of lima perus biggest newspaper reported that a 
vast majority of people questioned after his inauguration gave 
fujimori a good rating 
the most important thing is the morality part said javier 
juaman a lima store clerk he was referring to fujimoris 
inaugural pledge to crack down on government corruption and make 
bureaucrats more sensitive to the problems of perus socalled 
ordinary people 
fujimori called perus legal system unfair to the masses of poor 
people and said the justice palace is better known on the street as 
the injustice palace 
one of fujimoris biggest challenges is the leftist shining path 
insurgency which has wreaked havoc in peru for years and defied 
military efforts to stifle it the president says the best way to 
defeat the rebels is by raising peruvians living standards and 
promoting economic development 
on tuesday fujimori took a walk for several blocks in downtown 
lima onlookers cheered and children shrieked foohee 
foohee which is how the first half of the presidents name is 
pronounced in spanish 
it was too early to tell how fujimoris street popularity would 
affect his ability to work with perus many political parties 
his grassroots coalition change 90 suffered serious defections 
before the inauguration and no one from the coalition wound up in 
fujimoris cabinet the coalition is in the minority in both houses 
of perus congress 
he appears to be truthful but hes also being very generic 
said sen miguel cruchaga belaunde of the democratic front 
coalition that groups presidential candidate famed novelist 
mario vargas llosa lost to fujimori in the most stunning upset in 
modern latin american politics 
fujimori had scored under 1 percent in opinion surveys at the 
beginning of the year but he swept to the front during the spring 
presidential campaign when voters became alienated by vargas 
llosas vow to introduce tough austerity measures to revitalize the 
economy 
the novelist was also tainted by the support he received from 
traditionally discredited political parties 
running on a platform emphasizing consensus fujimori took a 
centrist position in his campaign and managed to draw supporters 
from across party lines with his populist image 
legislators from many parties whooped and cheered during 
fujimoris inaugural address in the house of representatives 
minutes earlier the same lawmakers had booed and banged on 
their desks when the outgoing president alan garcia tried to make 
a farewell speech

iraq pulled out of talks wednesday 
on a 2weekold border oil and money dispute with kuwait shortly 
before it reportedly sent its forces to invade the oilrich 
neighbor 
kuwaitis tried to fend off the iraqis with heavy artillery said 
kuwait government officials contacted by telephone from bahrain 
said iraq had no immediate comment 
earlier in the day kuwait faced with the buildup of an 
estimated 100000 iraq troops at its border had tried to give a 
new impetus to talks kuwaiti officials had offered to move 
negotiations to either of their capitals 
izzat ibrahim deputy chairman of iraqs revolutionary command 
council left the saudi summer capital early wednesday without 
holding a scheduled second round of talks with kuwaits crown 
prince and prime minister sheik saad alabdullah alsabah he gave 
no explanation for his abrupt departure 
in baghdad deputy prime minister sadoun hammadi said the two 
sides failed to reach an agreement because iraq did not see any 
seriousness by kuwaiti officials in tackling the major damage 
inflicted on iraq due to their recent behavior and stands against 
iraqs fundamental interests 
hammadi had told the official iraqi news agency that the talks 
would continue as agreed with mediators president hosni mubarak of 
egypt and king fahd of saudi arabia 
ibrahims sudden departure tensed nerves in the oilrich gulf 
region even before the evasion was reported by kuwait oil 
executives said the price of oil shot up by 50 cents a barrel 
fahd had arranged for sheik saad and ibrahim to hug and embrace 
after their arrival in the saudi summer capital on tuesday and 
feted both delegations at a dinner banquet 
crown prince abdullah brought the two sides together for two 
hours of talks including a teteatete between the delegation 
leaders 
sources close to the conference said iraq maintained a hardline 
stance baghdad insisted the jiddah session be a protocol meeting 
to be followed by a working meeting in baghdad 
the kuwaiti delegation held extensive talks with the saudi 
leadership after the departure of the iraqis before his own 
departure sheik saad issued a statement affirming his countrys 
faith in continuing the dialogue 
also indicating kuwaiti acquiescence to iraqs demand for moving 
the talks to baghdad sheik saad said i look forward to 
continuing the meetings and continuing the negotiations in each of 
the two sister countries to reach a solution to all issues 
conference sources had said the saudi monarch would try to 
arrange a summit between iraqi president saddam hussein and 
kuwaits emir sheik jaber alahmed alsabah to break the deadlock 
saddam began the dispute on july 17 by accusing kuwait of 
costing iraq 14 billion by pumping more oil than the quota 
assigned to it by the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
he said kuwait stole 24 billion in oil from a field along 
their disputed border and demanded kuwait write off billions in 
loans left over from the 198088 iraniraq war 
iraqs complaints about the oil glut had seemed appeased by 
kuwaits firm pledge to respect the new opec production agreement 
reached last week in geneva 
kuwait responded to the iraqi threats by airing its own 
grievances against iraq for failing to agree to the demarcation of 
postcolonial borders but the country apparently was induced by 
the arab mediators to ignore the troop buildup and opt for 
negotiations 
until the past few days the iraqi government media had waged a 
vitriolic propaganda campaign against kuwait charges included that 
kuwait was a stooge of the united states and that the leadership 
was attempting to destroy iraqs oil and economic development

the federal savings and loan bailout agency 
wants america to know its ready to deal 
under mounting political pressure to speed the pace of the 
thrift cleanup the resolution trust corp announced a clearance 
sale wednesday aimed at unloading 50 billion in assets from 
failed sampls 
l william seidman chairman of the agency called it an 
ambitious goal that if met would move the process along in a 
really expeditious way 
but rep bruce vento dminn chairman of a house banking task 
force on the bailout said he wasnt impressed by the sales push 
given the huge task ahead 
if you set low expectations maybe youll achieve them 
vento said it seems to me theyre drowning in the job 
however seidman said the rtc operation is a complicated and 
difficult job it has taken us a little time to get organized we 
are organized now and we are under way 
in another sampl development the general accounting office 
congress auditing and investigative agency told the senate 
banking committee that it sees strong indications the justice 
department is gearing up to go after sampl criminals however it 
said it is too early to determine if the effort will be enough 
the gao said the justice department needs to devise a better 
system to allow top officials in washington to track the progress 
of the fraud fight in regional us attorney and fbi offices 
what seidman dubbed the great fall inventory clearance sale 
marks the second phase of his agencys cleanup effort in the first 
phase called operation clean sweep the rtc concentrated on 
selling the failed institutions and their deposits 
but it ended up keeping a large share of the failed thrifts 
sour loans problem real estate junk bonds and other assets vento 
and other democrats in congress had complained that selling 
institution franchises represented scant progress unless 
accompanied by substantial asset sales 
phase 2 is aimed at whittling the rtcs inventory sales 
proceeds will offset what the agency has spent to pay off 
depositors or to entice private investors into taking over 
insolvent institutions 
the bottom line is the better job we do the less the taxpayer 
has to pay seidman said 
among the sales techniques employed will be an international 
satellite auction of 71 major properties bulk sales of 
packages of similar properties and the use of 15 special sales 
offices stretching from king of prussia pa to costa mesa calif 
the satellite auction is scheduled for nov 15 in dallas 
bidders in nine other us cities and london and tokyo will be able 
to participate via satellite television hookup the other us 
cities are chicago denver houston los angeles miami new 
orleans new york phoenix and san antonio texas 
seventyone properties valued at 300 million will be offered 
38 in texas 12 in florida eight in colorado six in arizona four 
in california two in louisiana and one in illinois 
they range from kings crossing golf course amp club in corpus 
christi texas to the opulent western savings corporate center in 
phoenix 
two bulk sales one of hotel properties in the east another of 
apartments in florida will be ready to go by the end of august 
in all the rtc plans by dec 31 to sell 137 billion in assets 
left over from previous sampl sales 67 billion in singlefamily 
mortgages 33 billion in securities 16 billion in real estate 
and 21 billion in other assets 
it plans to get rid of an additional 36 billion in assets 
either by selling them directly from failed but stilloperating 
thrifts in its control or by selling the assets when it sells the 
institutions 
also an estimated 30 billion in assets will be put under the 
management of 200 to 300 private contractors 
the rtc by june 30 had seized 454 failed thrifts resolving 
207 of them it plans to resolve an additional 130 by the end of 
the year 77 in the julyseptember quarter and 53 in the 
octoberdecember period leaving it with 117 institutions 
however seidman cautioned that the cleanup would not be even 
half finished officials expect at least 250 more failures and 
possibly as many as 450 
seidman warned as he has previously that the rtcs plans 
depend on congress providing new money for the bailout in september

smokers carrying a stillunidentified gene are 
more likely to develop lung cancer at an early age according to a 
study that traced smoking and lung cancer histories in 337 
louisiana families 
the study published in the journal of the national cancer 
institute on wednesday said there was a clear genetic component to 
the early onset of lung cancer among smokers however it said the 
gene plays a lesser role in cancer among smokers late in life 
if you smoke long enough itll get to you eventually 
regardless of what genes you are carrying said thomas a 
sellers a university of minnesota scientist who was the lead 
researcher in the study the genetic component influences the age 
of onset of the disease 
he said that statistically about 27 percent of the smoking 
population will get lung cancer over a lifetime 
but in sellers study of lung cancer and smoking in the 
louisiana families there was a clear indication that some were more 
likely to get lung cancer at an early age the pattern he said 
was suggestive of an inherited gene that leads to an earlier onset 
of the disease 
the study involved white families of about the same economic 
status sellers said the study gathered data through interviews of 
family members and took into account the amount of smoking of those 
with lung cancer 
sellers said the statistical model derived from the study shows 
that the influence of both smoking and the gene would result in 
706 cases of lung cancer per 100000 people at age 50 
cases attributable to smoking alone when the gene is not 
present would be about 467 per 100000 and cases due solely to 
the gene would be about 464 per 100000 he said 
as the population ages however the effects of the gene shrink 
while the influence of smoking alone goes up 
at age 60 sellers said there would be 330 cases per 100000 
due to the interaction of the gene and smoking with 473 cases 
attributed to smoking alone and 116 to the gene alone 
at age 70 said sellers the vast majority of lung cancers among 
smokers must be attributed to smoking alone he said the cases 
resulting from an interaction of the gene and smoking would be 
about 498 per 100000 while the number attributable to smoking 
alone would be 2776 per 100000 cases among nonsmoking carriers 
of the gene would be 359 per 100000 
the study said the suggested gene interacting with tobacco 
smoke would account for 69 percent of the lung cancer cases among 
50yearold smokers 47 percent among smokers aged 60 and only 22 
percent among those still smoking at age 70 
were reasonably confident that there is a gene involved 
here said sellers but identifying the gene will require 
sophisticated genetic studies of blood samples he researchers now 
are collecting those blood samples 
in a journal editorial commenting on the study george e 
bonney an epidemiologist at howard university cancer center in 
washington said the study was so large and the observed genetic 
effect appears so strong that the conclusion about genes 
influencing the early onset of lung cancer among smokers is 
unlikely to be false 
the national cancer institute which publishes the journal is 
one of the governments national institutes of health studies in 
the journal are evaluated by experts in the appropriate academic 
fields before the work is published

the justice ministry has launched a new 
investigation into the 1984 police killing of a prosolidarity 
priest to determine if higherups of the former communist 
government were involved 
a new inquiry into the slaying of rev jerzy popieluszko 
officially was opened july 24 the justice ministry said tuesday in 
a statement to the official pap news agency 
the murder of the popular priest shocked the nation which last 
year elected a solidarityled government to replace the communists 
popieluszkos sermons counseling perseverance after the 
imposition of martial law in 1981 to crush solidarity had drawn 
tens of thousands of people and made him a national symbol of 
resistance to authoritarian communist rule 
four security service officers were convicted in a hastily held 
trial of abducting beating and drowning popieluszko in october 
1984 but communist prosecutors at the time said there was no 
evidence of higher involvement 
however the convicted ringleader of the killers capt grzegorz 
piotrowski hinted in a letter to former interior minister gen 
czeslaw kiszczak made public last month that the killing had been 
carried out with the knowledge of superiors 
the opening of the new inquiry comes only three weeks after the 
resignation of kiszczak who as head of the interior ministry was 
in charge of the security service at the time of the popieluszko 
killing 
the solidarityled government of prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki now has a civilian in charge of the interior ministry 
who is systematically scouring the department and replacing 
personnel

president bush proposing an orderly 
longterm reduction in the nations military arsenal is backing a 
25 percent cut in the armed forces by the mid1990s administration 
and pentagon sources say 
bush was slated to make the proposal in a speech today in aspen 
colo as his 307 billion defense budget for fiscal 1991 has come 
under severe attack on capitol hill 
the president will lay out the broad outlines of his new 
strategy for the nations defenses and how our military must 
respond based on the changes in the world that have occurred 
said a senior administration official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
in a speech to the aspen institute bush planned to offer 
support for two hotly debated weapons programs the b2 stealth 
bomber and the strategic defense initiative and support a 25 
percent cut in the armed forces by the end of 1995 the source said 
a similar cut in the nations arsenal of troops and weapons was 
laid out by defense secretary dick cheney as an option for budget 
negotiators in june but it was derided as overly cautious by 
critics seeking additional budget savings 
bush planned to make the address after conferring with british 
prime minister margaret thatcher in aspen it will be the fourth 
time bush and mrs thatcher have met in as many months 
bushs speech comes two days after the house armed services 
committee cut 24 billion from the 307 billion the president had 
requested for defense spending in the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
the panel voted to halt production of the b2 bomber and slashed 
almost 2 billion from bushs request of 47 billion from the 
antimissile strategic defense initiative commonly known as star 
wars it also cut military personnel by 129500 and scaled back on 
two nuclear missile programs 
in june cheney said a 25 percent force reduction could save 
86 billion over five years as the pentagon retired six active 
duty army divisions 111 navy ships and 11 air force tactical 
fighter wings and removed 442000 men and women from the 
militarys 21millionmember active duty ranks 
appearing wednesday evening on public televisions 
macneillehrer newshour the defense secretary hinted that even 
more changes could be in store he said he had new base 
closings to announce possibly as early as next week 
but cheney also complained that while the house wanted him to 
cut personnel members were balking at closing unneeded bases 
bush said on july 20 at a strategic air command base in 
cheyenne wyo that we must have an orderly builddown not 
some kind of a fire sale in defense 
he indicated then that he could live with the 18 billion that 
the senate armed services committee voted to cut from his defense 
budget but he implored congress to hold the line at that 
already painful reduction 
the senior american official said the presidents remarks would 
follow along the lines of those made by cheney and gen colin 
powell the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
both have called repeatedly for an orderly planned reduction in 
troop strength so that the allvolunteer force is not gutted and 
morale destroyed 
powell has ordered a study to assess the base line force 
that the nation needs to be a superpower another source said 
mrs thatcher is scheduled to address the closing session of the 
aspen institute conference on sunday like bush she is under 
pressure at home to deliver a peace dividend reflecting the 
changing face of europe and reduced eastwest tensions 
while the united states grapples with how to reduce the pentagon 
budget mrs thatchers defense secretary tom king announced 
plans last week to reduce the size of the british army by 25 
percent over five to seven years and cut its forces in west germany 
in half king also outlined cuts in the british air force and navy 
but said britain would retain its nuclear arsenal 
cheney was flying separately to aspen to attend the symposium at 
the nonprofit institute marking its 40th anniversary of bringing 
political business and cultural leaders together to discuss global 
issues

the house easily approved a 1990 farm bill 
that limits subsidies but is faulted by the bush administration for 
not achieving enough savings 
i think the basic skeleton of legislation will stay 
together agriculture committee chairman kika de la garza 
dtexas said wednesday night after the houses 32791 vote the 
main problem is going to be numbers with the budget summit 
the administration has threatened a veto if costs in the bill 
are not decreased 
the administration wants no program said de la garza 
they are trying to use the budget to achieve that end 
but he said the votes in the house and senate where a version 
of the bill was approved 7021 last friday show strong 
congressional intent to continue farm support programs 
the cost for the price support programs in the bill is between 
53 billion and 55 billion over the measures fiveyear life 
nearly the same as the senate version 
besides setting subsidy levels for many crops the legislation 
establishes programs for agricultural exports nutrition 
conservation food safety forestry research and virtually every 
other endeavor of the agriculture department congress writes a new 
farm bill every five years 
the support limits in the house bill represent a critical 
difference with the senate measure de la garza said he believed 
they would be retained by the joint conference committee that will 
create a final version of the legislation 
rep edward madigan of illinois ranking republican on the 
agriculture committee voted against the bill saying it would be 
too costly 
he said he thought it more closely resembled the policies of the 
1981 law which led to record spending than the 1985 law that 
congress and the administration said initially would be the 1990 
bills model 
rep jerry huckaby dla an agriculture committee member 
offered the amendment to the bill that caps subsidy payments that 
proposal approved 37545 would impose limits of 
100000 a year on the total deficiency payments paid to a 
single farmer these are the direct subsidies paid when market 
prices are below a target price established by the government 
100000 a year on marketing loans to one farmer this is the 
money farmers keep if world prices are less than the government 
established loan rate paid farmers to cover the cost of planting 
200000 a year on all payments to a single farmer 
supporters of huckabys amendment fended off a coalition led by 
rep silvio conte rmass who wanted 50000 limits on the 
payments and other restrictions 
the house also put the honey program on a sliding subsidy scale 
going from a maximum 200000 per producer in 1991 to 100000 in 
1994 
the debate over limiting subsidy payments led to angry shouting 
between members about fiscal responsibility the most emotional 
moments however came when rep bill frenzel rminn proposed to 
cut spending on food stamps and other nutrition programs that were 
expanded by the bill 
that section of the legislation is called the mickey leland 
domestic hunger relief act in memory of the texas congressman 
killed last august in a plane crash in ethiopia while visiting 
refugee camps leland chaired the house select committee on hunger 
i think its a sad commentary rep leon panetta dcalif 
said of frenzels amendment 
the costs of this bill are included in the budget resolution 
and they meet the requirements of the budget resolution said 
panetta who is chairman of the house budget committee in the 
name of mickey leland in the name of the right kind of priorities 
in the name of human decency defeat this amendment 
the house agreed with panetta rejecting the amendment 33683 
other amendments added to the house bill wednesday brought it 
into conformity with the senate breakthroughs in food safety and 
environmental protection these include a ban on exports of 
pesticides not allowed for use in the united states and a 
requirement that farmers keep records of the pesticides they use

scientists today reported finding the first 
treatment capable of relieving and even curing chronic hepatitis b 
one of the worlds biggest killers 
a study in the new england journal of medicine indicates that 
shots of a synthetic form of the natural protein interferon can 
prevent the virus from destroying the liver in nearly half the 
people chronically infected 
one in 10 victims can be cured while the drug had no benefits 
for 60 percent of the 169 people studied in clinical trials 
researchers said 
hepatitis b is the chief underlying cause of liver cancer and 
cirrhosis and the worlds ninthleading cause of death just behind 
lung disease and well ahead of aids according to the world health 
organization 
an estimated 1 million to 15 million people in the united 
states are longterm carriers of the hepatitis b virus at least 
half of them have liver disease worldwide 300 million people or 
5 percent of the worlds population are chronically infected 
until now there has been no treatment or cure for the virus 
this is an encouraging result all of us would feel a lot 
happier if we had a better treatment this spurs us on to find 
that said dr baruch s blumberg of the fox chase cancer center 
in philadelphia 
blumberg won the nobel prize in medicine in 1976 for identifying 
the virus 
the latest research which involved 169 people at 12 hospitals 
confirms several smaller studies suggesting that interferon works 
other studies have also shown that interferon works against 
hepatitis c another serious but less common variety of the virus 
although the food and drug administration has not yet 
recommended interferon for hepatitis b physicians can use it any 
way they choose and blumberg said some doctors have already begun 
prescribing it for this disease 
doctors said the latest study is big enough so physicians can 
use the results to predict how interferon will affect their 
patients if as seems likely it becomes the standard medicine 
for hepatitis b 
we can be relatively sure what doctors will find in practice 
ten percent will be cured and 40 or 50 percent will be made better 
and their liver disease will be stopped in its tracks said dr 
robert p perrillo of the st louis veterans affairs medical 
center the principal author of the study 
he defined a cure as the complete disappearance of the virus 
experts cautioned the treatment should be used only for those 
with chronic infections who show signs of liver damage 
the results were published along with an editorial by dr jay h 
hoofnagle of the national institute of diabetes and digestive and 
kidney diseases 
for now interferon alpha offers the best hope for treating 
chronic hepatitis b hoofnagle wrote 
hepatitis is likely to become the first major use for 
interferon isolating the natural diseasefighting substance was 
one of the early goals of genetic engineering 
in a decade of testing interferon has turned out to be useful 
against a variety of diseases none as common as hepatitis the fda 
has approved use of the drug for hairycell leukemia aidsrelated 
kaposis sarcoma and genital warts 
in hepatitis b perrillo said the treatment appears to offer the 
best chance of a cure if given during the first two years of 
infection

in the beginning there were the charts huge 
sheets of cardboard resembling the visual aids a teacher uses to 
hold the class attention during a complicated lesson 
there was the timeline chart ranging from 1984 to 1990 with 
bright red and green blocks signifying the months or seasons when 
various witnesses said they had used drugs with mayor marion barry 
there was the lengthy locations chart subdivided into 
hotels businesses private residences government offices and 
boats 
and there was the drug activities with charles lewis chart 
neatly broken down by date place and drug 
barry himself subdued and somber sat directly under the lewis 
chart during closing arguments in his drug and perjury trial 
wednesday his chin resting in his hand he listened intently as 
assistant us attorney judith retchin recapped allegation after 
allegation of drug use and his own lawyer acknowledged that barry 
was a cocaine user 
the chief executive officer of our city the chief law 
enforcement officer of our city was using drugs retchin said 
emphatically to the jury her gold earrings glinting and her hand 
chopping the air 
there are no saints among us barrys lawyer r kenneth 
mundy said later after the defense had covered up all the charts 
the mayor swaggered in wednesday wearing a bright yellow red 
and green kente cloth an african neck scarf but he took it off as 
the jury filed in and the mood in the spare crowded courtroom 
turned businesslike his wife and mother endured the proceedings 
from the second row 
only 18 tickets were available to the public and some people 
came as early as 8 pm the night before in hopes of getting one 
the passes were distributed amid controversy over who had arrived 
first and someone who wasnt fast enough was thwarted trying to 
enter the courtroom on a forged pass 
those who made it heard some brutally pointed final volleys from 
retchin 
she called barry paranoid compulsive irresponsible a liar 
she compared him to the hub of a wheel with spokes pointing to all 
those who helped him maintain his secret drug habit she likened 
him to a child who blurted out a lie that he had not given his 
friend charles lewis any drugs she compared him finally to a 
treacherous general abetting the enemy 
it was his choice and he could not say no she said the 
general was working with the other side 
mundy who was finishing his presentation today maintained the 
government had not proven its case but his characterizations of 
his client were scarcely more flattering than retchins 
we do not intend to indicate or claim that mr barry did not 
use cocaine he told the jury nor do we mean to indicate that 
there was not some kind of conduct that was not popular or not 
appropriate 
if barry was particularly disturbed by any of this he did not 
show it by changing his expression during breaks he casually 
combed his hair made a phone call offered his opinions of the 
sketches drawn by the front row of courtroom artists 
the artists had started the day abuzz over an accusation by the 
mayors press secretary that they were deliberately darkening the 
skin of a government prosecutor thus stressing that barry was 
being tried by a fellow man and by implication undercutting 
charges that the government was unfairly going after black 
officials 
one artist for a television network contemplated the 
professional problem of depicting a lightskinned black maybe i 
need a new marker she said no one ever noticed this before

the number of nevermarried women rearing 
children on their own increased almost as much in a new twoyear 
survey as it had in the previous seven years the census bureau 
says 
in a biennial report released wednesday the bureau and the 
department of health and human services said that in 1987 there 
were 26 million nevermarried women with children under 21 whose 
fathers were absent from the home 
in 1985 the last previous count the figure was 2 million in 
1983 it was 19 million it was 17 million in 1981 and 14 
million in 1978 when the first survey was made 
although the survey showed that women were doing better than 
previously at getting child support those who had never married 
were faring much more poorly than those who were divorced or 
separated 
the report said support payments received by women with children 
under 21 in 1987 averaged 2710 an increase of 16 percent over 
1985 after adjusting for inflation 
of mothers who were separated or divorced 74 percent were 
getting child support for those who had never married the rate 
was 20 percent 
commenting on the report jo anne b barnhart assistant 
secretary of health and human services for family support said 
we must never lose sight of the fact that both parents have an 
obligation to financially care for the children they bring into the 
world 
hhs secretary louis sullivan said the report indicates that 
progress is being made but vigorous enforcement of child support 
laws must continue 
the report said 94 million women age 18 and over were rearing 
children under 21 whose fathers were not living in the household 
this is an increase of 7 percent since 1985 
the total amount of child support received in the year was 10 
billion or 69 percent of the total of 146 billion due 
about onethird of the mothers were living in poverty the 
poverty rate for black women was 53 percent about twice that for 
white women but about the same as the rate for hispanics

newspapers that once trumpeted government 
propaganda have now hailed the end of most censorship rules even 
printing the official approval stamp of the censor agency that was 
once illegal to mention 
goodbye censorship read a headline in izvestia about the 
soviet unions first press freedom law which took effect wednesday 
and guarantees broad rights for journalists and potential 
publishers 
almost everything was forbidden even mention of the existence 
of the censorship agency glavlit itself said izvestia the 
main government newspaper the truth was the main secret 
izvestia celebrated the occassion by publishing a photograph of 
glavlits approval stamp on its front page 
that minor act of rebellion marked a watershed day in the 
gradual freeing of speech since mikhail s gorbachev came to power 
in 1985 
the press and other mass media are free and censorship of 
the mass media is forbidden says the new law passed by the 
supreme soviet legislature in june after months of debate 
editors said in their news pages that the new legal guarantees 
wont stop attempts at interference overnight the new law does not 
abolish glavlit which stands for the main administration for 
safeguarding state secrets in the press glavlit will still have 
the power to censor articles construed as calling for the violent 
overthrow of the government promoting racial or religious 
intolerance or publishing propaganda for war violence or cruelty 
in addition the shortage of newsprint and its increasing costs 
could be a major barrier for independent publications 
the most daring editors have been pushing the limits of 
gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness since he came to power 
tass the official government news agency already has a 
competitor in interfax a news service set up by radio moscow last 
year to earn hard currency sent to subscribers by facsimile 
machine interfax quickly earned a place on the pages of world 
newspapers with scoops like gorbachevs plan to ask the communist 
party to give up its monopoly on power 
the governments novosti press agency chose wednesday to 
announce that it is being transformed from a propagandapublishing 
institution to an information agency albeit one dedicated to 
reporting on gorbachevs reform policy called perestroika 
it is felt that tass and the daily newspapers must advise on 
the events of the day so we are obligated to integrate more 
facts into our work said novosti chairman albert vlasov in 
izvestia on wednesday 
just two weeks ago gorbachev issued a decree loosening controls 
on the state television monopoly until then only groups approved 
by a state committee had access to soviet television and as a 
result the communist party received large segments of air time 
the decree said no one party or group should monopolize air time 
some of the most dramatic changes are in the works at the feisty 
weekly moscow news which is planning to go independent of novosti 
selling stock ads and subscriptions 
seven years ago it was a multilingual propaganda sheet known 
for articles that claimed 12 million people were starving in the 
united states now its weekly thrust into forbidden territory has 
made it one of the most popular newspapers in the country 
but its faithful readers must crowd around the copies posted on 
the newspapers wall in downtown moscow because it has been barred 
from selling subscriptions for its russianlanguage edition inside 
the soviet union 
editor yegor yakovlev announced in this weeks edition that the 
newspaper will ignore the restrictions and start a subscription 
drive in hopes of earning enough to pay for the additional 
extremely scarce newsprint 
tass reported wednesday that market reforms are bringing an 
abrupt jump in the price of newsprint and printing services it 
predicted that the retail price of most publications will double 
and that many of them will die off 
to establish a new publication or news organization the new law 
says soviets need only provide their name address frequency of 
publication circulation figures and source of financing 
journalists new rights include the right to attend meetings and 
be present at the scene of disasters the right to refuse to 
prepare reports that go against a journalists convictions and the 
right to hold interviews with officials they now can withdraw 
their byline if the contents of a story are distorted by editing

president bush is relying on the senate to 
salvage his 1991 military budget after the house armed services 
committee significantly cut the b2 bomber and the strategic 
defense initiative 
the fate of the stealth aircraft which at nearly 865 million 
each is the costliest airplane ever built was expected to be the 
first issue today as the senate begins considering its version of 
the defense bill 
bush meanwhile was expected to use an address today to call 
for a 25 percent reduction in military forces by the mid1990s 
while maintaining support for the b2 stealth bomber and the 
antimissile strategic defense initiative administration and 
pentagon sources said 
the president wants a rational builddown one source said 
in advance of bushs planned speech at the aspen institute in 
aspen colo 
last month the senate armed services committee approved a 289 
billion defense package that leaves intact the presidents request 
for 46 billion for two radarevading b2 bombers in the fiscal 
year beginning oct 1 
since the panels action congressional support for the planes 
has continued to diminish with the latest blow coming tuesday 
night when the house armed services committee agreed to halt 
production at the 15 bombers in development 
the house panel also cut 24 billion from bushs overall request 
of 307 billion in military spending for fiscal 1991 slashed 
nearly 2 billion from the budget request of 47 billion for the 
strategic defense initiative or star wars and reduced military 
personnel by 129500 
the senate armed services committee was kinder to bushs 
proposal trimming 1 billion from sdi and cutting active duty 
troop strength by 100000 as well as agreeing to the b2 request 
possible amendments to the defense bill include one from sen 
sam nunn dga chairman of the committee and sen john warner of 
virginia ranking republican to set aside procurement money for 
the b2 until critical tests have been completed 
that provision may undermine harsher amendments that could come 
from republican sen william cohen of maine and democratic sen 
patrick leahy of vermont 
one amendment from the two b2 opponents would halt production 
of the aircraft for one year another amendment would allow six 
planes to be built and the testing program to continue 
privately lawmakers who oppose the aircraft say they have 40 
votes to prevent bush from building a fleet of 75 aircraft 
recently nunn and warner warned the president that unless he 
lobbies personally for the aircraft it will fail in the senate 
but their possible amendment might prevent the b2 programs 
demise in the senate 
other possible amendments include one to reduce funds for the 
phase 1 of the sdi program restore the 11 billion that the 
senate panel eliminated for the milstar communications satellite 
program and a provision to cut us troops in south korea from 
45000 to 30000 
one provision certain to set off a firestorm of protest and 
possibly delay completion of the bill is an amendment to permit 
abortions at military hospitals abroad 
currently a ban exists on using defense department money to pay 
for abortions except when the life of the mother is in danger the 
ban does not say whether military personnel who pay for the 
procedure can use government facilities 
sen tim wirth dcolo cosponsor of the amendment said in a

the soviet union announced today that 
it will stop making a railbased mobile intercontinental ballistic 
missile but did not commit itself to removing those already in 
place 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze made the announcement 
after two days of talks in this eastern siberian city with 
secretary of state james a baker iii and before reporters had 
learned of iraqs invasion of kuwait 
both officials told reporters outside a guest house where they 
met that their 10 hours of discussions produced no major 
breakthroughs on what had been expected to be their main focus the 
12yearold civil war in afghanistan 
but the announcement about the soviet ss24 missile indicated 
they had made some progress on arms control 
the meeting the 11th this year between baker and shevardnadze 
was the most informal the diplomats cruised the angara river and 
went fishing shevardnadze landed a trout but baker came away 
emptyhanded 
shevardnadze standing along with baker on a patio said the 
soviet military would cease production of the missiles on jan 1 
he said the soviet military would continue to deploy until 1991 
not many of the missiles it has already produced 
the removal of missiles already in place he said was a subject 
of negotiations between us and soviet teams in geneva 
according to the 1989 edition of the annual us defense 
department publication soviet military power the soviet union 
began deploying the railbased version of the ss24 missile in 1987 
and had about 58 of them 
the ss24 carries 10 warheads and has a range of abut 6200 
miles limits on mobile landbased missiles were one of the 
outstanding issues in start talks on slashing the superpowers 
stockpiles of longrange nuclear weapons 
other bigger sticking points in the negotiations are curbs on 
modernizing the soviet unions biggest strategic missile the 
ss18 and the backfire bomber and on transfers of missiles to 
third countries 
shevardnadze did not say why the soviet union was taking the 
step but the kremlin is under pressure to cut its defense budget 
so it can spend the money on solving chronic economic problems 
we welcome the announcement baker said before flying to 
mongolia for the last stop on his fournation asian tour he added 
however that it doesnt at this point at least change our 
negotiating position in start 
us officials indicated earlier this year that they might offer 
to give up plans for a railbased mx missile if the soviets give up 
the ss24 
baker and shevardnadze discussed the war in afghanistan on 
wednesday night and this morning but the soviet envoy told 
reporters i cannot say we can report any kind of breakthrough on 
afghanistan 
the soviets arm the afghan government while the americans 
supply the guerrillas fighting it with military aid 
baker told reporters there were two main stumbling blocks to a 
settlement 
the makeup of a commission to ensure free and fair 
elections 
which powers the current government headed by prosoviet 
president najibullah might transfer to an interim government 
during elections so candidates are ensured a fair shake 
baker said soviet and american experts will try to resolve 
differences over these points when they meet in washington he did 
not say when the meeting would take place 
us and soviet officials reportedly have been working on a plan 
for najibullah to hand over some power to a council of afghan 
forces as a runup to a nationwide election 
the composition of the council is now in dispute usbacked 
afghan rebels disagree about who should be on the council baker 
alluded to that at the news conference 
we are moving closer together on afghanistan having said 
that i dont think you should take that to mean necessarily that 
those whose interests we have been allied with in the past are 
necessarily moving together he said 
in three meetings including one wednesday night in a riverside 
fishing lodge in the siberian wilderness baker and shevardnadze 
also discussed preparations for a third summit meeting between bush 
and gorbachev 
shevardnadze said not date had been decided for the summit but 
that it would be held in moscow he also announced that baker us 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher and leading american 
businessmen would travel to moscow in september for talks on 
ussoviet economic cooperation 
baker indicated this primarily would involve ways of stimulating 
us business investment in the soviet union in dire need of 
western help to cure its ailing economy 
a soviet source said that during their wednesday morning 
meeting shevardnadze gave baker a 15page outline of areas for 
economic and scientific cooperation the envoys meet next in moscow 
on sept 12

most of the 13 million scofflaws who owe a 
total of 66 billion in federal taxes are ordinary workers and 
businesses but the biggest include a drug dealer some rich oil 
investors and a halfdozen giant bankrupt companies 
the internal revenue service says 21 taxpayers owe more than 50 
million apiece a total of 36 billion among them about 3300 are 
responsible for more than 145 billion of the agencys accounts 
receivable 
irs commissioner fred t goldberg jr told the senate 
governmental affairs committee on wednesday that the agency is 
making progress in reducing accounts receivable which are taxes 
that have been assessed but not paid 
he noted for example that the irs this year is collecting 
472000 in delinquencies for each staffer in the collections 
division up from 388000 two years ago 
at the same time however i want to emphasize that we have a 
long way to go and the task is exceedingly difficult goldberg 
said making a serious dent in accounts receivable he said will 
require modernization of the agencys 30yearold computer system 
more money for more personnel and training and further 
simplification of tax laws 
paul l posner associate director of congress general 
accounting office said the irs is losing the battle because 
accounts receivable over the past six years grew twice as fast as 
total tax receipts continuation of that trend could have a 
serious negative impact on voluntary taxpayer compliance he said 
this rapid outofcontrol growth in unpaid taxes threatens to 
overwhelm the irs and is absolutely unacceptable said sen john 
glenn dohio chairman of the governmental affairs committee 
accounts receivable grew from 30 billion in 1984 to 66 billion 
last year the figure represents a sixyear accumulation of income 
payroll and other taxes assessed but not paid it does not include 
27 billion that the irs believes will never be collected because 
of death bankruptcy and inability to locate the debtor 
because of errors and duplication the irs and gao agree the 66 
billion figure may be exaggerated by as much as 50 percent 
accounts receivable are not the same as the tax gap which 
is the difference in income taxes that are collected and what would 
be collected if individuals and businesses correctly reported their 
income and deductions the gap is expected to be about 100 billion 
this year alone 
goldberg said 025 percent of the accounts receivable cases 
represent more than 20 percent of delinquent dollars 
other highlights 
six cases totaling 14 billion involve bankruptcies five cases 
totaling 106 billion involve erroneous assessments irs made 
three of the errors and taxpayers made two and are being closed 
one 61 million case is awaiting a court decision one worth 73 
million involves an unidentified drug dealer 
two cases worth 191 million involve a dispute over the 
nowrepealed windfallprofits tax on oil production and 362 
million at stake in two cases likely will never be paid for a 
variety of reasons including fraudulent investments 
goldberg said president bushs irs budget for next year is a 
good start toward reducing accounts receivable because it would 
allow hiring 1050 new collection personnel he said a twoyear 
hiring freeze has left the agency is such a state that nearly 
800000 accounts totaling 18 billion cannot be worked because of 
lack of personnel 
john pepping an irs collections officer in the laguna niguel 
calif district said the personnel shortage there is so severe 
that as a rule no account under 50000 is sent to the field for 
collection he testified on behalf of the national treasury 
employees union which represents most irs workers

us and filipino authorities claim 
that murder charges against three americans and 13 filipinos were 
filed to keep them from exposing narcotics trafficking within the 
military 
on wednesday the military charged three drug enforcement 
administration agents and 13 filipino policemen with murder in the 
killings of three soldiers including two officers during a 
reported drug bust last month 
in washington the acting chief of the drug enforcement 
administration terrence burke said the allegations against his 
men have no merit 
the dea suggested the charges may have been intended to prevent 
the three agents from testifying about drug trafficking by filipino 
military officials 
today epimaco velasco the most senior filipino charged in the 
incident resigned as assistant director of the national bureau of 
investigation he called the allegations malicious unfounded and 
baseless 
this is a very sad day for other peacekeeping and law 
enforcement people because for performing their duty this is what 
they get velasco said do you mean to say that if military 
people are involved we will just close our eyes and let these 
things go 
brig gen gerardo flores chief of staff of the philippine 
constabulary filed charges against philip needham of the deas 
bangkok office andrew fenrich chief of the dea section in manila 
and dea agent jake fernandez 
us embassy spokesman stanley schrager said all three left the 
country and have no plans to return 
flores said 10 of the filipinos were charged before a military 
court the integrated national police is part of the armed forces 
under philippine law prosecutors decide whether to indict those 
charged by police 
the charges stem from a july 10 incident in which col rolando 
de guzman deputy chief of the northern luzon command his 
intelligence officer maj frank calanog and another soldier were 
slain during what police said was a shootout during a drug bust 
dea spokesman cornelius dougherty said in washington that the 
agency was invited to testify before a commission formed by 
president corazon aquino to investigate allegations of drug 
trafficking by members of her armed forces 
he said fenrich had planned to testify but the charges rather 
effectively put the kibosh on any testimony about the facts 
concerning the armed forces im suggesting theres probably a 
causeandeffect situation there 
the national bureau of investigation claims de guzman and the 
other soldiers tried to sell 10 million worth of heroin to 
needham who was posing as a buyer shooting broke out when the 
three resisted arrest it claims 
us embassy officials have not commented on the incident

the same federal department that leads the 
fight against aids refuses to help pay the hospital costs of poor 
people who receive experimental drugs for aidsrelated infections 
that policy of the department of health and human services 
blocks treatment of thousands of people whose aidsweakened immune 
systems make them the prey of microbes that most people would only 
sneeze at witnesses told a house government operations 
subcommittee wednesday 
hhs also governs the medicare and medicaid programs which 
refuse to allow reimbursement for experimental treatments even if 
those are the only effective ones available for aidsrelated 
infections 
dr anthony s fauci head of aids research in hhs was among 
the critics of that policy 
we do not agree from the biomedical research and health care 
delivery standpoint with that philosophy said fauci director of 
the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases at the 
national institutes of health 
fauci told the subcommittee on human resources and 
intergovernmental relations that he has brought up the gap in 
biweekly meetings of the interagency hiv leadership group hiv is 
the human immunodeficiency virus that causes aids 
the response within the department is that they were very 
sympathetic with the difficulties this is posing for us in the 
conduct of our trials but a solution is not readily at hand 
fauci said 
he said the problem is an unwillingness to spend more money on 
reimbursements that are already stretching the government for 
nonexperimental hospitalizations 
hospitalization is required for aids patients with opportunistic 
infections those that a person with a normal immune system would 
resist because such infections are usually acute and patients 
must be monitored around the clock said dr fred r sattler of the 
university of southern californias school of medicine 
the hearing was called to examine the status of research into 
drugs used to prevent or treat opportunistic infections and the 
priority given by the nih to research into those drugs rather than 
an overall cure for aids 
the institutes have recently indicated they would spend a larger 
share on the drugs against opportunistic infections nih announced 
tuesday that it would give 28 million to six teams of scientists 
for research on such drugs

alaskas next governor knows that as the 
flow of alaskan oil dwindles in the 90s so will the river of 
petrodollars that has filled the state treasury for more than a 
decade 
the hard part will be convincing alaskans that oils free ride 
is almost over and that they may have to start paying their own way 
for state services 
and so the nine candidates vying to succeed democratic gov 
steve cowper are skirting specifics about what programs they would 
cut to deal with the massive deficits forecast for the coming 
decade and no candidate has embraced new taxes as a solution 
it would be suicide for anyone to come out and be very 
specific about what they would do said clive thomas a political 
science professor at the university of alaska southeast if they 
did they would not win 
part of the problem for the candidates is that many alaskans 
have been lulled into a false sense of security about the economy 
thomas said employment and wages are up homes are selling and 
international trade is growing 
how do you lead the alaska public to believe they need to cut 
back basically youre asking them to have a lower standard of 
living thomas said thats not going to go down well with 
people 
dave dittman an anchorage pollster agrees he said most 
alaskans feel they are doing well and they dont want to hear 
threatening talk of another oilrelated recession 
they dont want a change theyre not looking for a moses 
they want a guardian someone who can protect their interests 
dittman said 
oil taxes and royalties support 85 percent of the state budget 
alaska has no statewide sales or income taxes the next governor 
likely will be forced to propose broad cuts new taxes or both 
of the nine candidates vying to replace cowper who announced in 
march 1989 that he would not seek a second term five are 
considered serious contenders for the republican and democratic 
nominations in the aug 28 primary 
the frontrunner in the gop race is state sen arliss 
sturgulewski of anchorage who lost to democrat cowper in 1986 the 
other main gop contenders are jim campbell a former anchorage 
assemblyman and businessman and state sen rick halford who 
operates a hunting lodge and flying service 
the democratic race is between former anchorage mayor tony 
knowles and lt gov stephen mcalpine 
so far the differences among the candidates have been less 
obvious than the similarities all say they favor environmentally 
responsible oil exploration and development and all say alaska 
needs to expand its development of other natural resources as well 
their campaign commercials have been full of feelgood images 
cliches about leadership and the alaska spirit and little else 
no one in my opinion has really taken anything on dittman 
said theyre all saying the same thing in a very typical 
noncreative manner 
that may be changing as the primary nears the republican 
contest recently began to heat up when campbell in commercials 
aired in anchorage and fairbanks challenged the legislative 
records of sturgulewski and halford 
many observers expect the democratic race to heat up as well if 
mcalpine continues to lag behind knowles in the polls in the final 
weeks 
the lesser known candidates are republican don wright a retired 
construction contractor from fairbanks making his fourth bid 
democrat ryal white an anchorage construction worker and alaska 
independence party candidates john lindauer of anchorage and 
william derushe of north pole 
the feisty campbell is the only candidate who has been moving up 
significantly in the polls recently he said hes now aiming 
primarily at sturgulewski 
sturgulewski responded quickly to the campbell commercials 
using humor to counter what she saw as a subtle reference to her 
gender 
in one of the campbell ads the narrator speaks of the need to 
maintain state roads and buildings he concludes maintenance 
isnt sexy its just wise you can vote sexy or you can vote 
wise 
after responding to campbells other charges the matronly 
sturgulewski looks into the camera and says hes even accused me 
of being sexy well he might be right about that

the united states has viewed the oilrich 
persian gulf region as a vital part of the world since the end of 
world war ii and has deployed a continuous naval presence in the 
region since the late 1940s 
the united states has based its policy in the region on the need 
to maintain the free flow of oil from saudi arabia with the 
worlds largest proven oil reserves and iraq which ranks second 
in proven reserves 
but us relations with the major powers in the area iraq 
iran and saudi arabia have often been rocky 
with the outbreak of the 1967 middle east war between israel and 
its arab neighbors iraq broke relations with the united states 
over its support for israel and usiraqi relations plunged into 
a deep freeze for more than 15 years 
iraq was placed on a list of countries that support terrorism as 
the united states accused the baghdad government of financing 
palestinian terrorist movements 
the region grew even more vital to this country when the 
oilproducing arab countries imposed an embargo against the united 
states and other western nations in 1973 sending oil prices 
soaring and exposing the vulnerability of us consumers to the 
volatile developments in the persian gulf 
as relations with iraq and the other oil producers deteriorated 
us links to the government of iran improved iran too was rich 
in oil and the united states could count on steady supplies from 
the late shah reza pahlavi in return for consistent sales of 
american weaponry to build up his military forces 
relations with iran came to an abrupt and tragic end when moslem 
shiite fundamentalists under the spiritual guidance of ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini deposed the shah and took over the us embassy 
in tehran holding more than 50 americans hostage for 444 days 
beginning in 1979 
with its relations with baghdad and tehran mired in hostility 
the united states strove to develop good ties with the small 
monarchies bordering iran iraq and saudi arabia 
these oilrich countries in the shadow of their powerful 
neighbors turned to the united states for weapons sales and 
political support their dependence on the united states grew as 
iraq became increasingly menacing after it launched its september 
1980 war against iran 
official us policy was to remain neutral in the eightyear 
war but in an effort to obtain the release of american hostages 
held in lebanon by proiranian moslem extremists the united states 
in 1985 began secret arms sales to the khomeini government 
just before that the united states and iraq resumed diplomatic 
relations but the united states refused to sell iraq any weapons 
as the war dragged on and both combatants launched a barrage of 
attacks on oil tankers plying the gulf the united states spread 
its protection over kuwait agreeing to put us flags on kuwaiti 
oil tankers ships from the us seventh fleet escorted kuwaiti 
tankers through the gulf 
although still remaining neutral the us action was seen as 
benefiting iraq because it helped keep open the shipping channel 
that iraq needed to get its oil to foreign markets 
with the end of the iraniraq war the united states set about 
to substantially improve relations with the government of saddam 
hussein extending credit programs for us farm sales to iraq 
us oil companies sharply increased their purchases from iraq 
providing the iraqi government with badly needed cash american 
businesses pressed the bush administration to provide additional 
loan guarantees so they could enjoy an expected boom from iraqs 
postwar reconstruction 
however tensions between washington and baghdad escalated again 
earlier this year when us customs agents in cooperation with 
british authorities intercepted a shipment of devices said to be 
intended for iraqs nuclear program iraq vehemently denied the 
allegation but congress was skeptical citing iraqs continued 
development of chemical weapons 
in recent days both the house and senate have moved to adopt 
sanctions against iraq even as the administration was considering 
similar steps of its own

the bush administration condemned iraqs 
invasion of kuwait early thursday morning and said it was 
reviewing all options in its response to the iraqi aggression 
white house spokesman roman popadiuk said the united states 
deplored this blatant use of military aggression and called for 
the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of hostile troops 
from kuwait 
popadiuk said national security officials were monitoring the 
hostilities but had no exact details about the extent of the iraqi 
offensive iraq claimed in a radio broadcast from baghdad that it 
had overthrown the sheikdom 
a us official speaking on condition of anonymity said of 
iraqs claims we dont think thats the case nevertheless 
this official said iraqi troops had moved into the capital city in 
force 
they seem to have taken over several government buildings 
the official said 
the white house said it had no reports of harm to americans the 
united states has extensive business ties to kuwait and the state 
department said 3800 americans were believed to be in kuwait at 
the time of the invasion the us embassy in kuwait has a staff of 
about 80 half of them military 
the united states is deeply concerned about this blatant act 
of aggression and demands the immediate and unconditional 
withdrawal of all iraqi forces we are urging the entire 
international community to condemn this outrageous act of 
aggression popadiuk said in a statement read to news 
organizations in a 130 am conference call 
in addition the spokesman said the administration was 
reviewing all options in its response to the iraqi aggression 
the united states whose persian gulf naval patrols protecting 
usflagged kuwaiti tankers helped iraq defeat iran in the 
19801988 war has six warships in the area they have been 
conducting exercises since july 24 with forces of the united arab 
emirates some 700 miles southeast of kuwait 
the naval force includes four frigates one destroyer and the 
command ship uss la salle two kc135 aerial refueling tankers also 
have been taking part in the exercises 
the nearest aircraft carrier battle group the most powerful 
naval force in the fleet is headed by the carrier uss independence 
somewhere in the indian ocean that could be about 800 miles from 
kuwait where the gulf opens into the indian ocean at the straits 
of hormuz or it could be many thousands of miles away pentagon 
officials declined to identify the carriers whereabouts 
national security adviser brent scowcroft was chairing a hastily 
assembled task force in the white house situation room popadiuk 
said president bush was informed of the invasion about 9 pm 
wednesday 
a state department official said the department had received 
reports of gunfire in the heart of kuwait city which sits on the 
gulf and there appeared to be some penetration into the heart 
of the country 
popadiuk said the white house delivered its message to the iraqi 
ambassador in washington and to the iraqi government through the 
us embassy in baghdad 
the kuwaiti embassy in washington confirmed iraq had launched an 
offensive faleh bader director of the ambassadors office said 
we confirm there is an offensive at kuwait border and we have no 
comment 
the attack started about midnight kuwaiti time 5 pm edt 
bader said 
hours before the attack iraqs ambassador mohamed almashat 
was summoned to the state department for a meeting with assistant 
secretary john kelly 
kelly repeated to the iraqi envoy the us desire for a peaceful 
solution to the tensions with kuwait and urged iraq to respect to 
sovereignty of all nations in the region 
kelly told a house subcommittee tuesday that while the united 
states has no treaty obligations that would mandate military 
support for kuwait the united states does believe strongly in 
respect for territories of all states in the region 
congress has been pressuring bush to impose new sanctions on 
iraq over its belligerent moves toward mideast neighbors on 
wednesday the house foreign affairs committee approved by voice 
vote a bill seeking an end to iraqs 200 million line of credit 
through the exportimport bank 
the measure also requires the united states to vote against any 
loan sought by iraq from international institutions like the world 
bank 
it also would force any us exporter wishing to sell items to 
iraq to first prove that they will not be used to develop chemical 
or biological weapons or ballistic missiles or to enhance iraqs 
ability to support terrorism 
the bills author rep howard berman dcalif said the united 
states must register its disapproval of iraqs aggression 
the lesson of iraq is clear berman said you win nothing 
by appeasing a bully he merely becomes a bolder and more dangerous 
bully 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said late wednesday night that the iraqi offensive 
shows that dangers in that part of the world are becoming more 
than just dangers and actual war 
last week similar sanctions were added to the 1990 farm bill 
during house and senate floor consideration those sanctions 
included an end to us loan guarantees under which iraq now can 
buy up to 1 billion a year in agricultural commodities 
iraq had moved about 100000 troops to its border with kuwait 
after claiming that kuwaits production of oil beyond quotas of the 
opec cartel had depressed the world price thus diminishing iraqs 
revenue and that kuwait had been stealing oil from a field that 
straddles the border 
iraqi officials on wednesday walked out on talks in jiddah 
saudi arabia aimed at resolving the 2weekold crisis and 
complained that kuwait was not negotiating seriously 
iraq threatened to invade once before in 1961 after britain 
ended its protectorate over kuwait iraq then claimed kuwait as 
part of its territory but the appearance on the kuwaiti side of 
the border of troops from britain and other arab states deterred 
further action by iraq

congress responding to a spate of ethics 
scandals is taking its first step toward curtailing lawmakers 
money chase for campaign funds as senators also vote to quit 
accepting outside speaking fees 
the senates democratic majority overrode republican opposition 
wednesday night to approve the first change in federal election 
laws since congress voted 16 years ago to publicly finance and 
limit spending on presidential elections in wake of the watergate 
scandal 
on a 5940 largely partyline vote the senate approved a 
campaign finance bill to place similar limits on congressional 
candidates spending provide them with subsidies to buy television 
advertising and outlaw specialinterest political action committees 
we have a system out of control said sen david boren 
dokla the bills chief author the money chase has not slowed 
down 
house leaders hope to take up similar legislation friday before 
congress begins a fiveweek vacation but without the ban on 
political action committees or pacs that grew up after the 1974 
law 
such committees contributed nearly onefourth of the 185 
million spent on senate races and 45 percent of the money spent by 
house winners in the 1988 election 
outnumbered republicans vehemently opposed to spending ceilings 
and any form of public financing said president bush would veto 
the senate version 
but leaders in both parties expressed some hope that a spotlight 
on the fall election might force the white house into negotiations 
when lawmakers return in september 
the issue is going to get hotter hotter and hotter as we move 
toward november said boren if i were president i would want 
to find a compromise for the members in my party before the 
election 
boren said the bill contains several measures that bush said 
must be part of any reform package outlawing pacs an end to 
honoraria for speeches and a ban on incumbents use of franking 
privileges to mail newsletters at government expense to voters in 
election years 
nonetheless senate gop leader bob dole of kansas complained 
that the bill only reforms republicans by limiting how much 
money can be spent by candidates and their fundraising national 
and state party organizations where the gop excels 
untouched by the bill republicans complained is the millions 
of dollars in their members dues that unions spend on voter 
registration and turnout 90 percent of it in favor of democrats 
in my view the die is cast on this bill dole said it 
seems not possible but it may be possible yet to arrive at a bill 
a great majority could support maybe something will come out of 
all of this 
possible areas of compromise according to congressional 
sources include uncapping how much candidates could raise in small 
amounts from instate donors making unions disclose more of what 
they spend on politics and reducing the impact of pacs without 
outlawing them 
five republicans one of them just disciplined and another 
under investigation in ethics cases joined 54 democrats in favor 
of the bill the only democrat to oppose it was south carolina sen 
ernest hollings who argues that anything short of a constitutional 
amendment will fail to stem the influence of money in politics 
the republican supporters were sens john mccain of arizona 
james jeffords of vermont william cohen of maine david 
durenberger of minnesota and larry pressler of south dakota 
durenberger was denounced by his colleagues on a 960 vote last 
week for violating senate rules by skirting the current limits on 
honoraria through a book publishing deal 
mccain along with four democrats is among the keating 
five senators now under investigation by the senate ethics 
committee for interceding with savings and loan regulators on 
behalf of lincoln savings amp loan association 
the regulators now claim that the collapse of the thrift last 
year will cost taxpayers up to 2 billion its principal owner 
phoenix financier charles h keating jr had contributed a total 
of 13 billion to the five senators campaign efforts 
the bill aims to close loopholes in the 1974 law that allowed 
keating and other executives to bundle contributions from their 
employees and present them to candidates 
by limiting for the first time how much state parties can spend 
on elections it also would effectively stop the use of those 
organizations by wealthy contributors to funnel gifts in blocks of 
100000 to presidential campaigns 
both bush and democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis 
received millions of dollars in 1988 through such backdoor soft 
money contributions not subject to federal election commission 
reporting requirements

inspired by hollywood westerns many 
europeans want to come to wyoming and become cowboys most are plum 
out of luck pardner 
unless they have guaranteed job offers there is no home on the 
range for them 
news reports earlier this year about a shortage of experienced 
ranch hands whipped up a stampede of inquiries from wouldbe 
cowboys in east germany britain czechoslovakia australia and 
canada state and private agencies say 
steffaen petry 22 was one of two east germans to make his way 
to wyoming recently in search of ranch work 
from the time i was very little i wanted to be a cowboy he 
said through an interpreter last month from a little boy i knew 
about john wayne 
but both he and his countryman were turned down for lack of 
experience and work papers said oralia mercado executive director 
of mountain plains a casper organization that helps ranchers find 
experienced hands 
ive been getting a lot of calls mercado said tuesday 
initially it was five to 10 calls every half hour one whole 
day thats all i did 
foreigners looking for employment in the united states cannot 
get a work visa without an american sponsor and a guaranteed job 
offer and getting a offer to work as a ranch hand isnt easy for a 
european tenderfoot 
wyoming ranchers occasionally sponsor workers from mexico and 
peru where ranches are similar with lots of wide open space for 
grazingbut ranches in europe dont offer experience that is 
practical in wyoming mercado said 
germany does not have a lot of land where they graze 
animals she said they have lot of pastures and farms and that 
will not qualify them for the type of work we are dealing with 
petry spoke only one word of english cowboy when he 
arrived at the cheyenne airport in july with help from an airport 
maintenance worker and state officials he was taken in by rancher 
sloan hale who speaks german 
for several weeks petry pulled weeds and planted trees on 
hales ranch in cheyenne but hale needed no permanent help and 
petry had to leave the state 
petry had sold all his possessions to get to wyoming he was 
released last december from an east german prison after two years 
behind bars for trying to escape to the west 
not until i am a real cowboy after i work for a year as a 
cowboy will i wear a cowboy hat he said then i will be a 
real cowboy

key senators promise to question david h 
souter closely on controversial issues and the supreme court 
nominee says he will be ready to respond when his confirmation 
hearings begin next month 
as he made his getacquainted rounds on capitol hill the 
reserved federal judge from new hampshire said wednesday he is 
looking forward to the start of the hearings sept 13 he suggested 
that his appearance before the senate judiciary committee will end 
his string of no comments 
its going to destroy my reputation for not saying much he 
said 
sen edward kennedy dmass said he was favorably impressed 
after meeting souter 
but kennedy a leading liberal said souters apparent 
opposition to some forms of affirmative action concerns me and 
he indicated he would question him on the issue at the confirmation 
hearings 
those will be certainly matters that will be brought up 
kennedy said the judge knows there will be a full and complete 
hearing a wide variety of different areas that are going to be 
covered i think thats what the constitution requires 
in a 1976 commencement speech souter used the term 
affirmative discrimination in describing federal programs that 
give special preferences to minorities 
souter also visited sen howell heflin dala who said 
afterward the nominee told him he would be prepared to answer 
questions on the issue of the right of privacy 
i dont think you ought to ask him would you reverse roe vs 
wade the 1973 supreme court ruling that legalized abortion 
heflin said but i think you will find there are legitimate areas 
of inquiry that will be raised 
souter let others do the talking on the latest potentially 
controversial issue to surface a legal brief he submitted to the 
supreme court in a civil rights dispute 14 years ago 
souter was new hampshires attorney general in 1976 working for 
archconservative gov meldrim thomson when the state opposed a 
federal regulation requiring states to submit racial breakdowns of 
their employees 
the regulation proceeds from the cynical assumption that the 
fairest employer cannot be trusted any more than the most biased 
and it ends in treating every employer as if he were a suspected 
bigot and lawbreaker the brief said 
the equal employment opportunity commission rule requires states 
to submit a racial breakdown of employees as a means of assuring 
equal opportunity for minorities 
new hampshire was the only state that challenged the regulation 
the states position was defended wednesday by sen warren rudman 
rnh a leading supporter of souters nomination 
rudman said the eeoc case originated while he was new 
hampshires attorney general and continued under souter 
we felt strongly that the federal government had no right to 
impose those rules on sovereign states we didnt have a problem 
defending the state rudman said he added he still believes 
the federal government is guilty of unwarranted intrusion 
in the 1976 case a federal judge ordered new hampshire to abide 
by the eeoc rule the 1st us circuit court of appeals on which 
souter now sits upheld the judges ruling 
souter as state attorney general then asked the supreme court 
to declare the federal regulation unconstitutional 
the brief he signed said the rule requires states to become 
colorconscious rather than colorblind and could lead to racial 
quotas quotas are an impermissible end and accordingly so too 
should be the means to that end it said 
the brief also said the regulation violates the rights of each 
worker to be free from having his or her own skin color 
eyeballed recorded and reported

congressional democrats are warning president 
bush and republican leaders that fingerpointing over the budget 
stalemate will only jeopardize efforts to forge a deficitreduction 
agreement in september 
serious budget bargaining is on hold until congress returns from 
its monthlong august recess republicans promised on wednesday to 
spend the break telling the public that democrats had dragged the 
talks to a standstill by refusing to advance a proposal of their 
own 
well let the american people judge for themselves on this 
issue white house spokesman roman popadiuk said shortly after 
bush held a budget strategy session with 150 congressional 
republicans 
ill just explain to my people objectively that we produced 
a plan pursuant to an agreement we were ready to put it on the 
table but the democrats didnt said sen pete domenici of new 
mexico ranking republican on the senate budget committee 
democrats countered that with the two parties trying to develop 
a schedule for reaching a deal in september partisanship would not 
help 
if they launch a fullscale partisan attack theyre risking a 
longterm agreement for a very shortterm political gain said 
sen james sasser dtenn chairman of the senate budget committee 
this problem is much too serious to see who can make some 
clever accusation said sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of 
the senate finance committee 
the talks have barely budged during their 12 weeks even as the 
oct 1 start of the 1991 fiscal year has drawn closer 
the budget deficit for 1991 is projected at 169 billion not 
including the cost of rescuing the nations savings and loan 
industry the grammrudman deficitreduction law will impose 
devastating spending cuts of more than 100 billion in october 
unless a budget deal is reached 
but the bargaining ground to a halt after an administration 
proposal to save 54 billion was floated last week higher taxes on 
beer and wine and a limit on the deductions allowed for state and 
local income taxes were mentioned as revenue sources 
angry republicans have demanded that democrats produce a plan of 
their own unless a plan is produced bush promised to veto 
spending bills he considered too expensive and leave the 
grammrudman cuts intact 
but democrats have countered that with recess approaching a 
package announced now would simply draw criticism for a month and 
prove of little value 
the argument about laying down a plan right now frankly is 
more of an argument that says wed like to have democrats bleed a 
little bit because we bled said rep leon panetta dcalif 
chairman of the house budget committee 
negotiators said that when bargaining resumes in september they 
may seek a secluded retreat where they can do their work 
uninterrupted 
bentsen said a plantation on marylands eastern shore is a 
possibility participants said white house budget director richard 
darman wants the talks to proceed at camp david the presidential 
retreat in western maryland but democrats fear camp david would be 
too small to accommodate staff aides

a new usjapanese agreement resolves a 
contentious trade dispute over barriers that have blocked american 
and other foreign companies from the lucrative japanese 
telecommunications market 
us trade representative carla hills announced the accord late 
wednesday hailing it as an important step towards giving us 
firms in japan access comparable to the access japanese firms enjoy 
in the united states 
the settlement ended four months of bargaining over us demands 
for greater access to the japanese market 
negotiators had been holding marathon talks in tokyo over the 
past two weeks trying to meet a wednesday deadline had the 
discussions failed to resolve the dispute the united states could 
have retaliated by imposing higher tariffs on japanese products 
while the exact language of the agreement was still being 
reviewed by both sides us officials expressed satisfaction that 
their major demands had been met 
hills said the japanese had agreed to remove barriers blocking 
us companies from offering telephone services such as voice mail 
and electronic banking 
the agreement also removed barriers preventing the sale directly 
to customers of a type of telephone device known as network channel 
terminating equipment this device allows signals from business 
equipment such as computers to be transmitted over telephone lines 
the potential japanese market in the two areas was estimated to 
be more than 3 billion annually us companies hope to gain a 
significant portion of the market because of their wide lead in 
many telecommunications fields 
we are significantly ahead of the japanese in experience and 
efficiency in providing these services given the significant 
lowering of bureaucratic obstacles we are going to do pretty 
well said one us trade official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
both sides were negotiating under the aug 1 deadline set last 
march 30 for resolving the dispute 
without an agreement hills was authorized to begin a process 
that could have resulted in economic retaliation against japanese 
products sold in this country equal to the amount of estimated lost 
sales facing american firms 
telecommunications has been a major source of trade tension 
between the united states and japan the 1988 us trade act 
requires an annual review of all trade agreements in this area and 
allows for retaliation if the united states finds the japanese are 
not living up to prior agreements 
last year the united states threatened to impose tariffs on 
japanese imports unless the tokyo government changed regulations 
affecting the use of cellular telephones and some radio services 
offered by motorola inc 
the agreement on telecommunications equipment is the latest in a 
series of deals struck between the two nations in an effort to 
lower trade tensions earlier this year the japanese agreed to 
expand market access for us and other foreign companies in the 
areas of timber products satellites and super computers 
in addition the two nations reached agreement on a 
broadranging accord aimed at attacking structural barriers in both 
countries that have been targeted as a primary reason for the 49 
billion trade deficit the united states ran up with japan in 1989 
that represented nearly half the total us shortfall of 1094 
billion for the year

neil bush accused of conflict of interest as 
a savings and loan director continues to dispute key points raised 
by regulators in the case 
the presidents son was a director of silverado banking savings 
and loan association a denverbased thrift that failed in december 
1988 at a cost to taxpayers of 1 billion 
in two documents released wednesday by the office of thrift 
supervision bush and the regulators said they disagreed on a 
number of significant points the key point of contention is 
whether bush adequately disclosed to silverado his business 
relationships with kenneth m good and bill l walters two big 
borrowers from the thrift 
on monday the ots released a document setting out the areas of 
agreement between bush and the regulators 
all of the documents contain information that was previously 
made public they have been submitted to administrative law judge 
daniel j davidson as part of the proceeding in the bush case 
bush has been ordered to appear at a public hearing on sept 25 
in denver before davidson who will then make a recommendation to 
ots director timothy ryan 
in addition to the ots case the federal deposit insurance corp 
is considering filing a negligence lawsuit against bush and other 
silverado directors 
bushs attorneys and the ots each submitted one of the new 
documents called statements of contested facts in his sevenpage 
paper bush contended that before he joined the silverado board he 
disclosed his relationships with good and walters to former 
silverado chairman michael wise other silverado managers the 
board of directors and the thrifts attorneys 
good and walters invested millions of dollars in bushs oil 
partnership jnb exploration co which drilled several dry holes 
in wyoming over two years and failed to become profitable 
as a director of silverado bush voted to approve some loans to 
good and walters but did not vote on others 
bush also asserted in his document that he made no agreement to 
abstain from votes involving loans to good or walters 
in its ninepage submission the ots said there is no 
evidence that a letter prepared by wise about bushs business 
dealings with the two men was actually sent the letter was 
addressed to silverados preferred shareholders and was accompanied 
by a cover memo to the directors the ots noted 
the document alleged that bush breached his duty to silverado 
shareholders when he voted to approve certain loans to good and 
walters five of those loans resulted in a combined loss to 
silverado of at least 46 million the ots said 
generally accepted standards of prudent operation require the 
disclosure of a thrift directors relationships with major 
customers of the institution when further transactions are under 
consideration the agency said

a federal board is calling for immediate 
inspection of all boeing 737s and several other airliners after 
investigators determined that a mechanical fault not a bomb 
likely destroyed a philippine jet 
philippine authorities had said they suspected a bomb in the may 
11 explosion and fire that killed eight people as the philippines 
air lines 737 was taxiing for takeoff on a domestic flight from 
manila 
but the national transportation safety board which has assisted 
in the philippine governments inquiry said wednesday that 
investigators found evidence of a possibly defective switch inside 
the jetliners center fuel tank and damaged wiring leading to the 
switch 
the investigation has found no evidence of a bomb an 
incendiary device or sabotage ntsb chairman james kolstad said 
in a letter to federal aviation administration chief james busey 
the safety board has no power to issue orders for emergency 
inspections of airliners but the faa does foreign airlines 
generally follow faa orders involving usbuilt planes 
the fourmember board urged busey to issue airworthiness 
directives calling for inspection of float switch wiring in all 
boeing 737s and in all planes among other airliner types where 
modifications have been made that might have caused damage to wires 
leading to switches in the fuel tanks 
boeing co documents show that nearly 1900 of its 737s are in 
use worldwide the number of other airliners that could be affected 
was not immediately clear 
the faa already has advised philippine air lines to inspect its 
remaining two 737s for possible wiring damage during installation 
of lights that shine on each planes tail to illuminate its logo 
kolstad said but he said there is evidence of other wire damage in 
the plane that may have occurred at the factory 
the safety board does not believe that this action is adequate 
because it does not address the problem of faulty float switches 
kolstad added 
although kolstad said investigators have not determined exactly 
what triggered the explosion he said 
it is possible that the combination of a faulty float switch 
and damaged wires providing a continuous power supply to the float 
switch may have caused an electrical arc or overheating of the 
switch leading to the ignition of the center fuel tank vapor 
the board chairman said laboratory examination of the switch 
from the philippine jet indicated defects that show it is 
possible that the switch did not pass inspection when originally 
assembled 
the manufacturer revere aerospace changed its method of 
building the switches three years ago but all 850 switches stocked 
by boeing were made before the change kolstad said in the letter 
the board questioned boeings procedures for inspecting the 
switches and said a testing technique should be developed that 
would ensure that the switches are free from defect that could 
cause an explosion or fire 
boeing spokesman tom cole said the airplane manufacturer has 
been participating in the investigation he said it probably 
already has sent out a service letter to other 737 users on 
implications of the philippine explosion 
cole said however he knew of no recommendations boeing had 
made for inspections or alterations 
we are cooperating fully in the investigation and we are 
advising our customers of whatever we learn he said 
safety board member jim burnett in a comment attached to 
kolstads letter said he preferred an even broader inspection 
affecting any airliner with a revere aerospace switch of the type 
used in the philippine jet 
burnett also called for an order that all such switches be 
tested and replaced if found defective

business and civil rights forces vied in 
lastminute lobbying as the house neared a vote on legislation 
designed to combat job discrimination but which critics claim will 
create hiring quotas 
there has been a mounting lobbying effort rep henry j 
hyde rill said wednesday night anybody with any interest at 
all in this has been on the capitol hill the employer groups 
the civil rights community 
the house planned to vote this afternoon on the bill which is 
similar to legislation already approved by the senate 
it would effectively overturn five supreme court decisions last 
year on job discrimination and was advancing in defiance of 
administration threats of a presidential veto 
lawmakers expected the major showdown to come over an amendment 
sponsored by rep john lafalce dny that would eliminate a 
provision that critics say would lead to hiring quotas and cap 
court damages at 100000 
the administration and business groups have been pushing for the 
amendment while civil rights forces say it would wreck the bill 
major provisions of the bill range from a ban on racial 
harassment in the workplace to barriers against reopening 
courtapproved fairhiring agreements 
the most controversy centers on provisions that would make it 
easier to win hiring discrimination cases by showing statistical 
evidence of bias 
the administration says those features are so skewed against 
employers that companies would adopt hiring quotas out of fear that 
they otherwise would be bombarded with discrimination suits 
this week brought more intense debate over the unlimited damages 
that could be awarded to victims of intentional discrimination 
under the bill 
the lafalce plan provided for a cap on damages of 100000 for 
each complaint but they would be awarded only if no back pay was 
ordered as a result of the complaint 
administration officials and other critics said a cap was one of 
the features needed to prevent the bill from becoming a lawyers 
bonanza 
it will revitalize the trial lawyers association and terrorize 
employers into hiring by the numbers hyde said of the bill as 
written 
but sponsors said it would be unfair to women religious 
minorities and the disabled because unlimited damages already are 
allowed for racial and ethnic discrimination 
it would say to the world that america considers women 
secondclass citizens not deserving of the same rights as blacks 
and hispanics said rep don edwards dcalif 
lobbyists from both sides crisscrossed capitol hill throughout 
the week as the house vote neared businesses flew in scores of 
executives on tuesday to meet with homestate congressmen and urge 
a vote against the bill or at least in favor of amendments to 
temper its provisions 
the executives set up an informal headquarters and clearinghouse 
for information at the capitol hill club adjacent to republican 
national committee headquarters said lobbyists who asked not to be 
identified 
spearheading the lobbying on the other side was the leadership 
conference on civil rights whose member organizations range from 
major unions to the national association for the advancement of 
colored people 
conference representatives held several bargaining sessions with 
administration officials in an effort to reach compromise on the 
issue after president bush said he wanted to sign a bill to fight 
job discrimination but not one that would lead to hiring quotas 
but the two sides have not been able to reach an accord 
a business umbrella group called the fair employment coalition 
has been coordinating lobbying against the provisions it contends 
would bring on hiring quotas and allow excessive damages its 
members are senior human resources vice presidents of 140 major 
corporations

the house has approved 28 billion for a 
series of revamped housing programs by an overwhelming vote that 
could make moot a presidential veto threat 
the vote wednesday was 37843 
the bill includes most of the bush administrations initiative 
for encouraging lowincome housing tenants to purchase their homes 
as well as provisions sought by congressional housing advocates to 
offer rental assistance to help firsttime home buyers and to 
encourage construction of new rental housing 
house republicans joined democrats in supporting the bill but 
key republicans said they were doing so in hopes the bill would be 
changed when it goes to house and senate conferees to work out 
differences in the two chambers versions 
rep chalmers wylie rohio ranking republican on the banking 
finance and urban affairs committee said president bush and jack 
kemp the secretary of housing and urban development got 90 
percent of their proposal to encourage public housing residents to 
purchase their homes in some cases 
the senate has already approved a more modest housing bill after 
reaching agreement with the bush administration on key provisions 
the white house threatened a veto because the house version 
disregards the administrations demand for changes in the federal 
housing administration including a requirement for a larger down 
payment on fhabacked home mortgages 
the senate version includes the higher down payment requirements

the crew of a cargo ship broken by 30foot waves 
kicked up by hurricane bertha abandoned ship in churning chilly 
seas because the vessels lifeboats were too shabby to use the 
coast guard said today 
six crew members of the freighter corazon drowned after the 
ships keel snapped about 350 miles off cape cod twentyone others 
were rescued by commercial ships providing lifeboats and rafts the 
coast guard said 
coast guard lt cmdr paul milligan said the corazons own 
lifeboats were unserviceable 
the coast guard is investigating the ships lifeboats said 
quartermaster 1st class matthew giltner 
the crew abandoned the 593foot malteseregistered freighter in 
90 mph winds early wednesday about 11 hours after reporting the 
ship was breaking up 
soviet hong kong and norwegian merchant ships steamed to the 
stricken vessel as us military aircraft coordinated the rescue 
effort from above 
we have accounted for everybody 20 in good condition one 
alive but injured six deceased milligan said three bodies were 
recovered 
the search for the other victims all seen dead in the water 
was halted late wedneseday because of rough seas and bad weather 
the hurricane which was blamed for a florida swimmers death 
tuesday moved northeast today and weakened slightly after injuring 
six people in nova scotia with high seas on wednesday 
the corazon was carrying about 25000 tons of cement from greece 
to new york and the load probably contributed to its damage said 
coast guard lt rodney gadsden 
rescue efforts did not go easily at one point in the morning

health officials are employing 
psychological warfare in a nearly decadelong battle against 
thousands of noisy starlings that descend in dense flocks each 
summer in certain elmlined neighborhoods 
the birds keep people awake coat cars in messy droppings and 
make bob mathis life miserable each summer 
mathis the villages environmental health supervisor has tried 
everything over the years from wind machines to huge balloons 
painted with terror eyes to resemble owls 
he had limited success until he hit on a promising combination 
two or three years ago of highintensity search lights and a taped 
starling distress call that fills the evening air with screeching 
to scare away the birds 
we use a physical assault and psychological warfare he 
said the lights unsettle their environment and the starling 
distress call is an eerie sound like a bird being strangled 
for seven years or more in the warmer months the birds in 
flocks of 3000 to 5000 seem to favor the cathedralarch canopies 
of elms on two usually quiet blocks in this chicago suburb 
the birds feast on beetles and caterpillars by day and head for 
the trees at dusk for their evening shuteye 
residents call the kids inside and park their cars down the 
block away from the splatter of bird droppings 
its a real mess here one resident ken radnitzer said 
wednesday night during one of mathis regular trips to the 
neighborhood with the lights and distress call 
its a health hazard said another kathleen dawson the 
droppings get so bad that if youre out in the evening and your kid 
is in bare feet youre forever running after him or in the back 
yard the droppings get on the toys 
john jones said he doesnt need an alarm clock in the summer 
at 4 5 6 oclock in the morning the birds start up he 
said theyll take care of waking you up 
when the village first went after the birds it suspended 
balloons 6 feet around above trees the balloons had reflective 
terror eyes stuck on but the balloons blew away in wind storms 
and the approach was abandoned 
wind machines were tried with little success ultimately 
mathis who doesnt want to kill the birds or tamper with the 
trees settled on the lights and taped screeches 
the method chases the birds off the blocks under siege but they 
come back eventually or bother some other block but mathis isnt 
ready to give up on the technique 
you just have to be persistent he said its a question 
of who can last the longest and the health department so far is 
keeping up with the birds 
starlings native to europe were first released in new yorks 
central park in 1890 two earlier attempts to introduce the birds 
to north america failed but this one succeeded in a big way 
like the settlers before them the starlings headed west and 
reached the pacific in 60 years now they occupy nearly every nook 
and cranny of north america numbering an estimated 200 million

three mile islands unit 2 nuclear reactor 
only functioned for four months but customers would be paying for 
the nowcrippled unit until the year 2014 under a plan proposed by 
the plants owners 
in a report filed with the nuclear regulatory commission the 
owners representative said they intended to seek permission from 
state utility regulators to charge ratepayers 1956 million to 
dispose of unit 2 the money would be collected over the next 24 
years 
the unit operated only about four months before it was 
permanently disabled in the nations worst commercial nuclear 
accident on march 31 1979 its twin unit 1 was unharmed and was 
given permission to resume operations in 1985 the owners hope to 
operate the healthy unit until 2014 
the 1956 million is about 70 million more than the usual cost 
of decommissioning a comparable reactor that did not suffer an 
accident 
it is standard practice for utilities to ask ratepayers to fund 
decommissioning the formal term for mothballing or dismantling a 
plant at the end of its energyproducing life 
but three mile island poses a more difficult question 
pennsylvania consumer advocate irwin popowsky said

if you lose your job because the federal 
government wants to protect the spotted owl or cut defense 
spending does the government have any special obligation to you 
that is the question generating increasing debate on capitol 
hill with the fall election approaching supporters of clean air 
protected forests and reduced defense spending are displaying a 
heightened awareness that their actions have an economic impact 
lawmakers debated legislation wednesday that is designed to 
provide extra support to loggers who lose their jobs because of 
protection of the spotted owl soldiers and defense factory workers 
victimized by defense cuts and coal miners laid off because of 
tougher air pollution laws and a corresponding decline in coal 
burning 
the fiveyear 5 billion program is the brainchild of reps 
thomas downey dny and pete stark dcalif whose districts 
are among the scores that could be heavily impacted by cuts in 
defense spending not surprisingly democrats from timber and coal 
mining states also signed on 
the downeystark proposal would provide extra unemployment and 
health benefits to about 200000 workers far fewer downey noted 
than the number expected to be displaced

so far 1990 is just an average year for 
earthquakes although the iranian quake in june was the deadliest 
in 14 years 
the us geological survey said wednesday the death toll in 
iran estimated at 50000 or more is the highest since a 1976 
quake in china killed more than 250000 people 
overall there were 34 significant quakes in the first six 
months of 1990 that would be close to normal since there are on 
average 60 significant quakes in a typical year the agency said 
a significant quake is defined as one reaching 65 or higher on 
the richter scale or a lesser temblor causing significant 
casualties or damage 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released in an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph 
every increase of one whole number say from 55 to 65 
indicates a tenfold increase in ground motion 
the quake that struck iran measured 77 on the scale according

kuwait were led by the elite republican guard that did the brunt 
of the fighting in the 198088 war with iran the troops set up 
roadblocks at major intersections in the capital 
the invaders surrounded the palace of the ruler of kuwait sheik 
jaber alahmed alsabah the official said residents in the 
palaces vicinity said it was seized after two hours of heavy 
artillery barrages

thousands of residents attempted to flee south toward saudi 
arabia in their cars kuwaits official radio broadcast a desperate 
plea for help from other arab nations 
the kuwaiti embassy in washington reported only that there were 
many casualties in the fighting which follows a flareup in a 
protracted dispute over a border oil field but gave no numbers

the iraqi action was expected to dominate talks between 
president bush and prime minister margaret thatcher when they meet 
later thursday in aspen colo 
iraqi officials on wednesday had abruptly walked out on talks in 
jiddah saudi arabia complaining that the kuwaiti representatives 
were not negotiating seriously president hosni mubarak of egypt

free kuwait and decided to cooperate with it the iraqi statement 
said 
it said the troops no numbers were given were in kuwait to 
defend the revolution and the kuwaiti people there was no further 
identification of the revolutionary government 
iraq warned too that any foreign troops trying to interfere with 
its actions would be attacked 
more than 60 percent of the countrys 18 million residents are 
foreigners

artillery in a failed attempt to repulse them government officials 
contacted by telephone earlier thursday said 
iraqi which is the size of california has an estimated 1 
million troops among its 17 million populace compared to 20300 
members of the kuwait armed forces 
in baghdad the official radio interspersed martial music with 
songs with slogans like greetings to the revolution in kuwait 
the invasion followed massive troop movements to the south on 
wednesday 
in kuwait early thursday the rattle of automatic guns sounded 
and explosions in rapid succession shook local residents from their 
sleep and the kuwaiti cabinet quickly assembled 
residents in downtown kuwait reported formations of frenchmade 
mirage jet fighters of the kuwaiti air force taking to the skies in 
the direction of the border region 
the streets were empty some people on rooftops of their houses 
reported hearing gunblasts growing in intensity and speed moments 
later army tanks and armored personnel carriers were moving in the 
direction of the royal palace apparently to reinforce the guards

mandatory sentence of life in prison on each of four murder counts 
and one count of attempted murder the terms will be served 
concurrently 
in imposing sentence the judge said delisle intentionally drove 
the car into the water but may not have been guilty of firstdegree 
murder and might have benefited had the trial been moved out of 
town away from heavy publicity 
the judge had denied a defense request for a change of venue 
killed when the car sank in 27 feet of water were delisles 
children bryan 8 melissa 4 kathryn 2 and emily 8 months

atlantas roman catholic archbishop resigned last 
month for fear a twoyear relationship with a woman half his age 
would become public his temporary successor says 
eugene a marino the nations first black archbishop had cited 
health reasons and the need for spiritual renewal psychological 
therapy and medical supervision when he resigned july 10 he had 
relinquished his duties in may because of stress and a near heart 
attack 
but on wednesday bishop james p lyke said marino asked him to 
confirm the relationship with a 26yearold lay minister after a 
report earlier in the day by wagatv 
the tv station said that marino 56 was supporting vicki r 
long with 1500amonth payments and helping her buy a house it 
said a flight insurance policy taken by marino for a trip to mexico 
listed ms long as his beneficiary 
neither the tv station nor lyke said if the relationship was 
sexual 
lyke said the archbishop resigned because i think he probably 
realized that this was not going to be something that was going to 
stay out of the public eye my sense is that he concluded that he 
could not function with that kind of possible disclosure over his 
head 
ms long who filed a 23 million paternity suit in 1987 
against a priest she alleged fathered her child refused to comment 
on the allegations involving marino 
church officials refused to say where marino could be located 
the rev peter dora of the atlanta archdiocese said church 
officials would hold a news conference this afternoon 
ms long charged that the rev donal keohane of columbus ga 
fathered her daughter who was born in 1986 the church is paying 
child support but denies keohane fathered the child blood tests 
concluded he was not the father 
church faithful in atlanta reacted with disbelief 
this is a bombshell an i hate very much to hear this story 
said hugh spalding jr 
katherine woodyard former director of the archdiocesan 
commission for black catholic concern said as far as i know 
hes sick thats what they told us and thats what i believe 
marino was ordained in 1962 and consecrated as a bishop in 1974 
he had been the archbishop of atlanta since may 1988 coming from 
washington where he was auxiliary bishop to cardinal james hickey 
the pope appointed lyke auxiliary bishop of cleveland to run 
the archdiocese until a new archbishop is appointed the 
archdiocese covers 69 northern georgia counties with more than 
150000 roman catholics

the parents of a young woman who died from a 
backalley abortion are joining forces with a national womens 
rights group to overturn state laws requiring minors to get 
parental consent for abortions 
karen and bill bell of indianapolis appeared wednesday with the 
feminist majority at a news conference announcing the becky bell 
campaign which the group plans to take to high schools and 
college campuses around the country 
the bells 17yearold daughter becky died in 1988 from a 
massive infection after receiving an abortion from an unqualified 
practitioner 
the bells said they had a good relationship with their daughter 
and had openly discussed sex and birth control they said that 
although they had never talked about abortion with becky they 
would have left the decision up to her but her father said becky 
confided to a friend i cant tell mom and dad i love them too 
much 
the parental consent law sounds wonderful mrs bell said 
what parent wouldnt want to know i would id say my girl 
will tell me because she tells me everything becky told me every 
single thing she did until she fell in love 
beckys story is the subject of a halfhour video abortion 
denied shattering young womens lives that the feminist 
majority plans to take to schools throughout the country 
this is one of the toughest areas for us in public opinion 
this is one of the reasons we decided to launch this major 
campaign said eleanor smeal president of the feminist majority 
a lot of people just kneejerk think well sure parents should 
be involved they do not realize what mandatory intrusive 
compulsory laws do to hurt women and their families 
in june the supreme court upheld laws in ohio and minnesota 
requiring a minor to obtain parental consent for an abortion 
fourteen states currently enforce such laws 
indiana allows minors to get a judges permission to waive the 
parental consent restrictions but the bells said their daughter 
had heard that the only sitting judge in indianapolis was opposed 
to abortion and granted few waivers 
in the video several young women who sought judicial waivers 
were interviewed they described the process as intimidating 
everyone knows what youre sitting there for said one young 
woman in some states it takes up to 22 days for a waiver to be 
granted 
the campaign hopes to recruit as many as 1 million young people 
from college campuses and high schools to join becky bell 
brigades 
we will be asking young people to help us with voter 
registration drives with petition campaigns with going 
doortodoor said smeal oregon massachusetts and texas have 
been targeted as key states where parental consent legislation is 
pending 
the states that currently enforce parental consent or 
notification laws are alabama arkansas indiana louisiana 
massachusetts minnesota missouri north dakota ohio rhode 
island south carolina utah west virginia wyoming

after the free lunch is over will the 
sharks know its time to go home 
the 80000 columbia riverpacific ocean shark tournament 
featuring a top prize of 35000 prompted a lawsuit wednesday from 
a surf shop manager who says its too risky to lure the ocean 
predators into areas frequented by beachgoers 
competitors plan to chum or toss ground fish and blood into the 
water to attract sharks said ron miller a charter boat operator 
and tournament organizer 
who will tell the sharks that have been lured in from many 
many miles away that its time to go home now seaside resident 
susanna hendrix wrote in a protest letter to various state agencies 
steve mckenzie manager of the cleanline surf shop in seaside 
said in the lawsuit slated for a hearing today that the hunt which 
is expected to draw 200 charter boats this weekend jeopardizes 
public safety 
the lifeguards say the possibility of a shark attack on the 
beach in seaside is very real mckenzie said 
aside from the safety issue mckenzie said the tournament off 
oregons northern coast should be stopped because it is inhumane 
the idea of attracting sharks by throwing animal blood into 
the water and then pulling them on board clubbing them to death 
holding them weighing them and then throwing them in the landfill 
thats offensive he said it is killing for the sake of 
killing 
miller of long beach wash said the danger of shark attacks 
was remote because the tournament will take place up to five miles 
offshore 
there are literally millions of sharks out there miller 
said as far as shark tournaments they are held on the east 
coast all the time and there has never been any kind of injury 
attributed to a tournament 
if anything this tournament will elevate the status of the 
shark to a more prized food fish and a more prized sport fish he 
said

wednesdays 14665yen close it opened at 14713 yen and ranged 
between 14650 yen and 14900 yen 
currency dealers said news late in the morning that iraqi troops 
had crossed the border into kuwait set off sharp dollar buying 
the dollar was bought briskly and quickly when the news came 
of the iraqi troop movement said masakazu kimura a dealer with 
daiichi kangyo bank 
the dollar tends to rise in times of world unrest because it is 
regarded as a safe haven 
about 1856 billion changed hands in spot trading up from 
wednesdays 1355 billion 
the invasion came after negotiations between iraq and kuwait 
collapsed wednesday in their dispute over oil borders and money 
bank of tokyo trader masafumi koyama said fears of higher oil 
prices and uncertainties over the iraqkuwait dispute accelerated 
the dollar buying in the afternoon 
investors generally tend to overreact to any news from the 
middle east but now they are waiting to see the reaction from the 
european and us markets after we close koyama said he said 
the iraqkuwait situation had reversed the dollars recent 
downtrend in which the us currency lost 41 yen in tokyo between 
monday and wednesday 
the dollar will quickly surpass the 151yen line if 
participants remain uncertain about the situation koyama added 
strife in the middle east also drove up bids for crude oil as 
tokyo traders reported the marker price for north sea oil brent 
crude was bid up to 2130 a barrel about 30 to 40 cents higher 
than in new york late wednesday no sellers were reported however 
on the stock exchange the 225share nikkei stock average lost 
59281 points or 192 percent ending the day at 3024518 the 
index which lost 19767 points on wednesday dropped more than 700 
points by midafternoon as panicked participants dumped issues 
after reports of the iraqi action traders said 
yoshio ogawa chief trader at nikko securities co said 
arbitrage selling of spot issues to take profits from price gaps 
between the spot and future markets as well as the plunge in yen 
and bond prices prompted the indexs afternoon dive 
although the nikkei reduced its losses toward the end of the 
afternoon session as participants calmed down and began picking up 
underpriced issues ogawa said the nikkei was likely to continue to 
suffer from uncertainties linked to the dispute between the two 
middle east nations

others called for blacks to take an active leadership role 
we have to begin to give ourselves an economic base from which 
our community can draw said keenan ivory wayans producer and 
star of the acclaimed tv series in living color 
other panelists said black critics tv viewers and moviegoers 
need to support works produced by or geared to blacks 
the sag study found that men were given more than twice as many 
roles as women in 1989 movies and men received 65 percent of all 
parts in television programs during the year 
the statistics were presented by meryl streep to launch sags 
first national womens conference she called the report tragic and 
stunning 
if the hollywood employment trend continues miss streep said 
by the year 2000 we will have 13 percent of roles and in 20 
years we will be eliminated from the movies 
miss streep said a growing number of movie roles going to women 
cast them as prostitutes rape victims and needy companions to 
domineering men she said the perception that women dont go to 
movies and therefore dont need films aimed at them is flawed 
miss streep said women are staying home precisely because there 
arent films catering to their interests and tastes 
mike medavoy chairman of tristar pictures said movie 
companies are just trying to produce popular fare 
i dont think the studios determine what peoples tastes 
are he said the tastes dictate what gets done 
three years ago according to the sag report actresses claimed 
a third of all film roles in 1989 they took 29 percent of all 
movie parts also in 1989 41 percent of all film roles were for 
male supporting actors and female leading roles made up only 14 
percent of the total 
jeffrey katzenberg chairman of walt disney studios said 
employment for women at disney is fairer than the study suggests 
were trying as hard as we can katzenberg said were 
putting them to work

iraq and kuwait produce onefifth of the 
total oil produced by the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries and their oil accounts for an estimated 5 percent of 
daily us consumption 
iraq is one of the major producers of the 13member oil cartel 
with a daily opec production quota of 314 million barrels that 
equals iran quota and is second only to saudi arabias quota of 
51 million barrels 
kuwaits quota is 15 million barrels per day out of an 
estimated production capacity of 22 million to 25 million barrels 
per day 
the united states buys about 200000 barrels of oil daily from 
kuwait and 500000600000 barrels from iraq 
in the first six months of this year the united states imported 
499 percent of its oil it produced 73 million barrels a day the 
lowest level in 29 years according to the american petroleum 
institute 
in the first half of 1990 opec produced about 235 million 
barrels of crude oil per day according to the nicosiabased 
industry newsletter the middle east economic survey world 
production outside the soviet union and its former satellites was 
about 52 million barrels daily 
kuwait is the only opec member to have developed an integrated 
international system covering both production and distribution of 
oil the latter is done through a network of gas stations in europe 
and elsewhere in partnership with leading oil companies 
kuwaits huge oil reserves are backed by one of the largest 
financial reserves in the world 
kuwait has more than 100 billion in surplus petrodollars 
mostly invested in the united states britain west germany france 
and other industrialized countries

the soviet union wants to launch 
unmanned rockets from florida under a policy awaiting president 
bushs approval 
bush is expected to act soon on guidelines which would allow 
foreign countries to send up rockets from the united states 
the soviets are interested in launching proton rockets from cape 
canaveral air force station next to nasas kennedy space center 
the center is much nearer the equator than the soviets launch 
site making it easier to put satellites into the most commonly 
used orbit above the equator 
the soviets wont make a formal request until the guidelines are 
final said william wirin executive vice president of space 
commerce corp a houston company that markets soviet rockets 
outside the soviet union 
space commerce recently relayed an informal request to the 
spaceport florida authority a state agency formed last year to 
support us commercial space ventures 
american launch companies fear their businesses will be 
jeopardized if american commercial payloads such as satellites are 
allowed to ride on soviet rockets 
this is not something we consider our mission by any means 
said ed ellegood the spaceport authoritys operations manager he 
said officials will not discuss the soviet proposal until a formal 
request is made 
the soviet union also is considering launch sites in australia 
and brazil

kuwait is a small kingdom whose fabulous 
riches have sometimes made it the envy of the muchlarger neighbors 
that surround it 
baghdad has long claimed that the 6880squaremile kuwait is 
part of iraq although kuwait has been ruled by the alsabah family 
as an emirate since 1756 
kuwaits relatively freewheeling newspapers are read throughout 
the arab world and kuwait has long been a major donor of economic 
aid to poorer countries inside and outside the arab world 
recently prodemocracy activists mounted a campaign for 
restoration of the countrys parliament which had been suspended 
in 1986 after fierce attacks on the government by opposition 
deputies 
the emir sheik jaber alahmed alsabah later introduced an 
interim national council with 50 elected members and 25 appointed 
charged with paving the way for restoration of a full parliament 
kuwaits oil tanker fleet was a frequent target of iranian 
attacks during the eightyear iraniraq war and iranian missiles 
were sent into kuwait at the height of the hostilities 
shiite moslem terrorists backed by iran launched repeated 
attacks in kuwait during the war including the successful bombings 
of the french and american embassies and an abortive attempt to 
kill the emir 
the kuwaitis are an ancient seafaring people but more than half 
the population of 18 million are foreigners mainly arab 
including 300000 palestinians 
most kuwaitis are sunni moslem but 30 percent adhere to the 
rival shiite sect shiites of iranian descent number nearly 
150000 the alsabah clan has ruled kuwait as an emirate since 
they settled there in the 18th century after trekking from the 
arabian hinterland 
kuwait lives on its oil revenue reached 30 billion in 1983 but 
has been declining since because of a drop in oil prices and 
production curbs 
kuwait currently produces about 15 million barrels of oil a day 
and has reserves of 897 billion barrels 128 percent of world 
reserves and enough to last for more than 250 years 
little grows in the desert climate so the emirate has to import 
nearly all its food 
the mongols arab caliphs and ottomans were by turn overlords of 
the bleak and largely unpopulated land until 1899 when the british 
became the dominant power in the region kuwait gained its 
independence in 1961

a judge who ruled los angeles countys board 
of supervisors had illegally drawn its districts to keep hispanics 
from getting elected rejected as nonsensical a plan offered by the 
board to solve the problem 
us district judge david kenyon on wednesday called for a new 
plan raising the prospect of a radical shift in the countys 
balance of power 
kenyon said the remedy offered by the board was a nonsensical 
distortion of existing supervisorial districts a calloused 
interpretation of the voting rights act and is insensitive to the 
needs of hispanic and black residents 
the judge set a hearing for today to consider alternative plans 
from civil rights groups and the us justice department 
civil rights groups and the department had sued in 1988 
accusing the supervisors of deliberately spreading the hispanic 
population across several districts when they changed voting 
boundaries after the 1980 census 
though hispanics make up about 35 percent of the countys 87 
million residents the fivemember board has not had an elected 
hispanic member in 115 years 
on june 7 kenyon ruled against the supervisors concluding they 
violated the voting rights act 
the boards conservatives responded by drafting a plan that 
created a hispanic majority in one liberal board members district 
while also preserving the boards conservative majority it was 
this plan kenyon rejected wednesday 
the next redistricting plans to be submitted by the american 
civil liberties union the government and a mexicanamerican group 
could greatly increase hispanic political clout and overturn the 
conservative majority 
that could have profound implications for funding in such areas 
as health and social services 
conservative supervisor mike antonovich denounced the judges 
decision and said he will appeal

medical evidence showing that a teenager 
fatally shot in the back by police had his hands raised in 
surrender when the officer opened fire prompted the states top 
prosecutor to reopen the case lawyers said 
police said phillip pannell 16 had a gun and was reaching for 
it when officer gary spath shot him in april a discredited 
coroners report supported the story told by spath and partner 
officer wayne blanco 
attorney general robert del tufo on tuesday rejected the autopsy 
findings of bergen county medical examiner dr lawrence j denson 
and ordered a new grand jury investigation 
the errors included faulty forensic study and inaccurate 
autopsy analysis both of which led to an incorrect conclusion 
concerning the possible actions of mr pannell at the time he was 
shot del tufo said in a statement 
the first grand jury to investigate the case deadlocked without 
indicting either officer 
del tufo declined to detail the nature of the mistakes but a 
former lawyer for the pannell family and the attorney representing 
blanco said the state is studying whether the victim had his hands 
raised when he was shot 
an independent autopsy performed by dr howard adelman who was 
hired by the pannell family found that the boys hands were held 
high overhead said former family lawyer franklin wilks 
joseph t afflito who represents blanco he was told last week 
that del tufos office had new forensic evidence that suggested 
the boy might have had his hands up 
the location of the bullet hole in pannells coat in relation to 
his body wound indicated his hands were up and damage to his rib 
cage and upper torso muscles supported that conclusion wilks said 
citing adelmans findings 
afflito said state prosecutors offered blanco a chance to give 
new testimony this week blanco declined because he had already 
told the truth the lawyer said 
spath has been suspended with pay blanco has not been 
disciplined 
attorney robert galantucci who represents spath condemned del 
tufos call for a new investigation 
they shouldnt be playing politics with the grand jury 
system he said 
del tufo said denson admitted his mistake denson and adelman 
could not be reached for comment wednesday 
the shooting sparked a night of racial unrest in this new york 
city suburb and local black leaders praised del tufos rejection of 
the autopsy report 
the truth has now come out activists said in a statement 
wednesday the new grand jury will learn about this new evidence 
and we are confident spath will be indicted 
five organizations including the national association for the 
advancement of colored people and the rainbow coalition issued the 
statement at a news conference 
the attorney generals office has been given one more chance 
i urge them to make good use of it said raymond m brown the 
pannells current attorney 
pannell of river edge was shot after running from police who 
were responding to a call about a youth brandishing a gun after 
the shooting police said they found in pannells clothing an 
athletic starter pistol that had been modified to fire live 
ammunition

iraqi president saddam husseins powerful army 
overran this small oilrich kingdom before dawn today and tankled 
troops quickly seized the rulers palace and other government 
buildings kuwaiti officials said 
iraq said it had come to the aid of revolutionary youth in 
kuwait who had toppled the government and set up a new 
administration 
the kuwaiti ruler whose palace was bombed by iraqi jet 
fighters reportedly fled to neighboring saudi arabia 
casualties in the blitz were reported heavy and the shelling 
fierce but no figures were immediately available 
the invasion came hours after iraq abruptly broke off talks on a 
disputed border oil field iraq also was demanding billions of 
dollars for oil kuwait pumped out of the field and the writeoff of 
billions in loans 
the iraqis have occupied all of kuwait a kuwaiti official 
shouted in a telephone interview from kuwait city just hours after 
thousands of iraqi troops and hundreds of tanks stormed across the 
border 75 miles away 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said iraqi 
forces seized all administrative buildings including the 
information ministry which houses the staterun radio and 
television stations 
the iraqi invasion was the first time in modern history that an 
arab nation has moved troops over the border of another arab state 
to take control 
saddam iraqs totalitarian leader has long harbored ambitions 
to lead the arab world and has committed his countrys vast oil 
wealth to building an arsenal that could achieve that end 
the palace of the countrys ruler sheik jaber alahmed 
alsabah was seized after two hours of heavy artillery and jet 
fighter attacks 
diplomatic sources in saudi arabia said the emir and his brother 
fled to saudi arabia early today the sources would not say how the 
two got there the alsabah family has ruled kuwait for nearly 250 
years 
witnesses said the bombardment of ports and airports was 
vicious thousands of residents attempted to flee south toward 
saudi arabia in their cars 
in washington the bush administration condemned the invasion 
and froze all iraq property in the united states and other areas 
under us control it also froze kuwait property under us 
jurisdiction to keep iraq from seizing it 
in new york the un security council swiftly condemned the 
invasion and demanded an unconditional withdrawal of iraqi troops 
iraqi first threatened military action against its former ally 
kuwait two weeks ago and six us warships began conducting 
exercises 600 miles to the southeast in the persian gulf on july 24 
cnn reported without attribution that a battle group led by the 
carrier uss independence was en route to the persian gulf from the 
indian ocean 
secretary of state james a baker iii in siberia for talks with 
eduard a shevardnadze asked the soviet foreign minister to 
immediately cease soviet arms deliveries to iraq baker then flew 
to mongolia and us officials said privately that he would cut 
short his visit there 
iraqi troops set up roadblocks at major intersections in the 
capital and on the main thoroughfare fahd salem street where they 
were seen forcing drivers out of their cars and ripping phones out 
of the vehicles 
cars that did not stop were shot at 
more than 60 percent of the countrys 18 million residents are 
foreigners 
diplomats said about 350 iraqi tanks wheeled into the kuwaiti 
capital a few hours after crossing the border 40 miles away 
the kuwaiti embassy in washington said casualties were high but 
gave no numbers residents said about 50 tanks were around the 
emirs palace and the neighboring us embassy the embassy did no 
answer its telephones 
the white house said it had no reports of harm to the estimated 
3800 americans in kuwait

iraqs invasion of kuwait is the latest 
thrust for ambitious president saddam hussein 
saddam earlier this year threatened to destroy half of israel 
with internationally outlawed chemical weapons if israel tried to 
attack any iraqi military facilities 
western nations are nervous about iraqs military posturing 
police have arrested several people in britain on charges they 
were trying to smuggle nuclearbomb triggers to baghdad 
police in britain and other european countries also intercepted 
shipments that they said were parts of a gigantic gun capable of 
firing chemical or nuclear shells into israel 250 miles west of 
the iraqi border 
seeking to don the arab nationalist mantle of the late egyptian 
president gamal abdel nasser saddam has acquired a reputation for 
ruthlessness 
obsessed about security he ordered the march 15 execution of 
iranianborn londonbased journalist farzad bazoft who had tried 
to gather information about a huge explosion at a 
militaryindustrial complex 
iraq has the secondlargest known oil reserves in the world 
after saudi arabia more than 100 billion barrels 
using oil revenue and his absolute power saddam initiated 
ambitious social educational and economic development programs in 
the 1970s 
his eightyear war with iran left him with the arab worlds most 
formidable and battletrained army but his nation was also saddled 
with about 70 billion in war debts of which 10 billion to 20 
billion was owed to kuwait saddam had demanded that kuwait write 
off that debt 
saddam launched an economic reconstruction drive after the 
august 1988 ceasefire with iran but was constantly strapped for 
cash 
he turned his attention to kuwait whose roaring oil production 
was helping glut the market and drive prices down cutting saddams 
precious revenues 
iraq claimed kuwait was stealing oil from a border oil field and 
demanded kuwaits bubiyan island which is opposite iraqs only 
outlets to the sea 
baghdad has even claimed for years that kuwait is part of iraq 
a majority of iraqs 16 million people are shiite moslems the 
same branch of islam as most iranians who the iraqis were at war 
with between 1980 and 1988 but iraq is ruled by sunni moslems 
there are small christian communities and an enclave in the 
north where most of the countrys rebellious 35 million kurds live 
captured by britain in 1916 iraq became independent in 1932 a 
military coup in 1958 ended the monarchy saddam came to power in 
1979 and gradually tightened the grip of his ruling baath socialist 
party

the british embassy was hit by shellfire and the sheraton and 
hilton hotels evacuated their clientele sources said 
swiss charge daffaires franco bessoni said on french radio that 
the palace was taken after bombardment by iraqi mig jet fighters 
you can see black smoke over there no one dares to go 
out you can hear gunfire the entire foreign community is staying 
indoors he said 
its chaos military jets are flying over all the time kathy 
mcgregor a canadian said by telephone at about midday she said 
she could still hear artillery fire 
the air space over kuwait was closed with airliners turned 
away iraq also sealed its own borders and airspace 
iraq said in a statement that it had responded to the request 
from interim government of free kuwait and decided to cooperate 
with it 
it said its troops no numbers were given were in kuwait to 
defend the revolution and the kuwaiti people there was no further 
identification of the revolutionary government 
saddams ruling council also warned that any foreign troops 
trying to interfere with its actions would be attacked 
kuwaiti forces had engaged the iraqi invaders with heavy 
artillery in their failed attempt to repulse them kuwaiti 
officials said earlier 
the invaders were led by the elite republican guard that did the 
brunt of the fighting in the 198088 war with iran iraq has an 
estimated 1 million troops including reservists among its 16 
million people compared to 20300 troops in kuwait 
iraqi radio said 15 army divisions were being recalled and 
ordered all men born between 1960 and 1966 to report to the army 
within three days 
todays fighting quickly sent oil prices surging in 
international markets the price of north sea brent crude for 
september delivery was quoted early today at 2230 a barrel 
against wednesdays london close of 2040 
iraq the worlds secondlargest oil producer had demanded 
higher oil prices at last months opec oil cartel meeting in geneva 
saddam had threatened military action against kuwait and the 
united arab emirates for exceeding their cartel production quotas 
and driving crude prices down opec agreed to cut output to boost 
prices 
the invasion came a day after talks between kuwait and iraq 
collapsed in jiddah saudi arabia kuwait had apparently refused to 
bend to iraqi demands 
the crisis began july 17 when saddam accused kuwait of trying to 
wreck the debtridden iraqi economy with oil overproduction and 
began massing troops on kuwaits border he also accused kuwait of 
stealing 24 billion in oil drilled from the border oil field 
rumailah 
iraq also demanded the kuwaiti island of bubiyan which is 
opposite iraqs only outlets to the persian gulf 
iraq which reportedly massed about 100000 troops at the border 
on wednesday has been engaged in a major defense buildup since 
saddam came to power in 1979 
but the iraniraq war left it with a foreign debt of about 70 
billion iraq borrowed 10 billion to 20 billion from kuwait wants 
that debt forgiven 
in kuwait early today the rattle of automatic guns sounded and 
explosions in rapid succession shook residents from their sleep and 
the kuwaiti cabinet quickly assembled 
the cabinet was holed up at the headquarters of the supreme 
defense council with telephone and telex links cut off said 
official sources 
kuwaiti radio briefly stopped broadcasting then went back on 
the air on a different wavelength a speaker believed to be crown 
prince and prime minister sheik saad alabdullah alsabah appealed 
for arab support 
oh arabs kuwaits blood and honor is being violated rush to 
its rescue the children the women the old men of kuwait are 
calling on you the speaker said

medical evidence showing that a teenager 
fatally shot in the back by police had his hands raised in 
surrender when the officer opened fire prompted the states top 
prosecutor to reopen the case lawyers said 
police said phillip pannell 16 had a gun and was reaching for 
it when officer gary spath shot him in april a discredited 
coroners report supported the story told by spath and partner 
officer wayne blanco 
attorney general robert del tufo on tuesday rejected the autopsy 
findings of bergen county medical examiner dr lawrence j denson 
and ordered a new grand jury investigation 
the errors included faulty forensic study and inaccurate 
autopsy analysis both of which led to an incorrect conclusion 
concerning the possible actions of mr pannell at the time he was 
shot del tufo said in a statement 
the first grand jury to investigate the case deadlocked without 
indicting either officer 
del tufo declined to detail the nature of the mistakes but a 
former lawyer for the pannell family and the attorney representing 
blanco said the state is studying whether the victim had his hands 
raised when he was shot 
an independent autopsy performed by dr howard adelman who was 
hired by the pannell family found that the boys hands were held 
high overhead said former family lawyer franklin wilks 
joseph t afflito who represents blanco he was told last week 
that del tufos office had new forensic evidence that suggested 
the boy might have had his hands up 
the location of the bullet hole in pannells coat in relation to 
his body wound indicated his hands were up and damage to his rib 
cage and upper torso muscles supported that conclusion wilks said 
citing adelmans findings 
afflito said state prosecutors offered blanco a chance to give 
new testimony this week blanco declined because he had already 
told the truth the lawyer said 
spath has been suspended with pay blanco has not been 
disciplined 
attorney robert galantucci who represents spath condemned del 
tufos call for a new investigation 
they shouldnt be playing politics with the grand jury 
system he said 
del tufo said denson admitted his mistake denson and adelman 
could not be reached for comment wednesday 
the shooting sparked a night of racial unrest in this new york 
city suburb and local black leaders praised del tufos rejection of 
the autopsy report 
the truth has now come out activists said in a statement 
wednesday the new grand jury will learn about this new evidence 
and we are confident spath will be indicted 
five organizations including the national association for the 
advancement of colored people and the rainbow coalition issued the 
statement at a news conference 
the attorney generals office has been given one more chance 
i urge them to make good use of it said raymond m brown the 
pannells current attorney 
pannell of river edge was shot after running from police who 
were responding to a call about a youth brandishing a gun after 
the shooting police said they found in pannells clothing an 
athletic starter pistol that had been modified to fire live 
ammunition

the defense minister said today that israel is 
ready to respond to any armed threat from iraq and that iraqs 
invasion of kuwait shows that its president saddam hussein poses 
a threat to the entire world 
the minister moshe arens told nbc television that saddams 
action was reminiscent of nazi germanys aggression in the 1930s 
iraqs forces overran its small oilrich neighbor in a lightning 
strike before dawn today 
iraq will be looking around for other targets arens said 
adding that saddam represents a threat to the entire world not 
just israel 
he told abc television in a separate interview that israel would 
step in only if iraq takes aggressive action against israel 
but an israeli government official who briefed reporters on the 
basis of anonymity said iraq was aware there were red lines 
that could not be crossed without bringing an israeli response 
asked if that included iraqi entry into jordan or syria the 
official said such a move would require very strong 
consideration by israel 
the israeli cabinet was to discuss the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
today 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamirs spokesman said the 
invasion bears out israels warnings that saddam poses a genuine 
threat 
we need to call on the international arena to open their eyes 
and see what is happening and to understand we need to take saddam 
hussein seriously that he threatens and then carries out the 
spokesman avi pazner told israel radio 
saddam had threatened military action against kuwait for its 
overproduction of oil which has reduced prices for iraqs oil 
after threats demands and abortive peace talks iraqi troops 
invaded 
pazner noted that iraq is heavily armed from its eightyear war 
with iran which ended in 1988 
iraq has also proven that it doesnt hesitate to use this 
against its immediate neighbors and this policy of saddam hussein 
is what endangers the regions security pazner said 
he said the iraqi attack made clear that if there is a danger 
to the stability in the middle east it is not our conflict with the 
palestinians 
yossi olmert director of the government press office said 
iraqs invasion of kuwait proved israel was right in taking 
seriously saddams repeated threats to attack israel with chemical 
weapons if it attacked any iraqi facilities 
there was a period a few weeks ago when his threats were only 
directed toward us and people outside israel didnt take him 
seriously olmert said 
yitzhak rabin a former defense minister also said the iraqi 
attack shows that the easing of ussoviet tensions has increased 
rather than lessened the danger of war in the middle east 
glasnost has not arrived in the middle east arms are still 
flowing into the middle east from all places rabin said on army 
radio

a man convicted of murder after plunging 
his stepson into a toilet should be spared the death penalty 
because hes had a pitiful life his parents told the jury thats 
considering his sentence today 
thomas coe 23 was born with painful kidney and hip defects 
wore a catheter until he was 5 was hospitalized more than 30 times 
and walked with a limp jurors learned wednesday 
coes mother mary coe anders said she had to pay other 
children to play with him 
his father don told jurors he ignored the boy he claimed was 
the result of an affair the mother had 
that doesnt excuse coe for killing 2yearold bradley mcgee 
last july lawyer robert norgard said but it shows he suffered 
ramifications on into adulthood and helps explain why coe 
shouldnt get the electric chair he said 
the jury which found coe guilty of firstdegree murder and 
aggravated child abuse on monday can recommend that circuit judge 
randall mcdonald give him death or life in prison without parole 
for 25 years 
even in prison coe could face an uncertain future 
lt mike pol a shift commander at the polk county jail said 
inmates have threatened to kill coe ever since his arrest on july 
29 1989 word of coes offense reached the jail as soon as he was 
booked and inmates hung upsidedown pictures of coe on the wall 
with a toilet underneath 
coe has been held in an isolation cell for protection and 
several times has been placed on suicide watch 
even in isolation inmates at the jail have managed to put glass 
and steel wool in coes food pol said once when coe was going to 
see the doctor inmates threw lye urine and feces on him coe had 
used urine and feces to punish his stepson according to trial 
testimony 
as a child coes physical problems were compounded by his 
parents divorce family and friends told the jury he was suicidal 
by age 18 and felt inadequate and out of place with peers 
the state called one witness during the penalty phase of the 
trial an assistant medical examiner who said bradley could feel 
pain when he was repeatedly plunged headfirst into the toilet for 
soiling his pants 
the boys head struck the bottom of the bowl and he later died 
of head injuries 
coes wife sheryl mcgee coe 21 pleaded no contest to 
seconddegree murder and aggravated child abuse in her sons death 
and is serving a 30year prison term

the aircraft carrier uss independence is 
steaming toward the persian gulf to beef up the us presence in 
the troubled region in response to iraqs invasion of kuwait 
pentagon sources said today 
the carrier escorted by its sixship battle group has been in 
the indian ocean as part of a regularly scheduled deployment the 
pentagon source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the

house condemned the iraqi invasion as naked aggression

lights burned throughout the night at the pentagon 
top military commanders and cheney aides including 
undersecretary of defense paul wolfowitz worked all night on 
bushs speech on defense issues and trying to respond to the crisis 
in the gulf 
us carriers traditionally have stayed out of the 
battlescarred waterway not only because of their size but also 
to prevent them from becoming targets 
however the presence of the forrestalclass carrier bristling 
with attack aircraft and missiles offers a potent symbol of us 
military power 
the ships escort craft include two cruisers including one of 
the aegis class a guided missile destroyer two frigates and one 
ammunition ship 
the carrier and its support group are prepared to bolster the 
us naval forces in the gulf an eightship group led by the uss

the six ships that have been stationed there the pentagon said

sen alan simpson of wyoming accepted 90600 
in honoraria last year republican colleague david durenberger of 
minnesota took 62185 across the aisle democratic sens david 
boren of oklahoma and don riegle of michigan each raked in more 
than 52000 
yet the four were among 77 senators who voted wednesday to ban 
outside speaking fees lining up to partake in one of capitol 
hills favorite events a free vote indeed 56 of the 77 voting 
to ban honoraria accepted such payments last year to the tune of 
nearly 2 million 
several of the 56 have since stopped accepting honoraria but 
for the rest who still do wednesdays vote most likely will not 
choke the flow of millions in speaking and appearance fees from 
special interests 
last year alone senators accepted nearly 3 million in 
honoraria and kept 21 million for personal use giving the rest 
to charity in most cases to keep within senate limits on outside 
income 
the vote wednesday was significant if only symbolically 
because for the first time the senate went on record against 
accepting special interest fees such honoraria have figured 
prominently in several recent ethics cases against lawmakers and 
were banned on the house side effective this year 
but the provision sponsored by democratic sen christopher dodd 
of connecticut was attached to a campaign finance measure that is 
vehemently opposed by republicans lawmakers and the bush 
administration 
the overall measure cleared the senate late wednesday night but 
the house has yet to act on the issue and has major differences 
with the senate on top of that president bush is promising to 
veto the legislation if it carries the senatepassed provisions 
this bill clearly will not become law sen mitch mcconnell 
of kentucky told his colleagues after speaking to white house chief 
of staff john sununu 
thus in the words of senate minority leader bob dole the 
amendment gave senators a chance to vote no and take the dough 
at least until the proposal is attached to legislation with a 
better chance of becoming law 
but some publicly hailed the vote hoping to keep the pressure 
on senators 
it is just a matter of time before the senate joins the rest 
of the federal government in banning private interest speaking fees 
for personal use said common cause president fred wertheimer 
election day is just three months away and the proposal to ban 
honoraria was popular among senators facing voters this year even 
many who have handsomely supplemented their senate salary in the 
past 
among those voting for the proposal who face reelection were 
democratic sens max baucus of montana joseph biden of delaware 
david boren of oklahoma albert gore of tennessee howell heflin of 
alabama j bennett johnston of louisiana sam nunn of georgia 
david pryor of arkansas and paul simon of illinois they accepted a 
combined total of 335148 in honoraria last year 
on the republican side five senators up for reelection this 
year who accepted at least 20000 in honoraria in 1989 voted in 
favor of the ban dan coats of indiana william cohen of maine 
larry pressler of south dakota alan simpson of wyoming and ted 
stevens of alaska they accepted a combined 212900 last year 
also voting in favor of the ban was gop sen pete wilson the 
republican candidate for governor in california who accepted 
48500 in 1989 
six republican senators up for reelection this year apparently 
undaunted by the potential use of their vote as a campaign issue 
voted against the ban the six sens mcconnell of kentucky mark 
hatfield of oregon phil gramm of texas pete domenici of new 
mexico thad cochran of mississippi and rudy boschwitz of minnesota 
collected a combined 212815 in honoraria last year 
the dodd proposal also found favor among all six senators with 
cases pending before the ethics committee democrat dennis 
deconcini of arizona alan cranston of california john glenn of 
ohio and riegle and republicans john mccain of arizona and alfonse 
damato of new york 
cranston deconcini and glenn were among 21 senators who did not 
accept honoraria in 1989 riegle mccain and damato accepted a 
combined 125000 in honoraria last year with mccain giving all 
30250 of his to charity

south korea said today all citizens 
would be allowed to apply to visit communist north korea during a 
fiveday period next month provided the north guarantees their 
safe return 
the announcement was the first time south korea has offered to 
let all citizens apply to cross the border and visit the north a 
1985 exchange program was limited to about 100 people who were 
members of separated families 
we hopethis would not only lead to the reunion of separated 
families but also the sharing of the emotional excitment by 
embracing each other after 45 years of separation unification 
minister hong sungchul told reporters 
all applicants accepted by the north would be allowed to cross 
the border aug 1317 hong said that implied that even if the 
north chooses to allow only south korean dissidents to visit the 
south would allow them to go 
previously the seoul governments position has been that 
koreans from all walks of life must be included in proposed 
travel exchanges 
hong said the government expected north korea to guarantee the 
travelers safe travel and return to south korea by communicating 
on a governmenttogovernment basis not via a radio broadcast 
north korea frequently issues pronouncements concerning policy 
on north korean radio broadcasts monitored in tokyo 
the seoul governments announcement follows a july 20 
proclamation by south korean president roh taewoo calling for a 
fiveday border opening to allow free and unrestricted travel 
between the hostile koreas the north had earlier proposed a more 
limited oneday border opening 
north korea effectively rejected rohs proposal by listing a set 
of conditions unlikely to be met including release of political 
prisoners dismantling of border barriers and abolition of 
anticommunist security laws 
when the south proposed a meeting to discuss the preconditions 
the north did not reply 
by todays announcement and presentation of an application form 
the government appears to be trying to put pressure on the north to 
accept a trial exchange 
the korean peninsula was divided into the communist north and 
capitalist south in 1945 and the two nations fought a civil war in 
the early 1950s 
the border between the koreas is the most heavily fortified in 
the world with more than 15 million armed troops behind concrete 
bunkers and barbed wire on either side 
there are no telephone radio television or travel exchanges

the un security council today swiftly 
condemned iraqs invasion of kuwait demanding an unconditional 
withdrawal of iraqi troops and calling for immediate negotiations 
between the countries 
the iraqi envoy said his countrys troops would withdraw as 
soon as the situation is stable perhaps within a few days or 
some weeks 
the security council resolution was adopted 140 in an emergency 
session requested by the united states and kuwait hours after 
todays predawn invasion neither kuwait nor iraq is on the 
15member council 
the representative of yemen said he did not vote because he had 
not received instructions from his government 
britains un envoy crispin tickell condemned the invasion as 
an ugly moment in world affairs kuwait is a former british 
colony 
the united states has made it clear that it will stand 
shoulder to shoulder with kuwait in this time of crisis us 
ambassador thomas pickering told the council it is our 
understanding that the present aggression was completely 
unprovoked 
baghdad radio claimed iraq had come to the aid of 
revolutionary youth in kuwait whom it said had toppled the 
kuwaiti government 
kuwaits ambassador to the united nations mohammad abulhasan 
denied the invasion was in response to a call from help from a new 
government 
the pretext to invade an independent sovereign state is a 
false flimsy pretext he said this kind of pretext if its 
not going to be deterred in a decisive manner and by this august 
assembly all international relations will be threatened no 
country at all will be safe after this 
a statement read by sabah talat kadrat iraqs deputy permanant 
representative said iraqs forces would withdraw when what it 
referred to as the free kuwaiti interim government requested it 
the iraqi statement was also reported by the iraqi news agency 
in baghdad 
the security council resolution said the council supports all 
efforts for negotiations between iraq and kuwait it specifically 
endorsed mediation efforts by the arab league which met in 
emergency session in cairo today 
the iraqi invasion posed a breach of international peace and 
security the security council said 
kadrat said the events were related to an internal matter that 
was not the councils concern 
the iraqi government firmly believes and states that iraq is 
pursuing no goal or objective and wishes only cordial relations 
with kuwait said kadrat furthermore it is the kuwaitis 
themselves who will determine their own future and iraqi forces 
will withdraw as soon as order has been restored 
members of the 15member security council began gathering at the 
united nations shortly after midnight diplomats held more than 
three hours of private consultations before convening the formal 
meeting 
kuwaiti spokesman nasser alsabeeh said before the formal 
meeting that kuwait wants negotiations with iraq to be mediated by 
the arab league 
but if its necessary then we would seek un mediation he 
said 
two weeks ago president saddam hussein of iraq threatened 
military action with kuwait over its violation of opec oil 
production ceilings and a disputed border oil field 
saddam also has accused some persian gulf nations of conspiring 
with the united states and israel to weaken iraqs economy and 
undermine its military buildup 
todays resolution was sponsored by canada colombia ivory 
coast ethiopia finland france the united states britain and 
malaysia 
the 15 members of the security council are china yemen

uzbekistans government announced steps today to 
implement a presidential order to seize weapons from illegally 
armed groups 
the uzbekistan council of ministers ordered city councils to 
collect illegal arms in their regions tass reported 
the official soviet news agency said 3685 weapons were seized 
or handed in voluntarily before president mikhail s gorbachevs 
july 25 decree tass said 254 stolen guns were still missing 
gorbachev gave illegally armed groups throughout the soviet 
union 15 days to disband themselves and turn in their weapons or 
risk having them confiscated by security forces 
it was his latest attempt to reduce ethnic violence in the 
southern caucasus and central asian republics that has killed more 
than 400 people in the last two years 
the armenian parliament has voted to ignore the decree although 
tass reported today that lawmakers said they would be willing to 
discuss their decision with gorbachev who is vacationing in the 
crimea 
armenian nationalists said earlier this week the decision would 
also extend to the disputed territory of nagornokarabakh a mostly 
armenian enclave inside the neighboring republic of azerbaijan 
georgia has also refused to implement the decree at least until 
its parliament resumes work on aug 17 
azerbaijans interior ministry published a commentary in todays

agencies powers to restore order and neutralize extremists the 
interfax news agency reported 
in the armenian capital yerevan 100 flamethrowers were seized

roswell gilbert walked out of a florida 
prison a free man today after serving 5 years for the 1985 mercy 
killing of his ailing wife 
the 81yearold gilbert granted clemency by gov bob martinez 
and the florida cabinet because he suffers from heart and lung 
disease was freed from the north florida reception center at lake 
butler shortly after 9 am 
gilbert who had breakfast earlier at the prison with his 
daughter martha moran of baltimore smiled broadly as he left the 
jail but he expressed remorse over the killing of his wife who 
suffered from alzheimers disease 
i shouldnt have killed my wife now i know that he said 
i know the public at least understood what i did if they didnt 
approve of it 
he called the slaying an act of desperation 
that was an error i made gilbert said thats not an 
excuse but thats what it was its such a personal thing 
its difficult to explain to anybody 
he called alzheimers a horror an absolute horror and said 
he believes euthanasia should be legalized for some cases 
mrs moran said she believes her mother would say its about 
time they let him out 
gilbert and his daughter planned to drive to the fort lauderdale 
area where he will spend several days at an undisclosed location 
before returning to his condominium in fort lauderdale 
gilbert tried to light a cigarette just after entering the 
rental car but his daughter and attorney brad stark objected 
no this no that joked gilbert im free now 
gilbert who lost nearly 40 pounds in prison said he needed to 
begin rebuilding his health but pledged not to give up smoking 
despite his lung problems 
im a tough old rooster he said 
gilbert was serving a 25year prison term for murder in the 1985 
shooting of his wife emily who had alzheimers disease and 
osteoporosis 
the case depicted in the 1987 tv movie mercy or murder 
focused national attention on the socalled mercy killing of an 
ailing loved one 
gilbert had said his wife begged him to end her misery 
prosecutors claimed the retired engineer killed the 73yearold 
woman because she had become a burden to him 
the inmate was examined in january and doctors said he suffered 
from heart and lung disease and was at high risk of death at any 
time 
in florida clemency requires the approval of the governor and 
at least three of the six members of the independently elected 
cabinet 
the needed votes came quickly with comptroller gerald lewis 
education commissioner betty castor and attorney general bob 
butterworth signing the petition less than 90 minutes after 
martinez announced plans to grant clemency 
mr gilberts declining health and the likelihood that his 
condition will continue to deteriorate if he remains in prison 
leads me to the conclusion that he should be granted clemency 
said martinez who previously opposed freeing gilbert 
i dont really condone the action that occurred some years 
ago but youve got to mix that with some compassion

farmers furniture refinishers and funeral 
homes are being denied credit because lenders fear being stuck with 
cleanup costs if pollution is found on the properties the 
president of a small ohio bank told congress today 
businesses that use chemicals such as auto paint and embalming 
fluids and properties with underground storage tanks are considered 
undesirable loan risks because of recent court interpretations of 
the 10yearold superfund law said r duane lillibridge president 
of farmers savings bank northwood ohio 
farmland is considered highly suspect and unfortunately we 
are being forced to wind down our loans in this critical sector of 
our economy lillibridge told the house transportation and 
hazardous materials subcommittee 
if we are unable to obtain some relief ohio bankers will 
soon be unable to look to real estate as collateral he said in 
prepared testimony 
the superfund law gave the federal government the power to move 
in on heavily polluted properties clean up the contamination and 
then force the property owners to pay for it in may the 11th us 
circuit court of appeals ruled that a lender that forecloses on a 
polluted property could be held liable for cleanup costs under 
superfund 
the subcommitees chairman rep thomas luken dohio said the 
court rulings on superfund liability could have an ominous impact 
on the 500 billion taxpayer cost of the savings and loan bailout 
and inflate these astronomical figures even more 
the federal deposit insurance corp submitted testimony 
estimating 270 properties in its possession may have superfund 
problems luken said 
all american taxpayers have an important stake in how these 
problems are resolved said luken who supports a bill by rep 
john lafale dny to exempt lenders from superfund liability when 
they foreclose on contaminated property 
rep frank pallone dnj criticized the bill this week in a 
letter to fellow house members the bill condones bad loans to 
polluting businesses and tells lenders that the government will 
clean up after them he wrote 
the environmental protection agency submitted testimony 
announcing it intends to resolve the issue by issuing a rule 
expeditiously 
epa agrees that lender liability needs to be as certain and 
predictable as possible testified james m strock the agencys 
assistant administrator for enforcement

foreigners living in kuwait said they 
watched from their windows or dived for cover when iraq staged a 
lightning invasion of kuwait today 
reached by telephone from bahrain the expatriates told of 
hearing gunfire explosions and jets and helicopters overhead as 
the iraqi troops moved in before dawn 
unbelievable said catherine baker 37 of illinois who 
works for a british design firm in the small oilrich nation it 
doesnt seem real 
there are about 4000 americans among the large expatriate 
community in kuwait where more than 60 percent of the 18 million 
residents are foreigners ms baker said she was shocked by the 
suddenness of the iraqi strike although iraqi president saddam 
hussein had made threats against kuwait in recent weeks 
we were totally unprepared she said one feels like there 
should have been a bit of warning 
us officials monitoring the situation had no reports that us 
citizens in iraq had been harmed white house spokesman roman 
popadiuk said 
diplomats said the british embassy was hit by shellfire and the 
sheraton and hilton hotels evacuated their clientele 
diplomatic sources in the persian gulf estimated that more than 
200 kuwaitis were killed or wounded in the invasion 
kathy mcgregor 32 a canadian said one explosion was close 
enough to shake her home 
you know when you see a movie when people dive for cover we 
did it the explosion blew inside the house shaking it she said 
its chaos military jets are flying over all the time ms 
mcgregor said by telephone early today as she watched from her 
window but in the afternoon she said things had quieted down 
considerably 
there is not much noise or gunfire i feel better with more 
people around now she said 
some expatriates said they did not want to leave despite the 
invasion 
i think it will be over soon somehow said serge sejournet 
30 an artist from paris i dont think i want to get out of 
kuwait 
sejournet said the iraqi soldiers on the street in front of his 
home in downtown kuwait were very friendly with everyone saying 
hello to all 
sejournet said he thought the united states would bring the 
situation under control 
president bush said the united states which has warships in 
the persian gulf area and more on the way according to reports out 
of washington would take whatever steps necessary to defend 
interests in the region 
asked if this included military force bush said were not 
discussing intervention but he said he would not discuss 
military options publicly 
sejournet ms baker and other expatriates said they gathered 
together in homes of friends listening to the fighting 
western diplomats said the invasion was too sudden to try to 
carry out any evacuation for the time being they simply advised 
foreign residents to keep a low profile until the situation was 
calmer 
anxious friends and relatives of those living in kuwait found it 
difficult or impossible to get in touch with them in washington a 
spokesman for atampt said calls to kuwait reached 2000 every five 
minutes 
the spokesman herb linnen said only some of the calls were 
getting through and there were long delays because of the heavy 
volume 
linnen said the company itself had managed to get only one call 
through to its employees in kuwait today and ascertained that the 
several dozen employees and their families were safe 
atampt employees in kuwait include americans canadians british 
filipinos and one sri lankan who have been working on a project 
with the kuwaiti government to improve communications he said 
the state department meanwhile set up a 24hour hotline for 
people seeking information about the safety of american relatives 
and friends in kuwait and iraq the number is 202 6470900

the ukrainian city of chervonograd dismantled its 
monument to vladimir lenin and has ordered karl marxs monument be 
removed within three days tass reported thursday 
the orders were made during an emergency session of the city 
council on wednesday the official soviet news agency said it did 
not elaborate 
tass quoted the regional prosecutor in nearby lvov as saying the 
councils orders were illegal and should be repealed 
the councils decision violates the ukrainian law on the 
protection and use of historical and cultural monuments leonid 
izosimov told tass 
the western ukrainian city of ternopol has also outraged local 
communists by ordering the dismantling or sale of monuments to 
lenin the soviet founder and marx the father of modern 
communism moscow city council voted earlier this year to remove a 
bust of lenin from its chambers 
statues of lenin have also been toppled or damaged in recent 
weeks in two dozen towns in southern georgia and in lithuania 
attempts were made to deface them in azerbaijan and armenia 
since president mikhail s gorbachev came to power in 1985 
statues plaques and other memorials to disgraced soviet leaders 
such as josef stalin and leonid i brezhnev have been removed 
official criticism of lenin however has been taboo and for 
many he remains a figure of reverence and grandfatherly affection

what was intended to be a simple gesture of 
international friendship has turned into a source of embarrassment 
for missouri highway and economic development officials 
the multilingual sign they erected outside st louis lambert 
airport to welcome foreign visitors was botched in three of seven 
languages 
their intentions were definitely good and i can understand 
how these things happen but they should have consulted a 
dictionary said antonio m molina of suburban university city 
molina said the spanish welcome bienvendos a missouri 
should have read bienvenidos a missouri molina should know 
his father the late jose molina was the honorary vice consul from 
spain and his greatuncle jose alvarez held the post before him 
the german and french salutations also were misspelled or 
grammatically incorrect wilkommen in missouri should have read 
willkommen in missouri according to james mcleod professor of 
german at washington university 
the french version bienvenue a missouri should read 
bienvenue en missouri 
the preposition is wrong people arriving here from france 
would laugh at the sign said jacques chicoineau a retired 
professor of foreign languages at webster university 
the greetings in japanese chinese and korean were perfect 
however oh yes they also got the english greeting right 
jacque dunn director of public affairs for the states 
department of economic development said her office was 
reconfirming the translations dunn said the translations had been 
made with the help of the departments offices overseas

a navigation satellite boosted into 
orbit by a delta rocket thursday is the latest in a series of 
spacecrafts capable of pinpointing the location of us military 
units to within 50 feet 
the unmanned rocket thundered into a clear sky at 139 am 
trailing fire as it headed out over the atlantic 
the 65 million navstar satellite separated from the booster on 
schedule about 25 minutes into the flight and settled into an orbit 
10898 miles high 
the satellite is the eighth in a series of advanced global 
positioning system spacecraft that guide us and allied warplanes 
ships submarines and troops in some cases it is accurate to 
within 10 feet 
the air force plans to send up 16 more satellites by early 1993 
three of them spares under the 85 billion program the first 
navstar spacecraft was launched in february 1989

the senate today gave president bush an extra 
months authority to begin pumping oil from the nations strategic 
petroleum reserve into the market should iraqs invasion of kuwait 
disrupt world oil supplies 
on a voice vote the senate passed a temporary extension of the 
energy policy conservation act that established the 
580millionbarrel rainyday stockpile of unrefined crude oil in 
response to the 197374 arab oil embargo 
without the extension bushs authority to start pumping oil 
from the reserve would have expired aug 15 while congress is on 
vacation 
the events in the middle east today underscore once again the 
fragility of the economies of the western world and the marginal 
supply of energy that fuels it said sen james mcclure ridaho 
the stockpile located in salt caverns along the louisianatexas 
coast contains oil worth 20 billion 
the administration and congress have been battling for the past 
18 months over whether to increase the stockpiles size to 1 
billion barrels bush opposes the increase 
the least we can do is to preserve the most important tool 
that we have constructed so far mcclure said it is important 
to take this emergency action on a temporary extension while we 
try to resolve larger policy questions 
the system could now replace 80 days of oil imports according 
to the senate energy committee that cushion has fallen from 110 
days in the middle 1980s because of growing us dependence on 
foreign crude

the house foreign affairs committee endorsing 
president bushs move for an economic embargo against iraq 
convened hastily today to begin writing the white house sanctions 
into law 
the senate meanwhile extended by a month the presidents 
authority to begin pumping oil from the nations 580millionbarrel 
strategic petroleum reserve into the market should the invasion 
disrupt world oil supplies 
but some members of congress criticized the administration 
saying there had been a total misjudgment of the policies and 
goals of iraqi president haddam hussein prior to iraqs invasion 
of kuwait 
we have no intention of doing anything but codifying the 
presidents executive order said house foreign affairs committee 
chairman dante fascell dfla we want to indicate through 
legislation that we are in full support of the presidents action 
the panel was seeking to rewrite legislation it approved a day 
earlier that would have cut off iraqs 200 million a year in 
exportimport bank credits and tightened restrictions on us 
exports which could have dual civilian and military uses 
house speaker thomas s foley said the chamber would pass the 
measure later in the day it is a matter of gravest concern to 
the united states government he said 
foley said it was too early to say what if any steps the 
nation should take militarily obviously the united states has 
to keep all of its options open he said he refused to criticize 
bush for opposing earlier sanctions against iraq saying it would 
be foolish to think they would have prevented the invasion 
but rep tom lantos dcalif accused the bush administration 
of a policy of appeasement prior to the invasion which had 
emboldened saddam 
there was a total misjudgment of the policies and goals of 
saddam hussein to the very moment his troops invaded a neighboring 
country lantos said 
on a voice vote the senate passed a temporary extension of the 
energy policy conservation act that established the stockpile of 
unrefined crude oil in response to the 197374 arab oil embargo 
bushs authority to begin pumping oil from the reserve located 
in salt caverns along the louisianatexas coast would have expired 
august 15 while congress is on vacation without the extension 
its clear the president has responded boldly and 
comprehensively in severing exports and imports and in freezing 
assets of iraq and kuwait in the united states said rep stephen 
solarz dny he said it was important that congress and the 
administration speak with one voice in condemning iraqs action 
rep mel levine dcalif said many have been urging this 
administration to take saddam hussein much more seriously than they 
have 
the author of the original sanctions bill rep howard berman 
dcalif said the reagan administration had begun the policy when 
it tilted toward iraq during its eightyear war with iran and 
urged allies to provide military equipment to the baghdad 
government overlooking that regimes support for terrorism and its 
human rights violations 
sen christopher dodd dconn said he would not rule out 
military action perhaps in cooperation with other countries in the 
region to deal with the threat from iraq 
youre dealing with a madman here dodd said of iraqi 
president saddam hussein im not sure hes going to respond to 
sanctions he said he believed that military moves will be 
necessary at some point because the invasion poses a 
significant and very real threat to the entire region 
dodd like many others on capitol hill compared saddam to 
hitler there was another time in this century when weve watched 
the first actions of a madman and said sooner or later theyll be 
satisfied well i dont believe they will be 
added sen patrick leahy dvt youre talking about 
something that could totally unravel the whole middle east talk 
about the analogy of the fuse being lit its being lit in kuwait

cross team in a rural area on the central philippine island of 
negros not far from where he was abducted on june 13 
its just great its just wonderful news swansons father 
leonard swanson told radio station krae in cheyenne after learning 
of his sons release 
you feel like a whole big weight has been taken off said 
his mother lynn swanson

visited cheyenne on july 20 called thursday morning with his best 
wishes they said 
im tired im very happy swanson told reporters after his 
release they treated me well im ok and i want to go home 
us ambassador nicholas platt welcomed swansons release 
saying the embassy is relieved that he is safe unharmed and 
apparently in good health 
the united states ordered the evacuation of peace corps workers 
in the philippines on june 27 because intelligence information 
indicated the communist rebels might try to kill or kidnap them 
by that time swanson was already in rebel hands but his 
filipino wife said she had been ordered by the rebels not to tell 
anyone swanson had been living and working in the remote mountain 
village of patag about 320 miles southeast of manila 
us officials said they learned of swansons abduction on june 
30 when they tried to contact him 
us embassy spokesman stanley schrager said swanson probably 
would stay in manila for a few days and then leave for the united 
states 
earlier thursday the new peoples army rebels freed fumio 
mizuno a japanese aid worker who had been held since may 29 
mizuno of the organization of industrial spiritual and cultural 
advancement appeared in good health 
rebels said they seized the two because their organizations were 
suspected of supporting the philippine governments 
counterinsurgency campaign relief organizations have denied any 
such involvement 
the new peoples army has been waging a 21year insurgency to 
establish a marxist state 
the incident caused some strain in usphilippine ties when 
the pullout of peace corps workers was ordered some philippines 
officials complained that the action was too hasty and said they 
should have been consulted first 
then after the abduction was disclosed us officials said it 
proved their intelligence information had been correct 
in cheyenne swansons mother said she was planning to bake 
rhubarb pie and stock up on steaks to celebrate her sons 
homecoming

marion barrys lawyer described the mayors 
accusers today as facile liars and little lucifers as he 
urged that barry be acquitted of all 14 criminal charges against 
him 
the governments exhaustive investigation of barrys drug use 
amounted to using a sledgehammer to kill a fly defense 
attorney r kenneth mundy told the jury in closing arguments at the 
mayors drug and perjury trial 
the jurors verdict should be not guilty mundy told the 
panel 
if the governments witnesses such as former model rasheeda 
moore and admitted cocaine dealer charles lewis werent devils 
they were at least little lucifers or small satans said mundy 
the witnesses were facile liars right here in your very 
presence he added 
mundy said the mayor has occasionally used cocaine but he said 
the government was not justified in pursuing barry as vigorously as 
it did 
on wednesday assistant us attorney judith retchin in her 
closing argument called barry a general in the war on drugs 
who was working with the other side 
retchin summarizing six weeks of trial testimony told the jury 
that barry used drugs in every quadrant of this city for years 
and wrapped himself in a web of deception to cover it up 
if mr barrys drug use were so rampant he could have been 
discovered in a more traditional way mundy said the cure is 
manyfold worse than the ailment 
the government in effect used a sledgehammer to kill a fly 
mundy said describing the lengthy investigation of the mayor that 
culminated in barrys jan 18 arrest in an undercover sting 
operation 
mundy lashed out at government witnesses who testified against 
barry contending they described the mayor using drugs only to save 
themselves from prosecution 
how trustworthy how believable and credible is the testimony 
of anyone under that kind of pressure mundy asked the jury 
they are prosecuting him because he is the mayor 
mundy who began his presentation wednesday was concluding his 
statement today followed by a final argument by the prosecution 
the jury then will receive its instructions from us district 
judge thomas penfield jackson and begin deliberations 
the mayor has pleaded innocent to 10 counts of cocaine 
possession three felony charges of lying to the grand jury and one 
count of conspiracy each perjury count carries a maximum fiveyear 
prison term 
on wednesday mundy said he was trying to gain the respect of 
the jury by acknowledging that the mayor has used cocaine 
i will start right from the beginning by telling you that mr 
barry used cocaine he said we do not intend to give you the 
imression for one moment that there was not occasional drug use by 
mr barry 
but the government adopted the philosophy of the ends justify 
the means to catch the mayor using drugs mundy argued 
everything that the government could amass against him was put 
forward 
retchin said a government sting operation at the vista 
international hotel was necessary to expose barrys drug use the 
mayor was arrested jan 18 after he was videotaped smoking 
fbisupplied crack cocaine in a hotel bedroom 
mundy accused federal authorities of using the equivalent of an 
illegal war weapon to catch him using cocaine in the sting 
operation 
the danger of mustard gas which was the sting at the vista 
is that it cuts at the very fabric of our society the defense 
attorney said it might be mr barry today someone else 
tomorrow 
most of those who testified against barry had no one to back up 
their stories and could not provide much detail mundy said 
there was very rarely a situation where there is corroborating 
testimony about these things he said 
the threeterm mayor denied he was involved with drugs in grand 
jury testimony and in public statements but retchin said the sting 
operation breaks the shield of secrecy 
the evidence is overwhelming that barry relied on a close 
group of friends to get him cocaine because they wanted city 
jobs city contracts and the power that comes with knowing the 
mayor the prosecutor said 
she recounted testimony from 10 friends and associates of the 
mayor who said they saw barry use cocaine about 200 times from 1983 
through jan 18

appealed today for direct us military intervention to repulse the 
iraqi forces he said are controlling his nation 
we dont stand a chance if we dont get any aid from our 
friends ambassador saud nasser alsabah told reporters at a 
press briefing at the embassy 
asked what type of help he wanted the ambassador replied im 
talking about military intervention us intervention at this 
stage is of paramount importance 
hours later iraqs ambassador mohamed sadiq almashat 
summoned reporters to his embassy where he said any foreign 
interference will only aggravate the situation 
despite kuwaits protestations almashat said the events 
currently occurring in kuwait are an internal affair and that 
iraq harbors no special objectives in kuwait 
iraq he said is desirous of establishing relations of 
fraternity and good neighborliness with it 
standing in front of a lifesized picture of iraqi president 
saddam hussein almashat read a prepared statement but refused to 
answer questions 
bush told reporters at an early morning news conference at the 
white house that he was not considering taking military steps 
the united states strongly condemns the iraqi military 
invasion of kuwait and calls for the immediate and unconditional 
withdrawal of all the iraqi forces bush said 
sources at the pentagon said the aircraft carrier uss 
independence was en route to the persian gulf to bolster us 
forces there however the sources said the carrier would not enter 
the gulf 
ambassador alsabah speaking in a somber tone said that kuwait 
was under occupation by a belligerent power 
he said that he had talked within the last 30 minutes to members 
of the ruling family who he said were in good health and in a 
safe place to conduct the resistance that is taking place inside

resistance from saudi arabia the ambassador said 
he said all kuwait government facilities including the ministry 
buildings had been occupied by the iraqis who are heading toward 
the southern part of the country where the oil installations are 
located 
alsabah gave only sketchy details of the resistance and of the 
situation on the ground but he said there were numerous 
casualties he had no estimates and said the state department had 
been told there were no americans at risk

department and at the white house and had relayed his requests for 
assistance to them 
administration officials were weighing the request but had not 
responded he said 
kuwait alsabah said would be willing to accept help from 
other countries 
we are desperate for any help we can get he said 
describing it as a universal cry for help 
alsabah said bitterly that his government had been assured by 
other powers that iraq would not follow through with its menacing 
threats of the last week the united states was among those 
countries that reassured kuwait he said noting that they had been 
proved wrong 
the arab nations are holding an emergency meeting in cairo to

since the dawn of independence the sons of kuwait have aspired 
to freedom to participation with their arab brothers in the 
realization of the goals of the nation and the recuperation of 
usurped arab rights especially in palestine 
but the colonialists who had governed the country plundered its 
riches and humiliated the people before independence either 
directly or through the intermediary of their agents certain 
members of the alsabah family handed the reins of power to that 
same clique after independence letting them set up around their 
family an oligarchic despotic and corrupt power 
the fictitious institutions that this regime installed were not 
able to camouflage its reality which the people divined right from 
the first minute 
as the years went by the people became more and more convinced 
that this clique was determined to pursue its monopolization of 
power and its plundering of the riches of the country by 
collaborating with a small number of mercenaries relying 
principally on foreign forces 
falsification of elections authoritarianism persecution of 
patriotic personalities have always been characteristics of the 
regime of the alsabah family and of its stability the 
dissolution of the last parliament which put the despotism and the 
corruption of the regime under the limelight is a proof of the 
violation by this regime of the constitution and of the terrorism 
to which it had recourse every time it was cornered by the patriots 
this clique which was in the service of foreigners before 
independence remained so after independence it attached our 
interests and our wealth to foreign interests and even to certain 
known zionists it stained the reputation of our people putting 
hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign banks and in investments 
linked to zionist circles 
some of them in the alsabah family were known for their 
intransigence and corruption and were among the most faithful men 
of colonialism they collaborated and coordinated with it they 
intrigued and plotted in the vilest basest manner against the 
nation and its noble causes 
their last conspiracy was the one they hatched against iraq 
which assumed its responsibility to defend the eastern gateway of 
the arab nation kuwait and the countries of the persian gulf 
and suffered tremendous sacrifices to conserve their soil honor 
and dignity 
in this conspiracy with zionist and colonialist aims this 
alsabah family clique pulled off its mask manifesting its 
hostility to kuwait and the arab nation like a satellite in the 
pay of colonialism and zionism 
this is the reality of this clique that governed the country 
this is why the patriotic forces which rejected despotism 
injustice and corruption and resisted this regime attached to 
zionist and colonialist circles decided relying on gods will 
and the will of the people to assume power and topple this 
despotic satellite regime 
we declare the destitution from power of emir jaber alahmed 
alsabah and crown prince saad alabdullah alsabah as well as 
the dissolution of the national assembly and the formation of a 
free provisional government that will assume legislative and 
executive responsibilities during a transitional period and will 
organize free honest elections in order to elect an assembly that

senate backers of legislation that would 
compensate victims of radiation exposure in the western states 
predicted on thursday that the bill will be passed quickly by the 
house and accepted by president bush 
by voice vote early thursday the senate approved the bill to 
establish a 100 million governmentadministered trust fund to 
assist hundreds of radiation victims 
those victims whether a downwinder receiving radiation 
fallout from nuclear devices detonated in nevada or miners digging 
uranium will now be eligible for compensation said sen orrin 
hatch rutah the bills sponsor 
the white house initially had opposed the bill and the justice 
department was concerned that claims would be handled by the us 
claims court rather than the department 
but hatch told a news conference that as late as last night i 
was told they would not oppose this bill 
under the legislation a person who was harmed while standing 
downwind of the governments atomic test site in nevada in the 
1950s and 1960s could receive a onetime damage award of 50000 
damages would be for injury or death to the victim 
a uranium miner who was unwittingly exposed to harmful doses of 
ionizing radiation from 1947 to 1971 would be entitled to a 
onetime damage award of 100000 
to qualify for damages claimants must be residents of specified 
areas and have suffered certain types of cancer including leukemia 
and lymphomas 
hatch and sens alan simpson dwyo harry reid dnev and 
pete domenici rnm said it would be difficult for the white 
house to oppose the legislation 
this is a bill that gallops through the place said simpson 
the senate republican whip he said the bill was compassionate 
it provides an apology 
the government has finally admitted negligence hatch said 
weve fought through layers of red tape for years through 
litigation reversals and years of pain suffered by those people 
who lived through the horrors of a death they could not see 
radiation

orders to factories for manufactured goods 
slumped in june for the third time this year the government said 
thursday the report added to analysts fears of a possible 
recession that were intensified by rising oil prices resulting from 
iraqs invasion of kuwait 
the economy is walking on a precipice and doesnt need 
something to come up and give it a shove said robert g 
dederick chief economist with the northern trust co of chicago 
shortly after the iraqi army pushed into neighboring kuwait oil 
prices soared amid fears the invasion would reduce the worlds oil 
supply at the same time the commerce department reported a 15 
percent drop in orders for both durable and nondurable factory 
goods more evidence of economic weakness 
were in a precarious position on the edge of a recession 
said thomas runiewicz an economist with the wefa group in bala 
cynwyd pa with the problems in the middle east and the threat 
of higher oil prices that may be just enough to push us over 
on the other hand chairman michael boskin of president bushs 
council of economic advisers contended that a 25 percent hike in 
oil prices could be absorbed by the economy without halting its 
growth 
even if the higher price is enforced our economy today is 
much better able to absorb modest price increases boskin told 
the congressional joint economic committee 
iraq and kuwait produce onefifth of the total oil produced by 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries and their oil 
accounts for an estimated 5 percent of daily us consumption 
in its report on factory orders the commerce department said 
the decline was concentrated in durable goods bigticket items 
expected to last more than three years they fell 28 percent to 
1251 billion after a 22 percent advance a month earlier 
nondurable orders were flat at 1123 billion 
dederick noted that factory orders have bounced up and down 
throughout the first half of the year and as a result the 
manufacturing sector is really just spinning its wheels 
orders plummeted 55 percent in january the sharpest drop 
since a 70 percent decrease in december 1974 they then rose 18 
percent in february and 40 percent in march before dropping 21 in 
april orders were up 22 percent in may 
and as orders decline industry tends to cut production and 
jobs in fact the labor department reported earlier the loss of 
31000 factory jobs in june 
because many factory items particularly durable goods are 
purchased through loans the manufacturing sector has borne the 
brunt of high interest rates engineered by the federal reserve as 
its sought to slow the economy to dampen inflationary pressures 
but even if the higher oil prices do not jolt the economy into 
recession they will tend to drive up overall living costs and 
hamper the central banks antiinflation efforts 
the factory orders report did contain at least one hopeful sign 
a 06 percent gain to 361 billion in the key category of 
nondefense capital goods this barometer of business investment 
plans had fallen 18 percent in may 
over half of the durables decline was in defense goods which 
dropped 203 percent to 80 billion excluding defense orders 
would have dropped 07 percent

the senate passed a spending bill thursday 
that includes full funding for a huge atom smasher in texas and 
nearly 3 billion for a new program to clean up nuclear 
contamination from weapons plants 
the 208 billion spending measure also contains hundreds of 
millions for water projects in the home states of senators who put 
together the package the measure which increases spending over 
this years level by 25 billion must be reconciled with the 
version that the house passed in june 
the senate version almost exactly the same as the house total 
exceeds the administration request by nearly 600 million it was 
passed by a voice vote 
the bill contains 318 million in 1991 for the texasbased 
superconducting super collider project the same amount requested 
by the administration and granted by the house current estimates 
put the final cost for the collider at nearly 9 billion when it is 
completed in 1998 the circular project would be 54 miles long and 
would be the worlds largest atom smasher an estimate three years 
ago put the cost at 44 billion 
the 1991 appropriation includes construction funds 
more than half the money in the senate bill is set aside for 
defenserelated nuclear projects the bulk of that money goes to 
nuclear weapons research and production including 107 million for 
star wars 
the defense component also includes 27 billion to clean up 
contamination at the nations nuclear defense plants the amount is 
318 million more than the administration requested and 34 million 
less than what the house voted to spend 
estimates put the ultimate cleanup cost at 50 billion to 200 
billion over the next two decades 
the senate bill also calls for spending more than half a billion 
dollars on civilian nuclear waste management only slightly 
exceeding the administration request 
the bill contains 5 billion worth of water projects including 
63 million more than the administration requested for louisiana

an advocacy group for the elderly on thursday 
said medicare cuts under consideration by federal budget 
negotiators would hit the nations sickest and poorest senior 
citizens the hardest 
families usa a nonprofit advocacy group called the proposal 
to raise medicare premiums and deductibles a wolf in sheeps 
clothing that was being advanced because it was politically more 
acceptable than cutting social security costofliving adjustments 
the group analyzed three proposals to reduce spending on senior 
citizens that are under consideration by budget negotiators for the 
bush administration and congress 
the 12weekold budget talks are aimed at producing a 
deficitreduction package one plan under consideration would 
increase the medicare deductible on payments to physicians from 75 
to 150 and raise monthly premium rates 
phyllis torda health policy director for families usa said the 
medicare cutbacks would cost elderly beneficiaries 20 percent more 
in 1995 than a oneyear freeze in social security colas but would 
be less risky politically 
raising the cost of medicare is nothing more than a social 
security cola cut in disguise she said 
a third option under consideration would increase taxes on 
social security income for senior citizens with annual incomes of 
40000 or more families usa said this plan was the fairest of the 
three proposals 
torda said the release of the groups report was timed to 
coincide with the august congressional recess 
we think that while congress is in recess work will be going 
on on the package said torda now is the time to influence the 
shape of that package

peace corps volunteers will return to the 
philippines when their safety can be assured the corps director 
said after the release thursday of a corpsman detained for 50 days 
by filipino communist guerrillas 
timothy swanson a 26yearold volunteer from cheyenne wyo 
was released by new peoples army insurgents and he appeared to be 
physically unharmed said corps director paul coverdell 
the programs suspension june 27 was not intended to be 
permanent and i think there are valid reasons for us to begin 
discussions to find a way volunteers can return to that country in 
safety coverdell said 
however he said until we can verify that safety they cannot 
return he did not list specific conditions 
us officials suspended the philippines program after learning 
that the new peoples army had targeted volunteers for attack 
manila headquarters did not learn swanson had been abducted from 
his home in negros province on june 13 until it summoned 
participants to return to america two weeks later 
the reason for the kidnapping remains unknown coverdell said 
the peace corps began philippine operations 30 years ago until 
it abducted swanson the new peoples army left all foreign 
volunteers alone coverdell said 
their release of swanson and of fumio mizuno a detained member 
of a japanese service organization may suggest that they have 
reverted to the earlier handsoff policy he said but it is too 
early to know as yet 
meanwhile more time will be needed to activate a peace corps 
program planned for china but canceled after the june 1989 
crackdown on the prodemocracy movement coverdell said 
discussions have resumed with the chinese government but funds 
for the program were diverted to other uses when the plans were 
canceled he said 
the first peace corps volunteers will go to mongolia next year 
under an agreement signed by secretary of state james baker iii in 
ulan bator coverdell said

a suit filed today seeks to stop the 
legislature from considering a proposed measure that would require 
unmarried girls 17 and younger to get a parents consent for an 
abortion 
the suit filed by zolton ferency a state senate candidate 
maintained that the proposal is unconstitutional and asks that the 
board of state canvassers be prohibited from sending the initiative 
to the legislature 
im saying the right to keep your body healthy the right to 
seek medical care when you need it is a fundamental right nobody 
can interfere with ferency said 
but barbara listing president of right to life of michigan 
said the legal challenge is premature since the measure has not 
been acted on she said ferency one of two democrats running for a 
vacant state senate seat in next tuesdays primary filed the suit 
to help his campaign 
its a rather frivolous suit and a publicity stunt right 
before a contested primary in which hes a candidate she said 
the lawsuit filed in ingham county circuit court targets a 
measure being pushed by the right to life of michigan group which 
gathered more than 333000 signatures on petitions to put the 
proposal before the legislature 
if the board of state canvassers certifies the petitions the 
legislature will have 40 days to pass the measure or it will go 
before voters in the 1992 general election 
gov james blanchard who vetoed a similar measure earlier this 
year is barred by the state constitution from doing so to 
initiated bills 
ferencys suit relies on a section of the michigan constitution 
that says the peoples power to initiate legislation covers only 
laws that are constitutional 
ferency argued that the bill is unconstitutional because it 
treats unmarried minors differently from married minors and 
interferes with the right to seek medical care 
it also unconstitutionally violates the due process rights of 
doctors by punishing them for performing a legal medical procedure 
and interferes with a contract between a doctor and a patient for 
medical care by requiring a third partys consent ferencys suit 
argued

the soviet union iraqs main arms supplier 
decided today to suspend weapons sales to iraq in response to 
baghdads invasion of kuwait the official tass news agency said 
at the same time the united states said secretary of state 
james a baker iii would travel to moscow on friday to issue a 
joint superpower statement on the invasion which washington and 
the soviet union both condemned 
the soviet announcement about arms sales came several hours 
after the soviet union demanded that iraq withdraw its troops from 
kuwait 
iraqs forces overran kuwait after talks broke down wednesday on 
a dispute over an oilrich border area 
earlier today baker met with foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze in siberia and asked him to halt arms deliveries to 
iraq the two leaders were in the siberian city of irkutsk to 
discuss afghanistan and other issues 
after tass reported the suspension of arms sales the state 
department announced that baker had changed his travel plans and 
would fly to moscow on friday to issue the joint statement with 
shevardnadze on the iraqi invasion 
the fact that the soviet union and the united states both moved 
together against iraq shows how their relationship has improved and 
how both seem less prepared to take opposite sides in regional 
conflicts 
the soviet foreign ministry issued a statement this morning 
condemning the iraqi attack and calling for an immediate withdrawal 
of all iraqi troops but the brief tass report tonight contained 
the first response to bakers request 
tass which was quoting a second foreign ministry statement 
said sales of arms and military hardware were being interrupted 
in connection with the invasion of kuwait by iraqi armed forces 
it was the latest in a series of quick responses by governments 
that have condemned the iraqi invasion which toppled the kuwaiti 
government and put a provisional government in its place 
president bush who condemned the invasions as naked 
aggression signed orders freezing iraqi assets and kuwaiti 
assets to prevent iraq from seizing them france quickly did the 
same while britain froze kuwaiti assets 
baker spoke to reporters aboard a us air force jet en route 
from the siberian city of irkutsk to ulan bator the capital of 
mongolia where he met with that countrys leaders on an official 
visit 
the secretary said he asked shevardnadze to halt any military 
or arms deliveries that they might have in the pipeline to iraq 
baker said shevardnadze was not pleased to hear that iraqi 
forces had moved into kuwait baker said he had heard about the 
invasion just before he went into a final negotiating session with 
shevardnadze this morning 
shevardnadze told reporters on his return to moscow from irkutsk 
that every measure should be taken to end the iraqikuwait 
conflict tass said he said he would be consulting with his 
advisers and the soviet union would take all necessary measures 
that are possible

killer bees humbug its the ornery red 
imported fire ant that is threatening life and limb in the south 
these days 
and the situation keeps getting worse says the agriculture 
department in 1957 fire ants occupied about 27 million acres by 
1985 their domain was 230 million acres stretching from texas to 
virginia and puerto rico 
regina wiggen of the departments agricultural research service 
said people throughout the south have grudgingly surrendered 
ground to fire ants since the pests were first seen in the united 
states near mobile ala in 1918 
wiggen associate editor of the agencys agricultural research 
magazine wrote that fire ants are a threat to humans and 
livestock they also destroy or disfigure the landscape with their 
mounds 
in the ants wake playground and picnic areas lie abandoned 
parks disfigured golf courses churned up and cemeteries damaged 
she said no one who is hypersensitive to stinging insects should 
risk being stung 
all of this is old stuff to millions of southerners who have 
learned to look carefully where they sit or lie in the great 
outdoors but the ants may be getting antsy about moving on 
for years wiggen said scientists believed the ants have a 
limited tolerance of cold weather in their native argentina they 
dont range south of 38 degrees latitude which is comparable to 
the pests northernmost range in the united states 
but lately there has been concern that the imported red fire ant 
has been mingling with black varieties which might produce a 
coldtolerant fire ant 
isolated colonies have been spotted in arizona and california 
the december 1989 issue of nursery digest warned that once 
established in california fire ants probably will spread to much 
of the western seaboard 
the usda for many years worked with states to fight fire ants 
with chemicals and poisoned bait wiggen said that between 1957 and 
1977 millions of acres were treated with the insecticide mirex 
but without enduring avail 
now she said we know that widespread application of toxic 
chemicals may put the environment at more risk than the ants 
the magazines cover story by jessica morrison silva tells about 
the life cycle of fire ants how they threaten homeowners public 
lands and farming areas the colony is based on a queen which has 
a rather bizarre sex life 
after a virgin queen mates in midair she descends to the 
ground silva said no longer needing wings she now chews or 
breaks them off the remaining wing muscles are used as a 
nutritional source for her in establishing the new colony and in 
egg production 
parasites and other natural weapons are being examined as 
possible methods of curbing the pests scientists are seeking a 
complex of fire ant disease and natural pests that will do the job 
meanwhile africanized bees the socalled killer bees of 
hollywood fame are still moving north and may cross the 
usmexico border any time now say usda officials 
while these aggressive bee can be threatening they still only 
sting from one end the fire ant according to usda entomologists 
grabs you with its jaws and socks it to you with its tail stinger 
both the bite and sting are painful

selected overseas markets and then collect free government 
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses or subsidies 
dickerson said the latest subsidies averaged 2040 per ton or 
about 56 cents per bushel

japan heavily dependent on persian gulf oil said 
thursday it was greatly concerned by iraqs invasion of kuwait and 
urged iraq to withdraw its troops 
japan imports 99 percent of its oil and its economy has proved 
vulnerable to oil shocks sparked by middle east conflicts 
iraqs predawn invasion of kuwait drove down the japanese yen 
and sent shares plunging on the tokyo stock exchange kuwait and 
iraq between them supply 112 percent of japans oil needs 
japan deeply regrets the invasion and is watching the 
worsening situation with great concern chief government 
spokesman misoji sakamoto said 
he said japan requests the immediate retreat of the iraqi 
forces and expressed hope the issues between the two persian gulf 
neighbors could be settled without more force 
the arab oil embargo after the 1973 arabisraeli war was a 
powerful though shortterm setback to japans economic growth oil 
prices skyrocketed causing inflation and cutbacks in industrial 
production 
in the first quarter of 1990 iraq supplied japan with about 
260000 barrels of oil a day or 62 percent of its needs the 
ministry of international trade and industry said during the same 
period kuwait was the source of 210000 barrels a day or 50 
percent of japans needs it said 
trading in crude oil was chaotic in far eastern markets 
thursday bid prices climbed sharply 
as of the end of june japan had 142 days worth of oil in 
reserve an official at the trade ministry said 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity predicted oil 
prices would fluctuate in the short term but said it was too early 
to say what longterm effect there might be on japans oil imports 
on the tokyo stock exchange the widely quoted nikkei index of 
225 selected issues closed down 59281 points at 3024518 a drop 
of 192 percent for the day 
the dollar closed up 225 yen at 14890 yen in tokyo after 
trading in a wide range earlier this week the dollar had gone into 
a decline based on interestrate concerns but it moved sharply up 
on news of the middle east fighting 
earlier this year iraqi oil minister issam alchalabi visited 
tokyo seeking increased oil sales to japan he said japanese 
companies had expressed interest in helping to develop oil fields 
with expenses to be repaid in oil from the fields

south korea said thursday it would 
procede with a fiveday border opening in midaugust and that all 
citizens will be allowed to visit communist north korea if the 
north guarantees their safe return 
unification minister hong sungchul announced details of the 
aug 1317 border opening and urged north korea to support the 
historic project designed to promote unification of the divided 
peninsula 
north korea said it would send a delegation across the border 
during the fiveday period to console several prominent south 
korean dissidents jailed for allegedly promoting national 
unification 
south korean security laws ban private contacts between south 
korean citizens and north korea which seoul considers an enemy 
country 
in a nationally televised news conference hong said any of 
south koreas 42 million citizens may apply to visit the north and 
any applicants accepted and guaranteed by pyongyang authorities 
would be allowed to cross the border this was the first time south 
korea has said it would allow all citizens including dissidents 
to visit communist north korea 
we hope this would not only lead to the reunion of 
separated families but also the sharing of the emotional 
excitement by embracing each other after 45 years of separation 
hong told a news conference 
the minister said however south korean dissidents would not be 
allowed to to attend a north koreansponsored unification rally at 
the border village of panmunjom aug 15 unless they are joined by 
representatives of all walks of life 
north korea has said it will welcome only dissidents from the 
south at the rally 
in a report monitored in tokyo thursday north korea said that 
on aug 15 it would send a delegation to visit a jailed south 
korean radical student and other dissidents 
our consolatory team is going to meet and console not only im 
sugyong but also father moon gyuhyon and at the same time 
rev moon ikhwan and his family according to the norths 
official korean central news agency 
ms im a 22yearold sophomore in seoul was sentenced to five 
years in prison for making an illegal trip to north korea last 
year she said she went to the north to promote unification 
moon gyuhyon a 41yearold catholic priest and moon ikhwan 
a 72yearold protestant minister also received long prison terms 
for violating national security laws the two moons are unrelated 
there was no immediate south korean response to the north korean 
move 
the seoul announcement thursday was a followed a july 20 
proclamation by president roh taewoo calling for a fiveday border 
opening to allow free and unrestricted travel between the hostile 
koreas 
north korea effectively rejected rohs proposal by listing a set 
of preconditions unlikely to be met including releasing political 
prisoners and dismantling border walls that south korea claims do 
not exist 
the korean peninsula was divided into the communist north and 
capitalist south in 1945 and the two nations fought a war in the 
early 1950s despite sporadic dialogue aimed at reducing tensions 
they remain archenemies 
the border between the koreas is the most heavily fortified in 
the world with more than 15 million armed troops behind concrete 
bunkers and barbed wire on either side there are no telephone 
radio television or travel exchanges

the commander of soviet chemical forces says the 
soviets have a stockpile of 40000 tons of chemical weapons about 
10000 tons less than previous independent estimates 
meanwhile france on thursday proposed a highlevel meeting in 
january to chart the path to speedy agreement to ban the use 
production and stockpiling of chemical weapons the world over 
the soviet official stanislav petrov told the communist party 
newspaper pravda that all soviet chemical weapons are stored on 
soviet territory there have long been rumors that the soviets have 
chemicalweapons depots in eastern europe 
petrov confirmed to pravda there are no facilities in the soviet 
union to destroy the chemical weapons despite a superpower 
agreement to eliminate 80 percent of them immediately 
a weaponsdestruction plant was built at chapayevsk 550 miles 
southwest of moscow but was closed last summer after local 
residents complained it would add to already high pollution levels 
petrov told pravda the chapayevsk site would become a training 
center for workers who destroy chemical weapons 
the supreme soviet legislature was asked to find a safe site to 
build a replacement plant but so far no lawmaker has volunteered a 
district in which to place it 
petrov said he would like to build two destruction facilities in 
sparsely populated areas 
independent sources had previously estimated the soviet union 
had 40000 tons of chemical weapons compared with 30000 tons in 
the united states 
the french call for highlevel talks on chemical weapons came at 
the 40nation geneva conference on disarmament 
frances chief delegate pierre morel said despite earlier 
headway talks on a chemical weapons treaty had bogged down morel 
proposed that januarys meeting be held at the ministerial level to 
speed the treaty process

iraqs powerful army invaded this small oilrich 
kingdom early today tankled troops quickly seized the rulers 
palace and government buildings and the emir fled to saudi arabia 
kuwaiti officials said 
kuwaits us ambassador said the iraqis occupied all government 
buildings in the capital and were moving south toward the countrys 
oil facilities he appealed for us military intervention 
a pentagon source said us navy ships were diverted to the 
region but president bush said the subject of intervention was not 
being discussed 
the iraqis have occupied all of kuwait a kuwaiti government 
official shouted in a telephone interview diplomatic sources in 
the persian gulf estimated that more than 200 kuwaitis were killed 
or wounded 
the iraqi government of president saddam hussein claimed it 
invaded at the request of revolutionaries who had already staged a 
coup and established the provisional government of free kuwait 
kuwait and un diplomats labeled the coup report a farce 
the assault followed two weeks of tension between kuwait and 
iraq caused by iraqi accusations that kuwait stole oil from a 
disputed border area saddam also accused kuwait of exceeding opec 
production quotas thus driving down the price of oil a major 
iraqi revenue source 
the attack had wideranging ramifications 
oil prices soared 3 a barrel in early trading because of fears 
the invasion would disrupt supplies prices were about 2 higher 
later 
president bush signed orders freezing iraqi assets in the 
united states and blocking most iraqi imports including oil oil 
accounts for 97 percent of iraqi imports to the united states and 
makes up about 35 percent of us oil consumption bush also froze 
kuwaiti assets to prevent iraq from seizing them 
the soviet union iraqs main arms supplier halted weapons 
sales 
the un security council voted 140 to denounce the invasion 
and demanded immediate withdrawal of iraqi troops 
a pentagon source said the aircraft carrier uss independence 
escorted by a sixship battle group was diverted from the indian 
ocean toward the gulf where other us ships were already 
patrolling 
secretary of state james a baker iii planned to fly to moscow 
to issue a rare joint statement friday with soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze about the invasion the plan which was 
announced in washington illustrates the dramatic improvement in 
relations between the superpowers who once routinely lined up on 
opposite sides of most regional disputes 
kuwaits us ambassador sheik saud nasir alsabah told 
reporters in washington we are desperate for any help we can 
get he appealed specifically for american intervention 
in recent days diplomats said iraq had massed more than 100000 
troops at the border kuwaits entire armed forces has 20300 
soldiers 
bush said the united states would take whatever steps 
necessary to defend interests in the gulf asked if this included 
military force bush said were not discussing intervention 
but he said he would not discuss military options publicly 
it was the first time in modern history an arab nation had 
invaded another and taken over its government 
kuwaits army was no match for iraq battlehardened after eight 
years of war with iran iraq has emerged as the arab worlds 
strongest and most militant military power and saddam has a vast 
arsenal of chemical and conventional weapons 
diplomats said about 350 iraqi tanks wheeled into the capital a 
few hours after crossing the border 40 miles away at dawn 
witnesses said the bombardment of ports and military airports by 
artillery and the air force was vicious 
the invaders surrounded the palace of kuwaits ruler sheik 
jaber alahmed alsabah residents said the palace was seized after 
about two hours of heavy artillery barrages 
diplomats said sheik fahd alahmed alsabah one of the emirs 
brothers was killed while trying to defend the palace 
there were about 50 tanks around the palace and the neighboring 
american embassy residents said 
the alsabah family has ruled the citystate for almost 250 
years the kuwaiti ambassador said the leaders were safe in saudi 
arabia 
operating from an unknown location alahmeds government 
responded to the formation of the provisional government by 
stating kuwait is kuwait to its people let by the emir sheik 
jaber and his crown prince sheik saad god preserve them from all 
harm 
for its part the provisional government announced through 
baghdads official iraqi news agency that it was dissolving 
parliament and would hold free and honest elections at a future 
date 
the iraqi forces were led by the elite republican guard which 
did the brunt of fighting in the iraniraq war troops set up 
roadblocks at major intersections and shot at cars that did not 
stop 
baghdad television said iraq qould withdraw its forces within 
days or weeks depending on how quickly the situation stabilized 
kuwaits land and sea borders were closed as was the airport 
diplomats said the invasion was too swift to arrange the 
evacuation of nationals and foreigners were asked to keep a low 
profile 
there are about 4000 americans among the large expatriate 
community in kuwait where more than 60 percent of the 18 million 
residents are foreigners us officials monitoring the situation 
had no reports of harm to us citizens in iraq white house 
spokesman roman popadiuk said 
foreigners reached by telephone said they watched from their 
windows or dived for cover as the invasion began we were totally 
unprepared said catherine baker of illinois one feels like 
there should have been a bit of warning 
the british embassy was hit by shellfire and the sheraton and 
hilton hotels evacuated their clientele the diplomats said 
the invasion came hours after iraq broke off talks intended to 
mend its differences with kuwait 
iraqi first threatened military action against its former ally 
kuwait two weeks ago washington declared its support for kuwait 
from the start 
during the iraniraq war american ships protected usflagged

fishing was banned in seafoodrich 
galveston bay because of a 500000gallon oil spill and crews 
trying to raise a submerged barge closed the houston ship channel 
again today 
cleanup crews meanwhile got the goahead from the federal 
government to use oileating bacteria on the 17mile slick but 
gov bill clements said after flying over the area today that he 
does not think the microbes will be effective 
its as much a precautionary measure as anything else neil 
travis chief of the texas health departments consumer health 
protection bureau said wednesday in announcing the openended ban 
on commercial and private fishing 
the move was a blow to the seafood industry and some business 
owners threatened to sue to recoup their losses the bay is one of 
the states richest fishing grounds generating revenue estimated 
at more than 338 million a year 
everybodys wondering how in the hell theyre going to pay 
their mortgages on their boats and their businesses said walter 
jakubas owner of captain wallys marina in san leon 
the spill occurred saturday when a greek tanker collided with 
two oil barges in the houston ship channel the tanker did not lose 
any of its cargo of jet fuel but one apex towing co barge sank 
and the other was damaged 
the coast guard said today it is taking charge of cleanup 
operations 
we took over the cleanup we call the shots now and we pay the 
bills said chief warrant officer rick meidt but he said the 
coast guard will bill the towing company for the cleanup costs 
coast guard petty officer glenn rosenholm said divers have found 
a crack between two cargo tanks on the barge and numerous holes 
including one 7foot gash in the stern 
some 10000 gallons of oil was found still aboard the barge in 
one of the tanks 
rosenholm said divers put a sling under the barge in front of 
the crack to try to raise it enough to move it out of the ship 
channel 
gov bill clements met with coast guard rear adm jim loy early 
today before flying over the accident site clements who has 
declared a state emergency for the area planned to visit eagle 
point a peninsula that was doused with oil and is being used as a 
command post for cleanup crews 
rosenholm said the coast guard estimates about 50000 gallons of 
oil remained on the water throughout galveston bay today 
that does not include oil contained in the booms or picked up 
by skimmers he said thats just what remains freefloating 
more than 50000 gallons of oil had been skimmed from the bay by 
wednesday and other oil has been trapped in booms surrounding the 
spill area and sweeps used to deflect oil from sensitive marshland 
areas 
meanwhile officials from the coast guard and the national 
transportation safety board resumed a hearing today into the cause 
of the accident 
on wednesday officials heard testimony from the captain and 
helmsman aboard the shinoussa who blamed a houston ship channel 
pilot for directing them into the path of the barges the pilot 
however claimed the helmsman turned the wrong way 
state officials had hoped to begin deploying some 800 pounds of 
oileating microbes in some areas of the bay later today 
but clements who declared the bay an emergency area wednesday 
said he didnt think bioremediation would be effective on the 
17mile oil slick because it has broken up 
it is so fragmented out there theres no concentration of the 
kind of slick that you would address it to clements said 
blanton moore a representative of the texas general land 
office disagreed he said the microbes could be used on the 
remaining sheen 
it has no negative effects and can only help the bay he 
said of the process 
the naturally occurring microbes reduce the oil to a fatty 
substance that sinks and is eaten by fish when the oil is gone 
the microbes die 
earlier this summer the oileaters underwent their first 
opensea test on a small section of the 39milliongallon mega 
borg oil spill state officials said the microbes gobbled up the 
oil and caused no harm to the environment 
travis of the state health department said the fishing ban was 
imposed because shrimpers were spotted fishing in oiltainted areas 
and because oil was found on some shrimp caught in the bay 
the ban prohibits the taking of any aquatic organisms including 
fish crabs oysters and shrimp 
were at a point of extreme frustration said clifford 
hillman owner of hillman shrimp and oyster co in san leon are 
the effects of this two weeks two years or twenty years 
larry mckinney director of resource protection at the texas 
parks and wildlife department said oil settling on the bottom 
could kill small marine life a crucial link in the food chain 
and reduce the number of shrimp oysters crabs and other wildlife 
if its on the surface at least you have the chance of 
cleaning it up if it gets to the bottom theres nothing you can 
do youre stuck with it mckinney said thats when you get 
the longterm impact if it gets in the sediment it can be very 
toxic over a long period of time up to five years

for 234 years the alsabah family ruled kuwait 
but on thursday the onceproud dynasty was shattered by a lighting 
invasion by iraq 
at least one member of the royal family was reported to have 
been killed and the emir himself sheik jaber alahmed alsabah 
and his crown prince sheik saad abdullah alsabah fled to 
neighboring saudi arabia 
this is a black thursday in the annals of not only the 
alsabah dynasty but also arab solidarity one kuwaiti government 
official said speaking on condition of anonymity 
egypts middle east news agency quoted witnesses as saying sheik 
fahd alahmed alsabah the emirs brother was gunned down as he 
tried to defend the emirs palace persian gulf diplomats speaking 
on condition of anonymity later confirmed he was dead 
members of the alsabah family like other royal families in the 
rest of the gulf region fill many key posts in the government 
army police and private sector they number more than 1000 
oil has given kuwait one of the highest per capita incomes in 
the world about 20000 but this has not meant peace for the 
tiny persian gulf country of 18 million people 
the 64yearold emir sheik jaber has come in for much of the 
turbulence 
when his country gained independence from britain in 1961 he 
was named minister of finance and economy just as iraq was 
claiming sovereignty britain had to bring in troops to get the 
iraqis to back off 
by the time he moved up the ranks to prime minister crown 
prince and finally emir late 1977 kuwait was a country in the 
throes of a parliamentary crisis 
by 1980 parliament was restored and kuwait was an arab pioneer 
of westernstyle democracy 
but soon the iraqiran war broke out kuwait was a leading 
supporter of iraq bearing 15 billion of baghdads war costs 
from 1980 to 1988 kuwait was caught in between the fighting of 
two neighboring powers iraq and iran hearing the sound of gunfire 
from the front only 90 miles away 
iran dedicated to spreading its islamic revolution and angry at 
kuwait for supporting iraq attacked kuwaiti shipping lanes and oil 
facilities the united states later protected reflagged kuwaiti 
tankers in the gulf 
kuwaitis also believe iran was behind a spate of terrorism that 
began with the 1983 car bombings of us and french embassies 
seventeen proiranian shiite moslem terrorists were convicted 
for those attacks and demands for their release were hammered home 
with more attacks 
bombs were planted in downtown locations at oil installations 
and at seafront cafes in may 1985 there was a carbomb attack on 
sheik jabers life but he escaped with minor injuries 
with the end of the war the emir hoped baghdad would settle its 
longstanding border dispuate with kuwait but it never did

of kuwait as naked aggression froze control of iraqi assets in 
the united states and blocked almost all imports from the oilrich 
middle eastern country 
bush demanded that iraq withdraw its troops but said military 
intervention was not under discussion nonetheless the pentagon 
ordered the aircraft carrier uss independence and a sixship battle 
group toward the strifetorn persian gulf 
with kuwaits royal family in exile the kingdoms ambassador to 
washington pleaded for help 
we dont have a chance if we dont get any aid from our 
friends saud nasir alsabah told reporters us intervention 
at this stage is of paramount importance 
the chief us military presence in the gulf is the eightship 
joint task force middle east led by the command ship uss lasalle 
battleready marines are stationed on the supersecret diego garcia 
base in the indian ocean but moving their equipment would require 
at least 10 days a military source said 
the bush administration rejected as a patent fraud the iraqi 
claim that the invasion came at the behest of an interim kuwaiti 
government we just cant accept that kind of explanation said 
state department spokesman richard boucher 
after pleas from us officials the soviet union said it would 
cut off arms shipments to iraq us and soviet officials scheduled 
a joint declaration on the war for friday in moscow 
bushs condemnation of the invasion won general endorsement in 
congress the house quickly passed a bill 4160 embodying and 
toughening bushs economic sanctions 
the only criticism of the president came from lawmakers who said 
he should have acted earlier 
bush said he had not been taken totally by surprise by the 
invasion we had good intelligence and our intelligence has had 
me concerned for some time now he said 
government officials who would not be identified by name said 
the united states was told of the invasion at 830 pm washington 
time wednesday about 3 hours after it began 
bushs early morning order cut off virtually all commerce 
between the united states and iraq the only exceptions were 
publications and shipments to iraq of donated food clothing and 
medical supplies 
later in the day he issued a memorandum to agency heads barring 
any financial assistance loan guaratnees or export license to iraq 
iraq and kuwait together supply less than 10 percent of us oil 
imports according to us industry officials however the 
instability is certain to affect domestic oil prices 
bush summoned reporters before an early morning meeting with his 
top national security advisers and said he was viewing the middle 
east tumult with utmost gravity 
we remain committed to take whatever actions are necessary to 
defend our longstanding vital interests in the persian gulf 
bush said adding that his advisers would consider all possible 
options available to us 
lt gen howard graves of the us joint chiefs of staff 
traveling in mongolia with secretary of state james a baker iii 
said the united states was considering political military or 
economic moves against iraq pentagon sources identified one 
option as assisting evacuation of 3000 americans from kuwait 
bush said he would cut short a trip to aspen colo for a visit 
with british prime minister margaret thatcher and return to 
washington thursday night 
defense secretary dick cheney decided not to go to aspen to 
remain in washington and baker headed for moscow for a joint 
announcement with the soviets 
the state department said at midday that all 270 us embassy 
personnel in kuwait were safe and that the embassy grounds had not 
been penetrated during the fighting the department acknowledged 
that one option under consideration was withdrawal of the us 
ambassador from iraq but added that ambassador april glaspie had 
left the country for vacation before the invasion an indication 
the united states did not take seriously iraqs threatening buildup 
along the kuwaiti border 
in congress there was widespread condemnation of the invasion 
and house speaker thomas s foley said the house would vote to 
impose sanctions against iraq the house foreign affairs committee 
met in special session to write bushs executive order into law 
foley declined to criticize bush for resisting earlier sanctions 
against iraq but sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the 
senate foreign relations committee said if bush had acted earlier 
after iraq had used gas against some of its own citizens during the 
war with iran iraqi president saddam hussein may have gotten the 
message that his lawlessness would not be tolerated 
ambassador saud nasir alsabah of kuwait told reporters here 
we are desperate for any help we can get 
experts said bush harbored few easy military options to bolster 
his condemnation of the iraqi invasion 
were not discussing intervention bush said but 
acknowledged i would not discuss it publicly if i were 
in announcing his economic sanctions against iraq bush 
expressed concern about how the invasion would affect us oil 
supplies the united states imports about half its oil the boycott 
against iraq is certain to affect domestic oil prices 
according to a house foreign affairs subcommittee the united 
states imports more than 3 billion in goods annually from iraq 97 
percent of the total is oil 
the executive order also froze kuwait property under us 
jurisdiction a move intended to keep iraq from seizing it bush 
urged other nations to take similar measures and called on moscow 
to suspend arms shipments to baghdad 
the state department advised americans to postpone travel to 
kuwait 
bush said his advisers would explore a range of options 
including a request for unspecified action by the united nations 
the united states strongly condemns the iraqi military 
invasion of kuwait and calls for the immediate and unconditional 
withdrawal of all the iraqi forces bush said there is no 
place for this sort of naked aggression in todays world 
sen sam nunn dga and chairman of the senate armed services 
committee told nbc news that he doesnt believe the united states 
has a military option at the moment nor do we have a treaty 
obligation 
i believe that our primary recourse should be very intensive 
diplomatic activity he said we ought to put the burden on the 
nations in that region to bring to bear all the diplomatic and 
economic power 
william j crowe retired chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
described the level of danger in the middle east as very high 
he told abc the us military could not play a significant role 
unless invited by saudi arabia and given access to saudi military 
facilities 
even before the invasion congress had been pressuring bush to 
impose new sanctions on iraq over its belligerent moves toward 
mideast neighbors 
iraq had moved about 100000 troops to its border with kuwait 
after claiming that kuwaits production of oil beyond quotas of the 
opec cartel had depressed the world price thus diminishing iraqs 
revenue and that kuwait had been stealing oil from a field that 
straddles the border 
iraqi officials on wednesday walked out on talks in jiddah 
saudi arabia aimed at resolving the 2weekold crisis and 
complained that kuwait was not negotiating seriously

the mood at the embassies of two warring 
middle east nations was a study in contrasts thursday as kuwaits 
ambassador pleaded for outside assistance and the iraqi envoy 
defiantly defended his countrys invasion of kuwait 
we dont stand a chance if we dont get any aid from our 
friends a somber saud nasser alsabah the kuwaiti ambassador 
told reporters in an ornate chamber of his embassy 
alsabah a member of kuwaits ruling family asked the united 
states to intervene militarily to help his oilrich emirate repulse 
iraqi troops who invaded on wednesday 
as alsabah spoke of deaths in kuwait and the countrys efforts 
to resist a member of the staff wiped tears from his eyes and 
muffled a sob 
we are desperate for any help we can get he said 
describing his plea as a universal cry for help 
alsabah said kuwaits leader is directing the resistance from 
saudi arabia but that his country is under occupation by iraqi 
forces 
hours later iraqi ambassador mohamed sadiq almashat summoned 
reporters to his embassy where he said any foreign interference 
will only aggravate the situation 
surrounded by aides almashat stood in front of a lifesize 
picture of iraqi president saddam hussein the ambassador 
disregarded two power failures that occurred during his remarks 
contradicting kuwaiti claims to the contrary the iraqi envoy 
insisted that the interim free government installed after the 
invasion has asked the iraqi government to extend assistance for 
the maintenance of law and order 
almashat said iraqi forces will be withdrawn as soon as the 
situation is settled down and as soon as the free government of 
kuwait has so wished 
he refused to answer questions choosing instead to read a 
fiveparagraph statement 
both ambassadors said they had been in contact with bush 
administration officials but neither shed any light on the us 
response 
bush condemned the invasion but said he was not considering 
military intervention 
defense department sources said the aircraft carrier 
independence was en route toward the persian gulf from the indian 
ocean to bolster us forces in the middle east but would not 
actually enter gulf waters

a frail repentant roswell gilbert 
regained his freedom thursday after spending more than 5 years in 
prison for the 1985 mercy killing of his ailing wife 
the 81yearold gilbert acknowledged publicly for the first time 
that he was wrong to kill his wife of 51 years who suffered from 
alzheimers disease and osteoporosis 
i shouldnt have killed my wife now i know that said 
gilbert whose case focused national attention on the killing of an 
ailing loved one 
its difficult to explain to anyone who hasnt been through 
this trauma a mental trauma really said gilbert 
he said his wifes illness created just a complete state of 
desperation in my mind its a lousy excuse but thats what it 
was 
gilbert shot his wife emily twice with a 9mm luger in march 
1985 in their fort lauderdale apartment he was serving a mandatory 
minimum prison term of 25 years on a murder conviction when he was 
granted clemency on humanitarian grounds wednesday by gov bob 
martinez and the florida cabinet 
gilbert who suffers from heart and lung disease wants to 
regain some of the 40 pounds he lost in prison and recoup my 
health 
he chuckled at reports that his death may be imminent 
im a tough old rooster dont believe it said gilbert 
who said he would probably ignore his daughters pleas to stop 
smoking 
daddy has very bad emphysema and one of the main things im 
going to do is really insist he quit smoking said daughter 
martha skipper moran the gilberts only child 
the retired engineer was examined in january and a medical 
report showed he suffered from heart and lung disease and was 
considered at high risk of death at any time because of his 
age and physical condition 
gilbert who left the north florida reception center with a 
handful of possessions in a small brown paper bag described prison 
as a human zoo 
its been plain awful for a freedomloving person like 
myself he said 
besides a hamburger a shot of bourbon and a nice soft bed 
gilbert said he was looking forward to seeing his three grown 
grandchildren soon 
i havent had a good look at them for a long time he said 
he left the prison for a friends home in an undisclosed 
location his daughter said she expected him to resettle in fort 
lauderdale 
the lawyer who prosecuted gilbert at the murder trial kelly 
hancock said he was relieved that the state decided to free 
gilbert 
his health is deteriorated and i think his release puts to an 
end a very very tragic case a case that made us all more aware 
of the problems of the sick and the elderly have said hancock 
whos now in private practice and publicly sought gilberts release 
in recent weeks 
actor robert young who portrayed gilbert in a 1987 television 
movie mercy or murder also said he was elated with the news 
of gilberts clemency 
thats sensational said the 83yearold young best known 
for his roles in the tv series father knows best and marcus 
welby md 
although the two men never met young said he spoke with gilbert 
many times by telephone 
we had wonderful chats said young there was no selfpity 
in him at all it was a remarkable experience for me to play the 
role and get to know the man 
mrs moran who lives in baltimore said she believes her mother 
would say its about time they let him out

two democratic senators opened a new skirmish 
in the war over abortion thursday saying they want to reverse a 
regulation that bans abortions in military hospitals 
sens tim wirth of colorado and john glenn of ohio planned to 
try to add the amendment to reverse the 2yearold rule to the 
defense department authorization bill for fiscal 1991 the bill is 
being debated in the senate 
they said the rule banning abortions except when the life of 
the mother is endangered has caused tragic hardship for some us 
service personnel and their families 
why should a whole group of americans who happen to be in 
service be treated like secondclass citizens wirth asked 
the amendment he said was triggered by the story of charles 
and kaoru zwierzynski who appeared with the senators at a news 
conference 
the couple went to a japanese hospital last year when a navy 
hospital said it couldnt perform an abortion despite a diagnosis 
that the fetus was severely deformed 
we really went through hell mrs zwierzynski said it was 
the worst thing that has happened in my life 
zwierzynski is a petty officer on the uss midway which was in 
japan mrs zwierzynskis fetus had major organs forming outside 
its body and a malformed heart 
physicians including one at the us military hospital said 
the fetus had no chance of survival and recommended an abortion 
because the military hospital was banned from abortions the 
couple went to a japanese doctor and used their savings to pay 
2400 for an abortion it was mrs zwierzynskis first pregnancy 
the amendment would require that us military personnel and 
their dependents who are stationed outside the united states be 
able to obtain any reproductive health service in military 
hospitals abortions for which federal funds are not permitted to 
be used would have to be paid for by the individual 
the prohibition was imposed in 1988 by the reagan administration 
and was left in force by the bush administration the amendment is 
being sought by abortionrights groups including planned 
parenthood federation 
doug johnson legislative director for the national right to 
life committee said opponents would try to block the amendment and 
were focusing their efforts on trying to deny supporters the 60 
votes they need to cut off opponents debate 
we think every baby even those with severe handicaps ought 
to be allowed their allotted lifespan johnson said 
rep les aucoin dore an abortionrights leader in the house 
said he would try to offer a similar amendment when the defense 
bill comes to the house floor in september 
he said his amendment would provide a new test for the strength 
of abortionrights forces which last year won passage of 
exemptions in the ban on federally funded abortions to cover cases 
of rape and incest but were unable to override president bushs 
veto of the measure

more than six out of 10 black infants in the 
united states are born to unmarried mothers indicating a risk for 
health problems federal health officials said thursday 
among all races 24 percent of infants were born to unmarried 
women in 1987 the latest year for which statistics are available 
thats up sixfold from 1950 the national centers for disease 
control said in reporting the findings 
the disproportionate percentage of black infants born to 
unmarried mothers 62 percent compared to 17 percent of white 
infants represents an escalating trend in 1983 59 percent of 
black births were to single mothers compared to 13 percent of 
white births the cdc said 
these figures are alarming said evelyn lowery president of 
sclc women a familyissues arm of the southern christian 
leadership conference the problems are not getting better 
theyre getting worse 
the atlantabased cdc in its weekly report said single 
motherhood is a signal of possible health problems for the child 
not a direct cause 
marital status confers neither risk nor protection to the 
infant the cdc said rather the principal benefits of 
marriage to infant survival are economic and social support 
us infant mortality rates are higher for infants born to 
unmarried mothers than for children of marriage for both whites 
and blacks the cdc said citing new analysis of 1983 statistics 
for whites the infant mortality rate was 131 per 1000 children 
of unmarried mothers compared to 78 for children of married 
mothers for blacks the nonmarriage infant mortality rate was 
196 compared to 146 for children of married women 
our effort at teen pregnancy education has got to continue 
said mrs lowery the wife of sclc president joseph lowery many 
of these young people are themselves from single parent homes 
young black women have been especially affected by cutbacks in 
educational aid and in work programs and this impacts as well 
as the economy the teenage pregnancy problem she said 
theyre out there on the loose 
the benefits of marriage may not be there for babies born to 
teenagers even if the mothers are married the cdc said 
mortality rates for infants of married mothers under 18 tend to be 
even worse than for unmarried mothers under 18 probably because of 
a severe lack of economic and social support in struggling teen 
marriages the cdc said 
married teenagers are more likely to establish 
independent households thereby estranging themselves from 
financial and childcare support from relatives the agency said 
but in general unmarried mothers often are poor and adverse 
pregnancy outcomes are correlated with poverty conditions the 
cdc said 
the census bureau has reported that 36 percent of black families 
with a child under 18 are classified as living in poverty compared 
to 12 percent of similar white families

president bush on thursday called for 
iraq to withdraw its invading armies from kuwait and said he would 
not rule out direct us military intervention in the conflict 
bush denounced iraqs move as naked aggression and said he 
wants to see the restoration of the kuwaiti leaders to their 
rightful place 
the president spoke at a news conference with british prime 
minister margaret thatcher near aspen colo several hours after 
he signed an order freezing control of iraqi assets in the united 
states and blocking almost all imports from the oilrich middle 
eastern country 
thatcher called on iraq to heed the united nations security 
councils call for a withdrawal we need a collective and 
effective will of the nations belonging to the un to resolve 
the conflict she said 
speaking of iraqi president saddam hussein thatcher said we 
find his behavior intolerable 
bush said he had talked by telephone during the day with 
egyptian president hosni mubarak and other arab leaders and said 
he was encouraged by their efforts to find an arab answer to 
the problem 
he also noted approvingly that the soviets had cut off military 
supplies to iraq and that secretary of state james a baker iii 
would stop in moscow on his way back to the united states from asia 
he would not be stopping in moscow unless there would be a 
good degree of cooperation between the soviet union and the united 
states he said 
asked about a plea from kuwaits ambassador for military 
assistance the president said it would be inappropriate to discuss 
options 
he added were not ruling any options in but were not ruling 
any options out 
bushs reply was a slight departure from his answer to a similar 
question a few hours earlier in washington then he said he was 
not discussing military steps 
in washington american officials said it would be difficult for 
the united states to mount an effective military response anytime 
soon 
bush was asked about reports that americans working in kuwait 
were being rounded up by iraqi forces 
i dont have anything on that right now secondly it would 
affect us in a very dramatic way because i view a fundamental 
responsibility of my presidency is protecting american citizens if 
theyre put into harms way i have certain responsibilities bush 
said 
ms thatcher denounced the invasion and said it would be 
totally unacceptable if it were allowed to endure there would be 
many other small countries that would never feel safe 
the two leaders met near aspen colorado the meeting had been 
scheduled to discuss the changing face of europe and western 
security needs in the postcold war ear but it undoubtedly turned 
as well to iraqs overnight invasion of its middle eastern neighbor 
the president was flying back to washington later in the day 
rather than spend the night in colorado as originally planned

the kremlin suspended arms sales to iraq thursday 
and secretary of state james a baker iii said he would join 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze in moscow to condemn iraqs 
invasion of kuwait 
a joint statement from the united states and the soviet union 
demanding iraqs immediate withdrawal from kuwait combined with 
their sanctions would mark highly unusual superpower cooperation 
toward stopping a war 
the soviet union is iraqs major supplier of weapons 
the official soviet news agency tass announced the soviet 
decision to suspend arms sales to iraq whose millionman army 
overran kuwait which has a force estimated at 20000 
almost all of iraqs 5500 tanks most of its 500 warplanes 
most missiles and much of its artillery are soviet said hans 
binnerndijk of the londonbased international institute for 
strategic studies iraq also has about 100 french mirage jets 
binnendijk said 
soviet television showed soviet warplanes apparently mig29s 
mig25s and sukhoi fighters flying over the desert city of 
kuwait it showed sovietbuilt tanks driving across sand and iraqi 
soldiers holding sovietdesigned kalashnikov automatic rifles 
the film clip also showed blurred shots of damaged buildings 
the announcer did not say however if the film was shot thursday 
on friday baker is expected to arrive in moscow where he will 
sign the joint statement with shevardnadze according to state 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
baker on thursday arrived in the mongolian capital ulan bator 
the last stop on a fournation asian tour he traveled there from 
the siberian city of irkutsk where shevardnadze and baker were 
meeting when they learned of the iraqi attack 
as he flew from irkutsk to mongolia thursday afternoon baker 
told reporters he had asked shevardnadze to halt any military or 
arms deliveries that they might have in the pipeline to iraq 
in washington president bush immediately froze control of iraqi 
assets in the united states and blocked almost all imports from the 
oilrich middle eastern country 
baker had said shevardnadze was not pleased to hear that iraqi 
forces had moved into kuwait 
the soviet foreign ministry in moscow condemned the iraqi attack 
and urged an immediate withdrawal of all iraqi troops from kuwait 
upon his return to moscow shevardnadze told reporters every 
measure should be taken to extinguish the conflict according to 
tass he said the soviet union would take all possible measures 
less than five hours later tass announced the suspension of 
arms sales 
shevardnadze contacted baker through the soviet ambassador in 
the mongolian capital baker spoke by telephone with president 
bush and the two decided baker would fly to moscow mrs tutwiler 
said 
the soviet union temporarily suspended its sales of arms to iraq 
after the iraniraq war broke out in 1980 and took a neutral 
position in the war but western intelligence sources said the 
soviets later resumed the arms shipments the iraqis strapped 
boosters onto the shortrange scudb missiles bought from the 
soviets so they could use them to bomb tehran the iranian capital 
iraq makes its own soviet t72 tanks under license last year 
it was reported negotiatin aid in establishing its own facility for 
building warplanes including the soviet mig29 
the soviet union sold iraq 2347 billion in weapons between 
1982 and 1989 according to a publication of the us congressional 
research service 
that is about 55 percent of the total arms purchased by iraq in 
that period said the book called trends in conventional arms 
transfers to the third world by major supplier 198289 
iraq imported nearly 2 billion in arms last year and the 
soviets were their major supplier the book said

longtime soviet client state in the first visit of a top american 
official since 1944 
but baker announced he would cut short his visit by two days and 
on friday fly to moscow where he and soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze will issue a joint statement condemning iraqs 
invasion of kuwait 
baker had planned to take a private hunting and fishing trip in 
the gobi desert 
although it really breaks my heart to say this i think i 
should return home but maybe this will give me an excuse to return 
to mongolia he said at a mongolian government banquet 
baker said he made his decision after conferring with president 
bush the banquet began an hour late apparently because of the 
lengthy phone call 
during a short speech at the banquet baker praised mongolias 
recent democratic reforms which include freemarket reforms and 
multiparty elections 
your government and your people are moving forward together 
toward a common goal of greater democracy greater protection of 
human rights and economic reform he said you have joined many 
countries around the world on the road to reform 
after arriving thursday baker signed an agreement to send peace 
corps volunteers to teach english along with accords on trade and 
consular services 
he also attended a festival of mongolian culture and watched 
mongolian wrestling horse races and an archery competition he 
shot three arrows himself two came close to the target and one 
fell far short 
i couldnt even pull it back he joked pointing to the bow 
baker on a fournation asian tour arrived from irkutsk in the 
soviet union where he and soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze discussed a third ussoviet summit arms control and 
the civil war in afghanistan 
at a joint news conference shevardnadze said the soviet union 
would cease production of its railbased mobile intercontinental 
ballistic missile the ss24 the united states does not deploy 
such missiles and their presence in the soviet arsenal has been an 
impediment to ussoviet strategic arms talks 
in ulan bator baker held successive meetings with president 
punsalmaagiin ochirbat prime minister sharavyn gunjaadorg and 
communist party chairman gombojavyn ochirbat the two ochirbats are 
unrelated 
we are very heartened by the peaceful emergence of democracy 
in mongolia he said before talks with the president we have 
expressed our desire to continue to support political and economic 
reforms in mongolia 
mongolia held its first multiparty elections ever on sunday the 
communists agreed to give the opposition a role in the cabinet 
after it won a significant presence in the legislature 
baker also planned to meet with opposition leaders 
assistant secretary of state richard solomon and mongolias 
deputy foreign minister olzvoi initialed a trade agreement with 
an understanding in principle to exchange mostfavored nation 
trade status a state department news release said the agreement 
will not be signed until after further talks the mongolians are 
eager to obtain the trade status they also want us investment 
and loans to help develop their stagnant economy as they embark on 
a program of freemarket reforms 
baker is the first highlevel administration figure to visit 
mongolia since 1944 when vice president henry wallace came on his 
way from china to irkutsk at the time the united states and 
soviet union were world war ii allies 
the onset of the cold war however halted most usmongolian 
contacts diplomatic relations were established only in 1987 
for too long americans and mongolians have been strangers 
baker said at the banquet now we have the opportunity to become 
friends 
the mongoliansoviet alliance began in 1921 when the soviet red 
army helped a small band of mongolian revolutionaries oust their 
chinese overlords since then moscow has stationed troops in 
mongolia and been its chief source of economic aid 
moscow plans to withdraw all its troops by 1992 and is reducing 
aid and investment mongolian officials say they want better 
relations with the united states and other western countries

rebels turned their backs on president 
samuel does troops on thursday and prepared to fight each other a 
source close to guerrilla leader prince johnson said 
diplomats said the rivalry between johnson and his foe charles 
taylor could prolong this west african nations 7monthold civil 
war for weeks 
johnsons fighters withdrew thursday from key positions they 
have occupied in central monrovia 
that leaves the capital open to renewed occupation by does 
soldiers who massacred up to 600 men women and children sunday in 
an attack on st peters lutheran church those killed were among 
thousands of civilians who have sought sanctuary at churches and 
embassies from tribal reprisals by troops and rebels 
hundreds of civilians again started fleeing from the city 
wednesday 
only a few fighters of johnsons independent patriotic front 
were visible in areas of downtown monrovia which they captured 
from does troops earlier in the week 
gunfire broke out in parts of the city that were firmly under 
johnsons control on wednesday 
a big fire occurred in eastern monrovia but it was unclear 
whether the blaze was touched off by the fighting the fire raged 
out of control because there is no longer a fire brigade in the 
capital 
monrovias 500000 residents have been without running water 
electricity and food supplies for nearly a month 
an american who has lived in liberia for years and claims to be 
close to johnson said the rebel leader was turning his forces 
around to confront taylors troops who were advancing from behind 
him 
like the other sources the american spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
johnson broke with taylor and his national patriotic front in 
february and accuses his rival of being a libyan stooge and a 
communist johnson has said he does not share taylors aspirations 
to lead liberia 
taylor appears to have the larger of the two rebel forces but 
johnson struck into the capital earlier in the bid to unseat doe 
who is holed up in his heavily fortified executive mansion 
no faction has established clear superiority and its not at 
all clear that there will be an early end to the conflict one 
diplomat said 
in the fighting since rebels invaded from neighboring ivory 
coast last december about 5000 people have been killed most of 
them civilians 
the insurgents accuse doe of corruption and human rights abuses 
he has ruled this west african nation of more than 2 million people 
since taking power in a 1980 coup 
johnson told reporters on wednesday that he would be prepared to 
discuss with taylor a joint attack on doe if both rebel forces were 
in a position to advance on the presidential mansion but taylors 
troops remained blocked by government troops six miles from the 
city center 
johnson also said he would welcome a un peacekeeping force in 
liberia 
we are not going to fight a neutral force he said we 
would lay down our arms and let the neutral people carry on their 
peacekeeping operation 
he held his news conference at his headquarters on suburban 
bushrod island the reporters car came under fire on its way back 
from there first from the rebels then from government troops 
troops loyal to doe kept control of the defense ministry in 
streetfighting wednesday and of areas east of it leading to the 
executive mansion and barclay training center the finance 
ministry the national bank and the telecommunications center on 
wednesday were under control of rebels led by johnson

attorney general dick thornburgh said thursday 
that the justice department will pursue all allegations of savings 
and loan fraud but he declined to comment on a report that the fbi 
is seeking evidence of political influencepeddling in 1988 sampl 
bailout deals 
the los angeles times reported thursday that the fbi was 
investigating allegations of political favoritism in selecting 
buyers for dozens of failed sampls in deals which involved billions 
of dollars in federal subsidies 
while refusing to comment directly on that report thornburgh 
told the senate banking committee any allegations of wrongdoing 
that relate to past or present conduct will be vigorously pursued 
the newspaper quoting knowledgeable sources said that for 
at least a month the fbi has been conducting a major investigation 
in connection with the 1988 deals made by the federal home loan 
bank board which was dismantled by last years sampl legislation 
that legislation also required the federal deposit insurance 
corp to review the deals to see whether the government could save 
money by exercising contract options 
l william seidman fdic chairman told reporters after 
appearing before the senate panel we look in every instance for 
any kind of illegal activity 
the fdics report is due at the end of this month the agency is 
estimating the transactions including deals covering 87 failed 
texas thrifts will cost the government 52 billion over the next 
decade 
asked if the fdic was cooperating with the fbi on the matter 
seidman said i assume we are i have not looked into it im 
sure we are working with them on every case in which there is 
alleged illegality 
the times quoted an unidentified federal regulator who said an 
fbi agent had offered him immunity from prosecution in exchange for 
testimony on the deals the regulator told the newspaper that some 
of the transactions went through after upperlevel federal 
officials overruled lowerlevel officials who opposed the deals 
marvin collins us attorney in dallas said in a telephone 
interview that he could not comment on specific investigations but 
he said we in the us attorneys office in dallas and in the 
dallas bank fraud task force will follow evidence of criminal 
wrongdoing wherever it may lead 
m danny wall who served as chairman of the bank board said in 
a telephone interview that he had no indication whatsoever that 
the fbi was investigating the 1988 deals and said they were not 
politically influenced 
im confident the senior people involved made the best 
decisions based on the information available he said 
the newspapers sources would not identify which deals were 
under investigation by a special fraud task force headquartered in 
dallas but said not all of the deals were suspect 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio has been conducting an inquiry 
into one of the deals the consolidation of 15 failed texas thrifts 
into bluebonnet savings bank in dallas 
metzenbaum is asking whether gop lobbyist robert thompson an 
aide to president bush when he was vice president improperly 
exerted his influence in helping arizona insurance executive james 
fail acquire bluebonnet 
separately the senate judiciary committee on thursday 
unanimously adopted a motion to begin the process of enforcing its 
subpoena against thompson who failed to appear for a july 31 
subcommittee session the motion directs thompson to appear at an 
aug 6 session or risk being held in contempt of congress

us rep floyd flake was indicted thursday on 
conspiracy and fraud charges alleging he embezzled thousands of 
dollars from his church and a related senior citizens housing 
project 
the indictment lists 17 counts against flake a 45yearold 
ordained minister and nine against his wife margarett 42 for 
activities between 1983 and 1989 
it alleged that flake a democrat who represents new yorks 6th 
congressional district illegally diverted a total of 141700 from 
church and housing funds to his own use and failed to report it as 
taxable income 
flake denied the charges and a lawyer for mrs flake said they 
added credence to the idea that evenhanded treatment is not 
being accorded to minority politicians 
flake is pastor of the 156yearold allen african methodist 
church in queens which built the 300unit allen senior citizens 
apartments in 1981 with a 10 million federal loan 
the church operates the complex with a 100000 monthly subsidy 
from the department of housing and urban development the 
indictment charged that between 1983 and 1987 the flakes embezzled 
75000 from the complex 
us attorney andrew maloney said the money was siphoned off in 
6000 increments from quarterly hud allocations of 9000 set 
aside for transporting senior citizen residents of the center on 
local business he said the actual transportation costs were only 
3000 a quarter 
the indictment alleged that flake took an additional 66700 
from a special church ministerial expense fund account for his 
own use between 1983 and 1988 again not reporting the money as 
taxable income 
maloney said the churchs 6000 parishoners apparently were 
unaware of the alleged theft because the special account was 
managed by the flakes themselves 
flakes attorney gustave newman said the money was used for 
church purposes and the charges would not stand up in court 
newman also said the case would not affect flakes plans to seek 
reelection to a third term in the house this year 
ted wells mrs flakes lawyer described his client as really 
only a secretary who signed tax forms and checks but had no 
substantive involvement in the operations 
the charges included one count of conspiracy two of fraud and 
six of tax evasion against each of the two defendants in addition 
flake is charged with four counts of filing false tax returns and 
four of making false financial statements 
if convicted on all 17 counts flake could be sentenced to a 
maximum of 87 years in prison and fined up to 395 million his 
wife could face penalties of 55 years in prison and fines of up to 
21 million 
wells accused maloney of furthering what he said was a pattern 
of unfair prosecutions against minority politicians 
this indictment is unfair treatment of a minority female and 
by treating her this way you just add fuel to the fire that 
prosecutors are not handling these cases in an evenhanded 
fashion he said

women with family histories of serious genetic 
disorders now can have their embryos screened in the testtube 
before they are implanted into the womb a doctor said thursday who 
pioneered the technique 
dr alan handyside said the technique has been used only to 
determine gender but researchers at the royal postgraduate medical 
school at hammersmith hospital hope the process can be refined to 
detect other genetic information 
handyside said the technique has produced its first children 
he said he and his colleagues are screening women with a family 
history of socalled xlinked defects that strike only boys in 
these cases only female embryos are implanted into the mother 
the new procedure builds on techniques developed for invitro 
fertilization and prenatal testing handyside said from the west 
london hospital 
like invitro fertilization eggs removed from the mother are 
fertilized in a test tube where the embryos are allowed to grow for 
three days handyside said 
you cannot implant an embryo beyond the third day so we begin 
work early in the third day when the embryo has multiplied to eight 
cells handyside said 
he said there is a 12hour window for completing the screening 
a single cell removed from the microscopic eightcell embryo is 
amplified and analyzed to determine whether it is male or female 
the first children born after the screening process were twins 
natalie and danielle edwards the girls born two weeks ago were 
five weeks premature but are healthy and growing handyside said 
the mother debbie edwards approached the hammersmith hospital 
team after learning she carried the gene for adrenoleukodystrophy 
a fatal disease similar to muscular dystrophy handyside said 
debbies sister also carries the gene and has an 11yearold boy 
who was stricken at eight and is now totally disabled 
six other couples have gone through the program and are 
expecting girls handyside said the mothers carry the gene for any 
of 200 diseases including hemophilia duchenne muscular dystrophy 
and adrenoleukodystrophy all affect male children handyside said 
traditional prenatal screening takes cells from the placenta in 
the first 810 weeks of pregnancy and if genetic defects are 
detected a women can opt for an abortion 
screening before an embryo is implanted reduces the risk of a 
woman becoming infertile after repeated abortions handyside said 
in addition for families that risk passing on serious genetic 
disease to males the embryo procedure should be less emotionally 
trying than an abortion said dr kathleen nolan a pediatrician 
and ethicist at the hastings center in briarcliff manor ny 
since no one had removed a single cell from a 3dayold embryo 
before handyside said there were initial concerns 
we had no direct evidence but every animal and mammal we 
looked at was able to regulate for removal of cells at early 
stages the embryologist said 
handyside said the embryo has a natural defense mechanism that 
allows growth to continue normally 
it appears to be a response to damage which could happen in 
the reproductive tract he said

here is the text of remarks by president 
bush and british prime minister margaret thatcher as they met with 
reporters on thursday the first set of remarks came during a photo 
opportunity the second set was from a news conference held later 
q have you ruled out military intervention in the gulf mr 
president 
bush no terry listen heres the ground rules were going to 
have a press scrumavailability afterward with the prime minister 
and be glad to respond to questions this is what they call a photo 
opportunity and no questions will be entertained 
q but theres a deadline every minute sir 
q for the sake of those british television stations who are 
running out of time mr president could we just have one word 
bush not now but well be glad to stay by the ground rules 
here 
mrs thatcher it wont be long 
bush it wouldnt be fair to those who arent here yet for the 
press availability 
q have you frozen iraqi assets mrs thatcher 
bush hes having trouble hearing 
q were you able to make contact sir with any middle eastern 
leaders as you indicated you wanted to can you tell us if you 
spoke to 
bush im not going to take any questions its not it really 
isnt fair charles to those who have been told that the press 
conference will be in an hour and some minutes o really we have 
to abide by that but its been very interesting very active 
staff thank you all 
q we havent had a chance mr president to hear what mrs 
thatcher has said at all 
bush well 
mrs thatcher dont worry youll hear later 
q it will be too late for us i fear referring again to 
british television deadline 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
bush well let me first welcome prime minister thatcher back to 
the united states its a very timely visit and as you can well 
imagine 
audio break 
not surprisingly i find myself very much in accord with the 
views of the prime minister i reported to her on contacts that 
ive had since i left washington personal contacts with king 
hussein mr mubarak of egypt president mubarak president salih 
of yemen a long conversation just now i can tell you that jim 
baker has been in close touch with the soviet leadership and 
indeed the last plan was for him to stop in moscow on his way back 
here 
we are concerned about the situation but i find that prime 
minister thatcher and i are looking at it on exactly the same 
wavelength concerned about this naked aggression condemning it 
and hoping that a peaceful solution will be found that will result 
in the restoration of the kuwaiti leaders to their rightful place 
and prior to that a withdrawal of iraqi forces 
prime minister welcome to colorado and to the united states 
and if you care to say a word on that then we can take the 
questions 
mrs thatcher thank you mr president and thank you for the 
welcome 
we have of course been discussing the main question as the 
president indicated iraq has violated and taken over the territory 
of a country which is a full member of the united nations that is 
totally unacceptable and if it were allowed to endure then there 
would be many other small countries that could never feel safe the 
security council acted swiftly last night under united states 
leadership well supported by the votes of 14 members of the 
security council and rightly demanded the withdrawal of iraqi 
troops if that withdrawal is not swiftly forthcoming we have to 
consider the next step the next step would be further 
consideration by the security council of possible measures under 
chapter 7 
the fundamental question is this whether the nations of the 
world have the collective will effectively to see that security 
council resolution is upheld whether they have the collective will 
effectively to do anything which the security council further 
agrees to see that iraq withdraws and that the government of kuwait 
is restored to kuwait none of us can do it separately we need a 
collective and effective will of the nations belonging to the 
united nations first the security council and then the support of 
all the others to make it effective 
q mr president when kuwaiti shipping was in danger in the 
gulf war you put those ships under american flag now kuwait 
itself has been invaded the kuwaiti ambassador says that theyre 
desperate for help and that american intervention is of paramount 
importance will you answer that call and how will you 
bush i answer that were considering what the next steps by the 
united states should be just as we strongly support what prime 
minister thatcher said about collective action in the united 
nations 
q are you still not contemplating military intervention 
bush no i mentioned at the time we were going to discuss 
different options which i did after that first press conference 
this morning and were not ruling any options in but were not 
ruling any options out and so that is about where we are right 
now we had thorough briefings you know who was at the meeting 
today by general powell general schwarzkopf and others but i 
think it would be inappropriate to discuss options

bush there was weve had contact with israel yes i have not 
personally but we have and they asked for restraint they asked 
for a short period of time in which to have this arab solution 
evolve and be placed into effect and they are concerned 
obviously with this naked aggression 
but it was more along that line let us try now as neighbors 
and arabs to resolve this and i made clear to them that it had 
gone beyond simply a regional dispute because of the naked 
aggression that violates the united nations charter 
q and what did israel say it would do at this point 
bush i would have to think back to the details of it but 
offering cooperation i think was about where we i would leave 
it there 
q mr president were hearing reports now that some of the 
americans particularly in the oil fields may have been rounded up 
by iraqi troops do you have anything to that how does that affect 
your reaction 
bush well i dont have anything on that right now and 
secondly it would affect the united states in a very dramatic way 
because i view a fundamental responsibility of my presidency as 
protecting american citizens and if theyre threatened or harmed 
or put into harms way i have certain responsibilities but i 
hadnt heard that charles and i hope that that is not correct 
q may i also ask about british citizens any word are they 
safe 
mrs thatcher we have some british citizens in kuwait and you 
probably know that there was a british airways flight there on its 
way to africa and the passengers there are now in a hotel in kuwait 
so we have some there and of course we have both we have 
some a number of other british citizens in kuwait and we too 
are concerned for their safety 
q mr president some of the smaller nations in the persian 
gulf bahrain the emirates and the others obviously have a 
reason to worry about what has happened here what can the united 
states and great britain say to those countries and those people 
who are feeling very concerned today 
bush well the united states can say that we are very much 
concerned for your safety and this naked aggression would 
understandably shake them to the core and so what we are trying 
to do is to have collective action that will reverse this action 
out and to make very clear that we are totally in accord with their 
desire to see the iraqis withdraw ceasefire withdraw and 
restitution of the kuwaiti government and that would be the most 
reassuring thing of all for these countries who whether its true 
or not feel threatened by this action 
q at the risk of being a hypothetical if iraq does not move 
out quickly and has gained a foothold among the smaller gulf 
nations what can the united states and other nations do militarily 
bush we have many options and it is too hypothetical indeed 
for me to comment on them and id refer that to also to the 
prime minister 
mrs thatcher well thats precisely why youre looking at the 
next stage in the security council and what other measures can be 
put into action mandatorily and why the very nations to whom you 
refer we should also need their cooperation in putting other 
actions into effect 
q mr president have you dispatched the uss independence to 
the region and have you heard from saudi arabia 
bush well i would not discuss the movement of any us forces 
and what was the second part of your question 
q have you heard from saudi arabia king fahd 
bush no but i have a call to king fahd and i was supposed to 
have taken that call before now but its been delayed by a few 
minutes and so i hope before i leave here i will talk to him i 
think it is very important that i do talk to him and id leave it 
there i think 
q off mike him to say 
bush huh 
q what do you expect him to say 
bush well thats too hypothetical too but i 
q prime minister 
bush i know hell be expressing the same kind of concern that 
we feel 
q prime minister if i could the president in his executive 
order this morning established a us embargo on trade with iraq 
when you mentioned chapter 7 measures would you support in the 
security council a call for an international embargo on iraqi oil 
mrs thatcher we are prepared to support in the security 
council those measures which collectively we can agree to and which 
collectively we can make effective those are the two tests we 
have already frozen all kuwaiti assets the kuwaitis have very 
considerable assets and its important that those do not fall into 
iraq hands iraq we believe has only very very small assets and 
rather a lot of debt so the position is rather different with her 
right 
bush thank you all very much 
q do you believe an oil embargo could be made effective 
no response to above question

an administrative law judge recommended 
thursday that five us airlines be awarded direct routes to japan 
from six us cities 
the judge picked united delta american continental and 
america west airlines to fly the new routes in what is already a 6 
billion annual aviation market for the two countries cities 
getting new flights would be chicago los angeles and san jose 
calif portland ore seattle and honolulu 
the complex 90page recommendation followed applications by a 
dozen carriers to serve various usjapan routes under a new 
international air agreement a final decision on the carriers and 
routes is expected in november by transportation department 
officials 
judge john j mathias selected united air lines for 
chicagotokyo describing united as the number one carrier in the 
pacific and the carrier that can be expected to enhance the 
overall structure and level of competition in these international 
markets 
mathias proposed that two routes be awarded to delta air lines 
los angelestokyo and portland orenagoya 
other carriers and routes he recommended were american airlines 
for san josetokyo continental airlines for seattlenagoya and 
america west airlines for honolulunagoya 
if approved it would be the first japanese route for america 
west 
mathias said his recommendations followed department guidelines 
for awarding the routes and would enhance competition among both 
airlines and cities to be served 
it is essential that the department see to it that us flag 
competition is maintained and enhanced by these awards he said 
all of the awards would give the airlines authority to fly 
passengers property and mail for five years 
mathias made the decision after hearing arguments from several 
air carriers and officials of competing cities and airport 
authorities 
the airlines that sought routes but got none were hawaiian 
northwest pan american and trans world 
mathias also rejected applications that would have added direct 
flights between japan and st louis houston and the hawaiian 
island of maui 
the new service could add more than 40 roundtrip flights a week 
between the two countries with no carrier allowed to fly more than 
seven flights a week on any route us carriers now operate 156 
weekly flights to and from japan 
three japanese carriers are to get a dozen more weekly round 
trips between tokyo and washington chicago newark and honolulu 
along with 21 other flights connecting us cities to japanese 
cities other than tokyo or osaka 
those routes were part of the international air agreement 
between the united states and japan and the specific carriers will

wheat farmers will have to idle more of their 
base acreage next year to qualify for federal price supports and 
subsidies on their crop agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
announced thursday 
tentatively he said the 1991 acreage reduction program for 
wheat or arp probably will be in the range of 10 percent to 20 
percent farmers were required to set aside only 5 percent of their 
acreage base this year 
yeutter said he could not make a final determination until 
congress completes work on the 1990 farm bill and it is accepted by 
the administration both the house and senate have passed versions 
of the bill 
sen bob dole rkan and others had pressured yeutter to make 
a preliminary announcement of the 1991 wheat program in time for 
winter wheat planting this fall 
in a letter to dole yeutter emphasized the announcement was 
tentative and that it could change because of final provisions 
approved in the 1990 farm bill 
yeutter also pledged that the agriculture department would 
continue to use export subsidies under the export enhancement 
program or eep to keep wheat competitive in world markets 
under eep exporters are given surplus governmentowned 
commodities as subsidies or bonuses so they can reduce prices 
paid by selected foreign buyers wheat has been the biggest 
beneficiary of the eep subsidies 
the program was started in 1985 to help meet export competition 
by foreign shippers notably the european economic community 
yeutter said eep currently is available to 41 countries he said 
these initiatives can be utilized at any time to compete 
headtohead with the europeans

the bush administration kept close track of 
iraqs intentions in recent days through intelligence and 
diplomatic contacts but the timing of iraqs invasion of kuwait 
appears to have caught many officials by surprise 
president bush said thursday he had not been taken totally by 
off guard wednesday night when iraqi tanks rolled across the border 
to kuwait we had good intelligence and our intelligence has had 
me concerned for some time now he said 
in an unusual step the cia too denied being caught unawares 
we provided policymakers with very useful and timely 
information on these events there were no surprises cia 
spokesman mark mansfield said in a statement 
an administration official speaking on condition he not be 
identified said this whole thing didnt come totally as a 
surprise the exact moment that they moved did but it was 
certainly obvious what they were preparing to do 
sen david boren dokla chairman of the senate intelligence 
committee confirmed that us intelligence on iraqs troop buildup 
in recent weeks along the kuwaiti border has been good 
but speaking to reporters after closeddoor briefings from 
pentagon officials boren also said many in the administration and 
congress had engaged in wishful thinking when they believed 
that iraqi president saddam husseins only aim was to force kuwait 
to lower its oil production and thereby move oil prices upward 
us perceptions of iraqs benign intent were further bolstered 
by assurances from arab allies such as egypt and saudi arabia said 
an administration official speaking on condition of anonymity 
iraq too apparently assured the united states of its peaceful 
intentions when saddam met last week in baghdad with us 
ambassador april glaspie 
us officials passed on the iraqi assurances to kuwait said 
kuwaiti ambassador saud nasir alsabah 
glaspie apparently convinced that all was well then left iraq 
on a longplanned vacation said the official 
despite warnings from the cia that iraq would invade us 
officials appeared to have realized iraqs actual intention only 
shortly before the actual invasion began in the predawn hours 
word of the invasion reached washington at 830 pm sending 
officials scurrying from their homes back to their offices at the 
state department and national security council

an abortion rights group said thursday that 
the judicial approach of supreme court nominee david souter in a 
new hampshire case may signal his opposition to abortion rights 
souter nominated by president bush last week to succeed 
retiring justice william brennan has not ruled directly on the 
abortion issue his views on that and other controversial supreme 
court issues are sure to come up in senate confirmation hearings 
beginning sept 13 
the national abortion rights action league said thursday a 
dissent by souter while he was on the new hampshire supreme court 
reveals a dogmatic approach in his philosophy that the senate 
judiciary committee should question 
thomas jipping legal analyst for the conservative coalitions 
for america said naral was grasping at straws and the case 
simply shows souter to be a careful jurist 
in 1986 the majority of the states high court ruled in a case 
called in re estate of dionne that it was against the states 
constitution for judges to charge fees for special court sessions 
souter was the lone dissenter the 1784 state constitutions 
guarantee of the right to obtain justice freely without being 
obliged to purchase it had to be seen in the context of its 
time referring to bribery and other special favors and did not 
apply to modernday fees souter wrote 
narals attorneys in a memo distributed to reporters said 
thursday that souters dogmatic approach to original intent in 
dionne is cause for alarm 
if applied on the supreme court such logic would go against not 
only the courts 1973 roe vs wade abortion rights decision but 
also its landmark school desegregation decision of 1954 naral said 
patrick mcguigan spokesman for coalitions for america said it 
was wrong to compare the a judges application of state law to the 
supreme courts interpretation of the constitution 
abortion rights advocates were less concerned with judicial 
philosophy than with their cause he said will this guy vote for 
our agenda thats what theyre asking he said

as a government prosecutor reeled off marion 
barrys alleged sins to the jury for the last time the mayor 
stared sadly into space 
he smoked and snorted his way through 1987 and 1988 he 
smoked and snorted his way right into 1989 said the prosecutor 
assistant us attorney richard roberts its almost as if mr 
barry wanted to get caught 
his blunt assessment came in the final moments of barrys 
sixweek drug and perjury trial but if the government had the last 
words barrys defense lawyer had some of the most colorful 
the governments witnesses were little lucifers and small 
satans all of them survivors looking out for no 1 attorney r 
kenneth mundy said in his closing arguments 
one of them came out of a crevice he said another was 
down destitute and desperate a third who had fled iran 
believed he would be killed if he returned he was going to avoid 
going back to iran no matter what the cost mundy said 
mundy reserved his most caustic descriptions for convicted drug 
dealer charles lewis a linchpin in the governments case an 
artful dodger mundy said the eternal salesperson selling himself 
to the jury a loose cannon the memory of an elephant after more 
than 100 hours of preparatory meetings with prosecutors 
the barry trial attracted all manner of spectators from 
anonymous law students to the citys famous and flamboyant it also 
inflamed racial tensions and sensitivities even to the point where 
barrys press secretary accused courtroom artists of making 
roberts a lightskinned black look too dark 
barry and his wife effi chatted and laughed thursday during a 
brief break but mrs barry sitting next to barrys mother sat 
through most of the closing arguments looking grim 
on wednesday assistant us attorney judith retchin had twice 
belittled barry by comparing him to a child she had apologized to 
the jury for the sexual nature of some of the testimony saying it 
was impossible to separate the sex and drugs in barrys life 
then came mundy who amidst his skewering of the governments 
witnesses and tactics painted an unflattering picture of his own 
client as a philanderer and occasional drug user 
mundy tried to justify some of barrys behavior such as his 
repeated public denials of drug use and strong support for 
antidrug campaigns he wanted to keep others from falling through 
the ice along with him mundy said 
what else was he to do as mayor mundy asked was he to go 
out and say its ok to use drugs i use drugs he was trying 
in his own frailty to say its wrong the defense lawyer said 
but the prosecution team had other explanations among them 
hypocrisy paranoia compulsion and a habit of blaming others for 
what was his fault 
marion barry was out to get himself said roberts he must 
rise up to his responsibility and accept responsibility for his 
conduct 
barry strode out of the courthouse at the end of the day wearing 
a purple boutonniere telling reporters that purple is for the 
power of god he gives us the strength to overcome the 
maliciousness of the us government were up against goliath 
barry said he had been free of chemical dependencies for 194 
days 
ive admitted my own problems he said theres no shame 
in having a problem the shame is in not getting help later he 
added no one can suffer any more pain or shame or hurt than me

the agriculture department said thursday it 
has suspended all programs involving business with iraq including 
credit arrangements and export subsidy benefits 
officials said the action followed through on president bushs 
order earlier in the day which imposed a virtual trade embargo in 
retaliation for iraqs invasion of kuwait

wheat barley cattle poultry and eggs at subsidized prices

iraq says it invaded kuwait at the 
request of a revolutionary organization there but diplomats 
dismiss that rationale as a largescale charade 
the diplomatic world has remained largely unconviced by the 
flood of statements issued from iraq in the name of the provisional 
free kuwait government 
britains un ambassador crispin tickell called the iraqi 
action an invasion from the outside a phony coup detat from 
within he said the invasion had led to the purported 
establishment of a puppet government 
in a rare display of solidarity the united states and the 
soviet union called for iraq to withdraw and imposed sanctions the 
un security council voted 140 to condemn the invasion 
but iraqs deputy permanent un representative sabah talat 
kadrat said the security council should not be debating the issue 
because the fall of the kuwaiti emir sheik jaber alahmed 
alsabah was an internal matter 
the official kuwait news agency monitored in nicosia did not 
issue a single story all day its computer periodically sputtered 
out the phrase line cut 
on the other hand staterun iraqi news agency from baghdad came 
alive with a series of communiques from the provisional 
government the members were not identified 
the first statement said the provisional government finds that 
one of its primordial obligations is to remedy the harm done by the 
deposed corrupt government to our brothers in iraq 
iraq has been feuding with kuwait over a border dispute it has 
also accused kuwait of violating its oil production quotas set by 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries costing iraq of 
muchneeded revenues because oil is cheaper when supplies are 
higher 
the statement on the iraqi news agency said the border dispute 
would be settled with fraternity and arab national interests 
indicating iraq would probably take the land it wants 
the statement also said the alsabah family which had ruled 
kuwait for almost 250 years was working in concert with zionist 
and colonial powers to plot against iraq 
that is the charge the iraqi press leveled at kuwait when 
tensions began to rise in midjuly 
falsification of elections authoritarianism persecution of 
patriotic personalities have always been characteristics of the 
alsabah family the statement said 
kuwait is one of the few arab states that has experimented with 
a freely elected parliament a new national council with 50 members 
voted into office and 25 appointed by the emir took office after 
june elections 
the communiques from the iraqi news agency said the national 
council has been disbanded

a federal judge rejected a state 
attempt to implement tougher rules at floridas abortion clinics 
saying current regulations sufficiently protect womens health 
the ruling by us district judge jose gonzalez of fort 
lauderdale on wednesday marks another setback on the abortion issue 
for gov bob martinez 
the republican governor failed in october to persuade 
legislators to pass bills limiting access to abortions in the 
nations first test of last summers us supreme court ruling in 
webster vs reproductive health services last fall the state 
supreme court also threw out a parentalconsent law supported by 
the governor 
what i think this means is that nothing will be changed 
ever said charlene carres a lawyer with the florida chapter of 
the american civil liberties union who argued against any new rules 
state attorneys contended that the webster ruling which stemmed 
from a missouri case and granted states broader powers to regulate 
abortion gave floridas department of health and rehabilitative 
services more authority over the clinics 
assistant attorney general jim peters argued at a hearing last 
month that an abortion clinic crackdown was warranted because of 
intolerable conditions found at south florida clinics last fall 
after the miami herald published a report detailing bloodstained 
wrappings and leaking oxygen tanks at a clinic 
but gonzalez rejected that argument in his fourpage order 
contrary to popular opinion webster does not constitute a 
significant modification in decisional law nor would it justify or 
permit any change in the prior judgment of this court the judge 
wrote 
robyn blumner executive director of the florida aclu said the 
organization was pleased with the decision 
what the judge said was that roe vs wade is not dead she 
said 
gonzalez ruled in 1982 that under the 1973 roe vs wade 
decision guaranteeing a right to abortion the department of health 
and rehabilitative services could only check licenses records and 
disposal of fetal remains and make certain that only physicians are 
performing abortions 
the agency could not inspect staff equipment or medical care 
standards it wanted 22 tougher rules including being able to 
conduct unscheduled inspections expand licensing procedures and 
set a number of standards for sanitation medical care and 
infection control 
it would certainly be disappointing that the judge wouldnt 
let the state do more to protect the health and safety of women 
said martinezs press secretary jon peck its certainly in the 
publics interest to make sure there is quality medical care at all 
of these facilities

the countrys new noncommunist president 
pledged to work for more democracy but protesters in the capital 
thursday kept up their pressure on the governing socialist party 
the socialists were also reportedly plagued by defections in 
some cases entire local leaderships quit the party 
zhelyu zhelev was elected wednesday as the countrys first 
noncommunist president in more than four decades his supporters 
picked him as a compromise candidate in an effort to overcome 
growing political polarization as bulgaria introduces greater 
democracy 
it will be my basic endeavor to strengthen parliamentary 
democracy to adopt in the shortest possible time a democratic 
constitution and to implement the most important political and 
economic reforms zhelev said in an interview published in the 
daily demokratsiya the newspaper is put out by zhelevs opposition 
party the union of democratic forces 
asked about the most urgent tasks in coming weeks zhelev said 
first there must be active consultations between the key 
political forces toward creation of a strong competent 
government 
the makeup of the new government was still not clear but 
zhelevs words suggested it may have the backing of the opposition 
a statement wednesday by the socialist party called on all 
members to support the inevitable and necessary political 
compromises that are being reached by the party 
however antigovernment protesters vowed at a jubilant rally of 
15000 thursday night to continue their push for more democracy 
despite the new president 
the protesters who have been camped outside socialist party 
headquarters for almost a month said the socialists could pass key 
measures with their parliamentary majority they demanded 
investigation of the partys property and an independent review of 
the june elections won by the socialists 
the supreme aim of our movement is to unite all the layers of 
society that want to struggle against the totalitarian system 
against the gloomy presence that has blocked the ways of real 
democracy protest leader kolya fevov told the rally 
bulgaria began its march toward democracy with popular 
demonstrations last year in november party members ousted 
longtime communist leader todor zhivkov they later changed their 
name to the socialist party 
the election of the new president wednesday appeared to have 
caused serious discord in their ranks 
entire local party organizations and individuals sent telegrams 
to the socialist leadership in sofia announcing they quit the 
party sources close to the party said the extent of defections 
was not clear in the absence of official word 
more than half the 211 socialist deputies voted against zhelev 
but the new president won 284 of the 389 votes cast

the soviet government suspended its abrupt 
crackdown on visafree travel along its western border thursday 
after it stranded huge crowds of travelers 
the soviet television news announced the halt in visafree 
travel for soviet citizens was being postponed it will now take 
effect aug 10 
officials said they were cracking down because store shelves 
near the borders were being stripped by travelers seeking bargains 
under the visafree rule soviets long barred from foreign 
travel have been pouring back and forth across the borders to 
poland czechoslovakia and hungary carrying only their internal 
passports with an extra page freely available from local police 
stations obtaining an external passport is still a lengthy task 
trade by individuals has exploded as soviets and their neighbors 
discovered each of their countries has different shortages of 
consumer goods and varying subsidized prices 
poles are eager to buy soviet pots and pans vodka caviar 
champagne radios tvs gold jewelry and watches because they are 
far cheaper mushrooms for example cost 10 times as much in 
poland as in the soviet union 
on the polish side travelers buy jeans cosmetics and taiwanese 
and turkish clothes and sell them in the soviet union at inflated 
black market prices 
the polish pap news agency said soviets were waiting as much as 
20 hours to pass through the border 
at ogrodniki the crossing from northwest poland into lithuania 
the wait was four hours on the polish side and 15 hours on the 
soviet side a polish newspaper reported that soviet customs 
officials were slow and arrogant opening car trunks and 
disappearing for hours

the iraqi conquest of kuwait has catapulted 
iraq to the top ranks of world oil powers and poses new economic 
risks for the united states and other countries dependent on 
imported oil private analysts said thursday 
it was unclear whether the iraqi invasion of its tiny neighbor 
at the northern tip of the persian gulf would slow or halt kuwaits 
oil production but the conflict seemed to signal an important 
shift in the balance of world oil power 
the energy department said it did not see an imminent threat to 
the united states or an immediate price runup and said it had no 
planws to tap the nations emergency oil stockpile 
iraq being the dominant military power in the area could end 
up controlling a quarter of world oil supplies said 
christopher flavin a vice president of the worldwatch institute 
just overnight it doubled its share 
by grabbing control of kuwait iraqi president saddam hussein 
added about 94 billion barrels of oil reserves to his countrys own 
100 billion barrels that makes iraq second only to saudi arabia in 
world ranking for oil reserves according to the american petroleum 
institute an industry trade group 
the saudis traditional close allies of kuwait have 255 billion 
barrels of oil reserves 
the united states holds about 26 billion barrels of reserves 
but us oil production has declined rapidly over the past four 
years while consumption has increased as a result 50 percent of 
oil used in the united states is imported and many experts say 
this reliance makes america vulnerable to manipulation of the oil 
market 
the top 10 us oil suppliers are saudi arabia which provides 
15 percent of imports venezuela 13 percent nigeria 125 
percent canada 12 percent iraq 76 percent mexico 6 percent 
virgin islands 36 percent and britain angola and algeria a 
combined 97 percent kuwait supplies about 2 percent 
like kuwait the united arab emirates at the southern end of the 
gulf are vulnerable to iraqi military might the emirates control 
about 100 billion barrels of oil reserves and were the recent 
target of iraqi verbal assaults against excessive oil production by 
members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
president bush signed an order thursday banning us imports of 
iraqi products including oil freezing control of iraqi financial 
assets in the united states and forbidding exports to iraq a 
complete trade embargo 
iraqs oil should be easily replaceable from other sources since 
one barrel of oil is pretty much equivalent to any other barrel 
especially in a time of glutted oil markets like the present 
analysts say iraq by the same token should be able to find other 
sources of wheat and rice it may no longer buy from the united 
states under bushs order unless other nations also ban exports to 
iraq 
oil prices on the world market jumped sharply in reaction to the 
iraqi invasion but flavin and other analysts said the more 
unsettling implication of saddams action is his expanded clout in 
the gulf and his influence over future supplies 
the saudis the worlds largest oil exporters and the no 1 
supplier to the united states are sitting there quaking in their 
boots out of fear that saddam might invade their kingdom or seek 
a voice in running their oil affairs said dillard spriggs 
president of new yorkbased petroleum analysis ltd 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas said the iraqi army might not stop 
at kuwaits borders 
if iraq succeeds i believe that saudi arabia might be next 
and then saddam hussein would have a stranglehold on the wests oil 
supply bentsen said 
bushs chief economic adviser michael boskin told the 
congressional joint economic committee that the us economy was 
not threatened by the impact of iraqs takeover of kuwait even if 
it led to a 25 percent jump in oil prices 
boskin conceded that such a large rise in prices would cause 
some economic damage in the united states but said it would be more 
harmful to japan because of its greater dependence on oil imports 
japan gets virtually all its oil from foreign sources 
also on capitol hill the senate extended by one month bushs 
authority to tap into the 580million barrel strategic petroleum 
reserve an emergency oil storage system in the event of a supply 
squeeze the senate action was not directly linked to the iraqi 
invasion but senators said the gulf crisis served to underscore 
the fragile nature of middle east oil production and transportation 
all of the opec countries at least all of those in the 
middle east will be intimidated by iraq said sen j bennett 
johnston dla chairman of the senate energy and natural 
resources committee iraq will be able to set such prices as it 
wants 
henson moore the deputy secretary of energy told reporters at 
energy department headquarters that the administration was not 
considering tapping into the emergency reserve which he said 
contains the equivalent of 75 days worth of oil consumption 
we do not see any imminent threat to the united states 
by the loss of iraqi oil moore said nor do we see any longterm 
significant increase in prices

gov bill clements declared the effects 
of a 500000gallon oil spill were greatly exaggerated as a 
health department ban against fishing the rich galveston bay went 
into effect thursday 
clements a former oil man toured the bay by helicopter and 
initially decided to cancel a plan to use oileating microbes on 
the slick 
his announcement shocked state officials and he later backed 
down and decided to allow limited application of the process called 
bioremediation 
meanwhile salvage crews found about 20000 gallons of oil in a 
tank aboard a ruptured barge nearly sunken in the houston ship 
channel since the collision saturday with a greek tanker 
the coast guard again shut down traffic in the channel to allow 
crews time to remove the fragile barge officials said earlier in 
the week the delays were costing ship owners at least 15 million 
per day 
the coast guard took over cleanup efforts thursday because apex 
towing co owner of the two barges damaged in the collision was 
nearing its insurance liability limit 
we call the shots now and we pay the bills said chief 
warrant officer rick meidt the coast guard will bill apex towing 
co for the cleanup costs 
after his tour thursday clements said i think that the 
socalled oil spill has been greatly exaggerated we had difficulty 
finding any 
officials had gained federal approval to use bioremediation to 
help clear delicate marshlands of a filmy black oil but clements 
said the oil had dispersed too much for the microbes to be 
effective in most areas 
his statement seemed to contradict the judgment of the texas 
health department which the day before had ordered the bay closed 
to all fishing for fear of contamination from the oil 
texas general land commissioner garry mauro was outraged 
we know that skimmers booms and dispersants will not save 
galveston bay the only technology that holds even a promise is 
bioremediation mauro said 
clements later reversed himself and decided to allow 100 pounds 
of microbes mixed with water to be pumped onto two areas of pelican 
island adjacent to galveston island 
coast guard officials said thursday the oil sheen has thinned to 
a 12mile stretch throughout the bay with heavier patches around 
redfish island pelican island texas city dike eagle point and 
port bolivar 
were fortunate clements said were blessed that it has 
turned out this way its not near as serious a problem as was 
first anticipated 
the bay contains the nations seventh largest estuary system 
with rich banks of shrimp crabs oysters and valuable fish 
bay shrimpers put out of work by the fishing ban said they were 
skeptical of clements views 
i hope hes right but realistically i think hes full of 
baloney said cl standley a former president of professional 
involvement of seafood concerned enterprises 
clements said he expected the fishing ban would be lifted soon 
its not really as bad as we thought he said 
but standley disagreed i think it could possibly be weeks 
and if it is thats going to be devastating he said 
the bays commercial fishing industry generates 240 million 
annually and its recreational fishing industry generates 170 
million annually said david hankla field supervisor for the us 
fish and wildlife service 
with galveston bay closed fishing boats will have to move to 
other gulf of mexico inlets or out to the gulf itself 
in another development the captain of the greek tanker 
testifying for the second day at a federal inquiry into the 
collision that caused the spill again blamed the accident on a 
houston pilot 
capt nikolos fioratos testified that the pilot ordered the 
shinoussa to travel too fast through the ship channel then told 
him to tell authorities that the accident happened because the 
channel was too narrow 
the hearing is being held by the national transportation safety 
board and the coast guard

the soviet government is drafting tens of 
thousands of soldiers 10 to 15 percent of the nations civilian 
trucks and even the kgb to harvest a huge grain crop the soviet 
news agency tass said thursday 
it said the crop was so large it has overwhelmed the nations 
ability to collect it all 
soviet officials are so worried about losing any of the 
unexpectedly big crop that some suggested declaring a nationwide 
state of emergency tass said prime minister nikolai ryzhkov 
rejected the idea thursday 
the grain crop is now expected to reach 260 million tons thats 
a mindboggling figure for soviets whose previous record was last 
years 211 million tons no reason has been given for this years 
rise in harvest figures 
the soviets are already losing 2 million tons a day because they 
cannot harvest and store it quickly enough said vladilen nikitin 
head of the state food commission 
soviet media have blamed shortages of fuel trucks and storage 
space as well as the centrally planned economys inability to 
adjust to the demand the country annual loses 20 to 30 percent of 
its food crop on the way to market 
the government has already sent 70 army battalions with 35000 
trucks to help with the harvest another 20 battalions with 10000 
trucks will be added tass said 
ryzhkov said 10 to 15 percent of the nations trucks will also 
be drawn into the harvest campaign regardless of their ownership 
tass said 
the kgb state security agency and the interior ministry also 
will be asked to contribute resources tass said

president bush froze iraqs assets in this 
country and cut off imports of 588000 barrels a day of iraqi oil 
thursday in retaliation for the lightning invasion of kuwait us 
officials were seeking word on american oil workers missing in the 
region 
kuwaits ambassador appealed for american military help for his 
country but none was forthcoming at least for the moment bush 
said were not ruling any options in but were not ruling any 
options out 
a state department official disclosed that the invading iraqi 
troops rounded up and moved a few american oil field workers 
from just inside kuwaits border he said their whereabouts were 
not known 
we are making every effort to make inquiries and find out 
more said the official who commented on condition he not be 
identified 
the president in blocking virtually all commerce with iraq 
denounced its naked aggression against a small neighbor some 
members of congress compared iraqi leader saddam hussein to hitler 
and said they believed the american people would accept higher fuel 
prices resulting from an attempt to strangle iraq economically 
bush flew to aspen colo to deliver a speech appealing for 
keeping america strong enough militarily to respond to terrorism 
hostage taking and renegade regimes and unpredictable rulers 
he said iraqs brutal aggression made his point that 
despite the lessening of the soviet threat in recent months 
threats can arise suddenly unpredictably and from unexpected 
quarters 
bush conferred in colorado with the vacationing british prime 
minister margaret thatcher he arranged to return to washington 
earlier than planned 
mrs thatcher referring to saddam said we find his behavior 
intolerable she called for collective action by the member 
states of the united nations 
bush said he conferred by telephone with egyptian president 
hosni mubarak and other arab leaders and said he was encouraged by 
their efforts to find an arab answer to the problem 
later bush spoke for a halfhour by telephone with king fahd of 
saudi arabia said white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
and they agreed that the attack on kuwait was absolutely 
unacceptable 
out for a walk bush was asked by reporters what he talked about 
with the king bush replied just reviewing options going to 
have some meetings over there 
before leaving washington bush said the united states would do 
whatever more is necessary to defend our longstanding vital 
interests in the persian gulf he said he and his advisers would 
consider all possible options available to us 
but he wasnt specific and said he wasnt discussing military 
intervention a course which experts said offered no easy choices 
to him he added that he wouldnt talk publicly about military 
options in any event 
we dont stand a chance if we dont get any aid from our 
friends a dismayed ambassador saud nasser alsabah told 
reporters us intervention at this stage is of paramount 
importance 
as an alternative bush took one of the toughest economic 
options open to him he froze control of iraqi assets in the united 
states and of kuwaits assets too so they wouldnt fall into 
iraqi hands 
and he halted commerce between the united states and iraq a 
nation that normally provides the united states with 588000 
barrels of oil a day 76 percent of us imports 
administration officials said they could not estimate the value 
of kuwaiti and iraqi assets affected by the freeze but one 
treasury official described them as significant 
after a morning of closed briefings sen david boren dokla 
chairman of the senate intelligence committee said if iraq headed 
for saudi arabia and its oil fields just 250 miles across the 
desert i think it would be a direct threat to the security of 
this country 
saddam must calculate whether his nation weary from its long 
war with iran is willing to support further miltary adventures 
boren said a possible invasion by iraq of saudi arabia cannot be 
ruled out he said 
and sen lloyd bentsen dtexas expressed fear that if the 
iraqi takeover of kuwait succeeds saudi arabia might be next 
and then saddam hussein would have a stranglehold on the wests oil 
supply 
the texan said the united states should seek a worldwide embargo 
against iraqi oil iraq is deeply in debt and very dependent on 
oil revenues and such an embargo would be an effective way to get 
their attention he said 
the timing of the invasion appeared to have caught many 
officials off guard bush said he had not been taken totally by 
surprise 
we had good intelligence and our intelligence has had me 
concerned for some time now he said 
we provided policymakers with very useful and timely 
information on these events the cia said in an unusual statement 
denying it had been caught unawares there were no surprises 
boren also said many in the administration and congress had 
engaged in wishful thinking when they believed that saddams 
only aim was to force kuwait to lower its oil production and 
thereby move oil prices upward 
reflecting the anger boiling up on capitol hill rep ike 
skelton dmo told the house the attack is a financial assault 
on america and on the rest of the world that is dependent on 
mideastern oil 
the house gave speedy 4160 approval to a pending economic 
sanctions bill aimed at iraq the measure would cut off iraqs 200 
million a year in exportimport bank credits and tighten 
restrictions on us exports that could have military as well as 
civilian uses 
pentagon sources also said an evacuation of 3000 americans 
mostly business people from kuwait was under consideration about 
130 are us employees 
the state department said us embassy personnel were safe and 
the embassy grounds had not been penetrated during the fighting 
but it advised americans to postpone travel to kuwait 
the aircraft carrier uss independence and six escorts were 
directed to head toward the region from the indian ocean but were 
several days from reaching a striking distance position outside 
the persian gulf pentagon sources said 
an eightship force deployed on maneuvers earlier was still in 
the gulf but not equipped for any type of land assault 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said we do not have aircraft within striking distance 
unless we fly landbased longrange bombers into that region and 
i do not think the time is now for us to talk about military force 
we would not want to get into a ground war in that area 
bush in his first public reaction called for the immediate 
and unconditional withdrawal of all the iraqi forces and said 
there is no place for this sort of naked aggression in todays 
world 
youre dealing with a madman here sen christopher dodd 
dconn said of saddam im not sure hes going to respond to 
sanctions 
presidential economic adviser michael boskin told congress that 
the us economy should be able to withstand any foreseeable 
increase in oil prices even a 25 percent rise in oil prices would 
likely have only a modest adverse impact on us economic growth 
he said 
the united states gets half of its oil from abroad and 10 
percent from iraqi and kuwait america imported about 24 billion 
in oil and other goods last year from iraq while us exports to 
iraq chiefly agricultural commodities totaled 117 billion in 
1989

most of the approximately 3000 americans living 
in kuwait work in the oil or construction industries the state 
department said thursday 
invading iraqi troops rounded up six american oil field workers 
near the border of kuwait the department said in a statement 
their whereabouts were unknown 
iraq seized control of some the persian gulf kingdoms rich oil 
fields during its blitzkrieg invasion wednesday 
texaco inc operates an oil refinery under a 5050 joint venture 
with kuwait oil co in a neutral zone in southwestern kuwait 
next to saudi arabia it is the only usowned refinery operating 
in iraq or kuwait 
texaco spokeswoman anita larsen said 17 americans are among 800 
employees there all were reported safe earlier in the day and the 
refinery was running she said many of the employees have family 
with them but larsen said she did not know the exact number 
major middle east contractors such as houstonbased brown amp root 
currently have no american employees in the area company officials 
said 
the us government employees 130 people in kuwait mainly at 
its embassy said state department spokesman richard boucher all

of san francisco did not return phone calls thursday seeking 
comment about their employees 
more than 60 percent of kuwaits 18 million residents are 
foreigners about half the population was believed to be outside 
the country for summer holidays 
many of the americans work as consultants for small contracting 
firms officials said 
a middle east expert said it was unlikely us citizens would be 
singled out for violence 
i dont think americans and western business people are really 
at risk at all said dr kofi afriyie of rutgers university 
look at their motivation iraq wants to increase its own oil 
revenues if they incur the displeasure of western countries it 
would defeat its own purpose

the house on thursday approved passenger user 
fees at airports as a way of financing new gates runways and other 
construction designed to cut increasing congestion and delays 
fees would be limited to 3 per passenger at each airport with 
a ceiling of 12 per passenger for one roundtrip 
this bill will bring our air transport system into the 21st 
century said rep lawrence coughlin rpa as the house voted 
252171 to defeat an effort to drop the user fees from the 
legislation 
the house then approved the bill 40515 
the measure would authorize 17 billion over two years for 
airport operations and development it calls for spending more than 
6 billion in the aviation trust fund over the next five years to 
upgrade airports 
the senate has taken no action on the plan 
house members clashed over the provision authorizing local 
airports to impose fees on passengers whether to impose such fees 
would be a decision made by local officials subject to regulation 
by the federal department of transportation 
improvements are needed to ease crowding and delays caused by an 
increase in airline passengers from 266 million in 1978 to 480 
million last year authorities are forecasting an increase to 750 
million within 10 years 
rep dan rostenkowski dill and other chicagoans said that a 
third major airport to service the city could not be built without 
the passenger charge the new airport is estimated to cost 49 
billion 
but critics said the fees would benefit only a few cities with 
major construction projects on the drawing board especially 
chicago and that most travelers would reap no benefits from the 
airport improvements 
aviation passengers are being taken for a ride by the white 
house and congress said rep norman mineta dcalif 
a study by airport associations has suggested that 10 billion a 
year would be needed for the next five years to overcome congestion 
at many of the nations major airports the transportation 
department has generally accepted the estimate 
rep william f clinger jr rpa said the critics had 
provided no alternative way to meet the costs 
they can hope the tooth fairy will under cover of night 
extend the runway or build the new terminal clinger said

32yearold ms mcgregor reported by telephone

we were totally unprepared one feels like there should have 
been a bit of warning said 37yearold catherine baker of 
illinois an employee of a british design firm in kuwait 
she said it was unbelievable it doesnt seem real

in kuwait where more than 60 percent of the 19 million residents 
are foreigners 
white house spokesman roman popadiuk said no americans were 
reported harmed 
diplomatic sources in the persian gulf estimated that more than 
200 kuwaitis were killed or wounded in the invasion 
the british embassy was hit by shellfire and the sheraton and 
hilton hotels evacuated their guests diplomats reported 
serge sejournet 30 an artist from paris said i think it 
will be over soon somehow i dont think i want to get out of 
kuwait he said he thought the united states would bring the 
situation under control 
sejournet said iraqi soldiers on the street in front of his home 
in downtown kuwait were very friendly with everyone saying hello 
to all 
he ms baker and other expatriates said they gathered in homes 
of friends listening to the fighting 
herb linnen a spokesman for atampt said in washington that calls 
to kuwait reached 2000 every five minutes friends and relatives

employees in kuwait on thursday and ascertained that the dozens of 
workers and their families were safe

the senate on thursday left intact president 
bushs 1991 budget request for the b2 bomber but imposed 
restrictions on the 46 billion until critical tests on the 
stealth aircraft have been conducted 
by a vote of 972 the senate adopted the amendment to the 289 
billion defense bill as republicans fought to salvage the aircraft 
and gop leader bob dole argued that iraqs invasion of kuwait was 
the wakeup call against deep cuts in defense spending 
just moments later proponents of the b2 narrowly managed to 
fight off the most serious effort yet to gut the program an 
amendment that would have stalled the program at 15 planes already 
authorized failed 5345 
this just about defeats the program sen sam nunn dga 
chairman of the armed services committee and a supporter of the 
b2 warned shortly before the vote 
the measures sponsor sen william cohen rmaine argued 
against the bomber citing the expensive cost of a single plane 
865 million and the justice departments recommendation that the 
manufacturer northrop corp be prohibited from future defense 
contracts due to fraud charges 
lets fund what we have on line right now but no more b2s 
until you prove them cohen said 
the senate action comes on the heels of the house armed services 
committees adoption of a 283 billion defense bill that halts 
production of the program at the 15 planes 
opponents of the plane have argued that since the cold war has 
ended and the budget deficit has grown the planes worth is 
questionable 
the senate did approve an amendment sponsored by nunn and the 
panels ranking republican sen john warner of virginia that 
calls for the plane to pass 13 requirements before about 2 billion 
in procurement money can be spent ten of those tests were included 
in last years defense bill 
all total the administration is seeking 46 billion for two 
b2 bombers in the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
i understand the case against the b2 all of us are suffering 
from sticker shock nunn said on the senate floor 
but the panel chairman argued that the plane is indeed a 
revolutionary change in capability to conduct air warfare 
in its bill the house panel also slashed nearly 2 billion from 
bushs request for the strategic defense initiative as it adopted a 
defense package that chops 24 billion from bushs pentagon budget 
of 307 billion for fiscal 1991 
in the wake of the cuts the bush administration was relying on 
the senate to salvage its prized weapons programs including the 
b2 bomber and sdi 
in its bill the senate armed services committee approved the 
presidents proposal for two b2 bombers in fiscal 1991 and trimmed 
1 billion from the budget for sdi or star wars 
the first senate vote on the b2 bomber followed the senate gop 
leaders prediction 
i think this vote ought to be overwhelming today dole said 
during the afternoon of debate maybe yesterday it might have 
been close but we need something to wake us up from time to time 
we need a wakeup call we need to be alerted that were not going 
to be able to control the events in the world 
the air force envisions the b2 bomber to be used after a 
nuclear missile war to seek out the remaining targets in the 
soviet union 
warner argued that the government has already invested more than 
26 billion and terminating the program at 15 planes would 
increase the per unit cost to more than 23 billion per plane 
later in the evening the senate rejected an amendment that 
would have prohibited using us dollars in the nato infrastructure 
fund for a new air base in crotone italy to house the 401st 
tactical wing the vote was 5147 
the house armed services committee earlier this week banned the 
use of american money for the installation made necessary by 
spains decision to force out the 72 f16 jet fighters from 
torrejon de ardoz 
the senate vote came after warner said he had just received a 
telephone call from gen john galvin head of the european command 
who argued that if he was left with only two bases one had to be 
in crotone

iran which fought an eightyear war with iraq condemned the 
invasion and called for immediate iraqi withdrawal a foreign 
ministry statement warned that iran cannot remain indifferent to

occupying iraqi troops have adopted the sheraton 
hotel in a kuwaiti suburb as their interim headquarters eschewing 
the government buildings they seized earlier thursday for the 
hotels more comfortable lodgings 
much has changed overnight in this capital since tankled iraqi 
troops crossed the border 80 miles away before dawn and charged 
into kuwait iraq issued a statement in baghdad saying the troops 
were in kuwait at the request of a revolutionary council 
most people here seemed unaware what revolutionary council had 
called for their governments ouster 
instead scenes from the occupied city thursday bordered on the 
bizarre 
in one area of the city about 30 kuwaitis stood patiently in 
line waiting to rent videocassette movies for the night the 
reason in the words of one woman is that most residents are 
staying at home sitting tight 
many kuwait autos have been left in the streets some not even 
parked but merely abandoned as if the drivers saw the approaching 
troops and fled roads and sidewalks in parts of the city have been 
damaged and churned up by the hundreds of tanks that entered kuwait 
some of the iraqi troops have been seen driving around the 
capital in newly confiscated kuwaiti police cars 
at a circular intersection iraqi troops mill about sitting 
eating and talking ground rocketlaunchers stand idle nearby 
ready to be fired if necessary about 100 soldiers meander about 
outside the newly occupied sheraton hotel in groups of 10 
in downtown kuwait the streets are largely deserted with none 
of the usual bustle of taxis and buses only in the suburbs do 
local residents dare to go outside for long though some are still 
fearful of further incidents with the invading forces life in the 
suburbs however seems basically normal 
the only sign of domestic unrest was spot panicbuying in the 
supermarkets where residents shopped quickly and headed right home

congress moved rapidly thursday to endorse 
president bushs economic sanctions against iraq and some 
lawmakers said they would support us military action if it is 
coordinated with allies in the middle east 
lawmakers said they believed the american public would support a 
total cutoff of us economic ties with iraq even it it meant a 
shortterm increase in fuel prices because of fears that an 
unstable ruler could gain a longterm strangehold on persian gulf 
oil supplies 
youre talking about something that could totally unravel the 
whole middle east said sen patrick leahy dvt talk about 
the analogy of the fuse being lit its being lit in kuwait 
some democrats welcomed bushs tough embargo but questioned why 
he had not acted sooner they said a policy of appeasement by 
bush and president reagan his predecessor might have emboldened 
iraqi ruler saddam hussein to invade kuwait 
the administration finally this morning as a result of the 
invasion has a good policy said rep howard berman dcalif 
bermans proposed legislation to impose economic sanctions on 
iraq strengthened by bushs executive order was sent on a fast 
track to the house floor where it was approved on a 4160 vote 
one lawmaker rep pat williams dmont voted present 
because he said the action was too hasty and included a grain 
embargo like the illfated 1980 ban imposed by president carter 
against the soviet union 
the bill also would cut off iraqs 200 million in annual 
exportimport bank credits and tighten restrictions on us exports 
that could have either civilian or military uses 
we want to indicate through legislation that we are in full 
support of the presidents action said rep dante fascell 
dfla chairman of the house foreign affairs committee 
later the senate voted 970 for a resolution condemning the 
invasion praising bushs sanctions and calling for a worldwide 
boycott of iraqi oil and an end to arms sales as part of a full 
economic blockade if those measures fail to pressure iraq to leave 
kuwait the united nations should pursue multilateral military 
actions it said 
berman said americans will be willing to make economic 
sacrifices to show their opposition to iraqs invasion 
in the end i dont think the people of the united states want 
to appease a bully to ensure the uninterrupted flow of mideast 
oil berman said if unchecked he said saddam could take total 
control of the regions oil reserves 
but in a sense that may already have happened said rep 
matthew mchugh dny iraqs powerful presence in kuwait may 
intimidate saudi arabia the peninsulas largest oil producer into 
going along with any oil policy dictated from baghdad he said 
the saudis are going to be very cautious about stepping up 
production to stabilize prices said mchugh a member of the house 
intelligence committee they may not do so without a promise of 
us support if attacked he suggested 
house speaker thomas foley dwash said it was too early to 
say what military steps the united states might take but sen 
lloyd bentsen dtexas held open the option of a military response 
together with our friends in the region we should consider 
defensive military measures that might be needed to guard against 
any further iraqi aggression bentsen said cautioning that i 
dont foresee the need for us combat involvement 
instead bentsen urged a worldwide embargo on purchases of iraqi 
oil 
sen christopher dodd dconn and some other legislators said 
military action in coordination with gulf allies eventually might 
be necessary 
youre dealing with a madman here said sen christopher 
dodd dconn likening saddam to adolf hitler im not sure hes 
going to respond to sanctions 
rep stephen solarz dny said bush had acted boldly and 
comprehensively in severing us trade with iraq and freezing the 
us assets of iraq and kuwait 
but rep tom lantos dcalif accused bush of a policy of 
appeasement toward iraq there was a total misjudgment of the 
policies and goals of saddam hussein to the very moment his troops 
invaded a neighboring country he said 
added rep mel levine dcalif many have been urging this 
administration to take saddam hussein much more seriously than they 
have 
berman said problems began when reagan tilted in favor of 
iraq during its eightyear war with iran urging us allies to arm 
the baghdad government while overlooking iraqs human rights 
violations and support for terrorism 
foley said it would be foolish to think the invasion could 
have been averted if bush had ordered sanctions earlier

eight american oil field workers were reported 
missing near the border of kuwait and company officials suspected 
they had been picked up by the invading iraqi army the state 
department said on thursday 
the whereabouts of the eight were unknown 
our embassy in baghdad has asked the government of iraq for 
information on the whereabouts of these american citizens 
reminding the government of iraq of its commitment to respect the 
security and welfare of us citizens the department said in an 
unattributed statement 
word of the detention came from a us oil company for whom the 
eight worked and the department asserted it was not at liberty to 
identify that company or any of the eight because of provisions of 
the privacy act 
a state department official said the company reported the 
roundup by the iraqis but the united states has not been able to 
confirm whether that is what happened 
texaco inc is the only us oil company with operations in 
kuwait texaco has 17 americans among 800 employees working in the 
joint saudi arabiankuwaiti neutral zone said spokeswoman anita 
larsen in new york 
the spokeswoman said all 17 had been reported safe earlier in 
the day 
meanwhile a texas television station identified one of the 
eight as charles amos of gilmer an employee of santa fe drilling 
co of california amos family was notified by the state 
department on thursday morning according to the report on kltvtv 
a short time before a state department official disclosed the 
suspected roundup president bush was asked about reports that 
american workers in kuwait had been rounded up 
i dont have anything on that right now he said 
secondly it would affect us in a very dramatic way because i 
view a fundamental responsibility of my presidency is protecting 
american citizens if theyre put into harms way i have certain 
responsibilities 
an estimated 3000 americans live in kuwait many of them with 
ties to the oil business 
iraqi troops seized control of some of kuwaits rich oil fields 
during their blitzkrieg invasion of the persian gulf kingdom on 
wednesday 
officials did not want to conclude that the eight workers had 
been taken hostage 
all we know is that they are missing said a us official 
who asked not to be further identified they are in a situation 
where we are very concerned about there whereabouts but at this 
point we are not drawing conclusions

washington ap the house began debate on a major civil rights 
bill thursday and voted to put a ceiling on punitive damages that 
courts can award to women who are victims of intentional job 
discrimination 
this will lay the unfounded fears to rest said the chairman 
of the judiciary committee rep jack brooks dtexas said as the 
house approved the cap 289134 
punitive damages for women religious minorities and the 
disabled could be no more than 150000 or the amount of 
compensatory damages awarded by the court whichever is larger 
the house worked into the night thursday on the but put off a 
vote on passage and other major floor action until friday 
the bill is the top item on the civil rights communitys 
congressional shopping list and would effectively reverse five 
supreme court decisions last year it is advancing under threat of 
a presidential veto with the bush administration saying it would 
lead to hiring quotas for members of minority groups 
provisions range from a ban on racial harrassment in the 
workplace to barriers against reopening courtapproved fairhiring 
plans 
the most controversial provisions would make it easier for those 
claiming to be victims of job discrimination to win lawsuits 
against employers based on statistics 
the ceiling on damages was designed to ease business concerns 
about the potential for huge openended jury awards for women 
victimized by discrimination it also was aimed at winning support 
among southern democrats 
liberal sponsors of the bill split over the issue rep don 
edwards dcalif chairman of the civil rights subcommittee of the 
judiciary committee voted against it education and labor 
committee chairman rep augustus hawkins dcalif voted for it 
the southern democrats voted with us on this cap and most of 
them will now support us when the house turns to a major 
amendment that would limit not only punitive but all damages to 
100000 said hawkins 
that proposal has been championed by rep john lafalce dny 
and has been praised by the bush administration as a step away from 
quotas sponsors say it would wreck the bill 
hawkins said sponsors would beat back the lafalce amendment by 
a whopping good vote 
womens groups have been opposing such ceilings saying they 
would be unfair in view of unlimited punitive damages allowed in 
the case of deliberate racial discrimination in the workplace 
the house earlier had approved 39724 an amendment making 
clear that no hiring quotas would be required under the bill 
similar language was included in the measure when it was approved 
by the judiciary committee but lawmakers wanted a chance to vote 
on it separately 
republican critics scoffed that the noquotas amendment amounted 
to nothing more than a cosmetic exercize i cant believe the 
charade of it all declared rep nancy johnson rconn 
civil rights forces scoff at the charge that the bill would lead 
to quotas 
if anyone raises the subject of quotas i want to know where 
it is said rep john conyers dmich there is no reference to 
quotas in this bill 
womens groups have been crusading against the lafalce measure 
noting that there is no cap on damages that courts can now award to 
victims of racial discrimination in the workplace 
the decision by lafalce to sponsor the rival plan plainly irked 
fellow democrats who positioned the proposed amendment for floor 
action in such a way that it could be offered only by republican 
leader bob michel of illinois or someone designated by him 
as debate began rep f james sensenbrenner jr rwis 
blasted the bill sponsors for fashioning a measure that exempts 
congress itself 
the same thing ought to apply in the congress of the united 
states sensenbrenner said he urged lawmakers to end the 
hypocrisy of us insulating ourselves from our own laws once and 
for all this afternoon 
black lawmakers launched the debate by pleading for approval of 
the bill 
this is the single most important civil rights legislation 
since the 1964 civil rights act said rep al wheat dmo he 
said it carried a simple message that discrimination and 
particularly intentional discrimination based on race is not 
acceptable in america 
rep ron dellums dcalif attacked the lafalce substitute 
declaring there is no substitute for justice

public phone calls through atampt were cut off 
thursday between the united states and kuwait and iraq an atampt 
spokesman said 
two other telephone companies were still getting some calls 
through thursday evening according to their spokesmen 
the atampt spokesman herb linnen said some calls got through to 
kuwait as iraqi troops invaded but there were long delays because 
of the heavy volume of calls at one point 2000 every five 
minutes 
calls between the united states and iraq however were cut off 
from the iraqi end without any explanation at about 10 am edt he 
said 
efforts to route calls to both countries through britain were 
not very successful because of the heavy number of calls already on 
those lines he said 
linnen said the company itself had managed to get only six or 
seven calls through to kuwait before service was stopped about 
630 pm 
mci was having trouble completing calls between kuwait and the 
united states because of technical difficulties but was able to 
get calls through to iraq spokesman john houser 
a us sprint spokesman john landsberg said the large number of 
attempted calls between the united states and kuwait clogged 
circuits and prevented calls from going through calls to iraq were 
still possible he said 
japanese telecommunications authorities reported kuwaitjapan 
service interrupted about the same time but british authorities 
said some calls were still getting through linnen said 
atampt employees include americans canadians british filipinos 
and one sri lankan who were working on a project with the kuwaiti 
government to improve communications the spokesman said

congress responding to a spate of ethics 
scandals is taking its first step toward curtailing lawmakers 
money chase for campaign funds as senators also vote to quit 
accepting outside speaking fees 
the senates democratic majority overrode republican opposition 
wednesday night to approve the first change in federal election 
laws since congress voted 16 years ago to publicly finance and 
limit spending on presidential elections in wake of the watergate 
scandal 
on a 5940 largely partyline vote the senate approved a 
campaign finance bill to place similar limits on congressional 
candidates spending provide them with subsidies to buy television 
advertising and outlaw specialinterest political action committees 
we have a system out of control said sen david boren 
dokla the bills chief author the money chase has not slowed 
down

the house easily approved a 1990 farm bill 
that limits subsidies but is faulted by the bush administration for 
not achieving enough savings 
i think the basic skeleton of legislation will stay 
together agriculture committee chairman kika de la garza 
dtexas said wednesday night after the houses 32791 vote the 
main problem is going to be numbers with the budget summit 
the administration has threatened a veto if costs in the bill 
are not decreased 
the administration wants no program said de la garza

smokers carrying a stillunidentified gene are 
more likely to develop lung cancer at an early age according to a 
study that traced smoking and lung cancer histories in 337 
louisiana families 
the study published in the journal of the national cancer 
institute on wednesday said there was a clear genetic component to 
the early onset of lung cancer among smokers however it said the 
gene plays a lesser role in cancer among smokers late in life 
if you smoke long enough itll get to you eventually 
regardless of what genes you are carrying said thomas a 
sellers a university of minnesota scientist who was the lead 
researcher in the study the genetic component influences the age 
of onset of the disease 
he said that statistically about 27 percent of the smoking 
population will get lung cancer over a lifetime

halfwhite halfindian 
mayfair was never meant to be but the indians refused to leave and 
the result is an example of what south africa could become after 
apartheid 
the residential area on the fringe of johannesburgs downtown 
area was designated white but the government eventually 
acknowledged the presence of indians by declaring part of it open 
to them indian families later moved into the white area too 
making mayfair truly multiracial 
you see the emergence of a geniune nonracial outlook said 
cassim saloojee an indian resident and activist who has fought for 
integrated neighborhoods 
mayfair in fact gives one a glimpse of what could happen in 
south africa once apartheid has been done away with saloojee 
said 
as president fw de klerk moves ahead with plans to dismantle 
apartheid the issue of segregated neighborhoods is among the most 
emotional 
antiapartheid groups say living where one chooses is a 
fundamental right but rightwing whites vow never to allow 
integration in their neighborhoods 
the group areas act of 1950 which segregates neighborhoods is 
part of the official apartheid race policy that preserves supremacy 
for south africas 5 million whites over the 28 million blacks 
since last year the government has opened 10 small 
neighborhoods to all races and has promised to amend but not 
repeal the group areas act next year 
blacks indians and people of mixed race have lived in many 
white urban areas illegally for years usually because of housing 
shortages in zones designated for their own racial groups the 
whites only hillbrow neighborhood of johannesburg for example 
has become overwhelmingly black 
change in mayfair and other integrated areas has been achieved 
by the persistence of many ordinary people like gladys govender 
of indian descent 
mrs govender 60 says she has never lived in an area set aside 
for indians who account for just under 1 million of south africas 
38 million people 
she and her family moved to mayfair in 1979 into a house on 
hanover street a slightly seedy area that was the unofficial 
dividing line between the white and indian sections 
they chose mayfair mrs govender said because they needed a 
bigger house and the closest officially indian area lenasia was 
nearly 20 miles outside johannesburg 
the hanover street house was rented in the name of a white 
person in an attempt to get around the law but within months 
police were calling on the govenders regularly 
even at night she said and told of an evening when the 
family had just laid laid the table to have supper then they 
rushed in 
authorities charged mrs govender with violating the group areas 
act with the help of an antiapartheid group called actstop she 
won a landmark case in 1982 that allowed her to remain in mayfair 
in its ruling the court said the government must provide 
alternative accommodations for anyone evicted from an area for 
racial reasons because of the critical housing shortage for 
nonwhtes the decision makes it much more difficult for the 
government to evict or prosecute then 
soon after mrs govenders victory the government declared part 
of mayfair an indian neighborhood and families in overcrowded 
indian areas began buying houses there 
more indian families also crossed the line into the white part 
of mayfair the johannesburg city council now estimates mayfair has 
7000 white residents and about 2500 indians not counting indians 
who live illegally in the white sector 
several relatively minor racial incidents have occurred in 
mayfair in recent years but no serious ones

a mariachi band was playing for tourists in 
garibaldi plaza when the stink of paint thinner began to overpower 
the fragrance of roses sold by strolling vendors 
a thin disheveled woman stood in the middle of the square with 
a folded piece of cloth in one hand and a plastic bottle of clear 
liquid in the other 
this is my only vice said the 23yearold prostitute who 
gave her name as gloria and swayed as she held the solventsoaked 
rag to her face this a little wine and my cigarettes 
narcotics abuse has not reached epidemic proportions in mexico 
a national drug prevention program and a troubled economy have 
helped keep the use of hard drugs from expanding 
cheap inhalants like glue paint thinner and other industrial 
solvents are becoming popular among the lower economic classes and 
fears are growing that mexico is fertile ground for drug addiction 
one reason is the wide variety of illegal drugs available here 
mexico grows marijuana and opium poppies and is a transit point 
for cocaine and heroin bound for the united states from south 
america 
more than half the 85 million people are under 19 and an 
estimated 800000 enter the glutted job market each year 
they have no opportunity for employment or school said 
mario alberto who works at drug addicts anonymous there is a 
great number of people at risk 
the latest national survey of addictions found that 43 percent 
of mexicans more than half of them under age 34 had experimented 
with drugs at least once it was conducted in 1988 and released 
this year by the general directorate of epidemeology and the 
mexican psychiatric institute 
it said drug use was significantly more prevalent in 
northwestern states like baja california sonora and sinaloa that 
are close to the us border or serve as bases for largescale 
traffickers 
of the estimated 500000plus drug addicts in mexico the 
federal attorney generals office says 300000 use inhalants 
200000 use marijuana 30000 use cocaine and the rest use heroin 
or opium 
people working in prevention and rehabilitation programs worry 
about the increased use of inhalants 
money determines the drug of choice in a nation whose minimum 
wage is equivalent to 360 a day 
we are a poor country said martha nelda morales assistant 
director of the adolescent orientation center a health service 
group we are trying to satisfy our basic needs like food 
clothing and shelter 
a half pint of paint thinner costs 7 cents and a tube of glue 
107 it is illegal to sell either to anyone under 18 but 
enforcement is lax 
street prices for marijuana and cocaine respectively are about 
180 a cigarette and 35 a gram 
they give it away a 14yearold user named jose said of 
inhalants he was walking in garibaldi plaza a tourist area of 
curio shops bars and food stands where mariachis play for tips 
inhalants can cause permanent damage to the brain liver lungs 
and stomach but jose and other users show little concern about 
that 
it takes away my hunger my sleepiness and my problems jose 
said gripping a tiny container of paint thinner ill stop when 
i get older 
some people say a higher morality has kept hard drugs from 
getting a strong hold on this overwhelmingly roman catholic nation 
the concept of the family is stronger ms morales said 
dr raul zapata aguilar medical director for the national youth 
integration centers said a decision to focus on prevention had 
made the difference 
twenty years ago mexico decided the only way to stem the tide 
of drug use was to stem the demand for drugs he said 
most mexican drug programs do not use the fear themes popular in 
the united states such as drugs kill 
zapata believes the appeal to fear has only a shortterm effect 
its like speeding on a highway and seeing an accident he 
said you will slow down for the next five miles but eventually 
you will speed up again 
the usual mexican approach is to deemphasize drugs and teach 
adolescents parents and teachers how to achieve a healthy 
emotional family and physical life 
advertisements show young people river rafting for example 
with the words say yes to life across the top in large letters 
and say no to drugs in smaller print on the bottom 
directaction programs organize activities like weight lifting 
street theater poetry workshops and sports teams in poorer 
neighborhoods to keep children away from narcotics 
a roman catholic priest known as father chimchachoma runs 
providence house he collects kids from the street and takes them 
to one of its 15 homes where they can live until they finish 
school or learn a trade 
one morning he told three new arrivals of a diamond left in a 
muddy field passersby ignored the dirty seemingly worthless 
object he said but someone finally picked it up and washed it 
and what did he find the priest asked 
a diamond the boys shouted in unison 
and what are you 
diamonds

theres a moment in alan lomaxs wonderful 
american patchwork series on pbs when you understand the 
incredible power of cultural forces and the ingenuity of his 
anthropologists vision 
lomax takes us to a joyous new orleans neighborhood parade at 
carnival time when black men don gorgeously ornate mardi gras 
indian costumes and take to the streets for ritual dance duels 
with rival tribes 
he shows us their regalia and littleknown rituals and then 
almost casually his video camera tilts down to show their feet 
which slide along to the music in a distinctive groundhugging 
step 
they he cuts to a shot of bare feet dancing the identical step 
the camera pulled back to reveal the dancers of a west african 
village street parade 
it is a thoughtful clever touch immutable as chromosomes that 
gliding groundhugging dance step has come here from africa and 
has survived intact for hundreds of years in the proud cultural 
heritage of black americans 
african culture arrived here along the nonverbal route he 
explains deprived of language it kept its body language its 
enormously rich oral and nonverbal traditions 
the final episode of his fine fivepart series airs tonight on 
pbs like the others its filled with music color stories and 
songs from the patchwork quilt of american culture that somehow is 
more than the sum of its parts 
the human species for 90000 years has devoted itself to 
communications systems to music dance songs said lomax who 
with his father john a lomax compiled the library of congress 
distinguished archive of american folk song 
now that its beginning to slip away from us it begins to 
look mighty precious he said 
the series second episode explored the musical traditions of 
southwest louisianas vital cajun culture from the rowdy 
horseback gathering of the communitys mardi gras gumbo to its 
pastoralist origins in western france 
the third episode the land where blues began was a moving 
look at the music of the mississippi delta what lomax calls the 
powerful bitter poetry of an oppressed people 
lomax interviews the mule skinners who hauled the earth to build 
the mississippi river levees to hear the work songs and 
hollers they sing is to see the human face of a fundamentally 
american music its powerful stuff 
appalachian journey followed the britons who settled the 
eastern mountains where the isolation gave their heritage time 
to reorganize itself and led to the creation of bluegrass music 
our first genuine folk orchestra 
the final episode dreams and songs of the noble old 
features elderly balladeers and musicians who pass their music to 
the young 
its not preservation its process lomax said its 
keeping things going 
lomax a research associate in anthropology for columbia 
university and hunter college believes that our centralized 
electronic communications system is imposing standardized 
massproduced and cheapened cultures everywhere 
human beings and human affairs he says are 90 percent 
cultural our cultures give us ways of thinking feeling 
communicating and adapting to our environment that are unique to 
human beings 
if those absolutely important things are ignored of how we 
speciated how we adapted to the planet then were going to lose 
something precious he said there wont be anywhere to go and 
no place to come home to 
american patchwork is a joint production of the university 
of north carolina center for public television the national 
endowment for the artss media program the corporation for public 
broadcasting and pbs 
although the series wraps up friday night check your local 
listings carefully north carolina public tv spokeswoman chancy 
kapp said the success of the show was such that local rebroadcasts 
and even a pbs repeat may be in the cards

lindiwe phillip an 
antiapartheid activist fled into exile and expected to return 
triumphantly in a few months that was 14 years ago 
she came home in june when the government granted temporary 
amnesty to dozens of african national congress leaders so they 
could return and prepare for talks on ending apartheid the racial 
policy that gives 5 million whites supremacy over the nations 28 
million blacks 
ms phillip now 32 was among thousands of young blacks who 
left after the the 1976 student uprisings hundreds of people were 
killed in 1976 and the uprising helped shape a generation of 
militant activists 
i thought exile would be very temporary about three 
months she said as time went on i had to grapple with the 
fact that i am in exile and that i can no longer go home 
the anc south africas leading black opposition movement has 
an estimated 20000 members in exile and their return is one of the 
main obstacles to negotiations on powersharing between blacks and 
whites 
while ms phillip was in exile in zambia her parents died 
after she was in touch with her brother about the deaths he was 
killed and then her younger brother was found stabbed to death 
she still does not know who killed either of them 
i was just heartbroken she said i was almost on the 
verge of going nuts crazy 
during her exile ms phillip received military training and 
studied in cuba and tanzania she also worked in the anc womens 
section and the department of information and publicity in lusaka 
zambia the ancs exile headquarters 
her feelings were mixed when she returned in june with a group 
sent to recruit members for the anc womens league 
we had so longed to be back home but at the same time we were 
not sure it was the correct time she said 
african national congress members began trickling out of south 
africa when the organization was banned in 1960 
president fw de klerk lifted the 30year ban in february but 
the anc has been hesitant to arrange a mass return of exiles 
without a guarantee of immunity from prosecution 
a law passed in february empowers de klerk to grant immunity 
but so far he has given only temporary amnesty to a few dozen anc 
leaders and officials 
anc and government delegations met for the first time in may and 
have been working on a document that would allow all exiles to 
return 
mathews phosa a lawyer who is in the anc delegation fled south 
africa five years ago when he was told his life was in danger but 
had to leave his wife and 3yearold daughter behind 
it is one of the most traumatic decisions one could take in 
ones life a very very painful experience shattering 
terrible he said 
what sustained exiles phosa said was unshakeable belief in the 
struggle to end apartheid 
you dont know where you are going to exactly he said 
you are being uprooted from your loved ones you know you are 
going to comrades but thats not enough you still have to make 
new friends 
after the initial shock life in exile becomes normal the 
lawyer said people get married they fall in love they work 
and home is not something that haunts you every day 
finding a place to live is a major problem for returning exiles 
there is a severe shortage of housing for blacks 
many will want to catch up on education they missed while 
fighting for spear of the nation the anc military wing but black 
schools are overcrowded qualified teachers are rare and violence 
has disrupted classes for years 
recent rightwing violence against blacks and against whites 
opposed to apartheid is a source of fear for returning exiles 
phosa said but that cant be a reason for us not to come home 
with the political space being there to organize and build our 
organization it would be irresponsible for us not to deploy our 
cadres inside the country he said 
i think i am optimistic that we will get over the stumbling 
blocks there is a willingness on the part of the government they 
are very slow hesitant but i think they are moving forward and 
they should be credited for that

in one day the defense minister was 
replaced and 143 officers retired it was peaceful unlike many 
military changes in latin america but some venezuelans wonder how 
long that will contine 
similar promotions and retirements have occurred often in 
venezuelas 32 years as one of the stablest democracies of latin 
america with no problems or thought of a coup 
fears of the military taking a hand arise now because of an 
economic crisis that never seems to ease a sharp increase in crime 
and reports of corruption scandals involving billions of dollars 
a dozen prominent members of the governing democratic action 
party were cleared of corruption charges by the partys executive 
committee which caused a storm of protest from opposition and 
independent politicians 
on july 11 a public court issued arrest warrants on corruption 
charges for 12 other democratic action leaders including former 
interior minister jose angel ciliberto all went into hiding before 
police arrived and most are believed to have left the country 
jose vicente rangel a political analyst and former congressman 
said on a television program that a coup was possible even after 
such a long period of democracy 
he quoted surveys conducted by organizations of the utmost 
reliability as indicating 20 percent of venezuelans openly 
favored a military takeover and another 20 percent were indifferent 
venezuelans always supported democracy but now democracy is 
being associated with evils committed by political parties and 
politicians he told an associated press reporter the surveys 
mean four out of 10 venezuelans are potential supporters of a coup 
detat 
luis herrera campins a social christian who was president in 
197883 said democracy in venezuela is not 100 percent 
guaranteed especially if dissatisfaction and social protest 
keep growing 
others see coup rumors as a warning but not a real possibility 
it could be a way to wish evil on the thing blamed for so many 
frustrations the government said teodoro petkoff of the 
socialist movement party 
venezuelan leaders learned early last year that dissatisfaction 
can turn to violence at least 300 people were killed in riots 
after president carlos andres perez administered an economic shock 
treatment that included raising bus fares 30 percent and ending 
food subsidies 
perez slowed the program because of the riots and after 18 
months 72 percent of venezuelans still spend 70 percent of their 
incomes on food 
unemployment is slightly more than 10 percent by official 
figures but at least 14 percent according to labor unions when 
the underemployed are added the rate is well above 50 percent 
the bloated bureacracy has not been affected however it 
provides jobs for 12 million venezuelans or 20 percent of the 
nations labor force 
at least 30 percent of our population suffers from 
malnutrition said jose curiel a member of congress from the 
opposition social christians our hospitals simply dont work 
water is scarce public services are collapsing in its attempt 
at economic reform the government said most of the 400odd public 
companies would be sold quickly to private investors those 
companies are blamed for most of the nations 35 billion foreign 
debt and chronic deficits estimated at up to 2 billion annually 
no significant company has yet been sold partly due to fears of 
massive layoffs and labor unrest 
stateowned companies provide jobs for members of political 
parties mainly democratic action and the social christians and 
are a major base of union power the venezuelan labor confederation 
recently warned the government against layoffs at the main steel 
plant which has 18000 employees 
technical studies say at least 3000 should be dismissed if the 
plant is to stop losing money unions describe the studies as 
socially and politically destabilizing 
many venezuelans see increasing crime as an outgrowth of 
unemployment 
in two recent cases thieves killed the son of a former 
government minister and gunmen took over the home of the argentine 
ambassador 
tony bianchi editor of the daily journal in caracas said 25 of 
the newspapers 80 staff members had been attacked in recent months 
they included jules waldman the founder and chairman who died 
of injuries inflicted by thieves who invaded his home in june 
waldman 77 was a new yorker who spent more than 40 years in 
venezuela 
robberies and killings have become so frequent rangel said 
that venezuelan society is defenseless nobody is safe not even 
at home and streets are a trap for all

every malay who is anybody has a 
title from the duli yang maha mulia seri paduka baginda yang 
dipertuan agong thats the king to each haji and hajah who 
makes the moslem pilgrimage to mecca 
tun tan seri and datuk are among the many hereditary or 
conferred titles borne by leading citizens 
proper ways of addressing a malay are diverse and complicated 
family names are relatively unimportant as long as the title is 
used correctly improper usage may cause offense 
some titles are gained at birth others given as rewards for 
service to government or nation to the ordinary encik mister 
titles and forms of address can be confusing 
the kings title means approximately his most glorious 
majesty who is raised most high in english your majesty is 
usually enough the queen or seri baginda raja permaisuri agong 
also is your majesty 
malaysia is unique in having a monarchy that rotates among royal 
families nine of the 13 states have royal families whose leaders 
take turns being king of the entire nation for five years 
passing the throne around solved a sticky protocol problem when 
malaysia shed colonial ties with britain in 1957 none of the nine 
state rulers would have been accepted by the other eight as 
permanent king and tunku abdul rahman who was prime minister 
divised the method of sharing glory 
children of the state rulers usually are called tunku or tengku 
loosely equivalent to prince or princess tunku rahman for 
example is of royal descent 
niks and megats are those with royal blood on the mothers side 
syeds and their female counterparts sharifahs claim to be 
directly descended from the prophet mohammed from royal families 
of the malay archipelago or both 
a man honored for distinguished service to the nation becomes a 
tun and his wife a toh puan the title is malaysias highest order 
of chivalry limited to 25 living men 
when prime minister dato seri dr mahathir mohamad retires 
officials say he probably will become tun mahathir he is a 
medical doctor and was made a dato seri years ago for his 
contributions to public life 
the nonhereditary title tan seri is given to the recipient of 
either of malaysias two secondhighest orders of chivalry for 
nonroyals 
datuks and the variants datuk seri and dato are numerous and 
their wives are datins the title is nonhereditary and its basic 
meaning is grandfather 
in higher social circles practically everybody is a datuk 
whether malay chinese or indian 
a common compliment is to call a man dato before he has been so 
designated few object except the very modest 
the highlight of the kings official birthday celebrated on the 
first wednesday of june is the conferment of hundreds of awards 
and titles hundreds more are issued each year by the 13 states 
with datuk in the majority 
tuan means sir in malay and is used informally to address an 
elderly person or someone of prominence or wealth tuan yang 
terutama the malay translation of excellency is applied to heads 
of diplomatic missions and the governors of the four states without 
royal families 
puan or madame often is used to refer to married women a 
single women is called cik 
haji and hajah are the titles for men and women who have made a 
pilgrimage or haj to mecca and performed certain acts required on 
a pilgrimage 
in malay usage bin means son of and binte means daughter 
of the part of the name before it is the given name and the 
part after is the name of the persons father 
names can be as confusing as titles the prime minister is 
mahathir mohamad the information minister is mohamed rahmat and 
thousands of others spell the name mohamat muhamat muhhammad and 
even mohd 
in 1988 the goverment decreed the official version of the 
prophets name to be muhammad those already born and named with 
other spellings were excused from compliance

in the world of advertising dentsu is king in 
japan its also a kingmaker 
dentsu which grew out of japans wartime propaganda machine 
controls most government public relations and the largest chunk of 
all domestic advertising 
but critics charge dentsu also controls peoples minds an 
accusation that isnt exactly refuted by the companys own 
corporate credo manipulate those around you in the end the 
manipulative rise way above the manipulated 
i cant think of any other institution in the world that has 
the kind of molding power in society that dentsu does said karel 
van wolferen author of the enigma of japanese power 
the way in which the firm uses its power underscores the role of 
big coporations in general in postwar japan 
large japanese corporations have a certain interest in 
social control theres a strong sense of responsibility to 
maintain the social order said wolferen a dutch journalist who 
has lived in japan for 25 years 
one recent example of dentsus powers came last year when the 
nation was preparing for its first sales tax although the loudest 
protests against the levy came from housewives dentsu eye a 
dentsu subsidiary that focuses on the womans point of view 
promoted the tax 
this was because a group of dentsu eye executives came to a 
personal decision that the consumption tax was necessary said 
naoe wakita dentsu eye president 
her company designed a newspaper campaign that featured finance 
minister ryutaro hashimoto because he is considered handsome 
soliciting womens opinions on the tax 
the once vigorous movement to revise the tax has all but died 
dentsu with an army of 6000 employees and earnings last year 
of 131 billion bills itself as a total communications company 
involved in market research product testing sales promotion 
public relations megaevent planning and media brokering 
what the companys slick brochures dont say is that dentsu 
dominates the mass media in japan through its interlocking web of 
subsidiaries and contractors which among other things produce 
television programs and the ratings for those programs 
to an american that sounds like having your hand in the 
cookie jar but its common for large japanese companies to be 
affiliated with many other companies said caroline yamashita an 
american who worked at dentsus tokyo headquarters for two years 
dentsu spokesman ken kusuhara said dentsu grew up in the 
postwar period with todays large corporations so its natural that 
theres a close connection between us were like children who grew 
up together 
dentsus influence with the media is striking texas oilman t 
boone pickens recently tried to place ads in major japanese 
newspapers accusing toyota motor corp and other automakers of 
forcing high prices on consumers through collusive business 
practices 
pickens claimed that dentsu on client toyotas behalf used its 
clout with the media to block the ads his lawyer kanji ishizumi 
said dentsu told one of the newspapers that members of the japan 
automobile manufacturers association were very concerned about 
the ad appearing in newspapers 
the ads as originally submitted by pickens named toyota 
nissan motor co ltd and honda motor co ltd as the collusive 
culprits but when they were published a week after pickens went 
public with his charges the carmakers names were missing 
dentsu executive director teruyoshi kastsurada dismisses 
pickens charges dentsu does not have that kind of power and 
japanese newspapers are not so weak in their editorial positions 
that they would accept whatever dentsu tells them to do he said 
but japanese magazines have also accused dentsu of strictly 
controlling news reports of milk contaminated by a major client and 
reports of deaths linked to a cold medicine made by a client 
a dentsu executive boasted in a 1971 speech that japans largest 
newspaper the yomiuri shimbun after having invited consumer 
advocate ralph nader to japan heeded a warning from dentsu by 
toning down coverage of the visit that executive shohei kogure 
is now dentsus president 
dentsu handles close to 25 percent of all advertising budgets in 
japan placing more than 20 percent of ads in major newspapers and 
major chunks of advertising in magazines and on prime time 
television 
dentsus influence also extends to tv and the big screen the 
company and its affiliates produce a number of highprofile tv 
programs and movies it often uses the stars to offer clients 
advertising tieins merchandise sales and other promotional 
opportunities 
then theres dentsus role as a media broker it buys blocks of 
media time and sells it to advertisers thereby deciding who can 
sponsor a tv program and when 
for public relations work dentsu has been the top choice of the 
longruling liberal democratic party since japans first general 
election after the us occupation 
part of the companys power stems from its onetime merger with 
the monopolistic domei news service which churned out government 
propaganda between 1936 and 1945 of japans two major news 
agencies today kyodo news service owns 283 percent of dentsu 
stock and jiji press owns 201 percent 
with 90 percent of its business in japan dentsus one weakness 
is a lack of international experience observers say 
but the company has expansion plans since 1987 it has operated 
in 19 countries as hdm in partnership with us advertising giant 
young amp rubicam inc and frances eurocom it also formed a joint 
venture in 1988 with the american public relations firm 
bursonmarsteller 
dentsu executives say they want to expand into countries where 
their clients mostly japanese companies that have gone 
multinational are doing business

the electrical worker from czechoslovakia says 
he must have met a hundred americans in his 2 months in america 
but everyone was too busy to become real friends 
whenever he talked to the owner of the virginia publishing 
company where he interned i was seeing that the time was running 
in his head 
the young lawyer from poland bemoaned americans lack of 
knowledge about europe or even about america 
in an afterhours competition with his fellow summer clerks at a 
prestigious washington law firm he was able to name 45 states of 
the union the best any of his new harvardeducated friends could 
do was 36 or 37 
these young east europeans a translator a civil engineer a 
law professor a legal advisor to the hungarian parliament a 
polish radio and television worker and others many of them with a 
history of dissidence had been in america since midmay learning 
the ropes of capitalism and democracy 
they worked in banks in bookstores in congressional offices 
and state government chiefly in washington and north carolina 
sidebyside with american counterparts in a program run by the 
nonprofit national forum foundation recently they spent the 
morning discussing what they liked what they disliked and what 
surprised them 
piotr kochanski 28 a lawyer was the pole who outshined the 
other summer clerks at hogan amp hartson by listing 45 states and 
all the presidents of the us in the 20th century he played 
softball with the firms young lawyers but found it a boring 
game 
what dismayed him was how little americans in turn knew about 
europe they know nothing about our country our history our 
culture he said 
i was asked very funny questions many times agreed mirek 
kleber a novice polish businessman who speaks russian french and 
german and interned with a bank in lumberton nc do we have 
television in poland do we have cars 
on the other hand kochanski marveled americans can organize 
something in an hour everybody has confidence in the others 
everybody can trust one another i love it this ability for 
working together 
and he was struck by how americans can tear down a perfectly 
fine building and in two months a new beautiful building can go 
up 
we have all this history in poland he said i love this 
history but i think we can learn from your creativity your 
pragmatism this modern mentality 
i am from a city one thousand years old said beata 
kalczynskagasic a civil engineer from krakow in raleigh nc 
where she worked with the state department of transportation she 
was shown a picture of the city what struck her was that no 
building was more than 40 years old 
americans seem to be running toward the future and dont look 
back she said but she asked where is the soul in your 
cities 
kalliope bakirdzi 31 press secretary for a new political party 
in hungary the alliance of free democrats worked in the office of 
the lieutenant governor of north carolina and observed the 
democratic senate primary campaign 
she liked the civility of american politics the acceptance of 
compromise 
whatever you are republican or democrat you know there 
will always be republicans and democrats and you have to get along 
with the other side she said 
in hungary she said we hate each other much more than is 
needed for normal political life 
she was impressed too that american politicians can spend 80 
percent of their time talking to meeting dealing with the voters 
our politicians never cared about the people she said 
but she was puzzled by the fuss over flagburning in this 
country 
recalling a television news report she said she was a little 
shocked how they allowed the ku klux klan to march but they try to 
ban burning the flag if you burn a flag you dont hurt anybody 
but the ku klux klan can hurt people 
daria golebiowska 22 advertising director for a warsaw fashion 
house interned at roll call a capitol hill newspaper she liked 
the way people assumed responsibility without direction 
everybodys working away she said describing a newsrooms 
chaos everything seems to be so loose people are coming in and 
out and talking on the telephone and suddenly a newspaper comes 
out 
this responsibility for their own work gives people a feeling 
they are really important 
jan lamper 35 a czechoslovak worker at an electrical plant 
translator and former dissident said he thinks americans work too 
hard much harder than he expected his friendships didnt have 
time to develop 
people are too busy to get involved deeper he said 
theyre working all the time 
andrzej slaski 35 a sanitary engineer from poland was struck 
by the friendliness of the people of raleigh 
a lot of people in the street say hello good morning 
hi he said in poland he said that would happen only in a 
village 
and he couldnt get over of the purity of the water that emerged 
from the modern north carolina sewerage treatment plant he had 
visited 998 percent pure cleaner than river water he kept 
saying 998 percent clean 
gabor nagy 29 legal adviser to hungarys alliance of young 
democrats and teacher of sociology worked in a congressmans 
office and told of seeing how easily someone was fired for 
incompetence he wasnt dismayed 
thats good he exclaimed this is a competitive society 
our society was too egalitarian socialist 
nagy marvelled at the separation of powers the disdain of the 
legislative branch toward the executive branch of government 
peoples attitude toward power is not to obey he said it 
is almost a kind of distrust of power lawmaking is always a 
compromise negotiations between different factions finding a 
common answer this is very inspiring

darlanne fluegel was about to accept another 
series offer from nbc when she heard a new partner was being sought 
for fred dryer on hunter 
it had to happen for me very fast she said if not id 
have to accept the other show i knew this was going to be my role 
i went into the meeting and pow i got it fred was very 
supportive he went with me to the network to audition 
fluegel plays officer joanne molenski a member of the los 
angeles police departments metro squad and sgt rick hunters new 
partner she replaces stepfanie kramer who quit her role as sgt 
dee dee mccall after six seasons 
its probably a good thing fluegel got the role the other show 
hasnt yet shown up on the nbc schedule 
fluegel a former model played dennis farinas wife in the nbc 
series crime story and has been in such movies as once upon 
a time in america the eyes of laura mars to live and die 
in la tough guys and freeway 
she was cast in hunter after returning from canada and a 
guest role on cbs wiseguy 
there are so few good interesting roles for women on 
television she said you have to take whats available and 
make it interesting i told myself if a role comes along with 
screen time im going to take it this was it 
i like the feeling at hunter its like working with 
friends too often when you walk on a set its every man for 
himself 
in the upcoming fall season hunter has been transferred from 
homicide to the metro squad where hes teamed up with molenski 
fred and i will work out how our partnership goes she said 
we didnt want it to be the typical i dont like you you dont 
like me all of a sudden were friends thing i think a lot of 
relationships depend on the day they can bounce a lot of ways 
itll be strictly a professional relationship because a policeman 
has to know that he can depend on his partner 
being in the metro squad will allow us to work on a wide 
variety of cases not just homicides she said 
before beginning her role fluegel spent time talking to women 
police officers and riding with them on patrol 
ive never played a police officer before she said i 
went to several different police departments because i wanted to 
see how different police forces handled things im usually on the 
other side of the law i was a cops wife on crime story on 
wiseguy i was a madam 
fluegel grew up in wilkesbarre pa and binghamton ny 
where she wanted to be an actress before she even started school 
once i almost said i wanted to be an actress but i knew id 
be ridiculed she said so i said ballerina in high school i 
was so shy i never even considered going out for school plays my 
aspiration was to go to london i graduated high school early so i 
could go to new york london was a little out of my reach all i 
had was fare to new york 
fluegel studied acting in new york and worked as a model with 
the ford agency her first film role was in the eyes of laura 
mars in which she played a model 
i got a lot of offers she said but dramatic darlane was 
a stella adler student and said no to everything i was such a 
snob i expected the roles to be better i wouldnt play roles 
where they treated women in a demeaning way i didnt like the way 
they treated women in la here baby ive got a script for 
you 
when i finally did move to los angeles it was after spending 
four months in japan i wanted to get away from all influences id 
just ended a relationship i gave up acting 
that was seven years ago now she lives on a fiveacre horse 
ranch with her husband actor michael moore whom she met in an 
acting class they have a 2yearold daughter jenna carey 
in addition to her new role in hunter fluegel will be 
before audiences in the notyetreleased movie no cause for

marie is a 33yearold school teacher and 
the mother of two young boys she is happily married lives in a 
cozy twostory house loves children and has had an abortion 
it was a painful choice but it was the only choice said 
marie whose husband supported her decision 
when louisianas legislature voted last month to foreclose that 
choice passing what would have been the nations toughest abortion 
law marie and others were forced to examine life before and after 
abortion was legalized 
many for the first time imagined what they their daughters and 
granddaughters would do if the option no longer existed 
their vigils marches petitions and letters reached gov buddy 
roemer and his veto secured abortion rights at least momentarily 
louisiana lawmakers are pondering an override and abortion 
rights supporters are apprehensive 
weve been fighting for our lives marie said 
marie who like others interviewed for this story spoke on 
condition of anonymity was the victim of protracted childhood 
incest with the birth of each of her sons longsuppressed 
memories crept closer to the surface 
the freshscrubbed redhead became increasingly depressed and 
alcoholic her home near this small town about 25 miles from new 
orleans became a cage in which she sat sometimes cradling her 
husbands revolver 
doctors warned that a third child could trigger irreversible 
psychosis 
it wasnt anything either of us wanted to do but we already 
had two children who needed a father and a mother her husband 
said she couldnt have come out of another pregnancy without 
permanent damage to her psyche 
she had the abortion four years ago had the bill initially 
proposed by louisiana lawmakers been law at the time the doctor 
who performed maries abortion would have faced up to 10 years in 
prison and fines of up to 100000 
the original bill made no exceptions for rape or incest roemer 
vetoed it the second bill excepted pregnancies caused by 
aggravated rape and incest reported to police and a physician 
within a week roemer rejected it as well some commonsense 
decent exceptions should be made he said 
the legislature is considering whether to reconvene for a 
firstever emergency override session aug 18 some lawmakers have 
proposed trying to revive the first bill but the states 
constitution may prohibit the move 
while they sympathize with the plights of women like marie 
opponents of abortion in this heavily roman catholic and 
fundamentalist state are pressing the legislature to override they 
say its a mistake for women to assume that terminating a 
problematic pregnancy will ease their despair 
abortion is not solving anything said phyllis osborne who 
today still regrets the illegal abortion she underwent in 1970 
we have to get to the heart of the problem of why a woman chooses 
abortion because she feels she has no alternative 
antiabortion activists offer adoption as an alternative that 
protects both the mother and her unborn child 
with abortion there are two victims the baby is killed and 
the woman is wounded said linda jefferson who cannot bear 
children 
the 37yearold woman had an hysterectomy more than a decade ago 
following complications from the second of two abortions 
i was ignorant immature and very uneducated about abortion 
said jefferson who founded a pregnancy counseling service 
affiliated with the roman catholic church two years ago 
abortion providers tell women it doesnt hurt but it does hurt 
emotionally spiritually and physically 
other women such as the victims of rape or incest say the 
wounds already inflicted could go no deeper 
jacquelyns 15yearold daughter was raped last year the mother 
knew members of her interdenominational church in a baton rouge 
suburb would not approve but abortion was the only way to keep her 
baby from having a baby 
her virginity was taken from her i didnt want her life taken 
too said jacquelyn she herself is a 34yearold single mother 
who until recently was living on about 130 a month in government 
aid 
her daughter has plans shes always wanted to be a doctor 
the pregnancy would have shattered that dream said jacquelyn 
if she were being permissive maybe i wouldnt have considered 
abortion but under the circumstances i felt we felt it was the 
only choice 
jacquelyn said nothing could have stopped her from finding her 
daughter help somewhere somehow if abortions had been 
outlawed in louisiana she might have taken the girl to mississippi 
or florida 
thats if she could have scraped money together to make the 
trip many women who could not afford that option would likely 
resort to the illegal and dangerous methods that prevailed prior to 
the supreme courts 1973 roe vs wade decision which restricted 
the right of the states to outlaw abortion 
a ban on abortions would just make them deadly said dorothy 
west 69 
she remembers how it was in 1950 the year she nearly bled to 
death following an illegal abortion 
dorothy was a young mother of two trying to run her deceased 
husbands bulldozing business when she discovered she was pregnant 
by a man she would later marry she tried every way she knew how to 
induce a miscarriage quinine scalding baths gin and pills 
prescribed by backalley doctors 
i dont believe in baby killing said the roman catholic 
grandmother im not even for capital punishment but my back was 
against the wall and i was frightened i was thinking about the two 
children already living 
three decades later her 35yearold daughter velvet west also 
had an abortion she too cited concerns for the three children she 
already had 
her father dorothys third husband was an alcoholic given 
to furniturethrowing rages she felt those same impulses herself 
and she was frightened 
i was afraid i would hurt my own children said velvet she 
had an abortion sought counseling and has since remarried and had 
another son it was the best parenting decision i ever made i 
was a ticking time bomb 
not all women cite rape or psychological scars as reason for 
abortions abortion opponents says the procedure is too often a 
form of birth control a quick fix in the words of linda 
jefferson 
michelle 25 has ended four accidental pregnancies with 
abortions two were out of irresponsibility two were failed 
birth control she said 
if i hadnt had access i would have tried to selfabort 
or suicide she said blowing cigarette smoke into the rafters of 
the new orleans nightclub where she works i did not want to be a 
mother at 17 
and such choices said norma mccorvey are what the battle is 
all about 
mccorvey a native of louisiana is known in the legal canon as 
jane roe the woman whose challenge ultimately overturned the 
nations abortion laws though she herself carried her child to 
term and gave her up for adoption 
mccorvey 42 traveled from her home in california to baton 
rouge to join the fight against the louisiana bill she feels the 
hands of time being turned back on her supreme court victory 
it hurts it hurts real bad she says 
its not like anybody is proabortion but a lot of women 
really arent capable of raising children she said 
i didnt have a choice

a whiff of perfume or a breeze from the 
neighbors lawn can leave chemically sensitive people speechless 
and they are becoming increasingly vocal about it 
they complain theyre getting sick very sick from everyday 
exposure to common levels of chemicals in the home office and 
environment 
chemical sensitivity can leave sufferers vulnerable to 
headaches burning in the throat and lungs and a paralyzing 
disorientation that can render one incapable of speaking 
skeptics in the insurance medical and chemical industries say 
they are not convinced the misery isnt all in the sufferers 
heads the condition has yet to win recognition in those circles 
or the insurance benefits that would result 
but some scientists insist society is seeing the first 
casualties of the proliferation of chemicals since world war ii 
annual us production of synthetic organic chemicals has exploded 
from less than 1 billion pounds to 273 billion by 1988 
these may indeed be the canaries said claudia miller a 
university of texas health science center allergist and 
immunologist who cowrote a study on the malady for the department 
of health of new jersey the state with the nations secondbiggest 
chemical industry behind texas 
we dont understand the mechanisms she said it may be 
neurological or immunological it may be biochemical 
whatever the mechanism the effect can be dramatic say experts 
and those who suffer from chemical sensitivity also known as 
environmental illness 
the illness often begins with a single exposure installation 
of a new carpet in the office or an accidental release of toxic 
materials from a sewage plant that seems to traumatize the body 
into a permanent hypersensitive state sufferers say 
what follows is a bewildering array of symptoms and a search for 
diagnosis and treatment patients try to avoid contact with the 
pesticides plastics and building materials they fear will trigger 
an episode 
some sufferers find breathing relief with use of adrenaline but 
drugs are not too useful because many sufferers react to 
pharmaceuticals 
how many people are affected still is unknown 
according to the new jersey report the national academy of 
sciences suggested about 15 percent of the population has 
heightened sensitivity to chemicals though fewer people face 
intense symptoms but an academy spokeswoman later said the 
estimate was offthecuff and should not have been cited by the 
authors 
the medical establishment remains dubious 
psychiatrist carroll brodsky of the university of california 
san francisco who has written extensively on the subject said it 
is more likely a psychological disability 
if you believe you couldnt walk outside or walk anywhere 
where there were exhaust fumes you would be disabled if that is 
the issue have i seen people like this who are disabled 
certainly brodsky said 
now whether they have anything wrong with them physically is 
quite another matter if physical doctors cant find anything 
physically wrong with them it must be within the realm of the 
psyche 
some credible neutral organizations have given at least some 
credence to a physical basis for the disorder 
the environmental protection agency in a report to congress on 
indoor air pollution urges financing for research on chemical 
sensitivity the congressional research service calls chemical 
sensitivity one of the consequences of poor indoor air quality 
and the federal department of housing and urban development has 
ruled that people with environmental illness who live in subsidized 
housing cannot be forced to have their homes exterminated with 
chemicals 
some doubters blame malingering employees aiming for workers 
compensation benefits they also point to sufferers subconscious 
fear of workplace pressures and to fright over frequent media 
reports about chemicals 
clinical ecologists doctors who specialize in chemical 
sensitivity also have met with skepticism mainstream allergists 
for example have urged the health care financing administration to 
deny reimbursement for clinical ecologists work 
but ms miller and her coauthor on the new jersey report 
contend the psychological explanation ignores the stunning 
similarity of triggering exposures and symptoms reported 
theyre all so diverse yet theyre all coming up with the 
same thing is it all psychological when everyone is coming up with 
the same symptoms they ask 
she and coauthor nicholas ashford of the massachusetts 
institute of technology agree that more research is needed 
among dozens of proposals to federal and state governments they 
want to set up an environmental unit a contaminantfree 
chamber in which subjects would be placed and observed as chemicals 
were introduced 
new jersey officials have not said what recommendations if any 
they will follow 
so far the scientists have found four groups of people most 
prone to chemical sensitivity they are industrial workers 
occupants of wellinsulated poorly ventilated offices residents 
of contaminated communities and people exposed to chemicals in 
household air 
it is widespread in nature and is not limited to what some 
observers would describe as malingering workers hysterical 
housewives and workers experiencing mass psychogenic illness the 
report says 
believers in chemical sensitivity as a physical illness say the 
skeptics fear an ominous message if people are getting sick from 
the chemicalladen world it bodes ill for a huge industry 
it might mean constructing buildings with better ventilation 
settling for a lessthanperfect lawn or scrubbing toilets with 
baking soda 
and an industry briefing paper warns more formal recognition 
of chemical sensitivity could bring a torrent of lawsuits and 
insurance obligations 
the primary impact on society would be the huge cost 
associated with the legitimization of environmental illness says 
the paper by the chemical manufacturers association 
it would mean we had a new and very different problem to deal 
with said gordon strickland a chemical manufacturers 
association vice president but we have looked through the data 
and looked through the arguments and found nothing supportive 
of a physical explanation 
mary lamielle a chemical sensitivity sufferer from voorhees 
nj and leader of a national group working for official 
recognition of the condition said economics more than science is 
behind the industry skepticism 
lamielle pressured her state senator lee laskin who in turn 
got the department of health to do the study her group has roughly 
2000 members mostly sufferers

the center of the viking world 1000 years 
ago is under siege by archaeologists who are trying to pry secrets 
from beneath the pastures that now cover this farming island 
historians believe that birka a settlement on an island in lake 
maleren just west of stockholm was home to about 1000 people the 
site now is covered with grids in which workers dig by hand 
through the seven feet of dirt covering the settlement 
two sections have been excavated since the dig began this spring 
and although the findings have not been startling they hint at a 
wealth of artifacts to come the project is to last until 1994 
animal bones remnants of meals colorful beads combs and 
household utensils that could shed light on viking home life have 
turned up archaeologists also found arab coins evidence of how 
the vikings roamed 
the vikings thrived from the late 8th century to the 11th 
century their raids struck terror throughout europe and their 
spirit of adventure drove them far afield to iceland and north 
america 
birka has been recognized since the middle ages as the cradle of 
christianity in sweden it was here that ansgar a missionary from 
bremen and later bishop of bremenhamburg first preached around 
830 
but while some viking towns flourished birka was deserted at 
the end of the first millennium where traders once exchanged goods 
from all of the known world sheep graze in meadows and on grassy 
mounds containing the graves of viking traders 
historians say vikings from the birka region a people known 
then as rus sailed eastward across the baltic sea and lent their 
name to the land of russia they reached the caspian sea 
although birka was the vikings center it has remained mostly 
unexamined while extensive digs were conducted at viking 
settlements in york england dublin ireland hedeby west 
germany kaupang norway and staraya ladoga soviet union 
the viking era generally is regarded as having begun in 792 the 
year a raiding party attacked the lindisfarne monastery on 
britains north sea coast but evidence could be uncovered 
indicating that the era began earlier said bjorn ambrosiani of 
stockholms museum of national history 
the only previous excavation of birka was conducted 100 years 
ago by hjalmar stolpe a zoologist who came in search of insect 
fossils in 1871 and stayed 24 years to dig up many of the 2500 
viking age graves 
stolpe touched very little of the town of birka which stood at 
the focus of a heroic chapter in scandinavian history ambrosiani 
and other experts are eager to find out how it was built and 
developed 
the project is being financed by one of swedens richest men 
industrialist gad rausing 
if you go digging you should have proper resources otherwise 
you do more damage than good ambrosiani said 
rausing who has a doctorate in archaeology said he pursuaded 
the board of directors of his familys tetrapak packaging company 
to donate 24 million to the project for hightech assistance 
computers to register the findings daily and video equipment to 
document the objects

you may know that raw pork is not safe or that a bulging can 
spells trouble but how aware are you of the safety of other items 
in your kitchen take this quiz to find out 
is it safe or risky to eat 
1 hot dogs that have been stored in an unopened package in the 
refrigerator for 10 days 
2 a bruised or moldy piece of fruit 
3 frozen ham that was thawed on the counter 
4 an unopened jar of mayonnaise that has been in the 
refrigerator for six months 
5 a baked potato left out on the counter from the night before 
6 meat loaf thats pink in the middle after cooking 
7 raw ground beef that turns brown after a day or two of 
refrigeration 
8 an uncooked potato with a greenish cast 
9 lettuce or other produce moistened by poultry drippings in a 
grocery bag 
10 steak that was thawed in the refrigerator and then refrozen 
11 cooked shrimp that was never deveined 
12 mustard or ketchup with a black crusty ring around the rim 
of the jar 
13 moldy or shriveled peanuts 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
answers 
1 safe hot dogs that come in vacuumsealed packages can be 
kept in the refrigerator for up to two weeks once opened you can 
keep them for about seven days carefully wrapped in plastic 
2 safe if its just bruised but possibly risky if the bruised 
portion has become moldy some molds can produce harmful toxins 
and its not yet clear whether fruit molds are among them the best 
bet is to cut away the moldy section which should also remove any 
toxins that might be pesent 
3 risky many people think they can take chances with ham 
because it has been smoked or salted but these processes dont 
make the meat immune to bacterial contamination especially since a 
number of manufacturers are lowering the salt content of cured 
meats as with any meat the safest way to thaw ham is in the 
refrigerator 
4 safe its a misconception that foods prepared with 
mayonnaise may go bad sooner in fact its high acid and salt 
content may actually inhibit bacterial growth somewhat you can 
keep an opened jar of mayonnaise in the refrigerator for up to a 
year provided you dont let it sit at room temperature for 
extended periods 
5 risky we usually dont think of potatoes as a likely source 
of food poisoning but there have been reports of deadly botulism 
in people who ate foilwrapped baked potatoes left at room 
temperature for a day or more even when they were reheated 
leftovers of most foods should be promptly refrigerated 
6 risky ground meat undergoes a great deal of handling 
compared to other forms this increases the likelihood of bacterial 
contamination for this reason the usda suggests cooking meat loaf 
until it is brown or at least brownishpink in the center an even 
better guide is to cook it to an internal temperature of 170 
degrees fahrenheit cheching with a thermometer particularly if 
the meat loaf contains pork 
7 safe whether its brown or pink has to do with the amount of 
oxygen with which it has come into contact as a general rule 
however dont keep raw ground beef in the refrigerator longer than 
two days and dont use it under any circumstances if it doesnt 
smell right or was left unrefrigerated for any length of time 
8 risky greenskinned potatoes contain a chemical called 
solanine which can cause gastrointestinal illness you can use 
green potatoes if you peel them well and remove a layer of flesh 
underneath the skin 
9 risky uncooked poultry juices may contain harmful bacteria 
that could lead to trouble when they get into foods that are eaten 
raw if the produce is really saturated youd better not use it 
but if contact was minimal you can remove outer sections or rinse 
and peel 
10 safe especially if some ice crystals remain make sure to 
thaw the frozen meat in the refrigerator the second time around be 
aware too that refreezing might cause flavor and texture 
deterioration you might get better flavor and texture if you cook 
the meat the first time it is thawed then refreeze it 
11 safe you can eat shrimp that hasnt been deveined as long 
as you cook it the black line running down the back is actually 
the intestines of the shrimp which are more susceptible to 
contamination 
12 safe the ring is the result of an interaction of the 
contents with air not a sign of spoilage simply wipe it off and 
use the remaining contents 
13 risky when you crack open peanut shells only to find sickly 
looking nuts dont eat them the types of mold that grow on nuts 
as well as on grains can produce aflatoxins some of which are 
very potent carcinogens

swallowing a bay leaf can mean a trip to the 
emergency room warn doctors who suggest that packages of the herb 
carry warning labels 
only one of five bay leaf victims they studied clearly knew what 
had caused the distress in their throats so the problem is 
probably often overlooked the doctors said 
bay leaves most often dried are used during cooking to enhance 
flavor but usually are removed before the food is served and are 
not eaten 
the five cases occurred over two years suggesting the problem 
is common said a report from evanston hospital in illinois in a 
recent issue of the annals of internal medicine 
four patients complained they felt that something was caught in 
their throats after eating chowder chicken soup chicken or lamb 
stew the fifth had sudden throat pain while drinking onion soup 
a stuck leaf can be retrieved or pushed into the stomach 
depending on the circumstances the doctors said in a case 
reported in 1983 general anesthesia was required to fix the 
problem the doctors said 
prevention could begin with packaging labels that warn of the 
hazards of bay leaf ingestion they wrote cooks could use mesh 
bags to contain the leaves removing the bag of leaves when cooking 
was completed

more than 300 people have written to 
the federal government protesting a plan to snare endangered 
florida panthers and put them in zoos for a captive breeding 
program 
wildlife officials say that may be the only way to save the 
panther an endangered species with only 30 to 50 animals remaining 
please do not breed them in captivity what kind of society 
are we that we would take our state panther and put them on 
display in zoos in captivity greg ray of gainesville wrote in 
a letter to the us fish and wildlife service 
many of the 331 letters were mistaken about various aspects of 
the program in which up to half the remaining panthers would be 
captured although the cats might be turned over to zoos they 
wouldnt necessarily be on display 
fewer than a dozen letters were in favor of the project 
the program is designed to increase the number of panthers to a 
point that a second population could be established in the wild 
probably in northern florida officials said 
many of the letters contained emotional pleas to save the tawny 
cat floridas state animal eleven letters came from a thirdgrade 
class in bronson 
how would you like to live in a cage all your life i would be 
sad if someone came and took me out of my home and put me in a 
cage wrote student shawn voorhees 
dennis jordan florida panther coordinator for the us fish and 
wildlife agency said only scientific data not emotion will save 
the florida panther

the hot market for natural 
sponges is jeopardizing this offshore park because some harvesters 
are hooking the sponges at an alarming rate park administrators 
say 
these sponges in addition to filtering waters provide 
habitats for the juveniles of various species when you just clear 
an area of them its like clearcutting a forest said bob 
kelley a board member of the tropical audubon society theres 
nothing left to live in for the small species 
the harvesters who produced reported sales of 16600 pounds 
last year say an attempt to regulate them could put an end to a 
tradition they brought with them from cuba 
the majority of us have sons we bring them with us to fish 
and they learn said victorino sanchez its a tranquil and 
healthy way to make a living 
harvesters now need only a general state license to sponge fish 
at the park in biscayne bay south of miami and the only water in 
dade county clean enough to sustain large sponge beds 
park administrators want the regulatory plan to reduce harvests 
to 4000 pounds a year as soon as possible and to gradually phase 
out the trade 
what we are proposing is that we have a break in the 
generations that the families living off of it now be permitted to 
continue but they wouldnt be allowed to pass permits on to their 
relatives said park superintendent james sanders 
wholesale prices soared from as low as 4 a dozen to as high as 
45 a dozen sanders said the number of boats went from about four 
to 20 and harvesters from a handful to 80 or more in the last two 
years

much on earnings and not enough on engineering 
stempel and the six men he tapped to lead gm into the 1990s met 
with reporters wednesday morning and outlined changes in the 
corporations top management in essence stempel said 
responsibility lines were straightened between the companys eight 
car and truckmaking operations and gms top brass 
these are not major changes but theyre indicative of where 
were going he said were not taking general motors apart and 
putting it back together again 
stempels ascension to the chairmanship was widely hailed by 
industry observers who said the no 1 automakers product 
development programs had been unnecessarily put on a back burner as 
the company concentrated on boosting profits 
while smith was chairman gms balance sheet moved from a 3334 
million profit in 1981 to a 42 billion profit last year but the 
companys share of the us car and truck market dropped from 46 
percent to 35 percent during that same time 
stempel said the company planned to boost its market share but 
only if it can do it profitably 
the 90s will be a time of adapting and building what we have 
in place stempel said gm shuts down its lakewood assembly plant 
in atlanta on monday putting about 2000 employees out of work 
the company says no further plant closings are in the works other 
than those already announced 
lloyd reuss who became the companys new president wednesday 
said he expects 100 percent of gms assembly plants to be operating 
by 1992 he declined to say what percentage of gms plant capacity 
is being used now 
since 1987 when the company signed its last contract with the 
united auto workers union gm has shut down four assembly plants 
including the lakewood factory and plans to close part of its huge 
lordstown ohio complex when it consolidates fullsize van 
production in flint by 1992 
gm has said the four plants are indefinitely idled with no 
new products scheduled for them reuss said those plants were not 
included in his forecast of 100 percent plant utilization in two 
years and those factories would remain closed 
the uaw has contended that gm has no intention of putting any 
new manufacturing in the plants and reuss comments wednesday 
seems to support that 
like stempel reuss and vice chairman robert j schultz came up 
through gms engineering ranks members of stempels team with 
financial backgrounds are vice chairman john f smith jr 
executive vice president william hoglund and executive vice 
president and chief financial officer robert t oconnell 
stempels move to chairman comes at a time when gms financial 
matters appear to be in good shape some wall street analysts have 
suggested that investors switch from ford motor co and chrysler 
corp stock to gm because gm is the only one of the big three that 
could boost dividends in the near future 
last week gm reported it earned 16 billion the first half of 
this year 465 percent less than in the first six months of 1989 
however gms profits were higher than the 14 billion reported by 
ford and the 251 million reported by struggling chrysler 
stempel 57 joined the company in 1958 as a senior detailer in 
the oldsmobile divisions chassis design department in succeeding 
years he concentrated on powertrain design 
in 1972 stempel was named assistant chief engineer at 
oldsmobile six years later he joined the legion of nearly four 
dozen vice presidents and became general manager of the pontiac 
division 
stempel went to europe in 1980 to head the companys profitable 
adam opel ag carmaking operations in west germany two years later 
he returned to the united states to head gms chevrolet division 
the companys largest carmaking operation 
in february 1986 he joined the gm board as executive vice 
president for the truck amp bus and overseas groups before becoming 
its 17th president 
on wednesday his first day as gms 11th chairman stempel said 
i felt terrific getting up this morning

americans have had their fill of crises real or 
imagined and can hardly tolerate another it probably explains why 
the energy problem has fallen into the background 
but there is uncomfortable news in the background and it might 
be summarized in three sentences american production of crude oil 
is falling consumption is rising imports account for half of us 
supplies 
these ingredients mean an inevitable crisis the only unknown 
being its timing and extent the timing could be sometime in the 
next century it also could be as imminent as the next time warfare 
threatens in the middle east 
the us economy runs on energy that is the nations 
factories homes and means of transportation depend on it as 
history has demonstrated a shortage can stall an automobile or an 
economy with equal effectiveness 
recognizing this america went on an energysaving crusade 
beginning in the 1970s old homes and factories were insulated and 
standards for new ones were raised alternative energy supplies 
were encouraged and businesses for that purpose were founded 
much of that seems like a memory now akin to the lingering 
thoughts some people have of blackouts and ration cards during 
world war ii that deprivation ended suddenly people resumed their 
lives and said never again 
but the energy war never was won its ingredients remain and 
theyre just as explosive as ever a country totally dependent on a 
stable supply but with no assurance of it a country increasing 
energy usage but not its production 
domestic crude oil production in june fell to 71 million 
barrels a day the lowest on record that months output was 77 
percent below a year earlier and no less than 2 million barrels a 
day below the rate in february 1986 
drilling crews have disbanded and while exploration continues 
it is at a reduced rate increasingly the demand for oil runs 
headlong into the demands of environmentalists to protect the 
planets water wildlife and beauty 
the alternative is to import oil imports now are at a record 
high slightly exceeding the record of december 1977 when 479 
percent of the nations supply came from abroad while domestic 
output runs into environmental restrictions imported oil runs in 
opposition to balance of payment efforts 
no matter how it is viewed therefore energy in the form of 
crude and refined oil is a problem of deadly proportions potential 
or actual and it can erupt as easily as for example hostilities 
in the mideast 
in spite of this vulnerability of just about every individual 
business and governmental unit you dont hear much talk these 
days about energy supplies except perhaps to hear about another 
nuclear power facility unbuilt 
all the creative ideas of a decade ago are warehoused like old 
inventory many of the briefly successful alternative energy 
companies have collapsed the old conservation methods seem like 
holdovers from another time 
except for another oil spill energy doesnt make big news these 
days it has receded into the background overwhelmed by what are 
considered to be more urgent problems 
but the ingredients of crisis still are there everyone knows 
it and they know too that experience teaches that knowing is not 
enough

the government has been ordered to prove in 
court why it shouldnt have to compensate tens of thousands of 
workers made sick inhaling asbestos fibers in us navy shipyards 
attorneys said the 21 ruling by the us circuit court of 
appeals for the federal circuit in washington could subject the 
government to millions of dollars in liability for asbestosrelated 
exposure dating to the 1930s 
the government specified products with asbestos in it the 
government controlled working conditions and the government in the 
view of many people has the primary responsibility for what 
happened andrew berry a newark nj attorney for several 
asbestos makers said wednesday 
companies that made asbestos are trying to force the government 
to reimburse them for at least a portion of liability payments 
already exceeding 1 billion the government to date has not 
admitted responsibility or agreed to pay compensation 
the court ruling allows eaglepicher inc keene corp and unr 
industries inc to pursue reimbursement from the government for 
payments made to asbestos victims who worked for the navy 
so far only our clients have paid the tab said joe g 
hollingsworth a washington attorney representing unr and 
eaglepicher the government has escaped liability by virtue of 
technical arguments wed like to prove what its real 
responsibility was 
david s fishback a justice department lawyer handling the 
case declined to comment 
more than 100000 asbestos cases involving workers afflicted 
with lung cancer and other severe and often fatal diseases are 
clogging federal and state court dockets nationwide 
the bulk of the payouts has been made by a trust created in 
manville corp bankruptcy proceedings the trust has run out of 
money and is being restructured to speed payments to needy victims 
other companies also have been pushed into bankruptcy by asbestos 
lawsuits and want to reduce their liability 
widespread illnesses from inhaling fibers of asbestos a 
mineral used widely for its heat resistance and fire retardant 
qualities did not appear until the 1970s in some cases after 
decades of exposure 
manufacturers have argued the government should be held liable 
because it allegedly failed to tell them about asbestos health 
hazards and because the government was contractually responsibile 
for maintaining a safe workplace 
but in numerous decisions in the last 10 years courts have 
shielded the government from liability on the grounds that it has 
immunity against lawsuits filed by federal employees other 
procedural arguments have helped keep cases from proceeding to 
trial 
berry said the latest ruling places pressure on the government 
to assist in resolving the cases 
the decision orders the us claims court to hear anew the three 
companies claims it would be the first time that the merits of 
whether the government is liable rather than jurisdictional 
issues are argued in court 
the us claims court in washington handles all claims against 
the federal government 
the companies had been blocked from pursuing lawsuits against 
the government simultaneously in claims court and federal district 
court but the appellate ruling said the claims court case 
involving the governments contractual obligations with the 
companies should be heard again because it had been dismissed by 
other courts 
a group of defendants in more than 500 asbestos lawsuits in us 
district court in brooklyn on tuesday filed a motion seeking to add 
the government to the list of defendants in the consolidated case 
the government has been held liable in only one case and was 
required to pay onethird of an asbestos settlement of about 
50000 to a maine woman who contracted a lung disease from 
cleaning her fathers asbestostainted clothes 
the governments claim of immunity did not apply in the 1st us 
circuit court of appeals case because the woman was not a federal 
employee 
hollingsworth who represented the maine woman joan dube said 
the government has not paid its portion of the settlement in that 
case or agreed to hold settlement negotiations in a similar case

karsten mahlmann who resigned as chairman of the 
chicago board of trade and head of stotler group inc said he 
hasnt been involved in daytoday affairs at the struggling 
brokerage for two years 
mahlmann who was in an unprecedented fourth term as the cbots 
chief said he was stepping down wednesday in the overwhelming 
interest of the board of trade and because of my deep love and 
respect for the institution according to a statement from the 
exchanges board of directors 
the board said it regretfully accepted the resignation 
effective immediately the board also said it had elected cbot vice 
chairman william f oconnor to serve the remainder of mahlmanns 
oneyear term ending dec 31 
hours earlier he resigned from stotler group inc whose main 
subsidairy has fallen from one of the biggest players on the cbot 
to the target of a commodities futures trading commission civil 
complaint the subsidiary stotler and co has withdrawn from the 
futures business because of shaky finances 
i have had no daytoday management responsibilities at 
stotler since early 1988 and my position at stotler was 
constantly eroded mahlmann said wednesday 
i simply was not a party to the financial decisions at 
stotler which are now being scrutinized by the exchange and the 
regulators he added 
mahlmann said had he been aware of stotlers recent financial 
decisions i would not have condoned them and i would have taken 
action to reverse them 
he said he remains stotler groups largest shareholder 
on tuesday federal regulators filed a civil complaint in us 
district court accusing a stotler subsidiary stotler funds inc 
of violating the commodity exchange act 
the complaint filed by the commodity futures trading commission 
says the commodity pool operator improperly used pools of clients 
money which had been set up for investing in commodity futures 
contracts 
some cbot members believe stotlers woes damaged mahlmanns 
ability to lead the cbots battle over regulation of the futures 
industry and had called for him to resign said john frazier 
director of the agricultural division at chicagobased gerald inc 
an exchange member 
the exchange wants the cftc to maintain control over stockindex 
futures but the bush administration wants to transfer that 
authority to the securities and exchange commission which oversees 
the stock market 
several ranking industry officials though said they didnt see 
mahlmanns departure as having much effect on that fight 
meanwhile both the cftc and the sec have been called to account 
for their handling of the stotler situation 
the house committee on energy and commerce has ordered the 
chairmen of both commissions to submit reports on stotler by aug 
24 
these events raise serious questions about the adequacy of 
regulation and oversight in the futures industry said a letter 
tuesday from committee chairman rep john d dingle dmich and 
rep edward j markey dmass chairman of the subcommittee on 
telecommunications and finance 
press reports suggest that stotler was thinly capitalized as 
early as 1987 but that the commodities futures trading commission 
and the chicago board of trade took no action the letter added

karsten mahlmanns resignation as chairman of the 
chicago board of trade is only the latest woe to befall the 
commodities industry in recent years 
since the 1987 stock market crash questions have been raised on 
whether the commodities futures trading commission is adequately 
regulating the industry and on the honesty of traders on the board 
of trade and the chicago mercantile exchange also given a serious 
look was the way the board of trade handled an alleged attempt to 
corner the soybean market by ferruzi trading international spa 
mahlmann resigned wednesday as chairman of the cbot the worlds 
largest commodity futures exchange amid allegations of wrongdoing 
at a trading company he headed he was midway through an 
unprecedented fourth term as the cbots chief 
mahlmanns resignation came hours after he announced his 
resignation as head of stotler group inc a beleaguered 
commodities company that operates a subsidiary accused of violating 
the commodity exchange act 
on tuesday the commodity futures trading commission filed a 
federal complaint accusing a stotler subsidiary of violating the 
commodity exchange act the complaint names stotler funds inc a 
commodity pool operator owned by stotler group 
the cftc contends stotler funds improperly used pools of 
clients money which had been set up for investing in commodity 
futures contracts to invest in stotler group stotler funds also 
lent 1 million from another pool to its parent company 
much more publicized problems in the futures industry culminated 
last month with the trial of three swiss franc futures traders but 
a federal jury ended up convicting two of the traders of only 
relatively minor trading violations and acquitting the third 
defendant of some offenses 
the jury couldnt reach verdicts on scores of other charges 
including a racketeering count against one defendant and mail and 
wirefraud charges against all three 
officials of the chicago mercantile exchange where the traders 
worked said the jurys action somewhat redeemed the markets 
reputation 
the twomonth trial was the first to result from an undercover 
fbi investigation of corruption at the merc and the board of trade 
in all 48 people have been indicted since august sixteen have 
pleaded guilty to reduced charges 
two other groups 13 soybean traders from the board of trade 
and 15 yen traders from the merc face trials in september 
the heavy scrutiny of commodities industry followed the oneday 
drop of more than 500 points in the dow jones industrial average 
a key market indicator in october 1987 and a 190point singleday 
drop last year 
a cftc study after the second drop indicated index arbitrage was 
not a major factor in the stock slide index arbitrage is a 
computerized program trading strategy that seeks to profit from 
differences between the stock and futures markets the study found 
no evidence of stock index futures market manipulation 
the security and exchange commission and other critics of index 
arbitrage contend it causes wild price swings index arbitragers 
try to take advantage of small price differences between the stock 
and futures markets by simultaneously buying large orders in one 
market while selling in another 
most stock index futures are traded on the chicago mercantile 
exchange 
to curb volatility the bush administration wants to move 
authority for stockindex futures from the cftc to the sec 
the cftc and the futures industry oppose any shift saying it 
will cripple the agencys ability to regulate other futures 
porducts and overregualate a segment of an industry that is trying 
to stave off foreign competition 
the board of trade came under heavy criticism from farmers and 
others last year after it moved to break up an attempt to corner 
the soybean market the cbot issued an emergency order requiring 
the liquidation of large positions in the july soybean futures 
contract 
the order targeted ferruzzi an italian agricultural and 
financial firm and one of the worlds largest soybean processors 
the order prompted soybean prices to tumble sharply with 
agricultural groups saying the action led to lower prices paid to 
producers 
cbot board members also were accused of conflict of interest in 
ordering the liquidations 
the cftc said reasonable grounds existed for the liquidation 
order and said it found no evidence of selfdealing by cbot 
officials who might have sold off their holdings after voting to 
issue the order

usx corp chairman charles a corry said the 
steel and energy giant wont take its cue from other major steel 
makers in upcoming contract talks with the united steelworkers of 
america 
our employees and our company need a contract that will ensure 
that they are part of a competitive enterprise that can make it and 
that will provide them some job security he said wednesday at a 
news conference 
forget the concept of a pattern he said when asked about 
the similarity of contracts agreed to last year by other major 
steel companies 
the chairman previously said those contracts which restored 
labor concessions made during the recession years of the 1980s 
were too generous 
corry said negotiations with the union should begin around dec 
1 the current fouryear pact approved in january 1987 after a 
sixmonth work stoppage expires jan 31 it covers about 18500 
employees 
he said many of usxs competitors have lower labor costs he 
cited nonunion mini mills union mills with lower labor costs and 
financially ailing steel makers that have lower costs while 
reorganizing in us bankruptcy court 
our employees have to look at our situation and come up with 
something that this company can afford he said 
corry said he expects the price of steel oil and natural gas to 
climb in the next five months boosting profits following a 15 
percent drop in secondquarter earnings 
i think the outlook for the second half looks pretty good 
he said during the first half we lived through one hell of a lot 
of volatility in the prices of our primary products 
corry attributed his optimism to the onset of colder weather an 
expected increase in demand for steel and recent efforts by opec 
oil ministers to raise the price of crude 
usx said on tuesday that its secondquarter profit slid to 212 
million from 250 million in 1989 as oil gains failed to offset 
reduced steel profits and losses from the sale of the companys 
natural gas business 
usxs steel segment earnings dropped 53 percent in the second 
quarter largely due to price erosion that begin in the second half 
of 1989 and only recently began to reverse 
corry said there is no conscious plan to shrink the 
companys steel division which he said fared well in the quarter 
compared to other large steel makers 
its making quite a contribution in not a robust 
environment in the industry were able to hold our own he said 
the future of steel was a central issue may 7 when shareholders 
rejected takeover strategist carl icahns proposal to spin off at 
least 80 percent of the companys steel division and return 
proceeds to shareholders 
corry said he has not talked to icahn the companys largest 
shareholder since the vote 
im not aware of any activities or change in thinking hes had 
with respect to his usx stock corry said 
icahn said following his proposals defeat he had no intention 
of selling his stock and would not fade into the background 
on another matter corry said he wrote a letter july 27 to 
president bush outlining his opposition to initiatives to increase 
taxes on energy in an effort to lower the federal budget deficit 
this is a very serious thing for this company because were in 
a unique position of being a big producer of energy products and we 
are at the same time through steel operations a major consumer of 
energy he said 
he said an increase in energy taxes would hinder the 
competitiveness and profitability of american manufacturers and 
energy producers 
meanwhile thomas graham president of the steel division said 
the company will begin work sept 7 on a continuous slab caster 
that will modernize the edgar thompson works south of pittsburgh in 
braddock 
he said the 200 million project will take about two years to 
complete

stock prices tumbled in financial centers of the major 
industrialized countries following the overnight news that iraqi 
forces had invaded and taken control of neighboring kuwait on the 
persian gulf 
world oil prices surged upward on the news propelled by visions 
of possible disruptions in the supply of oil from the middle east 
that in turn raised fears of increased inflationary pressures in 
the united states and other oilconsuming economies 
in addition analysts said investors were fearful that any oil 
shock could hit the american economy at a vulnerable time given 
its recent weak pace of growth 
one of the few pockets of strength among us stocks was the 
energy group texaco jumped 3 to 67 chevron 2 to 81 and

consumers may have to pay more to gas up their 
cars and heat their homes by the end of the year if oil shipments 
are disrupted because of iraqs invasion of neighboring kuwait oil 
experts said today 
prices already have shot up on the wholesale level 
the september contract for west texas intermediate the 
benchmark grade of us crude soared 206 to 2370 a 42gallon 
barrel in early trading on the new york mercantile exchange 
among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange 
unleaded gasoline for september delivery jumped 523 cents to 6950 
cents a gallon heating oil was up 431 cents to 6550 cents a 
gallon 
the costs will have to be passed down to consumers said 
brian tagler an oil trader with shearson lehman hutton inc 
but its hard to predict how much more consumers will have to 
pay experts say 
you may not see the impact on the consumer level for at least 
four to eight weeks said edward ryan an oil trader with dean 
witter reynolds inc the current supplies on hand are adequate 
and i just dont see retail prices reacting in the same way as on 
the wholesale level 
oil producers already are facing a world glut of crude partly 
due to high production by the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries 
in the united states supplies of unleaded gasoline are up about 
10 percent from a year ago to 1672 million barrels from 15632 
million crude stocks are up 50 million from 1989 to 3387 million 
barrels from 3306 million 
the general rule of thumb according to industry experts is 
that for every dollar rise in the barrel of crude oil means a rise 
of two cents to a nickel at the pumps 
tagler said if the united states intervenes on kuwaits 
behalf that also could bring prices back down 
us assistance he said could alleviate any possible 
disruptions in oil production and shipments in the area where the 
united states gets a significant portion of its oil supplies 
iraq and kuwait produce onefifth of the total oil produced by 
opec but their oil accounts for only an estimated 5 percent of 
daily us consumption 
iraqs powerful army was reported to have invaded kuwait early 
today seizing the rulers palace and government buildings 
the assault followed three weeks of tension between kuwait and 
iraq caused by iraqi accusations that kuwait stole oil from its 
territory 
the revolutionary command council led by iraqi president saddam 
hussein claimed it invaded kuwait at the request of revolutionaries 
who had already overthrown the government kuwait and un 
diplomats labeled the coup reports a farce

orders to factories for manufactured goods 
fell 15 percent in june continuing their rollercoaster ride 
through the first half of 1990 the government reported today 
the commerce department said orders for both durable and 
nondurable goods totaled a seasonally adjusted 2374 billion 
after a 22 percent gain in may 
the choppy performance began in january with a 55 percent 
decline the sharpest drop since a 70 percent decrease in 
december 1974 orders also fell 21 percent in april and rose 40 
percent in march and 18 percent in february 
factory orders are a key economic barometer of manufacturing 
industry plans for production a decrease in orders may forecast a 
slump in that sector and layoffs in the future 
the june decline was led by a 28 percent drop in orders for 
durable goods items expected to last more than three years to 
1251 billion but the decline was not as sharp as the 32 percent 
drop when durable goods orders were first reported last week 
nondurable goods orders were unchanged at 1123 billion 
over half of the durables decline was in defense goods which 
dropped 203 percent to 80 billion excluding defense orders 
would have dropped 07 percent 
in the key category of nondefense capital goods a barometer of 
business investment plans orders advanced 06 percent to 361 
billion after falling 18 percent a month earlier 
each of the durable categories posted losses 
transportation orders were down 49 percent to 338 billion 
after rising 102 percent in may excluding transportation orders 
were off 10 percent 
other durable declines included electrical machinery down 37 
percent to 200 billion following a 14 percent gain the previous 
month primary metals down 30 percent to 115 billion after a 
25 percent advance in may and nonelectrical machinery off 25 
percent to 217 billion after increasing 36 percent 
shipments of factory goods in june increased 05 percent to 
2401 billion on top of a 20 percent gain in may but the june 
increase in shipments resulted in a 05 percent drop in unfilled 
orders to 5177 billion 
inventories fell 05 percent to 3705 billion the third 
decrease this year altlhough they were unchanged in may

leaner us defense budgets will eliminate 4000 jobs by 1993 
mostly in connecticut and florida the company announced today 
the company plans to eliminate about 2000 jobs from its 
connecticut maine and georgia operations which have a combined 
staff of about 28300 said curtis linke pratt amp whitneys vice 
president of communications most of the jobs are in connecticut 
which has a total work force of about 25400 
the remaining 2000 jobs will cut from pratt amp whitneys florida 
work force which now stands at 8400 
the reductions will be accomplished primarily through attrition 
but the jetengine maker has not ruled out the possibility of some 
layoffs linke said pratt amp whitney has a worldwide work force of 
about 45000 
the cutbacks would be the second big work force reduction in two 
years the company eliminated 2650 salaried jobs in 1988 and 1989

iraq has nearly doubled its share of world oil 
supplies by taking control of kuwait raising new risks for the 
united states and other nations heavily dependent on imported oil 
private energy experts said today 
that assessment came as president bushs chief economic adviser 
said the us economy should be able to withstand an increase in 
oil prices without being pushed into a recession 
michael boskin chairman of the presidents council of economic 
advisers said even if the turmoil in the mideast resulted in a 25 
percent rise in oil prices it would likely have only a modest 
adverse impact on us economic growth 
fully onehalf of us oil supplies are imported although the 
combined shares of the american market for iraq and kuwait are less 
than 10 percent according to industry figures 
in june the latest month for which figures are available 
persian gulf oil represented 247 percent of total us oil 
imports according to the american petroleum institute the trade 
group for major oil companies a year earlier the figure was 222 
percent 
the united states imported about 24 billion in oil and other 
goods last year from iraq while us exports to iraq led by 
agricultural commodities totaled 117 billion in 1989 
iraq is one of the united states biggest trading partners in 
the arab world surpassed only by saudi arabia iraqs leading 
exports to the united states are crude oil and dates 
kuwaits exports to the united states also mainly oil totaled 
973 million last year kuwait imported 855 million in us goods 
led by motor vehicles and parts 
christopher flavin a vice president of the worldwatch 
institute said iraqs invasion of tiny kuwait may have little 
immediate effect on world oil supplies if the conflict does not 
escalate and kuwaiti oil workers cooperate with iraq 
a more troubling question flavin said is what step iraqi 
president saddam hussein might take toward seeking control of oil 
fields elsewhere on the arabian peninsula 
by grabbing kuwait saddam has boosted his share of world oil 
reserves to 20 percent iraq has about 100 billion barrels of 
reserves while kuwait has about 94 billion according to figures 
published this summer by british petroleum 
if iraq gained control of saudi arabia which ranks as the 
worlds largest oil exporter and the no 1 supplier to the united 
states it could garner enough economic clout to hold the world 
economy at risk flavin said 
saudi arabia with reported oil reserves of 255 billion barrels 
is the most oilrich nation in the world 
flavin estimated that an iraqi military move against saudi 
arabia and the smaller united arab emirates could give saddam 
control of 60 percent of total world oil reserves 
boskin told the congressional joint economic committee that the 
gross national product would be trimmed by a few tenths of a 
percentage point by a 25 percent rise in oil prices 
even if the higher price is enforced our economy today is 
much better able to absorb modest price increases boskin said 
but he conceded that a rise in world oil prices would have 
some deleterious impact on our economy the impact he said 
would be more harmful on the japanese economy because of its 
greater dependence on imports from opec 
boskins scheduled appearance before congress was to explain the 
administrations downward economic forecasts for 1990 and 1991 and 
the impact those revisions have had on the budget deficit

americans have had their fill of crises real or 
imagined and can hardly tolerate another it probably explains why 
the energy problem has fallen into the background 
but there is uncomfortable news in the background and it might 
be summarized in three sentences american production of crude oil 
is falling consumption is rising imports account for half of us 
supplies 
these ingredients mean an inevitable crisis the only unknown 
being its timing and extent the timing could be sometime in the 
next century it also could be as imminent as the next time warfare 
threatens in the middle east 
the us economy runs on energy that is the nations 
factories homes and means of transportation depend on it as 
history has demonstrated a shortage can stall an automobile or an 
economy with equal effectiveness 
recognizing this america went on an energysaving crusade 
beginning in the 1970s old homes and factories were insulated and 
standards for new ones were raised alternative energy supplies 
were encouraged and businesses for that purpose were founded 
much of that seems like a memory now akin to the lingering 
thoughts some people have of blackouts and ration cards during 
world public emotion hostility and 
compassion frustration and sympathy has escalated as the ranks 
of the homeless swell 
people are frustrated its not over were into quick fixes 
said mary ann gleason director of the denver healthcare for the 
homeless clinic which serves about 6500 people a year there 
are hundreds of thousands of people weve gotten off the streets 
but there are more falling in behind them 
no one knows how many americans are homeless estimates range 
from 300000 to 3 million but no one disputes the fact that the 
number is increasing and greater numbers mean greater visibility 
its a common perception that at least among some parts of 
society theres not only less compassion but more organized 
hostility toward the homeless said gary blasi president of the 
national coaltion for the homeless and a legal aid foundation 
attorney in los angeles a city with a homeless population 
estimated at more than 150000 
a large part of the source of the hostility is that its not 
great to have a lot of homeless people around when youre a tourist 
city blasi said its not just the cable cars and the golden 
gate anymore 
what passes for heartlessness often is case of empty municipal 
pockets with compassionate programs succumbing to financial 
pressures the city council in washington faced with a 95 million 
budget deficit voted in june to gut its policy of guaranteeing 
overnight shelter to anyone who requested it that ordinance was 
championed by the late homeless activist mitch snyder and passed 
six years ago by more than 70 percent of the vote 
in philadelphia 80 members of the mayors publicprivate task 
force on homelessness resigned in july to protest massive cuts in 
the citys budget for homeless services after the amount dropped 
from 34 million to 10 million in two years at the same time the 
city plans to spend 1 million closing off spaces under train 
platforms in a downtown station where people like to sleep 
i see no abatement whatsoever in peoples concern people 
calling people coming in people of all ages making an effort and 
reaching out said phyllis ryan director of the philadelphia 
committee for the homeless and one of the former task force 
members the government resources have just not been sufficient 
i think they just looked out there and decided whos a voter and 
who isnt 
in some places voters aggravated by the homeless problem are 
using their electoral clout to protest residents in santa monica 
calif have collected thousands of signatures to place a 
proposition on the november ballot to make the city attorneys 
office an elected one the current city attorney robert myers has 
refused to prosecute people for sleeping outdoors 
i think theres an increasing feeling of helplessness said 
barbara stinchfield santa monicas community development manager 
we get proposals weekly on how to solve the homeless problem 
its frustrating its troubling its unsettling its not getting 
better but most people are not reacting in a really destructive 
way 
citizens in santa cruz calif took their anger to the streets 
when 200 homeless activists rallied outside the santa cruz county 
courthouse demanding an end to the citys camping ban they were 
outnumbered by 600 counterdemonstrators who said they were tired of 
giving bums and squatters a free ride in the seaside town 
about 75 miles south of san francisco 
i think what happened in santa cruz and san francisco has to 
do with something much bigger than homelessness gleason said 
the american public she believes feels angry but helpless over 
things like the hud scandal and the savingsandloan bailout i 
think people are feeling so frustrated from being bamboozled and 
taken advantage of on every front homelessness gets lumped in with 
the rest of it its very easy to take your anger out on the poor 
its more difficult to find effective solutions to the problem 
but citizens in seattle are trying said martha dilts executive 
director of seattle emergency housing service 
seattle residents are trying to raise 1 million for 
transitional housing for homeless families and a local real estate 
companys agents are donating part of their commissions to fight 
homelessness 
i see people starting to realize that homelessness is 
affecting more people that it could happen to your family or your 
neighbor theres a feeling of community and a sense of we can do 
it said dilts a member of the governors homeless task force 
advocates agree that homelessness will persist until society 
deals with the lack of affordable housing access to drug treatment 
and mental health facilities and absence of affordable childcare 
and other support services for the working poor meanwhile cities 
are being forced to expand and improve shelter facilities 
something many communities are loathe to do 
although washington has been under court order to expand its 
shelter system council members say neighborhoods will not accept 
one without a fight in one area a homeless mans arrest on murder 
charges galvanized the neighbors they held bake sales to finance 
their effort to close the shelter in which he lived 
in a suburban westchester county ny community neighbors 
have filed five lawsuits to try to stop construction of a 108unit 
complex for homeless women and children in a san jose calif 
neighborhood residents are fighting a homeless shelter they 
believe is responsible for a 120 percent increase in felonies in 
their area 
if there was a shred of sympathy in me before one resident 
said after seeing this i have lost all compassion 
sometimes however neighbors find the cure far less painful 
than they had anticipated a project to help mentally ill homeless 
women in denver was welcomed into a neighborhood after residents 
fears were allayed by the projects planners the house has been a 
smashing problemfree success 78 percent of those who passed 
through there in the first year now have homes and neighbors now 
drop by to donate lawn chairs and tomato plants 
i dont think the american public knows whats going on in 
homeless services today gleason said part of it is 
misinformation part of it is honesttogod displaced anger when 
people understand both what the homeless reality is and what were 
trying to do about it it paints a whole different picture

midland bank plc hurt by high interest rates and 
smaller margins on thursday posted a slim net profit of 22 million 
pounds or about 405 million in the first half of the year 
midland also announced it was cutting 4000 jobs from its work 
force of 33000 the firm said the cuts should be implemented by 
the end of 1991 mostly through attrition and voluntary departures 
midland said its net profit for the six months ended june 30 
came to 13 pence or about 24 cents per share that compared with 
a net loss of 383 million pounds or about 705 million in the 
1989 period when the bank substantially raised its provisions 
against bad loans to third world countries 
on a pretax basis the company had a profit of 36 million 
pounds or about 66 million compared with a loss of 531 million 
pounds or 977 million in the yearearlier period 
pretax profit before loan provisions and exceptional charges 
fell 19 percent to 363 million pounds or about 668 million from 
440 million pounds 810 million 
midland chairman sir kit mcmahon said the results were 
unacceptable but that refocusing the banks operations toward 
investment banking coupled with reducing assets and propping up 
the banks capital for future growth should help generate some 
added profitability over the next six months 
operating income was little changed at 155 billion pounds 29 
billion operating costs partly due to a move to improve 
technology and expand certain british operations rose 10 percent 
to 12 billion pounds 22 billion 
the bank is not required to report quarterly results all 
figures were converted at the current exchange rate of 184 
american dollars to the pound

stock prices finished sharply lower thursday 
following iraqs invasion of kuwait 
excluding the oil sector stocks were knocked broadly lower as 
the market interpreted the events in the persian gulf to mean that 
higher oil prices would boost british inflation beyond its current 
98 percent level and keep uk interest rates at the very least at 
their present 15 percent levels 
we see the nonoil western economies with the exception of 
the us facing the possibility of now having to tighten interest 
rates to counteract increased inflationary prospects said paul 
harrison a vice president at salomon brothers international in 
london 
wall street also acted as a drag on the london market dealers

the nyses composite index ots at controlling 
production 
iraq assaulted its muchsmaller neighbor less than a week after 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries signed an accord 
designed to restore production discipline to the sometimes unruly 
organization 
it takes that piece of paper puts a light to it and sends it 
up the chimney said peter gignoux director of the international 
energy department at shearson lehman hutton in london 
the invasion also reinforced suspicions that the cartel might be 
increasingly controlled by the whims of iraqi president saddam 
hussein 
husseins military threats against kuwait and the united arab 
emirates were seen as a motivating factor in last weeks agreement 
he had complained that his country lost 14 billion in oil revenue 
in the past year because kuwait and the uae cheated on their opec 
supply quotas and forced down crude prices 
it weakens the organization because one country now dominates 
completely and imposes its will on the others said peter 
bogin associate director for oil markets at cambridge energy 
research associates in paris 
but others said the invasion reflected changes that might signal 
greater discipline 
up until now the cartel lacked an enforcement mechanism 
said nauman barakat in shearsons energy department in new york 
we do now have that mechanism saddam hussein to make sure 
policies are enforced very vigorously 
there was no comment from opec this is a political thing 
said one cartel official demanding anonymity it has nothing to 
do with us 
the agreement signed last friday by all 13 nations boosted 
opecs target price to 21 a barrel from the 18 mark in effect 
since december 1986 iraq had argued for a 25 price 
analysts said the target was likely hit or even surpassed 
when crude prices surged thursday on worries that the iraqi 
invasion could disrupt supplies in the persian gulf the average 
price of a basket of crudes monitored by the cartel was 1750 last 
week 
as part of their accord opec ministers promised to limit total 
output to 225 million barrels a day for the rest of the year 
above the ceiling of 221 million barrels in the first half of 
1990 actual output was put at about 232 million barrels in july 
the arrangement also lifted the uaes production quota by 
400000 barrels to 15 million barrels a day to try to end that 
countrys cheating the uae pumped 2 million barrels daily in 
july according to new estimates from the international energy 
agency 
with iraqs aggression the uae another small gulf state 
will be even more inclined to halt excess production analysts said 
kuwaits supply cap remains at 15 million barrels a day it was 
producing about 100000 barrels over that last month although it 
had gone much higher earlier in the year analysts said 
iraq because of its oil might long has been a powerful opec 
member with iran it holds the second largest production quota at 
31 million barrels a day each 
saudi arabia the worlds largest oil exporter pumps about a 
quarter of the cartels oil with a quota of 54 million barrels

oil and gold prices and the dollar soared today on 
world financial markets after iraqs invasion of iraq but then 
fell back when buyers decided they had overeacted 
oil prices were nearly 2 a barrel higher late in the day after 
rising more than 3 in frenzied trading earlier on concerns the 
invasion would disrupt supplies 
iraq and kuwait are among the worlds biggest oil producers and 
represent more than 20 percent of opecs output 
the dollar jumped most sharply against the japanese yen because 
the american currency is viewed as a haven and japan imports 99 
percent of its oil 
gold also regarded as a safe investment during times of 
turmoil finished in london with a gain of more than 4 a troy 
ounce after having moved as much as 14 higher than wednesdays 
finish earlier in the day 
stock prices fell on inflationary fears but oilrelated shares 
benefited 
there was confusion in the financial markets following todays 
invasion 
there are a lot of wild cards out there said peter gignoux 
manager of the international energy desk at shearson lehman hutton 
inc in london 
ted arnold a metals specialist at merrill lynch pierce fenner 
and smith ltd in london said the market at this stage is very 
very confused no one is certain what is going to happen 
the spot price of north sea brent blend the most widely traded 
international crude oil stood at 2239 a barrel by late thursday 
afternoon up from wednesdays london close of 2040 
the last time oil prices moved up this sharply was during the 
iranian revolution in 1979 gignoux said 
trading on the amsterdamrotterdamantwerp spot oil market was 
disorderly and one rotterdam broker complained of difficulty in 
getting accurate price quotes 
in tokyo the dollar closed at 14890 yen up 225 yen from 
wednesdays close and later in london the dollar was quoted at a 
higher rate of 14960 yen gold was quoted at a late spot bid of 
37875 per ounce in london up from 37430 late wednesday 
a main concern is that higher oil prices will fuel inflation in 
major industrial countries 
londons financial timesstock exchange 100share index dropped 
345 points or 15 percent to close at 23045 
in light of britains decision to freeze all kuwaiti assets the 
london stock exchange late thursday advised members to review all 
its securities transactions entered into on behalf of the 
government or residents of kuwait 
the stock exchange advised member firms not to undertake any 
further business on behalf of such investors and suggested that its 
members explore the possibility of cancelling all such 
transactions entered into today 
peter nicol an analyst with the london investment firm warburg 
securities said he didnt expect any actual disruption of oil 
supplies and that prices could drift back down if there is not 
major escalation of news 
but nicol said the fear of disruption is genuine and people 
are right to be concerned it makes people focus again on the 
security of supplies 
countries that depend on kuwait and iraqi oil could easily 
switch to other suppliers in a global market that at the moment 
is awash in oil 
however north sea production currently is down to 19 million 
barrels a day instead of up to 23 million barrels a day because 
fields are shut down for routine summer maintenance today oil 
workers began a 24hour wildcat strike to protest safety standards 
at the meeting of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries last week iraq pressed for a target price of 25 a 
barrel and for output curbs 
under last weeks pact iraq has a quota of 314 million barrels 
a day and kuwait of 15 million barrels a day under opecs 
production ceiling of 225 million barrels a day for the second 
half of the year the 13member cartels oil target price is 21 a 
barrel 
opec currently is producing about 23 million barrels a day 
nicol said

iraqs invasion of fellow opec member 
kuwait may have dealt a sharp blow to the cartels attempts at 
solidarity in restraining oil output and gradually raising world 
crude prices analysts said thursday 
although oil prices shot higher thursday following news of the 
invasion thursday analysts said the longterm impact of the 
assault possibly could be to weaken opecs attempts at controlling 
production 
iraq assaulted its muchsmaller neighbor less than a week after 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries signed an accord 
designed to restore production discipline to the sometimes unruly 
organization 
it takes that piece of paper puts a light to it and sends it 
up the chimney said peter gignoux director of the international 
energy department at shearson lehman hutton in london 
the invasion also reinforced suspicions that the cartel might be 
increasingly controlled by the whims of iraqi president saddam 
hussein 
saddams military threats against kuwait and the united arab 
emirates were seen as a motivating factor in last weeks agreement 
he had complained that his country lost 14 billion in oil revenue 
in the past year because kuwait and the uae cheated on their opec 
supply quotas and forced down crude prices 
it weakens the organization because one country now dominates 
completely and imposes its will on the others said peter 
bogin associate director for oil markets at cambridge energy 
research associates in paris 
but others said the invasion reflected changes that might signal 
greater discipline 
up until now the cartel lacked an enforcement mechanism 
said nauman barakat in shearsons energy department in new york 
we do now have that mechanism saddam hussein to make sure 
policies are enforced very vigorously 
there was no comment from opec this is a political thing 
said one cartel official demanding anonymity it has nothing to 
do with us 
the agreement signed last friday by all 13 nations boosted 
opecs target price to 21 a barrel from the 18 mark in effect 
since december 1986 iraq had argued for a 25 price 
analysts said the target was likely hit or even surpassed 
when crude prices surged thursday on worries that the iraqi 
invasion could disrupt supplies in the persian gulf the average 
price of a basket of crudes monitored by the cartel was 1750 last 
week 
as part of their accord opec ministers promised to limit total 
output to 225 million barrels a day for the rest of the year 
above the ceiling of 221 million barrels in the first half of 
1990 actual output was put at about 232 million barrels in july 
the arrangement also lifted the uaes production quota by 
400000 barrels to 15 million barrels a day to try to end that 
countrys cheating the uae pumped 2 million barrels daily in 
july according to new estimates from the international energy 
agency 
with iraqs aggression the uae another small gulf state 
will be even more inclined to halt excess production analysts said 
kuwaits supply cap remains at 15 million barrels a day it was 
producing about 100000 barrels over that last month although it 
had gone much higher earlier in the year analysts said 
iraq because of its oil might long has been a powerful opec 
member with iran it holds the second largest production quota at 
31 million barrels a day each 
saudi arabia the worlds largest oil exporter pumps about a 
quarter of the cartels oil with a quota of 54 million barrels

good crop weather in the midwest 
the markets got an early boost from the overwhelmingly bullish 
sentiment that flooded the crude oil and precious metal markets 
following news that iraq invaded kuwait

weather pattern of mild temperatures and occasional showers will 
continue in the midwest said william biedermann research director

the dollar rocketed higher thursday after iraqs 
invasion of kuwait sent currency investors scrambling to a safe 
haven but the buying frenzy faded in later trading and the dollar 
ended the day well off its peaks 
gold gained strongly on world markets 
foreign exchange dealers in asia europe and the united states 
reported business was extremely brisk particularly in the first 
hours after news broke that iraqi troops had moved into neighboring 
kuwait 
it has been a little bit crazy looking back over the last 24 
hours said peter wild treasurer at the swiss bank bank julius 
baer amp co in new york 
the dollar rode a roller coaster it was driven up steeply 
against all its major foreign counterparts in the early going as 
panicky investors poured money into dollars as a way of protecting 
themselves against the instability caused by the persian gulf 
turmoil 
later the us currency fell back to earth when dealers took 
advantage of the surge to sell and collect profits on their dollar 
holdings 
concern about weak us economic growth in light of recent poor 
reports damped enthusiasm for dollars statistics due friday on 
unemployment during july were widely awaited by the financial 
markets 
only the japanese yen failed to regain much of the ground it 
lost to the dollar dealers unloaded yen due to concern that japan 
would be hurt more than any other major industrialized country by 
disruptions in mideast oil supplies japan depends on imports for 
nearly all its oil needs 
by the time trading was done in new york the dollar stood at 
14930 yen up from 14730 yen wednesday but below an earlier high 
of nearly 150 yen in tokyo the dollar closed at 14890 yen up 
225 yen from wednesdays close and in london the dollar was quoted 
at 14960 yen 
the dollars advance was underpinned by news of us economic 
sanctions against iraq and strong condemnations from other major 
industrialized nations against the baghdad governments actions 
british sterling lost some ground against the dollar a pound 
was quoted at 18545 late in new york compared to 18552 late 
wednesday in london the british pound fell to 18495 from 
18550 late wednesday 
selected late dollar rates in new york compared with 
wednesdays late quotes included 15910 german marks up from 
158885 13530 swiss francs down from 13540 53320 french 
francs up from 53240 116450 italian lire up from 116275

union pilots who joined a strike against eastern 
airlines have the right to replace trainees hired during the 
carriers rebuilding a federal judge ruled thursday 
its clearly a major victory said ej breen spokesman for 
the air line pilots association which challenged an eastern claim 
that returning pilots were not needed 
but eastern planned to appeal the decision and officials said 
there will be no immediate effect on current employees or 
operations 
a statement by eastern indicated its appeal is likely to take 
some time 
all but 200 of the 3600 alpa pilots walked off the job in 
sympathy with striking machinists in march 1989 pilots ended their 
strike last november but fewer than 50 have been recalled to the 
miamibased airline alpa officials said 
in a 12page ruling us district court judge edward davis 
agreed with alpas claims that the federal railway labor act 
guarantees returning strikers job rights ahead of the newly hired 
trainees 
the court must balance competing interests the right of 
striking pilots to return to jobs against managements efforts to 
maintain the status quo throughout the strike davis wrote 
this court concludes the balance weighs in favor of reinstating 
in place of trainees 
breen said the exact number of jobs affected by the ruling 
likely will be determined through further hearings but alpa 
contends that at least 404 pilots were in training when pilots 
ended their strike in november and are subject to replacement 
eastern spokewoman karen ceremsak said the airline estimates 180 
jobs are affected by the ruling 
about 1400 former eastern pilots may still be interested in 
returning said alpa spokesman lou baldwin in miami many of the 
pilots were hired by other airlines following the strike that began 
march 4 1989 
eastern filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection five days 
after the strike began and presently operates about 800 flights 
from its prestrike service of 1040 
ms ceremsak said she does not believe davis ruling must 
receive bankruptcy court approval 
davis concluded easterns hiring of pilot trainees violated the 
railway labor act because the company did not bring on workers 
already qualified to fly regular flights the purpose of the act it 
to provide uninterrupted transportation service davis ruled 
contracting with unqualified persons for future employment as 
pilots does not serve to fill the void left by the striking pilots 
as least not until some later date davis wrote 
the ruling stems from an august 1989 court filing by eastern 
seeking a judgment that it need not replace newly hired pilots with 
returning pilots 
baldwin said the eastern pilots trainees annual pay of about 
27000 is significantly higher than the industry average the 
average prestrike pay at eastern for fully accredited pilots was 
about 65000 he said 
if davis ruling is upheld on appeal all returning pilots would 
need to go through several weeks of recertification training under 
the federal aviation administration eastern officials said

gold futures prices ended moderately higher thursday on new 
yorks commodity exchange after paring gains of more than 10 an 
ounce in a move inspired by iraqs conquest of kuwait 
the performance disappointed market bulls but analysts said it 
could be several days before the dust settles and reveals whether 
gold has ended its recent upward trend 
on other commodity markets oil futures soared livestock and 
meat futures were down sharply and grains and soybeans were mixed 
gold futures settled 340 to 350 higher with the contract for 
delivery in august at 37680 a troy ounce silver was 1 cent to 
13 cents higher with august at 4835 a troy ounce 
august gold traded as high as 38650 during the session 
posting its strongest gains just after the opening as traders 
reacted to news of the iraqkuwait conflict demand for gold 
typically rises during times of international hostitility and 
economic uncertainty 
reports that iraqi troops had seized the kuwaiti capital 
prompted frenzied buying of petroleum futures and aggressive 
selling of stocks those events also sent strong buy signals to the 
gold market 
analysts said the conquest of kuwait catapulted iraq to the top 
ranks of world oil powers and posed new economic risks for the 
united states and other countries dependent on imported oil 
but after the early price spike selling gradually eroded most 
of golds gains and even though the market settled at or above a 
level that only a day before had been considered a key test of the 
markets underlying strength analysts said the close was 
disappointing 
its really hard to feel exuberant about the gold market 
considering it finished near the lows of the day said craig 
sloane an analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co in new 
york 
but sloane said the market typically takes a day or two to 
adjust after a major event such as iraqs invasion of kuwait 
i would regard tomorrow as a real good test he said if 
this market wants to trade well well have to do better tomorrow 
petroluem futures also closed below the days highs on the new 
york mercantile exchange but prices still ended dramatically 
higher in reaction to a swiftly imposed us ban on iraqi imports 
in response to the attack 
iraqi oil accounts for about 8 percent of us oil imports 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 72 cents to 157 
higher with september at 2311 a barrel heating oil was 215 
cents to 35 cents higher with september at 6469 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was 3 cents to 38 cents higher with september at 
6807 cents a gallon 
weak cash markets sent pork futures down sharply for the second 
straight day on the chicago mercantile exchange all frozen pork 
belly contracts plunged the permitted daily limit of 2 cents a 
pound nearterm hog futures fell their limit of 15 cents 
cattle futures also fell but closed above the days lows 
live cattle settled 30 cent to 65 cent lower with august at 
7757 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent to 62 cent lower 
with august at 8885 cents a pound live hogs were 65 cent to 15 
cents lower with august at 5855 cents a pound frozen pork bellies 
were 2 cents lower across the board with august at 4722 cents a 
pound 
wheat futures prices rose slightly on the chicago board of trade 
but the corn and soybean markets fell extending wednesdays losses 
amid forecasts for more good crop weather in the midwest 
wheat futures settled unchanged to 3 cents higher with 
september at 283 a bushel corn was unchanged to 3 cents lower 
with september at 252 a bushel oats were 3 cents to 4 cents 
lower with september at 118 a bushel soybeans were 1 cent to 4

oil prices were boosted by the possibility the invasion 
eventually could affect output from the two nations or other 
members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
the september contract for west texas intermediate the 
benchmark grade of us crude rose 157 to 2311 a barrel on the 
new york mercantile exchange later months advanced 1 the limit 
for oneday advances in those contracts

contract reaching 2380 but lost ground after reports circulated 
that iraq might withdraw its troops within 48 hours 
earlier in london the spot price of north sea brent blend the 
most widely traded international crude oil finished at 2239 a 
barrel up nearly 2 from wednesday but down from its highs of the 
day 
its been a rumordriven market said greg dreis a trader 
with merrill lynch energy futures 
traders said they had not seen oil prices shoot up as fast since 
1979 when the iranian revolution also raised concerns about the 
flow of oil from the middle east 
but trading was checked somewhat by the knowledge that other oil 
producers including opecs biggest member saudi arabia could 
increase their output and provide a safety valve against a severe 
drop in oil shipments 
they have the potential to make up for a substantial portion 
if not all of any deficit said william byers an analyst with 
bear stearns amp co 
trading was similar for the dollar which rose in early trading 
before falling back somewhat 
the us currency got a twofold boost the dollar is considered 
a safe haven for investors during world strife and it is the 
medium of exchange for crude oil analysts said traders who have 
shied away from it recently were buying heavily in early trading to 
adjust their holdings 
but the dollar which has been depressed in recent weeks because 
of the weakening us economy gave up some of its gains as foreign 
exchange traders later grew pessimistic about the economic 
ramifications of surging oil prices 
with oil and other energy sources crucial for every segment of 
the economy rising crude prices can reinvigorate inflation that 
would make the federal reserve which considers fighting inflation 
one of its top priorities less likely to move interest rates 
lower 
even if the fed eased credit it would be more tentative 
said raymond stone a managing director of stone amp mccarthy 
research associates inc 
if these oil prices stick it means the country will be that 
much closer to recession stone said 
the dollar closed at 15910 west german marks up from 158885 
late wednesday in new york trading the british pound which has 
stormed higher against the dollar recently slipped to 18545 from 
18552 
the japanese yen fell sharply as japan imports 99 percent of 
its oil and would be hurt by a surge in oil prices the dollar rose 
to 14930 yen from late thursdays 14730

economy

prices would have on corporate profits heavy selling sent stock 
prices broadly lower 
the dow jones industrial average of 30 blue chip stocks dropped 
3466 points to 286460 on the broader market declining issues 
outpaced advancers by a margin of more than 5 to 2 on the new york 
stock exchange 
one sector of stocks that bucked the downward trend was energy 
issues which advanced on the expectation of higher profits for oil 
producers 
stocks also fell in london where the widely followed financial 
timesstock exchange 100stock index dropped 345 points to 23045 
on the tokyo stock exchange the 225issue nikkei stock average 
lost 59281 points or 192 percent to close at 3024518 in 
thursday trading investors were panicked by the effect that oil 
prices would have on business in japan 
bond prices were hit hard by the prospect of higher inflation 
which erodes the valued of fixedincome securities and by the 
possibility that interest rates wont be dropping soon bond prices 
rise when rates decline so higher rates depress prices

kansas gas and electric co urged 
stockholders thursday to reject a 27pershare 875 million 
takeover offer from kansas city power and light co 
kgampe said the offer made last month of 857 million in cash 
for its common stock and 18 million cash for three series of 
preferred stock was inadequate 
kcpl spokesman turner white said the utility still was willing 
to negotiate with kgampe but he said kcpl officials needed to study 
kgampes full response before deciding on their next move 
federal lawsuits have been filed by both utilities and two 
groups of kgampe stockholders in connection with the takeover attempt 
in documents filed with the securities and exchange commission 
in washington kgampe said its board decided last friday that the 
offer was inadequate and not in the best interests of the company 
and its shareholders 
kgampe did not indicate how much the offer fell short of its 
perceived value of the company 
kgampe said it was not involved in merger sale or reorganization 
talks with anyone the company said it does not believe kcpl has 
met conditions needed to require kgampe to provide a list of 
stockholders and call a special shareholders meeting 
the utility said it believes the offer could have adverse tax 
consequences for some shareholders and significant effects on 
employees customers and the communities kgampe serves 
white said kcpl does not plan to lay off any kgampe workers he 
said the utility would freeze customer rates until jan 1 1993 
and has a strong record of commitment to communities in its service 
area 
kgampe has excess generating capacity that kcpl would like to 
utilize to postpone building new generating plants 
kgampe said its strategies for the future include a carefully 
structured longterm plan for revenue enhancement from increased 
sales of power and energy in both wholesale and retail markets 
the filings also said kgampe was instituting further controls on 
capital and operating costs that would improve earnings without 
significantly increasing rates

customers in south central and southeast kansas its 1989 revenue 
was 5335 million and it reported net profits of 475 million

the scandalridden resignation of chicago board 
of trade chairman karsten mahlmann has helped revive a regulatory 
turf war that appeared to be winding down for lack of fuel 
within hours of mahlmanns announcement wednesday us reps 
john d dingell dmich and edward j markey dmass announced 
an investigation into the collapse of his brokerage firm with an 
emphasis on the adequacy of regulation and oversight in the 
futures industry 
on thursday one futures industry leader countered that the 
securities and exchange commission which regulates securities 
trading might be more to blame than the commodity futures trading 
commission which regulates futures trading for any failure to 
protect customers of mahlmanns trading company stotler group inc 
after all said david vogel chairman of the futures industry 
association as a futures brokerage trade group the sec had 
jurisdiction over stotlers offering of shares in two commodity 
investment funds that are at the center of federal allegations that 
stotler defrauded customers 
if anybody wants to start throwing stones its a little 
difficult to figure out who to throw stones at said vogel chief 
executive of the futures brokerage lit america inc 
i dont want to say the secs responsible but i dont think 
the cftcs responsible at all vogel said in a telephone 
interview 
the argument signals another round in the longrunning seccftc 
brawl for jurisdiction over stockindex futures 
the fall of cash mahlmann had nothing to do with stockindex 
futures which are contracts traded on futures exchanges that allow 
investors to speculate on stockmarket movements without ever 
owning stocks 
but mahlmanns problems have much to do with critics 
perceptions that the cftc is a lax regulator with a toocozy 
relationship with the industry it is supposed to be overseeing 
william hegen deputy regional administrator of the chicago sec 
office has said the sec tipped off the cftc to an allegedly 
improper transfer of 134 million in debt from a stotler unit to 
the parent company 
critics of the futures industry are likely to complain that the 
cftc should have been keeping a closer watch on stotler said james 
mcgurk a chicago commodities lawyer who has followed the seccftc 
turf battle 
the foes of the industry are going to use this he said 
the battle rages 
the fight had cooled recently amid waning congressional support 
for a bushadministration bill transferring jurisdiction over 
stockindex futures to the sec 
but stotlers collapse gives the sec and its supporters more 
ammunition mcgurk said 
now theyve got an answer were trying to do it better than 
these guys who couldnt do it thats the argument thats going to 
be advanced he said 
the fraud charges filed tuesday by the cftc were prompted by an 
alleged separate attempt to inject cash into the financially ailing 
stotler court documents allege that stotler funds inc an 
affiliate of stotler that operates commodity investment pools 
improperly transferred more than 5 million in customer funds to 
the parent company 
the funds were supposed to be used only for investment in 
commodity markets 
mahlmann has denied any involvement in stotlers recent 
financial decisions saying he was spending almost all his time 
running the board of trade

freddie mac the secondary mortgage market 
company said wednesday that earnings rose 11 percent in the 
apriljune quarter to a 20year record 
earnings were 118 million or 197 per share compared with 
106 million 177 per share in the same period of 1989 
freddie mac the nickname for the federal home loan mortgage 
corp is a congressionally chartered shareholderowned company 
that purchases mortgages from lenders and packages many of them 
into securities for resale to investors 
its activities account for financing of about one in eight home 
purchases 
robert j quinlan freddie macs senior vice president of 
control attributed the earnings rise to increased fee income and a 
widening in the spread between the interest it earns on its 
mortgages and the interest it pays on its securities 
the earnings increase came despite a rise in freddie macs 
provision for mortgage losses which totaled 87 million in the 
second quarter up from 61 million a year ago 
the companys purchase of mortgages declined 4 percent to 176 
billion in the second quarter compared with 184 billion a year

the nations top futures regulator denied that 
a commodities firm linked to former chicago board of trade chairman 
karsten mahlmann received special treatment in a probe of alleged 
wrongdoing 
commodity futures trading commission chairman wendy gramm told a 
senate panel thursday night that mahlmann who resigned as cbot 
head amid charges of wrongdoing against a company he headed was 
not treated as a fellow insider by industry insiders 
gramm the wife of sen phil gramm rtexas also denied 
allegations that she did polticial work for her husband and was 
paid out of campaign funds which might be a conflict of interest 
if any contributors were regulated by the cftc 
i dont involve myself in my husbands campaign gramm told 
the senate agriculture committee adding that she did not know who 
contributors were 
except for those two issues the onehour hearing seemed more 
like a testimonial dinner as senator after senator among the 
handful of committee members present late thursday praised gramm 
and her agency 
the panel was expected to vote favorably on her renomination and 
send it to the full senate friday or saturday senate aides said 
on wednesday the same day he resigned as chief of the worlds 
largest commodity futures exchange mahlmann also stepped down as 
head of stotler group inc the parent company of a firm accused by 
the cftc of fraud 
but in answer to a question by sen patrick leahy dvt the 
committees chairman gramm said neither the cbot nor the cftc 
moved slowly against stotler because of mahlmanns position 
certainly this commission has never shied away from taking 
action against well respected members of exchanges gramm told 
the panel 
but another committee member sen christopher bond rmo said 
in a written statement that incidents such as the stotler case 
only serve to strengthen support for a bush administrationbacked 
bill to strip the cftc of authority over stock index futures and 
give it to the rival securities and exchange commission 
the sec and the treasury department claim control of stock index 
futures which allow investors to trade on the markets movement 
through a large array of stocks without actually buying the 
underlying stocks is necessary to avoid sharp market fluctuations 
like the 1987 stock market crash 
the cftc and the futures industry oppose the move saying it 
will impede the futures markets 
an attempt to work out a compromise measure and include it in 
the senate farm bill ran out of time late last week 
bond said if a compromise to eliminate the turf battle between 
the cftc and the sec isnt reached he could easily be among those 
pushed into the treasury camp 
but leahy used the hearing to repeat his opposition to a 
jurisdictional swap 
i feel that the treasury department and the sec have acted in 
a highly irresponsible manner by pressing this idea in a way that 
has created a bitter political stalemate blocking reform bills 
for both the futures and securities markets said leahy 
he conceded that a compromise would have to be worked out or a 
bill reauthorizing the cftc and giving it added antifraud powers 
stands no chance of becoming law in the final weeks of this 
congress 
critics have questioned gramms numerous trips to texas in the 
twoandahalf years as cftc chairman 
she said she made nine trips in 1988 nine more last year and 
four so far this year 
while she conceded accompanying him to some fundraising 
events gramm said she didnt know who contributed because i 
dont look at the list of contributors 
her husband does not accept honoraria from organizations 
regulated by the cftc to avoid the appearance of a conflict of 
interest but i dont know if there are any regulatees of the 
commission who contribute to phils campaign because im not 
involved in that area she said

5050 joint venture with stateowned kuwait oil coin an area known 
as the neutral zone between kuwait and saudi arabia 
texaco spokeswoman anita larsen said about 80 percent of the 
refinerys 800 employees are saudi nationals and are 17 american

usowned refinery operating in iraq or kuwait 
the texacokuwait refinery produces about 135000 barrels a day 
out of three fields larsen said 
eight american oil field workers were reported missing near the 
border of kuwait and company officials suspected they had been

said they had no operations in kuwait and did not rely on oil from 
the middle east nation 
amoco spokesman michael thompson in chicago said that less than 
5 percent of the oil used in its us refineries was kuwaiti crude 
we have no reason to believe shipments from kuwait will be 
threatened he said and even if they were a shortterm loss 
of kuwait oil would not hinder our us refining operations 
chevron spokesman larry shushan said from his companys san 
francisco headquarters we do from time to time of course take 
oil from ports in that area it obviously is something we are quite 
concerned about because we are not going to be sending any ships 
into a war zone

has one employee of a lubricants subsidiary in kuwait spokesman 
norman altstedter said but no other operations 
he said shell oil imports no oil from kuwait but 60000 to 
80000 barrels a day from iraq about 6 percent of its crude oil 
capacity shortterm needs would be covered by inventories but 
altstedter said some adjustments may be needed on the companys 
longer term purchasing requirements 
exxon issued a statement saying it has imported some oil from 
iraq to the united states in recent months we are currently 
evaluating our situation and taking steps to minimize any impact on 
our customers worldwide it said 
although none of the companies was directly affected us oil 
company stocks rose sharply on news of the invasion which boosted 
oil prices
