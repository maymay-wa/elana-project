profound changes are at work in the american 
midwest sent reeling this decade with blows to its auto steel and 
farming powerhouses for autos the midwest was the place detroit 
the hub chicago and st louis also boasted auto plants now 
japanese automakers are setting up shop in rural largely white 
communities and jobs are becoming increasingly scarce for bigcity 
blacks the first story in a fourpart ap extra series the 
changing heartland examines this trend 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
with a college campus and fertile fields 
this patch of midamerica is a place where students learn and 
farmers earn side by side but corn country has a new face producing 
a new crop cars 
last fall this tranquil town and its twin city bloomington 
joined a growing number of smaller midwest locales with 
japaneseassociated plants that are shaking up the auto industry 
the increasing japanese presence in americas midsection plants 
in ohio michigan kentucky tennessee one planned for indiana and 
chryslermitsubishi here is creating work and growth in white 
rural areas while jobs and opportunity disappear in heavily minority 
big cities 
certainly its a restructuring of the auto industry said 
richard hill a michigan state university urban affairs and 
sociology professor the reorganization is definitely 
detrimental to blacks 
the trend has aroused concern in a business thats already lost 
thousands of bluecollar jobs raised questions about potential 
bias and worried blacks whove long regarded the auto industry as 
a steppingstone to a better life 
auto shops were really the bridge that brought black people 
from the lower class to the middle class said joe wilson former 
head of a united auto workers local at a closed detroit plant 
what are you going to do for the people left behind locked up in 
the ghetto who have no place to go and no car to get out to rural 
areas 
japanese automakers whove invested 5 billion in usbased 
facilities in the last decade point to their affirmative action 
programs and insist transportation education and the work ethic 
not race determine location but some academics also claim the 
japanese generally avoid unionized areas and towns with large pools 
of us autoworkers preferring to train novices 
whatever the reason communities such as bloomingtonnormal 
thriving whitecollar towns that are worlds apart from 
gaspingforsurvival bluecollar cities like detroit are becoming 
motor capitals 
its just a different culture said bloomington mayor jesse 
smart this whole city is like a big neighborhood and with 
modern auto plants being clean its not smokestack anymore its 
compatible with agriculture 
in bloomingtonnormal insurance farming and academia are big 
urban blight crime and unemployment are not 
bloomingtonnormal 4 percent minority had a 41 percent 
unemployment rate in october detroit 65 percent minority had a 
101 percent jobless level 
studies have shown black men have been devastated by industrial 
decline in the detroit area 52 percent of black men in heavy 
manufacturing production lost their jobs from 1979 to 1984 
according to a study by michigan states hill 
nationwide about 27 percent of blacks lost their heavy 
manufacturing jobs in the same period said the study based on 
equal employment opportunity commission reports 
future prospects are even bleaker 
a 1988 study concluded japanese behavior with regard to site 
location and hiring practices heightens rather than eases the 
dilemma of blacks who are being rapidly displaced from their 
traditional american employers 
the study by university of michigan professors robert cole and 
donald deskins said although they had no concrete evidence they 
believe avoidance of blacks is one factor for the japanese in 
determining plant sites 
i think its a factor deskins said i cant say this is 
their intent 
the study found while blacks comprise 11 percent of the civilian 
labor force they represent 172 percent of workers at the big three 
us automakers 
in contrast the study said mazda motor manufacturing usa 
corps plant in flat rock mich has a potential black labor pool 
of 29 percent and honda of america manufacturing inc in 
marysville ohio has one of 105 percent company officials say 
their black workforce is 151 percent and 51 percent respectively 
honda spokesman roger lambert disagreed with the calculations and 
also pointed out the company recruits at black colleges 
honda however agreed last march to give 6 million to 377 
blacks and women after an eeoc investigation concluded they should 
have been hired sooner 
the eeoc claimed honda employed discriminatory practices with a 
30mile hiring radius that excluded columbus ohio which has the 
areas largest minority population honda which expanded its hiring 
area before the settlement admitted no wrongdoing 
many japaneseassociated auto plants are close to universities 
and near interstate 75 dubbed auto alley which stretches south 
from michigan 
toyota is in georgetown ky near the university of kentucky 
chryslermitsubishi is in normal home of illinois state university 
while subaruisuzu automotive inc is near lafayette ind across 
the river from purdue 
these towns say automakers are attracted to cheaper land lower 
taxes open space and a welleducated work force 
bloomingtonnormal population 87718 was appealing because of 
its good highway and rail systems incentives strong work ethic and 
schools said g glenn gardner former chairman of diamondstar 
motors corp the firm formed by chrysler and mitsubishi 
we needed people with very good communication skills verbal 
written and reading he said some of the major larger cities 
have a very difficult time graduating significant numbers of 
students 
in tippecanoe county surrounding lafayette one in four people 
25 years and older has four years of college said mark davis 
president of greater lafayette progress inc a nonprofit 
development corporation 
what kind of public education system does detroit have he 
asked what kind of technological capability in terms of college 
graduates does detroit have 
theres no godgiven right big cities should be viewed as the 
automotive centers he said we small towns technologically 
sophisticated centers think we can compete too

they do engaging in fierce bidding wars offering free land and 
water road and sewer improvements employee training funds and tax 
abatements 
chryslermitsubishi received 887 million in state incentives 
alone including 630 acres of farm land 
nobody ever offered us a site in chicago detroit or 
st louis gardner said 
experts also say japanese automakers prefer areas where unions 
arent strong 
theyre afraid wages will be high said michael young 
director of the center for japanese legal studies at columbia 
university theyre afraid unions will create demands that will 
make the company unproductive 
mazda is atypical it is 25 miles from detroit and spokesman 
jim gill said the only wholly owned subsidiary of a japanese 
automaker with uaw affiliation 
if youre going to locate in michigan gill said you best 
be prepared to deal with the uaw 
mazda because of its location also has many former big three 
employees nearly a fourth of its workers 
but vladmir pucik international business professor at the 
university of michigan said the japanese prefer a relatively 
inexperienced labor force so they can train them in the japanese way 
of doing things they want to go somewhere so nobody will say at 
ford we did it differently 
gardner conceded chryslermitsubishi sought fresh faces 
we didnt want to have another car plant that would have 20 
years of experience transferred to our plant he said we wanted 
some green people when it comes to building cars 
but he said any suggestion race was involved in site selection 
was utter nonsense and any charge we selected a town to stay 
away from a union is absolutely and unequivocally dead wrong 
the plant was built with a 100 percent unionized labor force 
bloomington mayor smart says the japanese will be happy they 
built here 
when you get into any rural setting people are not afraid to 
put in long hours he said here theres a satisfaction in 
seeing the end result youre just bred that way

a chicago street gang member testified 
saturday that noah robinson ordered a hit to kill a former 
employee but the witness admitted he was promised money and 
leniency for cooperating with authorities 
robinson a chicago businessman and the halfbrother of jesse 
jackson is accused of hiring the el rukn gang to kill leroy 
hambone barber in greenville in january 1986 he pleaded 
innocent to the murder and conspiracy charges earlier this month 
henry leon harris jr known as toomba in the el rukn gang 
also has been charged with murder in the 1986 slaying harris said 
he was the brotherinlaw of jeff fort the gang leader who is 
serving time in a texas prison on drug charges 
testimony has described the el rukn as a violent organization 
that makes millions of dollars from the sale of narcotics 
murderforhire extortion and racketeering 
another former gang member eugene hunter testified friday that 
robinson was a close friend of fort and wielded some power in the 
organization 
robinson and barber were childhood friends in greenville and 
barber once worked for robinson in chicago 
circuit judge james moore agreed last week to combine in the same 
trial the charges stemming from the barber shooting and the charge 
that robinson conspired to kill janice denise rosemond a witness to 
the murder who survived a stabbing attack 
harris said he met robinson in chicago in 1985 but said he did 
not recall the month he robinson told us he needed hit duty 
when solicitor joe watson asked if robinson offered to pay for 
the murder harris testified that robinson mentioned 10000 
harris said that as a general in the el rukn he relayed the 
information to fort who told him and several other gang members to 
take care of it 
harris said that during another meeting at roinsons home the 
defendant gave them 2000 in expense money to travel to greenville 
he said a first attempt to kill barber failed because several 
members of the gang got into an argument over how to execute the 
killing the second trip to greenville ended in the fatal shooting 
of barber in front of a business owned by robinson 
during cross examination from robinsons attorney robert simone 
harris admitted that he lived a double life and that he 
sometimes lied 
harris also said he was promised as much as 100000 from federal 
authorities for information about barber and robinson 
simone described harris as a liar who makes deals to save his 
own life 
im telling the truth because i decided i was going to take 
control of my life harris maintained nobody not mr robinson 
and not jeff fort tells me what to do 
harris also testified the prosecution said it would not seek the 
death penalty against him in return for his cooperation 
your real interest right here now is delivering up noah 
robinson on a platter simone said you know very well that 
federal authorities wanted to get noah robinson 
robinson has maintained that federal authorities wanted to frame 
him to discredit jackson while the former democratic presidential 
hopeful said he had no recent contact with his halfbrother

the united states assertion that libya was 
building a chemical weapons plant involved luck oldfashioned 
spying hightechnology surveillance and meticulous analysis a 
newspaper reported sunday 
but it was the deaths of wild dogs in the libyan desert that 
provided the crucial clue that the plant was allegedly intended to 
produce chemical warfare weapons the los angeles times said 
a toxic spill of chemical wastes at the site last august 
apparently killed the dogs and panicked libyans breached security 
by using international phone lines to call the german firm helping 
them build the plant 
for the us intelligence analysts accumulating bits of 
information about the plant the excited telephone calls sealed the 
case they had been building 
the phone conversation was picked up by sophisticated electronic 
intelligence equipment reportedly revealing the nature of the plant 
and the involvement of west german firms 
libya has denied the charges saying the plant will produce 
pharmaceuticals 
sources have confirmed britishus cooperation in the detection 
but havent said whether us monitoring stations or wellplaced 
british listening posts in cyprus picked up the libyans call 
the discovery was the first time that us monitoring has exposed 
construction of a chemical warfare facility the newspaper said 
but weve got a long way to go before any of us can take 
comfort said stephen d bryen a recently retired deputy 
undersecretary for trade security policy at the pentagon the fact 
is that no government is very wellorganized to deal with this 
problem 
the compilation of data included satellite photos of a major 
construction project in the middle of nowhere the curious 
involvement of an arab businessman who used circuitous routes to 
ship equipment to libya and pictures of an oversized ventilation 
system usually associated with microtoxin production the times 
said 
robert kupperman an expert on arms and terrorism at the center 
for strategic and international studies in washington said 
biological weapons pose some of the most difficult detection 
problems because facilities can be smaller for example a batch of 
anthrax that could kill millions of people could be concocted in a 
room the size of a broom closet kupperman said

convicted murderer ted bundy confessed to at 
least nine killings while his lawyers maneuvered to block his 
execution scheduled for tuesday officials from two western states 
said saturday 
bundy confessed to killing at least eight young women in western 
washington state in 1974 investigator robert keppel of the 
washington attorney generals office said 
bundy also confessed to the 1975 slaying of a 26yearold vail 
colo ski shop employee whose body was never found vail police 
chief ken hughey said 
bundy who grew up in tacoma wash was scared shaken and 
tearful as he responded to questions from investigators keppel told 
kirotv of seattle on saturday night in a telephone interview from 
florida 
the man is trying to save his life keppel said 
bundy scheduled to die in the electric chair for the 
kidnapmurder of 12yearold kimberly leach in 1978 has been linked 
to as many as 36 killings and disappearances of young women in 
washington colorado utah and other western states 
the 42yearold law school dropout was visited saturday by 
officials from several western states and more interviews were 
scheduled for sunday said paul decker assistant warden at florida 
state prison in starke 
bundys lawyers lost two more bids for a stay of execution 
saturday us district judge g kendall sharp who in 1987 called 
bundy a diabolical genius and probably the most competent 
serial killer in the country at this time denied a request for a 
stay saturday morning 
a threejudge panel of the 11th us circuit court of appeals in 
atlanta denied bundys appeal in a telephone conference saturday 
afternoon without addressing any of the legal issues said court 
clerk matt davidson 
as a last resort attorneys can appeal to the us supreme court 
but the nations high court already refused to hear a separate bundy 
appeal tuesday 
bundy last week had offered to trade information about other 
slayings for a delay in his execution but gov bob martinez who 
signed bundys fourth death warrant jan 17 refused saying he 
would not negotiate with a killer 
bundy also has been sentenced to die for the murders of two 
florida state university sorority sisters but he had not previously 
admitted to any slayings 
hughey said bundy acknowledged killing julie cunningham who 
disappeared in vail march 15 1975 
detectives believe the confession is indeed valid he said 
noting bundys details about the victim her clothes and the vail 
area have been persuasive 
the police chief gave this recounting of what bundy said he 
approached her on crutches asking for help one of several ruses 
attributed to the suspected serial killer she agreed to carry his 
ski boots to his car where bundy knocked her unconscious with a 
metal bar 
the woman regained consciousness after 2030 miles west of 
glenwood springs colo but he knocked her unconscious again 
strangled her left her body where she fell and drove to utah he 
returned four or five weeks later and buried her 
in washington state bundy confessed to the eight ted 
murders said keppel who had been a police detective working on 
those cases in the 1970s witnesses had reported seeing a charming 
young stranger who called himself ted in the area where several 
victims disappeared 
for the parents of one victim central washington university 
student susan rancourt the confession helps write the final chapter 
to a tragedy 
its been an open wound for 15 years and every time we think 
its settling down something happens said miss rancourts 
mother vivian rancourt of laconner wash there will always be 
that loss that we cannot replace but at least we can put it all 
together 
keppel said bundy admitted to three additional washington state 
killings but he was at a loss to say whether bundy was telling 
the truth about those cases or just trying to buy time keppel said 
bundy provided no details of the three additional killings 
keppel said bundy confirmed in addition to the deaths of the 
eight victims that some unidentified bones found near the east 
seattle suburb of issaquah where two victims were found were those 
of georgann hawkins a university of washington student who 
disappeared from an alley behind her sorority house on june 11 1974 
her remains had never been found although king county police 
considered her a ted victim 
keppel hopes to talk to bundy again sunday he said 
john tanner a defense attorney before being elected a prosecutor 
in the daytona beach area in november told the orlando sentinel 
late friday that bundy called him last tuesday and said i want to 
tell it all but it will take longer than six days 
tanner who befriended bundy and has acted as a spiritual adviser 
for two years told the sentinel he believes it could take as long 
as several months for bundy to tell detectives everything they want 
to know including where the remains of some victims are 
bundy had over 10 years to tell what he had to tell and if he 
is now telling all thats nice im pleased but his execution 
shouldnt be delayed any longer said attorney general bob 
butterworth 
tanner on saturday did not return telephone calls from the 
associated press

sixteen years after the supreme court legalized 
abortions americans views remain sharply split on the issue the 
new york times reported sunday 
polls over the years have found a majority of americans 
consistently support legalized abortion when the womans health is 
endangered when the pregnancy results from rape or incest or if 
the baby might be born with a birth defect 
but the support dips below 50 percent when the reason a woman 
wants an abortion is that she is unmarried does not want the baby 
or is too poor 
although recent polls indicate that a majority of americans do 
not want the landmark jan 22 1973 supreme court decision roe vs 
wade overturned other polls indicate support for legalized 
abortions is dropping 
tom w smith director of general social surveys for the national 
opinion research center in chicago said the differing results stem 
from how pollsters phrase questions 
the reason you get different results is that there are 10 
percent of the people who are absolutely against abortion except 
maybe to save the mothers life and 30 percent who are for abortion 
on demand and that leaves 60 percent who swing back and forth 
conditionally depending on what trimester of pregnancy and what 
circumstances youre talking about he said 
the times said other polling experts agree that more people are 
more likely to say they favor abortion when the question is framed 
in terms of a womans right to choose than when the question 
talks about protecting an unborn child

solidarity on sunday accepted a communist 
party offer to hold talks on legalizing the outlawed trade union 
movement and said the negotiations should begin as soon as 
possible 
they would be the first formal talks between solidarity and 
authorities since the union was crushed in a december 1981 
crackdown solidarity the first independent trade union in the 
soviet bloc was outlawed a year later 
asked if the agreement between the union and authorities 
represented a victory solidarity leader lech walesa said i am a 
practical man and practice will show how far poles can go in 
agreement 
his comments came during an impromptu news conference that was 
held after solidaritys leadership accepted the government offer and 
he took a few minutes to address 5000 people who attended a mass at 
st brygidas church 
walesa wore a solidarity pin on his lapel and a tie clasp given 
to him by george bush when the american visited poland as vice 
president last year 
the solidarity leader who appeared very happy said the union 
could be ready within two months to hold its first nationwide 
congress since martial law was declared in december 1981 
after the mass 1000 people marched from the church chanting 
solidarity solidarity legalize solidarity police blocked the 
procession after it had gone a few blocks and it disbanded 
peacefully 
in a statement sunday ending nearly two days of talks of the 
unions leadership solidarity said it is willing to respect the law 
and its original 1980 statute it called on the government to 
respect the conventions of the un international labor organization 
guaranteeing trade union freedoms 
the decision to accept the offer for talks was adopted 
unanimously with one abstention of the unions national executive 
commission which is made up of about 20 regional leaders from 
across poland 
on thursday the ruling polish united workers party announced a 
new stance endorsing more than one trade union organization 
the party offered to legalize solidarity under terms to be 
negotiated if the union respects the law and agrees to help reform 
the economy 
solidarity said the government has met its conditions for 
beginning talks on legalizing it and on the social and economic 
problems facing poland 
it is necessary to start negotiations as soon as possible they 
should have a realistic and concrete character and public opinion 
should be informed about it fully the commission said 
on our side we express the will to act according to the law and 
according to the statute of our union in the spirit of the superior 
interests of poland 
solidarity called for agreement on a reform program to confront 
polands dramatic economic ecological and material situation 
the statement opens the way for formal talks to begin with 
authorities at a talks first proposed by the government during a 
wave of strikes in august 
walesa had demanded that the party make a political decision to 
legalize solidarity before he would join the talks 
both sides have said they are ready to talk and it appeared that 
negotiations could begin very quickly perhaps within the next few 
weeks

the document on human rights and security 
35 nations approved in vienna this month has narrowed the gap 
between east and west but widened some fissures in their alliances 
both superpowers praise the agreement which promises broader 
individual freedoms and provides for new arms talks as a herald of 
future disarmament successes 
the ultimate success of the 27month conference that produced the 
document however has stirred unrest within the blocs led by 
washington and moscow 
european members of the north atlantic treaty organization show 
increasing resistance to us views of how disarmament should 
proceed on their continent 
warsaw pact allies of the soviet union demonstrate markedly 
different degrees of commitment to the human rights protections 
spelled out in the vienna accord 
whether the internal divisions will develop into disabling rifts 
will depend in large part on the superpower leaders 
president bush is expected to continue reagan administration 
policies on disarmament but mounting pressure from europe could 
produce an approach more receptive to the kremlin 
president mikhail s gorbachevs reform program has met 
resistance at home and in some nations of the soviet bloc at the 
moment gorbachev desperately needs to cut arms spending as a way of 
stabilizing the economy and improving the living standard 
western allies are aware of the pressure he faces and of the 
serious consequences for arms control if gorbachevs conservative 
opponents gain the upper hand 
us diplomats concede the vienna conference succeeded primarily 
because of the soviet reforms 
earlier this month the state department said release of 
political prisoners easing of emigration and more tolerant policies 
on free speech and religious practice changed the american position 
on the soviet proposal for a 1991 human rights conference in moscow 
agreement on a final document in vienna was delayed because 
western nations objected to holding such a meeting in moscow the 
conference was one of several since 1975 when the united states 
canada and all european nations except albania signed the helsinki 
agreements on european security and cooperation 
the vienna statement approved jan 15 proclaims the right of all 
citizens to assemble speak their minds travel emigrate and 
monitor compliance of their governments 
it sets ambitious goals for better trade relations and 
environmental protection and mandates new negotiations on reducing 
conventional military forces in europe to begin march 9 in vienna 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze of the soviet union in 
vienna for the closing session described the agreement as the 
result of commitment and compromise 
he said the kremlin would disclose the numbers of its soldiers 
and armaments in europe before the new talks begin arguments and 
secrecy surrounding the relative strength of forces have hamstrung 
existing negotiations that began 15 years ago 
asked why he was so confident the new forum would avoid the 
pitfalls of the old shevardnadze said the alliances were under 
increasing pressure to improve the international climate 
its something our peoples want and their governments if they 
are true governments should express the will of the people he 
told reporters 
in his speech to the conference shevardnadze said the kremlin 
would remove some shortrange nuclear weapons from eastern europe 
and asked nato to negotiate withdrawal of the remaining 
europeanbased missiles with ranges of 300 miles or less 
all missiles of intermediate range are being withdrawn and 
dismantled under an accord signed in washington in december 1987 
and negotiators report good progress on a pact to cut stockpiles of 
longrange weapons 
washington has said repeatedly it does not want to give up 
shortrange nuclear arms until a soviet advantage in conventional 
forces is reduced 
theres not going to be anything left except the shortrange 
a senior us diplomat said if we want to keep the flexible 
response doctrine credible i dont see any way we can negotiate 
these in the foreseeable future 
that nato doctrine holds that the west must retain its nuclear 
option until the soviet advantage in troops tanks artillery and 
other conventional weapons is reduced 
west germany and other nato members however have been chafing 
under that and other constraints on the pace of disarmament 
stephen ledogar the us ambassador to the forthcoming talks 
said washington wants to see a soviet reduction in conventional 
forces first but added im not trying to suggest there is no 
difference of opinion within the alliance 
within the warsaw pact the soviet unions planned pullouts are 
popular with the masses but worrisome for some leaderships 
even more divisive is the question of human rights and the 
varying degrees of willingness among the eastbloc allies to emulate 
the gorbachev policies of glasnost and perestroika

as george bush looks to the middle east in 
the first days of his presidency he will find soviet and european 
leaders jostling to share the stage in the peace process that once 
seemed an american monopoly 
the united states remains the regions most important outside 
power but it no longer holds the solo role of matchmaker it played 
in the 1979 egyptianisraeli treaty 
i believe that europe is making can make and will make a 
considerable contribution toward this middle east peace 
settlement lord plumb president of the european parliament said 
in jordan this month 
the europeans have played a pathfinding role that often has 
complimented american actions as well as channeling them 
their contacts with the palestine liberation organization helped 
both legitimize the organization and prod it toward more moderate 
positions that opened the way for a dialogue with washington 
european calls for israeli compromise have underscored quieter 
us pressure on the jewish state 
sweden was a crucial mediator late last year to draw the united 
states back into contact with the plo after a 13year us boycott 
spains embassy in tunis hosted clandestine meetings to help pave 
the way for those talks 
its foreign minister delegated by the 12nation european 
community visited israeli leaders this month and urged them to 
respond to plo peace efforts 
soviet officials pressured their leftist allies in the plo to 
accept israel renounce terrorism and endorse un peace 
resolutions setting the stage for the usplo dialogue 
both the soviet union and china have improved relations with 
israel partly in expectation of a role in arabisraeli peace talks 
european parliamentarians and ministers have paraded through the 
holy land on political pilgrimages lecturing irritated israeli 
leaders on the need to compromise 
italian spanish greek british scandinavian and east european 
leaders have met plo chief yasser arafat to encourage the plos 
shift from the gun to the conference table france upgraded the plo 
mission in paris to a general delegation a step short of 
diplomatic recognition 
the barrage of activity led israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir 
to accuse the european community on jan13 of a love affair with 
the plo 
he insisted the community cannot bring us closer to the plo 
that depends only on us they have no right to impose solutions or 
to apply economic pressure 
americas long boycott of the plo eventually achieved a key aim 
the organization last month embraced the moderate stands washington 
had demanded to help sow the seeds of a possible peace settlement 
but the us isolation of the plo worked both ways 
its repeated efforts to find an alternative to the plo were all 
but demolished by the 13monthold palestinian uprising which 
evoked a storm of proplo sentiment in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip 
the policy also caused popular hostility to american policy 
throughout the arab world whose governments unanimously insist the 
plo is central to any settlement 
washington was unable to get shamir to agree on the usbacked 
concept of trading occupied arab land for peace the heart of all 
major middle east peace efforts over the past 20 years 
the united states largely stood by as israeli troops invaded 
lebanon and bombed beirut in 1982 then reneged on a promise to 
protect palestinian refugees after the plos withdrawal from lebanon 
congress blocked a key arms deal for jordan considered the arab 
key to american middle east peace plans infuriating king hussein 
by 1984 hussein said the united states had ruled itself out as a 
sole peace mediator together with arafat he embraced a 
sovietinspired call for the five permanent members of the un 
security council to oversee arabisraeli peace talks 
that plan eventually won broad european support as frustrated 
arabs increasingly asked western europe to pressure the united 
states to influence israel 
europe responded keeping an eye on its major economic interests 
in the region and mindful of the perils of war between increasingly 
wellarmed rivals on its southern flank

police hurling tear gas grenades 
battled thousands of protesters who tried to march through seoul on 
sunday to demand the overthrow of president roh taewoo and the 
expulsion of us troops 
dozens of the estimated 5000 radicals were injured or detained 
when 6000 riot troopers charged them but police had no figures on 
injuries or arrests 
the demonstrators chanting yankee go home and down with 
roh taewoo were trying to reach the headquarters of the 
governing democratic justice party 
troopers in green combat fatigues and black visored helmets 
blocked the march and retaliated with tear gas when some protesters 
threw firebombs and rocks to try to force their way 
the riot police charged the protesters forcing many to flee 
downstairs into subway stations where some were trampled or hit by 
people leaping from above 
police beat and kicked groups of protesters who were surrounded 
by the charging security forces other protesters hurled scores of 
firebombs and some police were beaten to the ground by radicals 
using clubs and fists 
you are the enemies of our people an enraged man yelled at 
police 
clashes continued for more than an hour along one of seouls main 
shopping avenues hundreds of terrified pedestrians ran to escape 
the fighting and clouds of tear gas 
demonstrators repeatedly called for removal of the 42000 us 
troops based in south korea under a mutual defense treaty 
an effigy representing roh president bush and top korean 
industrialists was burned during the march the rally before the 
march also demanded an end to controls on labor unions 
the protest was the first action organized by a new dissident 
alliance the national coalition for a democratic movement which 
was formed saturday by about 20 dissident labor and student groups 
coalition leaders said it was the largest dissident group ever 
formed in south korea and claimed a membership of 30000 people 
coalition leaders pledged to seek the fall of the roh government 
charging it is a front for military rule the coalition also called 
for an end to south koreas powerful industrial conglomerates and to 
all foreign influence 
the coalition claims it will launch a movement of students 
workers and farmers to remove roh and create a society of 
equality for workers and the poor 
lee buyoung a leader of the new group said since the 
organization is based on grassroots groups it will be able to 
resist any government oppression and struggle for national 
development 
formation of a similar dissident alliance in may 1987 was a key 
event in sparking major antigovernment protests that forced the 
authoritarian government of president chun doohwan to agree to 
democratic presidential elections 
roh won the election and his government has introduced broad 
democratic reforms radicals refuse to accept that there have been 
democratic reforms and claim the nation is still ruled by the 
military and powerful industrialists 
the radicals appear to lack substantial public support but their 
violent protests make them a powerful force in domestic politics 
roh warned last week that radicals were a threat to political 
stability and ordered a harsh crackdown

the budget director who will help write 
president bushs fiscal 1990 spending plan gave a senate committee 
an early peek at the basic framework last week along with 
acknowledgment that it will not elicit unanimous applause from 
congress 
i would love it if we could do something you wouldnt 
criticize richard darman told members of the senate governmental 
affairs committee at his confirmation hearing but i dont think 
well be able to meet that test 
darman whose nomination as director of the office of management 
and budget could be approved by the senate this week spent most of 
his five hours before the committee on thursday fencing with 
democrats eager to find holes in bushs campaign pledge of no new 
taxes 
but the 45yearold former investment banker deputy treasury 
secretary and white house aide also gave some indications of what 
bushs revisions to the budget former president reagan presented on 
jan 9 will look like 
and he gave hints as to how the new president will honor his 
campaign pledges to support education research and other 
priorities while grappling with the federal deficit the 
administration says the imbalance would reach 127 billion this year 
without savings well above the 100 billion cap set by the 
grammrudman deficit reduction law 
asked about education spending darman responded youll see a 
lot of emphasis on the role the federal government can play in 
providing leadership in regard to education 
but in the next breath he said there would be only a modest 
increase in federal education spending he suggested that 
instead the government could provoke improvements in education by 
other unspecified means 
he said the budget would provide tax breaks and other incentives 
to spur research and development 
he said that in looking for savings bush would not reduce the 
giant social security program but he said the growth of spending 
for medicare which provides medical services for the elderly and 
handicapped would be reined in he provided no figures 
defense which accounts for more than onequarter of reagans 
115 trillion budget will not receive the boost of 2 percent 
growth above inflation that reagan gave it darman said again he 
offered no specifics 
he insisted that bushs flexible freeze plan a brew of spending 
increases that rises no faster than inflation along with no tax 
increases could reduce the deficit and eventually balance the 
budget 
but he left the door open to retain the 13 billion in asset 
sales user fee increases and other revenue raisers that reagan 
inserted into his spending plan darman insisted that none of those 
items can be considered taxes a viewpoint democrats in congress are 
already disputing 
darman said the blueprint would be longer than the 12page 
document submitted by president nixon when he succeeded lyndon 
johnson in 1969 but would not be as comprehensive as the sixvolume 
budget reagan submitted earlier this month 
bushs document darman said would specify what the particular 
programs are he wishes to emphasize 
those yettocome details are what congress and the new 
administration will wrestle over for months to come

sarah ferguson was lauded as a breath of fresh air 
in the stuffy world of royal protocol when she married prince andrew 
2 years ago but today the duchess of york is known in some 
quarters as her royal idleness 
britains brassy tabloids also are calling her duchess 
dolittle for what they view as her love of holidays and 
jetsetting lifestyle 
a recent scorecard listing the public engagements of britains 
royal family put andrew a royal navy lieutenant at the bottom with 
only 30 last year 
sarah was next with 55 less than half those performed by her 
husbands 88yearold grandmother queen mother elizabeth 
buckingham palace noted that andrew as a naval officer was not 
expected to have other commitments and that sarah gave birth to 
their first child in august 
but a public opinion poll published sunday in news of the world 
indicated 34 percent of britons surveyed believe the 29yearold 
duchess does not earn the 150000 she and her husband receive 
yearly from the government for royal duties 
her royal idleness the newspapers headline blared 
freeloading fergie is the most unpopular member of the royal 
family its story said 
the newspaper said market and opinion research international ltd 
polled 501 adults last week no margin of error was given 
news about queen elizabeth ii and her family sells newspapers in 
britain and the duchess has suffered her share of barbs since she 
first was linked to andrew more than three years ago 
at first the duchess was lauded for her breezy style and 
friendly open manner but she slowly became a target mainly for 
her healthy appetite sometimes plump figure and fashion gaffes 
after an official visit to california last march even the 
serious newspapers said sarah and andrews behavior had been brash 
and vulgar particularly her bold repartee with audiences 
as the duchess gained weight last summer during the later months 
of her pregnancy the tabloids delighted in publishing unflattering 
photographs of her 
criticism intensified last fall when she left her newborn baby 
princess beatrice at home with a nanny for six weeks while she went 
to australia on official business and holidays 
the attacks reached a crescendo last week when sarah and andrew 
went skiing at klosters switzerland where maj hugh lindsay a 
close friend of the royal family died last year in an avalanche 
that narrowly missed prince charles heir to the throne 
critics considered the trip an excessive holiday and unseemly 
because it came only a year after the tragedy 
the daily mirror which branded sarah duchess dolittle said 
she sobbed after daily briefings by aides on the tabloid attacks 
the duchess flew to london on friday to attended a memorial 
service for the 34 people killed in a tripletrain crash in south 
london in december it was one of only six public engagements she 
has scheduled until march according to buckingham palaces official 
list 
the sunday times of london which usually does not focus on the 
private lives of the royal family said the duchess was suffering 
from a general cooling in relations between the palace and the media 
the chill is largely due to the royal familys failure to attend 
a memorial service in lockerbie scotland for victims of the dec 
21 crash of pan am flight 103 and the decision to send prince 
philip to the funeral of japans emperor hirohito many british 
veterans still consider hirohito a war criminal 
whether the activities of the duchess are an embarrassment and 
a disgrace or whether she is merely fulfilling a popular need for a 
bete noir in the nations most popular soap opera is debatable 
the sunday times said

from the middle east to the homeless on 
americas streets ronald reagan left his successor a host of 
problems that defied resolution during his own white house years 
some problems particularly the federal budget deficit are 
manifestly worse than they were when reagan inherited them from 
jimmy carter during the presidential turnover eight years earlier 
aids was unheard of in 1981 although the deadly sexually 
transmitted virus was already spreading through its victims to 
date it has claimed the lives of more than 46000 americans and no 
cure is in sight 
the national debt was 930 billion when reagan moved into the 
oval office now george bush has inherited a debt that has soared 
past 26 trillion and is growing at the rate of 155 billion a year 
the trade deficit has abated from a peak of 170 billion in 1987 
but the united states still imports 11 billion more than it exports 
each month 
the spread of homelessness across urban america and into its 
suburbs has been a nagging reminder that the fiveplus years of 
unbroken economic growth have also left some americans behind 
on the health front 37 million americans now have no health 
insurance up from 30 million or fewer at the end of the 1970s most 
are in working class families not poor enough to qualify for 
medicaid with their breadwinners in lowpaying jobs that offer few 
fringe benefits like health insurance 
health care costs were soaring much faster than the general rate 
of inflation when reagan took office and they are still hurtling 
forward 
efforts by the governments medicare and medicaid programs as 
well as private insurers such as blue cross to demand more 
efficiency from hospitals and physicians had mixed results 
the nation pays more than 500 billion for health care or 112 
percent of its gross national product far more than any other 
nation but ranks 19th in the world on infant mortality 
reagan accelerated a pentagon buildup that carter had begun but 
it came to halt midway through his second term and now bush is 
faced with the task of cutting the militarys spending plans by 200 
billion or more over the next several years 
among the most expensive military plans is reagans strategic 
defense initiative which will cost far more than the current 
research budget of 4 billionplus if bush makes good on his promise 
to press ahead with the research and ultimately deploy the 
spacebased shield against nuclear attack 
while bush made political hay during the campaign over democrat 
michael dukakis opposition to both a mobile mx and the midgetman 
missile he acknowledged after the election that the nation probably 
cannot afford both modernized land missiles and that his defense 
secretary john tower will have a painful choice to make 
the problems of the savings and loan industry which the general 
accounting office says may cost 112 billion to fix have landed on 
bushs lap even with the federal home loan bank boards bailouts of 
217 sick sampls there are still 350 insolvent sampls and 150 others 
nearing the brink 
the energy department says it will cost up to 128 billion over 
the next two decades to clean up nuclear arms plants and research 
facilities a problem which only in recent months has worked its way 
into the public consciousness the only three reactors capable of 
producing tritium a vital ingredient in the nations nuclear arms 
stockpile have been shut down by safety problems 
reagan left office with nine americans still hostage in lebanon 
the bombing of pan am flight 103 before christmas with the loss of 
270 lives dramatized that terrorism remains a scourge on the world 
scene 
despite a late opening of talks with the palestine liberation 
organization little progress was made under reagan toward bringing 
the nations in the middle east together toward a peaceful resolution 
of their long deepseated hostilities 
reagan and his successor bush can point to such positive 
developments in the past year as the cease fire in the iraniraq 
war the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan and a usengineered 
settlement in angola 
in central america congress put an end to us support for the 
contras in nicaragua and the sandinista government there no longer 
faces sustained attacks from the anticommunist rebels 
a solution to the problem of staggering third world debts much 
of it owed by latin nations to us banks eluded james baker iii as 
reagans treasury secretary now as bushs secretary of state 
baker again will be faced with the problem of how to promote 
prosperity among the us neighbors to the south 
many experts fear that the hemispheres turn away from 
dictatorships and toward democratic institutions will be reversed if 
interest on the debts continues to sap the economies of south 
america

one man mailed his beard to the fire chief 
but in the end there wasnt a whisker of real protest from the 
formerly hirsute lynn firefighters forced to face the new year 
cleanly shaven 
fire chief curtis numberg said beards had to go because the 
makers of oxygen masks said hairy jaws prevent a tight seal 
so beards are now out of the question we were one of the last 
large fire department to overlook beards before said numberg who 
was once bearded himself and these days contents himself with a 
mustache 
about 30 men out of 245 in the department went under the razor 
some contemplated going to their doctors to get a note saying 
they couldnt shave because their skin was too tender numberg 
said 
the beard in the mail was sent anonymously but it was a 
telltale color that numberg told the boston sunday herald he thinks 
he recognizes 
i sent a message back saying i was having it tested for drugs

the pullout by general motors 
corp in 1986 has proved to be a windfall for the south african 
executives who took over the company according to survey published 
sunday 
delta motors the south africanowned firm formed when the us 
carmaker left was rated the biggest success story among 16 
corporations formed in a similar fashion and surveyed by a 
johannesburg newspaper the sunday star 
since gms withdrawal delta motors has expanded its work force 
by 600 and returned to profitability following five years of losses 
through 1986 according to the survey sales have increased from 
24000 units in 1986 to 40000 in 1988 the survey said 
deltas personnel director george stegmann was quoted as saying 
employees considered delta a better employer than gm and had staged 
no strikes or work stoppages since the change 
according to stegmann 67 percent of deltas work force is black 
or mixedrace compared to 62 percent under gm 
stegmann said delta was continuing to invest in social programs 
but was aiming these more at its work force than gm did 
he was quoted as saying gms social programs were financed 
directly from the us headquarters irrespective of the business 
performance of the local subsidiary translating into vast amounts 
of money being disbursed to external social projects at times when 
employees were being retrenched 
employers found it difficult to understand why so much was done 
for others when their own needs were not addressed stegmann was 
quoted as telling the star 
executives of other companies surveyed by the newspaper also 
reported that the effects of disinvestment had been positive 
roughly 150 us companies have withdrawn from south africa in 
the past four years generally citing economic factors or pressure 
from the antiapartheid movement in most cases the operations were 
taken over by white south african managers

former ugandan dictator idi amin who 
angered saudi authorities by slipping out of the country will be 
allowed to return and resume his life in exile an authoritative 
saudi source said sunday 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity said king fahd 
was acting in response to requests by unidentified african leaders 
he refused to say whether amin had returned or whether a date had 
been fixed for that 
the african leaders reportedly included king hassan ii of 
morocco who has close ties with the saudi monarch and president 
mobuto sese seku of zaire 
amin 61 was ousted from his east african nation in 1979 and was 
granted political asylum in saudi arabia in 1980 
he slipped out of the desert kingdom on a forged passport and 
surfaced in kinshasa the zairean capital with one of his sons on 
jan 13 
uganda immediately demanded amins extradition to stand trial for 
the death of tens of thousands of his political opponents during the 
eight years of his tyrannical rule newspaper reports alleged amin 
also practiced cannibalism but these reports have not been 
independently verified 
following his arrival in kinshasa zaire deported him to senegal 
so that he could catch a flight back to saudi arabia 
but the senegal authorities sent amin back to kinshasa after the 
saudi authorities refused to take him back because of his abuse of 
their hospitality 
an arab diplomat said the former dictator has long been unpopular 
with his saudi hosts for meddling in african politics and for his 
links with personalities opposed to the ugandan government 
on jan 18 a report from kinshasa said he had been deported 
again and was returning to saudi arabia 
however there has been no official confirmation of his return 
and saudi officials have refused to comment on all aspects of the 
story 
people in the red sea port of jiddah said they could not say 
whether he had returned to his residence there a guarded remote 
villa outside the city 
diplomatic sources said they believe amin is still in zaire 
the ugandan embassy in riyadh has been saying all along that it 
does not know where amin is

two years after burning bodies were found 
in a ceramics factorys kilns members of a prominent family who ran 
a mortuary face trial for alleged mass cremations and removal of 
organs and gold from corpses 
the case has conjured up holocaustlike images of bodies packed 
into ovens and produced preliminary testimony that one member of the 
family was called hitler by his employees and engaged in 
strongarm tactics 
david sconce 32 and his parents jerry sconce 55 and 
laurieanne lamb sconce 52 are accused of 67 counts including 
multiple cremation of human remains and unlawful removal of body 
parts from human remains 
they deny the charges 
their trial was scheduled to begin monday but los angeles county 
deputy district attorney jo ann glidden said friday it is expected 
to be postponed because attorneys have other case commitments 
david sconce on friday was ordered to stand trial by himself on 
one count of conspiracy to murder the owner of a cremation society 
that sconce once wanted to take over ms glidden said she will seek 
to consolidate the two cases 
the scandal has already produced a state law allowing crematory 
inspection on demand and lawsuits have been filed against 100 
mortuaries that used the sconces cremation service on behalf of 
families of 17000 decedents cremated between march 1983 and 
december 1986 
the case involves the lamb funeral home was founded in 1929 by 
mrs sconces grandfather coastal cremations inc of which david 
sconce was president and coastal international eye and tissue bank 
coastal cremations charged other mortuaries only 55 per 
cremation and sought business widely as the use of cremation boomed 
in california 
on jan 20 1987 authorities in hesperia responded to complaints 
of odors at david sconces oscar ceramics plant in the desert and 
found burning bodies in its furnaces and cans of human ashes 
the investigation led to shocking testimony 
officials alleged the mortuary and tissue bank removed and sold 
gold teeth plus brains bones corneas and other organs without 
consent of nextofkin embezzlement of interest from prepaid 
funeral trust accounts illegal cremation of more than one body at a 
time and comingling of ashes 
it is a felony to dismember human corpses in california and a 
misdemeanor for crematoriums to burn bodies together without the 
permission of survivors 
david edwards a driver for the crematory from 1983 to december 
1985 testified at one hearing that david sconce paid to have 
funeral directors beaten pried gold teeth from corpses and boasted 
of the number of bodies he could burn at one time 
edwards said he and two others divided 750 for attacking the 
directors whom david sconce feared would publish allegations of 
multiple cremations in an industry magazine 
he wanted them messed up and hospitalized said the witness 
who has pleaded guilty to assault 
he said he often saw as many as a dozen bodies in the crematory 
retorts or ovens i looked at it as gore it was sickening he 
said 
edwards said david sconce sometimes spoke about setting records 
for stacking bodies it was over 13 and the old records were 
continually being broken he said 
he told of holding a flashlight while david sconce pulled gold 
teeth from the mouths of a dozen corpses and said he once saw him 
smash a corpses jaw with a crowbar to get at gold teeth 
the prosecution has not calculated the number of bodies that 
allegedly were handled illegally by lamb 
they were cremating like 8000 bodies a year she said and 
multiple cremations were conducted on a daily basis

plo chairman yasser arafat on sunday 
rejected a proposal for limited selfrule for palestinians in the 
occupied territories and elections to choose peace negotiators 
it isnt worth the trouble to reply to these proposals which 
have been rejected even by palestinian children arafat told a 
group of reporters it is a new attempt to get out of the 
bottleneck in which israel has found itself 
the palestine liberation organization chief was in baghdad for a 
meeting of palestinian leaders involved with the 13month uprising 
in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
a peace plan proposed last week by israeli defense minister 
yitzak rabin calls for a period of limited selfrule for 
palestinians in the territories followed by a threeway 
confederation of israel jordan and palestine 
rabin also said if the palestinians halted the uprising they 
could hold elections to choose peace negotiators 
other palestinian leaders also have rejected the plan which 
israel says was rabins private proposal jordans foreign minister 
marwan kassem also rejected it ammans daily ad dustour reported 
sunday 
kassem was quoted as saying israel is required to withdraw from 
the arab lands they occupied in 1967 then to give the palestinians 
an opportunity to set up their palestinian state in the gaza strip 
and the west bank 
earlier sunday in nicosia cyprus arafat called on arab kings 
presidents and princes to rally in support of the revolt 
he said the uprising will continue until our people establish 
their own independent state with jerusalem as its capital 
according to a statement issued in nicosia by the palestinian news 
agency wafa 
in baghdad arafat accused rabin of stepping up repression in the 
occupied territories in an attempt to halt the rebellion 
arafat spoke surrounded by members of the plo executive committee 
and several palestinian leaders he said had traveled from the 
occupied territories 
he said he was chairing meetings to discuss means of escalating 
resistance in response to tougher israeli measures to crack down 
on the uprising 
last week rabin announced a policy that allows troops to fire 
plastic bullets more freely at stonethrowers and palestinians 
setting up roadblocks the rules also call for destroying the homes 
of suspected stonethrowers 
arafat said he will ask western european nations to play a 
greater role in middle east peace efforts when he meets the foreign 
ministers of spain france and greece in madrid on friday 
he also said the plo is seeking a meeting of the united nations 
security council to discuss the situation in the occupied 
territories 
arab newspapers meanwhile reported efforts to arrange a meeting 
between secretary of state james baker and arafat who last month 
renounced terrorism and recognized israels right to exist the 
united states subsequently dropped its 13year ban on talking with 
the plo 
abu dhabis staterun daily newspaper alittihad said sunday that 
egypt invited baker to visit the middle east to pave the way for an 
international peace conference on the region 
the newspaper quoting unidentified sources in cairo said 
egypts intensive current efforts with washington are aimed at 
arranging a meeting between arafat and baker during that tour 
the saudi arabian newspaper almadina quoted unidentified sources 
as saying consultations were under way to set up an arafatbaker 
meeting in tunis in february

attorney general dick thornburgh speaking on 
the 16th anniversary of the supreme courts landmark decision 
legalizing abortion said sunday it was his guess that the court 
would reverse itself this year and allow states to outlaw abortion 
should that happen thornburgh said he would support prosecution 
of those involved in illegal abortions but he was not specific and 
did not answer directly when asked whether he would favor 
prosecution of women who illegally terminated a pregnancy 
sunday was the anniversary of the jan 22 1973 decision in roe 
vs wade but many of the annual demonstrations by antiabortion and 
prochoice groups marking the decision were scheduled for monday 
president bush is scheduled to speak by telephone to a monday 
march organized by the national right to life committee president 
reagan made several such calls during his administration 
the supreme court last year agreed to review a missouri case in 
which a lower federal court struck down as unconstitutional a 
stringent state antiabortion law in its appeal the state urged 
reversal of roe vs wade and the reagan administration filed a 
brief calling the missouri case an appropriate opportunity to 
reconsider the 1973 decision 
i think what we have to look for is what kind of approach the 
court takes if they do overturn roe vs wade thornburgh said on 
the nbc program meet the press my guess is that they will 
return the regulation of abortions like many health and safety 
questions to the states 
thornburgh said he was not predicting the outcome of the case 
and characterized his comments as strictly a guess 
but he also said the administration was confident it would 
prevail in the missouri case william l webster vs reproductive 
health services webster is the missouri state attorney general 
asked about possible prosecutions in the event the high court 
reversed roe vs wade thornburgh said those decisions would have to 
be made at the state level but he added 
i think the key is that there are certain classes of abortion 
that would be beyond the class of being legally able to be carried 
out and this would call for prosecution he did not answer 
directly when asked if he personally favored prosecution of women 
who illegally obtained abortions saying again that such decisions 
would be made by states 
thornburgh defended the administrations position on abortion 
when asked whether bush had considered polls showing that a majority 
of americans believe a woman should have the right to choose 
abortion 
you want to follow public opinion where you can but there are 
also matters of principle involved and these are matters that the 
president feels strongly about thornburgh said 
the supreme court most recently reaffirmed roe vs wade in 1983 
but the current court is viewed as deeply divided on the issue its 
two most junior justices antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
both conservatives appointed by reagan have not voted in an 
abortion decision

white house national security adviser brent 
scowcroft said sunday it would be premature to arrange a 
highlevel bush administration meeting with palestinian leader 
yasser arafat until arafats intentions are more clearly known 
scowcrofts comments came amid arab press reports that spoke of 
intensifying arab efforts to arrange a meeting between arafat 
chairman of the palestine liberation organization and secretary of 
statedesignate james a baker iii 
we already have established discussions with chairman arafat 
and it seems to me we ought to explore and probe what he sees as the 
evolution of this scowcroft said on abctvs this week with 
david brinkley 
he noted that the united states decided to resume contacts with 
the plo because arafat came around to the us view on recognizing 
israels right to exist 
what has happened in our changed policy toward arafat is not a 
new united states initiative scowcroft said the chairman 
couldve had that at any time since 1975 then he decided to do what 
he finally did now it seems to me we find out what it is he has 
in mind 
asked specifically about the desirability of a meeting between 
baker and arafat scowcroft said i think it would be premature to 
meet at such a high level until we have a better indication of where 
mr arafat may be going 
abu dhabis staterun daily newspaper alittihad said sunday that 
egypt has extended an invitation to baker to visit the middle east 
to pave the way for an international peace conference 
quoting unidentified sources in cairo the newspaper said egypts 
intensive current efforts with washington are aimed at arranging a 
meeting between arafat and baker during that tour 
the saudi arabian newspaper almadina also quoted unnamed sources 
as saying consultations were under way to prepare an arafatbaker 
meeting in tunis in midfebruary 
the reagan administration broke a 13year ban on us talks with 
the plo last month secretary of state george p shultz said the 
decision was based on a public statement by arafat renouncing 
terrorism in all forms and accepting israels right to exist 
the state department revealed last week that a second more 
informal contact with the plo had been made in tunis on jan 17 
the department also released a partial transcript of a tape 
recording in which arafat vowed to shoot anyone who tried to stem 
palestinian unrest on the israeliheld west bank 
assistant secretary of state richard w murphy said last month 
that talks with the plo would be suspended if arafat reneged on his 
renunciation of terrorism 
on another issue scowcroft said suspected poison gas plants in 
libya and iraq pose a very serious problem but he declined to say 
whether the bush administration would endorse use of force to knock 
them out 
they are a terrible problem and it is a problem akin in its 
scope to that of nuclear proliferation because these weapons 
especially in city attacks antipopulation attacks can be every 
bit as devastating as nuclear weapons he said 
scowcroft noted that they are much harder to control because 
the plants to produce them are in many cases like pharmaceutical 
plants like insecticide plants 
he was questioned about whether it would be more serious to use 
force against such chemical weapons plants or to let them go into 
production 
sometimes one has to make a choice between undesirable 
alternatives scowcroft replied 
but he added im not about to make that choice now

the federal government will expand its role in 
investigating alleged insider trading and other fraud in the 
nations securities and commodities markets attorney general dick 
thornburgh said sunday 
thornburgh said the beefedup federal role would include new 
task forces established specifically to focus on fraud and insider 
dealing in both the securities and commodities markets 
thornburgh interviewed on the nbctv program meet the press 
declined to be specific about a current investigation of the worlds 
two largest futures exchanges the chicago board of trade and the 
chicago mercantile exchange but he indicated authorities were 
preparing to submit evidence to a grand jury 
obviously i cant discuss in detail whats a pending 
investigation thornburgh said i dont want to obviously make 
any predictions but the investigation is farreaching it is 
significant we will be gathering and submitting evidence to see 
if violations of the federal criminal laws have occurred 
asked when such a review might take place thornburgh said you 
can never put a timetable on that im afraid 
the fbi reportedly has been investigating alleged fraud by 
traders at the chicago exchanges for the past two years the 
investigation centers on allegations investors were cheated out of 
millions of dollars and reportedly has included the use of wiretaps 
to record conversations with traders suspected of fraud 
while avoiding specifics about the chicago case thornburgh 
promised an expanded federal role in such investigations 
well be announcing soon a much beefedup operation in this 
regard because its basically a proconsumer initiative 
thornburgh said people who trade on these markets are entitled to 
their integrity 
he was not specific about the composition or duties of the 
planned task forces or about when the announcement of their 
establishment would be made 
word of the chicago investigation surfaced the same week that the 
federal prosecutor widely associated with insidertrading 
investigations on wall street us attorney rudolph w giuliani 
announced he was resigning 
president bush will appoint a successor new york republican sen 
alfonse m damato has recommended criminal defense attorney otto 
obermaier despite objections from giuliani presidents 
traditionally accept the recommendation of the senior state senator 
from their party 
giulianis objections stem from obermaiers representation of 
several firms that are or have been targets of insidertrading 
investigations 
those are choices that are made by the president and they would 
be made only after careful scrutiny of the individuals 
qualifications to serve and carry out the presidents agenda 
thornburgh said when asked whether bush would accept damatos 
recommendation

the communist partys decision to reverse a 
sevenyear stand against solidarity offers the possibility of a 
compromise unprecedented in the history of the communist bloc 
for the first time communist leaders have offered to negotiate 
with an independent popular opposition movement on the structure of 
political and social freedoms affecting the entire society 
unlike 1980 talks with solidarity authorities now openly say 
they want to discuss ways to legalize opposition to the government 
and to institutionalize a parliamentary opposition that would 
transform the partydominated system 
the talks would cover trade unions solidaritys first goal 
but the subjects of other independent associations and clubs 
elections freedom of the press and constitutional changes also are 
expected at talks on polands future 
even the normally skeptical solidarity leader lech walesa seemed 
impressed and said he was surprised by the document on trade union 
and political freedoms issued after a tumultuous party central 
committee meeting last week 
it has never happened in the party before it will mean 
breaking the monopoly on power walesa said of the documents 
strong endorsement of economic political and social pluralism 
solidaritys national executive committee on sunday agreed the 
governments expression of willingness to legalize the trade union 
federation removed the last obstacle to talks with authorities a 
solidarity spokesman said the talks should start very soon 
but much skepticism remains in solidarity ranks based on past 
experience the union had a signed agreement with the government in 
august 1980 guaranteeing its right to exist but the accord proved 
meaningless when polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski called out 
his troops and interned thousands of solidarity members in a dec 
13 1981 crackdown 
now there are suspicions the government wants a new accord only 
to calm a huge wave of public unrest that appears to be building 
after yet another year of steep inflation and constant shortages 
polish living standards dropped sharply in the early 1980s and 
still have not climbed back to the level of a decade ago 
walesa warned in a television debate in november that poland is 
in danger of falling further and further behind the rest of europe 
he argues for labor calm because widespread strikes would harm 
the economy at the same time walesa stresses that the union must 
have the right to strike and says he will not sign any agreement at 
the cost of solidaritys independence 
a government source demanding anonymity said authorities are 
counting on solidarity to keep the peace and expressed confidence 
that if the union and authorities form a partnership they will keep 
factories calm and give planned economic reforms a chance to work 
janusz onyszkiewicz solidaritys national spokesman said sunday 
the union will not be pushed into the role of the police or a fire 
brigade to put out strikes 
but he added we want to discuss economic reform if it 
works then there will be no need to make a general strike 
the dramatic change of course by polish authorities can be 
explained in several ways 
in addition to the specter of strikes larger than the two waves 
of labor unrest that shocked authorities last year there has been a 
growing consensus encouraged by polands powerful roman catholic 
church that the country will never move forward without compromise 
between the government and opposition 
some credit must go to walesas performance on a nationwide 
television debate in november while coming out strongly for 
reinstating solidarity he convinced authorities he is a responsible 
leader not seeking to plunge poland into confrontation 
prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski said the governments 
polling data after the debate showed a significant increase in 
support for both the government and solidarity 
this was not paradoxical he said agreement could prove a 
popular and beneficial policy for both sides 
among rankandfile solidarity activists there is eagerness to 
get started again 
everyone is ready for it said andrzej durzynski a union 
member from solidaritys birthplace the lenin shipyard in gdansk 
it wont be necessary to create solidarity anew simply to 
reactivate it

in 1948 alfred c kinsey shocked and 
fascinated americans by telling them what was going on in their own 
bedrooms 
four decades later the hot topic at the now worldfamous kinsey 
institute has shifted from the bedroom to the boardroom 
june reinisch the sex research centers highprofile 
columnwriting director has been asked to resign 
officials at indiana university where the institution is located 
and which provides some of its funding last month called for her to 
step down saying she has managed the institute poorly and failed to 
conduct enough research in her 6 years there 
reinisch refuses to step down calling the charges groundless 
she also maintains that only the institutes 10member board of 
trustees on which she sits can tell her to resign the institution 
is incorporated separately from the university though five of the 
board members are university employees 
the institute does not just belong to indiana university 
reinisch said were a national and international institute we 
belong to the public 
reinisch and the university are stalemated with the board of 
trustees waiting for her to decide whether she will resign no 
deadline was given 
in the meantime reinisch said she is trying to conduct business 
as usual at the institute founded in 1947 by kinsey an indiana 
university zoologist who studied the gall wasp before turning his 
research to human sexuality 
there are no signs to let the public know the institute even 
exists on the university campus or that inside its walls are housed 
thousands of pieces of erotic art its library includes 75000 
volumes and sexuallyoriented material including cartoons stag 
films fetish objects condoms and prison art 
reinisch 45 continues to write her syndicated column the 
kinsey report which appears in newspapers nationwide and deals with 
topics ranging from sexual fantasy to menopause 
but reinisch also said she spends a large part of the day on the 
telephone discussing her situation with an attorney she has written 
a 100pageplus rebuttal to a university review committees critical 
report which led to the call for her resignation 
other developments have added to the chaos 
last fall the institutes three librarians left abruptly during 
a renovation of the library their departure forced the library to 
close it has not reopened 
following the review committees report the institutes former 
director paul gebhard severed ties with it and criticized library 
cutbacks made after the librarys parttime staff was replaced with 
the fulltime librarians 
frankly it pains me to see journal subscriptions cut and other 
austerity measures taken in the library while money is spent on 
carpets drapes brass lighting fixtures and similar 
nonessentials he said 
reinisch said the renovation money came from separate funds that 
she asked the university to set aside as a condition of her 
accepting the 79000ayear job not from research funds she came 
from rutgers university in new jersey where she was a psychology 
professor 
you cant have an internationally known center that looks like 
an attic she said 
a major fundraiser planned for february in los angeles by 
sherry hackett a trustee and wife of comedian buddy hackett was 
postponed because of the uncertainty over reinischs position 
exactly why some want to get rid of reinisch remains unclear 
aside from the complaints about her management style and research 
efforts 
said reinisch a lot of the discussions and a lot of the 
testimony most of it and a lot of the letters that the committee 
has collected all in fact have been done under the promise of 
confidentiality 
morton lowengrub dean of the college of arts and sciences and 
the official who called for her resignation has declined to comment 
a review two years before reinisch was hired found the institute 
in drastic need of reorganization the heraldtimes of 
bloomington reported a faculty committee found the institute must 
come closer to achieving its scholarly objectives to warrant 
continued university support and it recommended hiring a new 
director 
reinisch defends her work noting that she brought with her more 
than 800000 in research money and obtained a grant for more than 
700000 three years later she lists at least 15 publications since 
1982 of which she was the primary author 
reinisch contends kinsey who died in 1956 would be pleased by 
her leadership 
ive really thought of him all the time and tried to do the 
kinds of things that i thought he would do or that he would like to 
have done at this point because of course today is not 40 years 
ago she said

a top vatican official announced that pope 
john paul ii will retain a rule barring elderly cardinals from 
electing new popes a source said sunday the rule has reportedly 
caused dissension among cardinals 
the vatican source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
monsignor agnelo rossi dean of the college of cardinals said in a 
letter to the cardinals the pope is keeping the rule enacted by his 
predecessor paul vi 
the italian news agency ansa in a report on the letter said 
rossi noted at recent meetings of cardinals that there has been open 
criticism about the rule which bars cardinals 80 years and older 
from voting for new popes 
other news reports sunday said rossis announcement came in 
response to a letter to the pope signed by 10 cardinals asking for a 
change in the rule 
however several of the 10 cardinals named in the reports denied 
signing such a letter such a letter would be unusual since it would 
be a formal display of dissent at the top of the church hierarchy 
after the pontiff cardinals come next in the hierarchy of the 
roman catholic church there are currently 156 cardinals of whom 
119 are under 80 
in 1970 pope paul vi withdrew from cardinals 80 years or older 
the right to elect popes and hold vatican office he hoped to 
rejuvenate the roman curia the central offices of the catholic 
church and the secret conclaves of cardinals that elect the pope 
to replace a deceased one 
the change has been a source of criticism since by some cardinals 
the italian news agency adn kronos reported saturday that 10 
cardinals had signed a letter asking for a change in the law and 
the milan daily corriere della sera said it had confirmed the report 
however ansa on sunday said it contacted four of the cardinals 
named by the agency and they denied signing any such letter 
one of the four cited by ansa cardinal corrado bafile told the 
associated press he had not signed a letter about the age limit he 
said that the reports are not true at least on this point he 
would not elaborate 
cardinal silvio oddi was quoted as saying in sundays la 
repubblica newspaper that he didnt sign any such letter because 
no one asked me to but sincerely i would have signed it without 
hesitation 
he was further quoted as saying if a person is fully lucid and 
capable of reason why forbid him from voting

calls for a ban on private ownership of 
semiautomatic military weapons in california have risen strikingly 
since one was used in stockton in a schoolyard attack that killed 
five children 
the state attorney general and several lawmakers hope to pass 
legislation while californians are still stunned by the killings and 
the wounding of 29 other children and a teacher last week by a man 
firing an ak47 assault rifle 
these kinds of weapons are available to anyone who wants to buy 
them said attorney general john van de kamp all one needs is a 
warm smile and cold cash this is madness and this has to stop we 
have to ban these weapons from going in the streets of our city and 
state 
senate leader david roberti urged californians to write talk 
call on talk radio call their legislators demand scream 
pressure intimidate in favor of a ban 
at the request of san francisco mayor art agnos the us 
conference of mayors may take up a resolution calling for a ban on 
paramilitary weapons such as the sovietdesigned ak47 agnos 
himself was wounded by a gunman in one of san franciscos infamous 
zebra attacks 15 years ago 
the group agreed to have a subcommittee consider the resolution 
in february said agnos press secretary eileen maloney the 
resolution would only be advisory in nature 
if urban mayors and police chiefs across the country unite 
behind a grassroots demand that sale of assault weapons be halted 
i am convinced we can make our voices heard in the nations 
statehouses and the halls of congress agnos said 
the efforts are being met with vigorous opposition by staunch 
progun advocates such as hl richardson a national director of 
the national rifle association and founder of gun owners of 
california 
the real question is how a nut like that with his background 
can be walking around on the street why dont we go after the 
criminal for a change richardson said of the stockton gunman 
drifter patrick purdy who killed himself after the assault on the 
schoolyard 
purdy had both a criminal record and a history of mental 
problems he bought the ak47 at a gun shop in sandy ore in 
august all he had to do was fill out a form and pay for it no 
waiting period was required 
purdy could have bought the rifle in california as well under 
the law law anyone 18 years old or older with a drivers license 
can purchase a rifle there is no waiting period and nothing 
preventing felons or those with a history of mental problems from 
buying rifles 
richardson said he owns a semiautomatic weapon i use it for 
hunting turkey in texas he said it is also a very good varmint 
firearm very accurate 
gov george deukmejian asked if he would support a ban on the 
weapons if passed by the legislature said he would first want to 
review the whole issue very carefully 
but i just for the life of me cannot see why anybody who is 
going to use a gun just for sporting purposes would want or need to 
have a military assault type weapon he added 
deukmejian said he would support a requirement that rifle and 
shotgun buyers wait 15 days for a background check before obtaining 
one of the weapons the state currently has such a delay on the sale 
of handguns 
i dont think that anybody who has got a known record in terms 
of criminal activity or somebody who has had mental problems i 
dont have any problem with preventing those individuals from 
getting possession of any gun deukmejian said 
the attorney generals proposed legislation will offer a 
definition of a semiautomatic assault weapon and specify some 
brands all of which would be banned said dick iglehart alameda 
countys chief assistant district attorney and a member of a task 
force created by van de kamp to address the problem 
but assembly speaker willie brown said he was not terribly 
optimistic that lawmakers will do anything about gun control 
every day that we move away from the stocktontype incident 
the legislative will to do something in that area will be reduced 
brown said

officials plan to investigate police actions 
during a white supremacist march that drew bricks and bottles from 
angry counterdemonstrators but the citys top policeman believes 
there were no major problems 
the city response to saturdays march by a handful of nationalist 
movement followers was as good as we could make it said george 
napper atlantas commissioner of public safety 
but he said some allegations would be looked into including 
reports of officers clubbing and arresting uninvolved spectators 
while trying to control the angry crowds 
obviously there were some incidents but i thought by and 
large we avoided anything major this city has a legacy to work 
things out i think thats why we havent had the kind of 
situations that took place in miami he said referring to last 
weeks riots there 
police reported 42 arrests in the confrontation between the 
halfdozen white supremacist marchers and the hundreds of 
counterdemonstrators hospital officials said they treated 13 
people including police officers members of the georgia army 
national guard and counterdemonstrators for minor injuries 
atlanta was quiet sunday parts of the march route were still 
littered with bricks boards broken bottles rocks and chunks of 
concrete hurled at the marchers and the police and national guard 
members protecting them 
in all an estimated 2000 national guard members and state and 
local police were mobilized in what appeared at first to be a 
striking case of overkill 
but atlanta which is heavily black houses several colleges and 
universities and has a sizable counterculture community all 
potential sources of participants for countering a white supremacist 
march 
counterdemonstrators and bystanders estimated at between 1000 
and 3000 overwhelmed police lines along parts of the route 
charged toward the marchers and hurled objects 
the city invited this kind of thing by issuing the white 
supremacists a march permit charged dianne mathiowetz a member of 
the ad hoc committee against the klan 
michele allen another counterdemonstrator said the 
rockthrowers are just as bad as the klan people have to stand up 
to the klan but there has to be some peaceful way this is a war 
zone 
mississippi lawyer richard barrett who heads the nationalist 
movement and his handful of followers sang and shouted antimartin 
luther king slogans along the route of about two miles 
barrett attempted the march on the eve of last julys democratic 
national convention but the city canceled his permit when hundreds 
of counterdemonstrators massed at the capitol and police feared 
violence 
he said saturdays march was a restaging of the earlier effort as 
well as a repudiation of king whom he called a tyrant and a sexual 
pervert and of the national holiday honoring the slain civil rights 
leader 
barrett declined to say if he would try to march again in 
atlanta i have just begun to fight he said 
after the march napper went to five points atlantas central 
downtown intersection where at least 1000 mostly black youths 
remained assembled watched by scores of police on horseback or in 
riot control gear 
napper who like most of atlantas top law enforcement officials 
is black was pelted with questions and insults asking why barretts 
group was allowed to march and was given protection 
you protect the klan but you wont protect us you aint my 
commissioner one woman screamed youre protecting people who 
will lynch my grandchildren yelled another 
napper who broke out of the crowd with police help said they 
are entitled to protection its not always easy

a meeting of more than 900 people sunday nominated 
andrei d sakharov for a seat on the new congress of peoples 
deputies representing moscow an activist said 
the nomination puts the human rights activist physicist and 
nobel peace prize winner on an electoral collision course with 
former moscow communist party leader boris yeltsin and a powerful 
politburo member 
it also gives him two nominations in the upcoming elections one 
as a candidate representing moscows oktyabr district which was 
made last week and one as a candidate for the entire capital 
sundays nomination came at a meeting organized by the memorial 
group said yuri mityunov memorial is a group formed in memory of 
victims of dictator josef stalin 
mityunov a participant in the meeting at the house of filmmakers 
on moscows north side said a member of moscows election 
commission informed the meeting three other candidates so far had 
been nominated for the same seat 
they include yeltsin the stillpopular former moscow party boss 
who was sacked by president mikhail s gorbachev in november 1987 
because of his management style and vitaly i vorotnikov the 
president of the russian republic and a full member of the communist 
party politburo 
about 500 people pressed outside the filmmakers building unable 
to get into the 3hour meeting that was hastily organized by 
memorial on friday said mityunov a member of the meetings 
accounting commission 
mityunov said 970 people raised pink cards to nominate sakharov 
unanimously and that he accepted 
memorial is not officially recognized and thus does not have the 
right to nominate candidates but the meeting was of a group of 
moscow voters rather than a meeting of memorial 
the congress of peoples deputies will consist of 2250 members 
twothirds elected on the basis of geographical districts and 
onethird from communist party trade union professional and social 
organizations it will choose more than 400 of its members to form a 
new more active supreme soviet parliament 
sakharov 67 appeared at sundays meeting to read a platform he 
originally presented to his institute colleagues friday and to 
answer questions mityunov said his platform calls for release of 
all prisoners of conscience freedom of association more military 
cutbacks and economic reforms 
sakharov was rejected as a candidate by the prestigious academy 
of sciences last week causing an angry protest by his coworkers at 
the lebedev institute of physics they then nominated him as a 
candidate from moscows oktyabr district 
if elected from the oktyabr region sakharov would hold one of 24 
seats from moscow if elected to the supreme soviet he would be a 
member of the soviet of the union the house in the supreme soviet 
whose representatives are elected on the basis of geographical 
districts 
if elected on the basis of the nomination sunday sakharov would 
represent all of moscow and be a member of the soviet of 
nationalities in the supreme soviet which will provide 
representation in the highest legislative body for all of the more 
than 100 ethnic groups that make up the soviet union 
sakharovs nomination now goes to an electoral commission that 
will select the candidates to actually be placed before voters march 
26 it could put forward all of those nominated but it also could 
reduce the number to only one no date has been set for its meeting

authorities suspect a west german 
company shipped equipment to iraq that could be used to make 
chemical weapons a prosecutor said sunday 
darmstadt prosecutor thomas brand said documents seized from 
offices of the preussag company of hanover indicate it shipped 
containers and other equipment to iraq that with relative 
certainty could have been used in the production of chemical 
weapons brand spoke in an interview broadcast by hamburgbased 
spiegel tv network 
it is not against west german law to ship iraq industrial goods 
the legal issue is whether the company knew the consignments would 
be used to produce chemical weapons 
the documents some seized in 1987 also indicate the company 
delivered specialized equipment to iraq that could be used to 
produce poison gas shells and bombs he said 
no charges have been filed brand said 
preussags administrative offices in hanover and darmstadt were 
closed sunday and company officials could not be reached for 
comment 
brands office is investigating three other west german companies 
in connection with sales to iraq the prosecutor has jurisdiction in 
the case because preussag owns a subsidiary near southern darmstadt 
brand last week named two of the companies karl kolb gmbh and 
co and the nowdefunct pilot plant company he refused to name the 
third company under investigation 
brand said his allegations are based on preliminary 
evaluations and investigations are continuing to determine whether 
export laws have been broken 
investigators are focusing on a west german law that requires an 
export license to ship arms hazardous substances or components that 
can be used to produce them in addition a wideranging law forbids 
such exports to areas of conflict 
other news reports have linked west german technicians and 
scientists to production of biological weapons in iraq 
the west german government has said it has indications such a 
plant may operate in iraq but no evidence of german participation 
brands comments came as controversy continued over alleged 
involvement by west german companies in such sales to iraq and libya 
at least two west german companies are under criminal 
investigation in connection with a suspected libyan chemical weapons 
factory and investigators are investigating a munichbased company 
suspected of helping libya develop the capability to refuel 
warplanes in flight 
us officials contend the libyan factory in rabta south of 
tripoli is designed to produce poison gas libya says the facility 
will manufacture pharmaceuticals 
the los angeles times reported sunday that us officials 
received a crucial clue about the rabta plants operations after the 
deaths of wild dogs in the libyan desert 
the newspaper said a toxic spill of chemical wastes at the site 
last august apparently killed the dogs and that panicked libyans 
breached security by using international phone lines to call a 
german firm helping them build the plant 
allegations that west german companies were involved in the 
middle east sales and the libyan plant have stunned and embarrassed 
the west german government and dominated news media here for three 
weeks 
on sunday the hamburgbased bild am sonntag newspaper reported 
that government officials furious over the way the investigation 
has been handled are demanding the resignation of west germanys 
intelligence chief 
chief government spokesman friedhelm ost called the report pure 
speculation

burglars had struck dave pastoreks gas 
station twice in three days making off with a total of more than 
3000 
then on friday a big manila envelope arrived in the mail and 
pastorek figured it was more bad news maybe from his lawyer or 
accountant 
inside a note read 
i am sorry 
i drank too much and broke into your station on a dare 
i am sorry 
along with the note he found 167 in cash and checks and credit 
card receipts worth about 1600 everything that had been stolen 
from the station one week earlier 
i about died said pastorek 30 we figure his conscience 
was bothering him and he probably wasnt able to sleep for four or 
five nights 
now he said hes waiting for the burglar who hit jan 16 to get 
a case of the guilts that one got away with about 1400 in 
receipts 
if the first guy did it on a dare im wondering if maybe the 
second guy was the one who dared him maybe after he saw it could be 
done he decided to try it himself pastorek said 
coincidentally the city kicked off an honesty campaign last 
week directed by the columbus commission on ethics and values 
the head of the commission is jeb stuart magruder a watergate 
conspirator who is now a presbyterian minister

a russian orthodox church leader is nominated in a 
country where believers long have been repressed leading reformers 
are not chosen to carry out major reforms a faithful worker starts 
a protest hunger strike 
this is the bewildering world of soviet campaigning one third of 
the way into the race for march 26 elections 
it has raised questions about how much democracy there is in the 
new political system of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and 
it mirrors the complex processes going on in his country 
i believe a more democratic mechanism of nominating candidates 
is needed said nobel peace prize winner andrei d sakharov whose 
candidacy was rejected by the academy of sciences and who now finds 
himself in the middle of one of the biggest disputes 
sakharov and thousands of others have been nominated at meetings 
of the communist party trade unions professional organizations and 
residents of geographical areas for seats in the 2250member 
congress of peoples deputies 
the congress will meet annually and will choose the soviet 
president and members of a new smaller and more active supreme 
soviet 
promoting the new system gorbachev said in december that 
political reforms are essential it is only by combining economic 
reform with political changes democratization and glasnost 
openness that we can fulfill both the immediate and longterm 
tasks we have set ourselves he said stronger local and national 
legislatures are essential gorbachev said 
one third of the deputies are being chosen not on the traditional 
basis of geographic districts but from the party unions 
professional organizations and other officially recognized groups 
issues espoused by those attending nominating meetings have 
affected the outcome 
the tass news agency reported that metropolitan alexei whose 
russian orthodox diocese includes leningrad and estonia has been 
nominated by workers of an agricultural complex because of his 
concern over ecological issues the law specifically allows clerical 
candidates though there are promises of reform soviet churches 
still are under stalinera laws that require they be registered and 
prevent them from organizing religious education or charity 
the communist party newspaper pravda reported sunday that the 
central council of trade unions refused to endorse reformist 
economist tatyana zaslavskaya because of her call for price 
increases to right the economy it did endorse its chairman stepan 
shalaev who called for more vacation time 
others besides sakharov question whether the system is 
democratic and its complexity is causing a scramble for nominations 
in a country where voting has been little more than the ritual of 
electing a slate approved by authorities 
candidates may not espouse views contrary to the constitution 
which enshrines the communist party as the leading and guiding force 
of soviet society 
rankandfile party members nominated 31500 candidates for 100 
seats but on jan 10 the policymaking central committee 
recommended 100 of them and the ruling politburo put them on the 
ballot ensuring that although a multitude of voices were heard 
early in the process there will be no choices to make on election 
day 
sakharovs colleagues at the lebedev institute of physics 
complained bitterly last week when the 67yearold dean of the 
soviet human rights movement and other leading proponents of reform 
were passed over for nomination by the academy of sciences 
at the academy as well as other organizations and electoral 
districts nominations must be winnowed by an official electoral 
commission 
a group of several hundred people at sakharovs institute 
unanimously complained the academys electoral commission was 
elitist formed only from highranking members who selected others 
of similar rank that left out sakharov and others like space 
scientist roald sagdeev and economists gavril popov and nikolai 
shmelev 
the complexity of the electoral process allowed sakharovs 
supporters to nominate him from a geographical district instead and 
they said more nominations were expected to increase his chances of 
being on the final ballot elsewhere the complexity allowed 
reformist writers ales adamovich and yegor yakovlev to be nominated 
by the filmmakers union rather than the writers union which is 
split by bitter differences between liberals and conservatives 
in leningrad tass said 55yearold factory worker gennady 
bogomolov declared a monthlong hunger strike friday because the 
committee at his factory refused to hold a meeting to nominate him 
bogomolov a winner of the governments state prize said party 
officials pressured the workers council not to nominate him because 
of longstanding differences over pay and restructuring the economy 
tass said 
the newspaper komsomolskaya pravda displayed on its front page 
friday the text of a telegram saying two scientists and a journalist 
had gone on a hunger strike in stavropol a city where gorbachev 
once served as communist party chief because city officials refused 
to allow them to organize a local nominating meeting

former president reagan and his wife nancy 
settling with apparent ease into their new life at 668 saint cloud 
road returned to an unusual standing ovation sunday at the church 
where they worshiped before entering the white house 
god has answered our prayers for you and for mrs reagan 
and i want you to know we are very pleased to welcome you back and 
thank god for what you were able to do for your country in these 
last eight years the rev donn moomaw of bel air presbyterian 
church told reagan 
the congregation disregarding a precautionary note in the church 
bulletin against applauding during the service stood and gave the 
reagans a prolonged round of handclapping 
we probably wont be doing that every sunday you come moomaw 
said 
the reagans seated near the back of the hilltop church later 
took part in the presbyterian communion service in which wafers and 
grape juice are brought to the worshipers at their seats and joined 
in the singing of amazing grace 
moomaw preached on a text from ephesians 2 reading in the 
translation he used it is by grace that you have been saved 
through faith and not from yourselves it is the gift of god not by 
works so that no one can boast 
wellwishers lined a rope line outside the church as the reagans 
entered and left the church people said nice to have you back 
and welcome home and he looks so good 
the reagans were greeted on arrival by frank mcdougall a deacon 
and 20year member of the church who oversees parking and by carl 
vann the head usher with a white carnation in his lapel 
the reagans moved here friday from the white house after he 
completed an eightyear assignment in washington as president of the 
united states 
clusters of red white and blue balloons and a welcome ron and 
nancy sign remained up at one nearby house over the weekend but 
otherwise the reagans new street looked like your average 
neighborhood of multimillion dollar residences 
will he make a change jeffrey hyland a real estate 
executive who lives near the reagans repeated the question to 
himself before answering maybe for a couple of weeks he said 
after that i think everything will be back to normal 
small knots of tourists gathered along the narrow winding street 
from time to time over the weekend hoping to catch a glimpse of the 
former president and first lady 
the reagans son ron drove up in a red sports car and visited 
for about half an hour while he was there he and his parents 
appeared on a walkway that is visible from the road and waved 
occasionally tour vans stopped in front of the reagans place 
a new stop on an established route that includes the homes of 
neighbors zsa zsa gabor and elizabeth taylor 
flowers were delivered for mrs reagan a secret service man came 
outside the walls for a moment 
but the elaborate security that was in effect when reagan visited 
here as president over the christmas and new years holidays was 
gone no longer was the street blocked off at both ends and security 
cars parked along its length 
the reagans continue to receive aroundtheclock secret service 
protection 
we wont give you the specifics of what they are going to get 
how much said secret service spokesman rich adams in washington 
it would really be kind of selfdefeating for us to do that 
hyland the new neighbor estimated security had been scaled back 
by 80 percent 
the reagans will continue to be driven by the secret service 
there was a 10car caravan when they arrived friday after the flight 
from washington 
they come and go and are in and out of the driveway in 10 
seconds and down the street said hyland i dont think its 
going to be much of a problem 
like all the streets in the fashionable hillside neighborhood 
called belair saint cloud has no sidewalks apparently part of an 
effort to protect its exclusivity when it was first laid out as a 
haven for blue bloods in the 1920s 
in a television interview broadcast on the cbs program 60 
minutes on jan l5 mrs reagan looking ahead to life after the 
white house said not being on the front pages would be fine with 
me 
i will not miss being under the microscope mrs reagan said 
indeed attention is already shifting to president bush and his 
wife barbara as they get settled in at 1600 pennsylvania avenue and 
away from the reagans as they get settled in on saint cloud road 
we have our share of rubberneckers but we have always had 
them said hyland the novelty i think is going to very 
quickly wear off 
as for the reagans they said during the flight from washington 
that they still have unpacking to do 
up to now ive been doing that the former first lady told 
reporters asked whether the president was good at unpacking she 
just laughed

prime minister rajiv gandhis congress party 
appeared headed for a setback sunday in a state election seen as a 
barometer for national races later this year 
the congress party was not expected to win the legislative 
contest in the southern state of tamil nadu but a respectable 
showing against the strong regional parties would have bolstered the 
gandhi partys national image 
the voting trend shows a major setback for gandhi he will 
have to accept most of the blame said the states top political 
analyst cho ramaswamy 
the frontrunner for the tamil nadu state assembly seats was the 
dravida munnetra kazhagam party or dravidian progressive front 
headed by screenwriter and politician muthuvel karunanidhi 
with more than half the ballots from saturdays election counted 
karunanidhis party or its allies led in 151 of the 232 
constituencies the government election control room reported 
the state assembly has 234 seats but elections in two districts 
were postponed due to the deaths of candidates 
the congress party was ahead in 35 districts 
gandhi must call a national parliamentary election before the end 
of the year the races will decide which party governs india for the 
next five years 
a surprise victory could have encouraged gandhi to call early 
national elections before the various opposition groups join 
together in sufficient strength to unseat congress 
the results will have an effect on national politics said 
ramaswamy 
state elections also were conducted saturday in the northeastern 
states of nagaland and mizoram but results were expected to come in 
more slowly than those in tamil nadu 
the other two groups in tamil nadu to make a showing were rival 
factions of a party splintered between the wife and the leading lady 
of late movie starpolitician mg ramachandran 
former movie actress jayalalitha jayarams faction of the 
allindia anna dravida munnestra kazhagam party led in 37 districts 
ms jayaram 42 was a longtime close companion of ramachandran and 
played opposite him in many movies 
his widow 64yearold janaki ramachandran also an exactress 
heads a party faction that was leading in four districts 
independents led in eight districts cold weather delayed 
tallying in two other districts 
gandhis most visible national political foe vp singh had 
backed karunanidhi 
singh served as gandhis finance and defense minister before he 
was expelled for conducting tax raids on government officials and 
inquiries into foreign arms deals he is trying to unite the janata 
dal a loose coalition of three north indian parties to muster 
enough strength to challenge gandhi in national elections 
vp singh will project the dmks victory as his own 
ramaswamy said referring to the dravida munnestra kazhagam party 
singh was not immediately available for comment 
united news of india said counting would not begin until monday 
in mizoram state where some ballot boxes in remote villages had to 
be collected by helicopters 
gandhi campaigned extensively for his party in the three states 
where elections were held saturday in all three strong local 
parties traditionally triumph over the congress 
most of the national attention centered on tamil nadu where 36 
million people were eligible to vote the voter turnout was about 69 
percent election officials said 
turnouts were higher in the less populous northeastern states 
united news said 80 to 85 percent of the 300000 eligible voters 
showed up in mizoram where a 40member state assembly was being 
elected 
election officials estimated that 75 percent of nagalands 
600000 eligible voters turned out to choose the 60member state 
assembly

in the 11 years since he last worked in the 
white house brent scowcroft has not minced words about his views on 
strategic policies to the point of openly criticizing the reagan 
administration on occasion 
now in his opening days as president bushs national security 
adviser scowcroft is shying away from discussing how his personal 
views might translate into bush administration policy 
the secretary of state should be the chief spokesman for the 
presidents foreign policy and the president makes foreign 
policy scowcroft smiling said in an interview with the 
associated press the national security adviser should be not 
exactly invisible but certainly not in the spotlight 
reticence aside scowcrofts influence promises to be as great as 
his experience bush and scowcroft worked closely once before when 
bush was cia director in 1976 and scowcroft was national security 
adviser to president ford 
scowcroft 63 said he has gained a sense of perspective since he 
began his first job at the white house as military aide to henry 
kissinger on the national security council staff in 1972 he rose 
quickly from the rank of air force colonel to threestar general 
and to national security adviser 197577 after ford replaced richard 
nixon and kissinger became secretary of state 
ive probably written and said more about the organization and 
the function of the nsc system than scowcroft said pausing 
anyone in the country 
he has a daunting assignment this time around to direct a 
complete review of us strategic interests an assessment that many 
arms control experts predict will change the american negotiating 
position toward the soviets and in the pentagon budget that reagan 
sent to capitol hill earlier this month 
the task seems to rest lightly on scowcrofts thin shoulders he 
is balding and slight five feet eight inches tall and weighs 130 
pounds probably a little less than i did at west point because i 
had more muscle then 
he keeps trim by jogging about three miles a night after 
watching abcs nightline late night interview show 
born in ogden utah he counts the mormon church and his father 
as the significant early influences in his life 
there is a notion among the mormons that at the end of each day 
you ought to be able to say ive made myself a better person or i 
have made things better by what i have done today said scowcroft 
but he said i am not a strict mormon i frequently have a 
glass of wine with dinner and i enjoy coffee i like to work at 
night said scowcroft who has disciplined himself to work on four 
hours of sleep a night 
every once in a while i crash and when i operate this way i 
fall asleep at the drop of a hat he said 
i learned to do that from henry kissinger who does not require 
much sleep especially on trips we used to take about 1 oclock 
in the morning he would issue to the staff a whole bunch of things 
he wanted done by the next morning then he would go to bed and get 
up at 530 and expect to have them done said scowcroft with a 
hearty laugh 
scowcroft lives in a modest brick home in bethesda with marian 
his wife of 37 years their daughter karen works as an attorney in 
new york 
since leaving the white house and retiring from the military 
scowcroft has worked in the washington office of kissingers 
international consulting firm and has served as a member of the 
commission that investigated the irancontra affair and chairman of 
a presidential panel on strategic missile basing 
the basing panel known as the scowcroft commission charted some 
policies that are sharply at odds with those of the reagan 
administration scowcroft has come out strongly in favor of a 
singlewarhead mobile missile known as the midgetman 
and he ridiculed the administration for proposing at the moscow 
summit a system to base 10warhead mx missiles on rail lines on 
small bases in the southwest a plan he said in an oped piece last 
year would make them sitting ducks 
none of these ideas he has written make sense under a proposed 
strategic arms limitation treaty that would limit the number of both 
warheads and delivery vehicles such as missles and bombers 
such a regime scowcroft has written argues for singlewarhead 
mobile missiles dispersed over a large area such as the midgetman 
however reagan in his last budget proposal killed funding for 
the midgetman in favor of the 10warhead mx missile which would be 
deployed on rail cars on large bases in the southwest 
scowcroft declines to say publicly what he recommended to bush on 
such issues bush for his part said during the campaign that he 
liked both the mx and the midgetman although budget constraints 
argue against deploying both 
scowcroft prefers to discuss his vision of a white house security 
adviser with the leisure to try to do some longrange planning to 
sort of look out ahead to hypothesize the kind of world that we 
would like to see and then to look at the kind of forces that are 
at work for or against that kind of world 
and i think that where we want to go has an importance that it 
really hasnt had for much of the 40 years of the cold war and that 
is a lot of the old truths cold war relations with the allies 
economic relations all those things are changing now he said 
we are no longer just trying to frantically hold the line in 
europe for example to europe not an incitement to aggression by 
the soviet union he said 
the world has changed vastly since scowcroft was 12 and read a 
book called west point today 
i fell in love with west point not with the military as such 
i didnt go because i wanted to spend 30 years in the 
military said scowcroft who spent 29 years in uniform 
after graduating from west point in 1947 scowcroft joined the 
newly created air force and flew fighters until he crashed in a p51 
mustang 
i would rather call it a forced landing he said with a 
laugh a crash sounds totally uncontrolled 
the forced landing crushed three vertebrae and he spent two 
years in a hospital recuperating and missing the korean war 
denied the opportunity to fly in combat scowcroft switched 
tracks earning masters and doctoral degrees from columbia 
university teaching russian history at west point learning 
serbocroatian and serving as deputy air attache at the us 
embassy in yugoslavia 195961 
reflecting on his years in uniform and at the white house 
scowcroft says he would like to be remembered by the epitaph he 
served with distinction

the effort to reintroduce to the wild an 
animal that survived only in captivity is expanding with the 
introduction of a pair of red wolves to an island in the gulf of 
mexico 
its exciting to know that some are running free at last 
said david robinette the curator of mammals at the audubon zoo here 
the red wolf smaller and more elusive than its gray cousin once 
roamed the bottomlands of the south from the carolinas to texas 
about 100 survive in captivity the last few wild purebred red 
wolves were captured by the us fish and wildlife service in the 
late 1970s for captive breeding at the point defiance zoo in tacoma 
wash 
a few days ago a pair was released at horn island a wilderness 
area off the coast of mississippi the male was from audubon and the 
female of the pair was raised at point defiance 
since september 1987 four pairs of wolves raised at tacoma have 
been released in the alligator river refuge in coastal north 
carolina at least two cubs were spotted last summer 
a second group of red wolves was reintroduced to the wild on 
bulls island sc officials said 
in addition to wolves raised at tacoma the audubon zoo has added 
nine pups to the population and a female and four cubs were sent to 
the tacoma program over the weekend 
wildlife officials hope the pair on horn island now becoming 
acclimated in a sprawling penned area will breed in february or 
early march and produce a litter in april 
the hope is to release them and let them raise the pups as free 
from human contact as possible lewis greene the audubon zoos 
assistant curator of the red wolf exhibit said our wolves have 
retained some hunting instincts theyll go after squirrels or birds 
that go in their pen but for the wolves to live in the wild they 
have to be total hunters 
horn island was selected as the breeding site because it provides 
plenty of prey 
its wonderful to have them in exhibits but to maintain the 
species the way it should be there has to be natural selection they 
have to live in the wild robinette said

theodore robert ted bundy scheduled to 
die tuesday in the electric chair has been depicted as a diabolical 
genius a handsome and charming figure who like the plague 
brought death wherever he went 
the 42yearold former law student awaits execution for the 1978 
murder of kimberly diane leach a 12yearold from lake city 
bundy also faces execution for clubbing to death two young women 
at a sorority house in tallahassee three weeks before miss leach 
disappeared from a schoolyard he has been called a suspect in the 
deaths of as many as 36 women 
bundys attorney james coleman was asked recently why the 
public was fascinated with his client hes intelligent 
attractive hes your nextdoor neighbor hes one of us coleman 
said 
but at a clemency hearing in 1985 for bundy in the sorority 
slayings assistant state attorney jack poitinger said bundy is 
like the plague everywhere he goes death follows 
state attorney jerry blair who prosecuted bundy for the leach 
killing said he sees two reasons for the public fascination and 
revulsion with bundy 
the mere fact that he is a mass murderer a serial murderer 
gives rise to a certain degree of notoriety blair said the 
other reason is the persona of ted bundy ted bundy does not fit our 
stereotypical concept of what a criminal ought to be and what a mass 
murderer in particular ought to be 
bundy is very handsome he is bright hes articulate hes 
trained in the legal system he is all those things that we assume a 
mass murderer is not his very persona contributes to the publics 
fascination with the case 
us district judge g kendall sharp in 1987 called him a 
diabolical genius and said he was probably the most competent 
serial killer in the country at this time 
bundy has been the subject of five books and a tv miniseries 
the deliberate stranger which starred mark harmon 
bundy has been linked to eight slayings in washington state in 
1974 that became known as the ted murders because witnesses 
reported seeing a charming young stranger who called himself ted 
near where the victims disappeared 
in interviews with authorities over the weekend bundy is said to 
have confessed to those slayings as well as others 
bundy became one of the nations mostwanted fugitives after he 
twice escaped custody in colorado where he was being held on 
charges of murdering a nurse 
at the time the fbi said bundy was sought for questioning in 36 
slayings of young women he was captured in pensacola in 1978 
bundy was believed to have stalked young women near college 
campuses shopping centers and parks targeting victims with long 
dark hair parted in the middle 
prosecutors said he lured victims into his car by posing as a 
police officer or by making false requests for aid sometimes using 
crutches as a prop 
bundy also became known as an escape artist who could easily 
change his appearance and blend into a community 
he was caught in 1984 in an escape attempt from death row at 
florida state prison the states most heavily guarded penitentiary 
he was found with two hacksaw blades under his mattress and had 
already cut through one of the cell bars 
bundy was born theodore r cowell on nov 24 1946 in 
burlington vt to a department store clerk louise cowell at a 
home for unwed mothers his father was described by his mother as a 
bigtalking sailor home from the war 
when bundy was 4 he and his mother moved to tacoma wash where 
she met john culpepper bundy at a methodist church social they were 
married and john bundy went to work as a cook at the veterans 
administration hospital 
bundy was a good student but not brillant he was described as 
boisterous and prone to fights on the playground and shy and 
awkward in the classroom 
he was a boy scout and vice president of his church youth group 
he became active in the state republican party and received a 
glowing letter of recommendation to the university of utah law 
school from thenwashington gov dan evans 
police said that as a young man bundy began shoplifting things 
the family was too poor to buy and was once caught trying to steal a 
car authorities also said he was obsessed with pornography 
after his arrest in pensacola bundy told a detective 
pornography is one persons pleasure another persons vice or 
downfall

former ku klux klansman david duke said his 
top finish in a primary election for state representative signals 
renewed voter interest in white supremacy 
duke former imperial wizard of the knights of the ku klux klan 
led a field of seven candidates in saturdays primary election for a 
vacant state house seat representing a suburban district that is 99 
percent white duke received 33 percent of the vote and will face 
secondplace finisher john treen in a feb 18 runoff treen had 19 
percent of the vote 
i think the people knew that by my past involvement with the 
klan people know that i say what i really believe duke said 
after saturdays vote the klan is far behind me but the effort 
for equal rights for everybody is ahead of me 
i think when i win this race youll find candidates across the 
state and across the country begin to talk about the issues im 
raising i think this is the beginning of a change in this country 
duke left the klan in 1980 after being accused of trying to sell 
topsecret membership lists and set up the national association for 
the advancement of white people he calls himself a white civil 
rights worker 
louisianas open primary system places all candidates on the same 
ballot regardless of party affiliation if none receives a 
majority there is a runoff election between the top two 
votegetters 
saturdays vote in jefferson parish represented a 54 percent 
turnout of registered voters 
duke 38 ran as a republican with a campaign platform including 
proposed welfare revisions aimed at reducing black births he said 
saturday that he fully expected the platform to carry him into the 
legislature in february 
i think most people know i am trying to help them he said 
i think those racial issues are hurting our communitys economy

the cabinet on sunday debated a policy that 
gives troops greater freedom to shoot at palestinian protesters and 
both palestinians and israelis rejected a new peace plan for the 
occupied lands 
in the occupied territories most shopkeepers closed stores to 
observe a strike called by the moslem fundamentalist hamas movement 
and the army imposed curfews that confined about 180000 arabs to 
their homes in several gaza strip refugee camps 
arab news reports said six palestinian protesters were shot and 
wounded in clashes with soldiers in the occupied gaza strip and west 
bank the army could not confirm the casualties but reported two 
other woundings 
at the weekly cabinet meeting energy minister moshe shahal of 
the centerleft labor party criticized the defense ministrys 
decision to liberalize orders for opening fire on palestinian 
protesters 
the new rules allow officers and soldiers with special training 
to shoot plastic bullets at arabs who throw stones and set up 
roadblocks previously only officers were allowed to fire the 
plastic bullets and only in lifethreatening situations 
i think the issue is worth checking shahal told israel radio 
before the cabinet meeting adding that the new orders were 
possibly illegal 
defense minister yitzhak rabin also of labor and other 
ministers lashed out at shahals criticism the radio said 
we have an emergency situation and have to do everything 
possible to quell the riots cabinet minister ehud olmert of the 
rightwing likud bloc said on israel radio 
israel radio said justice ministry lawyers planned to discuss the 
issue with military attorneys later this week 
speaking on israel television after the cabinet meeting labor 
leader and finance minister shimon peres defended the use of plastic 
bullets which have been blamed for at least 40 deaths 
why do we use plastic bullets not because it gives us great 
pleasure but because regular bullets cause more deaths he said 
at least 367 palestinians and 15 israelis have died in the 
uprising that began dec 8 1987 
the association for civil rights in israel has appealed to the 
supreme court to review and examine the use of plastic bullets 
israels army radio said 
according to the independent hadashot newspaper the army is 
about to introduce a new type of rubber bullet more effective in 
dispersing crowds but incapable of penetrating the skin a military 
spokesman refused comment 
meanwhile both palestinians and israelis rejected an unofficial 
peace proposal put forth thursday by rabin who offered free 
elections in the territories in exchange for a ceasefire in the 
uprising peace talks and eventually a confederation between the 
occupied lands and israel or jordan 
bethelehems palestinian mayor elias freij told israel radio the 
plan will lead nowhere 
the palestine liberation organization rejected rabins plan 
friday 
the leftist peace now movement said the proposal could be viewed 
as serious only if accompanied by cancellation of harsh army 
policies and the release of detained arab leaders 
within rabins own leftleaning labor communications minister 
gad yaacobi said that he accepts the plan just as an interim 
stage not as a final settlement 
french foreign minister roland dumas on a twoday visit called 
for direct negotiations with palestinians to ensure peace 
stability and security in the region 
peace can only come about only via direct negotiations between 
the parties directly involved and that means mutual reciprocal 
recognition dumas said after meetings with president chaim 
herzog prime minister yitzhak shamir and peres 
in the gaza strip assailants presumed to be palestinians hurled 
two firebombs at a bus full of arab workers breaking a general 
strike by reporting to jobs in israel the workers fled the burning 
bus and no one was injured an arab reporter said

palestinians to prison terms of at least 20 years for attacks on

christian lacroix drifted into spring and summer on 
a soft pastel cloud sometimes bursting open with color at sundays 
opening of french haute couture collections 
femininity and the unexepected already prevail in paris where 
italys favorite fashion son valentino will ensure the surprise 
ending this year abandoning rome at least this season he will cap 
the week of french collections on thursday with his first haute 
couture showing in paris 
the move which has unsettled roman fashion lords serves to 
confirm the preeminence of french haute couture which can set 
trends for the entire fashion industry 
romance sometimes smoldering is clearly the word for summer 
from paris and chiffon or crepe is the language of love even in 
pants sexy sheaths make sure the romance is enticing 
hem lengths traveled from the floor to above the knee with no 
minis yet in sight exaggerated shoulders also disappeared 
gold was the prevailing accent from buttons to loafers at 
lacroix along with ruffles and widebrimmed hats 
torrente opening the season used chiffon dramatically in 
capes trains or simply as long scarves carressing the neck 
sailor themes cropped up as a counterpoint to softness with 
clean marine lines in navy or black and white 
leaving provencal behind for exotic saharan climes lacroix 
draped reams of chiffon in flowing pantsskirts reminiscent of a 
gust of sand embroidered and bejeweled raw silk used lace almost 
relentlessly and gathered organza into sumptuous mountains 
his palette was above all the beigetones and exotic pastels like 
melon and pistachio mixed with bright poppy persian blue and 
black white and navy 
lacroix made good his gift for surprise mixing rustic and fine 
fabrics in his 57 outfits introducing the fringe and occasionally 
poking a hole in his pastel clouds with rhythmic lines and splashes 
of loud color 
minimizing the waist the trapezium and pyramid shapes 
prevailed for day wear at lacroix 
it was pure charm in a powder pink shantung tunic which flared 
over cocoacolored silk linen pencil pants 
a pyramid coatdress in verbena linen flared above the waist or 
a persian blue silk trapezium raincoat also had that demure charm 
bodyskimming softness or smoldering black lace organza and 
raffia took over for afterhours when feminine turns female 
lacroix revealed his knack for the spectacular with a few 
fringes for daywear he dressed up a khaki linen outfit with black 
embroidery on top and black fringes dancing on the skirt a dramatic 
afterdark version featured gold and thread woven pajamas with a 
beaded floorlength fringe 
pantsskirts or strapless jumpsuits as elegant as gowns were 
often topped with intricate embroidery or lace and warn under 
sumptuous jackets 
typifying the mood of wistful romance was his number aptly 
entitled je taime i love you a drifty vanillacolored poncho 
of organza decorated with handpainted flowers and collared with 
lace warn over a sandycolored chiffon pantsskirt 
his piece de resistance was the strapless pique floorlength 
dress tenderly flowered and topped with a shawllike blue ziberline 
jacket with fringe 
torrente maintained parisian chic by day with polka dot pastel 
dresses kick pleats sometimes topped with a bow or tiered dresses 
and always widebrimmed hats 
elegance by night was most notably in black and white 
draped chiffon and crepe held at the shoulder or waist with 
jewels or a bow were lovely smoky chiffon scarves were beautifully 
used in dramatic trains sometimes running from the shoulder 
there was drama in an almost classic solid black gown with 
lapels at the bodice and a whimsical white and black polka dot 
kerchief 
hanae mori ended the days shows with more accolades to 
femininity 
her floorlength yellow draped sheath with a line of ruffles 
running from the shoulders to the toes is a toast to the female 
form the corsage ruffle at the bust is another note to the refined 
sophistication that marked her show

two weeks ago 
palace officials said 164300 people had visited by evening 
sunday the first of three days the palace will be open to the

a cold morning wind did not stop more than 5400 people from 
gathering at nijubashi the palaces main entrance by 9 am when 
a team of police officers pulled the tall wooden gate open 
uniformed police formed a row at the front of the orderly crowd 
as it marched slowly toward the east garden square where a

bulletproof glass of a palace balcony 
displays of chrysanthemums symbols of japans monarchy stood on 
either side of the blackandwhite photograph taken when the 
emperor was 80 years old hirohito died of cancer jan 7 at age 87 
security around the palace was tight with traffic sealed off and 
at least 600 officers patrolling the grounds police watched from 
nearby rooftops as visitors stood in a carefully ropedoff line that 
wound through gravel plazas outside the moated palace 
police say at least six ultraleftist groups including the 
radical chukakuha or middle core faction have threatened to 
disrupt observances for the emperor no incidents were reported 
sunday however 
though conservatively clad men and women over 40 made up most of 
the morning crowd extreme rightists dressed in black suits and 
black ties were a highly visible presence at the palace 
one rightist group formed two rows in military style before 
bowing to the portrait as officials tried to shoo news 
photographers away 
bin akao one of japans bestknown extreme rightists was 
accompanied by about 20 followers in blue uniforms as he folded his 
hands as if in prayer before the nearly 6foottall portrait 
we are going to either see a communist revolution or a revival 
of patriotism he told the associated press these are very 
dangerous times 
akao is head of the staunchly anticommunist great japan patriots 
party which has a membership estimated at up to 5000 
i experienced the war and coming here today i felt sorry for 
the emperor said housewife michiko ozeki 57 he must have had 
a very hard life but he was a wonderful man

the ministers david levy of the hardline likud bloc and yitzhak 
peretz of the ultraorthodox shas party contended herzog should not 
pay respects to hirohito because of japans alliance with nazi 
germany during world war ii israel radio said

authorities are looking into allegations of 
misconduct by investigators in a probe of corruption among prison 
guards after an inmate said he was threatened a newspaper reported 
sunday 
internal reviews by the district attorneys office and police 
department were prompted in part by a workrelease prisoners 
complaint that two investigators threatened to hang him shoot him 
or have him raped by other prisoners for refusing to implicate a 
guard in an alleged february 1988 beating the philadelphia inquirer 
reported 
the corruption probe operation ferret has resulted in criminal 
charges against 58 prison employees 
the newspaper quoted an unidentified police official as saying 
the department is investigating a police detective in connection 
with his work on operation ferret but declined to give details 
operation ferret is a twoyear inquiry that district attorney 
ronald d castille said last year would eventually result in at 
least 100 arrests 
through spokesman terry williamson castille declined to comment 
williamson said office policy prohibits public comment on any 
pending investigation or confirmation of its existence 
the prisoner who complained of the threats brian c kauffman 
27 told the inquirer a member of castilles staff questioned him 
last week about his allegations 
last may according to prison records kauffman told a social 
worker and a corrections sergeant who wrote memos about his 
complaints to their supervisors that two investigators had 
handcuffed him to a chair and accused him of lying to them about the 
alleged february 1988 beating of prisoner william j kennedy 
that beating led to the first wave of arrests last march seven 
guards were accused of beating kennedy at a workrelease residence 
or lying to conceal the incident charges against those guards have 
been dropped or thrown out 
kauffman serving a 3tosevenyear sentence for theft by 
deception told authorities last february that he saw no misconduct 
by guards on the night of kennedys alleged beating 
social worker janet grossman and corrections sgt edward noble 
wrote in memos obtained by the inquirer that kauffman said he was 
taken to the city prisons internal affairs building and threatened 
repeatedly by two investigators whom he could not identify 
according to the memo kauffman said the two men warned him if 
you dont say what we want we are going to hang you from the neck 
here in the back room 
former deputy district attorney odell guyton who initiated 
operation ferret and supervised it until december said he had 
received ms grossmans memo but would not say what he had done in 
response

police arrested up to 500 people 
who tried to attend a vigil at the grave of a student who burned 
himself to death to protest the 1968 sovietled invasion activists 
said sunday 
the protesters were arrested in the village of vsetaty 18 miles 
from prague and the hometown of jan palach who killed himself in 
wencensclas square in january 1969 
activist petr uhl said between 400 and 500 people who tried to 
hold a vigil at the heavily guarded cemetery where palach is buried 
were arrested on saturday police had blocked roads and interrogated 
visitors on saturday 
the arrests bring to 800 the number of people held during a week 
of antigovernment protests the biggest wave of unrest in the 
czechoslovakia in 20 years 
a heavy police presence in prague and vsetaty threats of 
prosecution and the hundreds of arrests appeared to have stilled the 
protests by sunday 
uhl a member of the charter 77 activist group said police 
detained people saturday who could not prove they were vsetaty 
residents he said most were taken to a nearby state farm 
questioned photographed and released 
uhl said two activists ludvik marks of the independent youth 
group czech children and martin litomirsky of the democratic 
initiative apparently had been detained overnight 
uhl also reported that havels lawyer had seen the jailed 
activist on friday he said the activists could face charges with 
penalities of up to three years in jail 
the protests signal a growing frustration with the lack of social 
and economic reforms similiar to those implemented by mikhail 
gorbachev in the soviet union said alexander dubcek whose prague 
spring reforms of czechoslovakia were crushed by soviet troops in 
1968 
dubcek was ousted as former communist party chief in 
czechoslovakia by the soviets in august 1968 after a fleeting 
attempt to introduce many of the reforms now embraced by gorbachev 
dubcek was interviewed by telephone by the italian communist 
party daily lunita which carried a frontpage story on sunday he 
was asked to comment on the current wave of protests in 
czechoslovakia 
there is a basic crisis that involves above all the young 
people the 20yearold children of the prague spring who have 
no future dubcek was quoted as saying 
what young people are asking for is a rebirth of the type 
underway in the soviet union that involves even the party for the 
first thing dubcek said in the interview 
the latest protests began on jan 15 when about 5000 activists 
tried to hold a vigil for palach in wenceslas square police broke 
up the crowd with tear gas and truncheons and arrested 117 people 
palach had set himself on fire in the square to protest the 
soviet invasion that led to dubceks ouster 
on jan 16 czechoslovakias bestknown dissident banned 
playwright vaclav havel and 12 other prominent activists were 
detained after trying to lay flowers in memory of palach they are 
still in jail and fellow activists say it appears they will face 
charges that could jail them for up to two or three years 
mlada fronta said saturday that 280 people were detained thursday 
during the weeks worst violence when riot police charged a crowd 
of more than 2000 and beat several people in prague

communist party chief stipe suvar 
denounced calls for his ouster and warned that the economically and 
ethnically troubled country could fall victim to political 
extremism a published report said sunday 
suvar also predicted frank discussions at a central committee 
meeting this week of the ruling league of communists but implied he 
expected to withstand an effort to run him out of office 
the party chief has been the focus of unprecedented attacks by 
serbian leaders that reflect the hardline stance of the serbian 
communist party led by slobodan milosevic who is believed to have 
presidential aspirations 
suvar president of the executive presidium accused sections 
of the party media and various political meetings of being 
maximally concentrated on dismembering the current central 
committee and its presidium and on eventually replacing 
blocking and fully compromising its current president 
the tension in the country has increased and so has the concern 
of the great majority of yugoslavs for the fate of socialism in 
our country he said in an interview on zagreb television saturday 
night that was carried by newspapers sunday 
suvar warned that rifts in the countrys leadership comprised a 
clash of concepts that could lead the country to extremes 
either restoration of a bourgeois system or neostalinism 
there has been increasing unrest in yugoslavia where inflation is 
hovering at 250 percent living standards are sinking and the 
country is burdened by a 21 billion foreign debt 
suvar said he was deeply convinced that the league of 
communists central committee meeting scheduled for wednesday would 
be marked by a completely open discussion and we must no 
longer play hide and seek 
the central committee meeting is widely expected to reflect 
deepening rifts in the yugoslav leadership and result in a clash 
between liberal factions in the party and a hardline coalition led 
by milosevic 
we must call matters relations and persons by their 
true name suvar said in the interview adding that he was ready 
to fully account for everything before the central committee which 
elected me to the presidium and before the presidium which elected 
me its president 
suvar has been accused at numerous party meetings in serbia and 
in the republic of montenegro of allegedly opposing mass street 
demonstrations that forced the ouster of the entire montenegrin 
ruling elite a communist party conference in the province of 
vojvodina also called for his ouster last week 
the protests were seen in the northern republics of croatia and 
slovenia as having been orchestrated by milosevic supporters to 
bring montenegro under tighter political control by serbia 
however suvar a croat indicated he did not expect the 
communist leadership to replace him saying he hoped to remain party 
chief for the remaining six months of his tenure 
suvar suggested that people taking part in mass rallies that 
forced the resignations of numerous serbian and montenegrin leaders 
allegedly opposed to milosevic were being led astray by 
demagogues 
we can depose leaderships he said but warned such an 
atmosphere would lead us to disaster 
in another development the tanjug news agency reported a 
communist party meeting in the croatian town of zlatar bistrica on 
saturday demanded that milosevic as a member of the yugoslav 
communist party presidium be called to account for 
moralpolitical responsibility over his not reacting to 
unargumented attacks on suvar at the vojvodina party conference 
much of last years unrest has centered on the province of 
kosovo where ethnic albanians form a majority of more than 90 
percent serbia is the largest republic and both provinces kosovo 
and vojvodina are part of it but not fully subject to its control

the red army is pulling out of 
afghanistan with a sense of having failed its mission a soviet 
commander said sunday 
we have not succeeded in everything we planned to do here 
maj gen lev serebrov a political officer at the military high 
command in kabul told western correspondents 
we came here with an honorable task with open hearts we 
are leaving and we have a sense of not having accomplished our 
mission to the end 
serebrov dressed in camouflage uniform chainsmoking and joking 
occasionally with reporters said soviet officers are communicating 
with guerrilla commanders on parts of the key salang highway the 
main route to the soviet border to try to keep it open so that 
supplies may get through 
under a unmediated accord signed in april the soviets 
100000 troops began leaving afghanistan on may 15 and half were 
out by aug 15 the remainder are to leave by feb 15 
the soviets announced late last year they had indefinitely 
suspended the withdrawal of the remaining troops because of 
continued us and pakistani aid to the guerrillas 
serebov disputed reports from western diplomats in kabul that the 
withdrawal already resumed in earnest in early january 
however afghan troops now are manning former soviet posts on the 
perimeter of this beleaguered capital not far from guerrilla 
positions 
and hundreds of fully equipped soviet troops can be seen boarding 
giant ilyushin 76 transport aircraft ferrying in and out of the 
airport daily 
asked how the soviets planned to evacuate troops by air and up 
the hazardous 250mile salang highway by feb 15 in bitter winter 
weather serebrov noted thats our problem 
pressed about visual evidence of troops leaving serebrov 
speaking through an interpreter argued that the departing troops 
had merely completed their twoyear military service and are being 
replaced with new ones 
we are ready to end the withdrawal by feb 15 but we have 
not yet received the order to start the final stage of withdrawal 
he said 
he dodged questions about reports including from one soviet 
source in kabul that the military high command will move from the 
afghan capital to the town of hairatan on the soviet border between 
jan 31 and feb 2 asked how the commanders will go if they remain 
in kabul until the deadline he said we will find a way 
the red army entered afghanistan in december 1979 to back up 
government troops in their war with the moslem guerrillas 
as the soviets have left the guerrillas have closed in on kabul 
raising fears of a bloodbath once afghanistans conscript army is 
left alone 
there could be some instability but i dont think it will 
be critical serebrov said 
soviet officers have privately expressed serious reservations 
about the ability of the afghan army to fight alone 
serebrov said the soviets who last week began an airlift of 
emergency food and fuel to kabul have to feed the whole city 
now 
shortages are worsening in the capital with bread queues forming 
in subfreezing temperatures and roads clogged with lines of cars 
and buses at gasoline stations 
in moscow the soviet communist party daily pravda accused the 
resistance of buying up food supplies in the capital and spiriting 
them out of the city 
it quoted defense minister shakh navaz tanay as saying that 
during a sweep of the city in search of weapons soldiers found 
big supplies of food and goods of priority need 
supply roads into kabul have been blocked periodically in january 
by resistance attacks and by heavy snows pravda said supply trucks 
started getting through the snow and rebel attacks again on jan 19 
serebrov acknowledged that the soviet air force is continuing 
bombing raids on guerrilla positions 
but he accused the united states of repeated violations of the 
un accord by continuing to arm the sevengroup guerrilla alliance 
through neighboring pakistan 
that is why the situation around afghanistan is so tense he 
said this is not because of the presence of soviet troops in the 
country 
he paused and then compared the planned withdrawal favorably with 
the us pullout from vietnam 
he told an american reporter your generals ran away from 
saigon but we have a withdrawal that is proceeding according to a 
timetable 
serebrovs surprise meeting with the small group of western 
reporters came after a news blackout of several weeks by the soviet 
command

prime minister edward seaga and 
opposition leader michael manley plan to meet monday to discuss 
escalating political violence between the governing jamaica labor 
party and the peoples national party 
the two rivals are to meet at the wyndham kingston hotel at 5 
pm shortly after their respective parties nominate the official 
candidates for the feb 9 elections 
the prime minister scheduled the meeting after manley wrote him a 
letter requesting they meet in light of the surge of political 
violence within the past week 
basil francis 58 was killed and merlina wright 49 and norma 
richards 39 were shot and wounded friday during a clash between 
rival political bands in spanish town the police said 
there also have been clashes reported between supporters of 
seagas labor party and manleys peoples national party 
in his letter manley said such confrontations constitute a 
breach of an agreement reached in august 1988 
we agreed for example that every effort should be made to 
ensure that our respective supporters would not be mobilized to 
harass heckle jeer and in particular provoke our opponents at 
public meetings and on tours manley recalled 
i am therefore suggesting that we meet together again very 
urgently to review what has been taking place and finalized 
more precise methods of closer communication manley wrote 
seaga replied quickly in a letter suggesting that they and their 
respective peace committees meet monday to sign previously 
negotiated peace agreements for the constituencies in the kingston 
st andrew and st catherine parishes and then discuss the current 
situation 
i consider that these proposals would send the right signals 
and the talks would be productive based on the earlier discussions 
during this week between the chairmen of the two parties seaga 
said 
manley in his letter had said the recent incidents of violence 
have given me very great concern and he wondered whether 
deliberate acts of provocation were being organized and staged 
at the constituency level to discredit the code of conduct signed 
between the two leaders in august 
justice james kerr the ombudsman for political matters proposed 
over the weekend that both parties ban political motorcades which 
he said served no purpose other than providing a cover for the 
devotees of strife and the promoters of violence to do their 
destructive work 
manley said that the peoples national party already has decided 
not to hold anymore motorcades 
however he said he would tour individual constituencies almost 
daily and his parties other candidates would be doing the same 
what was important he said was that both sides already had 
agreed to provide each other at the national and constituency levels 
with their respective itineraries a procedure which should be 
implemented as a matter of routine from now on 
seaga wrote that several candidates of the jamaica labor party 
share my own concern that political violence is once again rearing 
its ugly head and cited recent incidents in which labor party 
supporters were attacked in st andrew parish 
the prime minister also spoke of the near open warfare now 
taking place in the main urban centers of st catherine 
particularly spanish town and old harbor which culminated with the 
firebombing of the old harbor office of the jlp on friday night

investigators said sunday they have no 
clues to the disappearance of former prime minister paul vanden 
boeynants and are increasingly worried about his safety 
more than eight days after his abduction we are more and more 
frightened said prosecutor andre rutten at the moment there is 
no change whatsoever in the situation 
the previously unknown socialist revolutionary brigade claimed it 
abducted vanden boeynants only hours after his disappearance jan 14 
and said at first he would be killed 
on tuesday it demanded about 800000 in ransom but police have 
not heard from the group since casting doubts whether it kidnapped 
vanden boeynants 
rutten said sunday a judicial dossier on the 69yearold 
christian democratic leader had vanished from the files but was it 
was still unclear whether this was linked to his disappearance 
vanden boeynants was given a threeyear suspended jail sentence 
in 1986 for tax fraud as head of his meatpacking business 
the dossier has documentation on the relations between vanden 
boeynants and two former police officials who have long been 
investigated for a series of crimes 
we have no elements that can make us think there is a relations 
between the disappearance of vanden boeynants and the disappearance 
of the dossier rutten said 
vanden boeynants disappeared on the evening of jan 14 after 
parking his car near his home and police found indications he might 
have been kidnapped 
vanden boeynants was prime minister from 1966 to 1968 and from 
late 1978 to early 1979 he was also defense minister for seven 
years during the 1970s

sikh extremists dragged three hindu men 
from their homes and hanged them to avenge the executions of two 
sikhs convicted in the 1984 assassination of prime minister indira 
gandhi police said sunday 
the saturday night attack in the village of ahema khalan 21 
miles south of amritsar was the second such incident reported since 
satwant singh and kehar singh were hanged in new delhi on jan 6 for 
mrs gandhis assassination 
senior police superintendent suresh arora said six or seven sikhs 
entered gian chands home and took him and his brother madan lal 
their uncle vir bhan was taken from a neighboring house and 
all three men were dragged to the village outskirts and hanged from 
a tree arora said 
he said a note left near the bodies said the killings were in 
retaliation for the executions of satwant singh who was convicted 
of assassinating mrs gandhi and kehar singh who was convicted of 
conspiracy in the killing 
the note bore the name of the kalistan commando force one of 
several extermist groups waging a violent campaign for an 
independent sikh nation arora said 
on jan 11 four hindu brothers were hanged in bhujiawali 40 
miles north of amritsar a note found near their bodies warned that 
more people would be hanged because of the government executions 
sikh militants who killed at least 2440 people in northern 
punjab state last year have killed more than 140 people so far this 
year 
the radicals have been fighting for a separate nation since 1982 
claiming members of their faith are discriminated against by indias 
hindu majority 
sikhs comprise only 2 percent of indias population of 880 
million but form a majority in punjab state hindus account for 
about 80 percent of the national population 
the sikh faith has roots in both hinduism and islam 
in london meanwhile about 4000 sikhs marched through the city 
to protest the executions 
men women and children gathered in hyde park before marching 
along oxford street and kingsway to temple subway station near india 
house the office of the indian high commmmissioner or ambassador 
a police cordon separated the marchers from the commission 
five sikh elders carrying swords and scimitars led the 
procession many marchers wore brightly colored turbans 
on sunday medical student dapinder singh one of the march 
organizers said this procession is the first time that sikhs 
have come together under one banner there are no more factions we 
are unified now and this is terrifying the indian government 
about 400000 sikhs live in britain 
there was one brief scuffle between police and a marcher 
followed by a confrontation with more marchers but an appeal for 
calm by the march stewards defused the situation

president bush taking a pause from celebrative 
inauguration events attended a national worship service sunday 
where he was recognized as the symbol of unity 
the solemn interfaith national prayer service in the 
sanctuary of the ornate washington cathedral served as a quiet 
contemplative climax to a frenetic fiveday inauguration festival 
while bush worshipped with some 3200 others top aides appeared 
on sunday television interview shows to discuss the more secular 
matters of budget deficits and ussoviet relations 
the new president and first lady barbara bush kneeled and prayed 
silently when they entered the cathedral and then joined vice 
president dan quayle and his wife marilyn in a front pew 
presiding over the service was the rev john t walker 
episcopalian bishop of washington who noted that the bushes 
episcopalians themselves had visited with us many times in the 
past he said he hoped to see them often and the bushes had said 
previously that they intended to attend sunday church services 
regularly 
walker spoke of a nation united in the person of our president 
he is our symbol of unity 
the rev peter gomes minister of memorial church at harvard 
university who delivered the principal sermon said we have come 
to pray for the reconcilation of the peoples of the nation 
gomes worried aloud about the destitute of our american 
calcuttas and on behalf of the prisoners of the inner city 
within a few short blocks of this cathedral and beyond he also 
urged compassion for the aged for aids victims and for the 
prisoners of affluence and indifference 
in this he took a page from bushs inauguration address of 
friday in which he said my friends we are not the sum of our 
possessions they are not a measure of our lives 
the bushes and the other worshippers laughed when gomes cited an 
old adage be careful for what you pray you might get it 
the former vice president of the united states prayed doubtless 
to become president and now he has and now we must all pray with 
him and for him gomes said 
bushs oldest son george walker bush 42 participated in the 
service reading a litany and ending it with god protect our 
mother and father 
walker closed the service with the prayer that bush himself had 
used in his inaugural address on friday use power to help people 
there is but one use of power and it is to serve people 
the bushes joined the rest of the congregation in singing songs 
from the printed program including faith of our fathers 
amazing grace and beethovens ode to joy 
bush who surprised top aides and startled white house reporters 
with several spurofthemoment appearances in public in recent 
days remained for the most part behind the scenes sunday 
he hosted an afternoon reception for members of the inauguration 
committee and set aside the early evening to join his family in the 
white house residence theater to watch the super bowl on widescreen 
television 
after the game bush called national football league commissioner 
pete rozelle and invited the victorious san francisco 49ers to visit 
the white house no date was specified 
just before going to church he appeared briefly on the south 
lawn where hed taken grandson george 12 for a walk its a 
great day exclaimed bush who was wearing suitpants and a blue 
windbreaker 
he seemed ready to relax after attending a series of inauguration 
balls friday and two more parties on saturday night at a youth 
rhythmandblues party he got up on the stage and strummed a gift 
guitar a few times 
as bush prepared for his first full week as president his chief 
of staff former new hampshire governor john sununu was describing 
how bush wants to consolidate the redirection of the country 
that had begun during ronald reagans eightyear presidency 
sununu interviewed on cbstvs face the nation said that 
while bush wanted to maintain economic prosperity and continue 
reagans emphasis on a strong defense he also planned to work hard 
on such vexing problems as homelessness drugs child care and 
education 
he acknowledged that budget deficit problems would constrain the 
chief executive but said that in the days between now and feb 9 
when bush plans to address a joint session administration officials 
want to emphasize our commitment to these issues 
sununu said a conservative president can be compassionate 
but he refused to be tied down on whether bushs notax pledge 
would hold up for the next four years 
i think what george bush said to the american people was that 
we will deal with the deficit the fundamental issue without 
raising taxes he said we are putting a blueprint to deal with 
the deficit that does not require taxes 
but when asked whether the bush promise was intended to be good 
for just one year or four years the chief of staff said the pledge 
should be sound as long as the climate of this country is 
appropriate for that commitment to stay in place

by the leftist government demanded a general amnesty on sunday and 
protested forced labor in prison 
the national movement of mothers and relatives of political 
prisoners marked the second anniversary of its founding by holding a 
meeting in the capital where leaders charged the sandinista 
government was denying family visits to political prisoners 
the prisoners are being mistreated in jail and the government 
has denied them family visits for refusing to work said matilde 
gutierrez the groups president she did not elaborate 
she called for a total amnesty in the country for political 
prisoners 
ms gutierrez told the associated press that 19 political 
prisoners have been on a hunger strike since jan 15 in the national 
penitentiary system facility to protest the governments refusal to 
permit visits 
the facility which houses former national guardsmen who fought 
under the late dictator anastasio somoza is located about 14 miles 
northeast of managua 
the sandinistas toppled somoza in the 1979 guerrilla war some of 
the former guardsmen are serving prison terms of up to 30 years 
an official with the interior ministry which operates the 
prison denied that prisoners were fasting 
there is no hunger strike among the prisoners the official 
said on condition of anonymity he acknowledged that they refuse 
to work which is a disadvantage for them the official declined 
to elaborate 
normally all of the prisoners who were closely linked with the 
somoza system dont work they maintain a constant protest and are 
in complete disagreement with the penitentiary system the 
official said 
president daniel ortega said in december that there were 3142 
political prisoners including former guardsmen and antisandinista 
rebels in nicaraguan jails 
ms gutierrez on sunday disputed that figure 
throughout the country there are more than 20000 political 
prisoners and this affects in all some 30000 children she said 
ortega also said the government had released more than 1300 
prisoners in compliance with the central american peace plan signed 
by nicaragua guatemala costa rica el salvador and honduras in 
1987 
also sunday costa rican security authorities said sandinista 
troops shot and killed a young nicaraguan trying to cross into costa 
rica 
luis antonio lopez lopez 17 died friday night while trying to 
get across the san juan river in a tiny boat with 16 other young 
nicaraguans said carlos jimenez spokesman for the costa rican 
public security ministry 
costa rican civil guardsmen reported that the sandinista troops 
opened fire from a hilltop he said in a telephone interview 
a nicaraguan defense ministry official on sunday disputed the 
report and said nicaraguan troops exchanged gunfire with 
antisandinista guerrillas along the border 
costa rica is home to more than 40000 nicaraguan refugees who 
have fled the economic crisis and civil war in their homeland

themselves in to avoid arrest said the reports monitored in 
nicosia the agency said 50 users were handed over to rehabilitation 
centers but did not say what happened to the rest

were turning them away since the new law calls for prosecuting 
anyone who provides a refuge for them the news agency said even

13 percent of mexicos gross national product in interest alone on 
its internal debt in 1988 according to a report by the private

excelsior news agency reported 
mexicos gnp is estimated at 160 billion estimated servicing of 
the domestic debt last year totaled 20 billion while foreign debt 
payments reached around 9 billion

experts said sunday a blowout in the 
norwegian section of the north sea had been averted after a critical 
natural gas leak friday norways national news agency ntb reported 
saga petroleum co had maintained a high alert through the 
weekend after the gas leak friday afternoon when a hose connecting 
the drilling rig treasure saga with a blowout preventor on the 
seabed broke there were no injuries 
the rig was drilling a well in the albuskjell gas field in the 
ekofisk oil and natural gas area in the southernmost part of 
norways north sea section 
saga spokesman bjoern glenne said drilling was suspended and 
the blowout preventor on the seabed quickly closed after the leak 
the well pressure is high but stable the situation is under 
control ntb quoted him as saying 
boots hansen an american blowout expert called in by saga told 
a news conference sunday that the danger appeared to be over 
as long as the blowout preventor has withstood the pressure 
since friday it should continue to do so similar things have 
happened other places in the world ntb quoted him as saying 
hansen came to stavanger 181 miles southeast of the norwegian 
capital oslo on saturday to assist sagas own security team in 
finding ways to reduce the well pressure and strengthen the blowout 
preventor 
on saturday morning treasure saga had been towed 500 feet away 
from the well site only 28 of the 75 rig workers remained onboard 
ntb quoted saga security chief aksel arnecke as saying a new hose 
was underway to replace the one which broke friday and that a first 
attempt to strengthen the blowout preventor will take place within 
a few days 
other alternatives include pumping more heavy drilling mud into 
the well to reduce pressure on the blowout preventor or eventually 
engaging another rig to drill a second well to relieve the pressure 
an operation which could take several months

packages of a storebrand ice cream saturday because of possible 
exposure to ammonia gas during manufacture a spokesman said 
stater brothers markets recalled its brand of squarepack 
halfgallon packages of ice cream in golden vanilla and chocolate 
flavors bearing the code 092289 said spokesman tom reingrover 
its strictly a precautionary thing he said the recall is 
on all of that code however we found very little product affected 
the packages did not necessarily end up in all of stater 
brothers 101 markets in southern california but there was no way to 
determine which stores actually received the lot reingrover said 
the code is printed on an end flap of the packages some of the 
ice cream in those packages may be discolored have an offflavor 
and ammonia odor 
the ice cream was made for stater brothers markets by knudsen co 
but no knudsen products or other brands were affected stater 
brothers said 
reingrover said he did not know how many packages were in the 
recalled lot 
consumers were advised to return the ice cream to the store where 
they bought it to receive a refund 
the ice cream was manufactured in late december and was in the 
stores for a very short period of time reingrover said he did 
not know exactly when it was put into the stores 
the contamination occurred because of a leak of ammonia gas from 
the system that freezes the ice cream during the manufacturing 
process he said

you cant get much farther from the west 
coast than northeast philadelphia 
but underneath the image of a blazing sun on a bright red sign 
elliot stone opened the first west coast video stores in the 
secondlargest city on the east coast 
after five years scores of franchise contracts and the buyout of 
struggling portland orebased national video incs franchise 
operations west coast video has grown into the largest video rental 
outlet in the world even from the start our name had given the 
impression that we were a nationallyfranchised company said 
stone the chains founder and chief executive officer we wanted 
a hollywood image flashing lights tons of glitter 
laden with brightred carpeting and wallpaper tracer lights and 
of course movie posters the west coast video stores have brought a 
franchise formula to what started as familyowned operations with 
little commitment toward growing nationally 
its gone bigtime now and gone beyond the level of stores 
that were opened as a hobby said steven apple executive editor of 
video insider a trade magazine 
every day momandpop stores are closing our stores are 
replacing the momandpop operations stone said 
sitting behind his ushaped desk in his overwhelmingly blue 
office nearly devoid of red stone is a successful entrepreneur 
but not altogether satisfied 
plans for 1989 are to increase growth from three franchises a 
week and one company store every 10 days to opening a new outlet 
every working day 
last year after the acquisition of national video for about 3 
million in cash and the addition of 455 franchised outlets west 
coast had 180 million in revenue according to sarah killion 
company spokeswoman that was up sharply from 1986 revenue of 11 
million 
in its december 1988 issue inc magazine listed west coast video 
as the fourthfastest growing privatelyowned company in the 
country with sales jumping 22653 percent between 1983 and 1987 
as of jan 11 there were 650 stores 455 of which came from 
national video 195 west coast video franchises and 68 companyowned 
stores 
stone said the company has gone through periods when it grew too 
fast for the staff and equipment but he is confident that with vcrs 
in 55 percent of us homes the rental industry will continue to 
grow for another five to 10 years 
competition for west coast however may come from convenience 
and grocery store chains that set aside a rack or corner for movie 
rentals such stores can offer movie rentals at a lower rate because 
they dont depend on rentals for their income also convenience 
stores like 7eleven already have stores on street corners across 
the country 
but according to apple people prefer to go to a store 
specializing in videos by a margin of three to one he said 
customers are attracted by the selection and service provided by a 
video store 
i see it very much as an industry that will continue to be 
dominated by video specialty stores with growing business in 
convenience stores said stephen wilson chairman of fairfield 
group inc a market research firm specializing in the video 
business 
stone started west coast video in september 1983 after he and his 
wife couldnt find the movie they were looking for and thought the 
clerks were rude 
we saw all these people walking into a retail outlet for one 
sole purpose to rent a movie stone said here theyre already 
in the store and not coming out with a movie 
several years ago most video stores kept the tapes behind a 
counter and the customer was expected to walk up with a list of 
movies and ask the clerk which ones were in stock 
stone takes credit for introducing a new system emulated by 
many that displays an empty box for each copy of a movie in stock 
when the customer picks up the box he is assured of being able to 
rent the movie 
many stores will give a customer a free days rental if the movie 
for a displayed box is not in stock 
occasionally with franchisees who have taken a second mortgage 
on their house or invested their life savings in the store it is 
difficult to convince them that giving away 2 worth of rentals will 
pay off if the customer comes back 
at 35000 west coast videos franchise fee is 6000 higher 
than any other video franchiser according to the franchise 
handbook published by enterprise magazines inc of milwaukee wisc 
between 175000 and 250000 in capital is required to start a west 
coast video store

when it comes to innovation in marketing 
and product development campbell soup co lives up to its slogan 
mm mm good according to a survey of senior corporate 
executives who said too many other us corporations lack 
imagination 
in its fourth annual innovation survey group efo ltd found 
that 34 percent of those responding rated campbell the most 
innovative corporation in the united states followed by pillsbury 
co procter amp gamble co hormel amp co and the general foods 
division of philip morris cos inc 
campbell has gone against the tide in a lot of ways edward 
f ogiba president of group efo said friday his consulting firm 
which specializes in consumer attitudes toward new products is 
based in norwalk conn 
they are a big company that is acting like a small company 
ogiba said theyve been willing to take risks and theyve been 
willing to look at quite a wide variety of offerings to find out 
what the consumer really wants 
the survey released last week was based on responses from 75 
chief executives corporate presidents and directors of marketing 
planning and development at some of the worlds largest consumer 
goods companies ogiba said it was cosponsored by food and 
beverage marketing magazine 
ogiba noted that camden njbased campbell has introduced a 
string of hugely successful new product lines over the last several 
years including the upscale le menu frozen dinners prego 
spaghetti sauce pepperidge farm american collection cookies and 
campbells home cookin soups 
the survey found what ogiba calls an alarming lack of confidence 
in the way new products are developed 
eighty percent of those responding predicted that 83 percent of 
all new products introduced this year will fail and 33 percent said 
consumer research was unreliable 
sixtytwo percent believe that products introduced this year will 
prove the same or less innovative than last year fiftyfive percent 
felt product development lacked direction 
ogiba said his survey indicated that marketing executives have 
become mesmerized by the idea of convenience foods that can be 
stored easily or quickly prepared as the key selling point in 
developing new product lines or in coming out with new versions of 
products already on the market 
companies like campbell on the other hand have gone to great 
lengths to explore other characteristics that will appeal to 
consumers ogiba said 
fiftyone percent of those surveyed named japan as the most 
innovative country in the world followed by the united states west 
germany and britain 
the models of innovation are outside the company for most 
marketers today ogiba said in some ways managers are saying 
that their internally driven new product process isnt working and 
that a better more successful approach lies elsewhere

president kenneth kaunda said his southern 
african nation accepted an offer by the international monetary fund 
to resume an economic restructuring program in zambia 
in the text of an interview with us reporters issued sunday 
kaunda said an accord with the imf followed what he described as the 
funds flexible stance toward needy countries 
speaking with jane perlez of the new york times and richard 
bonner of new yorker magazine kaunda said the imf will assist with 
homespun economic reforms adopted by his government since he severed 
ties with the fund in may 1987 
they made soundings that they want to come back and we said 
yes we are ready kaunda told the reporters this should be 
on our own terms and they the imf should only come here to help us 
do what we are already doing he said 
several senior officials of the imf and the world bank visited 
zambia in recent months to negotiate resumed loan assistance 
last year the zambian government cut state subsidies on some 
essential commodities and removed price controls on some items to 
prepare the way for a rapprochement with the imf 
when zambia cut its ties with the imf in 1987 the government said 
the funds economic austerity program was too harsh 
that program called for a massive devaluation of the zambian 
currency and the removal of subsidies on essential goods and corn 
meal the staple food 
government troops shot dead 15 civilians in food riots in late 
1986 after the government slashed its subsidy on corn meal in line 
with imf demands
