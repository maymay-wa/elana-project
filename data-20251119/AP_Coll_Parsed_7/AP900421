we have more people come from new york than any place de 
hart said its a tremendous amount of fun to watch 
de hart said whistling is an ancient art form 
it was an means of communication probably long before we had

computer specialist on a submarine based at pearl harbor

dr malcolm perry would rather be 
remembered for teaching surgery than as the surgeon who worked on 
john f kennedy in a dallas hospital nov 22 1963 and on the 
presidents assassin two days later 
but history seems to be in his way 
in an interview with the columbus dispatch his first 
interview he said since the morning after kennedys death 
perry 60 said he avoids reading or watching programs about 
kennedys assassination and prefers not to talk about such programs 
with fellow workers 
i have no desire to relive the pain he said thursday during 
a break from teaching a twoday course at a vascular disease 
symposium at st anthony medical center perry is now chief of 
vascular surgery at vanderbilt university in nashville tenn 
he said that being in emergency room one at parkland memorial 
hospital the day kennedy was brought in was an accident in 
time the chief surgical resident who had been paged to take the 
case was away that day 
perry said he was in the trauma room with kennedy about 20 
minutes he finds it curious that people are so interested in those 
20 minutes 
i dont resent it he said its a matter of proportion 
though things arent real balanced in the world 
perry said what he did with kennedy was no different than what 
he had done before or has done since to save others 
there are only two medical emergencies airway obstruction 
and bleeding he said mr kennedy had both 
to clear kennedys airways perry performed a tracheotomy in 
which a hole is cut in the windpipe he said he wasnt aware of it 
at the time but recalled hours later that jacqueline kennedy was 
watching the procedure 
every time i looked up i saw her standing there in the 
corner watching he said 
in performing the tracheotomy perry cut through the bullet exit 
wound in the presidents neck officials later investigating the 
assassination asked why the wound wasnt measured and why doctors 
didnt turn kennedy over to examine the wound in the back of his 
head 
perry said legal issues never occurred to him there wasnt time 
you get the airway clear you stop the bleeding then you see 
what else youve got he said 
even with advances in medical technology over the past 26 years 
perry said the same head wound would be fatal today 
when kennedy was pronounced dead perry said he left the trauma 
room and sat down but was called almost immediately to operate on 
thengov john connally of texas who was riding with kennedy and 
also was wounded but lived 
two days later perry operated on kennedys assassin lee harvey 
oswald who had just been shot by jack ruby oswald also died 
perry said coping with his role became more difficult when he 
and his family began receiving hate mail charging he was part of a 
conspiracy to kill the president 
the warren commission established to investigate the 
assassination concluded that oswald acted alone in killing kennedy

the soviet unions economy turned in an 
abysmal performance last year and faces the likelihood of 
continued inflation and shortages despite president mikhail 
gorbachevs reform efforts according to a us intelligence 
analysis 
soviet economic problems reached nearcrisis proportions in 
1989 as severe consumer goods shortages inflation and rising 
social and ethnic violence left gorbachev searching for ways to put 
his economic program back on track said the report to congress 
the combination of inflation and shortages made daily life 
miserable for all but the most privileged elements of society 
said the joint central intelligence agencydefense intelligence 
agency report 
cia deputy director for intelligence john l helgerson told the 
joint economic committee on friday that the soviet economic 
performance was abysmal in 1989 the worst since gorbachev took 
over in 1985 
the report also noted a 4 percent to 5 percent drop in real 
soviet defense spending last year which should strengthen the 
position of those in congress seeking larger pentagon budget cuts 
it forecast a daunting road ahead for the emerging 
democracies in eastern europe with high unemployment price 
increases and falling wages but the analysts said poland and other 
countries are making good starts at attracting the private 
investment needed for recovery 
helgerson said soviet energy production dropped last year for 
the first time in four decades and there were declines in the 
industrial construction and transportation sectors consumer 
prices rose an estimated 6 percent and shoppers turned to 
blackmarket sources for goods and essentials that were rationed 
in an effort to meet consumer demand the soviets boosted 
imports of some items and coupled with a decline in oil exports 
piled up a 14 billion trade deficit he said 
overall economic growth for 1989 was about 15 percent the 
report said although it noted that figure is based on dubious 
statistics and does not take into account distribution problems 
that kept goods from reaching consumers 
helgerson said the first quarter of 1990 has not been promising 
and the prospect for even a modest economic recovery seems to us 
remote at best inflation and shortages will probably persist he 
said 
the economy in fact could deteriorate sharply helgerson 
said it is in a fragile state and a severe shock could cause 
output to drop precipitously shocks could come from ethnic 
unrest strikes or consumer panic he said 
on wednesday secretary of state james a baker iii told the 
house ways and means committee the soviet reform effort is 
sporadic poorly designed and hampered by bureaucratic resistance 
and lack of public acceptance 
gorbachev will continue to shift his countrys military 
production machine into making consumer durable goods to cope with 
the problems said helgerson and dennis m nagy a senior dia 
official 
cuts in troops and conventional arms gorbachev announced more 
than a year ago are well on their way to accomplishment nagy 
said the dia believes at least half the promised tank reductions 
and about threefourths of the artillery and combat aircraft 
reductions have been made he said 
the value of soviet military aid to third world countries 
dropped last year to 17 billion about 2 billion below the 
previous years figure said nagy lower shipments to iraq and 
other middle east states accounted for the drop he said

a woman whose account of sen robert f 
kennedys assassination touched off conspiracy theories has been 
charged with embezzling 9800 from a councilwomans campaign funds 
sandra serrano sewell 42 of pasadena was expected to 
surrender sometime next week on one felony charge of grand theft by 
embezzlement deputy district attorney steven e weiss said friday 
sewell allegedly took the money while bookkeeping for the 
committee to reelect gloria molina in 1985 the alleged 
embezzlement was discovered during a routine audit by the state 
fair political practices commission two years later the 
councilwoman took the case to the district attorneys office 
sewell gained fame in 1968 when she claimed to have seen a woman 
in a polkadot dress running from the scene of kennedys 
assassination at the ambassador hotel shouting we shot him we 
shot him 
sewell then sandra serrano said that when she asked the woman 
who was shot the woman replied senator kennedy 
sandra serrano was questioned at length by police officers and 
her interviews comprised a large portion of long secret 
investigative reports in the case released in 1988 
police files released that year showed that the woman withdrew 
her statement two weeks after the june 5 1968 killing saying 
the whole thing was a lie 
but her story was often resurrected by conspiracy buffs who 
suggested the woman in the polkadot dress was part of an 
assassination plot sirhan b sirhan was convicted of kennedys 
killing and is serving a life sentence 
sewell declared in 1988 that police had harassed her into into 
recanting 
there was a lot of badgering that was going on i was just 20 
years old and i became unglued i said what they wanted me to 
say she said 
police dismissed the womans badgering allegations 
she did not tell the truth said cmdr william booth 
spokesman for the police department

congressional democrats are putting together a 
1991 budget that ignores a flagging economy and relies in part on 
dubious savings the white house budget director says 
the budget chief richard darman said friday that democratic 
spending plans under consideration are not implementable 
because they fail to take administration preferences into account 
but also said the attitude of leading congressional lawmakers 
toward budget negotiations with the administration is improving 
its highly likely we could move to negotiations in a matter 
of weeks said darman who has been pressing for such talks since 
president bush submitted his 1991 spending plan in january 
darmans comments made in a session with reporters marked a 
continuation of his attempt to insert the administration into 
democratic efforts to write a budget for the year that begins oct 
1 
the house budget committee adopted a democraticwritten 124 
trillion budget on thursday and the panels senate counterpart 
plans to begin its own work next week 
darman called the house document a slideby budget lacking 
serious deficit reduction the same criticism democrats have 
leveled at the white houses own plan 
he said the democratic plan which claims to reduce next years 
deficit by 36 billion relies on 93 billion in savings that 
democrats themselves have called questionable these include 
improved tax collections user fees that have been rejected before 
and interesting other gimmicks he said 
darman said the bush administration now believes next years 
deficit will be 85 billion to more than 20 billion worse than 
the 1005 billion shortfall it projected in january he attributed 
this to the economys worsethanexpected performance in recent 
months 
the grammrudman law sets a 64 billion shortfall target for 
fiscal 1991 
darman criticized democrats for not adjusting their proposal to 
account for the poorer economic figures the democratic plan calls 
for 36 billion in deficit reduction rather than the minimum of 
45 billion darman said is really needed 
when president bush introduced his budget in january capitol 
hill democrats said he had used unrealistic economic projections 
they were right darman said but he added that in writing 
their own budget package they have decided they will ignore 
that 
the better the economy performs the more taxes the government 
collects and the smaller the federal deficit 
house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif flew 
back to his district friday and could not be reached for comment 
but after his panel approved the democratic fiscal package on a 
partyline 2114 vote thursday he said he could defend the plan 
very strongly

the film named for the florida panhandle town where the 
hospital is located about 40 miles northwest of tallahassee

of calhoun a korean war veteran who was suffering from what now is 
known as posttraumatic stress syndrome 
calhoun 56 was committed in 1956 after he shot himself in a 
failed suicide attempt and was released in 1962 after an

the district attorneys office said three 
physicians who treated elizabeth taylor overprescribed narcotics 
for the actress but will not be criminally prosecuted 
it is clear that the prescribing practices of these physicians 
fell below the accepted standard of medical practice deputy 
district attorney daniel feldstern wrote in a report on drs 
william skinner michael gottlieb and michael roth 
however it is equally clear that these physicians in trying 
to resolve the patients medical condition were also attempting to 
deal with her addiction through alternative means of therapy and 
treatment and that their conduct was lacking in the requisite 
criminal intent 
the district attorneys office will refer the case to the state 
medical board 
in 1983 miss taylor acknowledged a 35year addiction to 
sleeping pills and painkillers prescribed for health problems and 
she was treated at the betty ford center in rancho mirage for 
alcohol and drug abuse 
she was treated by the three doctors in 1987 and 1988 among 
drugs skinner prescribed were demerol percodan valium ativan 
xanax preludin and dilaudin 
on friday meanwhile miss taylor 58 was in stable condition

new us visa regulations leave the door open 
for suspected nazi war criminals to enter the united states say 
officials who have intercepted about 12 of them trying to get into 
the country in recent months 
those caught were west germans took advantage of a program 
enacted last summer which allows residents of west germany to enter 
the united states without a visa 
previously west germans had to apply for visitor visas at a 
us consulate where their applications were checked against the 
thousands of names on a watchlist of suspected nazi war 
criminals 
under the program visitors are now screened when they reach a 
us airport or border crossing their passports are then checked 
against an immigration and naturalization service computer list of 
people ineligible to enter the united states 
but officials say some probably get through either because of 
inefficiency or work overload 
neal sher who heads the justice departments nazihunting 
office said he expects an increase in the number of interceptions 
as the summer tourist season begins 
he said the changed visa rules tie up his time with calls from 
various airports where inspectors have stopped people with names 
corresponding to those on the watchlist 
sher said a man who recently arrived at bostons logan airport 
on a saturday night after winning a free trip to the united 
states that included a cruise from florida was found to have been 
extradited to poland in 1947 from the us zone of west germany for 
suspected involvement in nazi atrocities 
we put him on a plane home the next morning sher said 
but with the dropped visa requirement the last line of 
defense has become the first sher said 
sher said some take a chance on slipping past passport control 
last saturday he said another west germans name popped up in 
the ins computer when he arrived at the airport in fort lauderdale 
fla 
sher said he went to his office and found the man had been a 
guard at a nazi death camp under questioning which sher directed 
by phone the man admitted he had an underarm tattoo of the elite 
nazi ss unit 
needless to say he never got to see florida either said 
sher 
although sher has complained to other government agencies 
involved in the program the state department said it was very 
satisfied with the visa waiver scheme 
the ins said some 121000 west germans entered the united states 
between july and december in 1989 only 46 west germans were 
refused entry among them about a dozen for suspected nazi activity 
the watchlist compiled by the justice department includes 
names of people ineligible to enter the country for various 
reasons including suspected criminal or terrorist activity 
people are placed on the list who are suspected of complicity 
with nazi war crimes but they are not necessarily considered 
indictable in the united states 
when the justice department has evidence about a watchlist 
suspect which it believes is sufficiently grave and irrefutable it 
informs west germany or other countries that may want to prosecute

the anne frank museum which 
includes the cramped attic in which her family hid from the nazis 
will expand to accommodate surging popularity among tourists 
the space we have now is literally too small for all the 
visitors marie josee rijnders coordinator of the expansion 
project said friday 
the museum is made up of two canal houses that have become the 
nations most visited historic landmark 
the young jewish girls writings during her time in hiding 
the diary of anne frank gained her worldwide fame after her 
death in a nazi concentration camp 
officials say a new building will be constructed next to the 
museum at a cost of 32 million and will quadruple the exhibition 
area 
the expansion is expected to take at least six years to complete 
officials expect about 640000 visitors this year 40000 more 
than last year 
an average of almost 2000 visitors a day jam into the museum to 
see the cramped attic where the frank family lived for two years 
before being captured in 1944 and sent to concentration camps 
known to readers of anne franks diary as the annex the 
apartment is entered through a door hidden behind a bookcase 
anne franks house is the most popular historical landmark in 
the netherlands said amsterdam tourist bureau spokesman herman 
ter balkt its no wonder theyre in dire need of more room 
before the nazis invaded the netherlands in 1940 the building 
on the princes canal housed the spice business of anne franks 
father otto the house next door was taken over by the private 
museum foundation to add exhibit space 
the hiding place is the museums focal point the rest of the 
complex is devoted to exhibitions dealing with the ordeal of the 
frank family and other dutch jews as well as exhibits detailing 
other forms of racism 
the museum shouldnt just refer to the past ms rijnders 
said our aim is to combat present day forms of discrimination 
antisemitism and racism 
plans to add to the museum had initially drawn protests from 
neighbors and the national monument preservation service but they 
were withdrawn when the foundation running the museum limited the 
expansion to a separate new building 
the foundation had initially sought to rebuild a house next door 
into a viewing gallery from which visitors could look out onto the 
loor apartment where the frank family hid but opponents said the 
redesign would ruin the authenticity of the hideaway

federal health officials say they will 
probably ease a policy that bars blood donations from all haitians 
and black africans who were considered at high risk for carrying 
the aids virus 
immigrants from haiti and from subsaharan africa say they are 
unfairly stigmatized by the ban which they claim has no scientific 
basis 
our blood is as safe as anybody elses blood alix mathieu 
a university of cincinnati medical school professor who is haitian 
told a food and drug administration advisory committee on friday 
the scientific facts are not very hard he said urging 
that we be considered as any other americans 
the panel of experts recommended the blooddonor exclusion be 
dropped and the fda instead develop screening questions and 
procedures to identify those haitians and black africans who are at 
high risk for aids 
dr paul parkman the fdas aids coordinator said the agency 
will likely make some changes in the policy but he noted that 
while three panel members approved the recommendation two others 
voted for a less drastic course 
were inclined to change the policy as long as the safety of 
the nations blood supply can be maintained parkman said but we 
need to think a little bit about what each of the committee 
members said 
the difficulty fda scientists say is the virus is spread among 
haitians and subsaharan africans chiefly through heterosexual 
contact they say it is more difficult to identify risk from 
heterosexual contact than risk from homosexual contact or 
needlesharing by intravenous drug users which is how the virus 
usually spreads among black hispanic and white americans 
but haitianamericans aids activists and the american red cross 
urged the agency to find some way to screen for high risk donors 
without stigmatizing whole segments of the population 
it is a racist behavior said brunir shakelton executive 
director of the cambridge american haitian association 
several dozen haitians attended the meeting at the fdas 
headquarters in nearby rockville md at the same time in new york 
50000 haitians and african americans protesting the ban rallied in 
lower manhattan closing the brooklyn bridge for more than two 
hours and tying up traffic around city hall 
all donated blood is tested for the aids virus before it is 
used but an infected person may not test positive for six months 
after they contracted the virus 
the ban has been in place in part since 1984 when haitians 
who had emigrated to the united states since 1977 were excluded 
from the list of eligible donors central africans were added in 
1986 and that was extended to include immigrants from subsaharan 
africa and nearby islands haitians and subsaharan africans who 
had emigrated before 1977 were added in february 
the panel voted after several dozen haitians told the fda 
committee they consider the ban discriminatory witnesses said the 
policy has cost haitians their jobs and homes 
parkman said he was inclined to allow haitians who came to the 
united states before 1977 to donate blood as scientific evidence 
indicates those who emigrated after that have most of the cases of 
aids 
for subsaharan africans he said he was inclined to allow them 
to donate blood if a blood bank has the ability to test donors for 
the hiv2 virus as well as the hiv1 
the hiv2 virus is a less common cause of aids there is 
currently no test in the united states for detecting the evidence 
of hiv2 but some tests are in development

mayor marion barry spoke of previous cocaine 
use and put some crack in his jacket pocket the night the fbi 
arrested him for smoking the drug prosecutors say 
in court papers prosecutors said the district of columbia mayor 
and exmodel rasheeda moore talked of their previous times 
together including their past cocaine experiences when they met 
in a hotel room jan 18 
the us attorneys office filed the papers friday in opposition 
to barrys motion for dismissal of drug and perjury charges against 
him barry argues his right to due process was violated because the 
government manufactured the crime against him 
but the prosecutors said barrys conversation confirms that he 
had drugs on his mind as soon as he arrived in the room at the 
vista international hotel where the mayor was the target of an 
undercover sting operation 
once he was alone in the room with ms moore he asked her in 
their coded vocabulary if she was still using drugs said the 
filing 
once crack cocaine was obtained from an undercover agent posing 
as a friend of moores barry took a portion of the crack and 
placed it inside his jacket pocket which was hanging on a door knob 
nearby said the papers 
according to the prosecutors barry made several unsuccessful 
attempts to get moore to smoke the crack it was the mayor who 
walked over to the pipe arranged the crack in the pipe produced 
a cigarette lighter and lit the crack in the pipe 
the mayor inhaled deeply on the pipe and held his breath 
said the prosecutors after exhaling he again inhaled 
deeply on the pipe and held his breath after taking two hits from 
the pipe he put on his jacket and called his security officer by 
walkietalkie as though he was ready to leave 
law enforcement officers then entered from an adjoining room and 
arrested the mayor 
barry asked for the crack he eagerly accepted it and he 
appeared to be quite adept at smoking it the prosecutors said 
the prosecutors also said that at the start of their 
conversation barry indicated to moore he wanted cocaine 
powder not crack but when the undercover agent left the room to 
get powder barry told moore to get crack instead said the court 
filing moore called the undercover agent back in the room barry 
gave money to moore and moore bought a bag of crack 
barry faces trial june 4 on five counts of cocaine possession 
and three counts of allegedly lying to a federal grand jury by 
denying he had been involved in drugs with charles lewis a former 
city employee lewis is now the governments chief witness against 
the mayor

martin vanden eykel ii was told to beware 
the mountain 
the army doesnt know whether the helicopter pilot from illinois 
slammed his aircraft into rock or was killed by enemy fire during a 
night mission in vietnam 
but on friday nearly 21 years his death his remains and those 
of three fellow soldiers were buried at arlington national cemetery 
the void will always be there because i lost my son said 
wilma vanden eykel but im glad that instead of wandering the 
jungles for 20 years he is with the lord 
the remains of her son of wheaton ill were buried with those 
of william d sanderlin of fort worth texas michael h shanley 
jr of la mesa calif and william c dunlap of tucson ariz 
an army band marched to the grave leading the horsedrawn 
carriage that carried the casket on an otherwise cool and cloudy 
day the sun suddenly appeared as the band leader raised his baton 
for amazing grace and the mourners settled in velvetcovered 
chairs 
the chaplain lt col john w morrison said a short prayer and 
blessed the casket a group of soldiers fired three loud volleys 
and a bugler followed with taps 
we still have a great pain in our hearts for all the boys who 
are still missing in vietnam said maury vanden eykel brother of 
the fallen pilot 
wed like to see some answers for their families too he 
said 
on dec 2 1969 vanden eykel and the other soldiers were aiding 
american ground troops by firing flares during night combat 
another helicopter on the same mission warned that both aircraft 
had to change course to avoid a mountain 
vanden eykel 26 at the time said he felt dizzy he 
acknowledged the warning but his helicopter soon disappeared it 
was never found despite a fourday search 
vietnam returned 25 sets of american remains in january 1989 
the identities of dunlap a chief warrant officer and sanderlin a 
staff sergeant were confirmed through dental records 
vanden eykel a chief warrant officer and shanley a sergeant 
have never been positively identified but two months ago a 
military board ruled that the mens remains were included with 
those of dunlap and sanderlin

researchers say theyve found a new link 
between genetics and aids that could help explain why some people 
become sick soon after exposure while others stave off serious 
illness for years 
in a study of 5000 infected men from baltimore chicago los 
angeles and pittsburgh those with a particular genetic background 
tended to have a more rapid decline after being exposed to the 
aidscausing virus the researchers said friday 
it has been a point of considerable interest because the 
effects of aids differ so widely said dr june osborn of the 
national commission on aids 
the key finding is that there may be genetic differences that 
you inherit that once youre infected with hiv it increases your 
vulnerability to develop severe diseases said dr charles 
rinaldo jr an assistant professor of pathology at the university 
of pittsburgh 
aids researchers have long suspected that factors besides hiv 
exposure determined the course of the disease the main suspects 
genetic factors and other viruses 
hiv is a necessary agent but it may not be a sufficient cause 
to develop the fullblown disease rinaldo said those 
individuals with these cofactors may get the disease more readily 
from its original pool researchers from the university of 
pittsburgh and the national institute of allergy and infectious 
diseases analyzed data from 108 white men who were hivpositive 
had high levels of t4 cells which generate a humans immune 
response and are the hivs main targets and were free of aids 
symptoms 
the pool of men was reduced to obtain a group with similar 
backgrounds afterward the researchers split the smaller group of 
men placing together 49 with rapid immune system decline and 59 
who remained in relatively good health 
in the 49 whose health had declined 20 percent had a 
combination of four particular antigens which provoke an immune 
system response 
there was a significant difference compared with those whose 
immune status had remained stable rinaldo said 
isolating the genetic similarity in only 20 percent of the aids 
victims probably indicates other factors are involved rinaldo said 
possible links between hiv exposure and genetics have come up 
before but their medical applications have been questioned said 
dr jeffrey laurence a researcher at the cornell medical center at 
new york hospital 
people for years have been trying to find an association 
and with so many conflicting results laurence said ive heard 
of these associations before but they were never strong enough to 
help you clinically 
its just another little piece of a very complex story can 
you ever predict whos going to go on and develop a disease thats 
going to be fatal 
rinaldo said that as work progresses on other factors doctors 
will be able to make more informed decisions and possibly move away 
from the current policy to give the medication azt to any 
hivpositive person whose t4 cells are depressed 
we may be able to look at different ways to approach a 
prognosis and predict with a little more accuracy those individuals 
who will likely do worse rinaldo said 
but laurence said im skeptical that theres going to be a 
big clinical payback 
the research team said it was premature for those at risk for 
aids development to use the data to predict how sick they would get 
we dont want guys getting very expensive tests its 
premature to say that this is a key to whether or not you will 
develop aids rinaldo said

the air force is investigating hairline 
cracking in a rear section of the b2 stealth bomber that may be 
caused by exposure to high temperatures 
the cracking was found during a routine inspection of the 
radarevading aircraft on march 30 air force spokesman maj dick 
cole said friday 
the cracking was located behind the planes engine exhaust 
outlets 
the problem was first reported in the magazine aviation week amp 
space technology 
they are trying to sort out exactly what caused the problem 
and identify it cole said they think it could be due to the 
high temperatures but they just dont know when they identify the 
fix it will be incorporated into the production of the aircraft 
cole said that in the meantime the sections with the cracking 
will be removed and replaced with new titanium patches 
titanium which is highly heat resistant and is very strong 
also was used in the nowretired reconnaissance aircraft sr71 
however shortages of the material are plaguing the aerospace 
industry 
cole said it wasnt clear whether the problem would delay the 
planes testing process the aircraft which first flew in 
november was scheduled to undergo additional flight testing this 
month 
on capitol hill backing for the highcost aircraft has been 
eroding 
recently one bipartisan group of senators urged cancellation as 
they released a congressional study concluding that slowing down 
production would raise the cost of a single plane from about 530 
million to more than 1 billion 
acknowledging the growing opposition air force secretary donald 
rice said that the service is reviewing possible alternatives to 
buying all 132 planes now sought

a convicted killer who had demanded 
that his lawyers halt efforts to stop his execution was put to 
death early saturday for the slaying of a houston taxi driver 
jerome butler who had spent about half of his life behind bars 
was given a lethal injection at 1215 am and pronounced dead at 
1226 am 
i just want to say i wish everybody a good life and things 
like that everything is okay he said he nodded to the prison 
warden and to a chaplain coughed several times and stopped 
breathing 
butler whose age on record was 54 although he claimed to be 
several years older was sentenced for the 1986 shooting death and 
robbery of 67yearold nathan oakley of houston he refused any 
interviews from prison 
butler who has passed competency tests was the first person to 
be executed willingly in texas since robert streetman ordered his 
attorneys to make no further efforts on his behalf he was put to 
death jan 7 1988 
butler was the 34th inmate to be executed since texas resumed 
carrying out the death penalty in 1982 the total is the highest of 
any state nationally he was the 122nd person executed since a 
1976 us supreme court ruling allowed states to resume capital 
punishment 
state corrections officials said butler had not filed any 
appeals by friday afternoon 
i just want to get it over with butler said last month when 
his execution date was set they could take these cuffs off me 
and walk me back to death row and i still wont resist there 
wont be no appeals 
one of butlers attorneys vic pecorino had said butler could 
be spared if he had a change of heart 
without cooperation from him what are you going to appeal 
pecorino said 
prosecutors said butler may have killed oakley because the cab 
driver recognized butler as the man who killed his friend ac 
johnson in 1973 butler served 10 years of a 30year prison term 
for that slaying 
this is what ive been waiting for for this moment to know 
this man can not take away another wifes husband and childrens 
father oakleys widow robbie said friday its been a 
difficult three and a half years i wish i could be there to see 
it 
butler spent 27 years behind bars beginning with a 
23to47year term in new york in 1959 for robbery attempted 
sexual assault and accessory to rape he was paroled in 1972 
the following year he was arrested for the johnson slaying and 
sentenced to 30 years for murder he was freed in 1984

with just six weeks left to prepare a 
superpower summit us officials reported a productive meeting 
between secretary of state james a baker iii and a senior soviet 
arms control negotiator 
viktor p karpov met with baker and undersecretary reginald 
bartholomew on friday in an effort to restart momentum toward a new 
treaty to reduce longrange nuclear weapons 
a senior us official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
it was a very productive worthwhile meeting but refused to 
provide any details 
but time is running out before soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev comes to washington for a fiveday summit that begins may 
30 other american officials acknowledged 
hope has been abandoned that gorbachev and president bush might 
sign a completed arms treaty at the summit 
two weeks ago after talks between foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze and baker us and soviet officials acknowledged that 
even a framework agreement on key issues might not be ready for 
bush and gorbachev to initial 
one key stumbling block is us refusal to limit ballistic 
missiles with multiple warheads aboard submarines while insisting 
that the soviets agree to a ban on landbased missiles with 
multiple warheads 
the us navy is preparing to deploy new d5 ballistic missiles 
carrying eight warheads each on submarines most soviet 
multiwarhead missiles are concentrated on land 
baker and shevardnadze also could not agree on limiting cruise 
missiles carried aboard jet fighters the soviets want a lower 
ceiling than the united states which is developing a new missile 
within the range the soviets would put offlimits 
baker and shevardnadze agreed to meet again in the soviet union 
on may 1619 probably at a black sea resort 
karpovs visit here was an unusual move that reflected growing 
anxiety on both sides 
they are trying to put it back on track a us official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity said about the strategic arms 
reduction treaty start 
we have had a crescendo of progress until the last round here 
when little or nothing got done 
there is a lot of work to be done said margaret d

a top aluminum manufacturer is tugging at 
heartstrings not just pocketbooks to stimulate recycling among 
whitecollar beer and soda drinkers by promising to donate profits 
from returned cans to charity 
the aluminum company of america is financing the projects to 
lure upscale beverage consumers who are unmoved by what amounts to 
an 11cent bounty on a sixpack in states that dont have deposit 
laws 
if we can find a cause well motivate them alcoa spokesman 
john van devender said 
alcoa said most of 1400 can collectors it recently surveyed 
coming into alcoa redemption centers earn less than 35000 
annually that means theres a wealthier pool of potential 
recyclers for the beverage industry to tap 
us aluminum makers have said they want to recycle more cans 
rather than make new aluminum with their powerthirsty smelters 
the industry hopes to recycle three out of four cans by 1995 the 
current rate is three out of five 
theres a large element out there the upper and middle 
classes thats still not recycling said george cobb president 
of alcoas recycling division there are a lot of costs involved 
in collecting cans in terms of gas mileage and time its hard 
to move people 
recycling revenue already has helped pay for restoration of a 
battleship near houston while a nationwide network of municipal 
and volunteer fire companies collects cans and donates the proceeds 
to young burn victims 
volunteer firefighter henry urban of cherry city pa drove to 
an alcoa recycling center in pittsburgh on thursday to drop off two 
bags of cans collected by his grandson mark 
alcoa donates the money to a hospital and mark gets to know 
that hes doing some good urban said 
the urbans are not alcoas typical customers the companys 
survey said 60 percent of recyclers are motivated by cash alone 
only 25 percent said they want to reduce waste in the environment 
i do it for the money said john lucci after hauling in 36 
pounds of cans some of which overflowed from the covered bed of 
his pickup truck the aluminum booty brought him 13 
pennsylvania is one of 41 states without a statewide law 
mandating deposits on aluminum cans to encourage recycling alcoa 
says the states with such laws are california iowa michigan 
oregon connecticut new york massachusetts vermont and maine 
trade figures show beverage makers used 65 percent more 
aluminum cans in 1989 the recycling rate also grew from 546 
percent of cans reused in 1988 to a record 608 percent last year 
according to the aluminum association a trade group 
the increase marks a recovery from the leaner days of the 
mid1980s aluminum recession like other major producers committed 
to buy every can collected by scrap aluminum dealers alcoa piled 
mountains of surplus cans outside recycling centers during the 
slowdown 
we knew wed eventually work the surplus off van devender 
said if we were going to build this giant recycling system we 
knew wed have to get through the good years and the bad years 
the recycling boom last year spawned new canmelting plants in 
sheffield ala houser idaho and berea and morgantown ky in 
contrast the last new aluminum smelter started production in 1980 
producing aluminum through recycling is far less expensive than 
smelting new aluminum the current cost of a smelter similar in 
size to the recently opened recycling plant in berea would cost 
600 million industry observers say 
the berea plant the largest of its kind with the capabilty of 
recycling 120 million tons of cans a year cost 50 million said 
stan lampe a spokesman for alcan the company that owns the plant 
the aluminum industry uses 1 percent of the electricity 
generated in the country and most of that is consumed by smelters 
according to an alcoa annual report 
the aluminum industry is by nature capital intensive 
recycling is not lampe said we see it as one of our major 
growth areas 
so do pennsylvania and the dozen other states that have passed 
socalled curbside collection laws effective in september 
pennsylvanias law forces 408 larger communities and townships to 
separate and recycle aluminum as well as glass steel paper and 
plastics 
alcoas cobb said the laws could pose a problem for the company 
because it must train thousands of municipal garbage workers to 
prepare aluminum for shipment foreign material in a batch of scrap 
aluminum can cause explosions during melting or health problems for 
consumers he said 
mildred wood of ross township said efforts like mandatory 
recycling and charitable causes are needed ms wood who collects 
cans from the 18 residents of her apartment building said the 
tenants use recycling checks to buy garden hoses and hardware for 
their building 
the times coming she said when we all should be 
recycling

six men are charged with operating as brokers for 
the vietnamese government to sell us military hardware abandoned 
at the end of the vietnam war to parties in the united states 
a fivemonth us customs service probe resulted in indictments 
unsealed friday against the men and three firms they represent 
they are charged with violations of the trading with the enemy act 
which limits travel and commerce with a handful of nations vietnam 
among them 
the defendants were seeking buyers for parts from 150 c130 
transport planes and an undetermined number of a37 sky raiders 
and usmade m16 and sovietmade ak47 rifles as well as more 
than 4 million metric tons of rice custom officials said 
these commodities have been sitting over there since 1975 and 
we are aware that they are occasionally offered for sale in whole 
or in airplane parts said charles s harrison assistant special 
agent in charge for the houston customs service office 
millions of dollars worth of us weapons and other hardware 
were seized by communist forces when they overran south vietnam in 
1975 and the vietnamese government has given away or sold some of 
the materiel vietnamera assault rifles have been recovered from 
leftist guerrillas in el salvador for example 
robert c debrophy 61 khanh cong tang 41 bao tran 57 and 
guy willard tooker 63 were arrested friday roy john scott 63 
and binh vinh tran remained at large 
the firms named in the indictment were royal colombia and its 
predecessor middle east american co inc and nualart imex corp 
us magistrate frances h stacy scheduled an arraignment 
hearing for thursday bond was set at 20000 each and all but 
debrophy were required to post 2000 cash 
tang and the two trans are naturalized us citizens from 
vietnam 
assistant us attorney mike clark refused to comment other than 
to characterize the charges as serious if convicted each 
defendant faces a maximum of 15 years in prison and 500000 in 
fines

undercover agent the brokers were in touch with said all 
transactions were being negotiated directly with the aviation 
department of the vietnamese government according to the 
indictment 
it alleged that bao tran was a gobetween with vietnamese 
government officials tang and binh vinh tran courted prospective 
buyers tooker financed the operations and debrophy and scott

the enraged bear that chased two 
brothers down a hill after they poked around its den was brought 
down by their father but many alaskans apparently think the 
brothers nearly got what was coming to them 
the newspaper report friday that provided harrowing details of 
the encounter between the bear and brian and doug dixon caught the 
attention of state wildlife protection agents who said they 
received dozens of calls requesting state action 
some of the callers were hunting opponents but others were 
hunters concerned that the bear apparently had been disturbed in 
its den in violation of hunting etiquette said fish and game 
spokesman bruce bartley 
according to reports the dixons were hunting a week ago 125 
miles northwest of anchorage in the alaska range when brian 19 
and doug 22 approached a bear den unarmed with their father jim 
dixon on a snowmachine about 125 yards away 
while they were examining the entrance of the den the bear 
bolted out and chased the men down the mountain jim dixon fired 
four shots before felling the bear as his sons tumbled and ran 
down the mountain screaming for help 
peggy dixon wife and mother of the hunters says the family 
welcomed an investigation 
theyre legal 100 percent she said jim and both boys had 
hunting licenses they had bear tags and theyre residents they 
were on a legitimate hunt 
the dixon story was the topic of local radio callin shows 
peggy dixon says she did not listen but a friend told her the 
comments were mostly negative 
lets get real she said friday night were talking about 
boys a 19yearold and 22yearold whove been hunting all their 
lives and just have some normal curiosity 
thats why they walked up to it all the tracks were leading 
away there were no tracks going into the den 
jim dixon was away on a hunting trip and was not expected back 
until sunday night 
according to a fish and wildlife officer there is nothing in 
state law to prevent anyone defending life or property from killing 
an animal but there are conditions for instance necessity may 
not be brought about by harassment or provocation or by an 
unreasonable investigation of an animals habitat 
killing wildlife under these violations is punishable by a year 
in jail a 1000 fine or both 
one fish and wildlife officer who spoke on condition he not be 
named said that it appeared as if the bear kill was within the law 
longtime bear guide kevin fitzgerald of talkeetna said he 
found the story appalling 
theres no law against hunting a bear in its den fitzgerald 
said legally theyll probably get off if they had tags but 
its the most ridiculous thing ive ever heard

the united states has joined 31 other 
american states in agreeing to step up the war on drugs with 
heavier penalties and improved international cooperation 
despite fridays accord the united states and mexico remained 
at odds over the reported abduction of a mexican doctor to face 
us charges in the killing of a drug agent 
mexico has threatened to stop cooperating with the united states 
in antidrug efforts if more suspects are kidnapped on its 
territory 
the 20point antidrug plan dubbed the declaration of ixtapa 
was signed by the united states mexico and 30 other members of the 
organization of american states or oas 
it calls for better education and prevention starting in grammar 
school greater coordination in police work improvements in 
information exchanges and tougher legislation 
it also calls for stronger measures against money laundering and 
the illegal sale of weapons and explosives it recommends stricter 
controls on lab equipment and chemicals for making drugs 
the declaration includes economic aid through international 
financial institutions led by the inter american development bank 
the program would help farmers substitute legal crops for 
highpaying illicit ones like coca leaf poppies and marijuana no 
figures were given for funding 
latin america is a leading grower and producer of cocaine 
heroin and marijuana the united states is the worlds leading 
consumer and center for money laundering 
experts from the oas nations unanimously concluded in a report 
to justice ministers at the fourday meeting that nowhere is the 
drug problem more serious and pressing than in this hemisphere 
the declaration also called for greater cooperation by 
governments for adequate control of their borders with 
absolute respect for the sovereingty and territorial integrity of 
states 
however the accord made no mention of extraditing suspects from 
one country to another especially to the united states 
extradition has been a touchy issue in latin america in recent 
years exacerbated recently by the alleged abduction of the suspect 
from mexico 
the mexican government has demanded an explanation for what an 
embassy spokesman in washington called the illegal detention of 
dr humberto alvarez machain 
according to news reports bounty hunters seized the 
gynecologist at his guadalajara office on april 2 for a large 
reward offered by the us drug enforcement administration 
alvarez machain was brought to el paso texas the next day and 
arrested 
the doctor is one of 19 mexicans indicted by a federal grand 
jury in los angeles on charges in the 1985 tortureslaying of dea 
agent enrique kiki camarena he is accused of drugging camarena 
while the agent was tortured by his killers 
us attorney general richard thornburgh issued a statement 
friday saying although the drug enforcement administration has 
not completed its investigation of the circumstances surrounding 
the apprehension of dr machain it has been confirmed that no dea 
personnel were present when he was taken into custody in mexico or 
when he was boarded onto an aircraft in that country 
justice department spokesman david runkel said he did not 
foresee any circumstances under which alvarez machain would be 
returned to mexico instead of facing trial in los angeles 
an official at mexicos foreign ministry speaking on condition 
of anonymity said it was arrogantly absurd to make such a 
statement 
mexicos attorney general in a meeting wednesday with 
thornburgh threatened to withhold mexican cooperation in drug 
matters if it were determined the doctor was kidnapped at the deas 
behest

jerome butler who ordered his lawyers 
to stop their appeals and told fellow inmates he would wait for 
them in hell was executed early today for the 1986 murder of a 
taxi driver 
butler appeared relaxed as witnesses filed into the death 
chamber i just want to say i wish everybody a good life and 
things like that he said everything is ok 
then he nodded to the prison warden and a chaplain standing 
nearby coughed several times and stopped breathing he was 
pronounced dead at 1226 am cdt 11 minutes after a lethal 
injection was administered 
this is what ive been waiting for for this moment to know 
this man cannot take away another wifes husband and childrens 
father robbie oakley the widow of slain cab driver nathan 
oakley of houston said friday 
we feel pretty badly about this vic pecorino one of 
butlers attorneys said before the execution jerome butler is 
not your typical maddog killer 
without cooperation from him what are you going to appeal 
an inmate whose cell is near butlers on the texas death row 
said butler had been prepared to die for weeks 
he said he doesnt want to be among the walking dead said 
raymond carl kinnamon hes happy as a lark on easter sunday but 
hes definitely said hes going to hell he said ill wait for 
you in hell 
attorney general jim mattox who witnessed the execution said 
prison officials offered butler 54 a last chance to seek a stay 
he indicated he wanted to go on forward mattox said 
he had indicated he simply did not want to live in prison and get 
out a very old man if he would not be executed 
prosecutors said butler may have shot to death oakley 67 in 
june 1986 because the driver recognized butler as the man who 
killed his friend ac johnson in 1973 butler served 10 years of 
a 30year prison term for that slaying 
altogether he spent 27 years behind bars beginning with 13 
years at sing sing prison in new york beginning in 1959 for 
robbery attempted sexual assault and accessory to rape 
 
the year after his release he was arrested for the johnson 
slaying and sentenced to 30 years he got out of prison in 1984 
two years later he was on death row 
butler had passed competency tests so appeals on psychological 
grounds could not be raised 
i just want to get it over with he said last month when his 
execution date was set 
he told attorneys that even if he won a new trial and received a 
life sentence he would be well into his 70s before he would 
become eligible for parole 
what am i supposed to do then go live under a bridge he 
asked 
butler became the 34th inmate and the oldest to be executed in 
texas since the state resumed capital punishment in 1982 the total 
is the highest of any state 
he was the 122nd inmate executed in the united states since the 
supreme court in 1976 allowed states to resume the death penalty

national lawmakers have approved a 
change in the countrys official name to satisfy slovak demands for 
greater recognition 
the new name the czech and slovak federative republic was 
approved friday in a vote by both houses of parliament but only 
after an inconclusive first ballot 
the vote in the house of the people was 13320 with eight 
abstentions in the house of nations 102 of the 149 deputies 
supported the new name the number of opposing votes and 
abstentions in that tally was not available 
the legislation needed a twothirds majority in both chambers 
legislator vaclav benda said the necessary majority was not 
achieved in a first round of balloting and a second vote was taken 
after a recess 
the name change took effect immediately it was the second in 
less than a month 
parliament renamed the country the czechoslovak federative 
republic on march 23 replacing the word socialist with 
federative to symbolize the countrys shedding of its communist 
past 
parliament then permitted the slovaks to refer to the country as 
the czechoslovak federative republic to underline the separate 
identities of the two republics that make up the nation 
but slovaks who account for a third of czechoslovakias 155 
million people demanded their identity be specified more clearly 
in the new name 
thousands of slovaks demonstrated in march in bratislava the 
slovak capital protesting over the countrys name and demanding an 
independent slovak state 
in a new rally for independence more than 2000 people gathered 
late friday in bratislava the peaceful protest was organized by 
the movement of the national council for the liberation of 
slovakia which wants a referendum on the issue by the end of this 
year

the worlds largest drug company says it 
will start offering discount drugs to medicaid patients a move 
long opposed by the pharmaceutical industry 
merck amp co announced its plan as congress and medicaid 
officials in several states sought to force drug price reductions 
but merck will offer the seven to 12 percent savings only in 
states that drop restrictions barring medicaid reimbursement to 
doctors who prescribe the companys most expensive drugs said tony 
fiskett spokesman for merck sharpe amp dohne the rahway companys 
west point pennbased pharmaceutical division 
about 24 states now restrict which drugs qualify for medicaid 
often allowing reimbursement only for lowercost generic drugs 
ronald nordmann an analyst at paine webber securities said the 
plan announced thursday is a very clever program that would 
bring increases in purchases of merck products 
fiskett said the lower prices will fall between the drugs price 
to wholesalers and its cost to large volume buyers including 
federal agencies like the us department of veterans affairs 
which already receive significant discounts 
the purpose of the plan is to preserve the ability of doctors 
to use those medicines that they choose for their patients and to 
ensure medicaid patients can receive the same costeffective 
medicine available to the general public fiskett said 
currently about 24 states including new york california and 
massachusetts limit which drugs qualify for medicaid payments 
merck claims these restrictions unfairly prevent doctors from 
prescribing some of its most expensive drugs to medicaid patients 
fiskett said merck has been planning to put a costreducing 
program into effect for years but many circumstances including the 
rising cost of medicaid finally prompted the company to act this 
year 
we are trying to be responsive to the needs of physicians 
patients and the states fiskett said there was no particular 
sticking point its just that over time we decided that this is 
the responsible thing to do and the fair thing to do 
merck predicts the savings will be millions per year per state 
fiskett said he said the price reductions should take effect by 
july 1 after all the states have had time to review the plan and 
make a decision 
merck makes vasotec for reducing blood pressure mevacor for 
lowering cholesterol and pepcid which treats ulcers 
medicaid purchases amount to about 300 million of mercks 3 
billion in annual american pharmaceutivcal sales said dr john l 
zabriskie president of merck sharpe amp dohne

police and organizers of a rally by haitians and 
african americans to protest aids policies had expected 10000 
people but an extra 40000 flooded lower manhattan and coaxed 
mayor david dinkins out as well 
the fda is wrong he shouted attracting a scream of delight 
from the crowd i predict theyre going to reverse themselves 
the march friday was in protest of a food and drug 
administration policy prohibiting anyone who has emigrated from 
haiti or certain african countries from giving blood as a 
precaution against spreading aids 
later dinkins prediction came true as a federal aids advisory 
committee in washington recommended that the governments ban on 
blood donations be eased for people who have been screened for the 
deadly virus 
the recommendation supported by three of the panels five 
members will be considered immediately by the food and drug 
administration said dr paul parkman the agencys aids 
coordinator 
dr joel l solomon director of the fdas division of blood and 
blood products said in a statement that the emigres have been 
excluded from giving blood because the aidsrelated virus is 
endemic and is transmitted largely through heterosexual activity in 
their countries making it difficult to tell in advance who would 
and would not have the virus 
before noon friday the crowd swelled quickly as protesters 
gathered in downtown brooklyn and crossed the brooklyn bridge 
which was closed for more than two hours 
lt raymond odonnell a police spokesman said the police 
estimate was 20000 people at 1230 pm and more than 50000 an 
hour later at the scheduled start of a rally at federal plaza 
this is unbelievable he said 
two serious injuries were reported when a motorist caught in the 
huge crowd got into an argument with some of the demonstrators 
said another police spokesman sgt ed burns 
there were no arrests 
a press notice announcing the demonstration stated it was 
sponsored by a coalition of students community groups and clergy 
organizations called the haitian enforcement against racism 
several people carried a large black coffin through the crowd 
printed on it was aids is a us government germ warfare 
another sign read scientists created aids to kill black 
population 
about 16 percent of all aids cases in the united states are 
among haitians many of the haitian immigrants live in florida and 
new york

the foster mother of an aidsinfected 5yearold 
boy said she bore no grudge against a church that barred the child 
from sunday school classes but lifted the ban after it drew 
criticism 
terry and walt rucker said late friday they welcome the 
opportunity to take their son back to moody church 
i think more than anything i felt disappointment when all 
this happened mrs rucker said in a telephone interview i 
dont feel any bitterness 
earlier mrs rucker had said this is a bibleteaching church 
and they cannot justify their fears 
news of the nondenominational evangelical churchs original 
decision broke late thursday less than two weeks after the april 8 
death of ryan white an indiana teenager who fought to end 
discrimination against aids victims 
the ban sparked criticism from the american civil liberties 
union the ruckers and aids activists four of whom protested 
outside the church friday 
at a news conference friday afternoon the rev erwin lutzer 
the churchs senior pastor announced the ban was lifted 
referring to the child by a fictitious name lutzer said we 
love joey and we want joey back in our sunday school and joey 
will be back in our sunday school 
lutzer said other childrens parents would be told a child with 
aids would be attending sunday school and they will have the 
freedom to keep their children from the class 
our position and our concerns have not changed lutzer said 
we have decided to shift the burden of responsibility from us as 
a church to the parents 
rucker said the churchs original ban had surprised him adding 
we thought with ryan white all that had been settled 
lutzer said the original ban was intended only to give us time 
to think the situation through 
he said he didnt expect a mass exodus from the class of about 
15 children and said the church already welcomes aids victims to 
its sanctuary services 
john hammell director of the aids and civil liberties project 
of the american civil liberties union of illinois said the 
decision to bar the boy seemed to violate laws prohibiting 
discrimination against the handicapped 
rucker a psychologist and his wife a nurse took joey in when 
his mother who also had aids became too sick to care for him 
aids is caused by a virus transmitted mainly through sexual 
intercourse shared hypodermic needles and from infected mothers to 
their infants before or during birth it has no known cure

an advance crew began work in two 
environmentally sensitive areas in prince william sound 10 days 
before exxon corp was to resume its general cleanup of the exxon 
valdez oil spill 
the work is aimed at enhancing conditions for commercial fishing 
and providing protection for wildlife spring migration into the 
sound the company said 
a ship left seward on friday to work on areas that may need 
attention before the general cleanup resumes may 1 because they may 
be closed later due to wildlife activity exxon spokesman joe 
tucker in anchorage said 
workers today were spreading absorbent booms in the waters off 
knight and latouche islands which include sea bird rookeries and 
areas where seals and sea lions haul out 
as other sites needing cleanup are identified by company and 
federal officials they will initially do manual pickup of oily 
debris tucker said 
the ship carried nine contract employees an exxon supervisor 
two boom deployment specialists and observers from the us coast 
guard and the state department of environmental conservation 
tucker said 
the crews wont necessarily hit the beaches he said this 
is not the start of the main summer cleanup this is just an 
advance squad 
hundreds of miles of shoreline in prince william sound were 
fouled when the tanker exxon valdez ran aground on a charted reef 
on march 24 1989 the reef shredded the tankers hull releasing 
nearly 11 million gallons of north slope crude oil into the water 
it was the nations biggest oil spill killing hundreds of 
otters and thousands of birds and other animals 
exxon said it spent more than 2 billion in last summers 
cleanup campaign hiring over 10000 workers and leasing more than 
1000 boats for the operation 
the oil giant said winter storms scoured clean many of the 
beaches and it plans a greatly reduced operation this year

the columbia astronauts are waiting 
in the shadow of next weeks discovery flight before they are given 
the goahead to fly into space with their astronomy laboratory 
while the seven columbia astronauts have been preparing for 
their nineday flight to observe ultraviolet rays and xrays in 
deep space the spotlight has been on discoverys mission to deploy 
the 15 billion hubble space telescope that mission was delayed 
by two weeks but liftoff is scheduled for tuesday morning 
we joke around that if they dont get out of the way well 
run over them said columbia commander vance brand whose mission 
is scheduled for a may 9 blastoff 
discovery is poised on one launch pad at cape canaveral fla 
and columbia was scheduled sunday to be rolled out to another pad 
16 miles away 
two shuttles have not been on separate pads simultaneously since 
january 1986 when challenger was moved to the pad while columbia 
was awaiting launch challenger exploded 10 days after columbia 
landed 
while the columbia astronauts gave their preflight press 
conference friday at houstons johnson space center technicians at 
cape canaveral were installing hubbles powerful batteries in 
preparation for launch 
the batteries will power the telescope from the time it is 
disconnected from discoverys power system until its 
energycollecting solar panels are unfurled in space 
hubble once in orbit 380 miles above earth will be capable of 
detecting objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater 
clarity than the best groundbased observatory 
the columbia crew will carry the 100 million astro observatory 
into space to observe and measure ultraviolet radiation from 
objects in space without interference from the earths atmosphere 
the four astronomers on the crew hope the three ultraviolet 
instruments and the board band xray will shed light on galaxies 
black holes and quasars 
we think this has tremendous science potential brand said 
on friday the columbia astronauts noted that their observatory 
should be able to relay information to the ground first even 
though hubble will get to space sooner 
we will be sending down science data while space telescope is 
still doing engineering checkout and so we should be able to beat 
them to the punch on getting down the first science data said 
mission specialist robert parker 
for the first time since the challenger accident two payload 
specialists will fly into space aboard columbia ronald parise and 
samuel durrance will be operating the telescopes along with mission 
specialists jeffrey hoffman and parker the observatory will be in 
the shuttles cargo bay but will be operated by the astronauts in 
the shuttle cabin 
parise is a senior scientist in the space observatories 
department at the computer sciences corp in silver spring md 
durrance is a research scientist in the physics and astronomy 
department at john hopkins university 
pilot guy gardner and flight engineer john m mike lounge 
will be in charge of maneuvering the orbiter so the telescopes can 
be aimed at different points in space 
even though the hubble mission has been getting most of the 
media attention hoffman said the two flights are not in 
competition he said he teases the discovery crew members saying 
hell get the chance to work as a space astronomer for more than a 
week 
all they do is throw out a telescope anybody can do that 
hoffman joked

fire ripped through the upper floor of a 
fivestory hotel before dawn today sending 150 sleepy guests 
scurrying to safety near the glittering las vegas strip 
authorities said 
three people were treated for minor smoke inhalation in the fire 
at the las vegas inn but no serious injuries were reported and no 
one was believed trapped in the hotel officials said 
early warnings allowed nearly all 150 guests in the 75room 
hotel to evacuate the hotel without injury city spokesman doug 
bradford said 
we believe the fire started in the attic bradford said 
we were able to keep the fire on the roof and top floor the 
fire broke out about 230 am and was brought under control nearly 
three hours later 
the building was equipped with sprinklers in accordance with a 
state law enacted following the mgm grand hotel fire that killed 87 
in november 1980 bradford said he added that the sprinklers 
definitely saved lives and probably saved the entire building 
tina gutierrez 26 of los angeles was asleep on the fourth 
floor when warnings first sounded 
i woke up to find the fire alarm going off she said it 
went off thank goodness i opened the door and there was black 
smoke 
two smoke victims were treated and released from valley 
hospital said nursing supervisor eleanor jakobs a third was 
treated and released from university medical center according to a 
nursing supervisor who said hospital policy prevented him from 
giving his name 
bradford said a couple of other people were treated at the scene 
for minor cuts or smoke problems 
the cause of the fire was not immediately determined 
scores of onlookers lined the street as firefighters rained 
water on the blaze

a newspaper that often reflects the views 
of irans president today urged proiranian hostagetakers in 
lebanon to hasten talks to free an american captive 
the tehran times said it hoped the release of one captive could 
be the prelude to the release of one more hostage by another 
group 
the editorial was the latest in a series of hostage developments 
that began wednesday when one lebanese group holding three 
american educators said it would release one hostage by friday 
however the islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine said 
thursday it had indefinitely postponed the release it blamed the 
delay on the refusal of the united states to send a senior diplomat 
to damascus as the group demanded 
a shiite moslem cleric reputed to have influence over the 
kidnappers hussain musawi said friday by telephone from his 
headquarters in the eastern lebanese town of baalbek that freedom 
for a hostage was certain despite the delays 
asked when he expected the release to take place musawi said 
that depends on how farsighted the americans might become so 
far their behavior is arrogant and one of cowboy mentality 
musawi heads islamic amal a faction within the proiranian 
hezbollah group that advocates strong links with syria 
hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella for shiite moslem 
groups holding most of the 18 western hostages in lebanon 
thousands of hezbollah members joined a military parade friday 
through beiruts southern slums two blocks from where many of the 
hostages are believed held 
syria has said it is working to free one by sunday 
in damascus officials have met frequently with us ambassador 
edward djerejian since he returned to the syrian capital thursday 
the islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine had demanded 
the united states send john kelly the assistant secretary of state 
for near eastern affairs to damascus for final coordination of the 
release he was the ambassador to lebanon from 1986 to 1988 and he 
conducted secret hostage negotiations in what became known as the 
irancontra affair 
in washington kelly said djerejian was in damascus and fully 
capable of handling all the details of bringing a hostage out 
safely and quickly and efficiently 
you know american policy is that we do not make concessions to 
those who hold the hostages kelly said in a statement we want 
the hostages out but we are not going to bow to the demands of the 
hostageholders 
the englishlanguage tehran times said the kidnappers should 
consider djerejians presence good enough to conduct the 
arrangements for the release of the hostage 
it repeated an appeal first made in february for freedom of 
all hostages without any conditions and immediately 
hurdles there may be on the way but it is our hope that 
despite all the freedom of the hostages can become a reality 
materializing soon said the newspaper considered close to 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani 
the islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine holds alann 
steen a native of boston who turns 51 on sunday jesse turner 42 
of boise idaho and robert polhill 55 of new york 
it had not said which of the three it had considered freeing 
they were kidnapped from the campus of the usaffiliated 
beirut university college on jan 24 1987 by gunmen disguised as 
riot police 
eight americans are among the 18 westerners held in lebanon the 
longestheld is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for 
the associated press he was kidnapped in beirut on march 16 1985 
west german hostage heinrich struebig turned 49 in captivity 
today 
struebig a relief worker with the german organization 
asmehumanitas was kidnapped may 16 1989 near the south lebanon 
city of sidon along with a german colleague 28yearold thomas 
kemptner no group has claimed responsibility for their abduction 
relatives of two hostages said friday in damascus they were 
optimistic 
the mood seems to be as if the hostage issue the hostage 
file will be finally closed said feryal polhill the wife of 
robert polhill 
i would like president bush not to spare any effort to free 
all the hostages added mrs polhill who is lebanese 
hala elkhazen sisterinlaw of jesse turner said she brought 
a suitcase full of his clothes with her to damascus

lithuania shut most of its factories 
today to save fuel and raw materials in the face of an expanding 
embargo by moscow to break the independence drive a top government 
official said 
leaders of the republic which declared independence march 11 
said they were still searching for a compromise to end the standoff 
but that no firm proposals were under discussion 
on friday the kremlin tightened its vise on lithuania by 
expanding its energy embargo to other products and soviet troops 
stormed a printing plant and beat at least 13 people lithuanians 
said 
today is a regular workday under normal circumstances but 
deputy premier romualdas ozolas said the majority of factories were 
shut 
we decided not to waste our strength while it is not 
necessary ozolas said in an interview 
since wednesday moscow has cut off all oil and about 80 percent 
of the natural gas supply to lithuania officials said friday that 
supplies of some food products tires cable and other goods also 
were curtailed 
traffic on the streets of vilnius the lithuanian capital was 
greatly reduced today a rationing plan limits drivers to about 7 
gallons of gasoline a month 
ozolas said some lithuanian factories probably would have to 
close starting monday because of shortages of fuel and raw 
materials however he said the neighboring baltic republic of 
estonia was offering aid and an agreement probably would be 
reached late today 
president vytautus landsbergis speaking to reporters at the 
opening of a meeting by the proindependence sajudis movement said 
lithuania was searching for a compromise with moscow but there 
were no proposals on the table 
asked about reports that moscow was offering to negotiate if 
lithuania delayed independence for two years he said we havent 
received any kind of proposal 
we havent debated this he said but he also said some 
compromise ideas had been raised in contacts through middlemen he 
would not give details 
landsbergis was quoted as saying friday that a twoyear 
moratorium on full independence could form part of a compromise 
if somebody authorized by moscow to negotiate presented us 
with a package of proposals including this we could have a 
discussion the new york times quoted him as saying in todays 
editions 
however he also reportedly said lithuania would not agree to 
put itself under the authority of the soviet constitution 
ozolas landsbergis and estonian premier edgar savisaar 
conferred informally saturday morning during a break in the sajudis 
session 
savisaar recalling that lithuanian civilians were beaten by 
soviet soldiers who occupied a vilnius printing plant friday told 
the congress what happened in vilnius yesterday could happen in 
tallin tomorrow estonians understand this and are ready to share 
the hardships 
the baltic republics of lithuania latvia and estonia were 
forcibly annexed by the soviet union in 1940 despite the soviet 
military and economic pressure lithuania has refused to back off 
its declaration of independence and has sought western material and 
political support 
president mikhail s gorbachev has refused to negotiate unless 
lithuania rescinds the declaration 
in birmingham ala where president bush addressed a political 
rally spokesman marlin fitzwater said the white house is 
increasingly concerned by reports of the economic crackdown on 
lithuania and that bush will brief congress early next week on 
possible retaliation 
lithuanians produce more meat and milk than they consume and 
they are in no danger of serious food shortages 
however lithuanias communist party chief algirdas brazauskas 
said the republics 38 million people must compromise on its 
proindependence decisions or face critical shortages of oil and 
natural gas in two weeks 
in two weeks we will have a critical situation brazauskas 
told the lithuanian parliament the price for independence must 
have limits 
lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene today traveled to 
copenhagen for talks with danish officials she was in norway on 
friday discussing how to obtain oil at worldmarket prices instead 
of lowcost oil for soviet rubles she offered to trade lithuanian 
dairy products 
armed soldiers stormed a communist party printing plant in 
vilnius during the afternoon and beat at least 13 people witnesses 
said 
there has been almost no violence during the standoff with 
moscow even though soviet soldiers have previously occupied 
several party and public buildings soviet forces have also dragged 
some deserters back to the military 
lithuanian legislator zigmas vaisvilas said civilian guards 
arrived friday at the plant which already was occupied by a few 
interior ministry troops without weapons 
the soviet news agency tass said the colonel in charge asked the 
civilians to leave and called in reinforcements when they refused 
helmeted soviet soldiers carrying automatic weapons and 
truncheons arrived in two trucks entered the building and beat 
some of the civilians said witness angele guobiene who works for 
the trade union journal darbas ir poilsis which is printed at the 
plant 
soviet authorities let about two dozen foreign correspondents 
return to lithuania until sunday after expelling virtually all of 
them from the republic on april 1

japan will soon run out of room to stash its trash 
the government said saturday 
the problem is a disease of extravagance said tetsuo 
hayakawa spokesman for the health and welfare ministrys 
environmental affairs division people are throwing away 
everything even things still good enough to use 
the mountainous island nation comparable in size to california 
created 483 million tons of trash in 1988 39 percent more than 
the year before the health and welfare ministry said it rushed to 
compile the data months ahead of schedule in time for international 
earth day sunday 
the volume of trash produced by the nations industries and 120 
million people was enough to fill japans largest stadium the 
tokyo dome 130 times over the ministry said 
hayakawa said that if the japanese continue wasting resources at 
the current pace they will create more than 60 million tons of 
trash by 1994 and there will not be enough space to bury it 
he blamed the wasteful use of computer paper in offices and 
consumers growing use of disposable products such as plastic 
bottles and even cameras 
in addition people are buying new home appliances and throwing 
out old refrigerators televisions and the like in vast numbers he 
said 
in tokyo japans largest city paper from offices accounts for 
about 42 percent of the citys trash while kitchen garbage makes 
up 37 percent plastics metals glass and other materials account 
for the rest 
aside from landfill disposal tokyo uses 13 incineration plants 
to get rid of trash but these are able to handle only 80 percent 
of the citys burnable trash hayakawa said adding that the 
problem is similar in many other parts of the country

president bush is believed ready to sign a 
bill requiring the government to keep track of hate crimes 
against minorities but the sponsor says the program could be 
torpedoed by a budget squeeze at the fbi 
the implementation of the landmark hate crimes legislation 
will be severely hampered if the staff responsible for 
administering the law at the fbi is reduced rep charles 
schumer dny said 
schumer made his comment came friday after the fbi acknowledged 
that it is considering a proposal to discontinue its uniform crime 
report an annual count of crimes in america 
under the recently approved hate crimes bill the justice 
department is to keep statistics on offenses related to race 
religion sexual orientation and ethnicity as part of the uniform 
crime report 
approval of the hate crimes bill followed complaints about a 
wave of such offenses on the part of neonazi skinheads and other 
bigot groups a 1988 justice department report however said no 
such statistics were available 
the bush administration supported the measure which was 
sponsored in the house by schumer and the president was expected 
to sign it this week 
fbi officials however told schumer at a hearing thursday that 
a budget squeeze was draining manpower from their 
statisticsgathering staff 
they said a proposal that would in effect eliminate the 
60yearold crime reports was under consideration by the records 
management division as a way to help absorb the manpower cuts 
fbi officials said a longstanding drive by the office of 
management and budget to slash payroll and channel work to private 
contractors was responsible for much of the reduction in manpower 
they said the records division has lost 258 positions since 1987 
and plans call for elimination of 92 more the division has more 
than 1100 employees 
special agent j harper wilson in charge of the uniform crime 
reports said his staff might be spared the brunt of the cuts but 
would have to absorb at least 30 and more likely far more than that 
schumer issued a statement friday saying that at a time when 
information on overall crime is woefully thin the bush 
administration should be moving forcefully to bolster its 
understanding of crime not undermining it i hope the president 
personally intervenes to prevent these cutbacks 
without it his signing into law of the hate crimes measure 
would be little more than an empty gesture he added 
schumer also sent a letter to attorney general dick thornburgh 
saying that a large staff cut would eviscerate the bureaus 
ability to collect and distribute the uniform crime reports 
the justice department also maintains a separate datagathering 
arm the bureau of justice statistics

chadian forces attacked libyanbacked 
rebels for the second time in three days killing 103 guerrillas 
and taking 45 prisoner the army claimed saturday 
the fighting took place friday along the countrys eastern 
border with sudan in a reconnaissance operation following a battle 
wednesday that left 517 rebels dead the high command reported 
there was no mention of government losses 
a television journalist accompanying the chadian troops said 
rebel commanders moussa haroun and youssouf adoum were among the 
prisoners 
chadian forces seized 27 pickup trucks equipped with multiple 
rocket launchers machine guns or light cannon and destroyed 28 
similar vehicles the statement said numerous small arms were also 
captured 
the frequency and ferocity of these battles demonstrates the 
excessive demented obstinacy of tripoli the statement said 
chad says libya supplies the rebel group called the legion 
with arms and training libya denies the organization exists 
the rebels normally cross into western chad from bases in the 
lightly populated darfur province in eastern sudan where the 
khartoum government exercises virtually no control 
renewed fighting in the sporadic civil war broke out last month 
when rebels took government outposts at bahai and tine chadian 
troops later recaptured the positions 
the battles have caused france to reinforce its garrisons in 
eastern chad with 146 paratroopers a second transport aircraft and 
a military surgical unit france had been stationing about 1000 
troops in its former african colony 
libya which once occupied most of northern chad was chased out 
three years ago in a series of defeats tripoli still claims as its 
own a strip of land on chads northern border the aouzou strip 
in a peace agreement signed last september libya and chad 
reconfirmed their ceasefire agreed to the exchange of prisoners 
of war and to submitting their territorial dispute to international 
arbitration

lech walesa turned back two challengers 
today to win reelection as chairman of solidarity the union that 
toppled communist hardliners but is losing popularity while the 
country makes the painful switch to capitalism 
some members had claimed walesa was undemocratic in his manner 
of running solidarity 
walesa the shipyard electrician who has held the top job since 
solidaritys birth received 775 percent of the valid votes the 
unions election commission said 
delegates to the unions second national congress welcomed the 
announcement of the results by chanting leszek leszek leszek 
a diminutive form of walesas first name 
the election for chairman took place on the third day of the 
congress which is meeting in this baltic port city the birthplace 
of solidarity during a nationwide strike wave in august 1980 
the congress scheduled to end tuesday is expected to outline 
the unions stand on the economic reform program of the 
solidarityled government the reform is aimed at bringing the 
moribund economy back to life and transforming it from communist 
central planning to a marketoriented system but it has thrown 
about 200000 people out of work 
the delegates selecting a leader to shape the unions role in 
postcommunist poland cast 362 balllots for walesa 52 for veteran 
activist andrzej slowik and 25 for tomasz wojcik a littleknown 
local strike leader 
i am very happy but i am aware of what a cross a union cross 
a polish cross we are to bear walesa told the congress after 
his victory 
whats before us is even more difficult than what is behind us 
we shall not waste the heritage of generations he said 
walesas reelection comes at a time when recent public opinion 
polls show the union losing popularity due to the solidarityled 
governments austerity measures walesa who won the nobel peace 
prize in 1983 for his leadership of solidarity remains popular 
internal union tensions including charges that walesas methods 
are undemocratic have surfaced during the congress debates but 
none of solidaritys bestknown activists decided to challenge the 
charismatic walesa 
walesa himself proposed the candidacy of slowik a bus driver 
and union leader from the central city of lodz who has often 
advocated a more militant course for solidarity slowik opposed any 
concessions to the communists during the negotiations that led to 
the relegalization of solidarity in april 1989 after a sevenyear 
ban 
wojcik the other candidate is a chemist who helped lead 1988 
strikes against the thencommunist government in the wroclaw region 
of southwest poland 
solidaritybacked candidates swept partially free parliamentary 
elections nearly a year ago and took control of the government from 
the communists installing tadeusz mazowiecki a former union 
adviser as the east blocs first noncommunist prime minister 
walesa on friday rebuffed former union leaders who have charged 
him with undemocratic leadership on friday walesa won a vote of 
confidence from the delegates after delivering an impassioned 
defense of his 10 years as union chairman 
i am not the wisest guy but we are wise because we now have a 
democracy he said in an emotional address 
delegates responded by voting 3571 in favor of a report on his 
leadership since solidaritys last congress in the fall of 1981 
there were 22 abstentions 
some delegates said they saw walesas leadership as essential to 
keeping solidarity together 
only about 22 million of the 10 million members the union 
claimed in 1981 have joined since it won back its legal status a 
year ago

premier li peng begins a trip to moscow monday 
that neither side expects to accomplish much beyond reaffirming the 
resumption of relations declared last may 
both countries preoccupied with domestic issues are eager to 
submerge past hostilities but recognize the limitations of what 
they can offer each other economically or politically 
lis visit will be the first by a chinese leader to the soviet 
union in 26 years he is returning the visit of president mikhail 
s gorbachev who came to beijing in may 1989 for the first 
chinesesoviet summit in three decades 
he is expected to sign a trade agreement which presumably will 
have limited significance as the two countries move away from 
planned barter toward paying for goods in hard currency 
soviet sources said the two sides also would adopt principles 
for reducing military confrontation along their 4300mile border 
but there would be no specifics on troop withdrawals 
trade has increased steadily since tensions began to ease in the 
mid1980s and reached the equivalent of 28 billion last year 
that still is less than chinas trade with taiwan or south 
korea both anticommunist states chinese trade policy is based on 
exporting to the west to obtain hard currency for technology and 
machinery only the west can supply 
politically its a different world from 1960 when the two 
communist giants split over ideology 
in a recent interview with soviet reporters li said there is 
no perfect model for developing socialism he pledged that 
relations would continue even if the soviets think socialism is 
no longer the ideal system but said he saw no signs of the 
soviet union veering from the socialist road 
traditional suspicions have deepened in the past year however 
as the soviet union pursues reform while chinas aging marxists 
after crushing the democracy movement dig in for a long 
ideological siege 
they dont openly criticize us a soviet official said 
but god knows what they do in private 
it is said that senior leader deng xiaoping called gorbachev a 
revisionist in an internal report and that chinese leaders are 
appalled by the soviet communist partys renunciation of monopoly 
rule 
analysts say longstanding differences rule out any kind of 
alliance against the united states one western diplomat was asked 
about the strategic significance of lis trip to moscow and 
responded who the hell cares 
lis trip should be much smoother than the one in 1964 when 
premier chou enlai met with leonid i brezhnev and alexei kosygin 
in moscow 
chou sat silently when others applauded brezhnevs reference to 
detente with the west and snubbed his hosts by laying a wreath on 
the tomb of stalin who was still a hero in china 
differences over cambodia the dismantling of communism in 
eastern europe and increased soviet contacts with taiwan probably 
will be kept private during this visit 
the chinese premier who studied engineering in the soviet union 
in the 1950s and speaks some russian can point to real progress in 
relations during the past year 
highlevel party and military contacts have resumed and chinas 
communist party newspaper soon will reopen its moscow office which 
was closed 30 years ago the two countries now have 1200 exchange 
students compared to 10 in 1983 
xinhua the official chinese news agency said the visit will 
have profound significance for peace in asia and the world it 
also will give the two old adversaries some peace of mind so they 
can tend to problems at home

conventional wisdom says 1990 is not a good 
year to run for office as an antiabortion candidate but dont 
tell that to the national right to life committee 
the group is running highprofile campaigns for a number of 
candidates despite defections by former supporters polls that show 
most voters are prochoice and the possibility its efforts may 
galvanize the opposition 
the committee is getting a wary welcome from some prolife 
candidates who fear they may alienate voters if they emphasize 
their opposition to abortion 
florida gov bob martinez who called a special legislative 
session on abortion but failed to push through a single 
antiabortion bill was honored last week at a right to life rally 
attended by 10000 abortion opponents 
the governors pollster david b hill said the group just 
happened to be meeting in tallahassee he would not have taken 
a whole day to see them if it had been in miami this is not a 
priority 
when right to life scheduled newspaper and radio ads earlier 
this year for penny pullen an ardent antiabortion veteran in the 
illinois legislature she asked that they be canceled 
she didnt want to be perceived as a singleissue candidate 
said sandra faucher director of right to lifes political action 
committee pullen lost the gop primary by 31 votes and awaits a 
recount 
its unclear whether pullens race demonstrates the folly of 
rejecting ones antiabortion allies as faucher claims but it 
does illustrate the ambivalence the righttolife movement is up 
against at the same time the national abortion rights action league 
is basking in sudden popularity 
we used to have to slip in through the back door said naral 
executive director kate michelman now candidates are coming to 
us and we cant be in all the places we want to be 
sen tom harkin diowa returned a 10000 contribution from 
naral in 1984 this year hes gone out of his way to contrast his 
prochoice views with the strict antiabortion stand held by his 
opponent gop rep tom tauke 
naral is spending thousands of dollars on an independent 
campaign against tauke with no discouragement from harkin 
prochoice candidates have been putting more emphasis on their 
support for abortion rights since the supreme court last year gave 
states more authority to restrict abortion the ruling energized 
prochoice voters and gave them a few electoral victories putting 
some muscle behind polls showing a majority of americans oppose 
government involvement in the issue 
faucher and her prolife allies lately have been shifting focus 
from their ultimate goal of a constitutional amendment outlawing 
abortion to less sweeping proposals that a majority of americans 
appear to support the committee is stressing opposition to 
taxpayerfunded sexselection and lateterm abortions and pushing 
parental notification requirements 
you have to deal with what is possible legislatively 
faucher said roe vs wade has not been overturned you cannot 
ban abortions anywhere 
the prochoice side sees this as backpedaling theyve 
retreated said harrison hickman who does polling for naral 
when the other side has more soldiers than you do a retreat is 
dealing with reality 
narals michelman predicts the strategy wont work 
the other side doesnt understand the polls she said 
when it comes to elections what the voter wants to know is do 
you support the legal right of a woman to have an abortion 
both sides contend the oppositions advertising mailings and 
phone bank efforts are counterproductive and invite a backlash 
faucher cites a naral ad suggesting that iowa women could end up 
with fewer rights than romanian women under prolifers such as 
tauke gov terry branstad and democratic gubernatorial hopeful tom 
miller 
she said the ad was so radical and extreme that the people of 
iowa are just going to shuck that off as crazy feminists 
on the other side harkins camp welcomed a right to life ad 
campaign attacking his abortion position saying they expected it 
to help harkin more than tauke if the antichoice forces want to 
attack us on that issue thats fine said harkins political 
director phil roeder 
despite all the sound and fury from both sides some strategists 
believe neither side will make an impact hill who does polling 
for both brandstad and floridas martinez is one of them 
its beyond imagination that there would be an ad that would 
awaken somebody for the first time to what the governors point of 
view is hill said of martinez as for branstad he said his 
position is so wellknown its already gone to the bottom line 
and his approval ratings are above 60 percent

the struggle by world war i veterans for a 
small pension makes it seem as if the trench fighting never stopped 
each year brings a new assault on a seemingly impregnable 
position known as capitol hill each new wave is smaller as those 
who escaped bullets gas influenza and shrapnel are felled by time 
more than 45 million americans served from 1917 to 1918 2 
million over there with gen john j pershings american 
expeditionary force half a million or more risked their lives 
elsewhere making the world safe for democracy according to the 
organization veterans of world war i 
but these veterans the few that are left complain that they 
never were recognized for their service the way other veterans 
were they say they were underpaid compared with their civilian 
counterparts who profited from war production and the depression 
devoured the meager benefits they were able to squeeze out of a 
prostrate economy 
most were too old and settled by the end of world war ii to take 
advantage of the array of housing educational and other benefits 
offered in the gi bill of rights 
so they tried again last week 
please help us over the top don r pears 90 of buchanan 
mich said at a joint hearing of the house and senate veterans 
affairs committees 
after receiving a brief extension of his allotted time to 
testify pears askedhow many minutes do i have 
not too many 
five years ago the world war i veterans were 171000 strong in 
march 1989 there were 111000 this past march there were 90000 
and their average age was close to 95 
threequarters of the veterans are in hospitals or nursing 
homes and the department of veterans affairs estimates that by the 
turn of the century there will be 7000 left by the year 2010 
fewer than 500 
some world war i veterans receive pensions based upon illness or 
poverty but the veterans group seeks passage of any of the 
perennial handful of bills that would grant either a 10000 lump 
sum or 150 a month for veterans simply because they served in the 
war a smaller amount would go to widows over age 80 
several measures to provide a nonneedsbased world war i 
pension have been introduced in previous years sen alan 
cranston dcalif and chairman of the senate veterans committee 
says in a form letter to constituents however favorable action 
has not been taken because of the great costs involved 
cranston says poor or sick world war i veterans their widows or 
both receive a pension that exceeds by 1530 a year the normal va 
pension for veterans of other wars 
the wwi veterans have gained at least one vocal ally in 
congress rep glenn m anderson dcalif last month delivered a 
long speech on the house floor in favor of hr 1918 one of the 
pension bills picking up about 25 more sponsors to bring the total 
to 100 anderson also wrote a letter last week to president bush 
calling attention to the veterans 
doughboys were paid 1 a day and received 60 to muster out 
they also won bonus payments over the vetoes of presidents 
coolidge and roosevelt 
the first bonus was a 1925 bond redeemable in 1945 congress 
freed the money in the 1930s after veterans marched on washington 
and were routed by their former officers and future world war ii 
heroes gen douglas macarthur and maj george s patton 
by then many of the bonds were in the hands of banks since the 
paper had been used as collateral for loans during lean times says 
muriel sue parkhurst executive director of the veterans group 
that group of men is all gone gilmer t carter 94 of 
winstonsalem nc said referring to the bonus expeditionary 
force as the bonus marchers called themselves 
the old old men who came to washington still act with grace and 
humor they are more prone to talk about the bad food cold nights 
monotony and the absurdities of the soldiers life than 
chateauthierry argonnemeuse or belleau wood 
many who were in washington never got that close to the front 
i was assigned to the general intermediate storage depot 
pears said in an interview the gisd patch he wore however 
came to stand for going insane serving democracy 
nor are any members of the last man clubs who annually 
gather to drink toasts until the last one dies i think all the 
last men are gone already said h louis brooks 91 of toms

president bushs plan for planting a billion 
trees is prompting members of congress to ask why he needs 35 
million to set up a foundation to accomplish that aim 
though no one questions the need for more trees especially in 
urban areas the foundation was described by one congressman as a 
pig in a poke 
i envision that in todays world a lot of consultants would be 
brought in said rep harold volkmer dmo 
volkmer heads the house agriculture subcommittee on forests 
which questioned patricia kearney acting assistant agriculture 
secretary for natural resources last week about the presidents 
plan 
the presidents proposal seeks 175 million annually for five 
years to achieve the goal of planting a billion trees per year she 
said 
of that amount 35 million would be used by a foundation that 
would seek donations for treeplanting from private corporations 
and do promotions to encourage people to reforest kearney said 
though the names of the foundation members have not been 
released a white house spokeswoman said the group would include 20 
to 25 people whose leaders would be announced soon 
the spokeswoman who asked not be identified said white house 
is moving forward with the foundation despite the reluctance being 
voiced by congress 
during questioning by the house kearney said the details of the 
foundation had not been worked out 
that caused volkmer to lean forward and ask do you know what 
a pig in a poke is the phrase refers to buying something you 
cant see 
i never buy one said volkmer 
i think there are some justifiable concerns about the public 
trust rep bruce morrison dconn told kearney 
rep jim olin dva asked why the governments forest service 
couldnt do the work being suggested for the foundation 
kearney said the government couldnt do the private fundraising 
envisioned as a duty of the group the 35 million she said would 
leverage private dollars 
rep jim jontz dind said he supported the presidents plan 
but thought it should be incorporated into legislation he 
introduced that already has passed the house that bill would 
provide the governments technical assistance to those who plant 
trees 
you need a core of people to make sure the trees are being 
taken care of we need to do more to understand the urban 
environment as a habitat for trees jontz said 
john rosenow executive director of the national arbor day 
foundation has other objections 
he said he supports the presidents initiative and likes the 
moneyraising aspect in the proposal but the original proposal 
for the tree trust foundation as drafted would be a duplication of 
the arbor day foundation 
in a telephone interview friday from his lincoln neb office 
rosenow said his organizations 800000 members already work 
nationally with existing groups and agencies throughout the country 
to promote treeplanting 
he is meeting with agriculture secretary clayton yeutter next 
weekend to discuss his concerns he said 
other organizations also are working around the country to get 
more trees in the ground 
fred deneke forest service assistant director for urban 
community forestry said the momentum began to grow about 10 or 12 
years ago 
he said people began to realize that the loss of trees in the 
cities was not only an aesthetic problem but also causing urban 
areas to be hotter a city is often 5 to 9 degrees hotter than 
outlying areas he said 
deneke said street trees can bring down temperatures and 
take some of the burden off air conditioners during the summer 
thereby saving precious fossil fuels but he said only one such 
tree is being planted for every four being lost

lech walesa was reelected as chairman of 
solidarity by an overwhelming margin saturday winning a mandate to 
shape the unions future during the difficult transition from 
communism to capitalism 
in his victory speech walesa said the onceoutlawed union 
cannot rest on its laurels after removing the communists from 
power but must bear responsibility for the countrys future 
i am very happy but i am aware of what a cross a union cross 
a polish cross we are to bear walesa told delegates to 
solidaritys second national congress 
whats before us is even more difficult than what is behind us 
we shall not waste the heritage of generations he said 
delegates welcomed walesas victory over two challengers with 
chants of leszek leszek leszek a diminutive of his first 
name 
walesa the shipyard electrician who has led solidarity since 
its birth in 1980 received 775 percent of the vote the unions 
election commission said 
the delegates selecting a leader to shape the unions role in 
postcommunist poland cast 362 ballots for walesa 52 for veteran 
activist andrzej slowik and 25 for tomasz wojcik a littleknown 
local strike leader 
although walesa was widely expected to win he joked later that 
i was not that sure of the victory because i have done a lot of 
mischief during the 10 years as chairman 
the election took place on the third day of the congress which 
is meeting in a sports hall in this baltic port city the 
birthplace of solidarity during a nationwide strike wave in august 
1980 
the union held its last congress in the fall of 1981 just 
months before it was suppressed under martial law 
the sixday congress scheduled to end tuesday also will draw 
up a program determining solidaritys future role now that it has 
gone from being an opposition movement to being part of the 
political establishment 
walesas reelection comes as public opinion polls show the 
union losing popularity due to economic hardships brought by the 
solidarityled governments shock treatment austerity program for 
the countrys moribund economy 
some union members had criticized walesa for being undemocratic 
in his means of running solidarity but none of the bestknown 
union activists challenged him 
in order to ensure a choice walesa himself proposed the 
candidacy of slowik a bus driver and union leader from the central 
city of lodz who has often advocated a more militant course for the 
union slowik opposed any concessions to the communists during the 
negotiations that led to the relegalization of solidarity in april 
1989 after a sevenyear ban 
wojcik a chemist helped lead 1988 strikes against the 
thencommunist government in the wroclaw region in southwest poland 
in speeches before the balloting walesa and slowik differed 
over a key issue facing solidarity whether the union should step 
back from the political arena to emphasize its original trade union 
goals of defending workers interests 
walesa advocated an intermediate program mixing political 
and trade union goals but slowik said solidaritys only role 
should be as the leadership of a trade union not a social 
movement or political party 
the congress is expected to outline the unions stand on the 
governments economic reform program aimed at transforming polands 
centrally planned communist economy into a marketoriented 
capitalist system 
in its initial stages the reforms austerity measures have 
raised prices and thrown about 200000 people out of work 
solidaritybacked candidates swept partially free parliamentary 
elections last june and took control of the government from the 
communists installing tadeusz mazowiecki a former union adviser 
as prime minister in the east blocs first noncommunist government 
in almost 40 years 
but only about 22 million of the 10 million members the union 
claimed in 1981 have joined since it won back its legal status a 
year ago 
some critics have accused walesa of viewing the union 
chairmanship as only a stepping stone for an eventual bid for 
president of poland the post is currently held by gen wojciech 
jaruzelski the former communist party leader who led the december 
1981 martial law crackdown that suppressed solidarity 
earlier this month walesa raised the possibility of running for 
president but then backed away he said his remarks were meant 
only to spur the government to make the needed political and 
economic reforms

but the audience at the london coliseum cheered and applauded 
his performance friday night as the bewigged and powdered major

i once had a part in spensers faerie queene at covent 
garden about 50 years ago but this is virtually my first opera 
part he said sipping champagne in his dressing room afterward 
i was terrified i always have firstnight nerves the trouble 
is that with eight more performances all spaced out every time 
will seem like a first night but the audience was very kind and 
made up for the terror

batmans television sidekick robin 
wrote a 25000 check that bounced an architectural firm claims 
but actor burt ward says theyre the bad guys because they were 
asked to give it back and didnt 
the check was written by the costar of the 1960s television 
series to tra architects inc in ponte vedra beach on oct 1 1988 
ward planned to have the firm do work for him and asked tra to 
hold the check while his company negotiated a land purchase in 
arkansas he said friday by telephone from his beverly hills 
calif office 
when the land contract fell through ward said he asked tra to 
return the check he said he was not aware the company tried to 
cash the check until friday and planned to contact his lawyer 
its really not nice ward said 
officials at tra architects declined to comment on the matter

at 3 am the telephone buzzes adnan khashoggi 
awake in his luxurious bedroom 47 floors above manhattan the 
saudi arabian financier plugs the phone into a transmitter locked 
around his ankle sends a signal and goes back to sleep 
most people who deal in billions of dollars and hobnob with 
presidents and kings might think it demeaning to be monitored so 
but khashoggi seems amused by this nightly ritual that lets 
authorities check his whereabouts outside us district court 
where he is on trial with former philippine first lady imelda 
marcos 
i call it the governments wakeup service it wakes me up in 
time for morning prayers joked khashoggi a moslem raising a 
pants leg to reveal the black wristwatchlike gadget he added 
when this trial is over i might go into selling these things 
this one i am going to auction off for charity 
it wouldnt be the first time ak as his intimates call 
him found a business opportunity in an unexpected place he has 
done that for years on his way to becoming one of the worlds most 
famous citizens and for a time perhaps its richest 
despite a series of business setbacks in recent years khashoggi 
is so wealthy that numbers are almost irrelevant adnan would 
consider himself penniless if he was down to his last hundred 
million says james linn his lawyer 
khashoggi 54 is vague about his current worth but doubts that 
he ever was the worlds richest man he says that title belongs to 
his friend the sultan of brunei 
his wealth may be best judged by his bail he put up the 
required 10 million but authorities said it was small change to 
khashoggi and feared he would forfeit it for freedom he was 
released from jail only after king fahd of saudi arabia sent a 
letter guaranteeing that he would not attempt to flee and after he 
agreed to wear the monitoring device 
in an interview at his lavish apartment with its artworks by 
dufy and miro and its sweeping views of the city khashoggi 
described an investment portfolio that once ranged over 35 
countries 
in my heyday i used to earn 80 million to 100 million a year 
and probably spent on this style of life 40 million he said 
but when they say i am the worlds richest man how do they come 
to this conclusion i dont have 10 billion in the bank 
when a 600 million salt lake city project went bust in 1987 he 
lost 300 million that was the beginning of the disaster 
stories because it was me everybody thought i went bankrupt but 
it was not true he said 
khashoggi reportedly was a middleman and financier of the 
irancontra affair in which profits from secret us arms sales to 
iran were channeled to rebel groups fighting the sandinista 
government of nicaragua 
in his opening statement at the trial linn tried to dispel the 
idea that there was something wrong with being an arms trader 
saying all khashoggis arms dealings had us and saudi government 
approval 
khashoggi describes himself as an international salesman 
and merchant banker he insists there is nothing sinister or 
mysterious about what he does 
i am a hardworking man and i have to pay my bills he 
said i am just like you with a few extra zeros 
despite his wealth khashoggi takes the subway to and from court 
to avoid traffic last week when the train stalled he walked 29 
blocks home few passersby took notice of the short portly man 
talking into a handheld telephone as he strode up park avenue 
in court he dozes off occasionally as testimony focuses mainly 
on mrs marcos alleged financial misdeeds 
the government claims she and her late husband ferdinand 
looted their countrys treasury of about 220 million depositing 
some in secret swiss bank accounts and spending more on lavish 
living and real estate purchases 
khashoggi is charged with mail fraud and obstruction of justice 
it is alleged that he forged documents to help conceal the marcoses 
ownership of four new york office buildings and an art collection 
bought with stolen funds 
he concedes that he was foolish to get involved with the 
marcoses but contends he committed no crime because the document 
backdating occurred in 1985 the year before marcos was ousted from 
power and a us court froze all transactions involving the 
buildings 
when you ask me why this trial is unfair it is because they 
the prosecutors know all this he said without me they 
dont have a case they want to get the marcoses by hook or by 
crook 
khashoggi said he believes judge john f keenan eventually will 
dismiss the charges against him but if not hell be acquitted by 
the jury 
these people are not going to be unfair he said 
and he contended the trial is doing great damage to americas 
image in the middle east 
this case has become a symbol of fear he said i am 
trying to say hey guys this is not america we will have our 
day in court and they will see that it is not america but a corner 
street called new york

the walls of john towers downtown office hold 
daily reminders of the cabinet post that escaped the grasp of the 
former senator and arms control negotiator 
both the swords from west point and the photograph of president 
bush with his first nominee to run the pentagon testify to the time 
not too long ago when tower 64 thought he might become secretary 
of defense 
towers rejection in march 1989 by his former colleagues capped 
a rancorous period in the brief history of the bush administration 
and the long tradition of senate comity 
charges of womanizing and alcoholism were leveled at the former 
texas senator while republicans were bitter in their accusations 
of democratic partisanship 
more than a year later tower remains on the fringes of defense 
work dividing his time between dallas and washington he serves on 
bushs foreign intelligence advisory board teaches a course at 
southern methodist university on national security policy and does 
consulting 
he doesnt consult for defense contractors towers ties with 
them also prevented his confirmation 
in an interview last week tower provided a hint of the defense 
budget he would have crafted in light of the revolutionary changes 
in eastern europe and the soviet union 
i worry a little bit that the budget is anticipating changes 
that are going to take place before they take place said tower 
who sat across the table from the soviets during the reagan 
administration we have not completed our negotiations in two 
important areas 
tower believes that the administration and congress should wait 
until ussoviet treaties to reduce strategic weapons and 
conventional arms have been satisfactorily completed before 
military cuts are made 
i get a little concerned about our in effect conceding an 
advantage to the other side by making unilateral reductions before 
mutual reductions have been negotiated he said 
the former chairman of the senate armed services committee 
dismisses characterization as a cold warrior and says he is 
optimistic about the prospects for a us agreement with moscow 
his stand however is far closer to that of defense secretary 
dick cheney than several republicans and democrats in congress 
we have to continue our strategic modernization because 
the threat has not yet significantly diminished and because we are 
in the process of negotiating strategic arms reductions tower 
said 
he favors development of the b2 stealth bomber describing it 
as essential to the modernization of the airborne leg of the triad 
and as a key element in the nuclear deterrent 
opposition to the radarevading plane considered the most 
expensive in history at more than 530 million a copy is 
increasing in congress tower acknowledges that the battle over the 
batwinged bomber will be contentious 
although his support for the strategic defense initiative came 
under attack from leading conservatives last year he favors some 
type of antimissile shield 
i think its prudent to proceed with deployment of at least a 
rudimentary sdi system tower said bear in mind that the 
soviets do have in place an antiballistic missile system we do 
not 
this year is a transition year according to tower 
only after ussoviet treaties can the pentagon set its sights 
on a military that emphasizes force projection capability rather 
than the maintenance of massive land armies and large numbers of 
strategic weapons he said 
on the dispute between cheney and cia director william webster 
over the level of the soviet threat tower believes both are 
correct 
i think it would be very difficult for a hardliner to turn 
back the clock he said however the enormous military power 
of the soviet union has not diminished during the course of the 
gorbachev regime perhaps in terms of numbers it has but not in 
terms of capability 
tower wont comment directly on the cheney military blueprint 
explaining ive not walked a mile in his moccasins

when new englands long winter starts 
surrendering to spring new hampshires citizens get a special gift 
a long holiday weekend heralded in the heavens by halleys comet 
three centuries ago 
the state of many onlys and firsts on monday will once again be 
the only one to celebrate fast day 
the holiday was originally a day for new hampshire colonists to 
fast and pray for their ailing governor now its the time when 
folks pack away snow tires and storm windows bring out the 
baseball gloves and bats and lawn rakes and shop the fast day 
sales 
the first known fast day was observed by massachusetts after the 
drought of 1622 but in new hampshire the practice dates from the 
1680s after the appearance of halleys comet was divined as a 
portent of the demise of the colonys first governor john cutts 
when cutts fell ill citizens were urged to set aside march 17 
1681 to pray and fast for his recovery a custom peculiar to new 
england in times of fear of impending catastrophe 
in 1894 massachusetts substituted its fast day with patriots 
day to memorialize the revolutionary war massachusetts and maine 
observe patriots day on the third monday in april that leaves new 
hampshire with the only fast day now marked on the fourth monday 
of april 
in new hampshire little is known about cutts other than that 
he was president of the royal province by grace of charles 
ii was an immigrant from wales and sometimes spelled his name 
cutt 
cutts was the richest merchant in portsmouth the colonial 
capital on may 6 1680 when he was 60 he had a foreboding of his 
death and wrote his will by the following year he was so ill that 
the colonial general assembly declared a day of fasting 
humiliation and prayer for his recovery 
his death the assembly feared would occasion much trouble 
and noted that awful portentous blazing star usually 
foreboding sore calamity the comet whose path was being plotted 
in england by the 25yearold astronomer edmund halley 
the special day didnt help cutts who died april 1 1681 but 
his fast day lived on 
other things however have changed church attendance no longer 
is compulsory and citizens no longer must listen to sermons such as 
three of the public evils of the day public education 
extravagance intemperance 
recreation no longer is forbidden and the 10shilling fine 
against those taking part in labour business or work of their 
ordinary calling was abolished long ago 
fast day since has been transformed into a time of relaxation 
and recreation with extravagance of mercantile promotions rivaled 
only by presidents day sales 
state offices have stayed open for the past five years thanks 
to a contract provision that makes fast day a floating holiday that 
some state workers take at another time 
but school is out and banks and some city and town offices 
close leaving plenty of shoppers and rakers and ball players to 
enjoy the budding spring

president bush is giving mikhail 
gorbachev a few more days to loosen the economic noose the kremlin 
is tightening to keep lithuania inside the soviet union 
bush set off fishing this morning clad in a green shirt 
camouflage pants red cap and white satin wyoming centennial 
jacket wish us luck was the vacationing presidents only 
comment to reporters as the party left on florida marine patrol 
speedboats 
on friday the white house put moscow on notice to expect a us 
response early next week unless gorbachev lets up against the 
rebellious republic 
bush himself said nothing during political speeches friday in 
birmingham ala and orlando fla about the crisis threatening a 
setback for ussoviet relations 
asked as he toured orlandos sea world why he needed more time 
to frame a response bush said only theres a lot of 
consultations going on right now 
but amid reports the soviets were intercepting food supplies and 
shutting off lithuanias oil and gas and eyewitness accounts of 
troopers seizing a printing plant in vilnius white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater decried what he called another unfortunate 
step in the soviet economic crackdown 
a senior us official today said secretary of state james baker 
had had a telephone discussion about lithuania with soviet foreign 
minister edouard shevardnadze early friday afternoon a previous 
telephone conversation between the two was announced on wednesday 
bakers consistent approach to the soviets has been a call for a 
peaceful solution to the dispute with the maverick republic 
bush flew by helicopter from homestead air force base late 
friday night after helping fill republican coffers with more than 
2 million in birmingham and orlando he was accompanied by 
national security adviser brent scowcroft treasury secretary 
nicholas brady sen alan simpson rwyo and overseas private 
investment corp chairman fred zeder on hand to join the fishing 
expedition 
fitzwater standing in a hotel driveway in birmingham said bush 
had stepped up consultations with us allies and would meet 
early next week with leaders of congress before taking action 
administration officials reiterated that bush was contemplating 
making the soviets pay an economic price for the campaign to force 
the baltic republic to retreat from its march 11 declaration of 
independence 
bush has been treading cautiously trying to promote a peaceful 
dialogue that would respect the lithuanians right to 
selfdetermination and not cloud ussoviet relations and 
prospects for nuclear arms negotiations 
fitzwater said the united states still hopes this matter can 
be resolved in a responsible manner 
he said the president would complete his deliberations early 
next week and meet with lawmakers to discuss possible courses 
of action 
i would assume that we would be prepared to announce actions 
fairly soon after that the spokesman said 
when asked why bush needed more time to frame a response 
fitzwater replied because many of the actions that we would 
contemplate taking would involve other countries would have 
international implications and we therefore think its important 
that we touch base with our allies on this issue 
the administration already has signaled that the most likely 
us action against moscow would be economic such as trade rather 
than a slowdown in arms negotiations or discussions of regional 
disputes 
bush and gorbachev agreed at the malta summit last december on 
expanded commercial contacts that now stand in jeopardy 
asked if any sort of military reprisal were possible fitzwater 
said weve said from the beginning that we didnt anticipate 
military involvement 
bush was spending the weekend at a private condominium on a 
stretch of florida keys 75 miles south of miami 
he was loudly applauded at the florida gop dinner in orlando 
when he predicted that democracy will come to cuba which he called 
the one last hardline holdout in the west 
it will happen the people of cuba will be free i guarantee 
you that said bush who also criticized the senate for not 
passing his 800 million emergency aid package for the new regimes 
in panama and nicaragua

prime minister lothar de maiziere said 
saturday that a new wave of frustrated east germans will head west 
unless their wages and pensions are valued at west german standards 
in his toughest remarks yet on the issue the east german leader 
said he would not back down from his demand that most east german 
marks be converted equally to west german marks as the nations are 
unified 
as far as wages salaries and pensions are concerned it is 
not negotiable he said in an joint interview on east and west 
german radio 
west germanys central bank has said most east german marks must 
be converted at a 21 exchange and that an equal trade would erode 
the power of the mighty west german mark and result in higher 
interest rates and inflation 
the nonconvertible east german mark is essentially worthless in 
free market economies 
but de maiziere said the 11 rate is needed to offset the 
effects of eliminating the vast price and rent subsidies of east 
germanys former socialist government 
he said that not granting the 11 conversion could result in a 
new flood of east germans to the west more than 500000 east 
germans have migrated to west germany in the past year 
many left after the former communist government opened the east 
german borders in november in an attempt to quell massive 
prodemocracy demonstrations 
the protests brought down old stalinist regime and de maiziere 
was chosen prime minister after his party won the most votes in 
east germanys first free elections on march 18 
chancellor helmut kohl said on saturday that the west german 
mark will definitely become the currency of east germany on july 2 
the east german news agency adn said both governments previously 
had set that date to merge their currencies 
kohl during an appearance in wolfsburg west germany also said 
the currency exchange demands in east germany will be taken into 
consideration during negotiations adn said 
he also said that joint elections in a unified germany could 
conceivably be held in the latter third of next year but that he 
wouldnt seek to postpone the west german elections on dec 2 adn 
said 
both germanys say unification is inevitable but there has been 
increased sniping in recent weeks over how to mesh east germanys 
decaying socialist economy with the wealthy west 
the two germanys are to begin talks within two weeks on merging 
their economies as a prelude to eventual full unification 
the government of west german chancellor helmut kohl has been 
putting together its own proposal for a monetary union 
in a report to be published on monday the west german magazine 
der spiegel said the kohl government will in fact grant 11 
exchanges on east german savings accounts of 5000 marks about 
2800 to 8000 marks about 4700 or less 
the report said some wages and pensions also would receive a 11 
exchange 
it said the conversion would cost about 40 billion marks 23 
billion a year 
a west german government spokesman speaking on condition of 
anonymity dismissed the der spiegel report as speculation 
both germanys say they want to combine their economies by july 
1 talks involving the superpowers also are expected in the coming 
weeks on the strategic future of a united germany

slovenia and croatia communist 
yugoslavias wealthiest republics observed a day of silence 
saturday ahead of crucial elections that may determine the fate of 
this fragile balkan country 
in croatia voters will choose sunday among more than 30 parties 
vying for parliamentary seats in the republics first multiparty 
elections in 50 years 
in slovenias secondround balloting 14 million people who 
voted on april 8 will elect the state president and 65 remaining 
parliamentary deputies 
under existing law all campaign activities stop a day before 
the elections to give citizens a chance to think about their 
decisions before voting 
slovenia and croatia have liberal judiciaries and media unlike 
yugoslavias largest republic of serbia and they are already 
pushing for closer ties with the west 
if proindependence forces win in both republics they would 
move further away from serbias hardline communist leadership and 
could tear apart the loose federation of six republics and two 
autonomous provinces 
slovenian voters will choose between milan kucan a reform 
communist who steered the republic to a multiparty democracy and 
joze pucnik an advocate of slovenian independence 
kucan won 446 percent of firstround voting in slovenia the 
most prosperous of yugoslavias republics pucnik who heads the 
centerright demos coalition was second with 266 percent 
demos an alliance of five opposition parties won about 55 
percent of the vote for the state legislature and barring an 
upset was expected to form the first noncommunist government in 
yugoslavia since 1945 
in croatia the secondlargest republic behind serbia 16 
representatives of the us republican and democratic parties will 
monitor the elections said milko gajski president of the local 
election commission 
three main political groupings and a host of smaller parties 
will field 1706 candidates in croatias elections for 356 seats in 
the threechamber state legislature 
the three main contenders are the croatian democratic union the 
coalition for national accord and the reformed communist party 
during a twohour televised debate that officially marked the 
end of campaigning friday leaders of the three main groups 
delivered their final message to the electorate 
the debate showed that the differences between us are slim on 
most issues anton vujic of the centrist fiveparty coalition 
differences center on whether yugoslavia should become a 
confederation in which states would have full sovereign rights 
favored by the centerright croatian democratic union or remain a 
federation favored by the communists 
critics in serbia regularly accuse the union of being 
extremist and fascist and of planning to secede from 
yugoslavia if they win a parliamentary majority 
earlier this month the yugoslav army warned that any attempt by 
slovenia or croatia to win independence from the rest of the 
country will be prevented 
mika tripalo of croatias coalition said his group advocates a 
compromise a state contract signed by all republics to 
provide for a small but efficient federal government 
preelection surveys indicate the communists now called the 
party for democratic change are leading with the union in second 
place and the coalition trailing third 
the polls show however onethird of croatias 35 million 
registered voters are still undecided 
two other yugoslav republics bosnia and macedonia have 
legalized opposition parties and are expected to schedule free 
elections soon 
but in serbia and montenegro the smallest republic the ruling 
communists have yet to legalize independent parties both still 
follow a oneparty system and there is a strong communist influence 
in the press judiciary and other aspects of life 
polls there open in slovenia at 7 am and close at 7 pm in 
croatia polls are also open for 12 hours starting at 8 am first 
results in both republics are expected around midnight

a woman pleaded guilty to killing her 
infant son by feeding him sulfuric acid and will testify that the 
boys father planned the poisoning to collect damages from a 
babyformula maker prosecutors said 
sheila smith 27 said guilty in a soft voice friday in 
making her plea to a firstdegree murder charge in a convoluted 
case that has gone before the us supreme court 
smith and ricky irby sr 29 were charged with murder in the 
death of their son quinten irby irbys trial is scheduled to begin 
april 30 
quinten was 3 months old when he was poisoned in may 1984 he 
lingered in a hospital for more than two years before dying aug 
26 1986 at the age of 2 
during fridays hearing lake county prosecutor matthew chancey 
said smith will testify that irby told her on may 30 1984 that 
he had a way to make some money but it would involve hurting 
quinten 
at the time smith was on public aid living with her parents in 
the town of north chicago and irby was an unemployed auto worker 
later that evening chancey continued ricky irby told smith 
that he had messed with the milk he mentioned acid the next 
day quinten was hospitalized and irby produced an open can of 
formula and a bottle that proved to be tainted with sulfuric acid 
quintens burns scarred his mouth and trachea he had one lung 
removed and remained on a respirator apparently comatose until 
his death 27 months later ingestion of sufuric acid was ruled to 
be the cause 
after the boy died irby sued a baby formula manufacturer but 
the suit was withdrawn before it went to trial 
under her plea bargain smith will escape a possible death 
penalty but could get up to 65 years in prison her sentencing is 
scheduled for june 29 
a dispute over the handling of evidence in the case at one point 
led to the us supreme court 
the evidence was tested by toxicologist joerg pirl at a state 
crime laboratory in chicago but it and pirls case file were 
discovered missing in january 1985 well before the child died 
at one point pirl underwent hypnosis in an effort to find the 
evidence but the hypnotist later died and pirl could not recall 
what he had told the man said laureen cahill casey a lake county 
public defender representing smith 
investigators later determined that the evidence had been 
destroyed accidentally by a lab clerical worker and with no 
evidence the case essentially was closed chancey said 
it was reopened after a us supreme court ruling in november 
1988 that said evidence lost by accident does not preclude 
prosecution smith and irby were charged with murdering their son 
in an indictment returned may 31 1989 
both parents have been held on 1 million bail 
the couples older son ricky irby jr 9 lives with smiths 
mother

shrouds and death masks outside the y12 nuclear weapons plant at 
oak ridge tenn west of knoxville the point is to symbolize the 
destructiveness of war and the waste of resources that might 
otherwise be devoted to repairing the environment organizers said 
earth days organizers hope it will kick off a new decade of 
environmental awareness much as the original earth day in 1970 
launched a decade that saw the creation of the environmental 
protection agency and the passage of landmark environmental 
legislation 
earth day 1990 must do the same promote enactment of a new 
truly clean air act accelerate a worldwide ban on cfcs 
chlorofluorcarbons encourage community groups to work with 
neighboring industry to prevent adverse health effects from 
industrial emissions and involve individuals in the effort to 
improve the state of the environment said hayes 
the government also must reduce dependence on fossil fuels by 
creating incentives for conservation and energy efficiency and by 
promoting research on alternative energy sources he said 
the initial earth day was conceived by gaylord nelson of the 
wilderness society then a senator from wisconsin as an 
environmental teachin modeled after the antivietnamwar 
teachins of that era 
on friday nelson called on students at indiana university to 
form a conservation generation 
i dont want to have to come limping back here 20 years from 
now said nelson 74 and have the embarrassing responsibility

the british government says its a gun but 
speculation rages about iraqs purpose in ordering eight massive 
steel tubes that were seized by british customs officers 
whatever device the tubes may have been for it would be the 
worlds largest perhaps a cannon a rocket launcher an update of 
germanys v4 gun an experiment or just something to show off 
various experts have suggested 
the hypothetical weapon has also been described as too long too 
flimsy and too vulnerable for a workable gun 
i wouldnt say a gun i think a launch system is the right 
thing to say christopher foss editor of janes armor and 
artillery said in an interview friday i think the actual 
military mission is still hard to define 
customs officers seized the tubes with an overall length of 131 
feet on april 12 in middlesbrough the manufacturer sheffield 
forgemasters and the iraqi government insisted the tubes fit into 
a petrochemical plant 
iraq claims it is the target of a smear campaign orchestrated by 
britain and israel since last months execution of a londonbased 
journalist in baghdad iraq had accused the iranianborn man of 
being a spy 
other suspected weapons parts shipped from britain to iraq were 
intercepted friday by customs officers in greece and turkey 
britain banned weapons shipments to iran and iraq when the two 
countries were at war and the ban remains in effect 
iraq has been aggressively developing weapons including the new 
alabbas missile with a reported range of 560 miles and a 210mm 
selfpropelled gun unveiled last year 
iraqi president saddam hussein has said his arsenal includes 
chemical weapons iraq is also thought to be attempting to develop 
atomic weapons 
the tubes seized on the dock in middlesbrough were unlike any 
artillery now in use the barrel was in eight pieces not one and 
had a smooth bore devoid of the spiral rifling that is standard in 
artillery 
there is no question it could be used as a barrel of a large 
artillery gun to fire a projectile of some considerable size 
said douglas tweddle chief customs investigator 
but the bore reported by customs officers to be 1000 mm was 
nearly five times wider than the 203 mm selfpropelled howitzers 
that are the largest in the us and soviet arsenals 
sheffield forgemasters acknowledged that space research corp of 
brussels founded by cannon builder gerald bull was involved in 
the project 
the government says the tubes correspond to a bull design based 
on guns he helped build for the uscanadian high altitude 
research project in the 1960s the socalled harp gun theoretically 
could fire a rocketboosted shell 1150 miles the british journal 
defense reported 
bull later founded space research in vermont he served a brief 
jail term in 1980 for violating the us arms embargo against south 
africa 
bull was found shot dead outside his apartment in brussels on 
march 22 
robert turp a british ballistics consultant said bull would 
work for literally anyone who would give him the money and 
facilities to play with designs for big guns 
at various times bulls clients reportedly included israel and 
china as well as south africa and iraq 
defense reported in february that iraq had shown interest in a 
gun based on the harp designs capable of firing satellites or 
weapons into low earth orbit 
defense asked bulls son michel whether space research was 
involved i cannot confirm this or discuss it bull was quoted 
as saying but he confirmed space research had very close 
contacts in iraq including military contracts 
if the tubes seized in britain were used as a conventional gun 
with a single explosive charge it would blow itself to pieces 
said phillip wright chief executive of sheffield forgemasters 
but experts say there are other ways to accelerate a projectile 
and some have pointed to the german v4 built in world war ii 
the v4 according to the imperial war museum was a 150mm gun 
built in 40 sections totaling 492 feet the v4 had 28 powder 
chambers that fired in rapid sequence as the projectile moved up 
the barrel 
built near calais on the french side of the english channel the 
v4 was bombed by the royal air force before it could fire any of 
its 150pound projectiles at london 
the independent citing unidentified sources in space resaerch 
said forgemasters built parts for two barrels each 492 feet long 
in 26 sections forgemasters has acknowledged shipping 44 pieces of 
tubing before the eight were seized

this year is off to the second warmest start 
on record the federal climate analysis center reports 
only 1921 was warmer during the first three months of the year 
according to climate records going back to 1895 
the nations average temperature in march was just over 45 
degrees fahrenheit making it the 10th warmest march on record the 
center noted 
that followed the nations warmest january on record with an 
average temperature of about 37 degrees and the 15th warmest 
february when temperatures averaged just above 37 degrees 
the hot first quarter contrasts sharply with 1989 which went 
out with the 4th coldest december on record overall 1989 was 
somewhat cooler than average in the united states 
januarys warm weather has been attributed to strong westerly 
winds that carried abundant moisture ashore in the northwest and 
blocked cold air from moving south out of canada during the month 
that blocking prevented normal cold from developing and led to the 
record warm month 
the first half of february was a continuation of januarys 
weather pattern but by midmonth weather began to look more 
normal with severe outbreaks developing 
march is usually a month of contrasts and this year was no 
exception but a strong high pressure area kept the east warm early 
in the month before weakening and giving way to cool damp weather 
at the end of the month in midmonth however cold weather in the 
west was replaced by mild air moving inland from the pacific ocean

a wedding for junior gotti on saturday hey 
forget about it 
the 26yearold son of reputed mob boss john gotti wasnt seen 
tying the knot at his neighborhood church saturday afternoon but 
that didnt stop assorted reporters and shutterbugs from staking 
out the building in anticipation of the rumored nuptials 
the elder gotti whos used to the intense scrutiny of federal 
agents was shadowed instead by local media types desperately 
seeking bridesmaids but the press found no sign of the brides 
family or the gambino family at the queens church 
in fact the only wedding saturday at our lady of grace roman 
catholic church in howard beach featured two people whose phones 
were never even wiretapped probably 
rumors were rampant last week that john a junior gotti 
whose dad is the reputed head of the nations most powerful crime 
family would be walking down the aisle saturday with kim albanese 
married to the mob the tabloids yelled the two have 
reportedly been dating for three years 
junior himself dismissed the reports 
i dont know what youre talking about he told the daily 
news you guys believe everything you hear 
his dad the dapper don wasnt wearing a tux saturday 
afternoon when he slipped out the back door of his queens home and 
zipped over to his local hangout the bergin hunt and fish club 
if there was a wedding saturday the reception allegedly was 
to take place at the posh helmsley palace in manhattan a large 
italian flag fluttering outside the building was the only thing 
even hinting at a bash for junior 
law enforcement officials say that the younger gotti followed 
his father in the gambino family business last year he is said to 
be president of a brooklyn trucking company and he has been 
arrested several times in bar fights

the european community on saturday called 
on moscow to lift its expanding embargo on natural gas oil and 
other shipments to lithuania denouncing the action as coercive 
foreign ministers attending the 12nation meeting in dublin 
urged immediate talks to end the crisis 
however wary of destabilizing soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev the foreign ministers made no move to take action 
against moscow and ignored a plea by the baltic republic for full 
recognition as an independent state 
moscow has cut all oil and more than 80 percent of lithuanias 
natural gas supply to get the republic to rescind its march 11 
declaration of independence food and raw materials from soviet 
sources were also being curtailed 
the community nations believe measures of a coercive nature 
can make no contribution to the search for a solution through 
dialogue the foreign ministers said in a joint declaration 
expressing grave concern the community statement called for 
maximum restraint and said an outcome acceptable to all 
is possible only by means of discussion 
it said the foreign ministers call on all concerned not to 
carry through measures which are inconsistent with this objective 
irish officials said the irish ambassador to moscow patrick 
mccabe will present the european communitys demand for a lifting 
of the lithuanian blockade to the kremlin 
the foreign ministers said they would meet again soon to review 
the situation but gave no date they also made no hint of plans to 
take action against the soviet union 
lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene had sent a 
message to the meeting calling on the european community to 
recognize the independence of lithuania 
by recognizing lithuania now the ec can protest the soviet 
unions obstacles to normal trade relations not only between us 
and the soviet union but also between us and the rest of the 
world mrs prunskiene said 
other countries shouldnt leave us alone to solve this 
problem she said in copenhagen 
danish foreign minister uffe ellemannjensen who met mrs 
prunskiene in copenhagen earlier saturday relayed her appeal to 
the western alliance 
a spokesman for the irish government which holds the current 
presidency of the community said the ministers reply is 
appropriate 
it is not just important for the european community to 
maintain good relations with the soviet government said the 
spokesman speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity 
it is important from lithuanias own point of view that 
gorbachev is not undermined 
the irish spokesman stressed the community was not calling on 
lithuania to retract its declaration of independence 
the oneday foreign ministers meeting was called to prepare for 
a special european community summit april 28 on incorporating east 
germany into the western trade bloc and a call by some members for 
political and economic union of the community by 1993 
ireland included lithuania in the agenda at the last minute 
marking the communitys first move on lithuania since moscow began 
the blockade this week

mutiny is stirring in cumberland county 
among republicans saddled by a chairman who broke the commandment 
thou shalt not criticize a party candidate 
to make matters worse paul a volle was arrested on a 2121 
shoplifting charge but still refuses to step down as party chairman 
gop regulars called a special meeting wednesday with an eye to 
removing volle before the state convention friday the same day 
hes to be arraigned in district court on the charge of stealing 
batteries and microcassettes from a supermarket 
but no one is confident enough to predict victory against the 
conservative forces of volle a supporter of former television 
evangelist and presidential candidate pat robertson 
volle first angered his fellow partisans in january by saying 
republican congressional candidate david emery a former us 
representative who lost a 1982 senate race to sen george j 
mitchell should abandon his candidacy for the good of the party 
after flipflopping from an antiabortion position to prochoice 
volle called a press conference and implied it was him 
speaking as the chairman of the republican central committee 
said everett giles a former county gop chairman many republicans 
were outraged by that violation of the partys socalled 11th 
commandment which prohibits republicans from running down 
republicans 
you dont speak evil of other republicans giles said 
then when volle was arrested march 20 and charged with 
shoplifting party regulars and state gop chairman phil jackson 
assumed volle would step down 
they were wrong 
at an april 11 meeting called to determine volles status as 
chairman he adamantly refused to quit 
i have been asked to resign volle said i refuse to do 
so 
when republican regulars moved to oust the chairman volle 
called the motion out of order volles opponents admit they were 
outmaneuvered through volles superior use of the party bylaws 
when you go to the ball youd better have your dancing shoes 
and we didnt said tony payne a former republican chairman for 
portland cumberland county includes portland and surrounding areas 
weve had some difficulties in the process because paul has 
used the procedures to shield himself from the debate payne 
said he ruled that the motion that had been made was out of 
order he made a number of arbitrary rulings as chairman he has 
that prerogative we dont know what the dickens is going to 
transpire 
they need a twothirds vote by county party committee members to 
oust volle at wednesdays meeting 
part of volles power base includes his wife carolyn the 
county partys secretary who is accused by volles foes of 
withholding information on who the committee members are and which 
ones may vote in the special meeting 
neither volle nor mrs volle has returned several messages left 
on their telephone answering machine 
but volles supporters note that he has not been proven guilty 
of anything 
i guess the question is why should he step down said 
carolyn cosby chairman of the portland city gop he claims he is 
innocent and i believe him i think this has turned into some kind 
of a witchhunt 
i have had a number of harassing phone calls since this has 
taken place she said saturday those people who are paul 
volles supporters are being bothered 
volle has worked tirelessly for the party and helped form a 
strong slate of candidates for the november elections she said 
but giles expressed concerns that if volle survives the meeting 
wednesday and appears at the state convention he will become even 
further entrenched 
at the 1988 state convention volle and other robertson 
supporters tried to drag out a debate on an antiabortion amendment 
but were muzzled by party regulars 
payne said volle was able to gain power in the local party 
following the 1988 presidential election when payne led the local 
republicans who favored george bush and volle led the backers of 
robertson 
many party regulars backed volle in an unsuccessful run for the 
state house 
my concern at this juncture is that pauls methodic wresting 
of power from mainstream republicans has resulted in a party of 
volles group that is not inclusive payne said its a case of 
one guy who refuses to budge its an aberration of one 
personality

derek chung is a spam fan with a mission to 
enlighten college students about this brick of pink meat 
i just put up posters to get people here to eat more spam 
said chung a senior at carnegiemellon university 
i can never tell whether people will want to come over and 
actually eat the stuff 
chung spent saturday trying to coerce 50 or so fellow students 
to sample the culinary delights of spam at spamfest vi his sixth 
free love feast of canned luncheon meat soda pop and twinkies 
billed as the premier pork event of carnegie mellon the 
minifestival at chungs offcampus apartment draws the curious the 
doubters and the determined 
we dont sit around and eat spam normally said senior 
barbara mcquain 21 of elkins wva but derek makes things out 
of spam that you wouldnt believe 
theres spam pizza spamwiches macaroni and spam and the main 
staple spam and eggs 
chung said the alltime favorite is spam polynesian in which 
the meat is sliced up mixed with pineapple and served in a 
pineapple shell topped with apricot preserves to cover up some of 
the spam flavor 
spam partially fills you up and partially you just dont want 
to eat much of it said chung 20 of dublin ohio 
bob patterson vice president at geo a hormel amp co in austin 
minn said the company is used to jokes aimed at its most famous 
product which was introduced in 1937 and was a staple of gis 
during world war ii 
even back in the early days people would joke about it as a 
ham that didnt pass its physical he said 
but youve got to laugh at yourself once in while 
chung has extolled the versatility of spam since his freshman 
year when he began serving it as a snack to members of his study 
group he has held spamfests twice a year since but skipped last 
falls fest because consumption had tapered off 
i figured if i skipped one people would be hungry enough to 
eat more next time he said i dont want leftovers

flags were lowered and cafes and restaurants 
closed their doors late saturday as israelis began marking the most 
tragic event in jewish history the loss of 6 million lives at the 
hands of the nazis in world war ii 
holocaust day comes on the 27th day of the hebrew lunar month of 
nisan the timing set by parliament to fall between the 
anniversary of the 1943 warsaw jewish ghetto uprising against the 
nazis and israels independence day 
a 1961 law orders all places of entertainment shut for the 
holiday which begins at sundown saturday and ends 24 hours later 
some of the 300000 israelis who survived the holocaust are now 
leading the nation the family of polishborn prime minister 
yitzhak shamir was killed by the nazis 
the 800000 children of victims have been named a second 
generation of victims 
although the shadow of the holocaust still hovers over lives and 
deeply influences israeli politics its impact is diminishing the 
annual 24hour memorial is intended to remind them of the jewish 
loss 
our generation is not free from prejudice and evil 
shamir told a solemn gathering of survivors and soldiers at 
jerusalems yad vashem holocaust memorial saturday 
manifestations of antisemitism throughout the world use the 
winds of freedom to carry their lying voices history must not 
be forgotten 
concentration camp survivors and former jewish fighters in the 
allied armies of world war ii then lit six torches 
as they did last year hundreds of israeli children and soldiers 
will recite lists of victims names and ages at ceremonies across 
the country the main opening ceremony for the namereading will be 
held sunday at israels knesset or parliament 
near tel avivs culture hall dozens of people stood in line and 
read names of slain relatives from a podium 
my father yisrael my mother ethel my four brothers mendel 
yehiel yosef and baruch and my two sisters a small elderly 
woman recited 
although israel is preoccupied with its political crisis 
weekend newspaper editions devoted much of their space to holocaust 
stories and some interviewed germans living in israel 
rock music and newsreels were gradually replaced by solemn tunes 
and interviews with survivors in radio broadcasts 
this year holocaust day carries a unique meaning for israel 
because of renewed ties with eastern europe the jewish state hopes 
that the warming in relations will enable it to gather new 
information on the holocaust and reveal new names of nazi war 
criminals 
some new names were found this year like those of 223 
lithuanian and polish war crime suspects who fled abroad after the 
war nazihunting groups plan to turn these names over to the 
united states west germany and australia 
the focus of holocaust remembrance this year shifted to poland 
where some 4000 jewish teenagers including about 1000 israelis 
are to conduct a onemile march of the living from auschwitz to 
the birkenau death camp the march was to be broadcast live on 
israeli television and radio 
earlier this week the youths visited other death camp sites in 
poland where millions of jews were killed in the holocaust 
another eastern european country east germany this month made 
a major gesture of reconciliation gesture when its new freely 
elected parliament apologized for the atrocities of the nazi 
holocaust israel had not maintained diplomatic ties with east 
germany because that countrys former communist government refused 
to offer an apology

pope john paul ii and president 
vaclav havel on saturday celebrated czechoslovakias peaceful 
revolution that toppled the communists portraying it as a victory 
over spiritual darkness 
hundreds of thousands of faithful welcomed the polishborn 
pontiff as he made his first visit to eastern europe since a 
prodemocracy tide ousted the regions hardline communist leaders 
last year 
it is the first time i have seen so many believers around me 
people who do not fear to show their faith said 25yearold 
martin a franciscan studying for the priesthood in the moravian 
city of brno 
the roman catholic leaders twoday trip which includes stops 
in velehrad and bratislava on sunday was hastily arranged at 
havels request to allow john paul to lend his support to 
democratic change the pontiff was last in eastern europe in june 
1987 when he visited poland 
in a prelude to the trip the vatican and czechoslovakia 
restored diplomatic relations thursday after a 40year 
interruption as barriers have fallen throughout eastern europe 
the vatican has moved quickly to forge ties with countries with 
centuries of christian tradition 
i daresay i am participating in a miracle said havel a 
nominal catholic who only last year was jailed by the hardline 
czechoslovak regime for his dissident activities 
the messenger of love comes into a country devastated by the 
ideology of hatred the living symbol of civilization comes into a 
country devastated by the rule of the uncivilized he said 
john paul speaking of the entire region said communism had 
proved itself to be a tragic utopia because it denied the 
spiritual needs of man 
he assailed what he called the violent application of a 
materialistic ideology that had paralyzed the nations of eastern 
europe 
huge crowds standing eight deep waited during sporadic 
thunderstorms to watch the popes motorcade pass through the narrow 
cobblestoned streets leading to the spired gothic cathedral and 
hradcany castle the presidential residence 
an openair mass on the letna plain for decades the site of 
staged communist party extravaganzas drew an estimated half 
million people including many from neighboring poland waving 
solidarity banners the crowd stayed despite a raging 10minute 
cloudburst and intermittent rain throughout the twohour service 
nevertheless the mood of the throng was cheerful for what was 
believed to be the biggest mass in czechoslovakia since before 
world war ii 
the pope turns 70 next month and who was making the 46th foreign 
pilgrimage of his pontificate 
referring to the countrys former rulers he said at the mass 
the ones who feared truth and freedom feared christ 
he urged czechs and slovaks to guard against divisive 
nationalist tensions now you have to unite and together step out 
into the future he said 
the papal speeches were filled with praise and encouragement for 
the czechoslovak church and its 90yearold leader frantisek 
tomasek for whom the visit is a vindication of decades of 
resistance to communist pressures 
the church in czechoslovakia suffered greater repression than 
anywhere in the soviet bloc and up to 10 of its 13 dioceses have 
remained vacant for years 
in a meeting with members of the clergy john paul told them he 
was paying tribute to all your suffering to listen to you to 
ackowledge publicly the value of the witnesses of your church and 
to thank you for it 
he cautioned them however against what he called viruses 
from the west listing secularism hedonistic consumerism and 
atheism 
in the evening the pope was scheduled to meet with havel at 
hradcany castle and then deliver an address 
on sunday he was to travel to velehrad and bratislava in 
velehrad 1985 celebrations were held to honor saints cyril and 
methodius who helped spread christianity in the slavic world 
john paul often deplored the state of the church in the east 
bloc and urged roman catholics in czechoslovakia to remain firm in 
their faith 
but soon after the regime led by milos jakes was toppled by 
czechoslovakias peaceful revolution last year restrictions on the 
church were lifted and longvacant bishops posts were filled 
statistics released by the vatican estimate 107 million 
catholics live in czechoslovakia out of a population of 156 
million

two weeks after a failed launch 
attempt an improved discovery is ready to embark on one of the 
most momentous shuttle missions hoisting the hubble space 
telescope high enough to behold the threshold of time 
the countdown began saturday afternoon for a launch set for 831 
am edt tuesday if the launch goes on schedule and all else goes 
well the first picture from hubble could be available next weekend 
we are as excited maybe even more you can cut it with a 
knife incredible said eric chaisson senior scientist at the 
space telescope science institute at johns hopkins university in 
baltimore 
nothing at least scientifically seems to have been lost as a 
result of the twoweek wait one of numerous delays plaguing the 
mission since its original 1983 launch date 
as chaisson remarked last week the universe has been around 
for 15 billion years a couple of weeks is not going to matter 
the heavens look the same to me the secrets are the same 
chaisson said 
theres not a bit of difference agreed charles pellerin 
jr nasas director of astrophysics i think the main point is 
the hubble space telescope still is in perfect condition 
the 15 billion telescope the most expensive unmanned 
spacecraft ever built rests safely inside discoverys payload bay 
awaiting the tuesday launch 
if all goes well discovery will return to edwards air force 
base calif on sunday april 29 with an empty payload bay nasa 
said it may release its first telescope image from hubble of an 
open star cluster in the constellation carina as early as that 
same day 
after the early test images are made and other preparatory work 
is done hubble is expected to start providing significant 
scientific data by satellite in a month or two 
the observatory is considered the greatest advance in astronomy 
since galileo first used a telescope in 1609 it also is considered 
by many at nasa to be the most important shuttle mission to date 
it will be the 35th 
the telescope is named for the late astronomer edwin p hubble 
who discovered during the 1920s the universe constantly is 
expanding his work gave rise to the theory the universe was 
created by a tremendous explosion about 15 billion years ago 
from its perch far above earths obstructing atmosphere the 
telescope will be able to discern objects 50 times fainter and with 
10 times greater clarity than the best groundbased observatory 
astronomers are counting on hubble to unravel some of the 
mystery surrounding quasars pulsars and black holes by studying 
stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling to 
earth for 14 billion years they hope to determine the precise 
origin of the universe and learn whether other solar systems and 
life forms exist 
if everything goes well its going to knock our socks off 
chaisson said 
nasas sole attempt to launch discovery was halted four minutes 
before liftoff april 10 when one of the shuttles three auxiliary 
power units failed the 88pound unit was replaced with a new one 
the first time nasa ever had installed such a unit at the launch 
pad 
the procedure went so smoothly the space agency decided last 
week to advance the launch to tuesday a day earlier than planned 
hubbles six nickelhydrogen batteries were returned to the 
telescope friday following 130 hours of recharging the batteries 
will power hubble from the time it is disconnected from discoverys 
power system until its energycollecting solar panels are deployed 
380 miles above earth the highest a shuttle has ever gone 
astronaut steven a hawley will use the shuttles mechanical arm 
to lift the 24250pound telescope into space on the second day of 
the mission the telescopes aperture door will be opened on the 
next to allow the first starlight to strike the mirror 
mission specialists bruce mccandless ii and kathryn sullivan 
veteran spacewalkers will leave the cabin to assist if necessary 
the shuttle will follow hubble from 40 miles away in case a problem 
develops and the telescope must be retrieved and returned to earth 
you can never eliminate those oddball quirks of fate or 
gremlins that may sneak up on any given day sullivan said but 
those are very remote potentials i really suspect we wont 
encounter 
in addition to the 15 billion cost of the telescope 500 
million has been spent to stockpile spare parts train astronauts 
and develop computer software to operate the instrument the 
european space agency contributed 250 million to the hubble 
project and will get to use the telescope 15 percent of the time

a top lithuanian official said saturday 
that moscow has clamped a full economic blockade on the baltic 
republic and support from the west is crucial 
lithuania closed its factories for the day to conserve fuel and 
raw materials during the kremlin embargo designed to pressure the 
republic into rescinding its declaration of independence leaders 
of the republic said they are seeking a compromise with moscow but 
no firm proposals are under discussion 
moscow has cut off all oil and more than 80 percent of 
lithuanias natural gas supply since wednesday officials said 
supplies of food products tires cable and other goods from soviet 
sources also are being curtailed 
deputy premier romualdas ozolas quoted a soviet ministry of 
transportation directive as saying that nothing can be transported 
to lithuania by railway later he said the order apparently 
included truck traffic as well 
ozolas said moscows orders to stop land shipments to lithuania 
and its diversion of shiploads of goods bound for the republic 
amounted to a full embargo 
i believe a blockade has started a total blockade 
absolutely he said 
some shipments however were still reaching lithuania he said 
moscow also is impounding checks to and from lithuanian 
factories putting a financial stranglehold on them ozolas said 
saturday is a normal working day in lithuania but ozolas said 
the majority of factories were not working 
we decided not to waste our strength while it is not 
necessary ozolas said 
traffic on the streets of vilnius the capital was light 
saturday as motorists grappled with a rationing plan that limits 
them to about 7 gallons of gasoline a month 
ozolas said some factories still open saturday would probably 
have to close down begining monday because of shortages of fuel and 
raw materials ozolas said lithuania would pay unemployment 
compensation to workers left unemployed lithuania voted march 11 
to restore the independence it lost when it was forcibly annexed to 
the soviet union in 1940 
despite military and economic pressure lithuanians have refused 
to back off their declaration ozolas said saturday that help from 
the west was crucial 
we must get support from the west if there is no alternate 
supply from the west well be nothing he said if we dont 
find such alternate supplies we can say our struggle is useless 
the neighboring republic of estonia also moving toward 
independence has offered aid to lithuania and an agreement was 
expected to be reached late saturday ozolas said estonia and 
latvia were also annexed by moscow in 1940 
also saturday a delegation from lithuania arrived in denmark 
for talks on obtaining oil to counteract the soviet blockade the 
delegation led by lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene 
met norwegian oil officials on friday 
other countries shouldnt leave us alone to solve this 
problem mrs prunskiene said 
she later appealed to european community foreign ministers 
meeting in dublin asking that they recognize lithuania as a 
sovereign nation they ignored her request but called on moscow to 
lift its blockade 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis said saturday that 
the threat we are facing is very great 
landsbergis told an opening session of a congress of the 
proindependence movement sajudis that lithuania was searching for 
a compromise with moscow but there were no proposals on the table 
asked about reports moscow was offering to negotiate if 
lithuania delayed independence for two years landsbergis said 
we havent received any kind of proposal we havent debated 
this 
but landsbergis did say some compromise ideas have been 
raised in contacts with the kremlin through middlemen he did not 
elaborate 
in a message to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev late 
friday lithuanias supreme council said the republics 
independence could not harm the soviet union and again expressed 
willingness to negotiate 
the cable to gorbachev demanded however that soviet soldiers 
who stormed a communist party printing plant friday afternoon and 
roughed up civilian guards be punished 
the sajudis congress was called to discuss changes in the 
2yearold movements strategy 
the communist party faction still loyal to the kremlin opened a 
congress of its own in the lithuanian capital saturday the 
official tass news agency said the issue of independence the 
termination of oil supplies and cutback of natural gas would be 
discussed by the 800 delegates 
landsbergis and prunskiene must resign said an ethnic 
russian worker from the port of klaipeda who identified himself 
only as alexander 
landsbergis plays the balalaika well but as a president hes 
a zero he said of the music professorturnedpolitician 
communist party chief algirdas brazauskas told lithuania friday 
that it must compromise on its proindependence decisions or face 
critical shortages of oil and natural gas in two weeks 
the price for independence must have limits brazauskas told 
the lithuanian parliament 
the energy embargo has left the republic with only 15 to 17 
percent of the 18 million cubic meters of natural gas it uses daily 
for homes and industry 
lithuania however produces more meat and milk than it consumes 
and is in no danger of starving

a man who pleaded guilty to raping a young 
woman he imprisoned in a pit behind his mobile home will be 
imprisoned himself for 20 years 
when william richard grau 48 was sentenced friday for 
kidnapping and six counts of rape prosecutors told the judge how 
he dug the 4footwide 9footdeep pit complete with a small seat 
plexiglass roof and electric fan 
we can only speculate by the way he built it in secret it was 
in contemplation of the act assistant state attorney john 
valenti said in outlining the case 
the 19yearold victim had lived with grau and his two teenage 
daughters on and off for nearly six years and even began calling 
him dad but nine hours of terror began the night of jan 9 
the woman told hillsborough county sheriffs deputies that she 
was dressing for a date when grau burst in wrapped her mouth 
wrists and ankles with duct tape and raped her in a tent pitched in 
the back yard 
after a struggle he pushed her headfirst into the 9footdeep 
hole but ultimately let her out only to rape her three more times 
she stated she kept crying and he was crying and kept telling 
her he couldnt believe he was doing this to his baby but he had 
already started and he would finish according to the police 
report 
grau then let the woman go and told her do what you have to 
do 
the retired air force technical sergeant who was managing a 
shopping mall video arcade had never been arrested before 
in accordance with his plea agreement circuit judge susan 
bucklew imposed the 20year sentence to be followed by 20 years 
probation upon his release grau is to seek treatment as a sex 
offender and can have no contact with the victim or anyone under 
age 16

it was the same street along which 
communist rulers passed on their way into town but it was a far 
different crowd that turned out saturday to cheer pope john paul ii 
during communist rule the people of prague were accustomed to 
lining lenin street the long avenue leading from the airport to 
the center of town throngs of uninterested bystanders bribed with 
an afternoon off work would show up whenever a head of state came 
to town 
but this time tens of thousands of people needed no 
encouragement as they joyfully waited for hours to glimpse john 
paul it was his first visit to eastern europe since a 
prodemocracy tide toppled the regions hardline communist leaders 
last year 
i was out here only once when gagarin was in prague said 
bystander marie martincova referring to astronaut yuri 
gagarinhe saw the stars so i thought that was a good reason to 
say hello 
she spent the entire morning standing in her sunday best for the 
minute john paul ii would pass by in his white popemobile blessing 
the crowd 
a policeman waiting in a yellow van declined to give his name 
but did not hide his relaxed mood 
he said the crowd would not be a problem after all the 
people got what they wanted 
eva hurychova a 38yearold bank accountant from eastern 
bohemia traveled to prague on an overnight train wearing a dress 
embroidered by her mother for special occasions 
they communists robbed us of 40 years of spiritual life and 
our generation should realize it is a great honor to witness this 
personally ms hurychova said 
street vendors rushed to sell the last color posters of the pope 
at a discount price as the motorcade moved toward prague castle 
hawkers sold everything from bananas and hungarian salami to 
pictures of saints 
some 5000 representatives of the countrys clergy and 
handicapped czechoslovaks received papal blessings inside the 
gothic stvitus cathedral 
it is the first time i have seen so many believers around me 
people who do not fear to show their faith said 25yearold 
martin a franciscan 
this would not have been possible several months ago he 
said 
sitting in a wheelchair kveta navratilova said the popes visit 
was an important encouragment to all who want to make sure 
czechoslovakia is not led astray on its journey to freedom 
i hope the popes visit will help stabilize the country before 
elections and unite all democratic forces so that we keep the 
communists away from power for good she added

the fate of us rep harold ford likely 
will be in a trial jurys hands this week three years after he was 
charged with taking political payoffs from two tennessee bankers 
ford a memphis democrat first elected to congress in 1974 has 
been on trial since feb 12 on charges of conspiracy bank and mail 
fraud 
i want to say now that i expect a verdict of acquittal 
exonerating me from these charges ford said friday after his 
lawyers wrapped up their closing arguments to the jury 
ford is on trial with three former aides of banker ch butcher 
jr who is serving a 20year prison sentence for bank fraud 
butcher and his brother jake a twotime candidate for governor 
also serving a 20year bank fraud sentence once controlled the 
largest chain of banks in the state but their financial empire 
collapsed in 1983 
prosecutors say ford got more than 1 million in loans from the 
butchers between 1976 and 1982 many of them allegedly intended as 
political payoffs he was not expected to repay 
ford contends his butcher loans totaled 650000 and all of them 
have been settled 
his codefendants are accountant david crabtree and lawyers 
douglas beaty and karl schledwitz who are charged with helping him 
get and hide butcher payoffs 
the government called 29 witnesses in its case against ford and 
defense and prosecution lawyers filed more than 170 exhibits for 
the jury to review 
the defense declined to call any witnesses ford said he spent 
more than 500 hours preparing his trial testimony but decided not 
to take the witness stand because he regarded the governments case 
as weak 
government witnesses outlined a complicated string of loans to 
ford on which few if any payments were made prior to the butcher 
banking collapse 
while the butchers were in control he didnt have to repay 
anything assistant us attorney dan clancy said in his 
summation to the jury 
in his closing statement defense attorney william mcdaniels 
said the government failed to show what services ford supposedly 
supplied in exchange for butcher payoffs 
prosecutors showed that ford borrowed heavily and bought 
expensive home furnishings and a 35000 car while deep in debt 
they also showed that he supported jake butcher politically but 
none of that means he broke the law mcdaniels said 
if you are to remove a political leader for his politics or 
his lifestyle that is to be done at the ballot box not the jury 
box he said 
ford the only black in tennessees congressional delegation 
contends the charges against him are the work of racist prosecutors 
who dislike him personally clancy who has denied those 
allegations has the opportunity monday to address the jury for a 
final time

red saturday was different this year 
instead of mouthing the usual praises for sovietfounder 
vladimir i lenin on his birthday party officials felt compelled 
to defend his honor and workers who voluntered for a days labor 
sent their earnings to charity instead of the state budget 
the april saturday is a decadesold cross between spring 
cleaning and solemn obeisance to the soviet founder on the eve of 
his birthday which is sunday 
millions of soviets traditionally spend the day at their 
workplaces or tidying up yards and streets under intense social 
pressure to volunteer their labor tv films banners and 
assemblies mark lenins birthday 
but this year radical legislators who made major gains in 
soviet regions in recent months have tried to turn the day into 
more of an ecological holiday than an ideological day 
the image of lenin on his 120th birthday has been severely 
tarnished as the communist party he founded loses ground in eastern 
europe and the soviet union 
on friday night president mikhail s gorbachev complained of 
slander against lenin in a speech to a holiday gala at the 
bolshoi theater 
disrespect for lenin is unacceptable he told the gathering 
slander immoral and unfounded ambitious and vulgar in its 
essence is directed at him as a person these are foolish 
attempts to cast doubt on the nobility of his aims and purity of 
his thoughts 
gorbachevs remarks and a series of impassioned defenses of 
lenin in the soviet press this week appeared aimed largely at 
parliamentarian yuri afanasyev and his backers afanasyev speaking 
to the soviet congress on march 12 in a session that was later 
broadcast nationwide blamed lenin for founding a policy of state 
terror violence and lawlessness 
afanasyev shocked and infuriated many but his remarks were no 
more outrageous than other recent published attacks on lenin last 
year a soviet journal reprinted a statement by exiled author 
alexander solzhenitsyn calling lenin an evil person 
there have also been suggestions that lenins embalmed body be 
removed from its mausoleum on red square and given a traditional 
burial 
with the most sacrosanct of soviet icons under attack lenins 
champions have launched a broad defense this months edition of 
the journal communist argued that lenin should not be blamed for 
distortions of his thoughts and proclaimed that lenin needs 
protection today 
in arguments and facts the countrys most popular newspaper 
lenins niece argued that something should remain holy in that 
interview olga ulyanova also objected to vandalism against statues 
of lenin in eastern europe 
this week deputies of the radical moscow city council raised 
proposals to remove the giant bust of lenin from their assembly 
hall and to cancel his honorary possession of deputys identity 
card no 1 
the moskovskaya pravda newspaper condemned the proposals as 
blasphemous and lamented it is so much easier to ruin 
traditions than to restore them and we have ruined so many of them 
that much is impossible to restore 
in leningrad where the new city council is also dominated by 
radical reformers deputies refused to pay for celebrations of 
lenins birthday and declared saturday an ecological subbotnik 
journalist maxim korzhov said 
residents of the city of kiev said popular movements have also 
called for subbotnik money to be spent on ecological measures 
particularly the cleanup of areas contaminated by the 1986 
chernobyl nuclear power plant accident 
workers who put in extra hours saturday insisted on earmarking 
the money for special charities including orphanages and poor 
families the official soviet news agency tass reported formerly 
earnings from the day were given to the general state budget

space shuttle columbias flight 
next month to study the cosmos may be overshadowed by the hubble 
space telescopes historic journey aboard discovery but it will 
mark a first for glasnost 
columbias astronauts plan to talk via ham radio to two 
cosmonauts aboard the soviet space station mir its believed that 
will be the first time an american and soviet spacecraft have 
exchanged direct radio communication said ronald a parise a 
payload specialist who came up with the idea 
columbias commander vance brand said he doesnt know yet what 
he will say during the brief conversation but he imagines it will 
be rather ordinary chitchat free of political overtones 
i think basically well just say hi what are you doing 
over there what sort of experiments are you working now what do 
you expect to learn hows your food he said during an 
interview friday at johnson space center 
brand wants to converse with the cosmonauts as much as possible 
in russian he was part of the apollosoyuz mission in 1975 in 
which the crews of the american and soviet spacecraft docked in 
space 
parise said he believes communications between the crews were 
handled through ground controllers on that joint mission 
brand is nasas oldest active astronaut 2 weeks shy of his 
59th birthday 
im going to be prepared to do the best i can in russian he 
said ill have to drag out some books im pretty rusty 
parise said its impossible to know when the precedentsetting 
conversation will take place during columbias nineday mission 
since nasa has not yet announced a new launch date 
in addition mir frequently changes orbits making it difficult 
to know when columbias seven astronauts will be able to make 
contact with the two cosmonauts who have been on board the station 
a few months parise said 
columbia originally was scheduled to lift off may 9 with a 100 
million observatory called astro that will measure ultraviolet 
radiation from stars galaxies and quasars but the date was pushed 
back at least a week by the delay in getting discovery off the 
ground with the 15 billion hubble space telescope nasas most 
expensive and complex payload that will orbit 380 miles above earth 
for 15 years 
discovery is scheduled to lift off tuesday two weeks after its 
first launch attempt

the airport in umtata capital of the homeland that south africa

transkeis first prime minister in 1976 matanzima and his brother 
george lost their power in a series of coups in 1987 which 
resulted in a military government run by maj gen bantu holomisa 
the army commander 
south africa has 10 tribal homelands four of them designated as 
independent the anc and some other black organizations oppose the 
homeland system because it deprives the 28million black majority

no foreign countries recognize the homelands as independent 
states

a trash fire on saturday at grand central 
terminal sent smoke billowing into the main concourse and caused 
the evacuation of about 500 people authorities said 
the blaze began shortly after 10 am under the cement slab of a 
platform on the stations upper level said john mulligan 
spokesman for the fire department he said the fire was under 
control within the hour 
homeless people were thought to be responsible for the fire 
which police considered of suspicious origin because there should 
not be any debris under the platforms said dan brucker a 
spokesman for the metronorth railroad 
virtually all trash rubbish fires not only on the tracks but 
in such areas as steam tunnels have been directly related to the 
homeless brucker said they either have started the blazes or 
sparks from the electrified third rails have set their nests on 
fire he said 
mulligan said electrical wiring and other debris was found under 
the track 
brucker said about 2000 passengers were delayed for almost an 
hour about 400 passengers were evacuated from four trains and 
another 75 to 100 people were evacuated from nearby platforms or 
the main concourse he said

lithuania is looking with increasingly 
frustration to the west for relief from soviet embargoes of goods 
ranging from oil to fish 
the west is limiting itself to lip service or statements of 
hope that the soviets will start acting better lithuanian 
president vytautas landsbergis told reporters saturday this 
could have led mr gorbachev to believe he could do whatever he 
wanted 
no foreign nations officially recognized the baltic republic 
after it declared its independence march 11 
lithuanias leaders continue looking westward for moral support 
if not material help as soviet president mikhail s gorbachev shuts 
down fuel supply lines and lithuanian factories are threatened with 
closing 
on saturday deputy premier romualdas ozolas said western help 
was critical as moscow appeared to institute a virtual total 
blockade on supplies to the baltic republic he said a show of 
support could help lithuanias cause by offering a challenge to 
gorbachev 
at least one oil tanker at the soviet border might change the 
blockade situation radically he said 
but without such help lithuania will be closed down in a kind 
of prison kept in the cold suffering from food shortages and it 
will be an interesting picture for the socalled free and 
democratic world landsbergis said 
ozolas said friday the next two to three days would determine 
whether lithuanian hopes pinned on the west were an illusion 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said president bush will 
brief congress next week on possible retaliation for the kremlins 
economic crackdown the white house is increasingly concerned 
about reports of the economic pressure on lithuania fitzwater said 
friday 
on saturday european community foreign ministers ignored a 
lithuanian request for oil but urged gorbachev to call of the 
blockade 
western diplomats in moscow have been reserved in their support 
of lithuania they have limited themselves to warning the kremlin 
that growing cooperation with the west could be damaged if the 
soviet union continues to opt for confrontation instead of 
negotiations 
one diplomat who spoke on the condition he remain anonymous 
said a major disruption in ussoviet relations could result 
the united states and most western governments never recognized 
the forcible annexation of lithuania and its baltic neighbors 
latvia and estonia by josef stalins army in 1940 
lithuanians say for many years afterward they waited for the 
west to somehow come to their rescue 
but it was the political changes unleashed by gorbachev in his 
own country and eastern europe that gave lithuania its chance 
lithuania sought official recognition from other countries when 
it declared independence but in the delicate political atmosphere 
of improving eastwest relations landsbergis said lithuanians 
realized it probably would not be forthcoming immediately 
when we started out on this form of struggle for independence 
we did not expect quick help he told the supreme council 
legislature on friday we made the decision because it was 
necessary and everything else flows from this 
landsbergis said he did not believe that international trade 
union organizations would stand idle if soviet sanctions throw

erte whose pioneering art deco designs in 
graphics fashion and theater of the 1920s returned to popularity 
in recent years died saturday a hospital spokesman said he was 
97 
a spokesman at paris cochin hospital refused to disclose the 
cause of death friends said erte was hospitalized in poor health 
three weeks ago after returning from a vacation on the indian ocean 
island of mauritius 
erte whose real name was romain de tirtoff was known as a 
painter sculptor lithographer and set designer he designed 
costumes for the legendary dancer anna pavlova and the 
performerspy mata hari 
the prolific artist designed every cover of harpers bazaar from 
1915 to 1936 
his most recent project was to design the sets for the broadway 
musical stardust some of his other major designs for sets and 
costumes included debussys pelleas et melisande and racines 
phedre 
he was also wellknown for the opulent clothes and sets he 
designed for george whites scandals the ziegfeld follies and 
the folies bergere 
he was just a genius said harris shapiro president of the 
dyansen corp gallery chain in an interview in los angeles i 
think history will reflect a few years from now that he was one of 
the greatest artists of the 20th century 
he helped pioneer art deco designs the style derived from 
cubism is characterized by slender forms and straight lines 
expressive of modern technology during the 1920s and 1930s it 
and erte regained popularity beginning in the mid1960s 
born nov 23 1892 in st petersburg russia erte decided to be 
an artist from the moment he could use colored pencils 
i was interested in fashion and even sketched a dress for my 
mother when i was about five he said 
the family expected him to follow in the tradition of serving in 
the russian navy but erte went to paris at age 19 to study art and 
changed his name from tirtoff to erte 
times were hard but he loved paris and later his parents and 
sister joined him during the russian revolution a secondrate 
french seamstress had meanwhile hired and fired him saying he 
would never succeed in art or fashion 
but he was soon working for the great designer paul poiret 
later came a major contract with william randolph hearst and 
harpers bazaar which shot erte to fame across the atlantic as 
perhaps the leading star of art deco 
about 1925 he began work on what became probably his bestknown 
works his alphabet designs the 26part series took him nearly 40 
years to complete 
the alphabet features the erte woman festooned with jewels and 
trailing feathers and furs often at the end of a diamondstudded 
leash was the ultimate art deco fur a leopard or panther 
erte became a french citizen and lived in paris most of his 
life but once said i am probably better known in the states 
the united states often honored him with big retrospective shows 
including one at the smithsonian institution and at big galleries 
all over the country during his 90th year 
in the postwar period his reputation faded and his work was 
dismissed as kitsch 
however in the mid1960s he was rediscovered diana vreeland 
the former vogue editor declared that no one in the 20th century 
had a greater influence on fashion 
ertes designs graphics and sculptures now command respectable 
prices at top galleries the metropolitan museum of art in new york 
has more than 200 erte drawings and paintings in its collection 
in later years he spent several months a year in barbados and 
majorca where he had many of his sculptures cast 
in paris he lived comfortably but modestly in a flat near the 
bois de boulogne with a view of the eiffel tower 
always appearing trim and elegant even past 90 erte kept fit 
by walking long distances but he once said he didnt start 
exercising until he was 70 
i drink and eat what i like smoke a little bit said the 
artist who looked fit at a birthday party at maxims last november 
hosted by fashion designer pierre cardin 
a lover of nature erte surrounded himself with natural forms 
like seashells and living things including a couple of 
aristocratic burmese cats and at least eight turtle doves in a 
glass cage 
funeral arrangements were not immediately known erte was never 
married and had no known survivors

who staked out his neighborhood church saturday afternoon 
the elder gotti whos used to the intense scrutiny of federal 
agents was shadowed instead by local media types desperately 
seeking bridesmaids but the press found no sign of the brides 
family or the gambino family at our lady of grace roman catholic 
church in queens 
rumors were rampant this week that the younger gotti whose dad 
is the reputed head of the nations most powerful crime family 
would be walking down the aisle saturday with kim albanese the two 
have been dating for three years friends say 
junior himself dismissed the reports 
i dont know what youre talking about he told the daily 
news you guys believe everything you hear 
his dad the dapper don wasnt wearing a tux saturday 
afternoon when he slipped out the back door of his queens home and 
zipped over to his local hangout the bergin hunt and fish club 
at the helmsley a large italian flag fluttering outside the 
building was the only thing even hinting at a bash for junior 
law enforcement officials say that the younger gotti followed 
his father in the gambino family business last year he is 26 and 
is said to be president of a brooklyn trucking company he has been 
arrested several times in bar fights

penny maple has promoted organ 
donations ever since she became the first woman to undergo a heart 
transplant in michigan five years ago now she hopes for a donor 
heart that may save her critically ill son 
maples son tom van buren entered bloggett memorial medical 
center a month ago with a worsening case of cardiomyopathy the 
same deterioration of the heart that she suffered 
maple and van buren 29 are fighting an uphill battle to 
promote organ donations in michigan according to the organ 
procurement agency of michigan the number of donated organs has 
remained at about 400 every year since 1986 but as of january 751 
patients were waiting to undergo transplants 
its ridiculous van buren said every day in michigan 
somebody dies who could be a donor and help me or somebody else 
its such a shame people are ignorant of the need for their 
organs 
i think theres concern and interest but theres a lot of 
apathy dr william lapenna a cardiologist at blodgett said of 
the lack of donors people dont realize this can happen to 
anybody it can happen to people in your family too 
because his heart is so diseased van buren was moved to the top 
of a list of 60 people in michigan awaiting a donor heart he takes 
medication to keep his heart beating and will undergo the same 
operation his mother underwent when she was 57 
we were taken back so completely that another member of the 
family could have this happen said maple who waited 6 weeks 
for a heart its almost like somebody wrote a story and wanted 
to throw in all the punches 
this is a whole new ball game maple said of her sons 
condition im the one who cant do anything the one who looks 
down through this window wondering how long hes going to be able 
to breathe ok 
maple realizes that as she waits along with her ailing son for 
the surgery that saved her life and may save his 
i dont know whether its a gift or a sentence she said 
when you get this heart you want to take care of it every single 
day and get every minute you can out of it

on a pictureperfect day president bush 
went fishing in the florida keys on saturday as the administration 
continued its waitandsee approach toward moscows economic 
squeeze on lithuania 
wish us luck the vacationing president called to onlookers 
as his party pulled away from shore on florida marine patrol 
speedboats for a daylong fishing expedition 
the sun was bright and the weather was warm 
bush clad in a green shirt camouflage pants red cap and white 
satin wyoming centennial jacket was accompanied by brent 
scowcroft his national security adviser 
his other fishing buddies were treasury secretary nicholas 
brady sen alan simpson rwyo and overseas private investment 
corp chairman fred zeder 
bush has been coming to this sportfishing haven for years 
angling for bonefish and tarpon in the sand flats and coral reefs 
the group was gone about eight hours but bush said they only 
caught a few small fish he went jogging before dinner 
as the president relaxed his administration continued 
consultations with allies about possible action against the kremlin 
for its coercion of lithuania which is struggling to break away 
from soviet control 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush would not 
be making any calls himself saturday leaving that assignment to 
other officials 
a senior us official saturday said secretary of state james a 
baker iii had had a telephone discussion about lithuania with 
soviet foreign minister edouard shevardnadze early friday 
afternoon a previous telephone conversation between the two was 
announced on wednesday 
bakers consistent approach to the soviets has been a call for a 
peaceful solution to the dispute with the maverick republic 
but the administration moved by escalating soviet pressure on 
lithuania has raised the prospect that bush will announce some 
steps against moscow this week 
the most likely course of action is in the commercial field 
such as suspending talks aimed at a trade agreement or reversing 
course toward giving moscow favorable trade status 
however bush has given soviet president mikhail s gorbachev at 
least several days of breathing room to reconsider his tactics 
after returning to washington on sunday night bush is to meet 
early in the week with congressional leaders to discuss possible 
courses of action 
fitzwater talking with reporters at a resort hotel said he 
could not provide any new information beyond his statement friday 
that the united states was increasingly concerned by developments 
in lithuania and that bush would meet with lawmakers 
officials said they did not know when that meeting would take 
place although the president has a regularly scheduled meeting on 
tuesday with members of congress 
leaving room for moscow to reverse course fitzwater refused to 
say saturday whether gorbachev had already crossed the line that 
would trigger some form of retaliation were still consulting 
he said 
on friday the spokesman had said i would assume that we would 
be prepared to announce actions fairly soon after bush meets with 
members of congress

palestinian uprising leaders in the largest 
town in the israelioccupied west bank on saturday canceled an 
order from the rebellions clandestine leadership for a twoday 
general strike arab reports said 
the orders for a work stoppage on sunday and monday were 
contained in a leaflet distributed this week by the unified 
national leadership of the uprising which closely identifies with 
the plo 
however activists in nablus issued their own leaflet saturday 
calling off the strike because of special conditions in the 
city of 120000 a palestinian journalist said 
he said it was the first time that nablus leaders canceled 
strike orders from the unified leadership 
strike days occasionally have been canceled in smaller towns and 
villages but never in nablus a stronghold of palestinian 
nationalism 
arab reports said the leaflet argued the israeli army could 
impose an extended curfew on the city in response to the general 
strike this would make it very difficult for residents to 
celebrate the end of the islamic fast month of ramadan later this 
week 
masked activists marched through the city center saturday 
announcing the cancellation witnesses said 
in the occupied gaza strip meanwhile troops shot and wounded 
at least six palestinians in clashes in the khan yunis refugee camp 
and the nearby village of bani suhaila arab hospital officials 
said the army confirmed five of the wounded 
palestinian reports and the israeli news agency itim said 
unrest began in khan yunis after soldiers intervened to save an 
arab who was severely beaten by uprising activists after he was 
caught trying to sell thousands of dollars worth of counterfeit 
jordanian dinars 
also saturday greek orthodox patriarch diodorus i led a 
procession of priests in the old walled city of jerusalem to 
protest a jewish settlement in the christian quarter 
the priests were joined by about 100 palestinian youths some of 
them masked and waving outlawed palestinian flags witnesses said 
six youths were reportedly detained by police after the march 
the church has contended the settlers are illegally occupying 
four churchowned buildings and two lower courts and the attorney 
general ordered their eviction the supreme court blocked the 
eviction until it hears an appeal by the settlers thursday

a topfloor fire routed 150 guests from a 
fivestory hotel near the las vegas strip before dawn saturday but 
fire alarms and a rapid evacuation prevented all but minor injuries 
the fire destroyed the roof and fifth floor of the 75room las 
vegas inn but only seven minor injuries were reported among hotel 
guests and 60 firefighters involved said city spokesman doug 
bradford 
the hotel had fire sprinklers on just the bottom two floors but 
the fire department had developed a firefighting plan specifically 
for the inn and the scheme was credited with saving lives and most 
of the structure 
weve done training exercises on that fire scenario we knew 
where everything was we knew the situation going into it 
bradford said 
the fire apparently began in the attic but the exact point of 
origin and cause had yet to be determined the roof fell on the 
fifth floor but lower floors had only smoke and water damage 
damage costs werent estimated 
evacuees and scores of onlookers stared as firefighters poured 
water onto the top of the hotel where the fire broke out just 
before 230 am and sent smoke billowing past the casinos of the 
glittering strip two blocks away 
all of our plane tickets and everything is in there said 
carol grass of fort bragg nc looking up to her room as charred 
shingles fell free 
we were right there she said right where those shingles 
fell 
two guests suffered smoke inhalation two had minor cuts and 
bruises and one had chest pains one firefighter sprained an ankle 
and another suffered a minor wrist injury the city spokesman said 
the fire department was called at 229 am and firefighters 
were on the scene by 235 am bradford said 
the alarms went off immediately we got a call from hotel 
security that there was a fire there they in turn evacuated the 
fifth floor he said 
firefighters checked the fifth floor found no one and hurried 
the evacuation from the lower floors the spokesman said 
guests reported that the fifth floor was suddenly filled with 
smoke and they dropped to the floor and exited saving themselves 
from smoke inhalation bradford said 
it took 40 minutes to control the fire to the point where 
firefighters could return to the fifth floor and attack remaining 
hot spots 
the city initially reported that the hotel had fire sprinklers 
that aided the battle against the flames bradford said it was 
determined later that the hotel only had sprinklers on the bottom 
floor and secondfloor mezzanine 
fire sprinkler retrofitting laws were enacted in nevada after 
the disastrous mgm grand hotel fire which killed 87 people in 
november 1980 
however the las vegas inn was exempt from retrofitting laws 
because the buildings height did not exceed 55 feet bradford said 
the hotel was inspected in january and alarms were found to be 
working

an organization of ethnic hungarians 
opened its first congress saturday only a month after bloody 
clashes between the ethnic minority and romanians in the northern 
city of tirgu mures 
security checks were carried out on all roads leading into 
oradea a city of 240000 near the hungarian border police 
patrolled the city and placed a cordon around the conference site 
and helicopters hovered overhead 
the democratic federation of romanian hungarians was to nominate 
its candidates for the countrys first multiparty parliamentary 
elections may 20 after almost 40 years of communist rule 
the 346 delegates were meeting just a month after clashes in the 
transylvanian city of tirgu mures at least seven people were 
killed and many others injured 
the ethnic hungarian federation was officially registered at the 
end of january one month after the revolution that toppled 
communist dictator nicolae ceausescu the federation which puts 
its membership at 700000 says it intends to field candidates in 
all regions 
federation chairman geza domokos said the group was set up to 
protect the interests of about 21 million ethnic hungarians in the 
nation of 23 million the ethnic hungarians are concentrated in the 
region of transylvania 
the conference was attended by representatives of the national 
salvation front which heads the countrys interim government 
opposition political parties two hungarian political parties and 
observers from the soviet and hungarian embassies 
at the opening of the congress domokos said there was no 
other alternative for romania than democracy 
switching to speaking in romanian he emphasized that where 
transylvania belongs is not at issue there is no room for 
ideas questioning the sovereignty of the romanian nation 
ethnic hungarians have been demanding language and other 
minority rights but romanian nationalists have accused them of 
secretly harboring desires for transylvania to secede from romania 
transylvania was part of hungary in the austrohungarian empire 
but after world war i the region was ceded to romania 
the ceausescu regime persecuted the ethnic hungarian minority as 
part of its official policy aimed at creating a homogeneous society 
after the december revolution the new national salvation front 
government promised to address the ethnic hungarians grievances 
but domokos told the congress that so far the front has failed 
to implement its declared policy on minorities we see only 
hesitation and uncertainty on the issue

two university of massachusetts 
researchers have been experimenting the past four years with 
inducing bacteria to grow a natural form of plastic that would be 
biodegradable 
biochemist r clinton fuller and robert lenz a polymer 
scientist brew their natural plastics in jars full of fermenting 
bacteria 
these plastics are made by microorganisms and they can be 
digested by microorganisms fuller said 
the scientists work differs sharply from the degradable 
plastics made with cornstarch that have appeared in the past few 
years those bags have come under criticism because they are mostly 
synthetic and do not degrade in landfills 
the pair have reached the point where they can produce small 
amounts of a tough clear rubbery material that is a combination of 
several types of polymers 
polymerization is the science of chaining together simple 
molecules to form a more complex molecule with different physical 
properties

police said they have intensified their 
manhunt in medellin for reputed cocaine chieftain pablo escobar 
following several bombings and the slaying of a newspaper employee 
the bogota daily el espectador whose main offices were bombed 
last year by traffickers angered by their antidrug stand was not 
distributed saturday in the northern city of 2 million following 
the shooting death friday of a deliveryman 
the newspaper said it would halt its circulation to the cocaine 
trafficking center until the lives and work of our collaborators 
can be guaranteed 
police raided private homes and offices of businesses including 
one building that contained some city government offices in the 
search for escobar said gen carlos arturo casadiego the 
assistant director of the national police 
we are giving this maximum priority he told reporters late 
friday escobar is the reputed leader of the medellin cartel which 
us officials say is responsible for much of the cocaine entering 
the united states 
police had already upgraded the search by sending 300 members of 
a special antiterrorist unit to medellin following a car bombing 
april 11 that killed 20 people including eight police officers 
casadiego also said he had ordered an investigation into the 
killing of the delivery man for el espectador 
authorities will try to determine why two policemen guarding the 
papers medellin distribution offices had left their posts shortly 
before the killing outside the offices casadiego said 
gunmen fled after they shot and killed the man charged with 
distributing the paper in the city 
the medellin cartel threatened in a recent communique to carry 
out more terrorist attacks against el espectador a leading 
crusader against the drug lords 
the delivery man was the seventh el espectador employee killed 
since the drug traffickers began a terrorism campaign in august 
the traffickers have been blamed for more than 200 deaths since 
then 
also saturday police said a group of armed men attacked a farm 
outside of medellin burning 15 antique automobiles and a luxury 
ranch house in suspected violence between rival drug traffickers 
the men used explosives to destroy the farms swimming pool police 
said 
the property located in suburban envigado is registered in the 
name of hector arango an engineer but police raided the farm two 
times last year because of suspicions that it belonged to drug 
traffickers 
a judge is deciding whether or not to expropriate the property 
arango is out of the country police said

the caribbean nation of antigua and 
barbuda plans to seek the extradition of an israeli suspected of 
involvement in a 1989 arms shipment that ended up in the hands of 
colombian drug traffickers 
it appears conclusive that one mr morris safarti was 
associated with the arms handling and can now be called upon by the 
government to account for his action prime minister vere bird 
sr said friday his remarks were broadcast on radio and television 
the cabinet has therefore advised that appropriate steps will 
be taken to extradite mr safarti to antigua with a view to 
pressing appropriate charges bird said 
the government did not say where safarti was but there were 
reports he was in the united states or israel 
it was not clear what connection safarti who owned a melon farm 
in eastern antigua two years ago had with the arms shipment 
colombian officials have said that the arms were shipped to the 
antigua and then diverted to drug traffickers working with the 
medellin cocaine cartel 
on monday bird issued a statement denying allegations that the 
countrys defense forces had first purchased the weapons 
he said saturday that the arms shipment included 
rocketpropelled grenade launchers antiaircraft guns and 
automatic rifles 
the weapons were shipped from haifa israel to an antiguan port 
and then shipped to santa marta colombia according to a 
preliminary investigation led by deputy prime minister lester bird 
the prime ministers son 
in february colombian soldiers found 232 israelimade weapons 
during a search of ranches seized from gonzalo rodriguez gacha a 
leader of the medellin drug cartel who was killed in a december gun 
battle with police colombian defense minister oscar botero said 
last week 
the weapons found included assault rifles machine guns 
submachine guns pistols shoulderfired rockets and infrared night 
scopes botero said 
he said authorities have not been determined how the weapons 
wound up with medellin drug traffickers 
bird said it has become evidentthere were irregularities 
and breeches of our customs regulations in handling the arms which 
were transshipped through antigua in april 1989 
on monday bird said that documents were falsified and customs 
procedures ignored to facilitate the passage of the arms shipment 
through antigua 
the mystery over the israeli weapons follows a scandal that 
broke last year concerning the alleged involvement of israeli 
mercenaries in training the private armies of the medellin cartel 
the colombian government has formally charged two israelis yair 
klein and arik afek with complicity with the medellin cartel 
colombian authorities have requested the extradition of klein a 
former israeli army lieutenant colonel who is in israel 
afek was found dead jan 24 in the trunk of his parked car at 
miami international airport in what police describe as a gangland 
slaying

a northwest airlines pilot who was wrongly 
accused by a passenger of being drunk has an impeccable record 
over more than 20 years of service an airline spokesman said 
saturday 
in part because of the accusation a flight from detroit to 
atlanta was delayed for nearly four hours thursday night the 
pilot who was called in after the scheduled pilot was delayed en 
route from milwaukee insisted that he be given an alcohol and drug 
test to prove he was sober 
we have had no problem with his performance with the 
company spokesman bob gibbons said of the pilot who took a 
blood test that showed he had no alcohol in his system he refused 
to identify the pilot 
the plane was delayed nearly four hours while another substitute 
pilot was found 
when the plane finally left the passenger and her husband 
stayed behind because other passengers were angry with them 
northwest spokesman douglas miller said 
the woman and her husband were subjected to quite a bit of 
verbal abuse from the other passengers and they elected not to take 
the flight miller said the couple took another flight friday 
morning 
thursdays incident occurred aboard flight 497 due to leave 
detroit at 830 pm 
as passengers waited for the substitute pilot to arrive the 
woman began talking to other passengers saying the pilot was late 
because he was probably drunk or partying miller said 
when the pilot arrived a flight attendant took him aside and 
told him of the womans concerns

if the lady wanted to speak to him miller said she did 
after hearing her accusations he insisted on being tested

of bloomfield hills a call to her home saturday was answered by 
her stepson brad beaver who said she and her husband harvey 
were in atlanta on vacation and unavailable to comment

the arrest of three northwest pilots on march 8 in minneapolis 
where they were accused of flying from fargo nd while drunk 
they were fired by the airline and face state and federal charges 
miller said the airline supports the actions of the substitute 
pilot

one of americas worst kept military 
secrets the f117a stealth fighter was unveiled saturday to a 
crowd of thousands who cheered a demonstration flight by two of the 
multimillion dollar planes 
the two batshaped planes swept in under thin cloud cover and 
passed over nellis air force base banked sharply against the las 
vegas skyline and landed to give the public its first closeup of 
the once topsecret aircraft 
there was an eerie whine as the lead craft piloted by capt 
randall peterson of rock island ill made a pass 58 feet above 
the runway the second piloted by maj steven charles of 
springfield mass then swept by the crowd circled and landed 
both jets were surprisingly quiet in flight and while taxiing to 
an area encircled by several thousand people including military 
families vips and 225 reporters and photographers including 37 
from five foreign countries 
viewing was opened to the public later and as many as 150000 
people were expected 
foreign journalists represented britain france australia 
japan and west germany asked if any soviet reporters were on hand 
tech sgt bobby shelton the stealth unit information officer 
replied they didnt ask us 
the f117a costs more than 100 million a copy according to a 
recent report by the general accounting office the air force gave 
a figure of 426 million the socalled flyaway cost of one 
plane without counting development costs for the program 
no performance details were released other than that the 
radarevading f117a is a singleseat twinengine subsonic jet 
it is a fighter in every respect peterson 30 told the crowd 
he said the jet has outstanding handling and gives the united 
states unprecedented capabilities pressed about those 
capabilities he said were not allowed to discuss any 
capability a lot of the information is still classified 
referring to an f117a nickname that has surfaced he said 
nobody that flies the stealth aircraft calls it a wobbly goblin 
also offlimits were questions on reports that a stealth fighter 
used in the us invasion of panama last year dropped bombs far 
from its target 
the bombs hit exactly where they were aimed randall said 
before another air force officer broke in and said we cant 
discuss information like that 
i only wish i could tell you what this fighter can really 
do said ben rich vice president of lockheed corp which builds 
the jet at its secret skunk works in burbank calif the 
performance is awesome and the weapons system is unmatched anywhere 
in the world 
though the fighter designation suggests dogfights with other 
planes the f117as main mission is as an attack jet it is 
designed to sneak through enemy defenses and bomb selected targets 
such as defensive radar installations the air force only recently 
lifted the shroud of secrecy on the f117a which long had been 
rumored to exist and has been flying for a decade previously only 
pictures had been shown 
the stealth fighters are attached to the 37th tactical fighter 
wing at the tonopah test range a remote airfield 140 miles 
northwest of las vegas 
most of the 2500 military personnel assigned to the program 
live in the las vegas area and commute to tonopah each week for 
their families the public demonstration was the first view of the 
plane 
the f117a is a relatively simple aircraft to fly and operate 
said col anthony tolin commander of the 37th with only three 
accidents in nine years it has the best safety record of any air 
force plane he said 
a test pilot survived the crash of the initial plane two air 
force officers were killed in other accidents during operational 
training 
a total of 59 stealth fighters have been purchased and the last 
will be delivered this fall each costs 426 million 
lt gen peter kempf commander of the 12th air force said it 
took 31 months to develop the stealth fighter compared to a normal 
aircraft development time of 10 to 12 years the first stealth 
fighter flight was in 1981 and the first production aircraft were 
delivered to the air force a year later 
the plane was flown strictly at night and over remote deserts 
until november 1988 when the air force acknowledged the aircrafts 
existence 
officials said the secrecy was lifted because the plane needed 
to start flying in daylight tonopah residents have reported seeing 
the f117a in flight for several years

lebanon the army said saturday 
no israeli casualties were reported in the raid it was israels 
first incursion north of the security zone in four months 
the military command said a force of infantryman from the elite 
givati brigade attacked a group of militiamen from the radical 
moslem fundamentalist hezbollah or party of god movement in the 
area of ein altineh village three miles northeast of the security 
zone 
lebanese police said the raid began with four israeli helicopter 
gunships firing 12 airtoground missiles into the village friday 
night killing six a police spokesman said israeli gunships struck 
minutes after hezbollah guerrillas returned to the village from 
a parade they staged in a nearby town to mark international 
jerusalem day

its fighters clashed with israeli soldiers on the northern edge of 
the security zone

hezbollah fighters at night in a hilly area controlled by the 
proiranian militiamen

area for training and launching raids on the israeli army its 
southern lebanese allies and the security zone enclave 
the soldiers returned to the security zone saturday morning the 
army said 
hezbollah has carried out numerous raids on the enclave a 6 to 
10milewide buffer strip along the israeli border the area is 
patrolled by israeli troops and about 2000 fighters of the south 
lebanon army a mostly christian israelitrained militia 
israel carved out the zone in 1985 when it withdrew the bulk of 
its troops from southern lebanon following a threeyear occupation 
the last israeli attack north of the zone was dec 26 when 
paratroopers backed by tanks killed several guerrillas belonging to 
the lebanese communist party

attacked a tunnel complex used by syrianbacked palestinian 
guerrillas above the coastal town of naameh south of beirut two 
people were wounded 
the israeli air force has carried out at least 11 strikes in 
lebanon this year killing 10 people and wounding 31

mount redoubt exploded saturday morning 
with perhaps its smallest blast to date scientists said but the 
eruption is significant because it is part of an unusually stable 
pattern 
geologist steve brantley with the alaska volcano observatory 
said the eruption at 611 am adt sent steam and ash about 25000 
feet into the air the volcano is about 110 miles southwest of 
anchorage light winds were not expected to carry ash to anchorage 
redoubts recurring stirrings happen about once every six or 
nine days and are regular enough that the observatory now issues 
warnings predicting when the next blast will occur 
its been right or nearly right at least four times since 
december 
saturdays eruption happened just six hours earlier than 
predicted brantley said scientists had set the time window from 
noon saturday to noon tuesday 
mount st helens never exhibited this kind of regular 
eruptive activity brantley said referring to the destructive 
volcano in washington state 
kilauea volcano on the island of hawaii did produce many 
eruptive episodes several dozen that occurred at varying 
intervals he said but there wasnt such a fixed pattern 
lava from kilauea destroyed three houses friday and at least one 
on saturday 
brantley says redoubt does not always give telltale warning 
signs such as heightened earthquakes at its base or discernible 
swelling 
instead scientists are adding up the number of explosions over 
a certain period and basing their predictions on the average number 
of days between explosions 
its interesting that its in this pattern brantley said 
volcanoes do not usually do this 
he said geologists were 70 percent certain that an explosion 
would occur sometime after noon saturday 
redoubt erupted less than 14 hours after a light earthquake 
shook the denali national park area some 300 miles north of the 
volcano 
there were no immediate reports of damage brantley said the two 
geologic events were unrelated

military aid program to expand the drug war in peru by helping the 
peruvian government fight leftist guerrillas who protect coca 
growers and traffickers according to a published report 
the new york times quoted a top us official in lima as saying 
the united states will build a military training base in the heart 
of the cocagrowing region to train and equip six battalions to 
provide river patrol boats and to refurbish 20 ground attack jets 
the official emphasized that in accordance with agreements 
reached at the feb 15 drug summit in cartagena colombia the 
us military would be limited to a training role 
the report in sundays editions notes that the 35 million 
figure for military aid was first mentioned last fall but that

would be spent 
the times said us ambassador thomas quainton has been 
authorized to sign an agreement with perus defense minister julio 
velazquez giaccarini that would allow money in the military aid 
package to start flowing 
in washington state department spokesman adam shub said he was 
unable to determine saturday night whether a final agreement had 
been reached or to provide details in it

fiveyear package proposed by president bush and that discussions 
on details have been under way with the affected countries for 
several months 
bush proposed 68 million for antidrug efforts in peru for 
fiscal 1990 and congress approved 47 million

every day is earth day in this tiny cattle 
and farming community in west texas 
but the 1250 folks who live here called earthlings are not 
sparing the chance to capitalize on the 20th anniversary sunday of 
the national observance of earth day 
this is the opportunity that we have been waiting for said 
noel pittman the towns earth day chairwoman this day was made 
for earth texas 
when earthlings say there is something in the air they usually 
mean dust tumbleweed or the pungent stench of cattle herds just 
east of town but this weekend they are talking about excitement 
not since a dairy queen commercial was taped in earth two years 
ago has there been such a buzz among the locals ms pittman said 
the dairy queen commercial put us on the map at least in 
texas she said most everyone from earth was in the commercial 
and people still talk about it but we are hoping earth day will be 
even bigger 
to ensure a large turnout from natives and surrounding towns 
the chamber of commerce held earth day activities on saturday 
city officials acknowledge that many of the people attending the 
outdoor ceremony came simply to mix with neighbors in some place 
other than the bank or dairy queen 
i am sure there are some people here that have no idea what 
earth day is or what it means said ms pittman but maybe the 
activities will help make them more aware if not they will have a 
great time greeting folks 
the post office is capitalizing on earth day by issuing a 
commemorative postmark 
since earth is the only town in the united states with that 
name it is the only place where an earth day pictorial postmark 
can be found said postmaster don hallett 
the postmark which is inked across stamps as a void features a 
tree outlined in green with april 22 1990 earth scripted in 
the branches 
mayor raiford daniel said he would love to see earth become the 
national headquarters for future earth day celebrations 
this could be the beginning of something big daniel said 
that is what we are hoping for if the rest of the country 
decides that we should be the focal point for earth day activities 
all they have to do is call we will be here

the united states plans to build a training 
base where us soldiers will instruct the peruvian army in jungle 
warfare to fight leftist rebels a us embassy official said 
saturday 
the new base will be built in the cocarich upper huallaga 
valley as part of a 35 million us military aid package the aid 
is one of several us measures as part of president bushs 
strategy announced in september to fight the flow of drugs from 
andean nations 
weve been building the pipeline and now its starting to 
flow said a us embassy spokesman for security reasons he 
spoke on condition his name not be used 
bush asked congress for 22 billion over five years to help 
colombia bolivia and peru fight drug trafficking the package 
apparently will come from 47 million approved for fiscal 1990 by 
congress for antidrug efforts in peru 
plans call for us military personnel to train five peruvian 
army battalions and one navy battalion that currently operate in 
the huallaga valley the spokesman said he gave no figure for the 
number of us personnel to be involved 
the base is to be built near the antidrug base at santa lucia 
250 miles north of lima in the jungle he said that base has been 
the staging ground for interdiction operations involving peruvian 
police and us drug agents against smugglers in the valley 
the base was attacked april 7 be a large column of shining path 
guerrillas no one on the base was wounded but a number of the 
rebels were believed killed 
the predawn attack was repelled by two us helicopters armed 
with m60 machine guns and flown by american contract pilots it 
was the first time any of the 10 state department uh1h helicopters 
on loan to peru for drug operations were directly involved in a 
battle with the rebels 
the spokesman said the two bases will be able to support each 
other in case of rebel attack 
we think that this will increase the capacity to deal with 
large subversive movements in the area he said 
the 35 million will also pay for weapons communications 
equipment and uniforms for the six battalions which will be 
rotated through the base in small groups the official said 
they will be provided basic counterinsurgency training to 
improve field effectiveness and efficiency in dealing with sendero 
luminoso in the valley the spokesman said 
sendero luminoso is the spanish name for the shining path 
rebels a maoistinspired group that operates in league with drug 
traffickers in the upper huallaga valley 
us officials have said the ussponsored drug fight has been 
ineffective in peru because of the lack of security in the valley 
the bush administration has insisted development aid for the area 
such as crop substitution programs be predicated on improved 
security against leftist guerrillas 
other aspects of the new program call for the united states to 
provide river boats to the peruvian navy to use in patrolling the 
extensive river systems in perus eastern jungles 
much of the chemicals used in the cocainemaking process come 
into the country from colombia and brazil by way of the many amazon 
tributaries along the borders they are also used to carry the drug 
out of the country 
the program also calls for the united states to refurbish about 
20 a37 attack jets belonging to the peruvian air force they will 
be used to provide air support in the fight against the shining 
path 
the spokesman said the training base would be built and 
operating within a few months he said plans for three other bases 
being discussed by us and peruvian officials 
the announcement of the new program comes as peruvians await the 
second round of presidential elections between mario vargas llosa 
and alberto fujimori both candidates have said they would allow 
us military personnel to come to peru for training purposes 
about a dozen green berets are training peruvian police in 
jungle warfare at a base in mazamari 180 miles east of lima

after years of sophisticated 
computerized studies a group of scholars trying to find out who 
really wrote shakespeares plays have settled on a likely candidate 
shakespeare 
students and faculty at claremont mckenna colleges shakespeare 
project presented those findings saturday said college spokesman 
robert daseler 
but one mustnt leap to the conclusion that alls well that 
ends well or even that the threeyear project turned out to be 
much ado about nothing 
for the head of the shakespeare project ward elliott still is 
unconvinced that william shakespeare knew of what he wrote said 
daseler he is only willing to concede that after three years of 
study just about all other prominent elizabethan writers that 
other scholars once thought were the real writers of shakespeares 
plays really werent and that leaves as the only serious 
contender well shakespeare 
or maybe a fairly obscure elizabethan poet named fulke 
greyville or perhaps even queen elizabeth i 
but apparently not christopher marlowe or francis bacon two 
prominent elizabethans that many scholars have long argued may have 
used shakespeares name as a nom de plume 
for nearly two centuries english scholars have debated whether 
someone with shakespeares education about that of a modernday 
high school graduate could have written plays that showed such a 
precise knowledge of falconry geography court manners and several 
foreign languages to say nothing of such a stunning command of the 
english language 
wouldnt somebody who was better educated who had gone on to 
oxford and studied greek and all these other things have been more 
likely to have written those plays asked daseler 
thats what ward a political science professor robert valenza 
a mathematics professor and several students sought to find out 
key to their research daseler said was a field of mathematics 
and computer technology called signal processing that organizations 
like the central intelligence agency use to analyze data 
using the signal processing method valenza and three to four 
students working with him analyzed shakespeares work in terms of 
some of the key words that shakespeare used frequently daseler 
said they analyzed 52 that seemed to have more than a random 
importance to shakespeare 
among the words were grief ground heaven hope lovers 
desire death tears praise secret and voice 
the researchers compared the way shakespeare used the words to 
the way other writers including marlowe bacon and greyville used 
them 
in all the researchers put more than 3 million words including 
884000 written by shakespeare into computer data banks for their 
battery of tests 
what they found was that the works of bacon and marlowe werent 
that similar to the works of shakespeare daseler said nor were 
the works of john donne edmund spenser michael drayton or edward 
devere the 175th earl of oxford all of whom have been suspected 
of being the real writer of shakespeares plays 
greyville might qualify daseler said his work showed a 
great deal of consistency with regard to shakespeares queen 
elizabeth i also showed a little bit of consistency 
but the general conclusion of most of the scholars was that 
shakespeare wrote the plays 
valenza now says he believes shakespeare wrote shakespeare 
daseler said 
ward elliott who has been heading this study up for three 
years still believes theyre going to find somebody else 
daseler added but he does admit that they have eliminated all 
the existing claimants

sandinista army troops began clearing 
out of five neutral zones saturday making way for contra rebels 
who have promised to disarm 
un observers were moving into the five security zones to 
monitor the military withdrawal and the rebel demobilization 
also saturday the 14party coalition of presidentelect violeta 
barrios de chamorro elected conservative miriam arguello as the 
head of the new national assembly 
ms arguello a 63yearold lawyer who had been jailed by the 
sandinistas after a 1988 opposition political rally 
she defeated alfredo cesar a close chamorro adviser in a 2823 
vote by deputies from mrs chamorros 14party coalition the 
united national opposition the election was seen a defeat to mrs 
chamorro 
earlier outgoing president daniel ortega bade farewell to the 
old sandinistadominated assembly saying the sandinistas will put 
the interests of the nation above those of the party 
voters weary of war and poverty put an end to more than a decade 
of rule by the leftist sandinistas in the feb 25 general 
elections mrs chamorros victory paved the way for the ceasefire 
and demobilization accord 
the defense ministry claimed the contras had violated the 
ceasefire by hijacking a truck in a remote mining region thursday 
but said sandinista troops were withdrawing anyway 
the sandinista army has begun retiring from the security zones 
to allow the members of the resistance to enter them a ministry 
spokesman capt carlos lara said saturday 
the withdrawal operation was launched thursday the day a 
permanent ceasefire in nicaraguas 9yearold civil war began he 
said 
the peace accord calls for the contras to begin disarming april 
25 the day conservative presidentelect violeta barrios de 
chamorro takes office the deadline for total demobilization is 
june 10 
the bulk of the rebel army estimated at between 9000 and 
12000 fighters has returned to nicaragua from honduran base camps 
in the past few months 
scattered strikes by sandinista workers continued saturday 
despite public appeals by ortega and lameduck interior minister 
tomas borge to end the walkouts 
labor leaders say they are conducting a twopronged campaign 
aimed at pressuring the contras into fulfilling their promise to 
disarm and at winning wage concessions from the new government 
bank workers who walked out friday were expected to return to 
work monday the sandinista party newspaper barricada said while 
telephone workers remained out 
the prosandinista media also reported strikes by miners on the 
atlantic coast teachers in some provinces ministry of 
construction and transport workers and a variety of other 
government workers 
despite the skepticism of the sandinista rankandfile party 
officials seemed confident the demobilization would go according to 
schedule 
the chief spokesman for the defense ministry lt col rosa 
pasos said that the ministry had abundant information that the 
contras are heading for the security zones ready to demobilize 
the first un peacekeeping troops were to arrive sunday in 
nicaragua from honduras where they oversaw the demobilization of 
the small contingent of contras who remained in honduras after the 
elections 
the troops all venezuelan soldiers were scheduled to deploy in 
the northernmost of the five security zones on monday said un 
spokeswoman angelica hunt 
a total of 700 peacekeepers will be deployed by next saturday 
said ms hunt who spoke in a telephone interview from honduras 
the return to nicaragua of thousands of armed guerrillas had 
provoked a crisis that threatened the peaceful transfer of power to 
mrs chamorro who is favored by washington 
the sandinistas finally gave up on their demand that the contras 
disarm by inauguration day and the contras backed off their demand 
for the army to demobilize 
the sandinistas came to power in the july 1979 popular uprising 
that toppled the rightist government of anastasio somoza and ended 
40 years of prous somoza family rule

biography written as a book can be more 
comprehensive than biography done as theater which tends to hit 
the high spots but does literally give flesh to the subject 
an example of theatrical biography titled mountain is now 
running at the lucille lortel theater offbroadway in it actor 
len cariou plays the late justice william o douglas 
its a oneman show with a chorus of two heather summerhayes 
and john c vennema become people in douglas life and speak the 
criticisms of conservatives against the liberal who was on the 
supreme court from 1939 to 1980 
in mountain one gets a feel of what was important to the 
man that constitutional rights not be taken from people no matter 
what their race politics or wrongdoing that freedom includes the 
right of privacy and that wilderness areas be protected forever 
from development 
the play by douglas scott makes douglas a fullblooded person 
and is careful to show faults not letting him be right all the 
time 
as the play begins ones heart sinks its stagey and anecdotes 
sound like toocute party pieces the ending isnt satisfactory 
either getting overheated as douglas rails extensively 
but recounted aspects of douglas life pull one into the play 
according to mountain douglas was president roosevelts first 
choice for vice president in 1944 
and cariou is touching acting douglas as a boy and later going 
from washington state to new york by train he states douglas 
convictions compellingly 
the focus wisely isnt on douglas private life his first 
wife is shown as a shy person his second less clearly as 
personable his third and fourth not detailed at all

britain on friday repeated a 10yearold offer to 
restore diplomatic relations with albania the statement from the 
foreign office came a day after albanian leader ramiz alia urged 
the soviet union and the united states to restore ties with the 
eastern european nation 
there have recently been increasing signs that albania wishes 
to play a fuller part in the international community the foreign 
office said 
we also note that mr alia in his remarks makes no reference 
to britains generous offer 10 years ago to restore diplomatic 
relations without preconditions we hope the change in albanias 
general tone will lead them to look at our offer the foreign 
office said 
in recent weeks albania has made several recent moves to 
increase ties with the west including the reestablishment of 
telephone communications with the united states and several other 
western nations 
it was announced friday that un secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar will visit albania the last bastion of hardline 
communism in eastern europe in midmay 
relations with britain were broken in 1946 after two royal navy 
vessels struck mines and sank in the corfu channel near albanias 
coast 
albania refused to pay compensation and albanian gold held in 
the bank of england was impounded

the kennedy family quietly won its fight 
friday to prevent preservationists from designating as a town 
landmark the 3 million home that once served as a winter white 
house 
the palm beach landmarks preservation commission listened to a 
report on the historical and architectural value of the seaside 
estate called la guerida but all seven members were silent 
when chairman james sullivan asked for a motion to make the report 
a part of the record 
a request for any other motions also met with silence removing 
the matter from the commission agenda 
although commission members felt strongly that the home should 
become a landmark sullivan said the kennedy familys 
intransigence and the threat of a costly legal battle doomed 
the proposal 
i think the commission did the right thing he said we 
cant act as don quixotes fighting windmills 
attorneys for the estates owner 99yearold rose kennedy said 
nothing during fridays meeting but in an april 2 letter they 
argued the commission could not legally declare the property a 
landmark because the town council denied it that status 10 years 
ago 
in 1980 the council unanimously rejected the landmark 
commissions recommendation to declare the mediterranean revival 
style mansion a landmark after an attorney for the family argued 
that the landmark ordinance violated mrs kennedys right to due 
process the kennedy family has said it wants to maintain complete 
control over the property 
the letter also said the home did not qualify as a landmark 
citing a consultants report in 1980 that declared the mansion 
built by addison mizner in 1925 as being certainly mizner at 
his poorest 
commission members however said it should become a landmark 
because of its association with president john f kennedy who held 
cabinet meetings and played touch football with family members on 
the beach three decades ago 
owners of landmark homes are required to get permission from the 
commission before making structural or cosmetic changes they also 
may be pressed to renovate if the commission determines the 
property needs work 
palm beach has designated historical status to about 130 homes 
including billionaire donald trumps maralago 
of the homes that have been deemed landmarks since the ordinance 
passed in 1979 only a handful of owners have objected sullivan 
said those owners said the landmark requirements violate their 
rights and could make homes more difficult to sell 
the kennedy home was built for redman wanamaker of the 
philadelphia department store chain members of the family 
including sen ted kennedy dmass still visit the estate but 
mrs kennedy no longer spends winters there because of failing 
health

new york city has become the robbery capital of 
the united states far outdistancing detroit which previously led 
the nation according to recently reported fbi figures compiled by 
the police department 
new yorks rate of robberies in 1989 was 1271 for every 100000 
in population police said detroits figure was 1095 and 
washington dc came in third with 1055 
the total number of robberies in new york last year amounted to 
93377 or one every six minutes an increase of nearly 8 percent 
over the previous year not surprisingly the number of people who 
want guns bulletproof vests and bodyguards also increased 
officials said 
rounding out the top 10 in percapita robberies were baltimore 
1043 new orleans 1013 boston 1011 dallas 928 los angeles 
913 cleveland 743 and san francisco 664 
to compile the rankings the police department used preliminary 
national crime figures for 1989 released by the fbi three weeks 
ago the fbis final official figures are due in august 
in other major crime categories washington was first in murder 
and new york after the greatest number of slayings in its history 
was ninth on a per capita basis police said 
new york city last ranked no 1 for robberies in 1981 when more 
than 107000 were reported said police commissioner lee brown 
police said that during the time the number of robberies 
increased the number of applications for gun permits went to 
6397 up 10 percent for the year if the trend continues the 
number will increase another 15 percent in 1990 
stephen dandrilli a security consultant whose company 
specializes in obtaining gun permits for a fee that can run up to 
4000 said friday that business has gone up 22 percent in the 
past six months 
people come in and tell me ive got to get a permit now im 
not going to wait around and be victimized dandrilli said 
about 15000 nonofficial new york city residents are licensed 
to carry guns along with nearly 12000 retired police officers 
the department said an additional 24000 residents have permits to 
keep guns in their homes or businesses

state attorneys on friday asked a judge to 
prevent a religious sect that believes a nuclear holocaust is 
imminent from occupying a large complex of bomb shelters near 
yellowstone national park 
the department of health and environmental sciences filed a 
complaint in livingston that said continued construction at the 
site could increase the chance of more pollution in the aftermath 
of a 31000gallon fuel spill 
the agency also requested that the church universal and 
triumphant be fined 50000 for allegedly violating state water 
quality laws when the fuel leaked from three underground storage 
tanks at the fallout shelter site near corwin springs 
in addition the state asked that plans for all water and sewage 
systems serving bomb shelters on church property be submitted to 
the department for review 
district judge byron robb took no action on the complaint 
state health officials said earlier they would seek an 
injunction to block further construction on the fallout shelter 
complex which can house about 750 people near corwin springs an 
estimated 30 smaller underground shelters have been built at a 
nearby subdivision 
the bomb shelters reflect the church members belief that 
nuclear war or some other global catastrophe is imminent 
the fuel spills were discovered last week and some of the 
contamination made its way to nearby mol heron creek a pristine 
spawning ground for cutthroat trout additional spills were 
reported last weekend

researchers say theyve found a new link 
between genetics and aids that could help explain why some people 
become sick soon after exposure while others stave off serious 
illness for years 
in a study of 5000 infected men from baltimore chicago los 
angeles and pittsburgh those with a particular genetic background 
tended to have a more rapid decline after being exposed to the 
aidscausing virus the researchers said friday 
it has been a point of considerable interest because the 
effects of aids differ so widely said dr june osborn of the 
national commission on aids 
the key finding is that there may be genetic differences that 
you inherit that once youre infected with hiv it increases your 
vulnerability to develop severe diseases said dr charles 
rinaldo jr an assistant professor of pathology at the university

when the brits make something for the telly 
they either do it very very well or teddibly teddibly badly when 
the bbc coproduces with us studios apparently it comes out 
looking like a highbrow love boat 
the usa networks comedyadventure miniseries tuesday and 
wednesday not a penny more not a penny less requires a 
greater suspension of disbelief than counting on the return of the 
tooth fairy when you lose your dentures 
the shows premise is that four intelligent honest men suckered 
by a crooked financier can combine their talents to scam their 
money back from him but not a penny more not a penny less 
ed asner plays the crook his victims are ed begley jr as an 
american mathematician brian protheroe as a titled british twit 
nicholas jones as a harley street surgeon and francoiseric 
gendron as a london art gallery owner 
if you can believe that these clever successful men can be 
swindled then the rest of penny will generally live up to your 
expectations 
there are some very good things about this collaboration of the 
bbc with paramount television ltdrevcom most notably the actors 
and of them most notably the eds 
asner is excellent as the mercilessly corrupt lonely financier 
harvey metcalf he subtly makes himself into a sympathetic 
character begleys loopy comic style fits in well hes the 
funniest in the ensemble 
jenny agutter who grows lovelier with time is begleys 
paramour and the very attractive maryam dabo provides a love 
interest for the viscount 
protheroe and jones have some good bits as well easily shifting 
emotional gears to cope with the very worst thing about this 
miniseries sherman yellens flawed adaptation of jeffrey archers 
flawed first novel 
yellens exposition is awful he asks an actor playing a man 
awakened by a longdistance call to say its the middle of the 
night here in england 
and then theres this but remember harvey metcalfe is 
ruthless and unpredictable 
and this you know what i think i think youre all a bunch of 
suckers 
its a tribute to the cast that they energize this enervated 
material 
the miniscams are remarkably improbable but they fly so 
smoothly under clive donners sleek direction that you find 
yourself sitting back and looking at the scenery which includes 
london monte carlo and oxford 
its easier to understand penny if you know that archer 
wrote it after nearly bankrupting himself he invested heavily in a 
canadian company that went belly up with three of its directors 
going to prison for fraud 
owing nearly half a million quid archer resigned from the house 
of commons and couldnt get a job so he wrote not a penny more 
not a penny less and launched a very successful career as a 
novelist and playwright 
in 1990 his revenge fantasy is on cable tv for anyone but 
anglophiles and archerphiles it may be a bad investment

smiling children skip along dirt 
paths kicking up radioactive dust they throw stones in their 
radioactive playground then go home for contaminated meat and milk 
since cesium strontium and plutonium descended on their 
rooftops gardens farms and schools four years ago the people of 
this byelorussian village and of scores more in the ukraine and 
russia have been prisoners of chernobyl 
they are surrounded and continously bombarded by an enemy they 
cannot see smell or hear they say their government and the world 
have all but forgotten them 
in bartolomeyevka another village a warm and hearty woman 
named tatiana t kharshunova said they did this to us and we 
had to live here not just for a month or two but four years no 
one paid attention to us 
she and her neighbors grow potatoes and barley in their gardens 
even though the radiation level is 40 curies nearly three times 
the danger level they can recite the figures like scientists but 
do not seem fully aware of the threat 
im as strong as a horse irina y kovoleva said she looked 
down at her 14monthold grandson in her arms and added hes 
strong too 
the boy and his parents were scheduled to be evacuated the next 
day 
ill cry when they leave the grandmother said the 
cemetery is nearby so ill die and go there 
nadezhda n dmitrochenko of the local governing council said she 
tries to explain the dangers of radiation but people still dont 
know what this is it doesnt glow and it doesnt whistle 
on april 26 1986 an explosion and fire destroyed one of four 
reactors at the chernobyl nuclear power plant in the ukraine 125 
miles southwest of noviye gromyki 
as the children of the village played on a sunny april day four 
years later chickens and cats darted among the green and brown 
wooden huts 
the only sounds were chickens clucking dogs barking and the 
distant roar of tractors plowing contaminated fields in the vast 
fertile plain traversed by a creek 
the official death toll from chernobyl remains at 31 but a 
soviet newspaper said last fall it had risen to 250 scientists 
still predict thousands of deaths will be traceable to the accident 
after years of passivity the people affected are speaking out 
residents of gomel the provincial capital plan a strike and 
demonstration thursday the anniversary to protest official 
handling of what the government newspaper izvestia called the 
greatest technological catastrophe in world history 
citizens of kiev the ukrainian capital 80 miles south of 
chernobyl also plan demonstratons a telethon to raise money for 
victims is scheduled in moscow 
protesters demand that officials who concealed the extent of the 
danger and delayed evacuating contaminated areas be brought to 
trial they want medical care for victims and supplies of 
radiationfree food 
about 70 percent of the chernobyl radiation fell on byelorussia 
and contaminated onefifth of the arable land an area twice the 
size of massachusetts where 22 million people live 
immediately after the accident about 25000 byelorussians were 
evacuated but only last year did officials admit the full scope of 
the contamination and decide to resettle more than 100000 more 
the resettlement will take five years and people eat and breathe 
nuclear poison in the meantime 
the program appears poorly run some evacuees are being 
resettled on land that also is contaminated and the government is 
building new homes schools and offices in areas that are being 
evacuated 
most families with young children have been moved out of noviye 
gromyki since resettlement began jan 1 
those still waiting feel abandoned and frightened they cannot 
move on their own because housing must be found for them 
we sit and cry said claudia a kostochka 75 who was on a 
bench with two other women sobbing they wont take us were 
pensioners 
i lived almost a whole century here raised a son and daughter 
here two weeks ago they closed our store so were eating cabbage 
and cucumber preserves from last year we dont know whether its 
dangerous or not but we have to eat 
a farmer said the milk from his cows was too radioactive to 
drink so he sells it to the government which makes it into 
butter he said the butter was supposed to be safe 
many others interviewed said they drank the milk because there 
was no alternative as many more said they did not bother to have 
their home produce checked at a local radiation laboratory 
soil and dust carry radioactive particles 
the only paved surfaces in noviye gromyki are one street and the 
grade school playground at no 13 lenin street winds blow dust 
from the dirt roads and fields onto the asphalt and the people and 
into their homes 
residents are warned not to gather firewood from the highly 
radioactive forests nearby burning it makes their stoves into what 
specialists have called minireactors 
villagers are supposed to wash frequently but they are allowed 
only one bar of soap a month the same as anyone else soap is 
rationed in most of the country 
each household gets 30 rubles a month from the government to buy 
uncontaminated food but it is hard to find thirty rubles are 
worth 49 at the official exchange rate but much less in reality 
in vetka a few miles south of novoyi gromyki children are fed 
clean meals at high school no 1 and the crumbling cement 
floors are washed several times a day 
outside their protection against radiation consists of paved 
playground and a 6inchhigh concrete barrier to keep them off the 
sidewalk where contaminated dirt falls from the roof students are 
supposed to rinse their shoes in a pan of water at the school 
entrance but many dont 
several students said they ignored warnings and rode mopeds in 
the forest they complained of headaches and exhaustion which they 
blamed on fallout 
to the list of ailments the chernobyl generation suffers school 
principal nikolai n shatilo added bloody noses swollen thyroid 
glands and vision loss the radiation level at high school no 1 is 
two to three times normal 
we cant provide normal conditions in school he said 
theres only one thing to do take them to a clean zone we must 
save the children they are our future 
one student said she was bitter because no one seemed to care 
not even the doctors who examine her class twice a year 
a 16yearold boy said were sick and tired of all the 
checkups what are they for all they do is keep saying 
everythings normal

construction workers erect new buildings 
in this byelorussian village even as residents prepare to flee 
because radiation from the chernobyl accident endangers their lives 
poor organization is wasting millions of rubles one agency 
continues working on construction projects planned before the 
reactor explosion and fire april 26 1986 while others evacuate 
residents of the same village 
criticism of how the disaster was handled began early the 
government came under attack at home and abroad because the 
accident was not reported for two days after the reactor had sent 
up a huge cloud of radiation that eventually worked its way around 
the world 
politicians elected under more liberal policies introduced since 
1986 say full information about radiation levels and health 
problems was kept secret 
the government lifted secrecy restrictions on such information 
last year as politicians learned more they pressed for and won 
evacuations of some of the estimated 4 million people still living 
on irradiated land 
byelorussian writer ales adamovich said the alleged coverup and 
official claims that no radiation sickness was diagnosed in 
contaminated areas amounted to a conspiracy 
the explosion immediately made very many people at many levels 
guilty said adamovich a member of the national parliament the 
reflex of underestimating the scope of the disaster worked in all 
of them because if the scope is greater their guilt is greater 
a ukrainian lawmaker said doctors joined the coverup refusing 
to register illnesses and deaths as chernobylrelated and blaming 
radiophobia instead 
they lied said yuri n scherbak chairman of a 
parliamentary committee on chernobyl they said there would be no 
effects they said all is good all is perfect and now we are 
beginning gradually and probably not fully yet to learn the 
truth that not everything is so good 
medical reports show leukemia thyroid gland malfunctions 
cancer and anemia are spreading especially among children 
no nationwide figures were available but an unreleased report 
obtained by the associated press shows worsening health problems 
among children in the vetka region 
in 1986 there were five cases of aplastic anemia marked by low 
counts of platelets needed for clotting and of white blood cells to 
fight infection by last year the number was 114 
cases of irondeficiency anemia rose in the same period from 134 
to 341 and cases of swollen thyroid glands doubled from 763 in 
1986 to 1508 in 1989 
debate has begun over what radiation level is safe the 
government contends a person can be exposed safely to 35 rems over 
his life but specialists testified before scherbaks committee 
that the standard does not account for longterm effects of small 
radiation doses 
virtually all american nuclear power plants limit exposure to 5 
rems a year according to the us council for energy awareness an 
industry group 
aside from human costs chernobyl is taking a huge toll on the 
soviet budget 
new chernobyl cleanup estimates are 30 times the original figure 
of 8 billion rubles 13 billion at the official rate of exchange 
scherbak said surveys by the three republics affected indicate the 
cost could reach 250 billion rubles 405 billion in the next 
decade 
in vetka a new communications center and three apartment houses 
are being built for whom 
i asked a party secretary once and he said we must think 
about future generations but basically its mismanagement an 
inability to plan said vetka councilman oleg s gromyko 
corruption also takes a toll the soviet prosecutors office has 
reported criminal disregard for the rules of radiation safety 
distortions in reported data on medical aid embezzlements as well 
as violations of the rules of paying compensation 
press reports said some officials used chernobyl cleanup money 
for a sea cruise 
izvestia the government newspaper reported in october that 
contaminated meat was mixed with clean meat at a packing plant 
and made into sausage

gene young is 39 and a professor at 
jackson state university but give him an instant and he is 19 
again a student on the same campus and gripped by fear 
he hears again repeated rifle blasts shattering the 
shirtsleevemild night air he remembers the screaming and crying 
he can see the broken glass and the blood 
and young remembers first word that a jackson state college 
student had been killed as police in riot gear fired on a cluster 
of students gathered in front of a womens dormitory to protest the 
vietnam war and the deaths 10 days earlier of four kent state 
university students 
a high school student who was crossing the campus was also 
fatally wounded 
classes were dismissed commencement was canceled and most 
students left for home but young a jackson native stayed on the 
innercity campus several days i felt something had to be 
done he recalled in an interview 
what young did was convince city high school students they 
should boycott classes until after phillip l gibbs 21 and james 
earl green 17 were buried 
young said he is still trying to figure out what happened 
to this day i dont know what could have precipitated that 
kind of violence said young a professor of speech and dramatic 
arts 
the night of may 14 1970 was the third in a row of campus 
demonstrations and offcampus disturbances at mostly black jackson 
state students were agitated and upset about the shootings at kent 
state which occurred when national guardsmen fired on a crowd of 
antiwar demonstrators 
students also were fed up with the racial epithets shouted from 
cars by white west jackson residents who drove straight through the 
jackson state campus on busy lynch street to reach downtown 
the atmosphere was very charged recalled john a peoples 
jr president of jackson state from 1967 to 1984 but i had 
from the very beginning given the students a lot of freedom 
he and young blamed racial intolerance for the shootings the 
citys and states white officials never wanted black students to 
demonstrate peoples asserted 
young concurred mississippi went to a great extent to show 
how they would keep niggers in line if they were disorderly he 
said 
young also believes the jackson state shootings would largely 
have been ignored if not for what happened at kent state 
we know the history of blacks being victimized by whites in 
mississippi he said had the incident not occurred a week 
after kent state it would have been all but forgotten 
over the years that has been borne out people remember kent 
state but they dont remember jackson state 
the night gibbs and green were killed 22 police officers in 
full riot gear advanced on the students milling outside the 
alexander residence center some reports counted 75 to 100 students 
in front of the dormitory police said the number was closer to 400 
a voice on a bullhorn ordered students to disperse then the 
shooting began 
in 25 seconds gibbs and green were killed and seven others had 
been wounded an fbi report counted 275 holes in the west wing of 
yellowbrick alexander hall 21 were believed caused by automatic 
weapons 250 or more by shotgun buckshot every window on the 
street side of the fivestory building was blown out 
their intent was not just to disperse the crowd but to bring 
death and destruction young said it amazes me that no more 
people were killed 
that nights demonstrations had begun after students were drawn 
outside to watch firefighters douse a burning dump truck on an 
adjacent street 
city and state officers were called to the scene after 
firefighters were pelted with rocks and bottles thrown some say 
by neighborhood residents 
whatever the students started the corner boys took up 
peoples said at night you couldnt tell the corner boys from 
the students 
officers claimed they opened fire after a sniper shot from a 
dormitory window and a highway patrol officer was hit by an object 
thrown from the crowd 
to that young commented the elusive sniper always amazes me 
how he gets around the world 
and students suggested at the time that what police took to be a 
gunshot might have been the sound of a soft drink bottle smashing 
on a sidewalk after it was dropped from a dorm window by a student 
who saw the advancing officers 
families of the dead and injured sued the city of jackson and 
the state of mississippi but a federal appeals court ruled in 1974 
that damages could not be awarded because it was impossible to 
determine who was to blame 
however the court did say that the barrage of gunfire far 
exceeded the response that was appropriate 
the presidents commission on campus unrest said police had 
fired blindly into the students and no evidence was found of any 
sniper the commission said the blame lay jointly with public 
officials students and college administratiors 
i didnt think anyone would be punished for it in the first 
place nureen gibbs ray sister of phillip gibbs said from her 
home in ripley they said there was an investigation but i dont 
think there was ever anything concrete 
gibbs was a junior prelaw student he had a pregnant wife and 
child back home in ripley his wife has since remarried changed 
her childrens last name and lives in arizona 
green was a track star at jim hill high school he was crossing 
the jackson campus after getting off work 
ray said gibbs had called her that night to let her know about 
the disturbances on campus but said he and their sister mary also 
a jackson state student would be leaving for home soon the 
siblings parents both were dead 
his car already was packed he had gone up to get our sister 
because they were coming home ray said 
mary she said lives in chicago and doesnt like to talk about 
that night 
dr roland colom a columbus dentist attended junior high with 
gibbs and was his roomate at jackson state it was really strange 
for me to hear that he was out there amid the demonstrators 
because i was out there the night before and tried to get him to go 
out and he wouldnt colom said 
jackson state has grown from 3700 students in 1970 to more than 
7150 today 93 percent of them black lynch street the 
thoroughfare that once split the campus is closed replaced by a 
plaza in front of the alexander complex 
after several years of commemorating the shootings the 
ceremonies stopped but young is head of a committee planning a 
special 20th anniversary program next month 
young said hes satisfied that race relations in mississippi 
have improved but he doesnt believe the state has ever repented 
for the shootings 
no one has ever apologized he said in that regard 
mississippi still bears the guilt of that incident

comes arbor day 
remember arbor day a tradition started in 1872 it is one of 
the oldest formalized conservation observances in the world its 
occasion has resulted in the planting of millions of trees in this 
country through 10 generations 
god also said i give you all plants that bear seed 
everywhere on earth and every tree bearing fruit which yields

the importance of trees 
but not since the legend of johnny appleseed tagged after john 
chapman a massachusetts farmer who gave up the plow to sow 
orchards from the allegheny mountains to indiana after the 
revolution has tree planting become so trendy 
a tree planted today can enrich the lives of generations yet 
unborn president bush said march 22 when he planted an eastern 
red bud on the white house lawn so let us plant the trees and 
nurture them so that america will remain america the beautiful for 
generations to come

bush who wants to plant a tree in every state last april 
personally turned the dirt for an offspring of the adams elm on the 
grounds of the north dakota capitol in bismarck 
but before the presidential spade tapped down the roots 
horticulturalists had to take emergency action against gypsy moth

but bush is not tackling his goal singlehandedly in his 1990 
budget he asked congress for 175 million to plant 1 billion 
trees he has called on fellow citizens to plant 10 billion trees

arbor day as with most great causes began as one persons 
vision and became an official holiday long before ecology was a 
buzz word 
in 1854 julius sterling morton son of a wealthy new york 
merchant left the cultured east with his bride of a few hours and 
headed for the nebraska territory they settled on a treeless 
160acre homestead outside nebraska city 40 miles south of omaha 
on the missouri river 
just 3 percent of the vast territory was wooded fierce prairie 
fires and roaming buffalo made trees so scarce they became 
landmarks such as travel two days until you get to the tree 
it is claimed that lone tree neb was named for a single huge 
cottonwood on the ox bow trail 
nebraskaborn author willa cather in my antonia described 
the czech farm girl antonia showing a friend her farm north of 
red cloud 
as we walked through the apple orchard antonia kept 
stopping to tell me about one tree or another i love them as if 
they were people she said rubbing her hand over the bark there 
wasnt a tree here when we first came we planted every one and 
used to carry water for them too there was the deepest peace 
in that orchard 
j sterling morton resolved to change the landscape he and his 
wife carrie planted their own apple orchard at the state fair in 
1869 morton and 22 other men organized the nebraska state 
horticultural society 
on jan 4 1872 morton presented his fruit address to his 
colleagues urging them to plant trees 
orchards are missionaries of culture and refinement they make 
the people among whom they grow a better and more thoughtful 
people if every farmer in nebraska will cultivate an orchard 
and a flower garden together with a few forest trees this will 
become mentally and morally the best agricultural state the 
grandest community of producers in the american union 
and it was done the nebraska board of agriculture declared 
april 10 that year to be arbor day on that first observance more 
than 1 million trees were planted in nebraska astonishingly as 
many as 100 million trees were planted annually in that prairie 
state from 1885 to 1890 
by 1900 arbor day was celebrated in every state and the idea 
had spread overseas as the treeplanting ritual became a fixture 
in the american school year morton declared other holidays 
repose upon the past arbor day proposes for the future

today national arbor day is the last friday in april although 
many states plan observances to coincide with the planting season 
south carolinas arbor day is the first friday in december while 
alaska deems the third monday in may auspicious 
exactly 100 years after morton first exhorted his colleagues 
about planting more trees john rosenow born fittingly in 
elmwood neb was asked by thengov james j exon to plan the 
states arbor day centennial 
rosenow the new tourism director was only 21 and fresh from 
the university of nebraska when he accepted the task he started 
the national arbor day foundation with 10000 and a staff of one 
himself 
today almost 900000 members make the foundation second only to 
the national wildlife federation as the nations largest 
environmental organization members pay 10 to join 15 annual 
dues thereafter and receive free of charge 10 seedlings from 6 
to 12 inches in varieties suited to climate more than 40 million 
trees have been given away since 1972 
rosenow now 40 the foundations executive director since 1979 
has spent half his life guiding it into an international 
environmental force he has a theory on its success the magic of 
planting a tree and caring for it is something each and every 
person can do to make a difference it empowers people the same way 
a spark can light a bonfire 
often that experience comes in childhood he said and it 
can touch off a tremendous latent desire in people to make a 
positive contribution to the world they live in 
when christ walked the earth many forestdwellers believed gods 
lived in trees the gauls worshiped oak sacred trees guarded 
entrances to chinese villages egyptians left offerings of raisins 
to sycamores american indians believed each tree had its own 
spirit 
when you think about tree rings you have to have sense of 
reverence said rosenow a 4000yearold sequoia may be 
onethird as old as civilization itself 
treehuggers everywhere know the ditty by joyce kilmer 
i think that i shall never see 
a poem lovely as a tree 
poems are made by fools like me 
but only god can make a tree 
recite it on arbor day as you dig the hole and then commit 
this a poem entitled an arbor day tree author unknown to 
memory 
dear little tree that we plant today 
what will you be when were old and gray 
the saving bank of the squirrel and mouse 
for the robin and wren an apartment house 
the dressing room of the butterflys ball 
the locusts and katydids concert hall 
the schoolboys ladder in pleasant june 
the schoolgirls tent in the july moon 
and my leaves shall whisper right merrily

president bush to hear some democrats tell 
it doesnt make a move without checking public opinion polls first 
and even then he acts timidly 
republicans along with a number of political analysts counter 
that bush is getting a bum rap on the issue even a few democrats 
say the same 
i dont think he can be accused of governing by the polls any 
more than any other modern president said democrat stuart 
eizenstat domestic affairs adviser to former president jimmy 
carter 
all presidents should be responsive to public moods eizenstat 
said a president after all is not a dictator 
political scientist larry sabato of the university of virginia 
said i think bush is more contemptuous of polls than either 
ronald reagan or carter less likely to trust them or to use them 
in decisionmaking 
thomas cronin presidential scholar at colorado college said 
i think he reads them just as any good president should to say 
he follows them constantly and is tied to them is wrong 
and john sears a republican political consultant said by 
general nature bush is cautious i dont think thats because of 
something he read in the polls 
yet even those who defend bush say the president should risk 
his high ratings occasionally to take a bold stand on a tough 
issue such as the federal deficit 
the best use of presidential popularity is to achieve 
something now rather than to husband it because it could all 
disappear overnight sabato said 
an activist president would be putting this to work cronin 
said but bush is a cautious president and moves more slowly 
i wish he would be leading more 
on the other hand sears said no president is going to get 
accused of making a terrible blunder by not doing very much 
bushs supposed obsession with polls got a lot of attention when 
house majority leader richard gephardt in a speech recently 
attacked the president as timid and unimaginative 
the maxim of the bush presidency seems to be do polls risk 
nothing gephardt said he said bush is running a government of 
the polls by the polls and for the polls 
in response bush said hes learned not to trust polls and 
doesnt shape his decisions by them thats not the way i try to 
call the shots on the policy he said 
robert teeter who conducts polls for the white house called 
gephardts accusation bunk he said bush is interested in the 
results but is not a great poll fanatic 
there was no decision where we went out and did a poll to shed 
some light on what we should do he said 
in the reagan white house a national sampling of public opinion 
was conducted at least once a month and more frequently during 
times of crisis said tom griscom who was reagans communications 
chief 
teeter said he conducted only three or four polls for bush last 
year usually at good summingup times they are done under the 
auspices of the republican national committee 
teeter said he occasionally tags white houserelated questions 
onto other polls he does for the gop one polling source said such 
questions are added to surveys every month 
the rnc also plays a big role in helping the white house track 
public moods following all public polls such as those done by the 
media as well as surveys taken by gop organizations and candidates 
throughout the country 
a lot of the information is funneled to the white house 
we share a lot of it with the political office over there at 
the white house said rnc spokesman b j cooper 
teeter said democrats in criticizing bush are trying to 
suggest he has no personal convictions lacks ideas and is not a 
strong leader 
i dont know why its wrong in a democracy to pay attention to 
what the people want you to do teeter said 
to the dismay of democrats bush after 14 months in office has 
the longest running set of high poll ratings of any president in a 
quarter century 
bushs popularity shot up to 80 percent in january after the 
invasion of panama since then it has tapered off to the high 60s 
and low 70s still a lofty rating 
its peace prosperity and the collapse of communism said 
political scientist sabato 
gephardt has been prodding bush to risk some of his popularity 
to summon the nation to meet new challenges on the horizon 
other democrats have issued similar challenges 
even the gops sears said i dont think theyre missing the 
mark 
if you look below the first level of the polls people perhaps 
dont think hes active enough sears said in politics its 
always a matter of compared to what there is no other 
individual no reaction by the opposition party to fill in 
whats the alternative 
where is the democratic party out to lunch complained duke 
university political scientist james david barber 
referring to bushs high ratings eizenstat said i think hes 
just sitting on it how does that help bush it gets him 
reelected eizenstat said

the bush administration is proclaiming victory 
with a new agreement to dismantle japanese trade barriers but 
skeptics warn remember townsend harris 
harris was the american consul general sent to tokyo in 1856 to 
implement the first usjapan market opening agreement that deal 
struck by commodore matthew perry sought to end 300 years of 
japanese isolation and open the country to trade 
but when harris arrived the japanese at first wouldnt even let 
him off his ship in the end all the issues that perry thought had 
been resolved wound up being renegotiated or simply ignored by the 
japanese 
now 134 years later a debate is raging in washington over 
whether the latest marketopening pledge by the japanese should be 
viewed any differently than the countless agreements that went 
before it 
skeptics including numerous members of congress argue that 
nothing fundamentally has changed and the new pact will do little 
to lower americas huge 49 billion trade deficit with japan 
supporters of the agreement including president bush contend 
that the new structural impediments initiative does herald the dawn 
of a new era in japan they believe prime minister toshiki kaifus 
government is serious about harnessing consumer discontent to push 
through fundamental changes in the way japan operates 
whichever side is right the sii talks at least in their early 
stages seem eerily reminiscent of past negotiating triumphs 
interminable discussions take place with the japanese resisting 
what they term exhorbitant american demands the japanese finally 
make grudging concessions but only at the 11th hour when faced 
with a threat of economic retaliation from an outraged congress 
in past deals the japanese later disputed americas 
interpretation of the commitments and the usjapanese deficit 
climbed ever higher 
the new deal seeks to attack broadbased structural barriers to 
trade it proposes to expand opportunities for american and other 
foreign companies to do business in japan by eliminating red tape 
and by breaking down the cozy relationships that exist between 
japanese companies 
the administration believes the pact is historic in the number 
of commitments obtained from the japanese but veterans of past 
negotiations say many of the items were addressed in earlier 
marketopening efforts undertaken by the reagan administration 
these talks are a dangerous charade they are always presented 
as a final solution to the problem when in reality they are about 
act 25 in a longrunning play says clyde prestowitz a top trade 
negotiator in the reagan administration we keep claiming 
victory victory victory and nothing much happens 
among the previous agreements cited by prestowitz and others 
five marketaccess packages issued by the japanese 
government from 1981 to 1984 they covered a wide range of products 
but produced few tangible results in increased us sales often 
the japanese concessions repeated changes which had been promised 
in earlier packages but never implemented 
the 1985 moss talks for marketoriented sector selective they 
were designed to address broadbased barriers in four specific 
industries forest products medical equipment pharmaceuticals 
and electronic products wags dubbed the discussions more of the 
same stuff because the japanese repeated the pattern of offering 
lower trade barriers but failing to fully implement them one of 
the areas forest products is currently the subject of intense 
bargaining as negotiators replow ground supposedly covered five 
years ago 
the 1986 maekawa report named for former bank of japan 
president haruo maekawa called for broad structural change in 
japan the report was issued the same year that the reagan 
administration was engaged in the structural dialogue discussions 
attempting to reconcile the differences in economic systems between 
the united states and japan these talks following the pattern of 
a 198384 series of discussions degenerated into an examination of 
vague macroeconomic principles some trade experts see these talks 
as very similar to the current sii discussions 
and the result so far from all of this torrent of words the 
usjapan trade deficit which totaled what seemed an alarming 
158 billion in 1981 stood at 49 billion in 1989 representing 
threefourths of americas nonoil trade deficit 
it is this outcome that has contributed to widespread cynicism 
on capitol hill over the new trade agreement 
senate finance chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas likened japans 
negotiating efforts to a drugstore cowboy all hat and no 
cattle house majority leader richard gephardt dmo dismissed 
the sii agreement as an exchange of press releases 
the administration insists that things are different this time 
around noting recent polls showing that japanese consumers who 
currently pay prices up to 70 percent higher than american 
consumers want reforms to open up competition in their country 
we think we have a very good blueprint for action and we got a 
good down payment said us trade representative carla hills 
however some members of kaifus liberal democratic party have 
warned that if the japanese leader pushes too far with the reforms 
it could topple his government 
already politically powerful groups representing japans 2 
million small retail stores have come out strongly against one key 
element of the agreement that would reduce the time it takes to 
open large retail stores from as much as 10 years down to 15 years 
many members of congress are urging the administration to keep 
the pressure on japan by citing tokyo for a second year as an 
unfair trader under a tough section of the 1988 trade act that 
provides for economic sanctions if barriers are not removed 
the administration which has until april 30 to issue its new 
trade hit list has refused to say whether japan will be on it 
the structural barriers report issued on april 4 was only an 
interim agreement the final report is due in july and many in the 
american business community believe that it must contain language 
spelling out how the commitments will be monitored and enforced if 
the talks are to produce a turning point in usjapan relations 
but at least some private economists are encouraged 
you dont change a society overnight but it would be 
erroneous to say nothing has changed said c fred bergsten head 
of the institute for international economics a washingtonbased 
research group

todays tip for stockmarket anglers if you 
want to go bottom fishing right now try the banks 
in a generally stagnant market over the past several months few 
industry groups have sunk so low as the shares of banking 
institutions especially those of the big international banks and 
many regionals operating in the eastern part of the country 
in the 12month period ended in midapril dow joness index of 
eastern regional banks dropped 3386 percent to rank dead last 
among 82 stock groups tracked by the financial publishing company 
money center banks in new york and other centers of 
international banking activity didnt fare much better running no 
68 with an 1145 percent decline 
there is a long and wellpublicized list of reasons for the 
stocks depressed state of course industry profits have been 
riddled by bad loans to foreign countries to highrisk companies 
and to realestate ventures gone sour 
the question now up for debate among wall street analysts is 
whether the worst is still to come for the stocks or whether the 
pessimists on the group might have gone overboard 
bank earnings are experiencing a recession even if the us 
economy is not says arthur soter an analyst at morgan stanley amp 
co in a current report on the industry we expect disappointing 
earnings to persist a while longer before beginning to look up 
later this year 
some rude surprises were in store for anyone who started 
speculating a few months ago on the prospect of an eventual banking 
recovery 
last week for example there was the news that moodys 
investors services was reviewing its ratings of some of the debt of 
citicorp one of the nations biggest bank holding companies 
in another development earlier in april statements from federal 
regulators raised the specter of a long and stringent crackdown on 
bank lending practices 
in that kind of climate many banks seem to be bending 
backwards to avoid making any type of loan they might live to 
regret said analyst theresa brophy in the latest appraisal of 
the industry by the value line investment survey 
with commercial loan demand soft and real estate lending 
offlimits to many banks very profitable consumer lending is 
getting a lot more emphasis she added unfortunately theres 
just so much consumer loan demand to go around 
as cheap as bank stocks may be value line rates them no 
better than 87th out of 96 groups it follows for likely performance 
over the next 12 months 
bank earnings which fell sharply in 1989 arent likely to be 
especially strong in 1990 the firm said sources of revenue 
seem to be drying up meanwhile its unclear whether problem loans 
have topped out or not more reserves may be needed for loan 
losses 
similary cheryl swaim who follows banks for oppenheimer amp co 
urges a cautious approach 
even though the stocks are down already we believe good news 
is necessary to drive them higher she said furthermore it 
will take time to turn around the troubled real estate market 
soter at morgan stanley takes a more venturesome view we 
believe the pressure of tighter regulatory supervision will induce 
bank managements to flush out problem credits faster than they 
otherwise would penalizing 1990 earnings but reducing 
uncertainties he said 
we believe the stock market has largely if not completely 
discounted the underlying reality of bank loan portfolios 
in general we believe bank stocks are bottoming and pose much 
less downside risk than the overall stock market

renewed inflation and interestrate worries are 
threatening to spoil the view as wall street looks ahead to 
mid1990 and beyond 
to judge from the latest inflation statistics a long spell of 
sluggish growth in the economy has not yet subdued upward pressures 
on the cost of living enough to satisfy the federal reserve board 
bond traders who often match or exceed the fed in their 
antiinflationary zeal have wasted no time in recent days 
registering their displeasure with the way things are shaping up 
the result has been a new rise in interest rates that has 
dampened hopes for an improvement in business activity and 
corporate profits as 1990 progresses 
the government provided the latest reference point in the debate 
over the inflation outlook this past week when it reported that the 
consumer price index rose 05 percent in march 
that put the increase in the cpi for the first quarter of 1990 
at an 85 percent annual rate a figure that sat well with hardly 
anybody in the financial world 
optimistic analysts quickly issued assurances that inflation 
wasnt likely to keep up that pace for long among battered bond 
investors the attitude seemed to be it had better not 
interest rates on longterm treasury bonds climbed close to 9 
percent hitting their highest levels in almost a year 
unfortunately as we see it the risks to inflation remain 
very much on the upside said stephen roach economist at morgan 
stanley amp co 
with worries like that to contend with the stock market 
suffered a broad setback in the past week the dow jones average of 
30 industrials which had risen 4752 points over the three 
previous weeks tumbled 5585 to 269595 
the new york stock exchange composite index fell 474 to 18406 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market lost 
1052 to 42579 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was down 992 at 34796 
volume on the big board averaged 14902 million shares a day 
against 13363 million the week before 
to some observers talk of revived inflation still represents a 
red herring distracting investors from problems capable of causing 
very different kinds of mischief 
the banking system for one thing is undergoing a squeeze on 
lending that hardly paints a picture of an overheating economy 
theres nothing inflationary they add about the depressed 
state of the real estate market in many areas of the country 
analysts at wright investors service in bridgeport conn 
voiced some doubts about the elements of the march consumer price 
data showing higher prices for houses and clothing 
these increases do not square with the weak trends in retail 
sales and housing construction wright said furthermore 
marchs cpi does not reflect the latest round of weakness in oil 
prices 
but roach says the inflation outlook doesnt get much brighter 
if you exclude fluctuations in prices of energy and food to 
calculate a core inflation rate which was up 07 percent in 
march after climbing 11 percent in the first two months of the 
year 
looking at the numbers minus food and energy makes sense roach 
maintains not because food and energy are unimportant but 
because their variations are typically driven by forces outside the 
economic sphere reflecting trends in weather politics and the 
like 
the march report hardly offered the break in core inflation 
that we were anticipating he concluded we think the cpi 
report is a clear warning shot

for 20 years alan hackel depended on his bank to 
supply a credit line that was the lifeblood of his distributing 
business 
he would use loans to buy furniture and other merchandise from 
manufacturers and would repay the debt with money he made by 
selling the items to retailers hotels and restaurants 
but that arrangement came unglued several months ago when the 
bank told hackel he would have to find a new lender 
i was never late on a payment not even close hackel said 
all of a sudden one day they come to us and say they can no 
longer maintain our loan 
such scenes have become more common across new england in recent 
months business leaders say small companies are suddenly finding 
their credit cut off as banks feel pressure from financial losses 
and government scrutiny 
to a large extent this reflects a tightening of the banking 
industry nationwide last week federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan said a majority of banks have become much less willing to 
make loans due to the weakening economy rising numbers of bad 
loans and closer scrutiny by bank regulators 
but the impact is particularly acute in economically depressed 
new england and some experts say it threatens to make the 
situation worse they have trouble agreeing on who is responsible 
some point to bankers who have grown more cautious after getting 
burned by aggressive real estate lending others blame regulators 
for excessive toughness after witnessing banking debacles in the 
southwest 
at the precise time that the economy is getting soggy banks 
are forced to become stingy said gary ciminero chief economist 
for fleet norstar financial group in providence ri this bridge 
across troubled waters namely credit availability is being pulled 
away 
figures from the fed reflect how credit has decayed from 1984 
to 1988 when new england was enjoying an economic boom commercial 
and industrial lending in the region more than doubled to above 38 
billion 
since then the economy has stumbled and taken the lending with 
it the most recent figures available from the middle of last 
year show a decline of 2 percent 
experts say small businesses have suffered the brunt of the 
credit crunch because they tend to rely more heavily on bank loans 
for daily operations 
if youre trying to expand and all of a sudden you find things 
are shut off its a time of tremendous difficulty for a small 
company said lewis shattuck president of the small business 
association of new england theres a lot of anxiety out there 
hackel who employs a dozen people at rr scheibe co in 
brockton was well acquainted with the feelings of anxiety 
if you want to talk about mental anguish and sleepless nights 
and recurring ulcers i think i asked myself many times what my 
options were he said 
hackel finally found a bank that would pick up his credit line 
but only at 400000 rather than the 700000 he previously had 
been granted 
its probably going to make me watch my pennies a lot more 
carefully he said 
dozens of other business owners are similar positions john 
gould president of associated industries of massachusetts said 
his group has found 154 small and mediumsize companies hurt by 
credit shortages in some cases the credit has been lowered in 
others it has been eliminated 
gould and other business leaders aim their wrath at what they 
call suddenly overzealous regulators but the regulators say the 
rising number of troubled loans is due to difficult economic times 
not unusually stringent standards 
its not like we reached into a hat and decided to crack down 
on these guys said frank vance a spokesman for the us 
comptroller of the currency 
some economists also question how much the economy is further 
harmed by the withdrawal of credit 
the economy is like a giant ship its tough to turn it 
around said gerard cassidy an analyst at tucker anthony inc 
lets say they let all the marginal developers have money i 
would say there would still be serious economic problems in new 
england

when johnson controls inc sought to hide 
development of a 20 million nextgeneration building automation 
system it started a diversion campaign to dupe a leading 
competitor honeywell inc 
johnson controls took a slight modification of an existing 
product and promoted it in a flashy advertising campaign 
the tactic bought the company time to finalize its new building 
automation system which integrates computers and other digital 
technology to control heating security and other functions in 
buildings 
the johnson controls diversion is an example of how companies 
often take extraordinary measures to protect their concepts 
blueprints and experiments alarms guards padlocks and patent 
attorneys tell only part of the story 
theres also a chessgame cloakanddagger side to it as well 
with weapons that range from phony publicity to secret codes aimed 
at throwing the other guy off your scent 
estimating how much those efforts cost is difficult 
i dont think its a budgetary thing said ronald j 
caffrey vice president for marketing at johnsons controls group 
you cant put up an electronic security fence its more of a 
people thing 
mike bernaden an advertising executive who devised johnson 
controls diversion campaign is a veteran in the trade secrets 
field he regularly scrutinizes visitors name tags at at trade 
shows and eliminates from johnson control mailing lists any 
competitors posing as customers 
anytime you go to a trade show or are involved in any 
communication activity theres a certain recognition of your 
competition and their attempts to get information bernaden said 
milwaukeebased johnson controls spent three years and 20 
million developing the new metasys automation system which was 
given the code name loba after the 19th century russian 
mathematician nikolai lobachevski 
although the company used the code and made all suppliers 
customers and employees swear to secrecy johnson controls still 
sensed honeywell had learned a major development was in the works 
bernaden said 
johnson controls mulled introducing metasys earlier than 
planned but didnt want to risk imperfections so bernaden 
developed what he called a grand strategy to create a 
smokescreen 
he took the slightly modified product called it lobo for 
logical option for building systems and used a splashy news 
release complete with helium balloons to promote it 
the diversion received thorough coverage in trade publications 
distracted honeywell and gave johnson controls time to finish 
finetuning the metasys system before it was unveiled at an atlanta 
trade show in february 
martin a mcdevitt an analyst with the milwaukee firm cleary 
gull reiland mcdevitt amp collopy said metasys probably would give 
its creator a larger share of the 2 billionayear building 
controls market johnson controls and honeywell now each control 
about 30 percent of the market 
code names confidentiality and clearance systems are among the 
more obvious trade secret tactics but some companies wont even 
talk about how they throw off their competitors 
for very obvious reasons we as a matter of practice dont 
discuss security and security methods said george jamison a 
spokesman for general electric co in fairfield conn 
sometimes tradesecret paranoia reaches levels that embarrasses 
the companies themselves in october 1987 for example eastman 
kodak co protested the enrollment of a student from kodaks 
archrival fuji photo film corp at the university of rochesters 
business school many of the students classmates would have been 
kodak employees enrolled at the school 
kodaks behavior caused an academic uproar the company 
apologized and withdrew its objection but by then the fuji 
employee had decided to enroll elsewhere 
many companies have ethics codes forbidding employees from 
actively trying to uncover competitors trade secrets 
honeywell officials said its ethics policy kept it from snooping 
in johnson controls business during the metasys affair although 
they knew something was developing 
we actively instruct employees to treat competitive 
information as the property of others not to be solicited by 
honeywell employees said paul towne honeywells director of 
corporate ethics 
ronald j caffrey vice president for marketing at johnsons 
controls said fragments of information often slip out and its 
not unethical to hear them 
vendor salespeople like to make you think that their product 
is being used by all kinds of important companies caffrey said 
its a fairly common thing to listen to vendors and just try to 
piece together intelligence 
but it would be unethical to devise a scheme to uncover 
information he said 
much information slips out because companies must walk a fine 
line between openness with customers and silence with competitors 
caffrey said 
customers want to know developments in technology so they dont 
have to worry about buying an obsolete product that requires 
public relations departments to be careful in releasing information 
protecting technology also can become a matter of national 
security for companies working on defense projects so the 
government requires clearance systems through which to filter 
information 
employees are given different levels of clearance on a 
needtoknow basis government officials conduct extensive 
background checks before granting higher levels of clearance 
they ask everybody you ever knew if youre a decent human 
said gregory a martin a doctoral candidate studying electrical 
engineering at the georgia institute of technology 
for commercial technology patents play a more important role in 
protection 
companies are very aggressive in getting patents and they do 
so early on said samuel r williamson a patent attorney for 
bell laboratories in new jersey to wait might mean that someone 
else files first 
minneapolisbased cray research inc has a less aggressive 
approach to protection and patenting said david frasch corporate 
secretary and technology counsel 
the supercomputer manufacturers attorneys work closely with its 
engineers to keep abreast of what needs to be protected and what 
needs to be shared with customers suppliers and other companies 
our philosophy is to identify whats meaningful and is 
important to protect and not bag every invention that comes

when a federal judge seized eastern airlines and 
appointed an outsider to run it he did something unusual in 
modernday bankruptcies but quite common before the law was 
overhauled 12 years ago 
the action by judge burton lifland this past week surprised many 
bankruptcy attorneys and led some to speculate that these outside 
managers known as trustees would be appointed in more bankruptcy 
reorganizations 
liflands order also amounted to a rebuke for easterns parent 
company texas air corp and its chairman frank lorenzo who have 
contended that they alone could salvage eastern from death 
the judge departed from a principle enshrined in a 1978 reform 
of the federal bankruptcy code known as debtorinpossession it 
takes for granted that the best managers for ailing companies are 
the existing managers 
the reform says only in rare circumstances such as substantial 
evidence of fraud or incompetence by management should trustees 
replace the people who supposedly know the most about the business 
theyre trying to save 
the presumption is that the debtor in possession will stay in 
place and manage the business said richard gitlin a hartford 
conn bankruptcy attorney and past president of the american 
bankruptcy institute i think the fact a trustee has been 
appointed in the eastern case is very significant 
by contrast in earlier bankruptcy law the presumption was that 
the companies got into trouble partly because management didnt 
know what it was doing and should be booted out 
prior to the reform a trustee was appointed in every big 
case said frank kennedy a retired university of michigan law 
professor and bankruptcy expert who played a major role in the 1978 
overhaul passed by congress 
part of the reason for the reform stemmed from the inability of 
many trustees to operate the failing businesses they were entrusted 
with salvaging under the old system many trustees often were 
political appointees who in many instances used their position for 
personal gain 
they would take a business not understand the steps to take 
in order to revitalize them have an agenda to generate business 
for themselves and many if not most of the businesses failed as a 
result said neal d colton a bankruptcy attorney with dechert 
price amp roads a philadelphia law firm 
in some respects thats the implication in liflands decision 
to take eastern away from lorenzo and texas and appoint veteran 
airline manager martin r shugrue to run it instead 
eastern has racked up enormous losses since a strike in march 
1989 that stemmed in large part from union hatred of lorenzo 
management eastern says the strike drove the carrier into chapter 
11 bankruptcy proceedings 
since then the management has hired replacement workers 
reorganized eastern into a smaller airline and repeatedly revised 
downward the amount of money it planned to repay unsecured 
creditors who are owed nearly 1 billion creditor willingness to 
trust management turned to impatience and exasperation evidence 
also surfaced that texas air had deliberately transferred eastern 
assets away to sister nonunion carrier continental airlines 
hurting easterns ability to survive this was one of the 
accusations made by the unions in their decision to strike 
lifland emphasized what he called managements inability to make 
reliable business forecasts as part of the basis for his decision 
he also said texas airs treatment of eastern suggested parental 
neglect 
kennedy said in the eastern case the court considered the 
balance of equities and decided that in light of the unseemly 
history of eastern its inability to deal with problems to the 
satisfaction of unsecured creditors it was time to get an 
independent trustee in there 
some bankruptcy trustee experts suggested lifland waited much 
too long to resolve what they called an intense unionmanagement 
conflict in the eastern case that was central to the airlines 
problems 
this was very apparent in the eastern bankruptcy deals that 
could have been worked were impossible said gary knostman 
president of the national association of bankruptcy trustees and a 
professional trustee himself 
a trustee isnt fighting the personalty battles and can 
normally get cooperation among groups much quicker he said 
im not criticizing lorenzos management but lets face it he 
was not a popular subject with the mechanics and pilots you get 
that bad blood its hard to make deals work 
in other business and economic news this past week 
former junk bond financier michael milken perhaps the 
bestknown figure of the 1980s era of easy money and wall street 
excess reached agreement with federal prosecutors to plead guilty 
in connection with securities fraud charges sources said milken 
who had insisted he was innocent for more than two years was 
expected to pay 600 million in fines and face a prison term 
a financial squeeze on banks appeared increasingly evident 
because of souring real estate and third world loans citicorp the 
nations largest bank reported a large loss and its creditrating 
faced review several other banks also reported losses or lower 
profits and federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said a 
majority of banks have tightened lending practices 
the trade deficit shrank in february to 649 billion the 
smallest gap in more than six years but the drop reported by the 
government was largely due to a decline in imports and private 
economists suggested it did not signal an increased foreign 
appetite for us goods considered crucial to longterm 
improvement in the us trade balance

the plea bargain agreement by indicted financier 
michael milken marks another stunning chapter in wall streets 
financial scandals which saw the fall of both the junk bond genius 
and the empire he created 
after a year of maintaining his innocence milken agreed friday 
to plead guilty to six felonies and pay 600 million in penalties 
to settle government charges in the largest individual securities 
fraud case in history 
the former head of drexel burnham lambert incs highyield bond 
department who parlayed the risky securities into a 
multibilliondollar business and two others had been named in a 
sweeping federal fraud and racketeering indictment stemming from 
the confessions of speculator ivan boesky 
boesky who cooperated with the government in settling charges 
that he ran a stock trading network based on illegal insider 
information fingered milken and drexel as key participants in his 
schemes 
milken repeatedly said he would be vindicated at trial but 
after lengthy negotiations between prosecutors and his attorneys 
he agreed to the plea bargain 
its a big victory to get a plea to six felonies said alan 
bromberg a securities law professor at southern methodist 
university who has followed the milken case closely its 
certainly one up for the government over wall street 
for both sides the deal also removes the risk and cost of the 
lengthy jury trial that was expected over the charges 
milken is expected to enter the guilty plea to the felony counts 
and agree to pay fines and restitution next week in us district 
court in manhattan said individuals close to the case who asked 
not to be named 
the sources cautioned that while a settlement had been reached 
it would not be final until the plea formally is entered 
milken his brother lowell and former drexel trader bruce 
newberg were indicted last year on 98 counts of fraud and 
racketeering related to insider trading and other alleged 
securities violations in a series of takeover deals from 1985 to 
1987 
none of the counts in the plea bargain relates to insider 
trading and there is no racketeering charge as part of the deal 
the government agreed to drop all charges against lowell milken 
the sources said 
assistant us attorney john k carroll declined to comment on 
the deal a spokesman for milken also declined to comment 
it was unclear whether the government would recommend a specific 
sentence to us district judge kimba wood milken would face a 
maximum of up to 30 years in prison on the six felony counts a 
single racketeering count would have carried a 20year sentence 
but the government could recommend that milken serve the counts 
concurrently for a maximum term of five years in prison 
it also was unclear whether milken would be forced to cooperate 
with any further government investigations 
the deal would settle separate civil charges brought by the 
securities and exchange commission in 1988 the sources said the 
600 million in penalties would be split between criminal fines and 
a fund for payment of any civil lawsuits related to milkens 
activities 
milken 43 is widely acknowledged as one of the most important 
financial figures of the 1980s 
milken is credited with reshaping corporate america by 
pioneering the widespread use of highyield bonds which offer high 
interest payments to compensate for the risky nature of the 
companies that issue them 
the socalled junk bonds were used to finance growth for 
hundreds of companies and fed a wave of hostile corporate takeovers 
in the 1980s 
milken was paid handsomely for his work receiving 1 billion 
from 198387 including 550 million in 1987 alone 
but drexel collapsed in february partly due to the longranging 
impact of its decision to plead guilty to six felonies and pay a 
record 650 million to settle its own case 
the milken settlement marks a complete change of course he had 
pleaded innocent to the original charges and had said he would take 
the case to trial 
since handing up the march 1989 indictment the government 
repeatedly delayed a promised superseding indictment 
the new charges were said to include allegations separate from 
information provided by boesky to strengthen the case boesky who 
pleaded guilty to a single felony count in november 1986 and paid a 
100 million fine was considered an easy target for defense 
lawyers 
drexels own plea bargain allowed it to avoid a racketeering 
indictment that could have put the firm out of business 
but the brokerage which grew from a secondtier player to a 
powerhouse on wall street largely because of milkens prowess 
never recovered from its plea deal and the sharp decline of the 
junk bond market beginning last fall it has been liquidating since 
filing for bankruptcy court protection in february 
drexel was forced to sever ties with milken under terms of its 
sec settlement milken resigned from drexel last june to set up his 
own consulting and investing firm

when michael milken pleaded innocent to 98 
counts of fraud and racketeering a y release sunday ear ago supporters 
donned caps 
reading mike milken we believe in you and cheered wildly as he 
exited manhattan federal court 
milken always has believed in himself so his decision to 
reverse course plead guilty to six felonies and pay 600 million 
in penalties was a stunning event 
the move reflected the governments power and the pressure of 
more than three years at the center of wall streets scandal 
there was no end in sight a friend of milkens said after 
the plea deal was revealed the physical and the emotional toll 
was just spectacular 
milken in many ways was the damocles of wall street creating 
and then ruling the junk bond market that drove the boom years of 
the 1980s bu the outcome leaves many issues 
unresolved milkens and many other wall street fraud cases relied 
on gray areas of the law plea bargains leave legal matters no 
clearer 
we never had a full development of the facts and we never had 
a court ruling that of these things were illegal bromberg said 
all we have is somebody saying i give up 
all that is very unsatisfying in wanting to know what really 
happened and what the law is on all these points he said 
milken the californiabred son of an accountant parlayed a 
novel idea about an obscure kind of debt into the gear that turned 
american finance in the 1980s his work made him the highest paid 
man in one year in american history 550 million in 1987 
milken has said he would rather be remembered for helping 
companies that needed financing unavailable from conventional 
sources such as commercial banks or the highgrade corporate debt 
market and for his extensive charitable activities 
but in all likelihood history will remember milken more for his 
legal travails that focused on allegations of widespread insider 
trading and other fraudulent activity 
milkens plea bargain does not include any counts related to 
insider trading and likely will not even involve any junkbond 
financed deals people familiar with the deal said it also would 
preclude any further investigations of milken associates 
milken helped create wall streets phenomenal growth in the last 
decade receiving a notoriety he never sought before becoming the 
target of the largest financial investigation in history 
born on the fourth of july in 1946 milken grew up in encino 
calif as a boy he helped his father prepare tax returns for 
clients 
milken graduated from the university of california at berkeley 
majoring in business administration and married his highschool 
sweetheart lori anne hackel he went on to the university of 
pennsylvanias wharton school 
as an undergraduate milken was influenced by a study published 
in the 1950s by an academician named w braddock hickman the study 
postulated that a diversified investment portfolio of highinterest 
bonds of risky companies with low credit ratings could be 
profitable because returns would amply make up for defaults 
milken applied the theory when he was hired fulltime by drexels 
bondtrading department in 1970 after working in its philadelphia 
office during business school 
a rapid success milken generated sizable profits for the firm 
through his highyield bond trading and drexel gradually gave him 
wide independence in 1978 the firm allowed milken to move the 
highyield bond department to beverly hills calif 
drexel used junk bonds to finance hundreds of small companies in 
the 1980s reaping hundreds of millions of dollars in fees milken 
controlled an empire of buyers and sellers of the securities issued 
by the wall street firm 
but junk bonds also were used by several flamboyant corporate 
raiders to mount hostile takeovers that drew fire from legislators 
and big business as a threat to corporate america milken was the 
lightning rod for that criticism 
after being linked in the press in late 1986 to boeskys illegal 
stock trading network milken and drexel became the main targets of 
the government innvestigators 
they were charged with civil fraud and other allegations by the 
securities and exchange commission in 1988 drexel that winter 
agreed to plead guilty to six felonies and pay 650 million in 
penalties 
milken was indicted the following march along with his brother 
and former drexel trader bruce newberg he resigned from drexel in 
june and set up a consulting and investing firm that advises 
companies but does not issue securities 
while milken maintained his innocence he indicated in an 
interview last fall that he just wanted the ordeal to end 
if you spent your whole life trying to build things some of 
these things sap your energy and you feel frustrated he said
