democrat michael dukakis spent friday at his wifes side as she 
recovered from a delicate spinal operation republican george bush 
welcomed president reagan home from the superpower summit in 
moscow saying you made us proud 
going into the final weekend of the 1988 presidential primary 
season only jesse jackson was formally campaigning calling for an 
end to discrimination against aids victims and greater attention to 
environmental issues 
we cannot wait to lead our nation away from discrimination and 
fearmongering all leaders must speak out now jackson said in a 
statement in los angeles the president must take every available 
step including an executive order to stop discrimination now 
dukakis is favored to best jackson in tuesdays balloting in 
california montana new jersey and new mexico and seal his hold on 
the democratic presidential nomination 
the massachusetts governor continued to pick up backing from 
delegates formerly uncommitted or pledged to candidates who now 
have dropped out with more than 20 switching to his column friday 
he was less than 300 delegates short of the 2081 he needs to win 
the nomination in atlanta in july tuesdays primaries have 466 
democratic delegates at stake 
dukakis canceled his campaign schedule thursday to return to 
boston after doctors urged immediate surgery for his wife kitty he 
spent the night at massachusetts general hospital and then worked 
at the hospital awaiting the end of the operation 
after five hours of surgery to correct a neck problem that 
doctors feared could lead to paralysis the prognosis was positive 
the operation went very well said dr lawrence borges 
there were no problems at all 
doctors removed two herniated discs from her neck and replaced 
them with bone taken from her hip she had been experiencing pain 
and numbness for several weeks and doctors determined both problems 
were caused by dangerous pressure on her spine caused by the discs 
i talked to kitty in the recovery room and she said she wanted 
an ice cream and a massage dukakis said following the surgery 
im prepared to provide both 
dukakis said he would resume campaigning in new jersey over the 
weekend if mrs dukakis condition remained good and head to 
california for a final campaign swing on sunday 
bush the gopnomineetobe returned to washington from a week 
of meetings at his kennebunkport maine summer home to be part of 
the entourage welcoming president reagan back from moscow 
this week an american president strode the hard ground of red 
square and reminded the world through the sureness of his step and 
the lilting of his words what a moving and bracing thing 
freedom is bush said in the ceremonies at andrews air force 
base the fact is you made us proud 
on behalf of the people of the united states of america 
welcome home and well done he said 
before welcoming reagan bush flew by helicopter to walter reed 
army medical center to visit salvadoran president jose napoleon 
duarte who is suffering from stomach and liver cancer 
i plan to wish him well and share our countrys appreciation 
for all hes done for democracy bush said before the halfhour 
visit 
jackson who was campaigning friday in california montana and 
new mexico told a gathering in sante fe nm that the issue of 
nuclear waste storage and toxic dumps is no longer a fringe 
issue 
environmental protection is central to our existence it 
goes to the heart of the american dream i stand to protect that 
dream 
in montana jackson spoke at a dinner sponsored by the state 
democratic party in butte where he was warmly received by the few 
hundred in attendance most of whom wore dukakis buttons 
he offered a prayer for mrs dukakis noting that the 
massachusetts governor was home by his wifes side jackson joked 
that he has done such a good job in massachusetts im trying to 
keep him there four more years 
with the primaries almost over dukakis began to muse a bit 
about the process of picking a running mate 
in an interview aboard his campaign plane heading back to boston 
thursday evening he said 1984 democratic nominee walter mondale 
advised against following his example of a public series of 
interviews with possible running mates dukakis said he was taking 
that advice to heart 
i doubt very much i will do that he said 
but asked what kind of process he intended to go through in 
choosing a vice presidential running mate dukakis said i dont 
know i really dont know 
the massachusetts governor leads bush in polls both nationally 
and in many states 
frankly i think one of the reasons that hes in trouble is 
because its been largely a negative campaign now for four weeks 
and i dont think thats what people are looking for dukakis

a woman who runs an upholstery shop says she 
scrounged up a posse of friends and relatives to help police nab a 
man suspected of burglarizing the family business 
angelina diggs of pittsburgh recruited friends neighbors and 
cousins we hadnt seen in years to canvass several 
neighborhoods hoping to find fences or dealers in stolen goods 
we stayed up day and night stopping people on the sidewalks 
and asking a boatload of questions she said 
a tip led to an address where a man showed mrs diggs the love 
seat and sofa worth 2500 that were stolen saturday 
she returned and posing as a buyer paid 250 in marked money 
detectives sprang from a hiding place when they saw the man carry 
the furniture to her car 
police said they charged carl brevard 24 of pittsburgh with 
receiving stolen property

a continental airlines dc10 pilot aborted 
his takeoff at 115 mph when he concluded there was insufficient 
clearance between his plane and a delta air lines jet that had 
landed in front of him officials said 
four of the jets tires deflated due to overheating but no one 
aboard the flight scheduled from los angeles international airport 
to honolulu on thursday was injured 
the continental jet had reached a speed of about 115 mph but 
never left the ground authorities said it carried 148 passengers 
and about 15 crew members said airline spokesman ned walker in 
houston 
the tower had cleared the captain for takeoff walker said 
the captain began takeoff roll down the runway when he observed 
another jet aircraft at the end of the runway that he felt had not 
cleared the runway adequately and as a precautionary move aborted 
the takeoff 
faa spokeswoman elly brekke said the continental pilot had made 
a prudent decision based on his perception but the jet ahead 
of him was already off the runway 
a delta aircraft had landed ahead of the continental aircraft 
and had cleared the runway but apparently stopped on the taxiway 
ms brekke said 
passengers got off the continental jet onto a taxiway but did 
not use emergency exits officials said 
four of the dc10s tires lost air because they have 
heatsensitive safety plugs that allow the tires to deflate at a 
certain temperature to prevent blowouts ms brekke and walker said

president lee tenghui said today that 
taiwan will not reimpose martial law despite bloody rioting last 
month and almost daily demonstrations for more democracy 
the masscirculation china times quoted the president as saying 
taiwans strong military will never interfere with politics 
lees remarks were made thursday to a group of ethnic chinese 
professors from australia hong kong japan and the united states 
visiting taiwan for a seminar on the islands political and 
economic liberalization 
the political liberalization which included ending 38 years of 
martial law last july has led to hundreds of demonstrations last 
month a protest by farmers turned into a bloody battle between riot 
police and demonstrators that reportedly left more than 200 people 
injured 
a group of 75 conservative nationalist legislators called for a 
return to martial law in response to the rioting 
to again declare martial law will be out of the question 
lee was quoted as saying 
lee also appeared anxious to scotch newspaper reports that the 
government has had little control over the military since the death 
in january of longtime leader president chiang chingkuo who was 
the main architect of taiwans recent liberalization trend 
in some countries soldiers chased the president away with 
their carbines but this will never occur here lee was quoted as 
saying

will the best musical be a big british 
blockbuster based on a variation of beauty and the beast or a 
dark fairy tale where happily ever after never comes 
will the best play be a savage comedy about two movie moguls in 
the making or a haunting tale about the children of slaves coming 
to terms with the past or a bizarre love story involving a french 
diplomat and a chinese opera singer of indeterminate sex 
the competition for the 1988 tony awards reflects the fact that 
artistically this was broadways best season in several years and 
more importantly for the new york theater industry all the shows 
nominated for best play and best musical are still running 
the awards show to be televised sunday june 5 at 9 pm edt on 
cbs should be a giant advertisement for broadway 
there are a number of strong candidates in almost every 
category particularly musical with the phantom of the opera 
into the woods and a revival of cole porters anything goes 
each getting 10 nominations 
the battle between the phantom of the opera the english 
extravaganza by andrew lloyd webber and into the woods an 
american challenger written by stephen sondheim and james lapine 
holds the most interest 
the best play competition is also spirited the nominees are 
m butterfly by david henry hwang speedtheplow by david 
mamet joe turners come and gone by august wilson and a walk 
in the woods by lee blessing 
more than any other theater award the tony has always helped a 
show where it counts at the box office joe turner and a 
walk in the woods are doing marginal business and will need the 
prize to survive the summer only speedtheplow has done 
exceptional business and much of that has been because of one of 
its costars pop singer madonna 
into the woods already has picked up best musical awards 
from the new york drama critics circle and the drama desk two 
other theater organizations but dont count phantom out it is 
the biggest success of the season at least in financial terms and 
tony voters usually go for the money the other shows up for best 
musical are sarafina a south african musical and romance 
romance a small evening of two oneact musicals 
if any award would appear to be a shooin the prize for best 
actor in a musical would seem to be locked up by michael crawford 
who plays the title role in the phantom of the opera even 
critics who panned the musical had high praise for crawfords 
portrayal of the deformed composer who lurks in the shadows of the 
paris opera house his competitors include scott bakula romance 
romance david carroll of chess and howard mcgillin 
anything goes 
patti lupone mcgillins costar in anything goes is the 
favorite for the best actress in a musical award her biggest 
competition is joanna gleason who plays the bakers wife in into 
the woods the other nominees are alison fraser of romance 
romance and judy kuhn of chess 
the best actor category is the most competitive in several 
seasons the category was so crowded that several promising 
candidates didnt even get nominated including john malkovich who 
gave a bravura performance in lanford wilsons burn this 
the choices are ron silver one of those wouldbe film producers 
in speedtheplow john lithgow the bewildered diplomat in 
m butterfly derek jacobi a tortured mathematical genius in 
breaking the code and robert prosky a soviet arms negotiator 
in a walk in the woods 
there werent many good roles for women on broadway this season 
joan allen should win the best actress award for her portrait of a 
ballet dancer in burn this others nominated are glenda 
jackson macbeth blythe danner a streetcar named desire 
and frances mcdormand a streetcar named desire 
joe turners come and gone dominates the featured actress

british satire serious money the winner is a tossup 
bd wong as the exotic opera singer in m butterfly is the 
favorite to take the featured actor award he goes against michael 
gough breaking the code lou liberatore burn this and 
delroy lindo joe turners come and gone 
phantom is expected to dominate the technical awards for 
sets costumes and lighting if it does maria bjornson could walk

just two weeks after the fbi charged 28 health 
inspectors with extortion for threatening to add restaurants to the 
citys notorious rat list several restaurateurs showed two can 
play that game by trying to bribe their way off the list 
about onethird of the citys health inspectors were indicted 
the fbi and the citys department of investigations found at least 
300 of the citys 15000 or so restaurants were solicited for 
bribes just during its investigation 
some restaurant owners dreaded to see them coming driving up 
in cadillacs and wearing rolex watches said james m fox head 
of the federal bureau of investigation in the city 
the health department was still stinging from the scandal when 
some restaurateurs assumed the cozy handinpocket relationship had 
been only briefly suspended 
two weeks after all the notoriety about the inspection 
scandals six of our inspectors reported that restaurant managers 
and owners tried to bribe them said marvin bogner the citys 
assistant health commissioner 
noting that inspectors usually take off their suit coats and don 
blue work jackets for inspections bogner said one inspector 
noticed the restaurateur putting a wad of bills in his coat pocket 
the inspector took the wad of bills and threw it on the 
kitchen floor 
the bribe attempts offered in late april involved a wide 
spectrum of restaurants ranging from beaneries to bistros said 
bogner he would not name any because the department of 
investigations is looking into the reports 
the most obvious public effect of the crackdown by the fbi and 
the city has been that newspapers stopped publishing the city 
health departments rat list officially and more politely called 
the list of food inspection results 
the newspapers said they could not be sure if a restaurant had a 
legitimate sanitation problem or if the owner had merely resisted 
extortion by health inspectors 
new york gourmets and gourmands had scanned the new york times 
newsday and the daily news weekly with mingled horror and 
fascination fearing that their favorite eatery would be listed 
after they enjoyed a meal there 
a few typical examples 
a restaurant that among other violations had mouse 
droppings flies and an employee smoking while serving 
a bakery cited for having nailpolish remover motorcycle 
oil peroxide paints cough medicines and insecticides on shelves 
near food 
greenwich streets pussycat lounge for of course cats 
kept on premises perhaps it is not a coincidence that the 
restaurants cited for having cats had no rodent droppings and vice 
versa 
a few power lunch spots where the citys movers and 
shakers talk big business have also received violation notices 
in 1982 mimi sheraton then the times restaurant reviewer 
raved about the satiny vinaigrette dressing and bracing 
golden consomme at la cote basque giving it a threestar rating 
the health department panned la cote basque in 1984 citing its 
slimeladen ice cream machine and greasy floor at the 
time the prix fixe luncheon cost 25 
the rat list wasnt always so specific until last autumn it 
just named offending restaurants without citing whether they had 
cats rats or were simply missing necessary operating permits 
a new york times spokeswoman said editors decided to change the 
format of the weekly list to help readers distinguish between major 
and minor health violations 
the satirical monthly magazine spy beat all the dailies by a 
year by providing the real dirt on the citys restaurants beginning 
in october 1986 said joe mastriani the editor in charge of the 
column 
it was a pretty popular feature he added but spy 
dropped it last fall when the newspapers began running the new 
comprehensive rat list 
the new fulldisclosure policy ended in late march when the fbi 
charged that the 28 current and former health department inspectors 
had doubled and tripled their annual salaries of 25000 to 30000 
through extortion

sheila shea was just trying for a last 
laugh but some officials say the cemetery thats the final resting 
place of louisa may alcott is no place for a tombstone that reads 
who the hell is sheila shea 
shea who died a year and a half ago at age 43 is buried in the 
historic sleepy hollow cemetery in whose authors row are 
buried alcott and 19thcentury luminaries ralph waldo emerson and 
henry david thoreau 
the disagreement over the 3foot gray granite headstone 
recently surfaced at the concord cemetery committee which labeled 
the inscription obscene some members of the committee an 
advisory body to the towns department of public works pushed for 
legal action to have the headstone removed 
the cemetery really isnt a place to make a statement it is a 
place of memorial committee president mary elizabeth baker said 
sleepy hollow is a notable cemetery because of the people who are 
buried there it has a national reputation we would hate to see it 
become a sideshow 
officials decided that the town could not afford a legal battle 
and that it would be fighting from shaky legal ground said tony 
logalbo town finance director but they have changed the rules to 
guard against similar headstones at the widely visited cemetery 
its a tourist site people who are visiting the town of 
concord go to find the grave sites of wellknown individuals from 
history logalbo said thursday some people in the town felt 
that the sentiments it expresses were not in keeping with the 
spirit of the site 
town officials were divided over whether the word hell is 
obscene 
concord an affluent town 19 miles northwest of boston was 
founded by the puritans in 1635 it was the site of the second 
revolutionary war clash the home of several wellknown early 
american authors and site of thoreaus celebrated walden pond 
shea who is remembered by her friends as a warm funloving 
person died in november 1986 of cancer she had worked in the 
accounting department of a cambridge company and had arranged and 
paid for her friends to have dinner after her funeral 
she was divorced and left a teenage son and daughter 
norma wentworth a nurse who helped administer her chemotherapy 
treatments said she imagined shea would be laughing at the 
brouhaha over her headstone 
she just had a very good sense of humor wentworth said 
she did not intend to be malicious 
as a result of the debate over the headstone anyone who wishes 
to buy a plot at sleepy hollow in the future will be informed of 
restrictions against improper or offensive headstones 
according to a recent measure approved by the town board of 
selectmen 
the measure would allow the cemetery committee to remove future 
headstones but the list of restrictions does not include any 
specific words or phrases 
nancy griffin the executor of sheas will had contacted the 
american civil liberties union and vowed to fight any attempt to 
remove her friends headstone 
no matter what sheilas reasons were a person has a right to 
freedom of speech dead or alive griffin said

more than 30 million elderly americans from the financial ravages 
of serious illness is one short step away from final congressional 
approval

awful lot of fear from the minds of over 30 million seniors rep 
pete stark dcalif said after the house voted 32872 thursday to 
approve a catastrophic health insurance bill 
the measure goes to the senate where similarly overwhelming 
approval is assured probably next week it represents the biggest 
expansion of medicare in the programs 23year history 
originally proposed by president reagan more than a year ago 
albeit in a less expansive version the legislation is intended to 
protect the nations 32 million medicare beneficiaries from 
financial ruin stemming from illnesses that run up big hospital and 
doctor bills 
the legislation will go a long way to alleviate the fears that 
elderly people have about being wiped out from financial costs when 
catastrophic illness hits said rep henry waxman dcalif who 
with stark was a major mover in the project 
waxman acknowledged that the measure does not address the 
problem of nursing home and other longterm costs for people not 
sick enough to be hospitalized but unable to live alone 
that has to be no 1 on our agenda for the next breakthrough 
in the health area said waxman 
although the final housesenate version was considerably 
enriched along the way mainly by the addition of an outpatient 
prescription drug benefit health and human services secretary 
otis r bowen has said he will ask president reagan to sign the 
measure which house speaker jim wright has called the most 
important health initiative in recent years 
the bill provides full hospital coverage after a onceayear 
deductible estimated at 564 in 1989 and indexed to hospital 
inflation medicare now pays full charges for no more than 59 days 
a year and the recipient is subject to a deductible for each 
hospitalization 
the cap on costs for physicians is 1370 a year after a 75 
deductible medicare now pays 80 percent of approved doctor bills 
and that part of the program remains intact starting in 1989 
however the 75 deductible and the 20 percent share paid by 
beneficiaries count toward the 1370 cap after that is reached 
medicare pays 100 percent of approved doctor bills 
however the beneficiary will remain liable for any portion of 
doctor bills that exceed the fees approved by medicare 
in a new benefit medicare will pay half of outpatient 
prescription drug costs in 1991 after a 600 deductible is met the 
government share rises to 60 percent in 1992 and 80 percent in 
1993 however the deductible is expected to rise each year to keep 
pace with rising drug costs 
medicare now does not cover outpatient drugs except for a 
handful of very expensive ones such as antirejection medication 
for organ transplant recipients 
all the additional benefits are to be paid for by additional 
charges to medicare enrollees a combination of flat monthly 
premium increases deducted from social security checks and an 
additional slidingscale supplemental premium that will be charged 
to the estimated 40 percent of the elderly with enough income to 
make them subject to federal income taxes 
the additional flat premium starts at 4 a month in 1989 
climbing to 1020 in 1993 
the socalled supplemental premium in essence an income tax 
surcharge starts at 2250 a year for each 150 of income tax 
owed in 1989 climbing to an additional 42 a year on each 150 of 
tax liability by 1993 there is an 800 cap on the supplemental 
premium in 1989 climbing to 1050 in 1993

notification programs 
quarantine or isolation of hivinfected individuals based only 
on hiv status without consideration of an individuals behavior is 
not appropriate and should not be adopted by any state

the day president reagan left the 
soviet union yuri osipov also took a trip the railway worker rode 
the 715 am train to moscow to get a sofa because he said there 
was nothing worth buying in yaroslavl 
in state food stores another day began with no meat on sale 
in yaroslavls center the pipes that supply hot water to 
apartment houses and shops had been turned off for days reportedly 
so the mains could be repaired foreign tourists at the hotel 
yaroslavl took icy showers or none at all 
a food store in the dzerzhinsky neighborhood had only one fresh 
vegetable for sale cucumbers at 130 a pound when a downtown 
kiosk on freedom street began selling vanilla ice cream a line of 
hundreds of people formed within 10 minutes 
we have nothing here no meat not even sausage said 
alexander dusman a violinist with the citys symphony orchestra 
during the summit meeting between reagan and soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev some moscow stores sold danish hams and other 
delicacies that are usually unavailable and thousands of workers 
were dragooned into performing a crash urban facelift 
that was the stage but yaroslavl lay far behind the scenes in 
this ancient russian city 160 miles northeast of the soviet 
capital gorbachevs campaign for more consumer abundance has borne 
meager fruit to date 
in the past three years there have been no changes in the way 
people live said a government worker in this city of 600000 
people situated on the upper reaches of the volga river the only 
real accomplishments i see are in foreign policy and the way the 
soviet union is perceived abroad 
when celebrated poet yevgeny yevtushenko in a recent article 
wanted to name a city where the food situation was a nightmare he 
picked yaroslavl 
local librarian a malygina wrote in a leter published in the 
pravda newspaper friday that she was ashamed to hear what soviets 
from other cities call her hometown yaroslavl the suffering 
or the hungry 
the scanty variety of food is so critical that every friday 
buses with license plates marked ya for yaroslavl arrive in 
northern moscow where passengers fan out to state food stores to 
load up on sausage butter macaroni and other foodstuffs 
founded around the year 1010 yaroslavl may not be typical of 
cities in the countrys richer agricultural regions but it 
graphically shows how much of the soviet union has problems feeding 
itself and assuring a better life for its residents 
osipov a broadshouldered mustachioed siberian who moved to 
yaroslavl for its milder climate has been waiting for two years to 
buy a car but supplies are insufficient 
he has had his name for four years on a waiting list to obtain a 
bigger apartment for himself his wife and two children but has no 
notion of when he may get one 
only 5 percent of the yaroslavl regions active population works 
in agriculture the fickle climate wipes out at least one harvest 
every three years according to agricultural editors on the local 
newspaper severny rabochy northern worker 
our region was in a disastrous state last year because of a 
cold winter and wet short summer the local communist party 
chief igor a tolstoukhov said in an interview we 
unquestionably need to produce more meat more milk 
the 49yearold party boss is the top authority in a region with 
14 million people that covers an area the size of the netherlands 
he said he thought yevtushenko had exaggerated 
our people have a healthy balanced diet he said 
the lack of locally grown vegetables lures enterprising farmers 
to yaroslavl from as far away as the southern republic of georgia 
and the city of grozny near the caspian sea 
they fly northward with boxes of tomatoes to sell in stalls at 
yaroslavls open air market the price 450 a pound women from 
the western ukraine sell baked sunflower and pumpkin seeds 
yaroslavl which is studded with ancient oniondomed churches 
is an important industrial center that produces tires 
petrochemicals and diesel engines 
leonid a chesnokov editor in chief of severny rabochy said 
complaints had been mounting recently about the quality of the 
diesel engines produced in december workers at the plant staged a 
demonstration to protest black saturdays days where they were 
called in to work to make up for lags in output 
chesnokov said the paper receives about 30000 letters a year 
from readers who want to see major economic problems solved and 
greater efficiency and productivity in the workplace 
however the newspaper itself showed some of the problems that 
the local press is having in adapting to the new conditions of 
gorbachevs glasnost campaign 
on tuesday severny rabochy printed on its front page a 
twodayold tass dispatch sbout reagans arrival in moscow on 
sunday another page one story announced the ratification of the

available to all students at the school during the serving 
period said catherine bajalia food services director for the

the european nato allies have widely 
praised both the us and soviet leaders for using the moscow 
summit to forge a new stability in eastwest relations 
respect growing trust and affection are there between 
president reagan and kremlin chief mikhail s gorbachev after four 
days of meetings said lord carrington the nato secretary general 
this personal bond we all hope augurs well for further 
reductions of tension in the international atmosphere he said in 
a speech thursday to the royal institute of international relations 
in brussels 
things are moving in a good direction said french president 
francois mitterrand speaking in evian france after a meeting 
with west german chancellor helmut kohl who also praised the 
summit outcome 
hansdietrich genscher the west german foreign minister said 
the importance of the moscow meeting the fourth for reagan and 
gorbachev in 30 months went beyond the arms issues it dealt with 
through this summit the americansoviet relationship got a new 
stability a new perspective genscher said in brussels after he 
and other alliance officials met with secretary of state george p 
shultz at nato headquarters to hear details of the moscow talks 
shultz gave an upbeat assessment of the summit and told 
reporters afterward that the superpowers had come a long way in 
their relationship since reagan first met gorbachev in geneva in 
november 1985 
it is an undeniable and observable fact that the relationship 
now is far better than it was at the time of the first summit he 
said 
the moscow summit produced no major arms agreements although two 
secondary accords were signed including one requiring at least 24 
hours advance notification before ballistic missile tests 
the european allies are eager for washington and moscow to 
conclude an agreement cutting their longrange nuclear missiles by 
up to 50 percent but they showed no outward sign of disappointment 
that shultz reported only modest progress in this area 
hans van den broek the dutch foreign minister said the summit 
had provided a great measure of continuity and consistency in 
eastwest relations this he said made it possible for the 
superpowers to work gradually toward more disarmament 
this is not a process of quick fixes but at least there is a 
process he said 
european officials who heard shultzs report on the moscow 
meetings said afterward they were not discouraged by the apparently 
slim chances completing a new arms reduction agreement before 
reagan leaves office next january 
the firm will expressed in moscow by both sides on arms 
control is an essential condition for decisive progress in 
geneva giulio andreotti the italian foreign minister told 
reporters 
carrington stressed that gorbachev deserves much of the credit 
for recent improvements in ussoviet relations particularly for 
the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty that the us and 
soviet leaders put into force on wednesday the treaty is the first 
to eliminate an entire class of nuclear weapons 
i dont think it would have happened without him carrington 
said in an interview with the associated press at his nato office 
he added that reagan and the nato alliance did their part by 
sticking to a twintrack strategy of deploying us cruise and 
pershing ii nuclear missiles in europe while also seeking to 
negotiate cuts 
carrington also indicated that he saw little chance of reagan 
and gorbachev holding a fifth summit since both sides have planed 
down the odds of completing agreement soon in the strategic arms 
reduction talks 
there would only be a fifth summit if it was possible there 
were going to be a start agreement he said i would have 
thought it doubtful there would be one otherwise 
genscher said that despite the long odds of a start deal being 
completed this year the moscow summit offered new hope in all 
areas of arms control 
it seems important to us that both sides want to use the next 
months to come to agreements he said

a canadiansoviet ski expedition across the 
arctic ice cap battled high winds rough terrain and frostbite to 
complete a 1200mile trek from siberia to the northern edge of 
canada 
we spent twothirds of the time skiing and onethird 
clambering over ice and boulders we constantly had to cross open 
water because of cracks in the ice max buxton said thursday 
after the 13man team returned to ottawa to a heros welcome 
at times people came pretty close to tumbling in said the 
32yearold family doctor from ontario who read about the 
sovietproposed expedition in a magazine and volunteered 
ice ridges in the arctic reached 100 feet high he said and 
swirling snowstorms with winds up to 44 miles per hour slowed the 
trek 
canadian energy minister marcel masse and soviet ambassador 
alexei rodionov joined about 200 friends family flagwaving 
schoolchildren and a police band who greeted the parkaclad team at 
ottawa airport on thursday 
it took the four canadians and nine soviets 91 days to ski about 
1075 miles from the northernmost tip of the soviet union to 
ellesmere island in the canadian arctic where they left the 
shifting ice pack on wednesday 
they became the first explorers to make a polar crossing from 
the soviet union to canada and they did it entirely by skiing and 
climbing over snow and ice without dogsleds or vehicles 
im enjoying the warmth said buxton who lost the tip of 
one toe to frostbite and suffered from exposure but emerged 
otherwise unscathed 
every night i would take off my shoes and look at my mangled 
feet and say god i cant go on he said 
buxton says the low point came on the first half of the trek 
from siberia to the north pole when temperatures dropped to 48 
below zero 
i froze my toes i had some bad heel blisters and a whole pile 
of things wrong i thought if anybodys not going to make it i 
might be the guy he said 
considering that 13 men traveled almost 2000 kilometers 
1200 miles as the crow flies and many more thousand kilometers 
miles twisting and turning we came off pretty scottfree he 
said citing assorted infections pulled muscles tendonitis frost 
and sun damage but no serious injuries 
hardships were many we only had a sponge bath every 16 
days buxton said their highfat diet for energy included bacon 
russian sausage peanut butter and the indian dish pemmican which 
consists of dried meat and fat 
everybody experienced a real high at coming in sight of land 
on the northern coast of ellesmere said buxton who said he 
became so lonely that he proposed to his girlfriend by shortwave 
radio message from the high arctic i was missing her pretty 
badly 
dental hygienist nancy burton said yes and was waiting for him 
when he got home 
the canadians spoke little russian and vice versa 
there was a language barrier at first buxton said the 
cold made it very difficult to come out of your thick insulated 
shell to communicate we didnt become open and start to talk about 
our problems and feelings until the second half of the trip 
but theres an old eskimo proverb that if you spend three 
months with a man on the ice you will come away knowing his 
language i think we learned to communicate and got around a lot of 
the suspicions he said 
the official leader of the expedition moscow mathematician 
dmitri shparo told an ottawa news conference he expects the men 
will remain fast friends 
the canadians are very strong very beautiful very 
intelligent shparo said they will be my good friends a very 
long time into the future 
the expedition began from the northern tip of the severnaya 
zemlya archipelago in siberia on march 3 and reached the pole on 
april 26 
ambassador rodionov said the trek showed that even in extreme 
conditions people are able to overcome cultural barriers 
the team will undergo four days of medical tests in ottawa 
before going their separate ways like the canadians were 
homesick too said shparo

a lawyer for the wife of singer james brown 
says he plans to withdraw a motion asking for diplomatic immunity 
for his client because her husband was once praised as the no 1 
ambassador 
attorney allen w johnson had asked a richmond county state 
court judge to dismiss misdemeanor traffic charges on grounds that 
adrienne brown has diplomatic immunity 
mrs brown 38 was charged with driving under the influence of 
drugs speeding and criminal trespass sept 3 1987 she pleaded 
innocent and the case is expected to go to trial later this month 
johnsons motion made tuesday was based on a statement made by 
us rep douglas barnard dga two years ago on james brown 
appreciation day in augusta which lies close to browns home on 
beech island sc james is indeed our no 1 ambassador 
barnard said 
johnsons motion said brown is americas no 1 ambassador and 
as such should have diplomatic immunity and such immunity extends 
to his wife the accused herein 
johnson said thursday he would withdraw the motion adding that 
he filed it only because every possible defense had to be explored 
he said he has since determined that the congressman intended his 
comments as a goodwill gesture and a figure of speech 
diplomatic immunity shields officials of foreign nations from 
criminal charges while they represent their countries in the united 
states 
the browns have recently had several highly publicized fights 
and brown has said he plans to file for divorce

serious differences remain 
here are the unresolved issues 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it was once hoped that the summit would be crowned by an 
agreement to slash longrange nuclear weapons 30 to 50 percent but 
the leaders made only modest progress on a strategic arms reduction 
treaty on mobile missiles the two sides agreed to restrict them 
to designated territories so they could be counted more easily but 
the dimensions of the areas were not set the superpowers did not 
resolve two other problems monitoring cruise missiles aboard 
warships and whether the us antimissile research program can be 
squared with the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
both leaders said it was still possible to reach agreement on a

little real prospect for a breakthrough

the house banking committee has added its 
support to legislation that would cut virtually all economic ties 
with the apartheid government of south africa 
the democraticcontrolled panel on thursday endorsed the bill by 
a 3414 vote largely along party lines the measure would escalate 
the economic pressure imposed two years ago when congress passed a 
limited sanctions law over president reagans veto 
a similar bill had been approved may 3 by the house foreign 
affairs committee and the legislation still must be considered by 
several other house panels before being sent to the full house for 
a vote 
the bill would force a virtual cutoff of us economic ties to 
south africa forcing divestiture of us investments within a year 
and prohibiting most exports and imports it also would tighten 
restrictions on us lending to south african companies and would 
ban us military and intelligence cooperation with pretoria 
approval came after the panel narrowly adopted 2724 an 
amendment offered by an opponent of the legislation rep bill 
mccollum rfla that would have the effect of making it even 
tougher but at the same time more difficult for congress to pass 
the amendment would have extended south african import 
prohibitions to include not only products from that country but 
products from other countries which contain components or parts 
made in south africa the provision would affect many items 
containing industrial diamonds among other products 
mccollum argued that the move would prevent other countries from 
stepping in to snap up the share of trade given up by the united 
states but opponents said the provision would be impossible to 
enforce because of the difficulty of tracing the origin of items 
like diamonds 
this is an effort to kill the bill with pseudokindness 
said rep barney frank dmass 
in 1986 the latest year for which figures were available us 
direct and indirect investment in south africa totaled an estimated 
4 billion total bilateral trade for that year was roughly 2 
billion a recent congressional report noted that since 1984 156 
us companies have withdrawn from south africa and another 157 
still have direct investments or employees there 
the reagan administration is strongly opposed to the 
legislation preferring instead a policy of constructive 
engagement that policy calls for maintaining political and 
economic ties to south africa in the belief that such ties give the 
united states more leverage to promote reforms in south africas 
system of racial separatism 
several members of the banking committee expressed concern that 
us banks would suffer from the increased lending restrictions 
which would ban rescheduling of outstanding loans 
chairman fernand st germain dri noted that there had been a 
flurry of lobbying against the measure by banking interests who 
argued they would be forced to sell off south african loans at 
discounts 
a primary sponsor of the sanctions bill foreign affairs africa 
subcommittee chairman howard wolpe dmich acknowledged there 
would be some costs for a limited number of us interests and 
said some south africans could realize shortterm benefits 
i wish there were a way to add pressure without cost or 
inconvenience to american business wolpe said but there is no 
way to do that he said it is in the longterm best interests of 
the united states to avoid what he termed an evolving war 
between the races in south africa

the 13yearold from fair oaks calif outlasted runnerup 
victor c wang of camarillo calif in a grueling 45minute 
oneonone finale thursday 
her winning word in the 61st annual contest sponsored by 
scripps howard newspapers was elegiacal an adjective used to 
describe the couplets or pairs of lines in some poems 
as the judges nodded their heads that she had won and the

science the eighthgrader said later 
rageshree who was born in india and whose parents are both 
statistics professors said she had studied spelling for at least 
two hours daily since january helped by her mother father and 
younger sister 
victor a 14yearold from camarillo calif stumbled when he 
misspelled stertorous replacing the first o with a u 
the word is an adjective used to describe harsh snoring sounds 
for a while neither child had much luck as they were asked to 
spell a series of words that both proved unable to pin down after 
victor misspelled balmacaan a loose overcoat and a bee 
official spelled it correctly the eighthgrader drew laughter from 
an equally perplexed audience by asking who makes up these 
words 
rageshree won 1500 and several other prizes while victor 
garnered 1000 
it took 935 words to find a winner from the record field of 200 
hopefuls after wednesdays first day of competition 144 of them 
remained 
the competitors began falling faster thursday as the words were 
drawn less frequently from study lists that had been distributed 
and more often from websters third new international dictionary 
the contests bible

the us postal service is turning to 
businessman h ross perot for help in finding ways to improve 
efficiency and save money 
postmaster general anthony frank announced on thursday that 
perot has accepted a 500000 noprofit contract to analyze 
five areas of postal operations and recommend improvements 
the dallas computer systems billionaire announced formation of a 
washingtonbased company perot systems corp to take on the 
contract 
the deal calls for perots company to identify potential savings 
in transportation telecommunications delivery revenue protection 
and transportation equipment 
the postal service is pretty darn good but i want to be 
better than that said frank who has been in office 91 days 
after the notforprofit period expires the company will be 
eligible for a share of any savings that result from the studies 
i hope its a lot said frank 
perot said eight top managers at his former company electronic 
data systems resigned friday to join his new venture that was the 
first date on which perot was permitted to hire eds workers under 
an agreement reached in 1986 when general motors bought out his 
interest in the company 
that settlement also prohibited perot from launching a new 
forprofit business that would compete with eds prior to 1989 
hence the noprofit postal contract 
the studies will not focus on changes in labor contracts frank 
said although he said union leaders will be involved in 
discussions with perot some 80 percent of postal costs are 
laborrelated 
frank said he wants to find 10 to 20 areas in which the agency 
can save 100 million or more apiece annually 
the postal service spent 325 billion last year with a loss of 
223 million a rate increase that took effect april 3 is aimed at 
pulling the agency back into the black but costs continue rising 
as volume grows 
frank said he would like to spread out the time between postage 
rate increases which have been occurring about every three years 
my goal is one more increase between now and the end of the 
century he said at a news conference 
let the record show that knowledgeable people in the room 
laughed he added quickly but you have to have goals 
right now he later admitted it looks as if were going 
to have to push ourselves just to keep to the threeyear cycle 
asked if the perot deal had been opened to bids frank said it 
was not 
its probably safe to assume there arent a lot of firms 
around the beltway lusting after noprofit contracts he said 
perot said his new companys sole client is the postal service 
and that while it may acquire others in the future it is not 
intended to compete with eds 
frank said he and perot met for the first time last february 
after perot turned down the postmaster general job and frank 
accepted it

the house ethics committee is moving 
cautiously toward a hot political decision on whether to launch an 
investigation into allegations that speaker jim wright violated the 
chambers standards of conduct 
wright dtexas is publicly pressing for a quick resolution of 
the matter and insisting hell be cleared but the leaders of the 
panel of six democrats and six republicans said they were most 
interested in being thorough 
committee chairman julian dixon dcalif said after a 2hour 
closeddoor session thursday that the panel had not decided if a 
preliminary inquiry into the charges against wright was warranted 
the members of the committee had a thorough discussion of 
the issue and we have come to no resolve he said another 
meeting was scheduled for next thursday he said 
rep john myers of indiana the panels senior republican 
member said there were a lot of issues and it takes time to do 
it thoroughly 
the committee has a strict policy of silence until it completes 
action on any case thursdays meeting was its first on the wright 
case 
rep newt gingrich rga filed a complaint last week accusing 
his political enemy wright of several possible ethical breaches 
house rules require the ethics committee to examine any complaint 
filed by a member and gingrich has requested that an independent 
counsel be hired to handle the speakers case 
gingrichs complaint cited published reports that wright 
received unusually high royalties for his book that was printed by 
a texas associate who did nearly 300000 in business with wrights 
campaign 
it also pointed to actions by wright on behalf of texas oilmen 
with whom he had a financial relationship 
in one case wright lobbied former egyptian president anwar 
sadat concerning an oil well in territory egypt was taking from 
israel as a result of the camp david accord in the other wright 
contacted federal regulators 
wright has insisted his actions were what any congressman would 
do on behalf of his constituents and did not violate house rules 
ive said all along i have no fear or apprehension about them 
looking into these charges he said clearing them up quickly was 
important he said because it reflects the mood and the 
reputation of the house as an institution as well as his own 
standing 
democrats are also concerned that wrights troubles will hurt 
their effort to win the white house in november republicans are 
trying to use the case to blunt democratic attacks on alleged 
misdeeds in the reagan administration 
the ethics committee officially called the committee on 
standards of official conduct is the only panel in the 
democraticcontrolled house which is equally divided between the 
two parties 
just prior to thursdays committee meeting house republicans 
moved to make sure they had all six of their allotted members 
present and voting for the investigation 
rep floyd spence rsc recovering from a lung transplant 
operation resigned his committee seat and was replaced by rep

massive peasant protests are 
getting bigger bloodier and more frequent signaling strains on 
colombias centuriesold social system in which the rich get richer 
and the poor stay barefoot and hungry 
since president virgilio barco took office on aug 7 1986 
peasants have conducted 80 rural marches some of them numbering 
more than 10000 people 
the latest marches began may 22 when thousands of peasants 
gathered at a half dozen spots throughout the north 
one near the mountain town of san vicente about 160 miles north 
of the capital ended in gunfire leaving 10 peasants an army 
colonel and two other soldiers dead 
the protests indicated the government appears unwilling to 
reform its economic system they also showed a surprising unity 
among unions peasants and leftist parties in their discontent if 
not in their goals 
indeed leftist guerrillas apparently not finding enough 
revolutionary zeal in the countryside to suit them have taken to 
forcing peasants to participate in the marches 
two peasants in the san vicente march told the associated press 
in interviews that leftist guerrillas told them to join the protest 
or be killed others said they knew guerrillas were conscripting 
peasants for the march 
together with reports by cattle ranchers that the rebels are 
forcing them off their land it is becoming apparent that 
colombias 10000 leftist guerrillas are deemphasizing the urban 
battle and concentrating on the countryside 
the protests were organized by four organizations the national 
peasants association the countrys biggest union the workers 
unitary center and two leftist parties the patriotic union and 
the peoples front 
the patriotic union is the political arm of the countrys 
largest leftist guerrilla organization the colombian revolutionary 
armed forces a rebel group that follows moscows communist 
ideology 
the peoples front is the political arm of a maoist guerrilla 
group the peoples liberation army 
the march organizers said the peasants were demanding an end to 
right wing death squads who have killed more than 800 persons in 
the last three years 
the peasants also wanted a tax on oil produced by foreign 
companies the organizers said 
however when the peasants were interviewed it was obvious they 
do not share the same views as the march organizers 
the peasants never mentioned the death squads or oil they just 
said they wanted decent pay and to see their children be better off 
than they are 
rural children in colombia seldom go beyond the fifth grade 
schools beyond that level simply dont exist in many parts and 
when they do it costs too much for books uniforms and room and 
board for peasants to enroll their children 
around san vicente the peasants earn 150 for a 10hour day of 
picking cacao beans and clearing land 
that doesnt go far a small loaf of bread is 35 cents a pound 
of meat costs a days wages 
the government apparently is not getting the message about the 
possibility of more severe social upheaval in colombia 
while president barco is in europe and the united states on 
state visits the minister of government cesar gaviria trujillo 
is the acting president 
he said in a speech after the tragedy that ended the san vicente 
peasant march that he hoped the peasants learned their lesson 
there is little hope the congress will do anything it has 
trouble getting a quorum on days when it should be in session 
san vicente belies the grief that dwells in the town 
the town has a big white colonial church a small shady 
plaza houses with redtiled roofs and lots of flowers and pack 
animals tied in front of stores 
but interviews with dozens of townspeople indicated that about 
200 people in the san vicente area have been killed by right wing 
death squads in the last year 
storeowners had called a strike in sympathy with the peasant 
protest few of the stores in town were open anyway because the 
march had stopped the flow of meat and vegetables from the 
countryside 
but the funeral parlor was open employes there said they barely 
can keep up with demand for coffins 
three coffins with peasants killed during the protest march were 
in the funeral parlor a dozen candles flickered in the otherwise 
unlighted room 
the only sounds were weeping and the padding of peasants 
sandals and bare feet on the cement floor as they wandered in an 
out of funeral home

declaring that congress cannot 
micromanage the war on drugs a house panel is proposing 
creation of an administration drug coordinator who would have an 
instant 26 billion bank account 
the novel flexible approach was unveiled thursday by the six 
democrats and three republicans of the house appropriations 
subcommittee on commerce justice state and the judiciary the 
panel that dispenses most of the nations drug war money 
chairman neal smith diowa said the house leadership has not 
taken a position on the legislation 
traditionally congress allocates a set amount to an agency and 
breaks down how much should be spent for each major function over a 
particular period 
but smith said congress cannot keep up with the changing needs 
of the more than 30 frontline drug fighting agencies the 
coordinator would therefore decide how to dispense the money based 
on the needs of the moment smith said 
there is no way that the congress can micromanage a war 
on drugs any more than the congress could micromanage a war on the 
battlefield he said 
smith offered this example of how the system would work 
as an opportunity to curtail imports becomes available more 
money may suddenly be needed for the drug enforcement 
administration fbi border patrol coast guard immigration and 
naturalization service or one of the agencies involved in this 
aspect 
on the other hand if there have been some big busts more 
money will be needed for the courts for the marshals service for 
the prison services for prosecutors offices and various other 
agencies involved in enforcing the law 
the legislation is an appropriation bill which means the money 
would become available immediately if the president signed it 
usually omnibus drug bills are authorization measures that state 
congress intent to provide money but separate appropriations 
measures are then needed to actually make it available 
passage of an authorization does not guarantee that the 
appropriation will be approved or will be as much as the 
authorized spending ceiling 
the new proposal would exceed the budget ceiling reached at a 
summit agreement between president reagan and congress late 
last year the agreement permitted additional spending for dire 
emergencies a designation provided for the drug war money bill 
previous bills have called for a drug czar with authority to 
coordinate strategy among different agencies this bill differs 
because the coordinators only job would be to dispense the money 
rep harold rogers rky said the use of illegal drugs is the 
type of emergency the summit agreement had in mind 
despite our best efforts drugs are increasing in 
availability violence associated with these drugs is growing at a 
similarly alarming rate he said 
nonetheless rogers predicted a tough fight to win passage 
of the legislation because of budget constraints facing congress

panamas military has charged that a 
us government agency is operating a clandestine radio station to 
destabilize the government 
the defense forces press office in a statement thursday said 
the opposition radio constitucional is run by the foreign broadcast 
information service which it said is a cia operation 
the broadcast service collects information on everything that 
happens in latin america particularly panama the communique said 
it said the operation is based in the former panama canal zone 
the statement was the latest in a series issued by the military 
accusing the united states of plotting to undermine the government 
the us embassy denied that radio constitutional is linked to 
the foreign broadcast information service 
it said in a prepared statement that foreign broadcast has been 
a part of the embassy since 1979 and that it gathers information 
from newspapers and radio and television broadcasts and sends it to 
washington 
the embassy statement said the reports are open to the public 
and available to foreign governments by subscription 
before becoming a function of the embassy foreign broadcast was 
a part of the us southern command it added the command is the 
headquarters for us military activities in latin america 
radio constitucional apparently is operated by panamanians 
opposed to gen manuel antonio noriega chief of the 15000member 
defense forces and the countrys de facto leader 
the station has a very weak signal and few listeners are able to 
find it or keep it tuned in for long 
noriega is under federal indictment in the united states on drug 
trafficking charges the reagan administration has imposed economic 
and trade sanctions against panama in an effort to oust the general

the house has passed an 115 billion 
authorization bill for the national aeronautics and space 
administration that faces almost certain cutback in the senate 
the bill passed thursday on a 36026 vote includes 967 
million to start building a manned space station but nothing for a 
freeflying unmanned factory in space favored by the reagan 
administration 
some senators have expressed an inclination to vote for no more 
than 102 billion for nasa during the fiscal year that begins oct 
1 an amount that could kill the space station project 
the house authorization bill puts a cap of 242 billion on the 
total cost of the space station which is planned to be in orbit 
around earth and occupied by astronauts at the end of 1996 
the measure authorizes nasa spending for three years 144 
billion in 1990 and 157 billion in 1991 the amount for 1989 
would be an increase of 29 percent over the 89 billion authorized 
for this year 
the bill authorizes no funds for the proposed minispace station 
that would be carried into orbit by the space shuttle then leased 
by nasa from its developers for 700 million over five years 
it establishes a 12member national mars commission to 
prepare a detailed proposal for a joint manned mission to mars with 
the soviet union 
development of the advanced communications technology satellite 
which is strongly opposed by the reagan administration is 
authorized by the bill and the house calls for a flight 
demonstration of a hypersonic space plane one capable of flying 
at least five times the speed of sound by 1995

growth of us farm exports is being fueled 
mainly by larger soviet grain purchases according to agriculture 
department economists 
soviet purchases account for 68 percent of the total volume 
increase this year at 773 million metric tons total farm exports 
are running 21 percent ahead of the first six months of 1987 usda 
economists say 
thus far this year the soviets have purchased 93 million metric 
tons of us farm commodities with a value of more than 1 billion 
according to a world production and trade report issued by usda 
earlier this week the exports have been mainly wheat corn 
soybeans and soybean meal 
in the first half of last year the soviets bought 335700 tons 
of us commodities with a value of 427 million 
japanese purchases of us commodities were up in the first six 
months of the year by more than 2 million metric tons with big 
gains in wheat corn grain sorghum soybeans vegetable oils and 
horticultural products 
chinese purchases increased by 15 million metric tons the 
primary increases were in wheat corn soybeans and baby chicks 
the same commodities were the leaders as korea enlarged its buying 
by 695000 tons and there also was a marked rise in sales of 
cotton cattle hides and fruit juice 
wheat has been outpacing all other commodities as american 
exports surge largely because of the lower dollar federal export 
programs and reduced supplies abroad attributable to adverse 
weather 
wheat exports in the first six months of 1988 were 88 million 
tons or 764 million above the comparable figures for 1987 corn 
posted a gain of 34 million metric tons soybeans 898000 
vegetable oils 483000 horticultural products 322000 and cotton 
136000 metric tons 
the soviet union and china have been major wheat buyers along 
with various north african and mideast nations the fastest growing 
market for highvalue products such as vegetable oils meat and 
almonds have been the european community and the middle and 
highincome countries of the pacific basin

harvest the agriculture department says 
chinas projected 19 percent increase to a record 23 million

increase of 30 percent in producers returns last year for

countrys harvest 
us production is likely to increase 11 percent because of 
higher production quotas for burley and fluecured tobacco usda

a group of about 200 former highranking 
military officers is launching a campaign to challenge the widely 
held belief that israel needs the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
to defend itself 
the council for peace and security plans to use videotapes of 
popular war heros to contend that the nations defense will be 
enhanced not compromised if it gives up the occupied lands said 
council coordinator moshe amirav 
our first message is that there is nothing to be afraid of 
the state of israel is strong amirav saidwe are not standing 
on massada and we are not in the ghetto 
he was referring to the historic persection of jews massada is 
the desert fortress where jews killed themselves rather than 
surrender to roman rule in the 1st century ad ghettos were the 
walled areas in which european jews were forced to live 
the councils plans decided at a meeting sunday were outlined 
by amirav and several former generals they concern strategy for 
the occupied lands after an israeli withdrawal 
the council was formed last april and is not affiliated with any 
political party but its campaign is timed to have an impact on 
national elections nov 1 in which security is expected to be a 
major issue 
amirav said he hoped the generals could dispel the widespread 
perception that anyone who favors territorial compromise is 
soft on national defense 
we are going to kill a lot of holy cows and people are going 
to get very angry he said 
the generals argue that ruling over 15 million hostile 
palestinians poses a greater threat to israels security than 
returning the land occupied in the 1967 middle east war 
they say the occupation saps the army and the unresolved dispute 
could spark an attack by combined arab forces of a million soldiers 
in exchange for giving up some land israel could insist on 
certain defensive arrangements said council member yosef geva a 
businessman and reserve army major general 
amirav said the country then could devote the bulk of its 
energy funds and manpower to developing the economy strengthening 
the army and solving other pressing problems 
but israelis who have lived through six wars in 40 years are 
wary of returning to narrow pre1967 israel and fear what would 
happen if an armed palestinian state were formed next door 
to counter their fears the council has discussed such security 
options as making the west bank a demilitarized zone keeping 
israeli outposts in the area or stationing an international force 
there 
it plans to convey its ideas through videotapes of generals who 
fought in israels wars and even drop fliers from planes onto 
crowded beaches in the summer 
but even before the campaign got under way rightwing 
politicians attacked the council which is made up of scholars and 
businessmen as well as 30 major generals 80 brigadier generals and 
100 colonels all in the active reserve 
dont be such big heroes said parliament member rafael 
eitan the hardline politician who was the armys chief of staff 
during israels 1982 lebanon invasion when people are free of 
responsibilities their tongue is long 
geula cohen whose tehiya party favors annexing the territories 
accused the group of working for foreign minister shimon peres 
labor party 
labor favors giving up some lands seized in 1967 to win peace 
with the arabs the rival likud bloc of prime minister yitzhak 
shamir is against returning any arab land 
amirav who was expelled from the likud for holding secret 
meetings with palestinian leaders said hardline politicians use 
fear to manipulate the israeli public and gain votes 
they present security and peace as opposites but we will 
stop this and show that peace is security amirav said 
shlomo gazit a reserve major general and former head of army 
intelligence noted that demographic trends indicate the arab 
population in israel and the territories could outnumber the jewish 
population in the next century because of higher arab birth rates 
if that happens he said israel may have to withdraw 
unilaterally from the territories and not have the luxury of 
demanding security arrangements

report that nonetheless concludes eastern and sister carrier 
continental airlines are being run safely 
the report came after an unprecedented investigation of both 
eastern and continental as well its holding company texas air 
corp by the transportation department and the federal aviation 
administration 
the departments report released thursday said easterns 
bitter labor problems have divided the company posing the risk of 
an adverse impact on the public safety 
the federal aviation administration plans to continue its 
special surveillance of eastern and a special emissary is being 
dispatched to try to deescalate the tensions within the 
company said transportation secretary jim burnley 
burnley said former labor secretary william brock has been 
enlisted to try to open new lines of communications between 
easterns labor unions and management over safety issues 
brocks role is limited to the safety related aspects of this 
problem and brock would not deal with bargaining issues 
brock said he had talked with all the parties at eastern and has 
found a willingness to listen but burnley seemed less 
optimistic 
frankly given the extraordinary nature of this matter 
neither he brock or i can predict a successful conclusion 
burnley told a news conference 
texas air chairman frank lorenzo welcomed brocks participation 
henry duffy the president of the air line pilots association 
suggested the move reflects the unprecedented problems that exist 
at eastern 
in miami charles bryan the head of easterns machinists union 
gave no sign of wanting to be conciliatory he accused the 
transportation department of supporting and cooperating with 
lorenzo and called the departments report the best possible 
report that money can buy a reference to texas airs recently 
expanded lobbying efforts in washington 
the dispute has been a result of texas airs demand for wage 
concessions from the unions representing eastern employees and 
from its attempt to sell off assets in what the unions say is an 
attempt to dismantle the airline it acquired in november 1986 
lorenzo characerized the overall dot findings as confirming that 
eastern and continental are absolutely safe and absolutely fit 
those airlines passed inspection with flying colors 
the dot began its close scrutiny of eastern continental and 
texas air in midapril including special inspections by the faa 
that covered 630 eastern and continental aircraft over a 30day 
period 
during the inspection period 30 percent of easterns 280 planes 
had to be be taken out of service at least once because of safety 
violations at continental safety violations resulted in 143 
percent of its 350 planes being taken out of service at least once 
about 7 percent of the 1542 inspections at eastern and 3 
percent of the 2689 inspections at continental resulted in safety 
violations being discovered according to the agency 
faa officials have characterized many of the infractions as 
being minor with many of them involving fuel or hydraulic leaks or 
miscellaneous problems an unsafe condition does not currently 
exist at either eastern or continental said faa administrator 
allan mcartor 
burnley meanwhile said that the departments indepth 
examination of texas air corp the holding company for both 
eastern and continental found nothing to substantiate concerns 
about the companys management or finances 
the review by a special task force of dot lawyers and auditors 
concluded that 
despite the companys 466 million in losses last year it has 
substantial assets and access to capital and that both 
continental and eastern are considered financially viable in the 
near term 
no evidence was found that a series of controversial financial 
transactions by texas air corp including the sale of easterns 
lucrative computer reservation system and the proposed sale of its 
northeast shuttle were an attempt to bleed easterns assets 
texas airs management is fit willing and able to operate 
a commercial airline company and there is no basis for serious 
concern about texas air managements competence

when the vice president of the united states 
the certain republican nominee to be the next president kicks 
around two conservative activists few americans ever heard of 
eyebrows go up and the question is asked why did george bush do 
it 
even defenders of richard viguerie and howard phillips conceded 
on thursday that they had done plenty the past seven years to 
provoke a sharp reaction from bush 
in an interview published in the new york times bush dismissed 
the pair as almost selfappointed spokesmen 
ive been pounded by these two people for years he said 
but for the most part they have ignored the vice president and 
concentrated their fire on ronald reagan whom they accused of 
abandoning the conservative agenda 
viguerie a pioneer in directmail fundraising for conservative 
causes denounced reagan on the final day of the moscow summit as 
americas no 1 apologist for the soviet union and suggested 
the president had taken leave of his senses 
phillips chairman of the conservative caucus has been equally 
critical of the president 
but was there anything for bush to gain politically from his 
attack was he taking a risk do viguerie and phillips have a 
following that bush desperately needs to defeat democrat michael 
dukakis in the fall presidential election 
given that bush is confronted almost daily with polls saying 
dukakis is running ahead of him nationwide and in several key 
states many republicans doubted the wisdom of alienating even 
people with a small following 
its a mistake to publicly come out and write off anybody 
said rep mickey edwards rokla a former chairman of the 
american conservative union unless he added he was doing it 
to try to establish to whatever audience that hes not a 
rightwinger but nobody has ever thought he was 
to the small band of gop moderates though bushs words were a 
welcome signal 
i think that bush is making it clear that while he is 
conservative on many issues he is not a tool of the new right 
forces said rep jim leach of iowa that has implications for 
policy as well as for appointments 
it doesnt serve george bush any useful purpose to attack 
people who have constituencies that might support him said lyn 
nofziger former white house political director 
hes not running against dick viguerie and hes not running 
against howie phillips hes running against probably mike dukakis 
and you really ought to keep your eye on the ball said nofziger 
he won the nomination said rep newt gingrich rga a 
leader of house conservatives he deserves the respect of the 
conservative movement 
but how much of the conservative movement can phillips and 
viguerie claim to represent 
bush descreibed them as two individuals who dont have any 
following 
phillips asked how much of a following he has said bush does 
not have to worry about me i only have one vote he said 
conservative caucus has several hundred thousand supporters 
edwards said viguerie and phillips are not the conservative 
movement theyre just a couple of guys 
i think they have a very tiny following said gingrich 
and a very large press kit 
but that brings up the original question why would a man of 
bushs stature publicly attack two people with so little following 
obviously theyve gotten to him said eddie mahe a 
republican political consultant who called the attack totally 
out of character for a man who believes campaigns function 
better when they are inclusive rather than exclusive 
rep robert dornan of california a bush supporter said i 
think its kind of sad i was hoping he wouldnt react to their 
earlier goading i thought the whole thing was calmed down and 
wed all be pulling together on one team

lawmakers rejected an attempt to call an 
early presidential election and allowed president jose sarney to 
complete a fiveyear term ending in 1990 even though polls 
indicated that voters want elections now 
the congress sitting as a constituent assembly to rewrite the 
constitution on thursday voted 328 in favor of a fiveyear term 
and 222 in favor of four years 
leftist lawmakers wanted the election in november this year but 
the assembly decided the countrys estimated 75 million eligible 
voters will go to the polls in november 1989 brazilians have not 
voted for a president since 1960 
the voting which began after nine hours of debate was 
interrupted repeatedly by shouts of elections now and sarney 
out after the vote legislators unveiled a huge sign that read 
five years betrayal of the people 
polls taken over the past year consistently have shown a 
majority of brazils 143 million people want presidential elections 
this year 
the fiveyear term is subject to a final vote but political 
analysts say it will pass when the entire constitution is voted 
chapter by chapter later this year 
the issue has been one of the most heated of the constituent 
assembly which already has approved the fiveyear term for future 
presidents the current constitution gives presidents a sixyear 
mandate 
lawmakers elected in 1986 have been spending the last 14 months 
writing a new constitution to replace the one handed down by a 
military junta in 1969 
sarney 57 took office in 1985 as the running mate of tancredo 
neves who died before taking office neves was a civilian selected 
in an electoral college vote to pave the way for nonmilitary rule 
the military government had ruled since a 1964 coup 
sarney who was leader of the militarybacked social democratic 
party before taking office has often alluded to a military threat 
if the assembly shortened his term sarney still counts the 
military chiefs among his closest supporters 
my duty is to leave the nation institutionalized and not allow 
the climate of freedom and consolidation to turn into a prague 
spring sarney said in a recent interview with the respected 
daily gazeta mercantil newspaper 
sarney was referring to the popular protests demanding 
democratic reforms in czechoslovakia 20 years ago that were crushed 
by soviet troops 
sarney has maintained that uncertainty over his term has kept 
him from properly running the country deprived him of a strong 
political base and is a reason for brazils economic problems 
critics charge sarney has only been concerned with his term 
allowing inflation to soar to a projected annual rate of 600 
percent and investment to drop to almost zero

aids eventually will kill 99 percent of the 
people infected with the virus according to a new study that says 
it takes an average of 78 years for the disease itself to show up 
the fatality projection contradicts the suggestion of some that 
only a small percentage of those infected with the aids virus will 
actually develop the disease 
weve got to expect the worst weve got to assume that it 
will happen said william w darrow a researcher with the 
federal centers for disease control and coauthor of the report 
thats the message of this study 
the study conducted jointly by the cdc and the san francisco 
department of public health is to be published friday in the 
magazine science it found that the incubation period for the aids 
virus the time from exposure until development of a 
lifethreatening disease averaged 78 years among 84 homosexual 
men who were proven by blood tests to have been infected with the 
aids virus 
darrow said that cdc mathemetician kungjong lui analyzed the 
health records of the 84 men who had taken part in a hepatitis 
study between 1978 and 1980 blood samples taken for the hepatitis 
study were reexamined for the human immunodeficiency virus which is 
the agent that causes aids 
using the blood samples the researchers were able to determine 
within a few months the date on which the men were infected with 
the virus 
the study then followed the medical history of the men and found 
that 21 had developed aids by january 1987 
lui projected the average incubation period from exposure to hiv 
to expression of aids at 78 years 
this result implies that the aids epidemic will continually 
increase for the next several years if no effective treatment 
becomes available to prevent the progression of hiv1 infection 
from an asymptomatic stage to clinical aids the study said 
earlier studies have shown that persons infected with the hiv 
virus can develop antibodies to the virus within a matter of 
months and that the virus then can remain latent for a long period 
before patients develop the deadly diseases associated with aids 
darrow said luis study establishes a model for projecting the 
probable outcome of the average patient who has tested positive for 
aids 
george w rutherford coauthor of the study and an executive 
with the aids office of the department of public health in san 
francisco said the study is important because it will help 
officials plan an allocation of resources to treat the disease 
though this is only a math model it is important because it 
addresses the incubation period of aids said rutherford this 
is one of the major variables 
he said san francisco now expects to have 17000 cases of aids 
by 1993 and is making plans to provide care for this number of 
critically ill patients other cities rutherford said can use 
this model to make similar plans 
aids short for acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the 
bodys immune system killing cells that protect the body from 
disease when the cells are destroyed the patient becomes 
susceptible to infections and rare cancers that often are fatal 
aids generally is spread through sexual contact among drug 
users who share needles infected blood or blood products and from 
infected pregnant women to their babies 
as of may 23 aids had been diagnosed in 62740 americans of 
whom more than half or 35188 had died according to the cdc no 
one is known to have recovered from aids

advancement of science

jesse jackson walked into the heart of the 
citys gang territory and emerged shaking his head after hearing 
tales of violence drugs and failed government policies 
in a real sense they feel they have no way out said the 
democratic presidential contender he was flanked by a dozen 
members of the bounty hunters offshoot set of the bloods gang 
whose violent lives were depicted in the film colors 
with secret service agents at his side the democratic candidate 
met with reporters after a twohour meeting thursday with gang 
members inside the gymnasium at the 5000resident nickerson 
gardens project a housing area plagued by gang crime 
desperation was the message heard by jackson whose candidacy 
and interest in the community briefly eased its sense of 
hopelessness 
im glad he came i think its a lot of hope said maurice 
washington 16 who identified himself as a member of the bounty 
hunters 
another gang member who met with jackson identifying himself 
only as dog said the violence will stop only when parents 
wrestle back control of their children 
i told him jackson to tell these parents to watch their 
kids police aint gonna do it its gotta start in the home 
said dog pointing to the seemingly endless rows of 
graffitiscarred buildings in the projects 
they believe unlimited access to guns and drugs compounds the 
crisis because a combination of the drugs the guns and the money 
creates a kind of unholy triangle in the situation jackson said 
a gang is nothing but an organized group of people who form in 
an act of desperation and hopelessness and turns to unacceptable 
antisocial behavior jackson said 
he complained that government programs and services aimed at 
heading off gang violence and helping residents of the gangplagued 
neighborhoods arent coordinated 
after all these killings why hasnt leadership on all levels 
been convened asked jackson he condemned the lack of day care 
job training and scholarship recruitment in nickerson gardens 
one young man said there are no equal rights there are only 
equal wrongs the candidate said 
i offer the youth today a partnership jackson said i 
will have to fight the flow of drugs they must cut demand for 
drugs 
in many ways these young people these grapes have been 
turned into raisins grapes of hope are now raisins of despair 
their powers to believe have been turned into cynicism the 
candidate said 
the jackson campaign touted the meeting in the ganginfested 
projects as a private dialogue with leaders of the bloods and 
crips but those at the table were actually former members and 
young lowechelon members 
it doesnt really make any difference jackson said 
city councilman nate holden pointed out here you never 
really get out of a gang 
steve valdivia the director of community youth gang services 
which helped arrange the meeting was impressed with jacksons 
visit 
in a community that reproduces gang members an environment 
where there is no choice but to be on the wrong side of the law i 
can see a need for 10 jesse jacksons valdivia said 
we dont have those leaders here leaders here dont see 
beyond there own limited agenda he said the fact is law and 
order is not the endall to everything jesse jackson realizes 
thats not where it starts or ends it always has been and always 
will be social and economic issues 
when a man like that comes in and says he cares and wants to 
do something about it and has the power then im all for it 
asked why leaders of the crips and bloods werent in on the 
meeting valdivia explained there are over 250 sets of crips and 
bloods 
there is no way in the world you can get all those groups 
together in one place and have peaceful coexistence he said 
more than 380 people were killed in gang violence in los angeles 
county last year 
some local residents many of whom have lost friends and 
relatives to gang shootings expressed hope at the attention 
jackson brought to their concerns but also skepticism that any 
changes could be achieved 
i dont know i doubt it said james tapla 17 who 
described himself as a bounty hunter marked by rival gangs 
you cant go nowhere without somebody wanting to beat you down 
or shoot you i lost three close friends to gang violence he 
said im tired of it its time for this to stop

japan has called on israel to withdraw completely 
from southern lebanon and improve its treatment of palestinians in 
the occupied gaza strip and west bank 
officials from the foreign ministry also said thursday that 
japanese foreign minister sosuke uno is expected to urge israel to 
withdraw from the occupied west bank and gaza strip when he visits 
israel at the end of june 
japan plays a small political role in the middle east but its 
economic role especially its purchases of oil and its exportation 
of hightechnology equipment is substantial 
since the israeli invasion into lebanon in june 1982 japan 
has consistently called for an unconditional israeli withdrawal 
from lebanon foreign ministry spokesman koichi haraguchi told a 
regular news conference id like to take this opportunity on 
the sixth anniversary to reaffirm that there has been no change in 
this policy 
referring to israels actions against arab protesters in the 
occupied territories haraguchi said the current handling of the 
palestinian people in those areas is not kindly welcomed and we 
express our hope that the current conduct will be stopped 
immediately 
foreign minister uno is scheduled to visit israel as part of a 
sixday fournation middle east tour beginning june 22 he will be 
the highest ranking japanese official ever to visit israel the 
officials said 
about 200 palestinians have been killed in the west bank and 
gaza strip since the antioccupation uprising began nearly six 
months ago

democratic presidential contender michael 
dukakis held a solid lead over rival jesse jackson according to 
the latest survey here but jackson was gaining ground the poll 
suggested 
the survey taken by the san francisco examiner and television 
station kron indicated the massachusetts governor led jackson by 
24 percentage points 52 percent to 28 percent twenty percent were 
undecided 
the poll of 600 registered democrats questioned on tuesday and 
wednesday had a margin of error of 4 percentage points the 
examiner reported in thursdays editions 
a similar survey taken in midmay suggested dukakis was 
leading by 37 percentage points 60 percent to 23 percent 
while jackson has shown growth the last couple of weeks he 
continues to have an extremely narrow base said examiner 
pollster stephen teichner he faces a pretty big task in closing 
the gap 
teichner said a low turnout on election day would help jackson 
because his base appears to be extremely committed 
in the more recent poll black voters were backing jackson by a 
72 percent to 9 percent margin in the most recent poll asians 
continued to overwhelmingly support dukakis by a margin of 61 
percent to 20 percent hispanics split 47 percent to 34 percent in 
favor of dukakis

bank where two armed robbers were holding 17 hostages and waiting 
for a crowd outside to disperse so they could make a getaway

thursday authorities said the building did not hold enough to 
satisfy their demand 
there were no reports of injuries 
twenty police officers were stationed around the bank of brazil

night until a crowd of about 3000 people that had gathered around 
the bank building thinned those standing outside the bank were 
relatives and friends of the hostages as well as onlookers 
the robbers said not to worry about the hostages they will be 
safe barbosa said he added that police were trying to persuade 
onlookers to go home

doors shortly after the bank closed pretending to be late 
customers he said they took out revolvers and grabbed security 
guards guns 
barbosa said the bank alarm connected to a local police 
station rang at about 6 pm but he didnt know what time the 
robbers had entered the bank brazilian banks usually close their 
doors to customers at 430 pm

inflation is running at a projected annual rate of 600 percent and 
the cost of living for the average worker has soared by about 60 
percent over the last two years according to labor union studies

the surgery being performed today on kitty 
dukakis wife of democratic presidential frontrunner michael 
dukakis is aimed at relieving spinal cord pressure that could 
cause nerve damage and even paralysis 
mrs dukakis 53 wife of the democratic presidential 
frontrunner has herniated discs this is a common and for most 
victims not very serious hazard of middle age and beyond 
however mrs dukakis case is more complicated and difficult 
instead of having just one damaged disc she has two of them and 
instead of being in the lower back where most occur hers are in 
her neck 
but worst of all her discs are pushing on her spinal cord and 
this if uncorrected could eventually cause permanent damage and 
perhaps paralysis of the lower parts of her body 
mrs dukakis had been bothered by the condition for weeks but 
in recent days it had grown worse causing numbness and altered 
sensations in both her hands and feet 
she checked into massachusetts general hospital for evaluation 
on wednesday night and by thursday the doctors had made their 
decision immediate surgery was necessary 
in view of the fact that this condition has quite definitely 
worsened in the past 24 to 48 hours it was felt that waiting even 
until next week was taking a chance said dr james r lehrich a 
neurologist 
however he added that mrs dukakiss condition appeared to have 
been spotted early and there was no sign of permanent harm to her 
spine 
the operation which he described as major surgery is called 
cervical laminectomy 
mrs dukakiss problems result from two herniated or slipped 
discs in her neck these discs serve as soft cushions between the 
bony vertebrae that protect her spinal cord 
in her case the discs between the fourth and sixth vertebrae 
below her skull were squeezed out of place so that they pressed on 
the spinal cord 
at boston university medical center dr ronald mortara said 
most people with herniated discs are treated first with bed rest 
traction and pain killers surgery is used only as a last resort 
if you keep that up for a few weeks a great number of people 
will get better and not need further treatment he said if 
someone has any evidence of spinal cord compression that becomes 
much more serious and urgent 
lehrich said disc troubles can result from an injury or occur 
spontaneously and the doctors are unsure what caused mrs 
dukakiss problems 
we have seen no trauma unless you consider that she has been 
a dancer and moved her neck a lot he said 
mrs dukakis has been a student and teacher of modern dance for 
three decades 
the goal of the operation was to remove bone from mrs dukakiss 
hip and use it to replace the damaged discs her recovery in the 
hospital was expected to take one or two weeks or longer 
lehrich said that serious complications of the surgery are very 
rare although they can include paralysis if the spinal cord is 
damaged 
mrs dukakiss condition was diagnosed in california where her 
husband massachusetts gov michael s dukakis was campaigning for 
the states primary

a former franciscan monk serving an 18 to 
20year sentence for assault and battery will meet his pen pal 
mother teresa on saturday when she begins a visit to three state 
prisons at his invitation 
donald ouimet who has corresponded with mother teresa for the 
past two years said he hopes her visit will spread the healing 
warmth of love among inmates at the prison 20 miles south of 
boston 
walpole prison has been recognized as a holding pen for the 
lowest of the low but every now and then a ray of hope shines 
ouimet told a news conference thursday inside massachusetts only 
maximumsecurity prison i hope this saturday a ray of hope will 
shine when a little nun from india comes 
mother teresa who won the 1979 nobel peace prizefor her work 
with the destitute diseased and dying established the missionary 
sisters of charity in calcutta india in 1948 today the roman 
catholic order operates more than 30 homes in 80 countries 
the yugoslavianborn nun will also visit prisons at concord and 
framingham traveling by helicopter said state department of 
correction spokeswoman kathleen ayres 
at walpole inmates plan to present mother teresa with a pen 
drawing of the nun in front of a comment she once made we are 
like a pencil in gods hands even though the instrument is 
imperfect the writing is beautiful 
ouimet said inmates were excited about her impending arrival 
and said he hoped her visit would uplift them 
ouimet encouraged by a prison chaplain and a new york city nun 
began writing mother teresa in 1986 and first invited her to visit 
last year he has written continually and has received four 
letters from her 
ouimet said he has been religious all his life after graduating 
from a parochial high school in holyoke in western massachusetts 
he became a capuchin franciscan monk joining the st pius x friary 
in middletown conn as a lay brother 
after four years there ouimet left he said hes still not sure 
why 
it was springtime and the birds were singing and i wanted to 
live the good life said the gregarious ouimet little did i 
know the good life would lead to the good life behind bars 
in 1965 just a few years after leaving the monastery ouimet 
was convicted of aggravated assault he served nine years at 
walpole before his release in 1974 ouimet returned to western 
massachusetts and worked odd jobs mostly as a cook 
around 1985 he was arrested in four separate incidents of 
aggravated assault ouimet said he said he assaulted a man and a 
woman in the incidents but did not provide details 
thats not the issue he said whats here and now is the 
issue i have nothing no life in the streets my life is in here 
though walpole is known as a tough prison ouimet said he 
doesnt want to leave despite being eligible for parole in 10 
years he said he believed the 1985 assaults might have resulted 
from an unconscious desire to return to prison 
i prefer it here theres security i dont have to pay rent 
dont have to pay for lights ouimet said im comfortable 
here 
ouimet said he plans to continue corresponding with mother 
teresa who he says has broadened his outlook he hopes his fellow 
inmates will have the same experience when they meet her saturday 
we are poor in spirit poor in emotion and poor in material 
possessions he said but in the eyes of our father we have a 
great dignity

nicaragua said rebels based in 
honduras attacked army troops inside nicaragua and accused an 
official of nicaraguas leading business organization of running a 
spy network for the cia 
on wednesday the honduran armed forces claimed sandinista army 
soldiers attacked the san agustin military post located six miles 
inside honduras a day before honduras said the nicaraguan troops 
were driven off and that an unknown number were killed 
nicarguas foreign minister miguel descoto said thursday the 
fighting occurred in nicaragua and that a soldier had been captured 
and taken to san agustin 
responding to a protest note by honduran foreign minister carlos 
lopez descoto said 
the crude manipulation of the facts contained in your note 
reveals the real aim of this campaign to try to create an 
incident between honduras and nicaragua and to undermine peace 
talks between the leftist government and the ussupported rebels 
known as contras 
acts that occurred in nicaragua are being presented as if they 
occurred on honduran soil and the armed forces of honduras 
takes upon itself crimes that in reality have been committed by the 
contras he said 
the contras have maintained bases in honduras throughout the 
6yearold civil war the two sides agreed to a temporary 
ceasefire on march 23 while they continue negotiations on a 
permanent truce 
the interior ministry said mario jose alegria castillo director 
of the institute of economic and social research had worked for 
the cia since 1985 and organized a network of informing agents in 
some institutions of the nicaraguan state 
alegria castillo was detained on tuesday 
in a statement released wednesday night the ministry said pedro 
su olivas of the central bank and adrian espinales of the ministry 
of commerce also were arrested 
alegria castillo and his secretary dora aldana centeno were 
tied to the crime of stealing documents with a secret 
classification by the nicaraguan state the ministry said mrs 
aldana centeno was detained briefly tuesday and released 
the research institute is affiliated with the superior council 
of private enterprise and publishes economic information bulletins 
based on official and private publications 
in a statement issued thursday night the council said alegria 
castillos detention was nothing more than another manuever of 
the familiar routine of the government 
it said sandinista security agents confiscated several documents 
from the offices of the council and the research institute 
including material published by the central bank the agents warned 
council and institute employees that the possession of this 
material was illegal the statement said 
enrique bolanos president of the council said wednesday the 
detentions were illegal

palestinian inmates complained of heat 
hunger and humiliation to foreign journalists who toured this 
prison camp for the first time since the sixmonth uprising began 
in the occupied territories 
this center in the negev desert held 2483 palestinians 
detained without trial of those 2061 have been sentenced to up 
to six months in jail 
many are teachers journalists doctors and community leaders 
imprisoned to prevent the spread of unrest which began dec 8 
the journalists talked thursday with the prisoners who live in 
clusters of open tents 
they said i was active in politics but i believe i am here 
because i am a journalist said qasem ali who worked parttime 
for the associated press 
i think conditions here made the people more radical and 
created more hatred and this is the problem said ali 29 who 
stood behind a fence topped with barbed wire he smoked one of five 
cigarettes given to each inmate daily 
prisoners complained of being made to kneel hands behind their 
backs for lengthy twicedaily roll calls in the scorching heat at 
the prison located near the egyptian border 20 miles south of the 
occupied gaza strip 
being made to kneel was the principle complaint of abdel aziz 
randisi a pediatrician from khan yunis in the gaza strip who was 
jailed for six months without trial on march 20 
randisi said prisoners who break any of the camps manifold rules 
are forced to kneel 
i will refuse really our hearts are grieving and we would 
rather die than do this kneeling he said 
at one point prisoners brought out saad dahdour 21 of gaza 
who had a bruise over his right eye and said he was made to stand 
in a toilet and beaten after arguing with guards about treatment 
for a toothache 
other complaints included a ban on mass gatherings that 
prevented group prayers on the moslem sabbath not enough water to 
bathe frequently to wash off the desert dust small portions of 
food infrequent newspapers and a ban on radio and television 
col david tzemach the camp commander showed reporters a 
storeroom with fresh produce and large amounts of canned meat he 
also cited roundtheclock medical care and frequent visits by the 
red cross 
referring to complaints that inmates were made to sit in the hot 
sun for 30minute roll calls he snapped they are liars they 
dont sit in the sun for that long it only takes 10 minutes for a 
roll call 
he said mass gatherings were banned after friday prayer services 
turned into political rallies with palestinians singing nationalist 
songs and in one case throwing stones 
tzemach recalled that on one occasion more than 100 prisoners 
reported sick with stomach aches and fevers but doctors found only 
three to be sick 
it was just a big show he said 
prisoners also said family visits were not allowed tzemach said 
these were suspended after a bus carrying visitors was stopped in 
the occupied west bank and burned by arab protesters who opposed 
such visits since they involved cooperating with the israelis 
rejecting accusations of beatings tzemach said the maximum 
punishment was three days in an isolation cell a punishment 
usually imposed only for those who try to incite revolt or violence 
against guards 
for minor offenses like refusing to come out for roll call 
prisoners are made to stand in the corner the camp commander 
said 
earlier this week the human rights group law in the service of 
man urged that the camp be closed saying the conditions were 
inhumane 
it said prisoners were moved from the occupied territories into 
israel in violation of the geneva convention governing the 
treatment of civilians in occupied areas

a trade group representing aspirin makers agrees 
with the governments caution that aspirin may do more harm than 
good in some patients who want to reduce heartattack risk and 
that more research is needed 
dr thomas bryant president of the aspirin foundation said 
thursday that the food and drug administration is eminently 
sensible in its view that widescale promotion of aspirin to 
reduce coronary risk would be premature 
taking aspirin to prevent heart attacks may increase some 
peoples chances of dying of other things especially hemorrhagic 
strokes the fda said in a commentary in todays journal of the 
american medical association 
findings released in january indicated that taking an aspirin 
every other day reduced the risk of first nonfatal heart attacks 
by 47 percent in 11000 male doctors over five years compared with 
11000 who took a nonaspirin substitute 
the report helped boost nationwide aspirin sales by 41 percent 
to about 190 million tablets in the first week of february 
although sales later tailed off to about the level of the previous 
year according to figures from nielsen marketing research 
the fda persuaded aspiring manufacturers in march to hold off 
advertising aspirins effects at reducing first heart attacks and 
the washington dcbased foundation knew the fda planned to 
publish its views this week bryant said 
aspirin tends to promote bleeding by reducing the ability of 
blood platelets to help form clots heart attacks usually occur 
when clots lodge in the arteries feeding the heart and deprive the 
heart muscle of blood 
but aspirin may increase health risks for people who already 
have clotting problems or for those who have high blood pressure 
which puts them at increased risk for hemorrhagic strokes the fda 
commentary said 
strokes are the result of brain damage caused by bleeding in the 
brain or by blood clots hemorrhagic strokes are those caused by 
bleeding 
the fda commentary pointed to 10 hemorrhagic strokes recorded 
among the 11000 subjects taking aspirin in the study compared 
with two such strokes among 11000 subjects taking the substitute 
overall death rates for the two groups were the same though the 
aspirin groups nonfatal heartattack rate was much lower there 
were 104 nonfatal heart attacks among the aspirin users and 189 in 
the comparison group 
physicians will for a time be forced to make their 
professional judgments about aspirin use on the basis of incomplete 
information said the fda commentary cowritten by agency 
director dr frank e young 
we agree with them completely said dr julie buring a 
harvard university researcher who participated in the aspirin study 
she added in a telephone interview thursday that a further 
analysis of the data to try to determine which people will benefit 
most is under way and researchers expect to report to the fda in 
late fall 
aspirin has been known since 1985 to reduce the risk of second 
heart attacks and certain kinds of heart pain 
dr robert a temple coauthor of the fda commentary said 
aspirin may be very beneficial at reducing heartattack risk in 
older men but not beneficial at all in younger women who tend to 
have low heartattack risks to begin with 
if aspirin were absolutely benign you wouldnt worry about 
this but it isnt absolutely benign he said in a telephone 
interview thursday 
the fda commentary noted that a british study of 5000 male 
physicians found aspirin failed to protect against heart attacks 
and that it was associated with a 2fold increase of disabling 
strokes

toxic metals in the bright colors favored by four 
great artists may have given them rheumatic diseases according to 
a british medical weekly 
peter paul rubens pierre auguste renoir raoul dufy and paul 
klee who were fond of bright yellow red white green blue and 
violet paints may have been heavily exposed to the toxic metals in 
them said two danish doctors in the june 4 issue of the lancet 
they said the metals could have caused the rheumatoid arthritis 
suffered by rubens renoir and dufy and the scleroderma which 
leaves the skin hard and rigid that affected klee 
the doctors listed the metals as mercury cadmium arsenic 
lead antimony chromium tin copper cobalt and manganese 
exposure to these metals may be of importance in the 
development of inflammatory rheumatic diseases said dr lisbet 
pedersen and dr henrik permin of the university hospitals in 
copenhagen 
rubens lived from 1577 to 1640 renoir 18411919 dufy 18771953 
and klee 18791940 
the doctors said they reached their findings after examining 
paintings by the four artists and by eight others without rheumatic 
disease who lived at the same times and who favored paler 
earthier colors containing harmless iron and carbon compounds 
impoverished artists lived cooked and ate in their studios 
and water and food could easily have been contaminated by toxic 
heavy metals from pigments the doctors said 
the doctors said that personal habits also had a role 
renoir was a heavy smoker of handrolled cigarettes so pigments 
containing mercury could have been transferred to the cigarettes 
from his hands the studios of poor artists would have been heated 
by a stove on which paintsoaked clothes and discarded paintings 
would be burned as cheap fuel giving off toxic metal fumes 
some of the artists licked their brushes and thereby ingested 
mercury 
artists today use less toxic pigments tubes of paint carry 
warning labels and artists know that they should not lick brushes 
or burn colors indoors the doctors said 
artists today are not so exposed but heavy metal 
contamination in food and drinking water exists and experience from 
the occupational exposure of old masters is still relevant they 
said

catastrophic health insurance bill approved thursday by the house 
and sent to the senate for final legislative action 
hospital full coverage for 365 days a year of hospital bills 
after a onceayear deductible estimated at 564 in 1989 the 
deductible is indexed to rising hospital costs medicare now 
charges a deductible for each hospital stay during a year and 
provides full payment for just 59 days a year 
doctor bills full payment of reasonable and proper doctor 
bills after a 1370 annual cap is met medicare continues to pay 
80 percent of charges after a 75 deductible both the initial 
deductible and the 20 percent patient copayment will count toward 
the 1370 cap patient remains responsible for that portion of 
fees that exceed the amount allowed by medicare 
drugs medicare pays 50 percent of outpatient drug costs after 
a 600 annual deductible starting in 1991 medicare pays 60 
percent the following year and 80 percent in 1993 and thereafter 
with the deductible to be indexed to rising drug costs medicare 
now has no acrosstheboard prescription drug coverage 
costs to be paid solely by medicare beneficiaries current 
part b premium of 2480 to increase by 4 a month in 1989 by 
1993 the catastrophic monthly premium is projected at 1020 
in addition to whatever the regular part b premium is at that time 
more than 60 percent of total program costs are to be financed by 
an additional supplemental premium that is linked to federal 
income tax liability the supplemental starts at 2250 a year per 
150 of tax liability in 1989 rising to 42 a year per 150 of tax 
liability in 1993

mikhail s gorbachevs human touch warmed a 
friendly crowd of peace activists who came to the kremlin to praise 
his policies and offer him gifts ranging from a toy for his 
granddaughter to a chicago bears sweatshirt 
on a day that president reagan left moscow americans and other 
westerners talked excitedly and hugged each other after addressing 
gorbachev and walking up to the front of the kremlins circular 
sverdlov hall to present him with a gift 
the 57yearold soviet leaders wit and selfassurance which 
have overcome the stereotype of old and ailing soviet leaders 
dominated thursdays threehour session with hundreds of peace 
activists 
he combined the style of an american politician on the stump 
with the substance of soviet policies he defended soviet positions 
on human rights arms control and perestroika his 
restructuring drive 
the activists many of whom said they already supported a number 
of soviet policies applauded frequently 
gorbachev praised them for their efforts i can now see that 
public initiatives are ahead of politics gorbachev said 
among the gifts he received were a plaque proclaiming his home a 
zone of peace a solarpowered watch a peace now tshirt 
posters paintings and an american indian peace pipe 
i think were going to have an exhibition after this 
meeting he said at one point an exhibition of souvenirs 
william sloan coffin vietnam warera chaplain at yale 
university and former senior minister at new yorks riverside 
church told gorbachev the united states has traditionally been 
ahead in the arms race but in the race to disarm the roles 
apparently are reversed 
hes the statesman weve been waiting for said marty 
coleman of pasadena calif who presented gorbachev with a toy 
from her granddaughter amanda to give to his granddaughter oxana 
gorbachev observed that a grandmothers association existed in 
the soviet union but added its now necessary to create a 
grandfathers association 
later he returned to the theme addressing a woman who 
represented an organization called grandmothers for peace i 
suggest the founding of a rival organization he said 
man my knees are shaking said russell red bear an 
american indian representative as he returned to his seat 
gorbachev had just autographed a book for imprisoned former 
american indian movement leader leonard peltier whose case soviets 
often cite as an example of us human rights abuses 
as is his custom gorbachev opened the meeting with a lengthy 
statement representatives of at least 32 american groups and of 
peace organizations from many other countries then lined up at four 
microphones spread around the hall to make statements

a tense 27hour blockade by mohawk 
indians from a reservation near montreal has ended peacefully after 
indian leaders met with officials in ottawa to air their grievances 
mohawk leaders warned however that the barricades erected 
wednesday after police raids to stem the illegal trade of 
cigarettes might reappear 
mohawk indian late thursday cleared roadblocks set up across 
highway 132 and mercier bridge which connects montreal with 
suburbs on the south shore of the st lawrence river 
the blockades went up after 200 police officers raided the 
reserve and arrested 17 people for selling cigarettes smuggled from 
the united states 
after the raid mohawks with rifles slung over their shoulders 
parked an 18wheel truck across the highway and dumped gravel on 
the road closing the major artery and bridge and causing chaos for 
commuters 
the standoff continued until late thursday reporters at mercier 
bridge said the indians set up what looked like a machine gun 
late thursday earl karoniakta a spokesman for the mohawk 
warrior society said the mercier bridge will remain clear as 
long as were not being jerked around as long as our people are 
being treated like human beings 
in ottawa a mohawk delegate to the meeting with canadian 
officials stormed out an hour after it started calling the session 
pointless 
quite clearly the talks were not too productive or 
successful said joe norton mohawk grand chief after emerging 
from the meeting 
norton said the mohawks failed to gain a guarantee from the 
royal canadian mounted police that there wouldnt be further raids 
acting police commissioner hank jensen said after the meeting 
the raids were the result of a long investigation part of a 
laborious task that you dont launch overnight and the force will 
do it again when there are flagrant abuses of the law 
the mounties carried out the raid using search warrants and said 
they seized 450000 worth of cigarettes bought dutyfree in the 
united states 
police said the 17 people arrested would probably be charged 
with smuggling 
canada exempts indians from taxation but only for goods sold to 
indians the mohawks have been importing taxfree cigarettes from 
the united states and reselling them to nonindians a carton that 
would sell for 20 if taxed goes for about 1450 
customs officials estimate the illegal cigarette trade is worth 
16 million a year at two reservations alone kahnawake and the 
akwesasne reserve straddling the border between cornwall ontario 
and massena ny 
the raid and blockade came less than 24 hours after georges 
erasmus national chief of the assembly of first nations issued a 
warning that frustration with the federal governments inaction on 
indian concerns could lead to violence 
canadas 387000 indians have pressed the government for three 
years to negotiate constitutional guarantees on indian selfrule

former us intelligence analyst samuel loring 
morison will be allowed to stay out of prison at least temporarily 
while he appeals his conviction for espionage and theft to the 
supreme court 
morison had been scheduled to go to prison today for giving 
secret satellite photographs of a soviet ship to a british 
magazine but us district judge joseph young in baltimore issued 
a stay of imprisonment thursday until june 15 said morison 
attorney steven f reich and supreme court officials 
earlier thursday supreme court chief justice william h 
rehnquist denied morisons emergency request asking that he be 
allowed to remain free pending a formal appeal to the full court 
because morison has not shown that his appeal is likely to 
result in reversal with respect to all the counts for which 
imprisonment was imposed his application is denied rehnquist 
said 
rehnquist said that even if there is a substantial question 
about the propriety of morisons espionage conviction morison 
failed to raise a substantial question with respect to his 
conviction for theft of government property 
when rehnquist denied morisons appeal morison made a similar 
petition to justice william j brennan who referred morisons 
request to the full court said supreme court spokeswoman kathy 
arberg 
the solicitor generals office then agreed that morisons 
imprisonment should be delayed and judge young issued the stay of 
imprisonment the high court is expected to consider morisons 
request on june 9 supreme court officials said 
rehnquist has authority over emergency requests from the 4th 
us judicial circuit where morison was convicted 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals based in richmond va 
upheld the conviction in april rejecting morisons arguments that 
congress intended laws against spying to protect against the 
distribution of classified material to a foreign government rather 
than leaks to the press 
morison grandson of the late pulitzer prizewinning historian 
samuel eliot morison was convicted in october 1985 of giving to 
janes defence weekly photographs taken by a us spy satellite of 
a soviet nuclear aircraft carrier under construction 
morison who worked as a civilian for the navy also was 
convicted of the theft of the photos and government documents 
describing a may 1984 explosion at the soviet unions severomorsk 
naval base 
he was sentenced to two years in prison but remained free on 
100000 bond pending appeal 
prosecutors said morisons actions endangered national security 
because the photos revealed how a us spy satellite worked they 
also said he leaked the photos to get a fulltime job with janes 
after doing parttime work for the military journal while employed 
by the navy 
defense attorneys contended morison was trying to educate the 
public about a soviet naval buildup and that the photos told the 
soviets nothing they had not learned already from a 1978 incident 
in which the spy satellites operations manual was sold to a soviet 
agent 
the case is morison vs us a876

a powerful secondgeneration 
antiaids drug could be available within a decade say scientists 
who helped identify the precise target where the aids virus latches 
onto cells it destroys 
the study by scientists at the california institute of 
technology here ortho pharmaceuticals in raritan nj and the 
university of alabama birmingham was published today in the 
journal science 
the studys chief authors caltech molecular biologist bradford 
jameson and protein chemist stephen bh kent discouraged excess 
optimism that their discovery would lead to a drug to treat or cure 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome which cripples the bodys 
diseasefighting immune system 
we do not want to give people false hope said kent 
nonetheless he said a drug more effective than those now being 
developed could be available in 10 years 
however dr mathilde krim a founder of the american foundation 
for aids research said kent was exaggerating the time it would 
take to develop a drug using the new discovery 
if things go very well id say two years until it would be 
made available to people krim whose organization funded the 
120000 study said by phone from new york city 
to my knowledge it is the first time a binding site has been 
identified with such precision for any virus krim said its a 
wonderful accomplishment 
scientists previously knew the aids virus infects t4 white blood 
cells and certain other cells by attaching to cd4 a receptor 
protein on the cells surface t4 cells are the main immunesystem 
cells destroyed by aids 
using sophisticated analyses jameson identified the exact part 
of the cd4 protein to which the aids virus attaches known as a 
binding site 
in the next step crude synthetic copies of the binding site 
were manufactured by jameson kent and caltech biology chairman 
leroy hood 
alabama scientists found that in the test tube the fake binding 
sites acted as decoys to overwhelm aids virus particles so they 
couldnt latch onto real binding sites on t4 cells 
if scientists can create more sophisticated versions of the fake 
binding site those might work as a drug to treat or cure aids or 
to carry viruskilling drugs to the aids virus kent said 
this is the first step toward a secondgeneration drug he 
said 
the finding should provide information that will guide future 
efforts to develop agents capable of blocking the virus agreed 
dan capon a molecular biologist at genentech inc a south san 
francisco company using a similar approach to develop antiaids 
drugs 
kent and jameson said their findings are important in learning 
how viruses infect cells and might be use to create drugs to fight 
other viruses and treat rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune 
diseases in which the body is attacked by its own immune system 
such drugs could also prevent the immune system from rejecting 
transplanted organs 
a major obstacle is that either fake cd4 proteins or fake 
binding sites might also prevent the immune system from doing its 
job kent said 
however krim said that risk should be much lower if fake 
binding sites rather than fake cd4 proteins are used in a drug and 
that such risk would be acceptable in treating severely ill aids 
patients

the suzuki samurai is so unstable it literally 
trips over its own feet and rolls over says the publisher of 
consumer reports which gave the popular sport vehicle its first 
not acceptable rating in 10 years 
but the american suzuki motor corp defended the japanesebuilt 
samurai as safe and said there was no justification for the 
magazine publishers claim that it should be banned because it 
tends to turn over in sudden turns 
consumers union publisher of consumer reports said thursday 
the samurai is too short too narrow too light and has too high a 
center of gravity to be safe it asked federal regulators to recall 
the more than 150000 samurais sold in this country and provide 
refunds to owners 
consumers union called the fourwheeldrive sport utility 
vehicle wholly unsuitable for consumer use in a petition filed 
with the national highway traffic safety administration 
that car literally trips over its own feet and i wouldnt 
want to be in it said r david pittle technical director of 
consumers union at a news conference theyre promoted as safe 
fun vehicles when the fact of the matter is theyre not 
consumers union said the 8500 samurai was the first car out of 
349 tested in the last decade to roll over during a routine 
accidentavoidance test in which cars are made to swerve to avoid 
an obstacle in the road 
consumers union officials showed a videotape in which the 
samurai lurched onto two wheels and began to roll over when it 
suddenly changed lanes at just under 40 mph armlike extensions 
installed to protect the test drivers prevented the car from 
rolling onto its side 
the samurais major competitors the jeep wrangler the jeep 
cherokee and the isuzu trooper were shown making the same maneuver 
without losing stability at speeds higher than 40 mph 
it was 10 years ago that consumer reports labeled the dodge 
omniplymouth horizon models not acceptable saying they had a 
dangerous steering problem the problem was corrected the next 
model year the magazine said 
we were thinking of turning it over to our older son now we 
wont do that said edward taylor 41 of cleveland heights 
ohio who owns a convertible samurai 
youre driving down the road at 65 mph and a cat or dog jumps 
out in front of you you have to find out how good a driver you 
are its something im not looking forward to he said 
doug mazza vice president and general manager of american 
suzuki said we have absolute confidence that we are selling a 
safe and stable vehicle 
the company said the samurai was thoroughly tested for safety 
stability and handling before it was introduced in the united 
states in november 1985 suzuki sold 154675 of them through april 
we are not surprised that professional drivers can cause the 
samurai or other motor vehicles to roll over mazza said but 
the real results of the samurai safety is proven on american roads 
every day 
the petition from consumers union asked that the government 
require similar vehicles to pass driving tests rather than just 
meet design standards 
the center for auto safety filed a similar petition in february 
citing the samurais rollover problem the center said the samurai 
had been involved in at least 32 rollover accidents resulting in 
eight deaths and 35 injuries 
the national highway traffic safety administration said there 
have been 44 reported incidents of samurais rolling over involving 
53 injuries and 16 deaths a spokesman for the agency ron defore 
would not comment on the consumers union petition the agency has 
120 days to respond 
the company says police found serious driver error in all of the 
fatal accidents 
defore said he could not comment on whether the suzuki has a 
higher rollover rate than its competitors he said utility vehicles 
in general have a fatality rate that is three times that of 
lightduty vehicles such as small pickups and that rollovers 
account for twothirds of the fatalities in utility vehicles 
defore said drivers of utility vehicles tend to be younger and 
more adventurous than the average driver and are more prone to 
accidents 
details of the tests are in a report to be published in the july 
issue of consumer reports

president mohammad zia ulhaqs 
pledge to hold elections in 90 days initially filled many 
pakistanis with hope although he had just fired his prime minister 
and the entire national assembly 
now doubt is returning 
many observers of this nations byzantine political machinery 
are growing skeptical that those elections will take place as 
promised the disappointment could eventually help galvanize 
opponents of zia who has dominated this country for more than 10 
years 
the 64yearold general who also holds the powerful post of 
army chief of staff dismissed civilian prime minister mohammad 
khan junejo his 33man cabinet and the 237member assembly on 
sunday 
he accused the cabinet and lawmakers of corruption inability to 
enforce islamic laws and failure to control lawlessness that 
culminated in bloody ethnic and regional rioting 
his pledge to hold new elections in 90 days conforms to the 
nations constitution junejo and all opposition parties are 
demanding that the elections be held on time and that they be free 
and impartial 
however the past few days have given rise to growing doubt in 
many quarters about zias electoral promise 
there is a growing depression over the possibility of zia 
holding elections within 90 days said a western diplomat who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
over the last four days the diplomatic community is 
developing a concern for a vacuum of national assembly in the 
forseeable future not of early elections the diplomat said 
many people who have met zia over the last four days including 
senior diplomats reported that the president appeared to enjoy his 
return to total authority many are concerned the zia plans to stay 
in complete control 
zia seized power on july 5 1977 by toppling prime minister 
zulfikar ali bhutto who was later executed he imposed martial law 
and ruled the country singlehandedly until march 23 1985 when he 
picked junejo as prime minister 
however the arrangement came to an abrupt end sunday in the 
wake of their growing differences over defense foreign affairs 
and domestic politics 
in his public criticism after the dismissals zia laid great 
weight on the governments alleged failure to promote islamic law 
however he made no mention of such a failure tuesday while 
addressing diplomats in islamabad said one participant speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
his stress on islam in his public speeches may have been to 
cater to domestic lobbies only said the diplomat speaking on 
condition of anonymity the powersharing between an armybased 
president and a civilian prime minister which zia himself 
introduced in 1985 seems to be ending at least between now and 
the next election 
a caretaker government which zia has not yet named will remain 
without a prime minister that arrangement will amount to tilting 
back to a presidential form of government giving zia all the power 
once again

i thank the lord that its over for me but i still babysit every 
morning 
the holmes family will fill an entire section at the ceremony 
only one child cannot attend donald an army sergeant stationed in 
germany 
one of the most striking things about the holmes family is 
that all of the children have been polite wellbehaved 
individuals said william g stubbs the high schools principal 
none has ever gotten into serious trouble in school 
i wish mr and mrs holmes would market their formula for 
raising children he said 
like many mothers mrs holmes predicts she will be wiping tears 
from her eyes at the june 22 ceremony but after seeing the 
children through school her husband said he will be cheering 
im so glad its over he said referring to the graduations 
of his two youngest children 18yearold herbert and 17yearold 
frances maybe now she mrs holmes and i can have some time to 
ourselves said the 63yearold retired maintenance man 
mrs holmes is a bit more sentimental and pointed out that her 
36 grannies are constantly at the house anyway wayne young 
17 is only the first grandchild to graduate from high school 
mrs holmes admitted that over the years her children sometimes 
thought she was too strict when dining out for instance she 
never let them ask for seconds because people would think that 
with so many of us they were all starving to death but when they 
started having their own children they began to know what i was 
doing 
despite her happy memories mrs holmes said she does not want 
her children to have so many of their own one son already has six 
children and i hope he doesnt have any more she said 
they all have good jobs that they shouldnt give up mrs 
holmes said 
sally jordan a teacher who recalls most of the holmes family 
said theyve been an exceptional group of kids 
one time ms jordan had three of the holmes daughters on the 
field hockey team she coached 
they let me know that their mother made a chart and they had 
chores to do and theyd just have to work field hockey around it 
she said 
i think its a tribute to fine parents ms jordan said 
their parents expected a lot of them and cooperated with the 
school system ive often used them as great examples of the way

lawmakers rejected an attempt to call an 
early presidential election and allowed president jose sarney to 
complete a fiveyear term ending in 1990 even though polls 
indicated that voters want elections now 
the congress sitting as a constituent assembly to rewrite the 
constitution on thursday voted 328 in favor of a fiveyear term 
and 222 in favor of four years 
leftist lawmakers wanted the election in november this year but 
the assembly decided the countrys estimated 75 million eligible 
voters will go to the polls in november 1989 brazilians have not 
voted for a president since 1960 
the voting which began after nine hours of debate was 
interrupted repeatedly by shouts of elections now and sarney 
out after the vote legislators unveiled a huge sign that read 
five years betrayal of the people 
polls taken over the past year consistently have shown a 
majority of brazils 143 million people want presidential elections 
this year 
the fiveyear term is subject to a final vote but political 
analysts say it will pass when the entire constitution is voted 
chapter by chapter later this year 
the issue has been one of the most heated of the constituent 
assembly which already has approved the fiveyear term for future 
presidents the current constitution gives presidents a sixyear 
mandate 
lawmakers elected in 1986 have been spending the last 14 months 
writing a new constitution to replace the one handed down by a 
military junta in 1969 
sarney 57 took office in 1985 as the running mate of tancredo 
neves who died before taking office neves was a civilian selected 
in an electoral college vote to pave the way for nonmilitary rule 
the military government had ruled since a 1964 coup 
sarney who was leader of the militarybacked social democratic 
party before taking office has often alluded to a military threat 
if the assembly shortened his term sarney still counts the 
military chiefs among his closest supporters 
my duty is to leave the nation institutionalized and not allow 
the climate of freedom and consolidation to turn into a prague 
spring sarney said in a recent interview with the respected 
daily gazeta mercantil newspaper 
sarney was referring to the popular protests demanding 
democratic reforms in czechoslovakia 20 years ago that were crushed 
by soviet troops 
sarney has maintained that uncertainty over his term has kept 
him from properly running the country deprived him of a strong 
political base and is a reason for brazils economic problems 
critics charge sarney has only been concerned with his term 
allowing inflation to soar to a projected annual rate of 600 
percent and investment to drop to almost zero

georgias drought is gripping farmers and 
citydwellers alike and officials compare it with some of the 
states worst dry spells 
all crops and pastures are in a stressful situation if rain 
doesnt come soon theres a chance well be losing the crops 
jerry midden agricultural statistician for the georgia crop 
reporting service said thursday 
row crops such as peanuts soybeans and corn are in serious 
trouble midden said theyre sitting in the dry soil and 
withering away 
there was a chance of thundershowers today and early next week 
but the rain was not expected to provide significant relief the 
national weather service said 
for the fourth week in a row the georgia crop report showed 
more than half of the states soil had less than adequate moisture 
in the atlanta area local governments tightened water use 
restrictions already in place 
this has got to be treated as a major drought on a par with 
the 50s the 30s and three other major droughts dating back to 
the 1840s said state climatologist gayther plummer 
california is suffering a milder drought in a meeting thursday 
officials reported general success in reducing water use last month 
in the san francisco bay area san jose and santa clara and marin 
counties in northern california rationing reduced water 
consumption by 22 percent in san francisco said matt mullen of the 
city water department 
in georgia the northern section of the state is in the worst 
shape running 50 percent of normal rainfall for the first four 
months of 1988 plummer said the state usually averages 50 inches 
of rainfall annually but has had only 120 inches in most areas 
over the past five years like almost one year of rainfall 
missing plummer said 
the latest crop report showed 30 percent of georgias soil had 
adequate moisture 52 percent was short and 18 percent very short 
and thats the fourth consecutive week for those figures its 
the lowest rating of the season midden said 
because of dry pastures agriculture commissioner tommy irvin 
has gotten permission for farmers to graze livestock on land set 
aside under the food security act of 1985 that normally must lie 
fallow 
without the additional feed farmers could be forced to sell 
off their herd leading to a shortage of cows later this year 
irvin said wednesday 
the atlanta area is also short of water the region is 54 
inches or 23 percent short on water for the year according to 
the weather service 
on thursday lake lanier the areas main water source was 2 
feet below its lowest point during the 1986 drought and just 10 
feet above the record low of dec 24 1981 
water use restrictions were tightened this week in the two 
counties that contain atlanta and many suburbs 
the water consumption was going up instead of going down 
said gus monroe deputy director of the dekalb water and sewer 
division we have to do something to slow down water 
consumption 
the city of atlanta has banned outdoor watering from 7 am to 
11 am since november

suspected sinhalese extremists today 
killed two candidates in sri lankas southern province and burnt 
government buildings a day after they attempted to disrupt voting 
in two other provinces 
a police officer in colombo said one victim belonged to the 
governing united national party and the other to a communist 
alliance 
the officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said he had no 
further details on the killings 
at least 75 cases of arson in the southern province which 
electes members to local government councils on june 9 were 
reported he said the targets were government buildings and 
electricity and telephone posts he said 
the violence erupted hours after officials announced results of 
elections held on thursday in the western and central provinces 
the united national party won 87 of the 158 seats at stake while 
a threeparty communist alliance won 60 seats the sri lanka moslem 
congress clinched nine seats and two members of the liberal party 
were also elected the election department announced

liberation front an extremist sinhalese group 
at least six people including two policemen were killed on 
wednesday and thursday as the front launched a wave of arson and 
bombings in an attempt to disrupt voting 
members of the front burnt 15 government buildings two trains 
and at least six buses in the western and central provinces where 
polling was held officials said 
on thursday polling booths were attacked by sinhalese radicals 
with bombs and grenades police officers in colombo said the 
officers spoke on condition of anonymity 
the front opposes the plan to elect provincial councils in the 
nine provinces in the country saying it gives too many 
concessisons to tamils 
the plan is aimed at giving the minority tamil community which 
makes up a majority of the population in the northern and eastern 
provinces more say in local government to quell their fiveyear 
separtist war 
four of the countrys provinces went to the polls on april 28 in 
elections that were also won by the united national party 
the southern province is to elect council members next week but 
polls in the northern and eastern provinces have been posponed 
indefinitely because tamil rebels have renounced the peace plan and 
are continuing their violent agitation for an independent homeland 
tamils form 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people the 
rebels claim that their community is discriminated against by the 
sinhalese who comprise 75 percent of the population and control 
the government and military 
thursdays polls were also marked by opposition allegations of 
rigging rajiva wijesiwha president of the liberal party said 
members of the governing party impersonated voters after driving 
opposition representatives out of polling booths

were being investigated he said 15 million of the 36 million 
eligible voters participated in the polls 
the turnout is considered low when compared to past elections

brother to death in an argument over a bicycle state police said 
freddy partin of williamstown was charged with seconddegree 
manslaughter wednesday in the death of his brother timothy the 
boys had been quarreling over who would ride their bicycle when the 
shooting occurred police said 
police said freddy rode the bike to a nearby service station 
after the shooting wednesday borrowed a quarter from the cashier 
and called his mother nannie jane partin to tell her what 
happened 
theres no rhyme or reason here said state police trooper 
jim dolwick one brother winds up killing the other over 
something as trivial as a bicycle how do you explain that 
the two boys were at home alone in the living room of the small 
frame house rented by their mother when the shooting occurred 
police said it was not immediately clear who owned the gun 
both boys attended williamstown elementary school where classes 
ended two weeks ago for the summer 
janis fox supervisor of instruction for the williamstown 
schools said ms partin who is a single parent and employed at a 
fastfood restaurant worked a lot and im sure the boys were 
left alone a lot because of that 
she said neither of the younger brothers was a discipline 
problem in school but freddy is a child who had to learn to 
control his temper 
freddy was charged as a juvenile and grant county attorney jim 
purcell said the maximum sentence he could receive would be to be 
placed in the care of the kentucky cabinet for human resources 
until he is 18 
the boy was released to the custody of his uncle richard partin

a genetically altered carp that grows 20 
percent faster than natural carp could reduce fish prices and boost 
fishing industry revenues a researcher says 
however a critic of genetic engineering warned that havoc could 
result if altered carp escape into lakes and streams and upset 
natures balance 
two researchers from johns hopkins university here and one from 
auburn university in alabama injected the genes of rainbow trout 
into carp eggs to create a fish that grows onefifth faster than 
other carp and consumes more food 
the potential of doing this in other fish could mean billions 
of dollars worldwide if you can get organisms to grow faster and 
improve efficiency it will bring down the price to the consumer 
said one of the researchers johns hopkins biology department 
chairman dennis powers 
the technique could eventually be applied to catfish farming a 
multimilliondollarayear industry for the south powers said in 
addition if continuing tests on the altered carp succeed genetic 
manipulation could increase fish production in winter months when 
fish grow more slowly 
but genetic engineering critic jeremy rifkin said that if the 
carp escapes into nature that could dramatically change and 
disrupt marine life 
if the altered genes are transmitted to other generations they 
could overtake the environment said rikfin a washingtonbased 
lobbyist who is president of the foundation on economic trends 
powers however said that because the fish need substantially 
more food than normal carp they would likely starve if released 
into the environment rather than being raised at a fish farm 
powers also said he and his colleagues have to study whether the 
altered gene can be passed on to future generations of carp 
powers johns hopkins molecular biologist thomas chen and auburn 
fisheries geneticist rex dunham have asked the us department of 
agriculture for permission to release the carp into small 
experimental ponds at auburn to see how the fish fare outdoors 
the fish would be isolated in the holding ponds and would not 
be allowed to escape into lakes and streams in the preliminary 
study powers said 
rifkin said there were not enough assurances the carp would not 
escape and is petitioning usda to deny the application 
the researchers injected a growth hormoneproducing gene into 
the justfertilized eggs of 10000 carp but only 20 carp retained 
the trout gene 
because of that dunham said more experiments would have to be 
done before he is sure the experiment succeeded 
chinese scientists proved last year that genes from other 
animals can change physical and chemical processes in fish 
scientists have successfully mixed genes from different species 
in warmblooded animals such as rodents and livestock and in 
microbes and plants

somali rebels have warned the 
united states and other foreign governments against trying to 
evacuate about 160 foreigners trapped by somalias civil war 
however the antigovernment guerrillas said they would agree to 
a unsponsored removal of the foreigners who were in parts of 
northern somalia that apparently fell into rebel hands earlier this 
week 
the foreigners mostly aid workers include americans britons 
and french 
the british foreign office said about 25 britons were there and 
that they were not considered in immediate danger 
there were reports thursday that the united states and britain 
intended to remove their nationals none of the africabased 
diplomats for both countries contacted by the associated press 
verified those reports 
saeed yusuf a rebel spokesman in addis ababa said thursday his 
guerrilla movement would cooperate only with an evacuation 
organized by the united nations 
we reject and warn against any form of intervention against 
this just war of liberation yusuf said we are worried that 
this might be an excuse to turn the evacuation into a kind of 
intervention our troops would have no choice but to stand against 
them 
the united states is somalias most important ally and britain 
was the former colonial ruler in northern somalia 
the rebels claimed they captured the main northern town of 
hargeisa on tuesday after a ninehour battle however the british 
foreign office said somali government officials denied the claim 
government officials could not be reached for comment today 
yusuf said government troops were trying to regain the town 
the rebels said they took berbera somalias main seaport and 
the site of a us navy construction unit on wednesday 
yusuf said the rebels controlled most of the countryside in the 
north and a cluster of small towns in the center of the region 
he said the foreigners in those areas were safe in their homes 
any danger is from the side of the government troops who are 
engaged in the shelling of towns won by the snm rebels he said

insulindependent diabetics sustained by kidney 
transplants for 10 years or more have a fair chance of being free 
of complications normally associated with the disease surgeons say 
the paper by surgeons at the university of minnesota was to be 
presented today at the american society of transplant surgeons 
annual meeting 
doctors elsewhere said they have succeeded in simultaneously 
transplanting tiny kidneys and pancreata from children into 
diabetic adults holding out hope to some of the many diabetics 
unable to be cured because of the scarcity of donor organs 
its very very important to use all potential donors and 
help as many diabetics as possible said dr dai d nghiem a 
transplant surgeon at allegheny general hospital in pittsburgh 
according to the american diabetes association more than 11 
million americans suffer from diabetes a disease caused by the 
bodys inability to produce or properly use insulin insulin a 
hormone produced by the pancreas is needed to convert sugar 
starches and other food into energy 
an estimated 1 million people have the more severe form of the 
disease and must take daily insulin injections to stay alive 
complications include heart and kidney disease blindness nerve 
damage and gangrene that requires limb amputation 
of the 264 insulindependent diabetics who underwent kidney 
transplants at the university of minnesota more than 10 years ago 
100 were alive a decade after the operation said one researcher 
dr john najarian 
a third of the 100 longterm survivors had no diabetesrelated 
complications and amputations were necessary in only 20 percent 
the longterm patients eyesight and nerve disorders stabilized 
in a majority of cases according to najarian 
kidney disease present in the transplanted kidney tissue of all 
patients progressed in just half of those who survived a decade 
he said 
of the 13000 people currently awaiting kidney transplants in 
the united states about a third are diabetics with kidney failure 
najarian said a transplant would get them off dialysis but they 
still would need insulin shots 
some diabetics with kidney failure opt for a pancreas as well as 
kidney transplant so they can be free of both insulin and dialysis 
about 150 people all of them diabetic currently are awaiting 
pancreas transplants across the country according to the united 
network for organ sharing 
to help ease the crunch nghiem and other surgeons at the 
university of iowa performed seven kidneypancreas transplants from 
1984 to 1986 on diabetic adults with organs from children as young 
as 4 the double transplant had never been done before with child 
organs he said 
seventeen similar transplants were performed with adultsize 
organs during the twoyear period 
one of the patients who received adult organs and one who 
received child organs died of diabetesrelated complications 
nghiem said thursday 
nghiem whos since moved to pittsburgh said the use of 
childsize organs can help reduce the number of diabetic adults 
awaiting transplants doctors however say the impact may be 
minimal because so few children qualify as organ donors

a majority of us physicians responding to a 
survey say they favor strongly withdrawing lifesupport systems 
from hopelessly ill or irreversibly comatose patients and most say 
they have faced such situations 
withdrawing treatment sounds harsh but it can be a a 
benevolent act said dr kenneth vaux a professor of ethics at 
the university of illinois medical school in chicago 
the survey conducted by the american medical association and 
published today asked doctors would you favor or oppose 
withdrawing lifesupport systems including food and water from 
hopelessly ill or irreversibly comatose patients if they or their 
families request it 
fiftyeight percent of those surveyed answered favor 
strongly 20 percent favor 5 percent oppose 10 percent 
oppose strongly and 7 percent unsure 
one thousand randomly selected physicians in various specialties 
responded to the survey which was published in the ama weekly 
american medical news 
of those physicians 67 percent said they have been directly 
involved in treating a patient where the issue of refusing or 
withdrawing lifesustaining treatment arose 
while physicians should never directly cause death they must 
always act in the best interest of their patients and that 
sometimes includes allowing them to die said dr james h 
sammons executive vice president of the chicagobased ama 
dr james childress a medical ethics professor at the 
university of virginia said he perceived a shift toward 
considering cost when deciding whether to continue lifesustaining 
treatment 
during the time of the karen ann quinlan case in the 
mid1970s there was a greater risk of overtreatment but now with 
pressures of cost containment patients may be in danger of 
undertreatment childress said in a telephone interview wednesday 
added vaux the danger is well start to do people in before 
theyre ready to die 
in the case of miss quinlan who became comatose in 1975 the 
new jersey supreme court affirmed the individuals right to die 
with dignity and permitted authorities to remove a respirator in 
1976 she died in 1985 
the survey also showed 54 percent of the physicians were 
uncertain of the legal risks and responsibilities surrounding a 
decision to withdraw lifesustaining treatment while 43 percent 
said they were certain 
ninety percent said doctors should initiate discussions with 
patients or families on the use or withdrawal of lifesupport 
treatment while 7 percent said they should not 
no margin of error was given for the survey 
vaux said the survey implies doctors are returning to a more 
ancient attitude of accompanying the person to the death 
being willing to withdraw life support when the patient asks 
for it or when no further medical remedies exist thats an 
expression of fidelity to a patient he said 
still physicians must not always follow a patients request 
said dr nancy dickey a member of the amas council on ethical and 
judicial affairs 
if medical science can correct the basic problem so that the 
patient returns to a good quality of life then it might be 
inappropriate for a physician to listen to a patient who is asking 
him to do nothing she said 
in a separate survey in february the ama polled 1500 people 
selected at random from telephone listings 
fiftysix percent said they had told family members their wishes 
concerning the use of lifesustaining treatment if they entered a 
irreversible coma just 15 percent said they had filled out a 
living will specifying those wishes 
the physicians surveyed also in february were selected 
randomly from the amas files of all active us doctors they 
included ama members and nonmembers and physicians of both sexes 
and various ages

thousands of radical students shouting 
antiamerican slogans vowed today to march to north korea next week 
to force reunification of the divided korean peninsula 
student leaders at a rally said they would lead the march to the 
border truce site of panmunjom on june 10 to meet with north korean 
students and work to reunify with the communist north 
lets go and meet the northern people after driving out all 
foreign forces a speaker said as students cheered and clapped 
speakers repeatedly denounced the united states claiming that 
washington enforces the partition of the korean peninsula and rules 
the south as a colony the campus was adorned with giant pictures 
of students destroying us flags and routing us troops 
yankee go home and go to panmunjom the 3000 students 
from various colleges shouted in the rally at kyonghee university 
south korean authorities have warned that the students will not 
be allowed to march to the border the border is heavily 
militarized and offlimits to civilians 
about 50 students hurling firebombs and shouting antiamerican 
slogans clashed very briefly with riot police at dankook university 
in seoul before being driven back by tear gas but the country was 
reported quiet today with peaceful demonstrations on most campuses 
the south korean government announced earlier today that it 
wanted to open new highlevel talks with north korea on the olympic 
games and other issues dividing the two nations 
south korean prime minister lee hyunjae made the proposal in a 
letter addressed to his north korean counterpart lee gun mo the 
letter was read by information minister chung hanmo on radio 
in other developments japanese officials said the united states 
has asked the soviet union to urge north korea to exercise 
restraint during the olympic games this september 
and authorities at seouls kimpo international aiport and korean 
air were on the lookout today for four alleged japanese radicals 
following a tipoff from american law enforcement officials 
in the letter lee said south korea wanted to talk to north 
korea to speedily dispel the mistrust that is now standing in the 
way of peaceful unification 
but south korean officials said north korea refused to accept 
lees letter 
radical students have been demanding immediate reunfication of 
the two koreas student leaders say they want north korean students 
to march to meet them june 10 and destroy the border 
the radicals contend the united states is reponsible for the 
partition of the peninsula since 1945 they have been demanding 
withdrawal of the 42000 us troops based in south korea 
south korea has been hit by a wave of violent antigovernment 
and antius protests during the past three weeks with radical 
students fighting riot police in seoul and other cities 
most south koreans oppose the communist north under the oneman 
rule of kim il sung and fear any moves by the north to take over 
the south the north invaded the south in 1950 sparking the korean 
war 
most south koreans are thought to support the us military 
presence as a defense against the north 
but reunification is an emotional issue for all koreans and has 
been increasingly debated in recent months reunification tended to 
be a taboo subject in the south under past authoritarian 
governments but president roh taewoo has lifted most restrictions 
on discussion 
in tokyo meanwhile japanese defense officials said the united 
states had asked the soviet union to urge north korea to exercise 
restraint during the olympics 
japanese defense officials learned of the request from us 
secretary of defense frank c carlucci who arrived in japan for a 
visit after attending the superpower summit in moscow 
korean air officials said the fbi told kals office in new york 
on thursday that four men linked to an alleged japanese red army 
member being held in new york might try to slip into south korea to 
sabotage the games 
they said the names of the four men were obtained by the fbi 
while interrogating yu kikumura 35 who was arrested april 13 in 
new jersey after police reportedly found three bombs in his car 
the revolutionary japanese group is suspected of links with 
communist north korea south korea fears the north may stage 
terrorist attacks to disrupt the games

griefstricken relatives today 
undertook the painful task of identifying loved ones among the 57 
miners killed in a huge gas explosion deep inside a coal mine an 
18yearold on his first day at work was among the dead 
wives of dead miners burst into tears as they watched bodies 
being retrieved from the coal shaft grave and taken in metal 
coffins to a temporary mortuary 
many of these people were very active in our community this 
catastrophe is an enormous loss for all of us said bernd 
hessler mayor of borken a town of 14000 people 70 miles 
northeast of frankfurt 
flags flew at halfstaff in front of borkens city hall 
rescue workers continued to remove the bodies from the mine 
today and officials said the 23rd body was brought up by 
midmorning officials said work was progressing slowly and could 
take several days 
crowds of grieving relatives were gathered at the site 
stop stop my god one woman shouted at news photographers 
taking pictures of the bodies being removed 
investigators said today they were learning more about what 
killed the victims 
several of those found had such great injuries that they could 
have died from those causes anyway even without the carbon 
monoxide said stefan walscher the local prosecutor leading the 
investigation 
investigators also said many of the miners suffocated some 
apparently died after their emergency breathing masks ran out of 
oxygen deep underground 
ernst wilke head of hesse states district of kassel told 
reporters the search is being continued in every corner of the 
mine 
workers were drilling two new emergency shafts to let more air 
into the mine to aid rescuers retrieving bodies 
fiftyseven miners were trapped 330 feet underground after 
wednesdays explosion and rescue workers say there is little hope 
any will be found alive 
grieving families boarded buses at the mine site and were driven 
to a school auditorium where the bodies were also taken 
among those killed in west germanys worst mining accident in 
more than 26 years was an 18yearold on his first day at work 
hed graduated from school last friday and wanted to earn some 
money before continuing his education hessler told reporters 
the mayor declined repeatedly to give the youths name out of 
respect for his parents wishes 
at least 14 of the men trapped were turkish immigrant workers 
a group of turkish women their heads covered with white shawls 
in the moslem sign of mourning broke into piercing wails outside 
the mine gate to show their grief thursday afternoon 
a local official from the social democratic party and the 
chairman of the local turkishgerman friendship society a turk 
were among the missing mayor hessler said 
about 300 turks live in borken 
a hesse state official said the cause of the blast had still not 
been determined but he rejected any contention that safety 
measures at the facility were inadequate 
this is one of the most modern and bestequipped lignite coal 
mines around said erwin braun head of the state mining board 
and it has been inspected many times including recently 
zdf television network said investigators were speculating that 
a shortcircuit from a tool may have started a chainreaction of 
explosions inside the gas and dustfilled mine 
braun said that possibility could not be discounted 
coal dust can become dangerous if it gets mixed with methane 
gas and there is suddenly a spark he said 
officials said that on a stillundetermined day next week there 
will be three religious services for the victims roman catholic 
lutheran and moslem 
turkish consulate representatives also were at the disaster 
scene on thursday 
the officials asking not to be identified by name said some of 
the turks will be taken back to their native country for burial 
in an interview on hesse state radio governor wallman promised 
that family members of the 14 turks killed in the accident will be 
allowed to stay in west germany if they choose to do so 
normally when an immigrant worker in west germany dies or loses 
his job the family must return home except in cases involving 
people from the european economic community 
about 170 people had been employed at the coal mine owned by 
preussen elektra of hanover one of the largest west german utility 
companies

acting prime minister poul schlueter 
was reported to be close to an agreement today on a new coalition 
government ending a sixweek political impasse that began with a 
dispute over denmarks links with nato 
schlueter was expected to present his minority cabinet to queen 
margrethe ii later today the conservative berlingske tidende 
newspaper said 
the cabinet would be made up of schlueters conservative party 
liberals and socialliberals 
the tripartite coalition would command 67 seats in the 
179member folketing parliament compared with the 70 mustered by 
the outgoing fourparty group that has governed denmark since 1982 
niels helveg petersen leader of the socialliberals said on 
danish radio that he had won crucial concessions on security 
policy during talks with schlueter and liberal leader uffe 
ellemannjensen 
petersens small centrist party which held the balance of power 
in the outgoing parliament helped topple schlueters minority 
government over the nuclear arms issue 
the folketing passed an oppositionsponsored resolution april 14 
calling on the government to remind visiting warships of denmarks 
longstanding peacetime ban on nuclear weapons 
following strong objections to the resolution by denmarks nato 
allies schlueter called a snap election for may 10 rather than 
implement the resolution 
the ballot was inclusive and a stalemate emerged between the 
eight parties which won seats 
the coalition agreement hammered out between schlueter petersen 
and ellemannjensen who is acting foreign minister was not made 
public 
in the new cabinet schlueter and ellemannjensen would retain 
their posts as would finance minister palle simonsen petersen 
would be appointed economic affairs minister berlingske tidende 
predicted 
the leftist opposition comprising social democrats and the 
socialist peoples party together have 79 seats 
the rarright progress party which made the biggest gains in 
the election has 16 seats but it was excluded from coalition 
talks because its antitax and antiimmigration policies are far 
outside denmarks mainstream politics 
in order to make room for the socialliberals schlueter shed 
the two junior partners from his previous coalition the nineseat 
center democrat and the fourseat christian peoples parties

president reagan gave japanese prime minister 
noboru takeshite a personal briefing today on the moscow summit 
another sign that usjapanese relations had improved despite 
longsimmering trade disputes 
reagan posing for pictures with takeshita was asked if trade 
was on the agenda for the meeting it could be he replied 
when reporters persisted in questioning reagan mostly about his 
summit with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev the president 
responded we have to go to work why dont you take the rest of 
the day off 
the two then went into winfield house the residence of the us 
ambassador for talks 
before leaving tokyo takeshita ruled out the possibility that 
contentious trade issues would come up during the discussion but 
on thursday reagan administration officials went out of there way 
to praise japan for the progress the country has made in opening up 
its markets and boosting domestic demand 
for more than two years the administration has been pressuring 
the japanese to adopt policies that will stimulate domestic demand 
instead of relying on exportled growth 
domestic demand has accelerated in japan this year helping to 
push the nations jobless rate down to 26 percent in april 
beryl sprinkel the presidents chief economic adviser said 
thursday that japan had done a remarkable job of modifying its 
economic policies in the past year 
i cant see how you could be unhappy with the very sharp 
acceleration in domestic demand i think everyone has been very 
pleasantly surprised at what has happened over there in the past 
year on that front he said in an interview with reporters 
sprinkel said the administration would continue to push for 
further progress by the japanese in opening their markets to 
foreign goods 
the important point is that the direction of change is highly 
favorable he said they have made major progress in 
deregulating their financial system but there are still some areas 
where we think further progress is needed 
us and japanese officials spent three days in washington this 
week locked in disagreement on one of those issues a prolonged 
dispute between the two countries over opening japanese markets to 
more imports of american beef and oranges 
the discussions between assistant us trade representative 
michael smith and japanese deputy agriculture minister hidero maki 
ended thursday with no agreement in sight the japanese are hoping 
to reach a settlement of the dispute before the toronto economic 
summit begins on june 19 but the american side is less certain the 
differences can be bridged by that time 
the united states has been demanding total removal of the beef 
and citrus import quotas that it had accepted in a 1984 agreement 
that expired in march 
part of reason for the easing of tensions between the two 
nations has been favorable news on the american trade deficit it 
fell to a threeyear low of 97 billion in march bolstering the 
presidents hand in his current fight with congress over the 
omnibus trade bill 
reagans veto of the measure is expected to be upheld by the 
senate an event that would be viewed favorably by the japanese 
who felt singled out by the measure one japanese politician 
branded it racially discriminatory 
the reason much of congress ire has been focused on japan is 
that the country has accounted for a large share of the deficit 
which hit a record 1712 billion last year over onethird of that 
amount 598 billion reflected the imbalance with japan 
but the dollars 50 percent depreciation versus the japanese yen 
appears to be making headway finally in lowering the deficit 
although analysts remain cautious in predicting major improvements 
david wyss economist with data resources inc said the us 
trade deficit would likely fall by about 10 percent this year to 
around 155 billion but he said much of that improvement would 
occur because of a pickup in sales to european countries not japan 
the problem is that to a large extent we just dont make the 
kinds of goods that the japanese want to buy and a lot of areas 
where we can compete such as agriculture are politically very 
sensitive within japan he said

mayor maureen oconnor is cruising to election 
day next week in a mayoral contest that the news media in the 
nations seventhlargest city have virtually ignored because even 
insiders find it dull 
to even say the race has been boring is too generous it 
hasnt been that exciting political consultant nick johnson 
said it seems like maureen oconnor is on a perpetual honeymoon 
and the rest of san diego is on the love boat 
oconnor who won the seat in a special 1986 race called after 
former mayor roger hedgecocks felony conviction has been an 
overwhelming favorite in tuesdays nonpartisan primary since the 
races outset 
she has waged a lowkey lowbudget campaign against city 
councilman floyd morrow and three minor candidates semiretired 
public relations official john kelley city hall gadfly rose lynne 
and businessman charles ulmschneider 
the race the citys fourth mayoral contest in five years has 
drawn only cursory attention from the citys 875000 residents and 
its news media 
radio ads have been scarce and television commercials rarer a 
series of debates that marked recent mayoral campaigns fell flat 
this year when oconnor refused to participate 
the candidates only major joint appearance will be a onehour 
debate to be broadcast on local television saturday night 
there wasnt a need for a lot of debates because weve all 
run for office before and the public already knows who we are and 
where we stand said oconnor the citys first female mayor 
this is kind of like a reunion 
by races end the candidates combined expenditures may barely 
top 100000 
oconnor had spent only 48839 by may 21 about 220000 less 
than she spent gaining the seat in 1986 in her unsuccessful 1983 
bid oconnor wife of robert o peterson founder of jack in the 
box restaurants spent 780000 and was accused of trying to buy 
the election 
oconnor 41 maintains that her somnolent campaign is in 
keeping with san diegans attitude toward the contest 
weve had so many mayors races lately that most people are 
just tired of it she said 
but morrow a 55yearold lawyer who finished third in the 1986 
race behind oconnor and city councilman bill cleator has accused 
oconnor of behaving like royalty not an elected official 
local government is supposed to be the level of government 
closest to the people but you couldnt prove that by maureen 
said morrow who says the mayor views the campaign more like a 
coronation than an election 
there are few differences between oconnor and morrow both 
democrats on most citywide issues 
recent polls indicated oconnor has a 21 lead over morrow she 
needs to win more than 50 percent of the vote to forgo a november 
runoff should she receive less the top two finishers will face 
each other in november 
oconnor says she has restored stability to city hall after 
hedgecocks forced resignation and other scandals enhanced the 
average citizens access to the mayors office and strengthened 
growthmanagement policies 
hedgecock was forced to resign from his fouryear term after he 
was convicted of perjury and conspiracy stemming from allegations 
that he plotted with political backers to illegally finance his 
1983 mayoral campaign

irans new acting commanderinchief 
today told iranians they must take the war with iraq more seriously 
following recent battle defeats 
addressing a moslem prayer congregation in tehran hashemi 
rafsanjani said there should be no compromise no submission and 
no backing down from our rights in the war the islamic republic 
news agency said 
we should take the situation more seriously rafsanjani told 
the worshipers 
iran has suffered two recent major defeats at the war front 
iraqi forces on april 18 retook the southern iraqi faw 
peninsula which had been captured by iran in february 1986 then 
on may 25 iraqi troops retook arge chunks of iraqi land east of 
basra 
the twin defeats for iran along with a series of naval clashes 
with the united states in midapril apparently have jolted the

being held improperly at oklahomas maximumsecurity prison and are 
forced to live in unsanitary conditions 
the suit filed by mail this week claims the inmates have been 
forced to wear nothing but their underwear since arriving at 
the oklahoma state penitentiary here 
shortly after the riot last month corrections officials said 
inmates believed to be directly involved in the uprising were being 
clothed only in underwear for security reasons spokesman jerry 
massie said thursday he was not certain if the inmates had been 
given clothes since 
the nine are being held at the mcalester prison with about 40 
inmates accused of involvement in the threeday riot at the 
mediumsecurity mack alford correctional center in stringtown

anything but underwear while being held in the special cells at the 
mcalester prison unit called the rock 
the unit was closed by a federal court order in the early 1980s 
but was reopened after the riot most of the inmates in the unit 
are accused of being the ringleaders or main participants in the 
uprising authorities said

not participate in the riot are housed in the east and west units 
at the state prison here which were reopened after courtordered

saying he wanted to encourage safe sex 
the parents of james a dowdy have filed a lawsuit seeking their 
sons reinstatement 
john h bothwell iii attorney for cindy and andy jablonsky 
filed the suit wednesday he said he reached a tentative agreement 
later that day with hillsborough county school board attorney w 
crosby few to drop the suit if school officials provide dowdy with 
study materials and set up an appointment with the parents

imposed last month in favor of some other punishment contending 
that james might have to repeat ninth grade if he is not allowed to 
return to adams junior high school to prepare for final exams

be irreparably harmed and would experience trauma 
embarrassment anguish and stigma the lawsuit said

board meeting and said principal ken adum incorrectly told the 
board the students had been warned not to disrupt the show 
bothwell said james was not among the students who received the 
admonishment

jablonskys was attached to the suit

an open letter by an iranian opposition politician 
that criticizes the policies of leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
has led to numerous arrests in iran according to reports reaching 
paris 
it was not immediately known if mehdi bazargan author of the 
letter and head of the tiny freedom movement irans only legal 
opposition group was among those in jail 
in the letter bazargan accused khomeini of following an 
erroneous policy in the war with iraq isolating iran and 
making it a symbol of hate around the world excerpts from the 
letter were printed in todays edition of le monde newspaper 
an iranian exile source in paris who obtained a copy of the 
letter said thursday it was 33 pages long and distributed in 
numerous iranian cities about 10 days ago 
another shorter letter by a group sympathizing with bazargan 
also was distributed in iran the source said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the letters and the subsequent arrests came on the heels of 
several major iranian defeats in its war with iraq in midapril 
iraq recaptured the faw peninsula from iran in late may iran lost 
its bridgehead in the southern iraqi port city of basra following 
an iraqi assault 
bazargan also denounced aid allegedly furnished by iran to 
terrorist groups such as the islamic jihad which claims to be 
holding western hostages in lebanon 
in truth for seven years iran and islam have become 
synonymous in the world with hate and malice le monde quoted the 
letter as saying it is a shame and not an honor 
when are you going to stop making commerce with the blood of 
our martyrs 
bazargan an opposition politician under former shah mohammed 
reza pahlavi was appointed prime minister shortly after khomeinis 
return from exile he stepped down in midnovember 1979 objecting 
to khomeinis support for the detention of american hostages 
bazargan also served in the nations parliament 
le monde said it appeared that several dozen people were 
arrested in tehran the iranian capital and provincial cities such 
as tabriz in azerbaijan and isfahan south of the capital 
among those arrested le monde said were ali ardalan former 
finance minister and husseini shah hussein who was president of 
the welcome committee when the exiled khomeini returned to iran in 
1980 
police forces this week occupied the tehran headquarters of the 
freedom movement making more arrests according to le monde which 
did not give sources for the report it said they were apparently 
searching for bazargan but did not say whether he was among those 
arrested 
yesterday at 2 am they went to his place but we dont know 
yet if he was arrested or not said abolhassan banisadr exiled 
first president of the postshah islamic republic in a telephone 
interview on thursday banisadr now lives outside paris 
in the letter le monde quoted bazargan as saying that none of 
irans war goals had been achieved and that iraqi president saddam 
hussein whom iran has vowed to topple remains in place 
you have besides proclaimed the continuation of the war 
until the destruction of israel but you have arrived at a policy 
of compromise and collaboration with israel an apparent 
reference to the irancontra imbroglio in which israel reportedly 
acted as a conduit for us arms sales to iran 
you have denounced the policies of the united states and now 
the latter are solidly installed at our door in the persian gulf 
you spoke of the failure of iraq and the bursting of its regime 
but with your erroneous policy iraq has reinforced itself and 
it is we who are on the edge of bankruptcy 
bazargan has in the past called for an end to the iraniraq war 
now in its eighth year but observers described the letter as his 
strongest such protest 
for the first time he denounced alleged iranian ties to 
terrorist groups naming the islamic jihad he wrote that by its 
terrorist action it has filled the world with hate toward our 
country 
you have thus isolated the islamic republic and the youth who 
made our revolution are today traumatized repressed and 
desperate 
on thursday khomeini appointed parliament speaker hashemi 
rafsanjani acting commanderinchief of irans armed forces irans 
official media reported 
banisadr said rafsanjani was appointed because the iranian 
goverment fears it may lose the war

palestinian protesters virtually shut down the 
occupied territories today in a general strike viewed as a test of 
the sixmonth arab uprising one palestinian was shot and killed 
and seven were injured during demonstrations in the west bank 
the army put 190000 palestinians under restrictions to prevent 
violence on the opening day of the threeday strike called to 
protest a new middle east visit by secretary of state george p 
shultz a leaflet calling for the strike said shultz was trying to 
quell the uprising 
shultz returns to the middle east today for the fourth time in 
five months to win support for a us plan that calls for an 
international conference to launch peace talks 
in the west bank village of shuykh israeli soldiers fatally 
shot 20yearold mustafa ahmed halaika in the chest officials at 
the alia hospital in nearby hebron said 
they said two other arabs were wounded in the legs or arms and 
four suffered beating injuries or the effects of tear gas when a 
protest broke out in the village 
hospital officials also said that a 15yearold palestinian was 
wounded in his left arm during clashes with israeli soldiers in the 
nearby village of siir 
the army command said it was checking the reports one military 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity said reports from 
the village said halaika was killed by civilians but the reason 
for his death was not clear 
in jerusalems walled old city a group of youths demonstrated 
on the sacred temple mount after todays moslem prayers raising 
the outlawed palestinian flag police said 
in the gaza strip nearly all shops were closed public transit 
was shut down and streets were still similar reports came from 
cities and towns in the west bank 
in bethlehem on the west bank outlawed palestinian flags flew 
from electricity poles and normally crowded manger square was 
deserted 
observe the strike or we are going to burn read a slogan 
painted on a wall 
few of the 110000 palestinians who work in israel reported to 
their jobs according to arab and israeli media reports 
todays strike contrasted sharply with one on monday when 
thousands of arab workers defied orders issued in a leaflet from 
the underground united national leadership of the uprising 
mondays strike supported israeli officials view that the 
uprising was waning and political analysts said the new threeday 
protest would be a test for the uprising 
this is very important for the image of the leadership said 
clinton bailey an arab affairs expert at tel aviv university 
saib erakat a palestinian political science professor 
predicted full compliance the israelis have been saying since 
december that the uprising is dying down said erakat who 
teaches at the west banks annajah university 
he said mondays partial failure came from confusion over dates 
not fatigue among palestinians 
in addition to shultzs visit the strike call also coincides 
with the sixth anniversary of israels invasion of lebanon on 
monday and sundays 21st anniversary of the 1967 middle east war 
in which israel captured the west bank and gaza strip from its arab 
neighbors 
prime minister yitzhak shamir said in remarks broadcast today by 
the army radio that he saw signs the uprising was waning but he 
added 
unfortunately there are also things that prevent this from 
happening including all kinds of undesirable intervention by jews 
and israelis 
curfews were clamped today on the shati and jabaliya refugee 
camps in gaza and the towns of shuweika jamain and qalqiliya in 
the west bank an army spokesman said eight other areas were 
declared closed preventing people from coming and going 
nearly 170000 people in the gaza strip and another 20000 in 
the west bank were affected by the restrictions 
according to un figures 199 palestinians have been killed in 
the uprising two israelis also have died 
the army on thursday retracted figures it released earlier this 
week which put the arab death toll at 207 the army said it had 
changed how it compiles the deaths and spokesman col raanan 
gissin said the army was certain of only 152 deaths all at the 
hands of soldiers

my lord mayor mr president your excellencies my lords 
aldermen sheriffs ladies and gentlemen 
weve been privileged mr president to hear you deliver this 
first report of your historic summit meeting with general secretary 
gorbachev in moscow 
it was an honor for us and fitting that you choose to do so here 
in london in this ancient on honor for us because of our 
friendship with united states of america of friendship which is 
indissoluble and fitting because this city of london and all that 
it stands for are part of your heritage as well ours 
we warmly congratulate you and general secretary gorbachev for a 
very successful summit one which will influence the course of 
history for years to come it is the result of months indeed 
years of hard work by you by secretary shultz and countless 
others and we should like to say thank you to mrs reagan too 
for the splendid support which she always gives 
the summit has brought us closer to the more stable relations 
between east and west that we all want to see indeed i believe 
there is now more hope between east and west than ever before in 
the lifetime of most of here 
it was so characteristic of you mr president not to flinch 
from taking the fight for fundamental human rights to the very 
heart of the soviet union your words in moscow will have shone 
like a beacon of hope for all those wherever they are who are 
denied their basic freedoms 
but as i listened to you mr president i couldnt help 
thinking of your achievements as president achievements over 
nearly eight years which have made possible this summit and so much 
else besides 
your leadership has made america strong and confident again and 
we in britain should like to say thank you for being such a staunch 
and loyal ally to this country and to europe 
i recall what winston churchill once wrote where we are able 
to stand together and work together for righteous causes we shall 
always be thankful and the world will always be free 
you mr president have successfully negotiated the first 
reductions in nuclear weapons you changed attitudes and 
perceptions about what is possible the most difficult thing of all 
in politics and youve done it now by bowing to the wishes and 
whims of others but by standing firm in your own beliefs as we 
heard once again today 
its as if you had said at the beginning of your life in 
politics this i believe this i act upon this i will always 
believe this i will always act upon and thank goodness you have 
from that strong fortress of convictions you set out to enlarge 
freedom the world over your personal coverage your gentle humor 
and your spirit of optimism are all part of a special quality which 
you have brought to the presidency above all and in this you have 
done the greatest possible service not only your own people but to 
free people everywhere you have restored faith in the american 
dream a dream of boundless opportunity built on enterprise 
individual effort and personal generosity 
when we compare the mood of confidence and optimism in the west 
today with the mood when you took office in 1980 we know that a 
greater change has taken place than ever we could have imagined 
mr president you spoke of seeking a newer world you are doing so 
with all the qualities of which tennyson spoke in that verse 
strong in will to strive to seek to find and not to yield 
my lord mayor i believe everyone present in this guildhall will 
join me in saying thank you mr president thank you for the 
summit thank you for your presidency thank you for your testament 
of belief and god bless america

nobel peace prize winner andrei d sakharov told 
reporters today that soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev must be 
given the benefit of the doubt to implement his reforms and improve 
human rights 
in a scene that would have been unthinkable in the past 
sakharov spoke to reporters for almost two hours at the foreign 
ministry press center 
sakharov said the fact that he was appearing at the press center 
reflects a change in the situation in this country and its not a 
matter of me changing my position 
one of the soviet unions leading physicists sakharo was a 
founder of the soviet dissident movement and was confined for 
nearly seven years to the closed city of gorky for his criticism of 
the soviet intervention in afghanistan 
i believe sizeable changes have taken place of late of 
course they are not exhaustive and do not ensure the full 
implementation of human rights sakharov said 
he said he has a lot of apprehensions about the future of 
gorbachevs reforms for soviet society but believes they ultimately 
will succeed because they are a historic necessity 
we should give it an advance measure of trust he said an 
expression of trust in perestroika at this time would only 
encourage it and improve the human rights situation 
perestroika which means restructuring refers to 
gorbachevs efforts to reform the economy and society 
sakharov praised this weeks moscow summit meeting but said the 
americans and soviets could have made more progress on nuclear 
weapons talks 
the specific results of the summit were not as impressive as 
the washington summit he said 
sakharov urged the two sides to work for more progress on a 
treaty to halve their longrange nuclear missiles saying they can 
work around their disputes over reagans planned strategic defense 
initiative the star wars spacebased nuclear shield and 
verification 
i am sure that talking about the 50 percent cuts an agreement 
is possible even without any connection to the sdi program he 
said settling of verification problems is possible if the two 
sides decide politically to do it he said 
sakharovs wife yelena bonner bitterly criticized a reporter 
for asking whether sakharov had made an agreement with authorities 
not to talk about certain topics at the unusual news conference 
she said sakharov held the news conference because reporters in 
moscow for the summit meeting between president reagan and 
gorbachev had called from morning to night asking for 
interviews 
sakharov who helped develop the soviet hydrogen bomb in the 
1950s won the nobel peace prize in 1975 for his human rights work 
in january 1980 he was banished to the closed city of gorky for 
criticizing the soviet military intervention in afghanistan and 
remained there until december 1986 when gorbachev allowed him to 
return to moscow 
he has since returned to his scientific work and has become 
increasingly reluctant to talk to reporters instead he has 
expressed his opinions in several letters published in the official 
soviet press 
he said he was told late last year by president gury marchuk of 
the soviet academy of sciences that he may not leave the country 
because of secret information to which he had access until 1968 
personally i believe its not a matter of my former access to 
secret information its a matter of confidence in me he said

an advertisement for a swank shopping 
mall that used the term bag lady to describe a welldressed 
shopper has been pulled after city officials called it offensive 
officials at newport centre a new mall on the jersey city 
waterfront across from manhattan apologized and withdrew the 
newspaper spots 
the ads asked what you do call a typical shopper at newport 
centre 
bag lady is the answer next to a picture of a woman 
dressed to the nines and holding a newport centre shopping bag 
barbara willis a spokeswoman for newport said the ad campaign 
was developed around the theme of shopping bags and the reference 
to bag lady was just one of those things that got by us 
she said the shopping center had received several telephone

must carry around their belongings in shopping bags 
mayor anthony r cucci said bag lady has a very special 
meaning in jersey city and it is not this they should know 
better

the chairman of the white house aids 
commission said today he sees little room for debate over his 
strong recommendations which are getting rave reviews from public 
figures active in the battle against the disease 
as affected groups challenged president reagan to follow through 
on the recommendations made public thursday commission chairman 
james d watkins stressed his call for strong federal 
antidiscrimination protection of aids victims he said on nbctvs 
today show that without such protection fear among victims 
will make the fatal disease very difficult to control 
the administration is on record through health and human 
services secretary otis r bowen as opposing federal legislation 
saying the issue should be addressed at the state and local level 
watkins a retired navy admiral said there could still be 
debate on the commission before the recommendations which now 
number 579 go to the president but he said in his opinion there 
is little room for debate 
i believe were there and its certainly in my opinion from 
the nearly 600 recommendations a kind of indictment on all of us 
that we havent done the job in being responsive to this 
epidemic watkins said 
response to the report from members of congress gay rights 
groups and health officials was enthusiastic 
the aids commission is giving us sound recommendations said 
rep 
henry waxman dcalif i hope the president will follow his 
own commissions advice 
waxman is among several members of congress pushing for 
antidiscrimination legislation 
tim sweeney deputy executive director of the new yorkbased gay 
mens health crisis termed the report courageous aggressive and 
compassionate 
we challenge the president congress and presidential 
candidates to respond to this report by implementing its 
recommendations said sweeney 
paul kawata director of the national aids network applauded 
most of the report particularly the sections calling for more 
financial support for communitybased aids groups the national 
aids network is an umbrella organization covering more than 450 
such local education and service agencies 
bailus walker jr the former massachusetts health commissioner 
who heads the american public health association a private 
organization of health professionals said the recommendations 
are a rational intelligent and compassionate response to the 
epidemic and should serve as a blueprint for a coordinated 
federal state and local program designed to address the full scope 
of the problem 
most of the 269page draft recommendations watkins issued 
thursday are expected to be adopted with little substantive change 
by the full commission and become its final report to the white 
house on june 24 
watkins told reporters the proposals represent my estimate of 
consensus within the commission with the exception of a final 
chapter which was not discussed in advance with other commissioners 
in that chapter watkins calls for legislation giving the 
surgeon general sweeping powers to deal with future national 
medical emergencies that would be declared by a president 
the report went on to call for federal legislation which 
clearly provides comprehensive antidiscrimination protection for 
hivinfected individuals 
hivrelated discrimination is impairing this nations ability 
to limit the spread of the epidemic watkins report said as 
long as discrimination occurs and no strong national policy with 
rapid and effective remedies against discrimination is established 
individuals who are infected with the hiv the aids virus will be 
reluctant to come forward for testing counseling and care 
watkins said implementing all his recommendations probably would 
call for spending about 3 billion a year more than is now being 
budgeted for aids about half that would be for expanded drug 
treatment programs a cornerstone of the commissions interim 
report 
among the major watkins recommendations 
strong new laws on confidentiality with sanctions to protect 
the identity of those who test positive for the aids virus 
greater statefederal financing of innovative methods of care 
for people with aids 
establishment of effective state partnernotification programs 
targeted at those who have had sex with someone known by health 
authorities to be infected with the virus 
viewing the scope of the epidemic in terms of the number of 
people infected with the virus perhaps as many as 14 million 
americans rather than the number who have so far developed aids 
less than 70000 scientists believe almost all of those infected 
will eventually develop the disease itself 
implementation of a comprehensive health education curriculum 
in american schools covering kindergarten through 12th grade to 
be in place by the year 2000 the curriculum including the point 
at which aids should be discussed would be determined at the 
local level 
under watkins plan the surgeon general would take charge in 
national health emergencies and be authorized to waive business 
as usual procedures which impede emergency responsiveness 
watkins says the present federal health bureaucracy has not 
been successful in facilitating a response to a public health 
emergency and resulted in a slow halting and uneven response

plo leader yasser arafat 
said secretary of state george shultz will not succeed in reaching 
peace in the middle east unless his plan includes the palestine 
liberation organization 
arafat said shultz who headed to egypt today to start his third 
shuttle to promote a regional peace plan is moving round in a 
vicious circle 
in an interview with abu dhabi television broadcast late 
thursday arafat said the plan shultz is promoting excludes the 
palestinian nation and its legitimate representative the plo 
he will not succeed with his plan because it runs counter to 
the un resolutions that recognize the palestinian nations right 
to an independent state on its national soil arafat said 
the plo leader said the shultz mission was designed to protect 
israel from the earthquake caused by the uprising and the 
steadfastness in south lebanon 
arafat was referring to the uprising by palestinians in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip that began dec 8 
palestinians in south lebanon which borders israel mount 
operations against the israelis 
arafat gave the interview during a twoday visit to the united 
arab emirates he is touring arab capitals before an arab summit 
june 7 in algiers algeria on the palestinian uprising 
the plo has rejected the shultz plan because it reportedly 
envisages only a limited selfrule on the west bank and gaza strip 
in an initial phase and does not recognize the plo which is 
fighting a guerrilla war for a palestinian homeland as the leader 
of the palestinians 
the plan calls for an international peace conference and 
negotiations on an palestinian homeland

here is a transcript of president reagans address 
friday to the royal institute of international affairs at guildhall 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i wonder if you can imagine what it is for an american to stand 
in this place back in the states were terribly proud of anything 
more than a few hundred years old some even see my election to the 
presidency as americas attempt to show our european cousins that 
we too have a regard for antiquity 
guild hall has been here since the 15th century and while it is 
comforting at my age to be near anything that much older than 
myself the venerable age of this institution is hardly all that 
impresses who could come here and not think upon the moments these 
walls have seen many times the people of this city and nation have 
gathered here in national crisis or national triumph 
in the darkest hours of the last world war when the tense drama 
of edward r murrows opening this is london was enough to 
impress on millions of americans the mettle of the british people 
how many times in those days did proceedings continue here a 
testimony to the cause of civilization for which you stood from 
the marne to el alamein to arnhem to the falklands you have in 
this century so often remained stedfast for what is right and 
against what is wrong 
you are a brave people and this land truly is as your majestic 
moving hymn proclaims a land of hope and glory thts why nancy 
and i in the closing days of this historic trip are glad to be in 
england once again after a long journey we feel among friends 
and with all our hearts we thank you for having us here such 
feelings are of course especially appropriate to this occasion 
i have come from moscow to report to you for truly the 
relationship between the united states and great britain has been 
critical to natos success in the cause of freedom this hardly 
means that weve always had a perfect understanding when i first 
visited mrs thatcher at the british embassy in 1981 she 
mischievously reminded me that the huge portrait dominating the 
grand staircase was none other than that of george iii though she 
did graciously concede that today most of her countrymen would 
agree with jefferson that a little rebellion now and then is a good 
thing so there has always been as there should be among friends 
an element of fun about our differences but let me assure you it 
is how much we have in common and the depth of our friendship that 
truly matters 
i have often mentioned this in the states but ive never had an 
opportunity to tell a british audience how during my first visit 
here 40 years ago i was like most americans anxious to see some 
of the sites and those 400yearold inns id been told abount in 
this country well the driver took me and a couple of other people 
to an old inn a pub really in what america we would call a mom 
and pop place 
this elderly lady was waiting on us and finally hearing us talk 
to one another she said youre americans arent you and we 
said we were oh she said there were a lot of your chaps 
stationed down the road during the war and she added they 
used to come in here in the evening and theyd have a songfest 
they called me mom and they called the old man pop 
and then the mood changed and she said it was christmas eve 
and you know we were all alone and feeling a bit down and suddenly 
they burst through the door and they had presents for me and 
pop and by this time she wasnt looking at us anymore she was 
looking off into the distance into memory and with tears in her 
eyes and then she said big strappin lads they was from a 
place called ioway 
well from a place called ioway and oregon california texas 
new jersey georgia here with other young men from lancaster 
hampshire glasgow and dorset all of them caught up in the 
terrible paradoxes of that time that young men must wage war to 
end war and die for freedom so that freedom itself might live 
and it is those same two causes for which they fought and died 
the cause of peace the cause of freedom for all humanity that 
still brings us british and american together for these causes 
the people of great britain the united states and other allied 
nations have for 44 years made enormous sacrifices to keep our 
alliance strong and our military ready 
for them we embark in this decade on a new postwar strategy a 
forward strategy of freedom a strategy of public candor about the 
moral and fundamental differences between statism and democracy 
but also a strategy of vigorous diplomatic engagement a policy 
that rejects both the inevitability of war or the permanence of 
totalitarian rule a policy based on realism that seeks not just 
treaties for treaties sake but the recognition and resolution of 
fundamental differences with our adversaries 
pursuit of this policy has just now taken me to moscow and let 
me say i believe this policy is bearing fruit quite possibly 
were beginning to break down the barriers of the postwar era 
quite possibly we are entering an era in history a time of 
lasting change in the soviet union we will have to see but if 
so its because of the stedfastness of the allies the 
democracies for more than 40 years and especially in this decade 
the history of our time will undoubtedly include a footnote 
about how during this decade and the last the voices of retreat 
and hopelessness reached a crescendo in the west insisting the 
only way to peace was unilateral disarmament proposing nuclear 
freezes opposing deployment of counterbalancing weapons such as 
intermediaterange missiles or the more recent concept of strategic 
defense systems these same voices ridiculed the notion of going 
beyond arms control the hope of doing something more than merely 
establishing artificial limits within which arms buildups could 
continue all but unabated 
arms reduction would never work they said and when the soviets 
left the negotiating in geneva for 15 months they proclaimed 
disaster and yet it was our doublezero option much maligned 
when first proposed that provided the basis for the inf treaty 
the first treaty ever that did not just control offensive weapons 
but reduced them and yes actually eliminated an entire class of 
us and soviet nuclear missiles 
this treaty last months development in afghanistan the 
changes we see in the soviet union these are momentous events not 
conclusive but momentous and thats why although history will 
duly note that we too heard voices of denial and doubt it is 
those who spoke with hope and strength who will be best remembered

about 2000 students from chinas most 
prestigious university took to the streets today to protest the 
death of a fellow student in a brawl 
the students at beijing university put up posters angrily 
demanding speedy punishment of local youths who killed the student 
and tighter security around campus 
foreign sources said the illegal demonstration began 
spontaneously at about 11 pm thursday after students read a 
poster on campus describing how chai qingfeng a 22yearold 
geophysics student had been attacked and killed 
no participants were arrested 
officials said today that three people suspected in chais 
slaying were detained and others were being sought 
the demonstration was the largest since massive prodemocracy 
rallies in december 1986 and january 1987 those demonstrations led 
to shakeups in the government and a conservative backlash against 
bourgeois liberalization 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
students arrived at tiananmen square the large plaza in central 
beijing shortly before dawn and passed through the square before 
stopping at the ministry of public security where they presented a 
list of demands 
about 700 students completed the 10mile walk from the campus in 
northwest beijing to the square 
during the march they linked arms and shouted for justice and 
human rights one banner read pay back the blood debt 
police monitored the march but did not interfere said one 
18yearold marcher 
the group marched around tiananmen and then went to the nearby 
public security ministry where the officials saidthey understood 
us but that it is not a good idea to take to the streets said 
the woman marcher speaking on condition of anonymity 
the students presented eight demands including the speedy 
arrest and punishment of the killers then got on buses and 
returned quietly to campus 
students said chai was beaten to death by hooligans when he 
was buying liquor at a store outside the campus campus officials 
said the attack took place wednesday night and chai died thursday 
the beijing daily reported today that chai a graduate student 
was among three students from the geophysics department who were 
attacked by thugs outside a small restaurant near the campus it 
did not say whether the other two were injured 
the daily quoted city officials as saying that such acts of 
violence will not be tolerated in the capital and that they had 
asked police to deal quickly and severely with the assailants 
the students also demanded full media coverage of the slaying a 
memorial service on campus for chai government compensation for 
his family and tighter campus security 
one poster called for a boycott of classes until the killers 
were arrested but students said most students attended classes 
last december about 1000 students from the university of 
foreign economic relations in beijing demonstrated over a similar 
incident when a student was knifed to death by hoodlums 
one of the attackers in that incident a 22yearold man was 
executed

sixty percent of doctors responding to a survey 
said they have had patients for whom they thought euthanasia would 
be justified if legal and 59 percent of those said they would have 
administered a lethal drug if permitted 
the survey conducted by the center for health ethics and policy 
at the university of colorado at denver was intended to spark 
discussion on questions of death and dying said dr frederick 
abrams associate director of the center 
questionnaires were mailed to 7095 doctors in colorado and 
2218 responded by the january deadline 
in one form or another euthanasia is being practiced by 
decent professionals and supported by the affected patients yet it 
is opposed by large numbers of people we must develop consensus in 
colorado concerning legal and ethical ground rules abrams said 
thirtyseven percent of the doctors responding to the 
questionnaire said said they had given pain medication even though 
it would hasten the patients death 
and 4 percent of the doctors said they had helped patients 
stockpile lethal doses of medication knowing that the drugs might 
be used to commit suicide 
euthanasia is defined in websters new world dictionary as 
causing death painlessly so as to end suffering advocated by 
some as a way to deal with persons dying of incurable painful 
diseases 
on the question of prolonging life 90 percent of the doctors 
said quality of life should be a consideration when deciding 
whether or not someone is to be treated with criticalcare 
technology 
a strong majority 88 percent said colorados living will law 
should be changed to allow the patient to decline food or fluid 
and 85 percent thought the law that denies the patient the option 
to refuse food and fluid is unsatisfactory 
colorados living will law allows competent adults to direct 
future withholding or withdrawing of lifesustaining procedures 
should they become unconscious or incompetent to decide on medical 
treatment

and here i want to say that through all the troubles of the last 
decade one such firm eloquent voice a voice that proclaimed 
proudly the cause of the western alliance and human freedom has 
been heard a voice that never sacrificed its anticommunist 
credentials or its realistic appraisal of change in the soviet 
union but because it came from the longest serving leader in the 
alliance it did become one of the first to suggest that we could 
do business with mr gorbachev 
so let me discharge my first official duty here today prime 
minister the achievements of the moscow summit as well as the 
geneva and washington summits say much about your valor and 
strength and by virtue of the office you hold that of the british 
people so let me say simply at this hour in history prime 
minister the entire world salutes you and your gallant people and 
gallant nation 
and while your leadership and the vision of the british people 
have been an inspiration not just to my own people but to all of 
those love freedom and yearn for peace i know you join me in a 
deep sense of gratitude toward the leaders and peoples of all the 
democratic allies whether deploying crucial weapons of deterrence 
standing fast in the persian gulf combating terrorism and 
aggression by outlaw regions or helping freedom fighters around the 
globe rarely in history has any alliance of free nations acted 
with such firmness and dispatch and on so many fronts 
in the process reaching back as far as the founding nato and 
the common market the house of western europe together with the 
united states canada japan and others this house of democracy 
engaged in an active diplomacy while sparking a startling growth of 
democratic institutions and free markets all across the globe in 
short an expansion of the frontiers of freedom and a lessening of 
the chances of war 
and so it is within this context that i report now on events in 
moscow 
on wednesday at 820 greenwich time mr gorbachev and i 
exchanged the instruments of ratification of the inf treaty so 
too we made tangible progress toward the start treaty on strategic 
weapons such a treaty with all its implications is i believe 
now within our grasp but part of the realism and candor we were 
determined to bring to negotiations with the soviets meant refusing 
to put all the weight of these negotiations and our bilateral 
relationship on the single issue of arms control 
as i never tire of saying nations do not distrust each other 
because they are armed they are armed because they distrust each 
other so equally important items on the agenda dealt with critical 
issues like regional conflicts human rights and bilateral 
exchanges 
with regard to regional conflicts here too we are in the 
third week of the pullout of soviet troops from afghanistan the 
importance of this step should not be underestimated our third 
area of discussion was bilateral contacts between our peoples an 
expanding program of student exchanges of the opening of cultural 
centers progress toward a broader understanding of each other 
and finally on the issue of human rights granting people the 
right to speak write travel and worship freely there are signs 
of greater individual freedom 
now originally i was going to give you just an accounting on 
these items but you know on my first day in moscow mr gorbachev 
used a russian saying better to see something once than to hear 
about it a hundred times 
so if i might go beyond our fourpart agenda today and offer 
just a moment or too of personal reflection on the country i saw 
for the first time in all aspects of soviet life the talk is of 
progress toward democratic reform in the economy in political 
institutions in religious social and artistic life it is called 
glasnost openness it is perestroika restructuring 
mr gorbachev and i discussed his upcoming party conference 
where many of these reforms will be debated and perhaps adopted 
such things as official accountability limitations on length of 
service in office an independent judiciary revisions of the 
criminal law and lowering the taxes on cooperatives in short 
giving individuals more freedom to run their own affairs to 
control their own destinies

to those of us familiar with the postwar era all of this is 
cause for shaking the head in wonder imagine the president of the 
united states and the general secretary of the soviet union walking 
together in red square talking about a growing personal friendship 
and meeting together average citizens realizing how much our 
people have in common it was a special moment in a week of special 
moments 
my personal impression of mr gorbachev is that he is a serious 
man seeking serious reform i pray that the hand of the lord will 
be on the soviet people the people who faces nancy and i saw 
everywhere we went believe me there was one thing about those 
faces that we will never forget they were the faces of hope the 
hope of a new era in human history and hopefully an era of peace 
and freedom for all 
and yet while the moscow summit showed great promise and the 
response of the soviet people was heartening let me interject here 
a note of caution and i hope prudence it has never been disputes 
between free peoples and the peoples of the soviet union that have 
been at the heart of postwar tensions and conflicts moral 
disputes among governments over the pursuit of statism and 
expansionism have been central points in our difficulties 
but now that the allies are strong and expansionism is receding 
around the world and the soviet union there is hope and we look 
for this trend to continue we must do all we can to assist it and 
this means openly acknowledging positive change and crediting it 
but let us also remember the strategy that we have adopted is one 
that provides for setbacks along the way as well as progress let 
us embrace honest change when it occurs but let us also be wary 
let us stay strong and let us be confident too 
prime minister perhaps you remember that upon accepting your 
gracious invitation to address the members of the parliament in 
1982 i suggested then that the world could well be at a turning 
point when the two great threats to life in this century nuclear 
war and totalitarian rule might now be overcome 
in an accounting of what might lie ahead for the rest of the 
alliance i suggested that the hard evidence of the totalitarian 
experiment was now in and that this evidence had led to an 
uprising of the intellect and will one that reaffirmed the dignity 
of the individual in the face of the modern state i suggested 
too that in a way marx was right when he said the political order 
would come into conflict with the economic order only he was wrong 
in predicting which part of the world this would occur in 
for the crisis came not in the capitalist west but in the 
communist east noting the economic difficulties reaching the 
critical stage in the soviet union and in eastern europe i said 
that at other times in history the ruling elites have faced such 
situations and when they encountered resolve and determination from 
free nations decided to loosen their grip it was then i suggested 
that the tides of history were running in the cause of liberty but 
only if we as free men and women joined together in a worldwide 
movement toward democracy a crusade for freedom a crusade that 
would be not so much a struggle of armed might not so much a test 
of bombs and rockets as a test of faith and will 
well that crusade for freedom that crusade for peace is well 
under way we have found the will we have held fast to the faith 
and whatever happens whatever triumphs or disappointments ahead 
we must keep to this strategy of strength and candor this strategy 
of hope hope in the eventual triumph of freedom 
but as we move forward let us not fail to note the lessons 
weve learned along the way in developing our strategy we have 
learned the first objective of the adversaries of freedom is to 
make free nations question their own faith in freedom to make us 
think that adhering to our principles and speaking out against 
human rights abuses or foreign aggression is somehow an act of 
belligerence well over the long run such inhibitions make free 
peoples silent and ultimately halfhearted about their cause this 
is the first and most important defeat free nations can ever suffer

hailed by trumpet fanfares and cheering crowds 
president reagan today savored londons pageantryfilled tribute to 
his performance at the moscow summit and a toast from prime 
minister margaret thatcher as one of the greatest us 
presidents 
the president rode triumphantly through the streets of the 
british capital near the end of a twoday stopover en route home 
from moscow londoners waved at his motorcade from along the river 
thames from the tops of doubledecker buses and from boats in hyde 
parks serpentine lake 
flanked by bewigged scarletrobed city fathers at guildhall 
the 12th century seat of londons lord mayor reagan was welcomed 
as a peacemaker and won a standing ovation for an emotional speech 
on eastwest relations laced with jibes at the antinuclear lobby 
and jokes about his age 
lord mayor sir greville spratt invoked the names of ulysses s 
grant and woodrow wilson past us presidents who have spoken at 
guildhall and reached to milton and shakespeare for words to 
describe his admiration for reagan 
not to be outdone mrs thatcher quoted tennysons line 
strong in will to strive to seek to find and not to yield 
turning to reagan she said 
thank you mr president thank you for the summit thank you 
for your presidency thank you for your testament of belief and god 
bless america 
the only visible dissent came from actress julie christie and 
eight other british show business personalities who picketed 
guildhall during reagans speech to protest us involvement in 
nicaragua they waved placards reading us out of central 
america and distributed leaflets urging withdrawal of support for 
the contra rebels 
the president saw a more open society in red square than here 
in london miss christie said complaining that police kept the 
demonstrators out of sight of the presidents motorcade 
mrs thatcher hailed reagans summit talks as a tremendous 
success 
reagan returned the compliment paying a special tribute to his 
close friend and ally the president noted that mrs thatcher had 
been among the first to suggest the west could do business with 
gorbachev 
at this hour in history prime minister the entire world 
salutes you and your gallant people and gallant nation he said 
most of reagans 26hour visit was ceremonial including 
parades tea with queen elizabeth ii and dinner at mrs thatchers 
residence at 10 downing st 
the prime minister said she was especially pleased with reagans 
strong stance on human rights and his street encounters with 
muscovites because the russian people would find it difficult now 
to see the united states as a threat in the future 
reagan told her he felt gorbachev was vigorous and determined 
to carry out his reform program officials said 
reagan invited mrs thatcher to washington in november after the 
presidential election to see him before he leaves office she 
immediately accepted and white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said she presumably would also meet the presidentelect 
unlike us presidents who are limited to two terms british 
prime ministers can serve for an indefinite period mrs thatcher 
having been elected three times has indicated she wants to lead 
her conservative party to a fourth victory 
mrs thatcher a firm believer in nuclear deterrence is wary of 
sweeping arms cuts a british official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said reagan told mrs thatcher he would not be rushed 
into an agreement to halve the superpowers longrange nuclear 
missiles 
we dont have any reservations about the position of the 
united states on this the british official said 
but when a reporter asked reagan to comment on gorbachevs claim 
that arms negotiations were going too slowly he replied id 
like to speed them up 
shortly after their arrival thursday the president and mrs 
reagan drove to buckingham palace where there were waves and 
cheers from some 1500 spectators as they drove through the ornate 
blackandgold gates of the 285yearold palace they were greeted 
by queen elizabeth ii 
nice to see you again how are you mr president said the 
queen entering the marblecolumned main hall wearing a 
sapphireblue dress 
a reporter asked reagan if he was glad to be out of moscow and 
in london reagan replied diplomatically let me put it very 
simply im very happy to be in london 
elizabeth received the reagans alone since her husband prince 
philip was out of town her son and heir prince charles later 
called on mrs reagan at the ambassadors home 
from the palace reagan drove to nearby whitehall to inspect an 
honor guard in the graceful columned quadrangle of the foreign 
office 
mrs thatcher 62 whose nine years in office have paralleled 
the reagan tenure and forged close ties received him with a warm 
embrace of clasped elbows 
the welsh guards in their scarlet tunics and tall black bearskin 
hats played the american anthem and two irving berlin hits 
then reagan and mrs thatcher walked next door to 10 downing st 
for talks and mrs reagan arrived later for a dinner of lobster 
mousse chicken with pate de fois gras and raspberries 
after dinner mrs thatcher and reagan watched from a window as 
horsemen and a band performed the ceremony of beating retreat one 
of the rituals leading up to the queens birthday

the moscow summit eased tensions between 
the united states and the soviet union but us intransigence 
prevented progress on nuclear disarmament news reports in 
communist eastern europe said today 
some shady aspects of president reagans visit cannot 
overshadow the fact that the summit turned into a significant 
political event blazing the trail toward the 21st century 
otechestven front a bulgarian daily said 
reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev met in moscow from 
sunday to thursday it was their fourth meeting 
an editorial in the czechoslovak communist party newspaper rude 
pravo said the sovietus dialogue had reached a new higher 
level after several icy years but it added the united states 
has gone a considerable part of the way but does not want to go to 
the end of this road 
rude pravo said us politicians cherish an illusion that 
nuclear weapons protect peace and that is why they are 
necessary for us security they also claim that space weapons 
protect against nuclear weapons 
the daily criticized the united states for stubbornly trying 
to gain unilateral advantages mainly in talks on a 50 
percent reduction of strategic weapons and in such an important 
question as the sdi program 
the soviet union also has called on the united states to scrap 
the proposed space defense initiative or star wars 
in hungary magyar nemzet the daily of the communistled 
patriotic peoples front commented one can already feel the 
beneficial effect of an international crisissettling mechanism in 
motion and a compromiseoriented approach on the part of both 
superpowers seems to be taking shape 
the hungarian trade union daily nepszava said even if there 
have been some less heartening moments at this summit like 
reagans meeting with dissenters his meetings with the soviet 
people took place in an atmopshere that washed away the memory of 
such moments 
it added naturally we would have simply loved to read in the 
joint communique a reference to a great leap forward toward the 
next missile treaty we regret that instead of a leap only a 
modest step has been taken 
the east german communist party newspaper neues deutschland said 
it is with great satisfaction that all those who are committed 
toward securing peace have also accepted the fact that now there is 
a joint draft of a text for a treaty on reducing and limiting 
strategic offensive weapons 
the polish communist party daily trybuna ludu said one cannot 
shake the impression that the american side did not rid itself of 
the deeply rooted prejudices and inhibitions 
all smiles but what is inside it said one polish 
journalist who was asked for his reaction 
we are satisfied stefan staniszewski a spokesman for the 
polish foreign ministry said we think that the summit was 
successful not only as a summit but as a process which will 
be continued in the future 
the summit shows the soviet and us governments see each other 
as partners in a way in which they were not always able to see 
themselves in the past said warsaws zycie warszawy daily it 
warrants the presumption that the change of the us presidency 
should not alter the practice now adopted

hailed by trumpet fanfares and cheering crowds 
president reagan today savored londons pageantryfilled tribute to 
his performance at the moscow summit and a toast from prime 
minister margaret thatcher as one of the greatest us 
presidents 
the president rode triumphantly through the streets of the 
british capital near the end of a twoday stopover en route home 
from moscow londoners waved at his motorcade from along the river 
thames from the tops of doubledecker buses and from boats in hyde 
parks serpentine lake 
flanked by bewigged scarletrobed city fathers at guildhall 
the 12th century seat of londons lord mayor reagan was welcomed 
as a peacemaker and won a standing ovation for an emotional speech 
on eastwest relations laced with jibes at the antinuclear lobby 
and jokes about his age 
lord mayor sir greville spratt invoked the names of ulysses s 
grant and woodrow wilson past us presidents who have spoken at 
guildhall and reached to milton and shakespeare for words to 
describe his admiration for reagan 
not to be outdone mrs thatcher quoted tennysons line 
strong in will to strive to seek to find and not to yield 
turning to reagan she said 
thank you mr president thank you for the summit thank you 
for your presidency thank you for your testament of belief and god 
bless america 
the only visible dissent came from actress julie christie and 
eight other british show business personalities who picketed 
guildhall during reagans speech to protest us involvement in 
nicaragua they waved placards reading us out of central 
america and distributed leaflets urging withdrawal of support for 
the contra rebels 
the president saw a more open society in red square than here 
in london miss christie said complaining that police kept the 
demonstrators out of sight of the presidents motorcade 
mrs thatcher hailed reagans summit talks as a tremendous 
success 
reagan returned the compliment paying a special tribute to his 
close friend and ally the president noted that mrs thatcher had 
been among the first to suggest the west could do business with 
gorbachev 
at this hour in history prime minister the entire world 
salutes you and your gallant people and gallant nation he said 
most of reagans 26hour visit was ceremonial including 
parades tea with queen elizabeth ii and dinner at mrs thatchers 
residence at 10 downing st 
the prime minister said she was especially pleased with reagans 
strong stance on human rights and his street encounters with 
muscovites because the russian people would find it difficult now 
to see the united states as a threat in the future 
reagan told her he felt gorbachev was vigorous and determined 
to carry out his reform program officials said 
reagan invited mrs thatcher to washington in november after the 
presidential election to see him before he leaves office she 
immediately accepted and white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said she presumably would also meet the presidentelect 
unlike us presidents who are limited to two terms british 
prime ministers can serve for an indefinite period mrs thatcher 
having been elected three times has indicated she wants to lead 
her conservative party to a fourth victory 
mrs thatcher a firm believer in nuclear deterrence is wary of 
sweeping arms cuts a british official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said reagan told mrs thatcher he would not be rushed 
into an agreement to halve the superpowers longrange nuclear 
missiles 
we dont have any reservations about the position of the 
united states on this the british official said 
but when a reporter asked reagan to comment on gorbachevs claim 
that arms negotiations were going too slowly he replied id 
like to speed them up 
shortly after their arrival thursday the president and mrs 
reagan drove to buckingham palace where there were waves and 
cheers from some 1500 spectators as they drove through the ornate 
blackandgold gates of the 285yearold palace they were greeted 
by queen elizabeth ii 
nice to see you again how are you mr president said the 
queen entering the marblecolumned main hall wearing a 
sapphireblue dress 
a reporter asked reagan if he was glad to be out of moscow and 
in london reagan replied diplomatically let me put it very 
simply im very happy to be in london 
elizabeth received the reagans alone since her husband prince 
philip was out of town her son and heir prince charles later 
called on mrs reagan at the ambassadors home 
from the palace reagan drove to nearby whitehall to inspect an 
honor guard in the graceful columned quadrangle of the foreign 
office 
mrs thatcher 62 whose nine years in office have paralleled 
the reagan tenure and forged close ties received him with a warm 
embrace of clasped elbows 
the welsh guards in their scarlet tunics and tall black bearskin 
hats played the american anthem and two irving berlin hits 
then reagan and mrs thatcher walked next door to 10 downing st 
for talks and mrs reagan arrived later for a dinner of lobster 
mousse chicken with pate de fois gras and raspberries 
after dinner mrs thatcher and reagan watched from a window as 
horsemen and a band performed the ceremony of beating retreat one 
of the rituals leading up to the queens birthday

for when free peoples cease telling the truth about and to their 
adversaries they cease telling the truth to themselves in matters 
of state unless the truth be spoken it ceases to exist it is in 
this sense that the best indicator of how much we care about 
freedom is what we say about freedom it is in this sense that 
words truly are actions and there is one added and quite 
extraordinary benefit to this sort of realism and public candor 
this is also the best way to avoid war or conflict 
too often in the past the adversaries of freedom forgot the 
reserves of strength and resolve among free peoples too often they 
interpreted conciliatory words as weakness and too often they 
miscalculated and underestimated the willingness of free men and 
women to resist to the end words of freedom remind them otherwise 
this is the lesson weve learned the lesson of the last war 
yes the lesson of munich but it is also the lesson taught us by 
sir winston by london in the blitz by the enduring pride and 
faith of the british people 
just a few years ago her majesty queen elizabeth and i stood 
at the normandy beaches to commemorate the selflessness that comes 
from such pride and faith it is well we recall the lessons of our 
alliance 
and i wonder if you might permit me to recall one other this 
morning operation market garden it was called three months after 
overlord and the rescue of europe began a plan to suddenly drop 
british and american airborne divisions on the netherlands and open 
up a drive into the heart of germany 
a battalion of british paratroopers was given the great task of 
seizing the bridge deep in enemy territory at arnhem for the 
terrible 10 days they held out some years ago a reunion of those 
magnificent veterans british americans and others of our allies 
was held in new york city 
from the dispatch by the new york times reporter maurice 
carroll there was this paragraph look at him said henry knapp 
an amsterdam newspaper man who headed the dutch undergrounds 
intelligence operation in arnhem he gestured toward gen john 
frost a bluff britainer who had committed the battalion that held 
the bridge look at him still with that black mustache if you 
put him at the end of a bridge today and said keep it hed keep 
it the story mentioned the wife of cornelius ryan the american 
writer who memorialized market garden in his book a bridge too 
far 
he told the reporter just as mr ryan was finishing his book 
writing the final paragraphs about gen frosts valiant stand at 
arnhem about how in his eyes his men would always be undefeated 
her husband burst into tears that was quite unlike him and mrs 
ryan alarmed rushed to him the writer could only look up and say 
of gen frost honestly what that man went through 
a few days ago seated there in spaso house with soviet 
dissidents i had that same thought and asked myself what wont 
men suffer for freedom 
the dispatch about the arnhem veteran concluded with this quote 
from gen frost about his visits to that bridge 
weve been going back ever since every year we have a whats 
the word reunion now theres a word 
he turned to his wife dear whats the word for going to 
arnhem 
reunion she said no he said theres a special word 
she pondered pilgrimage she said yes pilgrimage gen 
frost said 
as those veterans of arnhem view their time so too we must 
view ours ours is also a pilgrimage a pilgrimage toward those 
things we honor and love human dignity the hope of freedom for 
all peoples and for all nations 
and ive always cherished the belief that all of history is such 
a pilgrimage and that our maker while never denying us free will 
does over time guide us with a wise and provident hand giving 
direction to history and slowly bringing it good from evil leading 
us ever so slowly but ever so relentlessly and lovingly to a 
moment when the will of man and god are as one again

i cherish too the hope that what we have done together 
throughout this decade and in moscow this week has helped bring 
mankind along the road of that pilgrimage if this be so prayerful 
recognition of what were about as a civilization and a people has 
played its part i mean of course the great civilized ideas that 
comprise so much of your heritage the development of law embodied 
by your constitutional traditions the idea of restraint on 
centralized power and individual rights as established in your 
magna carta the idea of representative government as embodied by 
the mother of all parliaments 
but we go beyond even this your own evelyn waugh who reminded 
us that civilization and by this i do not mean talking cinemas 
and tinned food nor even soldiery and hygenic houses but the 
whole moral and artistic organization of europe has not in itself 
the power of survival it came into being he said through the 
judeochristian tradition and without it has no significance or 
power to command allegiance it is no longer possible he wrote to 
accept the benefits of civilization and at the same time deny the 
supernatural basis on which it rests 
and so it is first things we must consider and here it is a 
story one last story that can remind us best of what were 
about its a story that a few years ago came in the guise of that 
art form for which i had an understandable affection the cinema 
its a story about the 1920 olympics and two british athletes 
harold abrahams a young jew whose victory as his immigrant 
arabitalian coach put it was a triumph for all those who have 
come from distant lands and found freedom and refuge here in 
england 
and eric lidell a young scotsman who would not sacrifice 
religious conviction for fame in one unforgettable scene eric 
lidell reads the words of isaiah he giveth power to the faint and 
to them that have no might he increased their strength but they 
that waiteth on the lord shall renew their strength they shall 
mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary 
here then is our formula for completing our crusade for 
freedom here the strength of our civilization and our belief in 
the rights of humanity our faith is in a higher law yes we 
believe in prayer and its power and like the founding fathers of 
both our lands we hold that humanity was meant not to be 
dishonored by the allpowerful state but to live in image and 
likeness of him who made us 
more than five decades ago when an american president told his 
generation that they had a rendezvous with destiny at almost the 
same moment a prime minister asked the british people for their 
finest hour this rendezvous this finest hour is still upon us 
let us seek to do his will in all things to stand for freedom to 
speak for humanity come my friends as it was said of old by 
tennyson it is not too late to seek a newer world 
thank you

at least two of the five city directors in 
this tobacco market center are reconsidering their support of a 
smoking ban following objections from a local tobacco company 
a policy banning smoking in the main lobby of city hall city 
commission chambers the city bus station and a handful of other 
places took effect wednesday over protests from pinkerton tobacco 
co daviess countys largest industrial employer 
owensboro is a major tobacco sales center for western kentucky 
burley the daviess county farm bureau estimates that area tobacco 
sales topped 25 million last year 
pinkerton in a letter dated may 20 notified mayor david 
adkisson that it will reconsider plans to expand in the county 
because of the ban 
if as it appears your recent enactment of a ban on our 
products is indicative of this communitys attitude toward the 
tobacco industry our company and our products then the time has 
come for us to begin rethinking our plans for the future luther 
pittman executive vice president of pinkerton wrote 
pinkerton which employs 504 people at its daviess county plant 
is the nations leading manufacturer of loose leaf and plug chewing 
tobaccos pittman said the company also makes smoking tobacco 
products 
pittman said his letter does not mean the company is planning to 
pull out of daviess county 
but pinkerton is in the process of acquiring smoking tobacco 
brands from the american tobacco company in richmond va he said 
and had planned to move manufacturing and distribution operations 
linked to such an acquisition to owensboro 
adkisson said he did not consider pittmans letter a threat by 
the company to leave town the smoking ban passed unanimously and 
adkisson said he still supports it 
but commissioner jack ross who voted with the three other 
commissioners and the mayor to approve the policy said thursday 
the board overreacted 
and commissioner waymond morris principal of daviess county 
high school said he probably will vote to rescind the policy 
he said the policy is doing something we didnt intend to 
do namely offending tobacco interests 
another commissioner alan braden said he is still weighing the 
policys benefits against its effects on tobacco interests 
adkisson said that in the past pinkerton has produced mostly 
smokeless tobacco and he didnt think about the company being 
adversely affected

the fireravaged first interstate bank tower 
will get an upgraded fire alarm system and a 3million sprinkler 
system as part of a deal to reopen the 62story downtown highrise 
fire officials said 
the skyscraper that is californias tallest building has been 
closed since may 4 when a fire gutted 4 floors killing one man 
and injuring about 40 other people 
city fire officials announced thursday that a partnership of the 
equitable life assurance society and ucb realty corp was agreeable 
to upgrading its alarm system beyond what is required by law 
the upgrades will include additional smoke detectors fire doors 
to enclose elevator vestibules and a third water pump for the 
sprinkler and water standpipes 
the improvements dont have to be completed before tenants 
return as long as the existing system is working properly said 
city fire department battalion chief kenneth johnson 
tower owners have verbally agreed to the upgrading although the 
exact timetable and specifications are still being negotiated 
johnson said 
we are obviously going to work hand in hand with fire 
officials its obviously in our best interests and the best 
interests of our tenants said jerry poppink a spokesman for the 
equitableucb partnership which owns the building 
when the may 4 fire broke out the buildings sprinkler system 
was nearly 90 percent complete but not operational a building 
spokesman said owners expect to restore the existing fire alarm 
system and activate the sprinklers by next month 
sprinklers werent mandatory for the highrise because it was 
built a year before a law requiring sprinklers took effect in 1974 
meanwhile the fire department is continuing to investigate 
whether to seek misdemeanor charges in the case in connection with 
possible fire code violations said capt john scherrei 
was there a delayed alarm were the security people informed 
of what to do were they notified to call the fire department were 
there code violations scherrei said listing the key questions 
in the fire departments investigation

women should not throw out their thyroid 
prescriptions even though a commonly prescribed hormone may cause 
some longterm thinning of the bones a doctor says 
the most commonly prescribed thyroid hormone lthyroxine 
previously had been considered safe when taken over a number of 
years says a study in todays journal of the american medical 
association 
but 31 young women treated with lthyroxine for at least five 
years were found to have 10 percent to 13 percent less bone density 
in their hips than 31 women in a comparison group matched for age 
and weight the study said 
loss of bone mass also called osteoporosis is usually most 
serious in women after menopause and is largely to blame for the 
hip fractures that afflict onethird of women who reach age 90 the 
study said 
but one of the authors cautioned that the study is only 
preliminary and we dont know and we are not suggesting that 
these very small changes in hip will be associated with an 
increased fracture rate 
we are not saying thyroid hormone should not be used because 
it causes bone loss said the coauthor dr lewis e braverman 
of the university of massachusetts medical school in worcester 
we are saying the dose of lthyroxine should be carefully 
adjusted to the individual need of the patient which can now be 
done with sensitive new assays he added in a telephone interview 
thursday 
before new tests were developed about two years ago to measure 
precise blood levels of lthyroxine marketed as levothroid and 
synthroid doctors were more likely to prescribe excess levels 
braverman said 
most of the millions of patients who take it must take it 
indefinitely to counteract the hormone deficiency created by an 
underactive thyroid gland thyroid cancer or a condition known as 
goiter an enlargement of the thyroid that leads to a swelling of 
the neck 
hypothyroidism causes body functions to slow down and if 
untreated can lead to a deterioration in the persons physical and 
mental health the problem can become so severe that simple mental 
tasks such as adding up a bill take longer 
one of the risks in something a finding like this is you 
have people say im going to stop taking my thyroid so i wont 
get osteoporosis thats disastrous braverman said 
but an editorial accompanying the study in the journal suggested 
that doctors may need to rethink their approach to treating thyroid 
hormone deficiencies 
is it appropriate to treat a benign thyroid problem with a 
medication that potentially could cause osteoporosis asked the 
editorial by dr david s cooper of johns hopkins university 
school of medicine in baltimore 
the whole concept of suppression therapy for benign thyroid 
disease may need reevaluation especially in older women whose 
skeletons are the most likely to be in jeopardy he said 
the study found no loss of bone mass in the spine the doctors 
said spinal bone loss can cause the reduction in height and back 
curvature that mark advanced cases of osteoporosis

a federal judge has ended almost two 
decades of judicial supervision of the oxford municipal school 
district ruling that it now complies with desegregation 
regulations 
the district has become fully unitary in all aspects 19 
years has certainly been more than a reasonable time to continue 
under supervision of a federal court us district judge william 
c keady said in an an order filed here thursday 
the school system had been under court order since it was 
ordered desegregated in 1969 following a complaint filed by blacks 
in 1968 
the district sought to have the order lifted and the issue was 
argued in a twoday hearing in may 
blacks represented by lawyer and local naacp president alvin 
chambliss argued that the system was still discriminatory in 
achievement grouping employment activities and discipline 
the district has about 2700 students in two elementary schools 
and a junior and senior high school about half are white and half 
are black 
keady said the system has been supported by the community and 
white flight to a nearby academy has been minimal 
under the court order the district had been required to submit 
lengthy reports on its activities to the court twice a year said 
superintendent bob mccord 
mccord said the district was pleased more with what the ruling 
said than its lifting of the paperwork 
i think what this says is the school district has done more 
than an adequate job of running a fair system mccord said i 
think it speaks well of the system the board and the community

opponents of mikhail s gorbachevs reforms are 
trying to block leading reformers from attending an upcoming 
communist party conference a key supporter of the soviet leader 
said today 
sociologist tatyana zaslavskaya a main author of gorbachevs 
reform campaign spoke about the party battles as gorbachev 
attended a meeting of the leaders of moscows communist party to 
choose delegates for the conference 
the official news agency tass said gorbachev addressed the 
meeting which was opened and closed by politburo member and moscow 
party head lev n zaikov 
details of the speeches or any other debate were not immediately 
available tass said 319 delegates were chosen to represent the 
almost 1 million communists of moscow at the conference 
zaslavskaya said at a news conference that the most pronounced 
advocates of perestroika were not selected in initial elections 
for party conference delegates but vitaly korotich editor of the 
weekly ogonyok said this week the initial selections might be 
revised at todays meeting 
tass said all 319 delegates chosen had recommended themselves 
with concrete deeds as champions of perestroika but did not 
mention any names 
leading reformers such as zaslavskaya economist abel 
aganbegyan historian yuri afanaseyev sociologist fyodor burlatsky 
and economist gavril popov received the most votes from party 
organizations at their places of work but were stricken from the 
list of potential candidates at the next level equivalent to 
precincts 
rank and file communists were somehow screened from the 
process zaslavskaya told foreign and soviet journalists at a 
news conference sponsored by the foreign ministry 
other reformers have told western reporters this week in moscow 
that they were trying to get their names resinstated at the city 
party meeting 
similar developments have been reported in other soviet cities 
and regions although the reports have not been as detailed as for 
moscow 
zaslavskaya said opposition to reform came from middlelevel 
party officials and managers who felt that their power was being 
threatened 
and she denied reports that politburo member yegor ligachev was 
leading the conservative movement and would be asked to resign 
of course the views of ligachev are not as radical as those of 
gorbachev but there are no grounds for thinking that he should be 
dismissed she said 
the party conference which opens on june 28 will be the 19th 
of its kind in party history but the first since 1941 
the englishlanguage service of radio moscow said the conference 
of 5000 delegates will discuss the process of perestroika and 
ways of promoting it and will map out measures to further 
democratize the party and society 
perestroika refers to gorbachevs efforts to reform the soviet 
economy and society

workers using cutting torches bulldozers and 
a dog resumed their search today for a workman missing since a 
2000foot television tower collapsed in a heap killing two other 
workers 
the three employees of structural system technology inc of 
mclean va were working to reinforce the tower described as one 
of the nations tallest when it collapsed in calm weather 
thursday authorities said 
the first body was found clear of the wreckage immediately after 
the accident and the second was pulled out about 7 hours later 
said knox county sheriff harold foreman the search for the third 
man was centered in the area where the second body was discovered 
some of the material is solid steel five inches in 
diameter said foreman who added that investigators had no 
indication why the structure fell its quite heavy 
workers searched until about 3 am using a bloodhound and 
were back at the scene at 9 am an investigator for the federal 
occupational safety and health administration was at the site 
the tower which belonged to ktvotv in kirksville was erected 
in september at a cost of 25 million it was twice as tall as 
frances eiffel tower which is 984 feet high 
a fourth worker crew foreman rick walton was on the ground 
when the structure collapsed 
i saw the whole tower coming down said walton who was not 
injured it sounded like the worst thunderstorm you ever heard 
only a hundred times worse 
the structure did not strike any homes in the mainly rural area 
of colony about 200 miles northwest of st louis 
jerry heilman ktvos general manager said the workers had been 
replacing structural braces at about the 500foot level he said 
the station hopes to be back on the air by saturday or sunday using 
its old transmission tower in lancaster 
heilman said he could not comment on why the tower less than a 
year old might have needed reinforcement 
the towers height the maximum permitted under federal aviation 
administration rules increased ktvos potential audience from 
40000 households to about 120000 said kurt sweeney the 
stations news director 
a 1909foot television tower near coweta okla collapsed 
during a severe ice storm dec 26 no one was hurt in that 
collapse which engineers said was caused by 500000 pounds of ice 
on the tower

a special committee of the 17 millionmember 
united church of christ announced today that it will recommend the 
church move its national headquarters from new york to cleveland 
more than a year ago the executive council of the united church 
suggested that headquarters be moved to st louis but changed its 
recommendation and said only that the headquarters be moved out of 
new york by 1991 
the recommendation came a year after the churchs 16th general 
synod delayed selection of a site and decided that a special 
committee should resolve the issue 
the decision wont become final until the churchs next synod in 
fort worth tex in 1989 said public relations coordinator martha 
gotwals 
in a news release today the 12member committee said many 
factors led to the choice of cleveland including the mission of 
the church and its priorities the continuing commitment to 
ecumenical relationship stewardship and cost factors the strong 
and diverse presence of the united church of christ quality of 
life issues and demographics 
the move could mean as many as 310 new jobs for cleveland and 
some members of the new york staff are expected to transfer ms 
gotwals said some of the churchs leases in new york expire in 
1989 she said 
ms gotwals said the church hasnt selected a specific location 
for the new headquarters but that a site will be chosen before the 
synod meets june 29 1989 
the churchs executive council had considered cleveland 
chicago louisville ky indianapolis new york and st louis

jesse jackson called today for immediate 
federal action to stop discrimination against victims of the deadly 
disease aids 
jackson in a campaign statement distributed to reporters 
praised a draft report issued thursday by the chairman of the white 
house aids commission and he said the government should quickly 
heed the reports recommendation of strong federal 
antidiscrimination protection 
the reaganbush administration must act now to stop 
discrimination against people with aids in all areas including 
employment housing and insurance jackson said 
the president must take every available step including an 
executive order to stop discrimination now and the congress must 
legislate strong new laws to protect confidentiality and rights 
we cannot wait to commit more resources he said all 
presidential candidates must agree that we need to spend what is 
necessary to meet the challenge we cannot wait to lead our nation 
away from discrimination and fearmongering all leaders must speak 
out now 
jacksons comments were released just before he left for a 
oneday foray into new mexico and montana today before returning to 
california for the finale of his democratic presidential campaign 
his campaign manager insisted were gaining 
the two small states and new jersey join california in closing 
out the democratic primary season with elections on tuesday 
after spending much of thursday talking to gang members and 
urging local authorities to address the root problems of gang 
violence jackson took his upbeat message to a housing project in 
heavily hispanic east los angeles and then headed to a peace rally 
in los angeles 
along the way he picked up some words of praise but not an 
official endorsement from los angeles mayor tom bradley who said 
he would keep his voting preference in the privacy of the voting 
booth 
jackson appeared relaxed and jovial despite the growing 
inevitability that he will lose the nomination to frontrunner 
michael dukakis 
jacksons campaign manager gerald austin acknowledged thursday 
that jackson faces an uphill battle to win californoas primary on 
tuesday a fact reflected in polls showing dukakis with an 
overwhelming lead in the state 
but austin said he believes jackson has some momentum now 
adding were gaining 
but weve got a long ways to go austin admitted weve 
got our job cut our for us to turn our people out to vote 
that goal has been reflected in jacksons speeches here as he 
tells supporters that their votes do count and that they should not 
be swayed by reports that dukakis all but has the nomination 
wrapped up 
his campaign has begun a 700000 television advertising blitz 
for the final days of the california campaign which will include a 
150000 halfhour broadcast at 8 pm on monday election eve 
the show will be not only an appeal for votes but also a 
closing statement for the campaign that will feature an upbeat 
celebration of the year of campaigning austin said 
it will feature footage of jacksons campaign and an interview 
with the candidate by a yetunnamed celebrity he said jackson 
also will make a closing statement to viewers 
jackson and bradley met privately at city hall and then convened 
a meeting with six gang members and various representatives of city 
and county agencies 
the meeting at city hall was added to jacksons schedule after 
dukakis canceled a scheduled debate in the los angeles suburb of 
torrance because his wife was having delicate spinal surgery today 
bradley said that jacksons meeting with gang members that 
morning in a watts housing project where jackson also had spent 
the night provided one more item of impetus to city efforts 
against gang problems 
i will commit to bring together resources to deal with 
what is an urgent problem in our society and our city the mayor 
said 
without officially endorsing his fellow black politican bradley 
said jackson had run a thoroughly remarkable campaign and had 
energized millions of people across the country 
i commend you for what you have done in showing what is 
possible for this country the mayor told jackson

a 5yearold boy returned to school today 
and resumed shouting bible verses drawing yet another suspension 
on the last day of classes for preaching and refusing to enter 
school 
matthew strode was on campus at eastfield elementary school for 
about 20 minutes before he was suspended said assistant principal 
shirley ramsey 
the boys brother duffey 11 whose own suspension ran through 
today stood outside the school gate joining matthew in his 
preaching 
on thursday school officials had breathed a sigh of relief when 
matthew and his sister failed to return to school after their 
latest 10day suspension 
it was good to have a nice quiet morning david ricketts 
superintendent of mcdowell county schools said thursday 
before today matthew and his sister pepper 6 had been 
suspended four times for defying school authorities and breaking 
school rules by preaching or in peppers case standing outside 
eastfield elementary after being asked to enter the building 
todays suspension on the last day of school was for one day 
the childrens father david strode had said thursday that he 
saw no need to send his children to school because arrangements had 
been made for them to take their final tests today 
my father in heaven will take care of us strode said 
when strode took duffey back to school may 27 there were two 
altercations with protesting parents the parents gave him with a 
petition of 474 signatures calling for him to stop his children 
from preaching 
duffey told reporters thursday he expects to preach somewhere 
during the summer i just like preaching the daily word he 
said 
the children have had enough preaching in two months to fill 
their bellies for a lifetime strode said the people who have 
rejected it have sealed their doom to an everlasting fire 
school officials thursday positioned sheriffs deputies at the 
top of the driveway and instructed parents to drop off their 
children and leave the campus immediately reporters also were 
restricted to certain areas of the grounds 
school officials have said the preaching is in reaction to 
duffeys suspension in april after a scuffle with some other 
children 
i think mr strode had an ax to grind with the school 
system ricketts said he chose this way to do it 
strode has said he is building a house on the west side of town 
so the children probably will go to a different school when classes 
resume in august the strodes claim a constitutional right to 
preach on school grounds

a bomb hidden in a trash bin 
exploded today outside a bank killing four people and injuring 19 
police said it was the deadliest bombing in south africa in more 
than a year 
the lunchhour blast went off at 130 pm outside a branch of 
the standard bank in roodepoort a city bordering the west side of 
johannesburg three black men and a white woman were killed 
the explosion followed four other bombings in the past two weeks 
which authorities have blamed on the african national congress 
guerrilla movement 
the anc had no immediate comment on the bombing but issued a 
statement from its headquarters in lusaka zambia saying the month 
of june must be a period of united and decisive popular 
offensive against the government 
the statement endorsed a threeday antiapartheid protest 
scheduled to start on monday saying south africas economy must 
grind to a halt on those days 
a roodepoort police spokesman maj tiene halgryn said eight 
people were seriously injured in the explosion including two 
whites and six blacks he said 11 other people suffered lesser 
injuries 
police said most of the victims apparently were waiting at a 
street corner for a traffic light to change when the explosion 
occurred 
the blast shattered at least a dozen windows in the bank as 
well as windows in nearby stores and glass was strewn across a 
nearby intersection in roodepoorts central business district 
police said the explosive device was a small limpet mine which can 
be attached to another object and they conducted a search for 
other bombs after cordoning off the area 
a majority of the bombings blamed on the anc have involved 
limpet mines posters in government buildings around the country 
show pictures of these devices and encourage members of the public 
to be on the lookout for them 
the death toll from todays explosion was the highest from a 
bombing in south africa since four white policemen were killed by a 
car bomb outside a johannesburg courthouse in may 1987 
it was the fifth bombing reported in the johannesburgpretoria 
area in a nineday span only one of the other blasts caused 
injuries a mine placed in a flower box in pretoria which exploded 
may 26 injuring four white women 
police have blamed the blasts on the outlawed anc which has 
waged a bombing and sabotage campaign since 1961 as part of its 
efforts to topple the whitecontrolled government the anc has 
neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the recent bombings 
todays anc statement said the group had distributed leaflets in 
south africa endorsing the nationwide protest planned monday 
through wednesday by antiapartheid labor unions church groups and 
other activists 
the groups organizing the protest in south africa are prohibited 
by law from promoting a general strike but it is expected that the 
protest will take that form government officials and employers 
have warned that workers who participate face dismissal or legal 
action 
the protest is intended to oppose the bannings of major 
antiapartheid organizations and other government moves against 
opposition trade unions newspapers and individual activists 
under apartheid south africas 26 million blacks have no vote 
in national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services

an epidemic of a herpes virus has 
killed hundreds of seals in danish and german waters and 
researchers believe it may be linked to pollution 
pollution also may be behind an explosive growth of algea that 
has choked tons of norwegian fish according to researchers 
biologists diagnosed the herpes virus in the dead harp seals on 
wednesday they had been baffled for two weeks by the mysterious 
deaths of seal pups and by spontaneous abortions 
we are relieved that it turned out to be an epidemic but 
worried because there might be environmental causes behind it 
peder agger head of the state forestry and nature agency said 
thursday 
we fear that the seal kill was caused by pollution and if 
that is the case then our picture of generally deplorable 
conditions is backed up agger was quoted as saying in the 
jyllandsposten newspaper 
no source of the pollution has been pinpointed to explain the 
sudden increase in casualties of marine life about 400 dead seals 
have been found in danish waters and another 50 on west germanys 
north sea coastline 
in addition an increasing number of dab fish have been found 
suffering from canker sores up to every fifth dab examined was 
diseased according to the jyllandsposten report 
all signs point to a breakdown in the ecological balance in 
danish waters said jens kampmann head of the environmental 
protection agency 
at a special meeting of the west german parliament wednesday 
environment minister klaus toepfer called for international action 
to help cut waste dumping in the seas because of strong 
suspicions it is threatening marine life 
experts have warned for 10 years of a creeping sea death as 
a result of steadily growing emissions of nitrogen and phosphorus 
from public sewage plants industry and farms along the coast 
the germans are worried that environmental complications may 
lie behind the seal kills and for good reason since there is a 
lot of heavy industry in the area agger said 
kampmann said no certain link has been made between the seal 
epidemic and the blanket of yellow algae that has spread southward 
from the western coasts of norway and sweden toward the baltic 
norwegian farmers who breed salmon and trout in seaside pens 
lost hundreds of tons of fish as the algae clogged the fish gills 
and suffocated them the algae are harmless to humans 
some major fish farms in western norway towed their pens away 
from coastal areas into norways deep cool fiords to avoid the 
threat denmarks rich fishing grounds so far have been unaffected 
norwegian and danish biologists who were dispatched to north sea 
and baltic waters recently reported algae concentrations were 
dropping significantly 
the mass of singlecelled algae was moving toward the baltic 
experts said the upper level of the sea was not salty enough for 
the algae to thrive but they might seek deeper waters and threaten 
marine life on the bottom

a man who looks after the pottery and porcelain in 
the british museum is going to break a prize exhibit the 
2000yearold portland vase from ancient rome 
art dealers estimate the value of the vase at around 21 
million the 10inchhigh fourpound glass artifact is regarded as 
one of the finest pieces of early roman glass 
nigel williams the museums chief conservator of ceramics said 
the vase must be broken and reassembled because the glue holding 
the blue and white cameoglass pieces together after two earlier 
breakages has become yellow and extremely brittle 
it is the most difficult restoration i have attempted in 27 
years williams told reporters at a news conference wednesday 
he said he expects the task to occupy about 40 percent of his 
time for the rest of this year he hopes to have the vase back on 
display by the end of december 
it was made by a sculptor named dioscourides and depicts men and 
women in a leafy glade probably the courtship of peleus and the 
seagoddess thetis who became the parents of the mythical greek 
warrior achilles 
it is one of the very few surviving roman cameo vases and has 
always been the subject of great academic debate as to who is 
represented on it said museum spokesman andrew hamilton 
the vase was formed by inserting a gob of cobalt blue glass into 
a cup of opaque white glass and then blowing both together the 
white outer layer was then carved to produce the white cameo relief 
on a blue background 
the vase is believed to have belonged to the emperor augustus 
and was discovered in 1582 in a tomb near rome 
it came to britain in the 18th century via sir william hamilton 
the british envoy in naples and husband of lady emma hamilton 
later the mistress of adm horatio nelson 
in 1785 the vase was sold to the wealthy portland family for 
roughly the equivalent of 1875 dollars in todays money a vast 
sum in those days the duke of portland loaned it to the british 
museum in 1810 
while on display in a showcase at the museum the vase was 
deliberately smashed into about 200 pieces on feb 7 1845 by 
william lloyd an irishman who had been drinking heavily for a week 
i have no doubt that the man who broke the vase whoever he 
is is mad the duke replied when the museum wrote to him to 
express regret 
the vase was glued together by the museums restorer john 
doubleday and put on display again 
doubledays glue had become so weak and discolored after a 
century that in 1948 the vase was dismantled and rebuilt by 
conservator james axtell who also incorporated three of the 37 
small chips that doubleday had found too difficult to replace 
i will be using more advanced techniques than were available 
to axtell including epoxy resin fused by ultraviolet light said 
williams 
he also intends to replace the 34 glass chips axtell left out 
the vase should hold together comfortably for another 200 
years after that williams said

civilians

lee the prime minister wrote the letter proposing talks to 
premier lee gun mo of north korea chung hanmo the culture and 
information minister read it on radio 
i respectfully propose talks between highlevel authorities of 
south and the north korea to speedily dispel the mistrust that is 
now standing in the way of peaceful unification it said 
south korean officials said they told the north on tuesday they 
would deliver the letter to panmunjom on friday but the north 
koreans refused to receive it 
korea has been divided since in 1945 and there has been a sharp 
rise recently in public support for reunification spurred by 
president roh taewoos promise of full democracy 
radical students have demanded that north korea be made cohost 
of the olympics and that the us troops stationed in south korea 
withdraw they claim the united states is reponsible for partition 
south koreans generally mistrust the north korean regime of kim 
il sung however and support the us military presence they fear 
another north korean invasion like the one in 1950 that started a 
threeyear war 
lees letter said the talks could be held either in seoul or 
pyongyang the north korean capital and should occur at an early 
date preferably within june delegations sides would consist of 
about five officials each and be led by a cabinet minister he said

korea suspended dialogue in the spring of 1986 citing joint 
ussouth korea military exercises 
among topics lee suggested were north korean participation in 
the olympics exchanges of people and reactivating channels of 
dialogue suspended in 1986 
north korea has promoted its own proposal for political talks 
to be attended by 50 politicians from each side south korea has 
called that an unrealistic political offensive 
opposition leaders have urged rohs government to make 
concessions as a means of persuading the north koreans to 
participate in the olympics 
north korea has said it will boycott the games unless it is 
cohost the international olympic committee and south korea 
rejected the demand

local officials are balking at sending a 
woman whose daughter killed three people and wounded seven others 
in a shooting rampage to a national convention for families of 
mentally ill people 
the decision by the delaware county office of mental health has 
upset the local chapter of the alliance for the mentally ill which 
wants 800 to send ruth seegrist to its national gathering in 
boulder colo over the july fourth weekend the alliance is a 
selfhelp group for families of the mentally ill 
mrs seegrists daughter sylvia was convicted in the october 
1985 shootings at springfield mall in this philadelphia suburb 
sylvia seegrist has a history of mental illness 
county mental health director diane bricker said thursday the 
expenditure would be difficult to justify because she believes mrs 
seegrist could afford to pay her own way 
mrs seegrist or anyone else the alliance would want to send 
would have to pass a screening for financial need before the county 
would spend the money ms bricker said 
i have already told my own staff they cant go because the 
system is too impoverished ms bricker said i could name you 
a hundred people who would like to go to that conference many of 
whom are willing to pay their own way 
county ami president joy mccoy claims the county is 
discriminating against mrs seegrist she said mrs seegrists 
finances shouldnt be a factor in the decision 
ms mccoy said philadelphia montgomery and chester counties are 
sending four ami representatives each to the conference

a food and drug administration advisory 
committee concluded today that it does not have enough evidence to 
determine whether a relatively new and popular type of birth 
control pill causes more noncancerous cysts than older 
singledose pills 
however the fdas fertility and maternal health drugs panel 
said it supported the postmarket studies that the agency has 
already instructed the three makers of the new pills to undertake 
dr ridgely c bennett of the fda said the agency will work with 
the companies on those studies and is also planning a larger study 
of the pills involving california medicaid recipients 
the los angeles physician whose chemical observations played a 
major role in prompting todays advisory committee meeting declined 
to comment specifically on the panels action 
but dr james c caillouette said he remains personally 
convinced that the singledose pills are safer than the triphasic 
versions which come in three different colors denoting their 
different dose levels a woman taking such a prescription would 
take one color pill on certain days of the month and the other 
colors on other days 
i still have strong feelings that we have pills that in my 
experience are safer than the multiphasics said caillouette 
technically the multiphasics include some products that mix two 
dosage levels rather than three but caillouette said he is mainly 
concerned with the triphasics rather than the biphasics 
the fda instructed the three companies to conduct socalled 
phase 4 studies in letters sent out last december there is no 
indication when they will be completed 
concern that the multiphasics could be contributing to cysts has 
bubbled to the surface since caillouette noticed a rash of the 
growths on his patients a little over two years ago 
this absolutely blew my mind he said in a recent interview 
i thought something awful was happening to me every time i went 
into an examining room i had a patient with ovarian cyst 
eventually he concluded there must be a connection between the 
outbreak of cysts and the new birth control pills he had been 
prescribing for the women 
sold by three of the six major us pharmaceutical companies 
that make birth control pills the multiphasic pills went on the 
market in 1984 they were not new chemical formulations but rather 
new combinations of existing drugs in various strengths 
caillouette said introduction of the pills was accompanied by an 
aggressive marketing program by 1987 he said nine of every 10 
new birth control prescriptions were for multiphasics 
the rationale given by drug companies for developing the 
multiphasic pills was to minimize any sideeffects by providing the 
lowest total dosage possible consistent with effective birth 
control 
but caillouette who was presenting his views to the fda today 
says he believes the decision was driven by business considerations 
he says the companies patents on the singledose pills were 
about to expire and that less expensive generic versions were 
about to become available he believes the companies were looking 
for products just different enough to win new patents so they could 
push sales of those new products rather than compete with the 
cheaper generics 
representatives for the three companies ortho pharmaceutical 
corp wyeth laboratories inc and syntex corp all denied in 
separate telephone interviews any improprieties and said they were 
cooperating with fdaordered reviews 
studies involving thousands of women have led experts to 
conclude that taking birth control pills actually reduces the 
chances of a woman developing ovarian cysts 
that is why caillouette was so surprised when it dawned on him 
in early 1986 that each of seven patients who had developed cysts 
during the previous four months had been taking multiphasic pills 
when he put them back on singledosage birth control pills he 
said the cysts went away and i thought this is what is 
supposed to happen but something is going on with these phasic 
pills 
caillouette who also is a professor at the university of 
southern california school of medicine presented seven case 
studies during a west coast medical meeting and following my 
presentation physicians got up from the audience and presented an 
additional 11 cases 
he published his findings in a medical journal last summer and 
began getting still more calls and letters from other physicians 
and patients having similar experiences 
caillouette said he now knows of 68 cases in which there is a 
potential link between multiphasic pills and functional cysts

the longtime lover of a lawyer charged with 
beating to death the couples 6yearold ward has suffered brain 
damage from repeated beatings new york newsday reported friday 
prosecutors building a murder case against joel steinberg said 
they doubt they will call hedda nussbaum who lived with steinberg 
for 17 years to testify against him even though she is willing 
the newspaper said 
they are concerned that even if she is capable of appearing in 
court she she would fall under steinbergs influence again the 
newspaper quoted law enforcement sources as saying 
its not clear how she will react when she sees steinberg 
again one source said she believed he had supernatural 
powers 
prosecutors interviewed ms nussbaum last month at a private 
psychiatric hospital 
ms nussbaum who also was arrested but not indicted in the 
death of lisa steinberg has undergone plastic surgery to repair 
the visible damage of repeated beatings 
she did suffer brain damage so far it is limited to her 
being unable to come up with some words when shes talking she 
forgets certain words or names a source close to the case told 
the newspaper 
her attorney barry scheck said recently that his client is 
willing to testify against steinberg but refused to detail what 
she would say scheck declined comment thursday 
steinbergs attorney ira d london said he may call ms 
nussbaum as a witness if she isnt called for the prosecution 
sources also told the newspaper that ms nussbaum 45 probably 
will not be prosecuted for lisas death 
ms nussbaum and steinberg were arrested nov 2 after police 
found lisa unconscious in their greenwich village apartment the 
child died a short time later of a head injury 
a grand jury indicted steinberg 47 on charges of seconddegree 
murder firstdegree manslaughter and two counts of endangering the 
welfare of a minor along with drug and weapon charges he is in

dozens of workers walked past a snoozing 
7foot alligator into a factory before people inside finally 
noticed it through a window and called for help 
no one outside even noticed it was there said steve morgan 
of strombergcarlson corp which makes telephone switching 
equipment in this orlando suburb 
the alligator who either walked from a retention pond neaby or 
from lake mary about two miles away chose a flower bed next to the 
plant entrance for his nap thursday about 600 employees used an 
alternate entrance for about 1 hours while a state wildlife 
officer tried to rope the reptile 
dayton hudson finally roped the beast and taped its mouth shut 
the alligator then was shipped to a trapper who killed it for its 
meat and hide under state regulations an alligator that shows no 
fear of humans is considered a threat and must be destroyed

fingers are snapping but feet are 
staying firmly planted on the ground in nicholasville where police 
are enforcing an ordinance that bans public dancing without a 
license 
i stood there and cried said boots nelson a patron at the 
next door saloon who wasnt allowed to dance when a band played her 
favorite song the band was playing their hearts out but people 
were afraid to tap their feet for fear the law would come in 
handmade no dancing signs were posted in the bar after 
police last week cited owner billy davis for violating the 
ordinance officials said it was apparently the first time the 
ordinance had been enforced 
this is not a point where the city is trying to stop 
dancing police chief carl perkins said friday were living in 
the 80s like everyone else does 
but officials say the ordinance applies to dancing everywhere 
including parking lots and playgrounds 
last weekend some square dancers who wanted to kick up their 
heels to a band playing in a restaurant parking lot were asked to 
refrain 
and three clog dancers who appeared at a city commission budget 
meeting thursday to ask permission to clog next weekend were told 
they would have to wait for a meeting of the full commission later 
this month 
mayor james mason told the cloggers the commission was boxed 
in by the ordinance i think it is sad but we cannot vote on 
it he said 
commissioner joe daugherty said he thought the law was unfair 
and that the commission would vote to change it 
perkins said police have begun enforcing the law in the city of 
10000 people because bars that have live bands may not meet city 
and state fire codes he said the intent of the ordinance was 
safety 
davis is to appear in court june 13

a 20yearold man wounded when a 
babysitter went on a shooting spree said today he talked the woman 
into giving up one of her guns after she broke into his home but 
then she shot him in the chest with another pistol 
philip andrew described for the first time what happened in his 
parents winnetka home when laurie dann burst in two weeks ago after 
she killed one child and wounded five others at a nearby elementary 
school 
andrew spoke at a news conference at highland park hospital 
where he has been a patient since the shooting on may 20 
this was a sick individual you cant make sense of it 
thats how you make sense of it the rest of the people who come 
into my house arent going to be shooting at me it was a freak 
incident andrew said 
when ms dann burst into the andrew home the morning of may 20 
after opening fire at hubbard woods elementary school she told 
andrew and his mother she had been sexually assaulted and had shot 
her assailant 
andrew said he and his mother tried to calm ms dann and 
encouraged her to call the police he said his mother left to warn 
her daughters to stay out of the house and that he persuaded ms 
dann to give him one of her two pistols 
but he said she clung to the other a 32caliber she grew 
fearful that police were approaching suddenly turned and shot him 
in the chest andrew said he staggered out of the house and 
collapsed in the driveway 
later as police surrounded his familys house in the posh 
suburb ms dann killed herself 
although andrew and another of ms danns shooting victims 
remain hospitalized a third victim peter munro 8 was released 
thursday night from highland park hospital said spokeswoman sue 
masaraccia 
police are continuing to investigate ms danns background and 
say that an experimental drug she was using can cause suicidal 
depression and is not approved for sale in this country 
ms dann obtained clomipramine also known as anafrail from a 
canadian pharmacy using a chicago psychiatrists prescription 
winnetka police lt joe sumner said thursday 
blood tests taken in an autopsy on ms dann showed traces of the 
drug used to control some behavior problems 
high dosages of anafrail can cause suicidal depression in some 
patients said dr robert devito a pyschiatrist at loyola 
university medical center in suburban maywood 
however devito said that he didnt think the drug caused ms 
danns behavior it is not a homicidal drug by any means he 
said 
ms dann 30 was seeing dr john griest a psychiatrist in 
madison wis where she once lived he is authorized to dispense 
anafrail on a trial basis but police said he only prescribed 
lithium carbonate a drug commonly used for treatment of 
manicdepressive disorders for ms dann 
griest cannot comment on ms danns case due to doctorpatient 
confidentiality said lauren cnare a spokesman at the madison 
clinic we are involved in clinical trials of anafrail ms 
cnare said 
winnetka police apparently know the psychiatrist who supplied 
ms dann with anafrail but have not yet interviewed him the 
chicago tribune reported today 
officials at the illinois department of professional regulation 
also were investigating how she got the drug spokesman steve 
waters said 
cibageigy corp which makes anafrail has been selling the 
drug outside the united states for the treatment of people 
suffering from obsessivecompulsive disorders company 
spokeswoman gloria martini said 
the drug also is used to check repetitive thoughts of random 
violence she said 
ms dann exhibited various symptoms of the disorder residents 
of an apartment complex in madison where she once lived said she 
often rode the elevator for hours 
tests of the drug are being conducted in the united states with 
government approval on 1300 adult patients at 21 sites around the 
country

the government on friday freed 
seven people including two opposition members of parliament who 
were held in prison without trial for seven months 
the freed legislators were tan seng giaw vice chairman of the 
opposition democratic action party and vethamuthu david a party 
central committee member party member madhavan nair told the 
associated press 
nair who is a state assembly member identified the other five 
as suhaimi said legal adviser to the opposition panmalaysian 
islamic party christian church worker cecilia ng lim chin chin a 
lecturer at a local university and two chinese educators lim fong 
seng and seng maw yu 
the seven were among 109 people detained in october and november 
of 1987 under the federal internal security act which allows the 
government to imprison people indefinitely without bringing them to 
trial 
the 109 were taken into custody after prime minister mahathir 
mohamad accused them of raising issues that could stir racial 
tensions 
the government cited the same reason for closing the 
englishlanguage star daily newspaper the chineselanguage sin 
chew jit poh daily and the malay biweekly watan in october 1987 
they were allowed to reopen earlier this year 
the prime minister said at the time that he wanted to prevent 
riots between malays and chinese such as those in 1969 that left 
500 people dead about 50 percent of the population is malay and 30 
percent chinese 
the government began releasing some of the 109 detainees on nov 
20 1987 no reason was given for the latest release which left 
about 30 of the original 109 still in prison 
during past releases the government has said the detainees it 
was freeing no longer posed a threat to national security

a decision by the ywcas tacoma chapter to 
hire a male executive director in defiance of national organization 
rules has set off debate over the future of the 133yearold 
organization 
last month alan tiger 36 of eugene ore was hired as 
executive director by definition an executive director must be a 
full voting member of the ywca but the organizations constitution 
allows men only as associate nonvoting members 
tigers hiring could result in the national organization 
terminating its affiliation with the tacoma chapter and the 
decision will set a precedent for the ywca said marilynne keyser 
a ywca national board member 
on thursday she and national executive director gwendolyn 
calvert baker fly to tacoma to meet with chapter leaders to discuss 
the issue 
i think this is pure conjecture that the national has 
simply lost touch with whats happening on a local level said 
pene modahl president of the tacoma board of directors 
we believe here in tacoma that men and women can work 
together we dont believe were going to lose our focus by hiring 
the best possible candidate who happened to be a man she said 
tiger said the tacoma ywca will remain committed to the battered 
womens shelter the job training programs and the other services 
aimed primarily at women 
we have to ask ourselves when in the womens movement do we 
stop talking about men and women and start to talk about 
humanity he said 
however some members say accepting men as full members may 
shift the ywcas focus away from womens concerns 
we are working to reverse previous years of discrimination we 
are an organization to promote women and provide a place for women 
to learn to be powerful said barbara dixon executive secretary 
of the salem ore ywca in that chapter five of 35 board members 
quit in may when the board denied membership to a man 
while the ymca focuses on health and fitness and allows both 
sexes to join the ywca plays largely a social service and 
political role ms keyser said 
she said the tacoma chapters action is sure to be a subject of 
debate at the national ywca convention later this month in chicago 
we believe there is a need to reaffirm the commitment as an 
autonomous womens organization ms keyser said 
some members say many of the 400 local chapters are under 
pressure to allow men to join partly because of the recent 
inclusion of women in formerly allmale clubs such as rotary 
to me its a natural evolution its come to a point in the 
1980s that we have to lay aside this usagainstthem thing and 
start to work together said gay littleton executive director of 
the ogden utah ywca 
a few months ago the ogden chapter became the first in the 
country to be disaffiliated from the national group because it 
allowed men to join disaffiliation means the ogden group may be 
barred from using the ywca name or symbol no final decision on 
that issue has been made said ms littleton

mayor w wilson goode today named deputy 
commissioner willie williams as the citys new police commissioner 
putting him in charge of a department still recovering from 
corruption probes and a confrontation with a radical group 
williams the first black to lead the 6700 member department 
will replace kevin tucker who resigned last week after 2 years on 
the job 
williams 44 has been a police officer for 24 years starting 
his career as a fairmount park guard goode said he chose williams 
from among seven candidates suggested by tucker 
the tenure of kevin tucker has represented the turningaround 
of this department and the appointment of willie williams 
represents a continuation of the reform of the department goode 
said at a noon news conference 
there has been speculation that because of budget cuts there 
would be some layoffs in the police department and williams told 
reporters the patrol force on the street will not be cut that is 
our first priority 
both williams and goode said the major task facing the police 
department is the fight against drugs 
tucker 47 quit may 26 effective june 10 citing a need to 
spend more time with his family tucker is former head of the local 
secret service office 
tucker took over a moraleshattered department reeling from 
extortion convictions against 34 officers or former officers 
including a deputy commissioner 
tucker succeeded gregore sambor who resigned after a fatal may 
1985 confrontation between police and move in which the radical 
groups building was bombed by a police helicopter the bombing 
sparked a fire that destroyed dozens of houses 
goode has praised tuckers work as commissioner saying he 
turned the department around and it is now going in the right 
direction the job of the next police commissioner will be made 
much easier by the job he has done 
goode asked if appointing a black police commissioner would 
help the image of police in the black community responded that 
race was never a factor in this appointment i only sought to 
find the very best person 
he said however that williams will be able to turn around 
negative views of police in the black community which comprises 
about 40 percent of the citys population

a 12yearold girl staged a second 
sitdown strike to protest little league orders that she move up to 
a higher league but tearfully gave up her spot on the pitchers 
mound when threatened with arrest 
as 100 spectators watched felicia lewis wearing the uniform of 
the allingtown volunteer fire department was led away by her 
parents after local police warned she would be charged with 
disturbing the peace if she didnt let the allgirls softball game 
resume 
west haven little league officials reiterated tuesday that 
felicia must move up because she is too old and talented for the 
allingtown volunteer fire department team where she was assigned 
in april at the beginning of her rookie season 
felicia who forced cancellation of a game last week with a 
similar protest says she wants to stay on the allingtown team 
which is made up of 8 to 12yearolds because she has made 
friends 
i like my team i want to play she said thursday 
felicia arrived at the morse park ballfield shortly before 
allingtowns game against brian place and was greeted by television 
crews and a large crowd of parents and children 
she went to the outfield to shag a few flies with teammates 
before the game and went out to the mound and sat down soon after 
the game began 
league officials were prepared for the protest and submitted a 
written complaint to police who ordered felicia off the field and 
the game was resumed 
felicia was drafted by a team in a higher league because she was

president junius r jayewardenes 
party was declared the winner friday in two regional elections 
marred by violence and sinhalese extremists killed two candidates 
in another election scheduled next week 
india moved 2000 more troops to mullaitivu a port town in 
northeastern sri lanka in a 12dayold campaign against tamil 
rebel hideouts military officials said 
the elections were required under an agreement that india and 
sri lanka signed last july in hopes of ending a tamil separatist 
war that has taken about 8000 lives since 1983 india has more 
than 50000 soldiers in sri lanka to enforce the pact which the 
largest rebel group rejected 
extremists in the sinhalese ethnic majority say the agreement 
makes too many concessions to tamils and have vowed to kill anyone 
who supports it 
jayewardenes united national party won 87 of the 158 seats at 
stake in elections thursday for district councils in western and 
central regions the government election department said 
a threeparty communist alliance won 60 seats the moslem 
congress nine and the liberal party two it reported 
sinhalese extremists killed two candidates for the the district 
council election scheduled for next thursdy in the southern region 
of this tea and spice island off the tip of india 
one represented jayewardenes party and the other was from the 
communist alliance police said 
authorities also blamed sinhalese radicals for at least 75 cases 
of arson in the southern province including five fires set at 
government buildings and around telephone and electricity poles 
at least six people were reported killed wednesday and thursday 
among them two policemen and an election worker 
the attacks are blamed on the peoples liberation front a 
radical sinhalese group that has gained strength in southern sri 
lanka in the past several years 
also friday the united news of india said the indian government 
reported 18 indian soldiers killed last sunday when tamil fighters 
detonated a mine under their truck 
it said the report of the bombing one of the deadliest attacks 
on indian forces apparently was withheld because of a threeday 
visit to sri lanka by defense minister kc pant that ended tuesday 
nine district councils are to be created under the peace 
agreement and the government party won elections for four held in 
april no election dates have been set in the tamildominated north 
and east because of the insurgency 
tamils most of whom are hindus make up 18 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million people and claim discrimination by the 
predominantly buddhist sinhalese majority 
india became involved in trying to end the war because 60 
million tamils live in its southern tamil nadu state 
the main target of the indian military campaign is the 
liberation tigers of tamil eelam which is the largest rebel group 
and has not put down its arms 
at least 480 indian soldiers have been killed since their 
peacekeeping mission began july 30 1987

surgeons operated for more than five hours today 
to relieve dangerous pressure on the spinal column of kitty 
dukakis wife of democratic presidential frontrunner michael 
dukakis who canceled campaign plans to be with her at the hospital 
preliminary indications look good hospital spokesman martin 
bander said after the surgery 
dukakis spent the night on an extra bed in his wifes room 
according to spokesman james dorsey he spent about 15 minutes this 
morning talking to the chief surgeon dr nicholas t zervas 
before the operation began at 730 am edt 
the governor is going to spend the morning at the hospital 
working said dorsey he is going to await the results 
dukakis flew from san francisco to boston on thursday to be with 
mrs dukakis doctors intended to remove two herniated discs 
pressing against her spinal cord in her neck they expected the 
operation to last from two to five hours 
kittys feeling fine dukakis told reporters after the 
latenight visit shes in good spirits looks good and is 
anxious to get this over 
the massachusetts governor said he would resume campaigning this 
weekend if everything is ok 
dukakis said his wife was satisfied the diagnosis explained the 
puzzling health problems she had been experiencing mrs dukakis 
had complained of numbness and coldness in her fingers and hands 
and pain in her neck for about a month 
when she went out walking she would kind of stumble a little 
bit he said so in a sense its a relief to know this is what 
it is 
she started by having this feeling of numbness in her 
fingertips it started spreading to her feet and now its getting 
to her legs its obvious these herniated discs are starting to 
press on whatever it is theyre pressing on he said 
dukakis canceled a planned debate with democratic rival jesse 
jackson which was to have been the last of the primary campaign 
and flew home little more than 12 hours after arriving on the west 
coast 
doctors had decided thursday to go ahead with immediate surgery 
after analyzing results of tests performed on mrs dukakis 
my impression is that when you have anything that involves the 
spinal cord the faster you move on it the better dukakis said 
in an interview 
led by zervas chief of neurosurgery at the hospital surgeons 
planned to take a bone graft from mrs dukakiss hip and use it to 
replace a portion of the discs 
the plan is to remove the discs compressing on the spinal 
cord the bone graft taken from the hip will be split and fused 
into the vertabrae to replace the two areas from which the discs 
will be removed hospital spokesman martin bander said 
mrs dukakis underwent sophisticated tests including magnetic 
resonance imaging while in los angeles last saturday and had more 
tests upon returning to massachusetts on wednesday 
zervas said surgery was scheduled quickly because of the 
worsening of the condition 
dukakis left san francisco after attending only one public 
event a talk with gradeschool students about the environment on a 
city beach 
he said he regretted having to cancel campaign appearances but 
this is obviously the most important thing he said he hoped to 
resume campaigning over the weekend if the surgery goes well 
both dukakis and jackson were campaigning toward the june 7 
primaries in california new jersey montana and new mexico

a middleaged woman spit and cursed at 
a drawing of officers who served germanys third reich a european 
man threw a beer mug to the floor apparently enraged by the 
decorations of bangkoks nazi bar 
trendy thais are frequenting the new nightspot but foreigners 
have objected to the caricatures of adolf hitler cartoons of 
italian fascist leader benito mussolini photos of storm troopers 
and waiters with swastika armbands 
for us the bar is purely businessoriented apolitical 
artistic and entertaining said manager aor saratuk 
he said he and business partners focused on the nazi theme 
because its powerful catchy name and emotive appeal would draw 
young patrons in a downtown area dotted with competitive pubs with 
names such as express or studio west 
they flock to the bar to hear live music seemingly oblivious to 
objections that it glamorizes the brutal nazi regime 
aor said there have been no complaints by thais but in recent 
weeks several foreigners have criticized the bar in letters to the 
englishlanguage bangkok post newspaper 
simply stated opening a bar that glamorizes any aspect of 
adolf hitler or the nazi regime is an offense against our common 
humanity if we can easily forget or trivialize the holocaust then 
we are saying that human life is not sacred one letter said 
thongbai thongpao thailands leading human rights lawyer said 
the management may not knowingly endorse nazi germany but the 
bars name has had the unfortunate effect of hurting other 
peoples feelings because of memories evoked by the holocaust 
atrocity 
about 6 million european jews were systematically exterminated 
by nazi germany during the holocaust 
but not everyone finds the bar offensive 
jeanpaul lorbach a tourist from brussels belgium said 
its very pleasing here just like any other bar its definitely 
not nazism 
a former thai policeman 25yearold boonserm jitarasomkuan 
called hitler a notorious criminal but advised the management 
to keep the name because he said it was harmless 
aor called some of the bars decor deliberate distortions of 
nazism a 10foot portrait of hitler reviewing troops in a trench 
coat shows his moustache turned upwards and elongated not the way 
he wore it one color drawing depicted him in a straightjacket and 
was captioned captured german painting

democrat michael dukakis spent the morning in the hospital as 
his wife kitty underwent delicate spinal surgery vice president 
george bush arrived back in washington from his summer home and 
immediately went to visit cancerstricken salvadoran president jose 
napoleon duarte at an area hospital 
the surgery on mrs dukakis was begun early today and completed 
in the afternoon preliminary indications look good said 
martin bander a spokesman for massachusetts general hospital in 
boston 
bush was to welcome president reagan back from his moscow summit 
trip late today 
before taking a helicopter to walter reed army medical center 
bush said of duarte i plan to wish him well and share our 
countrys appreciation for all hes done for democracy 
bush returning to washington today after a week of strategy 
talks at his summer home said he was convinced his campaign is 
on the right track despite a rash of recent surveys suggesting 
he trails dukakis the democratic frontrunner 
im not going to be stampeded by polls that dont mean 
anything the vice president told reporters on thursday as he 
was preparing to leave his oceanside retreat at kennebunkport 
maine 
meanwhile a poll in california gave dukakis a substantial lead 
over jackson his only remaining rival in tuesdays primary but 
it suggested jackson who has campaigned heavily in the state was 
gaining ground 
dukakis cut short a california campaign swing on thursday after 
his wifes doctors decided to perform urgent surgery on 
herniated discs pressing dangerously on mrs dukakis spinal cord 
dukakis who was spending the night at the hospital visited his 
wife late thursday night and told reporters afterward shes in 
good spirits looks good and is anxious to get this over with 
the governor said he hoped to resume campaigning this weekend if 
the surgery went well 
jackson was campaigning today in new mexico and montana whose 
primaries on tuesday have been largely overshadowed by big sameday 
contests in new jersey and california the four races with a total 
of 466 delegates at stake close out the democratic primary season 
and offer dukakis a chance to clinch the nomiantion 
of the 2081 delegates needed to nominate the massachusetts 
governor has nearly 1800 jackson trails with fewer than 1000 
in california a poll conducted for the san francisco examiner 
and san francisco television station kron indicated dukakis led 
jackson by 24 percentage points 52 percent to 28 percent in a 
similar survey two weeks ago he led by 37 points 
the poll for which 600 registered democratic voters were 
questioned on tuesday and wednesday has a margin of error of 4 
percentage points the examiner said in thursdays editions 
jackson was expressing hopes that a debate with dukakis could be 
arranged before tuesdays primary the two democrats had been 
scheduled to debate thursday afternoon in california but dukakis 
canceled out after his wifes doctors said they wanted to operate 
without delay 
my impression is that when you have anything that involves the 
spinal cord the faster you move on it the better dukakis said 
as he was flying home thursday night 
bush meanwhile was returning to washington today in time to 
greet president reagan who will be back from tonight from the 
superpower summit 
some bush supporters eyeing a series of publicopinion surveys 
last month that gave dukakis doubledigit leads have been urging 
bush to try to set himself apart from reagan on a few issues 
bush has edged away from the president on a matters such as 
panamas gen manuel antonio noriega under indictment on drug 
charges and attorney general edwin meese iii under investigation 
by an independent counsel but he has refrained from any dramatic 
breaks with the president 
weve got a game plan weve staying with it he said 
youre not going to see any drastic change in campaign plans 
on thursday he was asked about reagans suggestion that soviet 
reluctance to issue exit visas stems from bureaucratic problems 
rather than kremlin policy 
bush sidestepped the question but he went on to criticize 
soviet human rights policy in stronger terms than the president has 
used 
i think we have very different views on human rights than the 
soviet union he said i would suggest that soviet retaliation 
against us saying weve got human rights problems is mixing 
apples and oranges 
the vice president added weve got some problems but theyre 
not problems of human rights 
still he hailed reagan for raising human rights issues saying 
i think the soviet union should adhere to these high standards 
the president is talking about 
dukakis too made a point of praising reagan for bringing up 
human rights during the summit trip 
we take pride in the message of freedom and human rights that 
president reagan brought with him to moscow the democratic 
candidate said in a statement issued by his campaign

violation of its commitment to guarantee freedom of expression 
spokeswoman phyllis oakley said the suspensions announced 
wednesday will prevent the programs from being broadcast through 
the next round of ceasefire talks with nicaraguan rebel leaders 
set for next week 
this is probably not coincidental mrs oakley said adding 
that the suspensions violated commitments to free expression the 
leftist government made in one agreement signed last august and 
another two months ago 
restrictions like this can only damage the process of 
establishing peace and democracy in nicaragua mrs oakley said

former congressman sam steiger convicted 
of pressuring a parole board member while working for thengov 
evan mecham was sentenced today to four years probation 
judge ronald reinstein of maricopa county superior court also 
fined steiger 5480 and sentenced him to perform 700 hours of 
community service work he suggested that steiger well known for 
criticizing lawyers consider doing volunteer work for the arizona 
bar association 
reinsteins sentencing options ranged from probation to five 
years in prison 
assistant attorney general michael cudahy had urged that the 
judge consider giving steiger jail time to impress upon him the 
seriousness of the crime and to deter others but a probation 
officer recommended no jail and the judge agreed saying he did not 
think it would do steiger any good 
and cudahy said after the sentencing he had no problem with 
steiger being put on probation 
steiger repeated his contention that he was singled out for 
prosecution because he had been critical of attorney general bob 
corbin he said he was not remorseful even though prejudice and 
precedence would dictate that i should be remorseful 
reinstein said he was impressed by the outpouring of more than 
170 letters on steigers behalf and did not believe that steiger 
was motivated by political or personal gain 
but he said steiger clearly broke the law abused his power 
and was trying to deflect your obvious wrong in this case on 
others he told steiger one of the main reasons for the conviction 
was that frankly mr steiger you came off as a bully 
steiger 59 was convicted april 7 of theft by extortion for 
threatening board of pardons and paroles member ron johnson over a 
personnel vote 
steiger claimed it was simply hardball politics but cudahy said 
steiger threatened johnsons parttime job as a justice of the 
peace in order to steal his vote on retention of the boards 
executive director 
steiger as congressman rancher and newspaper columnist has 
taken on his colleagues neighbors business associates former 
wife police and highway officials in a colorfull career 
he was 28 and a republican when he ran for the state senate from 
a 101 democratic district and won the first of two terms 
steiger spent 10 years in congress as a republican before he 
made a losing bid for a us senate seat he ran for the 
governorship on the libertarian ticket in 1982 
about a year ago in the prescott sun he repeated some of his 
favorite advice 
shun lawyers ignore lawyers but above all do not elect them 
to public office he said lawyers are the running sores of the 
20th century and if they are not isolated and done away with as 
humanely as instinct will permit they will be the cause of the 
downfall of this culture

lawyers defending three tobacco companies 
against liability charges ended their cases by claiming that 
smoking doesnt cause cancer and cigarette makers researched the 
issue enough to fulfill their corporate responsibility 
the judge in the case today granted a delay in closing arguments 
to an attorney for the man suing the companies over his wifes 
lungcancer death 
the company lawyers closing arguments mainly centered on the 
will and motives of rose cipollone a 58yearold woman who died of 
lung cancer in 1984 her husband antonio is seeking damages from 
the companies that made the cigarettes she smoked for 40 years 
mrs cipollone made a decision you and i make every day of our 
lives to do or not to do something that is risky philip 
morris co attorney peter k bleakley told the us district court 
jury thursday 
bleakley also defended industry research efforts as legitimate 
and worthy 
attorney marc z edell representing cipollone said he needed 
more time to prepare his closing arguments which had been 
scheduled for today 
us district judge h lee sarokin also said he will grant the 
extraordinary remedy of a halfhour of rebuttal to each company 
after edell makes his arguments monday he said the companies felt 
edells delay would prejudice the jury against them 
the judge said he expected the case to go to the jury tuesday 
cipollone claims the industrys research was inadequate and 
partly an attempt to deflect health critics and that advertising 
and public relations were used to muddle the issue all as part of 
an effort to mislead the public 
on thursday the second day of summations in the fourmonth 
trial bleakley continued the theme of the lawyers for lorillard 
inc and liggett group inc who preceded him that mrs cipollone 
was an intelligent strongwilled woman who knew the risks and 
chose to smoke out of pleasure 
people have been claiming that smoking is bad for you that 
its bad for your health that it kills you as long as these 
products have been on the market he told the jury people do 
things all the time they know to be risky 
cigarette ads have nothing to do with undermining that 
knowledge bleakley argued 
enjoyment of tobacco predates advertising by several hundred 
years he said attacking cipollones contention that ads kept 
his wife hooked on cigarettes 
the companies presented evidence to support their contention 
that mrs cipollone was intelligent knew of smokings risks 
through newspaper articles and the warnings of relatives and made a 
strongwilled choice to smoke 
bleakley lorillard attorney robert northrip and liggett 
attorney donald j cohn referred to testimony by relatives that 
mrs cipollones husband constantly told her to stop smoking that 
her mother blamed cigarettes for her fathers death when mrs 
cipollone was a child and that two sisters called cigarettes 
coffin nails as youths 
bleakley defended the council for tobacco research formed and 
funded by the tobacco companies to study the health effects of 
smoking 
he said no evidence showed the scientists on the councils 
advisory panel were anything but reputable and disinterested and 
that the companies had fulfilled their research responsibility 
through the council 
the cigarette companies still maintain that there is no proof 
that cigarettes directly cause cancer 
northrip also focused on medical testimony by physicians who 
treated mrs cipollone pathologists who studied her cancer and 
cancer experts 
he said physicians disagreed over what kind of lung cancer 
killed mrs cipollone 
some kinds are statistically associated with cigarette 
smoking small cell carcinoma some are not carcinoid or 
atypical carcinoid said northrip 
cipollones experts said mrs cipollone had small cell 
carcinoma and argued that atypical carcinoid also results from 
smoking

groups supported by libya are the prime 
suspects in a spate of recent attacks against americans and us 
facilities around the world a state department spokeswoman said 
friday 
there has been an upsurge in recent weeks of terrorist attacks 
against us and other western european interests in europe latin 
america and africa spokeswoman phyllis oakley said although 
these incidents are still under investigation in numerous cases 
the prime suspects are groups which have received support from 
libya 
the suspicion she said is accompanied by concrete evidence 
including the seizure of libyan arms destined for the ira irish 
republican army and the arrest in senegal of libyan operatives 
that libya continues its support of terrorism 
mrs oakley referred to reports that a weapons shipment 
intercepted by france last november was bound for the outlawed ira 
and that suspected libyan agents were arrested carrying bombmaking 
materials in senegal in february 
for years libya has been one of less than a halfdozen 
countries on a list of nations identified by the state department 
as sponsors of terrorist groups the reagan administration has 
accused libyan leader moammar gadhafi of fomenting terrorism and in 
april 1986 us warplanes attacked his personal living quarters in 
tripoli he was not hit 
around the second anniversary of the attack there were several 
terrorist attacks on installations and clubs owned or frequented by 
americans 
among the targets hit this year were us information agency 
offices in costa rica colombia and peru and the bombing of a club 
frequented by american servicemen in naples italy five people 
were killed in the naples attack two americans were wounded in an 
attack on a club in khartoum sudan in midmay and the office of a 
us bank in new delhi was also a target 
mrs oakley stopped short of directly accusing libya in the 
attacks and us officials have been quoted as saying there is no 
smoking gun to prove gadhafis involvement 
we want to make sure that when we make statements about this 
that they correspond absolutely with the facts and the evidence 
that we have mrs oakley said 
a state department official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said it is widely believed that libya is the headquarters for an 
organization led by abu nidal a palestinian accused of terrorism 
who was expelled last year from syria 
the department has blamed abu nidal for the december 1985 
attacks that killed more than 20 people at the rome and vienna 
airports

attorney allen w johnson had asked a richmond county state 
court judge to dismiss misdemeanor traffic charges on grounds of 
diplomatic immunity but he said thursday he would withdraw the 
motion 
mrs brown 38 was charged with driving under the influence of 
drugs speeding and criminal trespass last september she pleaded 
innocent and the case is expected to go to trial later this month 
rep douglas barnard dga said two years ago on james brown 
appreciation day in augusta near browns home on beech island 
sc james is indeed our no 1 ambassador 
johnson said he asked for diplomatic immunity for the singers 
wife only because every possible defense had to be explored he 
said he has since determined that barnard intended his comments as 
a figure of speech 
diplomatic immunity shields officials of foreign nations from 
criminal charges while they represent their countries in the united 
states

tass the official news agency said 43 broadcast journalists 
from the united states britain france japan and other countries 
were invited today to the sarny military base in the western 
ukraine to observe how ss20 transports and launchers will be 
eliminated 
a detachment of soviet soldiers under col yevgeny kozlov gave a

unemployment increased for the first time this 
year to 56 percent in may the labor department said friday but 
both government officials and private economists cautioned that the 
job figures for last month are too unreliable to suggest that the 
economy is losing steam 
the 02 percentage point increase from aprils 14yearlow 
civilian jobless rate of 54 percent reflected a seasonally 
adjusted shrinking of the us labor force by 363000 people with 
536000 fewer americans at work 
but before the seasonal adjustments made in the governments 
household survey to reflect an historically burgeoning job market 
in may with the end of school terms the actual number of people 
working increased by 317000 
a separate government survey of employer payrolls also showed 
209000 new jobs in may down from an average net gain of 250000 
new jobs monthly over the past year but reflecting a stilltight 
labor market 
janet l norwood commissioner of the bureau of labor 
statistics said it would be premature to draw any conclusions from 
the may change in the jobless rate based on her agencys household 
survey 
the unadjusted increase in may employment was very low by 
historical standards particularly when compared with a 13 million 
rise the same month a year ago ms norwood told the congressional 
joint economic committee 
in past years when may employment growth has been relatively 
weak substantial expansions generally occurred in june or july 
she said at this time of the year its more appropriate to 
focus on the business survey which shows continued although 
somewhat slower growth than previously 
private economists agreed and some even suggested that the 
unemployment rate may still be on a downward trend despite the 
slight increase in may 
you really cant identify a 02 percentage point move as a 
change in the trend said chris caton an analyst for data 
resources inc of lexington mass next month it will probably go 
down a tenth of a percent 
donald straszheim chief economist for merrill lynch said the 
april and may figures together indicate an economy that is still 
growing strongly 
there is nothing in this report that will convince people that 
the economy is slowing appreciably or that inflation and interest 
rates are not on the rise he said 
he predicted the unemployment rate will dip below aprils 54 
percent by years end 
the governments survey of employer payrolls shows manufacturing 
jobs growing by 16000 in may after an increase of 45000 in april 
construction employment fell by 16000 following a rise of 157000 
from january through april 
the 02 percentage point drop in aprils jobless rate to the 
lowest it had been since june 1974 had been propelled largely by 
assembly line hiring by factories trying to keep with a surging 
foreign demand for us products 
ms norwood called mays 16000 new factory jobs no real 
change but she said both the machinery and metal products 
industries continued to register higher employment 
the two exportinfluenced industries have paced the gains in 
manufacturing over the last year along with electrical equipment 
printing and publishing chemicals and rubber and plastic 
products she said 
accompanying the resurgence in exportled manufacturing is a 
strong growth in wholesale trade over the past year wholesale 
trade employment most of it in durable goods distribution has 
increased by 275000 including a 25000 gain last month 
trying to read through the murkiness the figures are telling 
us pretty much what we already know about the economy said 
charles renfro chief economist for alphametrics a consulting frim 
in bala cynwyd pa its cooling off a little bit on the domestic 
front but is still very strong on exports 
the biggest area of job growth last month was health services 
with 35000 new jobs a reflection of the fact that the american 
population is gradually aging in the last year the health care 
industry has expanded by 380000 workers a trend that is expected 
to continue 
however other areas of the service economy are slowing new 
employment in business services such as data processing for 
example has fallen to an average monthly pace of 15000 this year 
compared with 35000 to 40000 new jobs every month in 1987 
finance which includes banks brokerage houses and mortage 
companies had been one of the strongest areas of job growth 
through much of the past six years of economic expansion but has 
lost a total of 10000 jobs since january

the speciallabel treaty beer designed to 
raise money to fight indian treaty rights has been dropped by a 
second brewery 
opponents have called it hate and prejudice in a can 
in as much as its not our label not our message we did not 
want to be put in the middle between two factions kenneth 
lichtendahl president of hudepohlschoenling brewing co in 
cincinnati said in a telephone interview friday 
the brewery was the second within a year to quit making the beer 
for stop treaty abuse inc a group opposed to indian treaty rights 
founded by dean crist a minocqua pizza parlor owner hibernia 
brewing ltd of eau claire which made the beer when it was 
introduced last summer cited similar controversy when it stopped 
after about a month 
treaty rights have become controversial in several states where 
sportsfishermen and other outdoorsmen oppose tribes exercises of 
hunting fishing gathering and water rights retained under federal 
treaties opponents have argued it is unfair to allow the indians 
to use methods or seasons prohibited others and that the exercise 
of treaty rights may harm or deplete natural resources 
crist said friday that treaty beers future was uncertain and 
blamed poor sales in wisconsin and pressure on distributors in 
washington state not to carry the brew 
crist said he had no hard feeling toward hudepohlschoenling 
which had filled about 2000 cases of stas cans with beer that was 
sent for sale to wisconsin 
the brewery and sta had a contract that would have expired 
around the first of the year but reached an agreement to terminate 
it early because of the controversy and low sales volume crist 
said 
the beer which featured a speared fish and the slogan true 
brew of the working man on the label had been the focus of 
outcries in wisconsin washington and idaho 
sharon metz executive director of the milwaukeebased lutheran 
human relations association of america applauded the brewerys 
decision and said friday she believed many of the people who wrote 
the brewery to oppose the beer were responding to her groups 
nationwide boycott call of the beer and the brewery 
in washington where the beer had been scheduled to go on sale 
last month but never did gov booth gardner criticized the beer 
and opponents of the brew had called it hate and prejudice in a 
can 
in idaho the president of the northwest coalition against 
malicious harassment had denounced the beer and its planned sales 
in other western states 
i negotiated a multimilliondollar contract with the brewery 
and whereas they tolerated an enomorous amount of unjust criticism 
the volume just never materialized crist said 
he said he was disheartened by northern wisconsin store resort 
and tavern owners who complain loudly about the chippewa indians 
rights to spear fish but did not actively support the product and 
promote sales

an aging foulsmelling syrian freighter 
anchored in this northern italian port is at the center of a storm 
over the dumping of chemical wastes 
caught in the middle are 18 crewmen who have been stuck aboard 
the ship for four months with 2100 tons of unidentified toxic 
wastes 
six crew members from the cargo carrier zanoobia known in italy 
as the ship of poison have been hospitalized other crewmen 
say they only dream of getting paid and leaving the zanoobia 
we have been aboard for about four months breathing the fumes 
and the bad smell from the leaking drums the zanoobias captain 
ahmed tabalo said wednesday 
we all are weakened depressed we are only thinking of 
returning home even at the cost of leaving the ship and all our 
belongings here tabalo said 
francesco rizzuto a lawyer for tabalo shipping the owner of 
the freighter called the zanoobia the tip of an iceberg of 
illegal shipping of industrial wastes all around the world 
the waste on board the zanoobia has been rejected by djibouti 
venezuela greece and syria 
controversy over the ship and the cargo that nobody wants has 
raised questions about whether industrialized nations are using 
third world countries to dispose of their wastes 
some italian lawmakers have alleged in the european parliament 
that a group of us companies offered 120 million annually to 
dump about 3 million tons of industrial waste a year for five years 
in guinea bissau in west africa 
a joint statement issued thursday by libya and nigeria denounced 
agreements to bury nuclear and industrial wastes in africa as a 
criminal and immoral act and urged african governments to bar 
it 
during a visit to the ship by a reporter liquid leaked from 
some of the 12000 drums of waste and crew members put sawdust on 
the deck of the hold to keep it dry the drums were secured in the 
hold with frayed ropes which posed risks in rough seas tabalo 
said 
the cargos odyssey began in february 1987 when the waste from 
italian manufacturers left the italian port of marina di carrara on 
a maltese freighter for djibouti in east africa djibouti officials 
refused to accept the waste 
it then went to venezuela where it was unloaded but residents 
raised a protest and a boy reportedly died after playing near a 
leaking drum so the waste was put aboard a cypriot freighter 
there was no independent confirmation of the boys death 
the freighter took the cargo to syria where port authorities 
ordered it out claiming it might be contaminated by radioactivity 
it was transferred to the zanoobia 
the zanoobia and its crew of 16 syrians and two lebanese brought 
the waste back to italy the freighter was allowed to dock in genoa 
on sunday after being anchored off marina di carrara for a month 
the cargo will now be unloaded and disposed of in italy a job 
that could take up to two months according to port officials in 
geneva no date has been set for the unloading to begin 
genoa health and port officials who have been monitoring air 
and water around the ship lowered four guinea pigs into the hold 
to test the toxic level they said a test of 40 drums did not turn 
up signs of radioactivity 
five zanoobia crewmen were hospitalized in carrara but were 
later released rizzuto said friday that a crewmen remains in a 
genoa hospital suffering from nausea and stomach pains no results 
have been released from their medical examinations he said 
the italian government has appropriated 33 million to 
incinerate the waste the money will be repaid by jelly wax the 
milan firm contracted to dispose of the chemicals 
a genoa judge marco devoto announced he has opened an 
investigation into the activities of jelly wax rizzuto contends 
that jelly wax has sent at least five other cargos of industrial 
waste to unidentified destinations this year 
the firm has refused comment on the case

the city commission did not intend to 
offend the tobacco industry when it voted to approve a smoking ban 
in cityowned buildings a member who wants the policy rescinded 
said 
although the restrictions were small we wouldnt want them to 
mushroom said commissioner jack ross who had originally voted 
for the policy when it was approved last month 
the policy which took effect wednesday bans smoking in the 
main lobby of city hall city commission chambers the city bus 
station and a handful of other public places 
it has drawn protest from the pinkerton tobacco co daviess 
countys largest industrial employer which contends the ban 
reflects a poor attitude toward tobacco in the city the company 
said it will reconsider its plans to expand the plant which 
employs more than 500 
mayor david adkisson who opposes a move to rescind the policy 
said it will not harm the tobacco industry and that he had heard no 
one in town voicing opposition to it before it passed 
people will continue to make money from tobacco he said 
when a police officer writes a speeding ticket that doesnt mean 
that local government is against the automobile industry 
owensboro with a population of 55000 is a major tobacco sales 
center for western kentucky burley the daviess county farm bureau 
estimates that area tobacco sales topped 25 million last year 
pinkerton manufactures loose leaf and plug chewing tobaccos and 
also makes some smoking tobacco products 
luther pittman executive vice president for operations at 
pinkerton said in a letter to adkisson that the company would 
rethink its plans for the future in daviess county but he said 
his letter does not mean the company is planning to pull out of the 
county 
one wholesaler said its not so much the policy that worries 
him but the trend 
its the kind of negative thinking that we shouldnt have in 
owensboro daviess county or the commonwealth of kentucky where so 
many dollars are derived from tobacco said truett cook 
president of lyons bro wholesalers a distributor of tobacco

lands friday and a 20yearold man shot in the chest became the 
200th palestinian killed since a rebellion against israeli rule 
began six months ago 
officials at alia hospital in hebron said relatives of mustafa 
ahmed halaika told them the man was shot by jewish settlers in the 
nearby west bank village of shuykh 
he died of a bullet wound in the chest and three other arabs 
were wounded by gunfire in the village the hospital officials 
said soldiers wounded two other palestinians during a protest in 
nablus 
the threeday strike that began friday was total stores were 
closed streets were deserted and there was no public 
transportation throughout the west bank and gaza strip 
halaikas relatives said five jewish settlers opened fire when 
palestinians protested their presence in shuykh the hospital 
officials said 
a palestinian driver who accompanied two journalists to the 
hospital quoted a 15yearold villager nael ayaide as saying the 
settlers beat him and another arab 
villagers began stoning the settlers who then opened fire the 
driver quoted ayaide as saying the driver said ayaide had a broken 
arm 
the driver and hospital officials would not allow their names to 
be used a military spokesman said the army was investigating the 
reports 
the driver said the two arabs wounded in nablus were shot when 
soldiers opened fire on protesters who erected barricades and threw 
stones 
according to un figures 200 arabs have been killed since the 
uprising began dec 8 among the 15 million palestinians of the 
west bank and gaza which israel captured from jordan and egypt in 
the 1967 war an israeli soldier and a teenage jewish settler also 
have been slain 
the army prepared for more violence by restricting the movements 
of more than 200000 palestinians with curfews and closures at 12 
refugee camps towns and villages 
in the gaza strip israeli soldiers orders a metalworks closed 
for three years the army accused the owner nasser youssef of

minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing likud bloc opposes an exchange 
of occupied land for peace the basis of the us plan shultz is 
promoting 
in a leaflet calling for the strike underground leaders accused 
shultz of trying to abort the rebellion 
the masses and activists must make more demonstrations and 
the land must burn under the feet of the fascist occupier the 
leaflet said

word for uprising 
shamir defense minister yitzhak rabin and other israeli leaders 
have said recently the rebellion was abating and clinton bailey an

a judge today refused to grant a mistrial 
in former gov evan mechams criminal trial rejecting a defense 
argument that the prosecution introduced improper testimony during 
the trials first day 
the motion contended that testimony thursday by a prosecution 
witness suggests that the defendants had committed prior bad acts 
or criminal conduct involving altered campaign records 
it referred to testimony by william flynn a state handwriting 
expert that there had been whiteouts erasures and 
alterations in a campaign checkbook defense lawyer thomas crowe 
said 
crowe contended the changes were merely innocent corrections 
but that the prosecution implied there was something sinister 
about them 
mecham and his brother willard are charged with concealing a 
350000 campaign loan willard mecham was his brothers 1986 
campaign treasurer 
prosecutor barnett lotstein said today there was no negative 
implication in the testimony about the checkbook he said the 
prosecution was seeking to show that willard mecham was a 
meticulous bookkeeper who was not prone to mistakes 
maricopa county superior court judge michael ryan said in his 
ruling that he thought flynns testimony was quite innocuous 
in opening statements thursday defense lawyers said the failure 
to report the loan was an innocent mistake while lotstein alleged 
the mechams purposely broke the law when they failed to include the 
loan from tempe developer barry wolfson in a financial report 
it was no oversight no mistake said lotstein an assistant 
attorney general no person looking at this report would have any 
idea that barry wolfson had anything to do with the 350000 that 
came into the campaign 
about 90 minutes before the start of the trial thursday the 
arizona supreme court rejected a defense bid to dismiss the charges 
or return them to the state grand jury for a new determination of 
probable cause the defense has claimed the grand jury was misled 
by the state attorney generals office 
mecham faces up to 22 years in prison if convicted on all six 
counts of perjury willful concealment and filing false documents 
the republican governor was removed from office april 4 when the 
state senate convicted him of two unrelated impeachment counts 
mecham took office in january 1987 
willard mecham faces three similar counts and up to 9 years in 
prison if convicted 
mecham long has contended the 350000 loan was properly 
reported on his dec 5 1986 financial report he said it was 
included in a 465000 lump sum that was listed as a contribution 
from himself 
if you wanted to conceal a loan you could do it very easily 
scott said the prosecutions case is made out of smoke 
lotstein told the jury that mecham had a 1986 campaign theme 
of being beholden to no one and that the theme could have been 
harmed by public knowledge that a major part of his war chest came 
from a developer 
but scott noted that mecham was elected nov 4 1986 a month 
before the financial report was filed 
flynn testified that the evan mecham signed on one of the 
governors 1986 campaign financial reporting statements was not 
mechams handwriting but is rather an attempt to simulate or 
draw the signature of evan mecham 
the signatures on mechams other documents were genuine flynn 
testified scott objected saying no one had disputed the 
authenticity of the forms themselves 
scott also said a mecham administration official mac matheson 
was responsible for omitting the debt to wolfson from mechams 
personal disclosure form filed in early 1987 the defense lawyer 
added that other officials were allowed to amend their forms 
without being prosecuted 
willard mechams lawyer joe keilp said in his opening 
statement that his client did not intentionally violate the law as 
the 1986 campaigns bookkeeper

highenergy physics project 
the super collider which advocates say could lead to 
breakthroughs in understanding basic matter would be authorized 
147 million in fiscal 1989 and 675 million and 774 million the 
following two years 
there is no guarantee that the money would flow to the project 
which would eventually cost at least 54 billion actual spending 
is controlled by separate appropriations legislation 
the house recently approved an appropriations bill limiting 
super collider spending in fiscal 1989 which begins oct 1 to 
100 million none would be available to begin construction of the 
project

development by the department of energy including cleancoal 
technology and alternative motor fuels

human rights activist andrei d sakharov said 
friday that mikhail s gorbachev has not yet guaranteed human 
rights but that the soviet leader must be given time and trust to 
carry out his reforms 
sahharov the 1975 nobel peace prize winner and a former 
political exile told reporters at the foreign ministry press 
center that his unprecedented appearance at a government building 
reflects a change in the situation in this country and its not 
a matter of me changing my position 
he held his news conference in the same hall where soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev on wednesday held his first formal meeting 
with reporters in the soviet union 
sakharov 67 handed gorbachev a list of names of 200 political 
prisoners when they met for the first time in january on friday 
he called again for the release of those who remain incarcerated 
for their beliefs 
the physicist who helped develop the soviet hydrogen bomb and 
found the soviet human rights movement also criticized officials 
for withdrawing a job offer to a dissident who met with president 
reagan during the summit 
the move was a blatant example of a return to the practices of 
the past sakharov said 
sakharov sat at a desk in front of hundreds of foreign and 
soviet reporters rather than on the elevated dais and he drew a 
larger crowd than gorbachev 
until recently such a news conference would have been 
unthinkable for sakharov who was exiled to the closed city of 
gorky in january 1980 for criticizing soviet intervention in 
afghanistan 
gorbachev allowed sakharov to return to moscow in december 1986 
i believe sizeable changes have taken place of late of course 
they are not exhaustive and do not ensure the full implementation 
of human rights sakharov said on the whole i believe 
perestroika gorbachevs social and economic reforms is a serious 
undertaking and its international and domestic implications are 
very serious too 
an expression of trust in this country would only promote 
perestroika in this country in particular an expression of 
confidence in this country and this government will help promote 
human rights issues too 
he said he is worried about the future of gorbachevs reforms 
but believes they will succeed because there is no alternative 
sakharov called gorbachev an outstanding statesman and 
added from the bottom of my heart i wish him luck mainly for 
the cause with which his name is now associated 
sakharov has been reluctant to talk to reporters since returning 
from gorky instead concentrating on scientific work and expressing 
his views in occasional letters to the official press 
he said he still is not free to travel abroad ostensibly 
because of his access to secret material until 1968 but feels he 
is free to do and and say what he wants in the soviet union 
sakharovs wife yelena bonner said her husband held the news 
conference at the government press center because reporters 
covering the summit meeting had called from morning to night 
asking for interviews 
on other issues in a wideranging discussion sakharov 
welcomed the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan which started 
may 15 he said it should go on regardless of the conduct of 
antimarxist afghan rebels any afghan who wants it should be given 
political asylum in the soviet union or another country he said 
urged the soviet union to cut its military personnel by 50 
percent and criticized what he said is abuse of inductees in the 
soviet military 
said he believes the soviet union eventually will have more 
than one political party 
supported the demands of two ethnic groups crimean tatars who 
want to return to their home area from which they were exiled by 
dictator josef stalin and armenians who want to annex the 
nagornokarabakh region of azerbaijan 
called for greater religious freedom and official recognition 
of the underground ukrainian catholic church 
sakharov who has spoken out on nuclear arms reduction said the 
summit between reagan and gorbachev was important but did not 
achieve much 
he urged the two sides to work for more progress on a treaty to 
halve their longrange nuclear missiles saying they can work 
around their disputes over verification problems and reagans 
strategic defense initiative 
sakharov praised reagans meeting on monday with soviet 
dissidents and refuseniks but criticized the soviet reaction a 
longtime dissident lost a job opportunity because of his 
attendance sakharov said 
he said sergei kovalov a biologist had reached an agreement to 
receive a job in a moscow institute but was told the day after his 
meeting with reagan that the institute had changed its mind 
kovalov was exiled in the 1970s for his work publishing underground 
political material

a bomb hidden in a trash bin 
exploded on a busy street corner friday killing four people and 
injuring 19 in south africas deadliest bombing in more than a year 
law and order minister adriaan vlok blamed the african national 
congress guerrilla movement which has been accused of four other 
bombings in the past nine days 
the anc has not commented on the recent bombings but it issued 
a statement friday from its headquarters in lusaka zambia saying 
the month of june must be a period of united and decisive popular 
offensive against the government 
the statement endorsed a threeday antiapartheid protest 
scheduled to start monday saying south africas economy must 
grind to a halt on those days 
the anc is the main guerrilla group fighting the south african 
government 
several corporations sought court orders friday barring black 
unions from organizing work stoppages next week the employers 
alleged that the protest could lead to violence 
the bomb exploded at 130 pm outside a branch of the standard 
bank in roodepoort a city that borders the west side of 
johannesburg three black men and a white woman were killed 
a roodepoort police spokesman maj tiene halgryn said eight 
people were seriously injured including two whites and six blacks 
he said 11 people suffered less severe injuries 
police said most of the victims were waiting at the street 
corner for a traffic light to change when the explosion ripped 
through a metal trash bin 
the blast shattered windows in the bank and nearby stores in 
roodepoorts central business district 
police said the explosive device was a sovietmade limpet mine 
and they searched for other bombs in the area 
most of the bombings blamed on the anc in recent months have 
involved limpet mines government posters encourage the public to 
watch out for the mines which can be attached to other objects 
if everyone is on guard the ancs diabolical plans cannot 
succeed said vlok the law and order minister 
the anc has waged a bombing and sabotage campaign since 1961 as 
part of its efforts to topple the government and end apartheid the 
system of racial separation that denies south africas black 
majority a vote in national affairs 
in the past the ancs official policy has been to aim its 
attacks at targets linked to the government and security forces 
its leaders have warned that some civilian casualties were 
inevitable 
the death toll in roodepoort was the highest from a bombing in 
south africa since a car bomb killed four white policemen in 
johannesburg in may 1987 
it was the fifth bombing reported in the area in a nineday 
span the only other injuries came from a may 26 bombing in 
pretoria that hurt four white women 
the statement from anc headquarters issued shortly after 
fridays explosion said the anc had distributed leaflets in south 
africa endorsing the planned protests by antiapartheid labor 
unions and church groups 
government officials and employers have warned that workers who 
participate face dismissal or legal action 
the protest is intended to express opposition to the bannings of 
major antiapartheid organizations and other government moves 
against opposing trade unions newspapers and individual activists 
the two largest black federations say their main grievance is 
proposed labor legislation that would curtail unions ability to 
strike 
the chamber of mines which represents south africas six major 
mining companies said the unions were using the proposed bill as 
a rallying point to polarize the work force 
one gold mining company free state consolidated said it 
obtained a court injunction friday barring the black miners union 
from organizing a protest strike 
the company said the protest call has been backed by threats 
of violence and coercion

authorities seeking to ease tension after a gang 
killed a university student arrested six suspects friday and agreed 
to most demands of fellow students who marched in protest 
hundreds of students at beijing university gathered at the 
center of campus into early saturday to discuss the slaying and 
their demands for retribution 
chai qingfeng 22 a geophysics graduate student died thursday 
of injuries suffered the day before when he and several classmates 
were beaten by a gang of youths off campus 
the official xinhua news agency said friday that police had 
arrested six suspects it did not identify them one of many 
student posters on campus demanded that authorities make the 
killers pay their blood debt 
students at chinas leading university said police should have 
stopped the killing and 2000 marched in protest thursday night 
about 700 of them walked the 10 miles to tiananmen square in 
central beijing where they met before dawn friday with officials 
of the public security ministry 
they demanded swift arrests a public trial on campus full 
media coverage of their protest better campus security a 
university memorial service for chai and compensation for his 
family 
beijing universitys general affairs advisory office put a 
notice on the campus bulletin board late friday indicating 
officials agreed to all demands except trial on campus it said 
media coverage could not be ordered but the students scoffed at 
that 
the beijing daily newspaper carried a brief report friday on 
chais death but the official media did not mention the student 
march until a short xinhua report early saturday 
according to the advisory office notice vice minister of public 
security yu lei acknowledged we didnt do our job well and we 
will definitely learn a lesson from this case 
his ministry also declared the student demands just and 
reasonable which implied no action would be taken even though the 
march was illegal 
it was the largest demonstration since student prodemocracy 
protests in the winter of 198687 that led to the ouster of 
communist party chief hu yaobang and a nationwide campaign against 
westernstyle liberalism 
since then permission has been required for street marches 
the advisory office notice said public security officials would 
visit the campus saturday to study ways of tightening security 
theft is common at chinese universities but violent attacks on 
students are unusual posters protesting lawlessness and poor 
security appeared on the beijing university bulletin board and 
several noted it was the second killing of a student in the past 
year 
a student at the university of foreign economic relations was 
slain in december in a fight with two local youths one of whom was 
executed about 1000 students marched to government offices in 
central beijing to protest that killing 
an 18yearold woman who took part in thursdays march said 
several police vehicles followed but did not try to stop the 
protest 
she said public security officials told the marchers they 
understood us but that it is not a good idea to take to the 
streets 
school spokesman li yansong said the university is of course 
on the side of the students we can say the students demands are 
just but the university first must investigate the matter 
he said a memorial service would be held for chai but no date 
had been set

iraqi forces on friday drove off an 
iranian warplane that flew 110 miles into iraq and tried to bomb 
president saddam husseins family home north of baghdad a military 
command announced 
while maneuvering to evade iraqi ground fire the iranian jet 
dropped all its load of explosives indiscriminately in the 
village of ouja just south of tikrit saddams hometown the 
official iraqi news agency said 
no injuries were reported in the attack at 555 am according 
to the news agency the report monitored in nicosia did not say 
whether saddam was home at the time it was the first time the 
iraqis have reported an attack on saddams hometown during the 
nearly 8yearold iraniraq war 
the report did not say whether the usbuilt iranian f4 
phantom jet was hit 
irans official islamic republic news agency said its warplanes 
on friday attacked military targets in three raids on iraq 
including one near tikrit at 525 am but it gave no other 
details 
irans new acting commanderinchief hashemi rafsanjani urged 
his countrymen to take the war with iraq more seriously 
the iraqi news agency did not explain how the iranian plane flew 
undetected all the way from the border 110 miles to the east to 
attack saddams home which is 100 miles northwest of baghdad 
military analysts said an f4 flying at low altitudes is capable of 
evading detection by radar 
after the attack saddam led a meeting of the governing 
revolutionary command council 
an official spokesman who was not identified by name said the 
leadership decided not to carry out a direct retaliation today 
to help the iranian people liberate themselves from the 
nightmare of these evil charlatan rulers 
but he added iraq will reserve its right to carry out a 
crushing and comprehensive retaliation at the appropriate time 
he called the iranian attack a flagrant violation of a truce in 
the war of the cities 
thousands of civilians in both countries were killed in 
longrange missile duels and air raids that raged for two months 
before the april 21 ceasefire in the war of the cities many of 
the missiles hit tehran and baghdad 
rafsanjani the speaker of irans parliament was appointed by 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini on thursday as acting 
commanderinchief a post khomeini had held since the islamic 
revolution in 1979 
rafsanjani told a prayer meeting in tehran on friday there 
should be no compromise no submission and no backing down from 
our rights in the war his speech was carried by irna which also 
was monitored in nicosia we should take the situation more 
seriously he told the worshipers 
the iranian agency also reported that rafsanjani sent a cable to 
the 87yearold khomeini thanking him for the new appointment 
iran suffered two recent major defeats on the battlefield in 
april iraqi forces retook the southern faw peninsula two years 
after it was captured by the iranians last month the iraqis 
recaptured salamchah east of the city of basra the latter region 
had been overrun in an iranian thrust last year 
earlier friday rafsanjani told a congress commemorating a 1963 
attempted uprising against shah mohammad reza pahlavi that the war 
with iraq should continue until all the objectives set by khomeini 
are reached 
rafsanjani said if we back down even a bit in the war we 
will sustain major losses he called on armed forces to recruit 
more people into warrelated affairs so that arrogance will 
be deprived of its last weapon and we can prepare to face the next 
schemes of the worlddevourers

the government and the aircraft industry need 
to avoid any knee jerk reactions to the recent inflight 
breakup of a 19yearold aloha airlines 737 a federal aviation 
official said friday 
but robert goodrich director of the federal aviation 
administrations office of flight standards said the horrible 
unzipping of the aloha plane prompted the faa to make a thorough 
review of inspection and maintenance programs for aging jetliners 
if we have a good program we need to validate it and if we 
have a problem we need to find it goodrich told reporters at the 
conclusion of a threeday faasponsored conference on aging 
airplanes 
goodrich said that while nothing particularly new surfaced 
during the conference he thought it would help restore public 
confidence in the airline industry and represented a new 
commitment to safety 
the conference which involved about 350 aircraft design and 
maintenance experts issued a series of recommendations including 
additional research and testing of older planes by either the 
faa or the national aeronautics and space administration that may 
involve the federal government actually buying several aging 
jetliners 
increased communication between the airlines manufacturers and 
the faa 
a review of all aspect of human factors involved in 
inspection and maintenance 
goodrich said such things as boredom and fatigue by inpsectors 
and maintenance personnel could be a problem 
it could be a weak link he said the human element must 
keep up with the technology growth we need to make sure inspection 
and maintenance is adequate we think it is 
the faa hopes to hire an additional 1000 inspectors in the next 
fiscal year he said 
among other suggestions that surfaced at the conference was 
imposing a mandatory retirement age for airplanes but goodrich 
said the faa believed that would be arbitrary and that the 
increasing costs of maintaining an older plane usually dictate when 
it is retired 
that would be a kneejerk reaction goodrich said of 
mandatory retirement 
boeing officials also have said they are against mandatory 
retirement for commercial jets 
goodrich said the aloha accident has helped focus the attention 
of manufacturers airlines and the faa on possible problems with 
older airplanes 
the history of the fleet says we are doing well he said 
i dont think it is a serious snowplowing problem that is getting 
ahead of the industry but one event is too many 
in the aloha accident in april a 20foot section of the 
boeingbuilt plane tore away at 24000 feet over hawaii and a 
flight attendant was swept to her death although the pilots were 
able to land the plane safely 
aloha officials have said repeatedly that they followed all 
required inspections on the jetliner

the case of the confiscated cookies has 
ended with their maker giving up a little dough and county offices 
no longer smelling like a cookie jar 
the evidence became garbage wednesday when 979 tubs of chocolate 
chip cookies weighing 2448 pounds were deposited at the brea 
dump 
the cookies made by hobbitt cookies of santa ana were 
confiscated from two stores in november as alleged evidence that 
the bakery was operating without a health permit 
for eight months the cookies were stacked 10 feet high in a 
meeting room at the orange county environmental health office 
covering two walls 
no one was happier to get rid of the cookies than bob merryman 
the countys environmental health director the room really is 
kind of sickening one smell of cookies is ok but you get this big 
whiff when you open the door he said i had to leave meetings 
after half an hour 
this was not your normal runofthemill criminal case said 
randall hite the attorney for hobbitt when people around the 
courthouse realized what it was about it became known as the 
cookie caper 
the caper concluded after hobbitt charged with nine counts of 
violating the california uniform retail food facilities law agreed 
to a settlement last month under which all charges were dropped 
the settlement called for hobbitt to pay 750 drop a claim it 
had filed against the city and relinquish ownership of the 
confiscated cookies 
this is the most unusual condemnation im aware of in 17 years 
here said jim huston assistant director of county environmental 
health 
a county health inspector discovered alleged violations at 
hobbitts santa ana plant a year ago and the company was ordered to 
shut down but in october inspectors found evidence of clandestine 
cookie baking including raw ingredients and utensils huston said 
the cookies were seized as evidence 
hobbitt filed a claim against the city contending the 
confiscated cookies were baked legally at a licensed plant in 
adjoining los angeles county 
the santa ana plant was used only for testing recipes and as a 
training area for people learning to make the cookies by hand 
hite said 
there were never any allegations that the cookies were in any 
way contaminated or unsafe it was all building code and permitting 
violations hite said 
the cookies are probably the finest ones made anywhere take 
my word for it ive sat in front of my television set and eaten 
half a tubful he added

the leader of irans only legal opposition movement 
has protested to ayatollah ruhollah khomeini about a series of 
arrests that followed criticism of the ayatollahs policies 
according to reports reaching paris on friday 
in a telegram to irans spiritual leader mehdi bazargan took 
responsiblity for letters written by himself and his supporters 
calling for an end to the war with iraq the french newspaper le 
monde reported 
our only crime is to be concerned about the dangers which 
threaten the existence of our country and its survival le monde 
quoted the telegram as saying 
there had been concern that bazargan also had been arrested but 
he was at his tehran home on thursday le monde reported 
in late may bazargan circulated an open letter to khomeini 
accusing him of practicing despotism worthy of the pharaohs and 
making iran a symbol of hate around the world 
security forces subsequently rounded up numerous sympathizers of 
bazargan who had circulated their own letter according to le monde 
and parisbased opposition figures with sources in iran 
bazargan a former iranian prime minister and parliamentary 
deputy heads the freedom movement the only opposition group 
tolerated by khomeinis regime 
it was not clear how many arrests were made le monde suggested 
that several dozen people many former government ministers could 
have been detained 
the letters from bazargan and his supporters said to have been 
distributed over the past two weeks called for negotiations to end 
the iraniraq war 
former iranian president abolhassan banisadr living in exile 
in paris said his contacts in iran were able to confirm that 
bazargan was not under arrest 
observers say bazargans open letter was his strongest protest 
to date and had special impact because of an increasingly tense 
climate in tehran after recent setbacks in the iraniraq war 
bazargan has protested in the past but not in these terms and 
in this situation banisadr said in a telephone interview with 
the associated press the arrests show that this letter is not 
like others it reveals the condition of public opinion in iran 
on thursday khomeini appointed parliament speaker hashemi 
rafsanjani as acting commanderinchief of irans armed forces on 
friday rafsanjani called on iranians to take the war more 
seriously 
banisadr first president of the islamic republic and former 
armed forces commanderinchief said he had ample information to 
show an intense dispute over the conduct of the war within the 
armed forces 
on thursday le monde printed excerpts from bazargans letter to 
khomeini 
in truth for seven years iran and islam have become 
synonymous in the world with hate and malice the excerpt read 
it is a shame and not an honor 
when are you going to stop making commerce with the blood of 
our martyrs 
banisadr said that among those arrested were ali ardalan a 
former finance minister husseini shah hussein president of the 
welcome committee when the exiled khomeini returned to iran in 
1980 former interior minister hachem sabbaghian and former 
justice and interior minister ahmed sadr djavadi

kitty dukakis wife of the democratic presidential 
frontrunner underwent five hours of delicate surgery friday to 
correct a spinal problem that doctors had feared could lead to 
paralysis husband michael dukakis canceled campaign plans to be 
with her 
i talked to kitty in the recovery room and she said she wanted 
an ice cream and a massage dukakis said following the surgery 
im prepared to provide both 
dr lawrence borges said the operation went very well there 
were no problems at all 
borges said mrs dukakis would be in the intensive care unit 
overnight and would remain in massachusetts general hospital for 
about a week doctors said she woke up immediately after the 
operation 
surgeons removed two herniated discs from mrs dukakis neck and 
replaced them with bone taken from her hip she had been 
experiencing pain and numbness fr several weeks and doctors 
determined both problems were caused by dangerous pressure on her 
spine because of the discs 
her husband the massachusetts governor returned from 
california thursday night and spent the night in his wifes room at 
the hospital 
dukakis said that if no complications developed from the 
operation he would resume campaigning saturday afternoon in new 
jersey he said he planned to return to boston saturday night to 
visit his wife again then go back to new jersey sunday morning and 
then head to california for campaigning through tuesday the last 
day of the 1988 primary season 
the governor canceled a debate thursday with democratic rival 
jesse jackson to return to boston and he said he thought it 
unlikely the debate would be rescheduled 
new jersey california new mexico and montana hold the final 
democratic presidential primaries tuesday dukakis is favored to 
win in all four states gaining enough delegates to assure him the 
democratic nomination to face likely republican nominee george bush 
in november 
mrs dukakis was campaigning in california on behalf of her 
husband when she was diagnosed as having herniated discs she 
returned home wednesday night for additional tests and doctors 
decided immediate surgery was the best course 
because she had more than one herniated disc and because the 
problem was in her neck doctors said waiting before correcting the 
problem could lead to permanent nerve damage and possibly 
paralysis the discs serve as soft cushions between the bony 
vertebrae that protect the spinal cord 
after the surgery her doctors said mrs duakakis should regain 
full mobility of her neck but would have to wear a cervical collar 
for several weeks she also likely will walk with a limp for 
several weeks because of the surgery to remove the bone from her 
hip 
mrs dukakis is considered to be in good overall health last 
year she said she had been addicted to amphetamines for 26 years 
before entering a drug clinic in 1982

a harris county democratic official says the 
local party is 120000 in debt partly because contributions 
dropped off after a follower of extremist lyndon larouche was 
elected chairman 
while donations have begun flowing in again a more extensive 
fundraising effort is planned said party executive director bill 
ramsey 
claude jones the larouche follower whose position as chairman 
has been stripped of most of its power is not being asked to 
participate ramsey said 
there was a fundraising setback when mr jones was elected 
chairman because our traditional contributors wanted to be 
reassured their contributions would not be going to him said 
ramsey i think his presence would be a detriment to 
fundraising 
jones who upset incumbent party chairman larry veselka in the 
march 8 election declined comment on the situation

transplant patients fare much better with poorly 
matched kidneys from living relatives than wellmatched organs from 
dead strangers a finding that could spark more donations by family 
members doctors said friday 
the option is especially appealing they said because demand is 
up but organ donation is down 
there are a lot of people that can be helped that you would 
otherwise have waiting in line said dr dixon kaufman a 
transplant fellow at the university of minneosta 
the point is dont just discount kidneys from family 
members whose tissue does not properly match the recipient he said 
at the annual meeting of the american society of transplant 
surgeons 
to do so is absolutely criminal said john najarian a 
transplant surgeon at the university of minnesota 
the very best cadaver kidney wont touch the worst 
livingrelated donor never has never will najarian said 
the practice of removing one of two kidneys from a healthy 
person for transplantation was common in the 1960s and 1970s 
because of ineffective antirejection medication but now that 
therapy is improved and overall success rates are up some doctors 
contend its not worth putting two people the donor and recipient 
at risk 
although none of the living donors in minnesota has suffered 
major complications there are reports of 20 fatalities worldwide 
as a result of kidney donation 
it would be nice if we had enough cadaver donors so we 
wouldnt have to do livingrelated donors at all but we dont 
said dr robert j corry of the university of iowa 
of the 8972 kidney transplants performed in 1987 down slightly 
from the previous year about a quarter of the organs were provided 
by healthy family members according to dr barry kahan director 
of organ transplantation at the university of texas medical school 
at houston 
although thats down considerably from years past the numbers 
could be headed back up as a result of the recent slide in organ 
donation kahan said at the same time the number of those 
awaiting a kidney transplant has continued to mount 
for insular dependent diabetics time is of particular 
importance since they do not tolerate dialysis as well as others 
with kidney failure 
what the university of minnesota has found is a logical 
extension of how to deal with the shortage of organs from 
braindead donors kahan said we need to make family members 
aware of the fact that donations from the living may be the most 
efficient way to get transplanted 
kaufman and his associates at minnesota looked at the success 
rates of 657 transplants performed from 1980 to 1987 315 of them 
involving organs from healthy brothers or sisters 
of the 149 instances in which the recipient got a perfectly 
matched kidney from a sibling the organs were functioning in 94 
percent of the cases two years after surgery kaufman said all six 
antigens or genetic markers were shared by the donor and 
recipient 
the success rate was 91 percent for the 131 who received a 
partially matched kidney in which three to five antigens were 
shared by the siblings and it was 93 percent for the 35 who got an 
organ from a sibling with only one or two antigens in common 
that compared to an overall success rate of 74 percent for the 
patients who received kidneys from braindead victims after waiting 
up to several years kaufman said the success rate climbed to 78 
percent when four to six antigens were matched between donor and 
recipient 
kaufman said researchers did not know why the lesser matched 
kidneys from relatives did better than the ones with three to five 
antigens in common 
despite the anomaly kaufman said the bestmatched kidney should 
be used whether the selection is being made among a group of 
relatives or the choice is among donor organs from dead strangers 
its prudent to use the best match in terms of livingrelated 
donors everyone being willing he said 
the findings are not meant to suggest in any way shape or 
form that it doesnt matter who the donor is as long as theyre 
alive and well according to kaufman 
when you are related you are inheriting other chromosomes 
that may have a beneficial effect on your kidney he said 
whereas somebody who is totally unrelated just because theyre 
alive may not pass along that added benefit and in that case it 
truly may not be any better than having a cadaver kidney

a site selection committee recommended friday 
that the headquarters of the 17 millionmember united church of 
christ be moved from new york city to cleveland 
the united church of christ has a rich presence in cleveland 
which is representative of different ethnic strains and racial 
composition said the committee chairman the rev john h 
krueger of fort wayne ind we were impressed with the way in 
which the churches and the civic entities private and public all 
seem to be cooperative and provide the environment in which people 
live and work 
delegates to the uccs 16th general synod a year ago asked the 
panel to consider staying in new york or move to either cleveland 
or st louis mo 
the decision wont become final until the churchs next synod in 
fort worth texas in 1989 said spokeswoman martha gotwals 
the move could mean as many as 310 new jobs for cleveland and 
some members of the new york staff are expected to transfer ms 
gotwals said some of uccs leases in new york expire in 1989 she 
said 
krueger said the next step for the committee will be to pick a 
site in cleveland he said the group saw some properties when it 
visited in march and the united church may buy or lease a building 
or construct a new building the committee hopes to select a site 
by next spring he said 
ucc has 167914 members in ohio ms gotwals said 
more than a year ago a previous headquarters location committee 
suggested that the national headquarters be moved to st louis it 
then changed its recommendation to suggest only that the 
headquarters be moved from new york by 1991 
the decision was made more complicated at last summers synod in 
cleveland when david a jones president of humana inc offered 
to lease office space in a louisville ky building he owns for 1 
a year for 10 years after 10 years the space would have been 
given to ucc 
before louisville made its bid the uccs executive council had 
considered cleveland chicago indianapolis new york and st 
louis but at last years synod the 700 delegates voted to limit 
the cities being considered to cleveland new york and st louis

wayne williams convicted of two murders and 
suspected of many more in the series of killings of young blacks 
that rocked the city in 197981 lost his first chance at parole 
state officials announced friday 
the georgia board of pardons and paroles announced that it had 
denied parole for williams 29 who is serving two life sentences 
at the georgia diagnostic and classification center in jackson 
spokesman silas moore said the board informed williams of its 
decision in a letter mailed wednesday 
williams attorney lynn whatley said the boards decision was 
not disappointing because the board routinely denies parole on an 
inmates first review 
i think it was done in a manner of course what they do for 
all inmates whatley said it doesnt disappoint us doesnt 
take away our momentum 
whatley said he and williams are more concerned with appealing 
his convictions for the murders of nathaniel cater and jimmy ray 
payne there may be some action on williams appeal in butts county 
superior court during the summer he said 
we expect to be successful in the appellate court before the 
end of the year whatley said we have a tremendous amount of 
suppressed evidence and we intend to use it in court 
williams a freelance photographer was convicted feb 27 
1982 of two counts of murder in what had become known as the 
atlanta child slayings he was not charged in the 27 other deaths 
of young blacks that took place between 1979 and 1981 although 22 
of the cases were closed and attributed to williams after his 
conviction 
georgia law requires that inmates serving life sentences 
automatically be considered for parole after seven years williams 
who was arrested in june 1981 will be eligible for parole 
consideration again in 1996 moore said 
you can be assured that it was the majority decision of the 
board moore said adding that the fivemember board cited the 
circumstances and nature of the offenses as reasons for denying 
parole

police chief robert omalley will never 
forget the great phone outage like the morning he spent on a 
cellular car phone trying to reach fire chief stan bulat who was 
parked just a few feet away 
i guess everybody will have something to remember that outage 
by and that phone call to stan will be mine omalley said 
both were dependent on their cellular car telephones and kept 
missing each other when they finally hooked up i said we need 
to meet where are you he said behind the fire station i said 
me too omalley recalled 
thats when we realized we were parked just feet from each 
other on either side of a van he said 
quite frankly im glad it wasnt a crime wave or something 
more serious like that 
at 1201 am cdt sunday about 35000 customers in hinsdale and 
five other west chicago suburbs are to be returned to full phone 
service for the first time since a mothers day fire at a illinois 
bell switching station 
there hasnt been a lot to laugh about on this one but 
the people who worked there can deservedly feel some pride said 
bell spokesman tim bannon 
some residential and business service as well as 
passthrough telephone traffic from chicago joliet and 
elsewhere has returned in stages all that remains to be done 
sunday is to transfer customers still dependent on damaged 
equipment to new gear 
it will mean no more static clicking or buzzing no more 
broken connections or any of the other meddlesome things that were 
upsetting customers bannon said 
as many as 250 workers worked 12hour shifts at the site since 
the may 8 fire but weve cut back on that number and weve even 
given most of these people some days off he said 
hannah beube already misses those bell workers 
many of them patronized her business the monogram shop one 
of the few that actually prospered during the outage 
they had us make up tshirts with their names and titles on 
them on the front and hinsdale 88 on the back said ms beube 
few other shopkeepers in this quiet community of 16700 will 
share her fond memories 
business was off by 60 percent or 70 percent for about two 
weeks said maria rendon coowner of jane and marias flower 
shop the first few days we filled existing orders and we 
thought maybe this wont be so bad 
then we ran out of work to do and we started reorganizing 
things then we started getting upset 
although illinois bell has promised rebates several businesses 
were angry enough to file lawsuits charging the utility was 
negligent in failing to staff the switching station which houses 
computerized equipment to connect local and longdistance calls 
firefighters reached the scene 82 minutes after an alarm registered 
at bells springfield monitoring station 
and illinois attorney general neil hartigan has filed a 
complaint with the illinois commerce commission seeking to have 
bell pick up the tab for financial losses 
some local governments face bills as high as 65000 for police 
overtime pay and emergency equipment but weve had to show a 
police presence and i think everybody understands that omalley 
said 
hinsdale officials and some downtown merchants plan a promotion 
and party june 18 to celebrate 
were doing the tshirts said ms beube theyll be 
illinois bells colors blue white and a little gold and across 
the front theyll say the bells are ringing in hinsdale

secretary of education william j bennett 
asked congress on friday to move quickly to keep alive a program 
that allows the internal revenue service to withhold tax refunds 
from student loan defaulters

the house and senate tax committees

midjune if the authority will be extended in order to continue 
carrying out offsets on 1987 tax returns and to gear up for the 
next tax year 
bennett said that 213 million has been recovered so far this 
fiscal year 50 million more than it had anticipated collections 
averaged 10 million a week during march april and may during the 
second week of may 16 million in refunds was withheld from 32000 
defaulters 
the 532 million figure includes some money that defaulters paid

vietnam is investigating more than 30 
cases that may involve americans missing in action from the vietnam 
war a us military team that visited hanoi said friday 
the team made the announcement after three days of talks with 
vietnamese government officials on accounting for a total of nearly 
1800 americans missing from the war 
the vietnamese reported to us that they are now investigating 
32 instances in which they have received information or remains 
which could be associated with missing americans the team said 
in a statement 
some of this investigative work is still in the preliminary 
stages it said consequently no conclusions can be drawn at 
this time from these investigations 
in the past the vietnamese often have followed up on such 
announcements with returns of remains the last return was on april 
6 when hanoi handed over 27 sets the largest such transfer since 
us forces withdrew from vietnam in 1973 
the american team said it provided specific information to the 
vietnamese and reviewed progress since technical specialists of the 
two sides last met in march the statement described this weeks 
meeting as positive and productive 
the fiveman team was from the us joint casualty resolution 
center and the army central identification laboratory in honolulu 
which are entrusted with resolving the fates of americans missing 
in foreign wars it was led by lt col paul mather head of the 
resolution centers office in bangkok 
this weeks meeting was the fifth since the two countries 
reached an agreement in august under which vietnam would accelerate 
the mia search and the united states would consider its requests 
for humanitarian aid 
since then vietnam has complained that the americans 
misinterpreted the agreement and that it still wanted aid from the 
us government not just from private agencies the united states 
has replied that it will not consider lifting an embargo on 
official aid until vietnamese troops leave cambodia

president najib left friday night for 
moscow with the selection of a new afghan government still 
undisclosed 
najib eight days ago announced his choice for a new prime 
minister and instructed him to form a new cabinet 
the composition of a new government rests with the ruling 
peoples democratic party of afghanistan its lack of haste in 
announcing the ministers has prompted speculation in diplomatic 
circles here that there are either divisions within the party or 
efforts were being made to bring in outsiders who could at least 
nominally be considered opposition members 
najib shook hands with members of his government and diplomats 
during a red carpet sendoff at kabul airport complete with 
military band and honor guard with fixed bayonets 
when asked by a reporter why the announcement of a cabinet was 
taking so long the 41yearold former secret police commander 
said it is not too late after two days everything will be 
solved 
the presidents departure was marked by the secrecy that 
surrounds official government ceremonies in a country wracked by 
war for the past decade although government officials had said 
they expected najib to fly to moscow on saturday morning late 
friday afternoon they suddenly put out the word that the president 
would leave within a few hours 
the airport was guarded by soviet troops as well as afghan 
security forces the soviets started withdrawing troops from 
afghanistan nearly three weeks ago heralding the end of their 
military intervention that began in 1979 to prop up a promoscow 
regime 
najibs choice for prime minister is mohammad hasan sharq who 
is regarded as an amiable technocrat and a political survivor he 
has served as deputy prime minister and as minister for refugee 
affairs to oversee the return of the more than 5 million afghans 
who fled the country during the war between moslem guerrillas and 
the afghan army and its soviet allies 
following his visit to moscow najib was scheduled to travel to 
new york to address the united nations followed by a visit to cuba

hearts and livers available for transplants are 
going to waste resulting in an untold loss of life according to a 
study 
doctors who tracked organs donated to a new york procurement 
agency put the blame friday on inefficiency and inadequate 
resources 
everybody does their best but the transplant system needs 
to flow more smoothly said dr john ricotta a kidney transplant 
surgeon at the university of rochester medical center 
in a report to the american society of transplant surgeons 
ricotta said up to half of all suitable livers and hearts donated 
to the university of rochester organ procurement program are being 
wasted 
he cited outdated national computer listings and the inability 
to quickly find candidates of similar blood type and size as the 
biggest obstacles to identifying recipients 
if theres no suitable recipient theres not much you can 
do about that ricotta said the bigger concern is that 50 
percent of our calls could have been avoided with a better 
placement system 
about 475 people are awaiting liver transplants in the united 
states and nearly 900 others are awaiting new hearts according to 
the united network for organ sharing the virginiabased 
organization has a federal contract to run the national organ 
procurement and transplantation network which links by computer 
all transplant centers and organ procurement agencies 
no statistics are available regarding the number of organs that 
are donated but go unused in the united states each year 
but some doctors question whether as many as half of all donated 
hearts and livers that could be transplanted are being buried 
instead 
one of the things theyre calling wastage is simply the 
absence of an appropriate recipient thats not a wasted organ 
its one thats just not used said dr john mcdonald the 
transplant societys president 
the university of rochester organ procurement program began its 
study about a year ago after experiencing considerable difficulty 
in placing donated livers and hearts their donated kidneys were 
being used at the medical center which transplants only kidneys 
or within the region 
officials tracked all organs donated through the rochester 
program from january 1985 to october 1987 when a new scoring 
system for allocating transplant organs became mandatory for united 
network of organ sharing members 
during the period 203 braindead patients were referred of 
which 74 proved medically suitable ricotta said families of the 
74 patients were approached about the possibility of organ 
donation and consent was obtained for 68 kidney donations 55 
liver donations and 44 heart donations 
by the time the organplacement process was completed 64 donors 
were found to be ultimately suitable for kidney donation 40 for 
liver donation and 42 for heart donation ricotta said one of the 
kidney donors later proved to be medically unsuitable reducing 
that number to 63 
kidneys from all 63 donors were transplanted but just 20 livers 
and 23 hearts were used the study said 
organ procurement coordinator richard kruk said he and others at 
the university of rochester organ procurement program made 411 
telephone calls in an attempt to place the 39 unused hearts and 
livers which were never removed from the donors bodies 
some transplant centers said they preferred waiting for a 
locally procured donor while others said they didnt think the 
organs suited their needs still others said that they didnt have 
a team available to retrieve the organs or that there wasnt any 
room in the intensivecare unit 
in some cases more than 22 hours were spent trying to place a 
donors kidney liver and heart but the toughest job by far was 
telling families their loved ones organs couldnt be used kruk 
said 
because the spirit of organ donation is altruistic because 
the next of kin are making a decision for the common good you 
dont want to lead them to believe the common good isnt being 
served he said it is being served its only that it could be 
better served

there is not enough evidence to determine 
whether the latest generation of birth control pills contributes to 
noncancerous ovarian cysts as some doctors suspect a food and 
drug administration panel concluded friday 
but the agencys outside advisory committee on fertility and 
maternal health drugs said it backs further studies already ordered 
by the fda to gather more data on the question 
a los angeles physician who was instrumental in first raising 
the issue said following fridays hearing that he never has claimed 
to have more than anecdotal evidence from his own practice and 
other doctors who contacted him 
obviously we dont have the answers yet dr james c 
caillouette said in an interview the data has not been developed 
yet i am pleased they the committee recognized there is a 
potential problem 
the fda already has instructed the three companies that sell the 
multipledosage or triphasic birth control pills to undertake 
studies to determine whether there is a higher incidence of 
functional ovarian cysts among women taking the new type pills 
none of the three has filed its study plans with the fda but 
such phase iv studies typically involve postmarket monitoring of 
the medical records of large numbers of patients perhaps 
thousands using a particular drug 
dr ridgely c bennett of the fda told the advisory panel the 
agency also was in the first stages of a larger study looking at 
california medicaid recipients taking different types of birth 
control pills 
there is no indication when any of those studies will be 
completed 
meanwhile there is no change in the status of the four 
triphasic pills which have carved out about a third of the total 
birth control pill market since their introduction in 1984 
fda figures presented at the hearing showed that one triphasic 
alone orthonovum 777 is the no 1 seller with 176 percent 
of the market as of last march the other triphasics are triphasil 
with 95 percent market share trinorinyl with 36 percent and 
trilevlen with 26 percent 
in all it is estimated that more than 50 million american women 
take some type of oral contraceptive 
caillouette a professor of gynecology at the university of 
southern california school of medicine said he remains convinced 
that the singledose pills are safer than the multiphasic versions 
i still have strong feelings that we have pills that in my 
experience are safer than the multiphasics he said 
a triphasic comes in three different colors denoting their 
different dose levels a woman taking such a prescription would 
take one color pill on certain days of the month and the other 
colors on other days 
representatives for the three us companies that market 
triphasics ortho pharmaceutical corp wyeth laboratories inc 
and syntex corp all say they are convinced of the pills safety 
but are cooperating with the fdaordered studies 
the other three major us distributors of birth control pills 
sell only singledose versions 
caillouette became concerned about two years ago when he had 
seven patients develop ovarian cysts within four months and 
realized he had prescriped the new multiphasic for each of them 
when he returned them to higherdose monophasic prescriptions 
the cysts went away he said 
since publishing a paper on his own experience in a medical 
journal last summer caillouette said he has received similar 
accounts from other doctors and now knows of 74 cases of ovarian 
cysts that may be linked to multiphasic birth control pills 
although not lifethreatening ovarian cysts sometimes have to 
be removed surgically and some women lose an ovary in the process

a young man who was wounded by a 
guntoting baby sitter on a shooting spree after he tried to calm 
and disarm her said friday he was neither angry nor fearful because 
his assailant was a sick individual 
it was a freak incident said philip andrew 20 at a 
highland park hospital news conference it was his first public 
comment on the shooting two weeks ago when 30yearold laurie dann 
went on a rampage in his hometown of winnetka a suburb north of 
chicago 
ms dann burst into the home of the andrew family whom she did 
not know on may 20 after shooting six children one fatally at 
the nearby hubbard woods elementary school after shooting andrew 
ms dann fatally shot herself while police surrounded the home 
the only way to really explain it is that this was a sick 
individual said andrew who was in fair condition recovering 
from a chest wound you cant make sense of it the rest of 
the people that come into my house arent going to be shooting at 
me 
rep john porter rill issued a statement friday calling 
andrew an authentic hero for trying to disarm ms dann andrew 
was to have started working this week as an intern in porters 
office in the suburb of deerfield 
the university of illinois senior a history major and swim team 
captain turned aside the accolade 
i wasnt forcing myself to do anything he said i think i 
acted just naturally in that situation i dont think i did 
anything really heroic 
in addition to andrew one of the five wounded children remains 
hospitalized 
andrew was in the kitchen with his mother when ms dann burst in 
the back door saying she had been sexually assaulted and had shot 
her assailant 
in the 40 to 50 minutes while she was in their house andrew 
said he and his parents tried to calm ms dann and persuade her to 
call police he said they also tried to persuade her to give up her 
guns 
we continued to talk to her i explained to her that i was 
familiar with the system and what was going to happen and i told 
her i was going to stay with her i was close enough to put my arms 
around her i was touching her andrew said 
it was going through my head that i could take the gun from 
her but i thought it was best at this point that she just give it 
up and i thought she would he said 
andrew finally decided to take one of the guns when ms dann set 
them both on a table but she became agitated and more possessive 
about the other weapon he said 
he said his mother left to warn his sisters not to enter the 
house and to call police 
then andrew and his father decided they would leave too but 
ms dann raised her remaining pistol and told him to stay he said 
then she may have seen a police officer andrew said because 
she suddenly turned around and shot him 
andrew said he didnt learn until after surgery that ms dann 
had fired shots in the nearby elementary school

president reagan reporting on summit talks in 
moscow said today that kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev is a 
serious man seeking serious reform but that the soviet union 
still should be viewed with caution 
let us embrace honest change when it occurs but let us also 
be wary let us stay strong reagan said in the address 
the president also said the west must continue to speak out 
about human rights conditions in the soviet union in matter of 
state unless the truth be spoken it ceases to exist he said 
winding up a 10day journey that included five days in the 
soviet capital reagan gave his summit assessment in a speech 
before the royal institute of international affairs at guildhall a 
center of civic government for more than 1000 years 
the speech was a rhetorical highlight of the trip offering 
encouragement for gorbachevs campaigns of perestroika and 
glasnost reforms while expressing cautious hope for a new 
era in history 
at the guildhall reagan passed along a corridor lined with the 
lord mayor sir greville spratts personal guard of pikemen and 
musketeers he was preceded by ceremonial sword and mace bearers 
into the woodpaneled great hall where he delivered the speech 
after a farewell to us embassy families here reagan and his 
wife nancy flew from london aboard air force one to washington and 
received a warm welcoming ceremony at andrews air force base md 
the white house distributed 4000 tickets for the ceremony to 
members of the republican national committee congressional 
families white house staff members and their families and 
political appointees 
the air force ceremonial band played martial music for an hour 
before the arrival and the spectators displayed signs reading 
another one for the gipper there you go again and 
welcome home 
reagans four days of talks with gorbachev did not produce any 
breakthrough on a strategic arms reduction treaty though both 
sides said some key differences had been narrowed nevertheless 
the two leaders displayed a warm personal relationship 
reagan said the soviet union is dominated now by talk of 
democratic reform in the economy in political institutions and 
in religious social and artistic life in short giving 
individuals more freedom to run their own affairs to control their 
own destinies 
to those of us familiar with the postwar era all of this is 
cause for shaking head in wonder reagan said expressing 
amazement about an american president and a soviet leader walking 
together in red square as he and gorbachev did talking about a 
growing personal friendship and meeting 
he said that episode was a special moment in a week of special 
moments 
my personal impression of mr gorbachev is that he is a 
serious man seeking serious reform reagan said i pray that 
the hand of the lord will be on the soviet people 
he said the strategy of the west for dealing with the soviets 
was bearing fruit 
quite possibly we are beginning to take down the barriers of 
the postwar era quite possibly we are entering a new era in 
history a time of lasting change in the soviet union he said 
we will have to see the president said but if so it is 
because of the steadfastness of the allies the democracies for 
more than 40 years and especially in this decade 
prime minister margaret thatcher speaking after reagan said 
we warmly congratulate you and general secretary gorbachev on a 
very successful summit one which will influence the course of 
history for years to come 
she also thanked reagan for pushing the human rights issue 
saying your words in moscow will have shone like a beacon of 
hope for all those wherever they are who are denied their basic 
freedoms 
reagan suggested he would continue to speak out against human 
rights abuses in the soviet union and elsewhere 
we have learned the first objective of the adversaries of 
freedom is to make free nations question their own faith in 
freedom to make us think that adhering to our principles and 
speaking out against human rights abuses or foreign aggression is 
somehow an act of belligerence 
in matters of state he said unless the truth be spoken 
it ceases to exist 
despite the impasse on a start treaty reagan spoke 
optimistically about chances for getting an agreement 
we made tangible progress toward the start treaty on strategic 
weapons the president said such a treaty with all its 
implications is i believe now within our grasp 
however he said there are other elements as important as arms 
negotations 
as i never tire of saying nations do not distrust each other 
because they are armed they are armed because they distrust each 
other reagan said so equally important items on the agenda 
in moscow dealt with critical issues like regional conflicts 
human rights and bilateral exchanges 
despite some progress american negotiators say the two sides 
made no progress on some of the thorniest areas of dispute 
sealaunched cruise missiles and the longstanding difference over 
reagans star wars missile defense system 
in his speech reagan paid a special mrs thatcher his close 
friend and ally noting that she had been among the first to 
suggest the west could do business with gorbachev 
at this hour in history prime minister the entire world 
salutes you and your gallant people and gallant nation 
underscoring the theme of human rights he trumpeted in the 
soviet union reagan said the best indicator of how much we care 
about freedom is what we say about freedom it is in this sense 
words truly are actions 
after the speech reagan retuned to the ambassadors residence 
for a meeting with japanese prime minister noboru takeshita 
as a halfdozen members of the japanese parliament looked on 
reporters questioned reagan during a picturetaking session on the 
back terrace of the winfield house 
asked if he were going to discuss trade with takeshita reagan 
said could be 
asked whether he and gorbachev had discussed the seoul olympics 
he said that did not come up 
after about three minutes reagan told reporters we have to 
go to work why dont you take the rest of the day off 
someone asked reagan to comment on whether gorbachev felt that 
he had abused soviet hospitality by speaking out on human rights in 
moscow 
he didnt give me any indication that he felt that way and we 
do think it is an important topic between us 
asked if gorbachev does not in fact set the tone for human 
rights in the soviet union reagan said its that entire system 
you cant put the blame on one individual 
asked if gorbachev intended to press forward with opening up the 
soviet union further he said he very definitely intends to go 
forward and its a definite improvement we parted in a very 
friendly manner 
on thursday queen elizabeth ii entertained him with tea at 
buckingham palace a band played tunes written by 100yearold 
american songmaster irving berlin and mrs thatcher saluted 
reagans tremendous success at his summit which she said 
heralds a new era in eastwest relations

a 16yearold boy was sentenced friday 
to 206 years in prison for killing a high school teacher and 
wounding three other people in a shooting he said stemmed from a 
failing grade in french 
district judge peter rapkoch imposed consecutive 100year terms 
on 16yearold kristofor hans for the murder of substitute teacher 
henrietta smith and the attempted murder of lewiston high school 
assistant principal john mofatt he then added three years to each 
for use of a weapon two students also were wounded in the december 
1986 shootings

the youth to concurrent 10year sentences for each of the assault 
charges involving the other students who were hit with bullet 
fragments rapkoch also added three years to each count for use of 
a weapon 
hans who pleaded guilty said he intended to kill his french 
teacher lavonne simonfy because she was giving him a failing 
grade that would have meant under terms of an agreement with his 
separated parents that he had to leave his mothers home in 
lewistown and go to live with his father in casper wyo 
smith was filling in that day for simonfy and was shot as she 
opened the door of simonfys classroom

surgery performed friday on kitty dukakis repaired 
spinal damage that probably resulted from a lifetime of modern 
dance her surgeon said 
in the fivehour operation doctors removed two discs in her 
neck and replaced them with bone taken from her left hip 
mrs dukakis wife of democratic presidential frontrunner 
michael dukakis began to suffer some numbness over the past three 
or four weeks diagnostic tests showed that two discs had ruptured 
and were pressing on her spinal column 
this is a dangerous condition that if uncorrected could have 
left her paralyzed from the shoulders down 
dr nicholas t zervas chief of neurosurgery at massachusetts 
general hospital in boston said the damage probably happened years 
ago but worsened over the past month 
mrs dukakis 51 studied and taught modern dance for three 
decades 
she was an athletic dancer when she was younger said 
zervas she described certain things she would do that caused 
extension of the neck that quite likely could cause some 
degeneration of the ligaments and bones and later on cause an 
actual hernia of the disc 
spinal discs act as cushions that separate the vertebrae that 
cover and protect the spinal cord problems occur when the discs 
squeeze out of place causing pain tingling and other symptoms 
such herniated discs also called slipped ruptured or 
prolapsed discs are relatively common usually however they 
occur in the lower back and dont endanger the spine 
mrs dukakiss case however was more serious she had suffered 
two ruptured discs in her neck and the broken discs were pressing 
on her spine 
given her problem with the discs pressing directly on the 
spinal cord we were concerned with her losing spinal cord 
function said dr lawrence borges the principal surgeon in 
its worse situation that could mean paralysis from the shoulders 
down 
the doctors began the surgery by making a cut in the left side 
of mrs dukakiss neck just above the collar bone then they went 
straight back toward the front of the spine 
there they found two discs broken into fragments and pushing 
into the spine just as magnetic and xray scans had shown 
the discs were removed from the front and cleaned out using 
the operating microscope all the way back to the front of the 
spinal cord said borges 
at that point dr frederick mansfield placed two pieces of 
bone one in each space taken from the left hip to take the place 
where the discs had been borges said these were fused 
together to make a nice stable construct along the neck 
by fusing the spine this way the doctors helped stabilize the 
spine protect the nerves and minimize the chance of pain 
borges said mrs dukakis should notice very little limitation in 
her ability to move her neck 
the doctors said she will have to wear a cervical collar for six 
to eight weeks until the bone grafts heal she will also limp for a 
few weeks until her hip heals 
the prognosis at this point should be excellent said 
borges we anticipate no problems 
zervas said mrs dukakis noticed immediate improvement when she 
woke up after the surgery 
she told me that the numbness and tingling she had all over 
her body had disappeared he said and that makes us feel 
good

former us rep sam steiger on friday was 
placed on four years probation and fined 5480 for pressuring a 
parole board member over an administrative matter while working for 
thengov evan mecham 
judge ronald reinstein of maricopa county superior court also 
ordered him to perform 700 hours of community service work and 
suggested steiger who is well known for criticizing lawyers 
consider spending some of those hours on arizona bar association 
projects 
steiger 59 was convicted april 7 of theft by extortion in 
threatening board of pardons and paroles member ron johnson over a 
personnel vote he could have been sentenced to up to five years in 
prison 
steiger claimed it was simply hardball politics but jurors at 
the sevenday trial agreed with the prosecution that steiger 
threatened johnsons parttime job as a justice of the peace in 
order to steal his vote on retention of the boards executive 
director 
steiger clashed repeatedly with attorney general bob corbin 
while a special assistant to mecham who has since been impeached 
he told the judge he was frustrated by problems at the parole 
board and could not say he regretted his actions even though 
prudence and precedence would dictate that i should be 
remorseful 
referring to interviews with corbin investigators he said i 
lied to the attorney general for the same reason that i would lie 
to a stickup man in an alley who asked me if i had any money 
what is important in this matter is that it is my absolute honest 
conviction that the attorney general singled me out for elimination 
from state government because i was critical of a serious problem 
in that office 
reinstein said he was impressed by the more than 170 letters on 
steigers behalf and said he did not believe steiger was motivated 
by political financial or personal gain 
but he said steiger clearly broke the law abused his power 
and was trying to deflect your obvious wrong in this case on 
others 
frankly mr steiger you came off as a bully reinstein 
said citing conversations that the parole board member secretly 
recorded 
steiger a former fiveterm congressman rancher and newspaper 
columnist has taken on his colleagues neighbors business 
associates former wife police highway officials and burros in a 
colorful career 
steiger began his political career at 28 as a republican when 
he won the first of two terms in the state senate from a 101 
democratic district 
the only reason a republican had never been elected was 
because nobody good had ever run he said later everybody 
laughed after all whos gonna vote for a new york jew 
horsetrader who was a republican on top of everything else 
in a 1968 television interview he referred to some of his 
congressional colleagues as dumb clucks i wouldnt hire to push a 
wheelbarrow in 1975 he shot and killed two burros that he said 
attacked him 
in 1979 steiger pointed a rifle at a man who tried to collect a 
debt at his ranch in 1982 he was convicted of disorderly conduct 
after directing abrasive and abusive language toward a highway 
patrol officer 
in 1986 he repainted a crosswalk that the state highway 
department had eliminated in downtown prescott and later beat a 
criminaldamage charge in the case 
as a special assistant to mecham the next year he was in charge 
of overseeing the highway department the crosswalk was painted 
again this time by highway crews

deputy police commissioner willie l 
williams is the first black to win the departments top job with 
the 24year police veteran pledging friday to carry on reforms 
begun by outgoing commissioner kevin tucker 
williams 44 will take over next week when tuckers resignation 
becomes effective he said he would prepare the department to 
enter the 21st century 
we will also have honor and integrity as the cornerstone of 
our every working hour williams said at a news conference where 
mayor w wilson goode announced his appointment 
tucker resigned last week after a 2year tenure marked by 
efforts to improve the credibility of a police force rocked by 
extortion scandals in recent years he had suggested williams and 
six other candidates for the job goode said 
the tenure of kevin tucker has represented the turning around 
of this department and the appointment of willie williams 
represents a continuation of the reform of the department goode 
said 
goode the citys first black mayor had said the new 
commissioner would come from within the department 
budget cuts have prompted speculation of layoffs in the police 
department and williams told reporters the patrol force on the 
street will not be cut that is our first priority 
city council president joseph coleman called the appointment 
magnificent he is a good man and is very qualified 
robert hurst president of the fraternal order of police lodge 
5 said the union was pleased especially that the mayor named 
someone from within who had worked his way up through the ranks 
williams who started with the 6700member department in 1964 
as a park guard was chosen by tucker as a deputy commissioner in 
that role he was responsible for the operations of the 
administrative training and staff services bureaus 
both williams and goode said the major task facing the police 
department is the fight against drugs and that the battle would be 
stepped up 
goode asked if appointing a black police commissioner would 
help the image of police in the black community responded that 
race was never a factor in this appointment i only sought to 
find the very best person 
he acknowledged however that in the black community which 
comprises about 40 percent of the citys population williams will 
be able to help turn around negative views of police 
tucker 47 a former head of the local us secret service 
office succeeded gregore sambor who resigned in the wake of the 
fatal may 1985 confrontation between police and the radical group 
move and was commissioner during federal investigations of 
extortion by police officers 
tucker took over a moraleshattered department that was reeling 
from extortion convictions against 34 officers or former officers 
including a deputy commissioner

cuba gave president reagan faint praise 
friday for his arms treaty with the soviet union but also said he 
is an implacable enemy and demanded the us navy base at 
guantanamo be returned 
king hussein of jordan told delegates to the special general 
assembly session on disarmament that israel poses a terrible 
threat to the middle east and the world with nuclear weapons 
israel neither confirms nor denies reports that it has nuclear arms 
cuban vice president carlos rafael rodriguez assailed 
washingtons military policies and economic embargo of his 
caribbean nation but rodriguez also said this weeks ussoviet 
summit in moscow and the treaty on eliminating intermediaterange 
nuclear missiles represents an auspicious sign for the un 
session 
we have the possibility of seeing a profound change in 
international political relations and the time when some us 
leaders thought their ends could be achieved through a policy of 
force and arrogance has given way to laborious systematic 
negotiations rodriguez said 
he said a positive response from the united states is required 
to accompany soviet initiatives and the international clamor for 
peace and the latest events seem to indicate that the reagan 
administration is heading in that direction 
if mr reagan takes the road to peace no matter how 
vacillating his manner or slow his steps cuba would not 
fail to recognize that positive attitude on his part rodriguez 
said 
he added however that cuba still considers him reagan its 
implacable adversary cannot forget his threats and is not yet free 
of his economic and political pressures 
rodriguez said military bases maintained by foreign powers 
constitute a virtual rental of national sovereignty of countries 
eaten away by poverty 
guantanamo is the most intolerable example of foreign 
military presence he said adding the us occupiers imposed it 
on our country and although our people are opposed it is still 
there and an insult to our national sovereignty 
cuba has not accepted it cannot accept it and will never 
accept it that part of our national territory should be returned 
to us 
the united states leased the base area on guantanamo bay for 99 
years in 1898 president fidel castros government refuses the 
nominal annual rent of 5000 
rodriguez said cuba has no offensive weapons and wants only the 
minimum armaments necessary to guarantee its own peace but must 
make its defense plans taking into account the uninterrupted 
hostility of the nearby united states 
that has forced us to turn the war waged by the army into a 
war of all the people involving old people housewives and 
children he said 
in a speech read by ambassador abdullah salah of jordan king 
hussein recommended strong un measures to keep the middle east 
free of nuclear weapons and halt israels alleged nuclear arms 
program 
the situation has become more dangerous since israel 
introduced nuclear weapons to the middle east salah said it 
has been building up its nuclear capabilities since the 1950s and 
is continuing to develop and expand them so that it now represents 
a terrible threat not only to the middle east but to the world as a 
whole

even for close friends it was an emotional 
farewell 
ronald reagan ending what was probably his last presidential 
visit to britain quoted poetry friday joked about his age 
recalled angloamerican alliances in war and peace and lavished 
praise on prime minister margaret thatcher 
and in the splendid setting of londons ancient guildhall seat 
of city government for 1000 years mrs thatcher responded you 
have restored faith in the american dream 
from red doubledecker buses the banks of the river thames and 
behind crowd barriers near the guildhall londoners waved to the 
us president as his motorcade wound through the capital toward 
the end of a 26hour stopover after the moscow summit 
eight british theater celebrities including actress julie 
christie staged a demonstration against us policy in latin 
america 
but the only serious booing came from a crowd that had waited as 
long as two hours outside the guildhall for the arrival of reagan 
and his wife nancy and had their view blocked at the last moment 
by a security van driven across the entrance to the courtyard 
the 77yearold reagan delivered a speech focused on eastwest 
relations before an audience of 500 redrobed city dignitaries 
political leaders and diplomats 
yet more than an political event the occasion was a high point 
in the special relationship between britain and america which has 
flourished under the two conservative leaders who have held office 
through the 1980s 
the audience gave reagan a standing ovation and replying to his 
speech mrs thatcher mixed praised for a political ally with 
affection for a departing friend 
your personal courage your gentle humor and your spirit of 
optimism are all part of the special quality that you have brought 
to the presidency said mrs thatcher 62 into her third term 
and expected to run for a fourth 
above all and in this you have done the greatest possible 
service not only to your own people but to free people everywhere 
you have restored faith in the american dream 
to a blast from golduniformed trumpeters reagan was escorted 
into the guildhalls great hall where towering statues of military 
heroes horatio nelson and the duke of wellington are set amid 
medieval stainedglass windows the stars and stripes and the red 
and white flag of st george englands patron saint hung from 
balconies 
the guildhall has been the scene of 16th century trials of 
traitors pleas to kings and parliament receptions for emperors 
and addresses by american presidents ulysses s grant and woodrow 
wilson 
i wonder if you can imagine what it is for an american to 
stand in this place said reagan 
back in the states we are terribly proud of anything more 
than a few hundred years old some even see my election to the 
presidency as americas attempt to show our european cousins that 
we too have a regard for antiquity he added to laughter 
after the jokes he concentrated on new hopes for peace and 
another arms control treaty and he intertwined history and 
anecdotes to depict britain the country that produced winston 
churchill writer evelyn waugh and a pubkeeper who hearing the 
visiting reagans accent 40 years ago recalled fondly the world 
war ii gis sent to britain from a place called ioway 
turning to mrs thatcher he said at this hour in our 
history prime minister the entire world salutes you and your 
gallant people and gallant nation 
british opposition labor party leader neil kinnock who 
advocates unilateral disarmament including shutting down us 
nuclear bases and who describes mrs thatcher as reagans 
poodle stared ahead expressionlessly from the rows of vips as 
the president denounced onesided disarmers 
kinnock said later of reagans tributes to mrs thatcher it 
was a generous and gentlemanly thing to do but i think thats 
about where it stops 
both reagan and mrs thatcher started out in office denouncing 
the soviet union and both changed their minds through arms control 
deals and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs new policies of 
openness both spoke friday of the dawn of new era of hope between 
east and west 
reagan concluded come my friends as it was said of old by 
tennyson it is not too late to seek a newer world 
responded mrs thatcher thank you mr president thank you 
for the summit thank you for your presidency thank you for your 
testament of belief and god bless america 
mrs thatcher said later that she hoped gorbachev would visit 
britain again in the spring or summer next year in an interview 
with independent television news the prime minister said he is 
willing to do it and it is a question of what is the best timing 
he will be very preoccupied with the changes going on in the 
soviet union 
kinnock later praised reagan in an independent television news 
interview he deserves very full credit from our generation and 
from future generations for making a positive response to 
gorbachevs initiatives 
asked whether he considered reagan a great president kinnock 
replied yes i think mrs thatcher may be engaging in a mutual 
match of hyperbole at the moment but it certainly is a highly 
creditable performance in order to begin an era of nuclear 
disarmament 
she has over these nearly eight years now followed every twist 
and turn and uturn of american policy he added the least she 
could expect is a public thank you from the president 
she earned it she deserved it from him and he gave it which 
was the presidential and gentlemanly thing to do

the moscow party leadership put prominent 
advocates of mikhail s gorbachevs reforms back on the ballot 
friday for a key national communist party conference the official 
soviet news agency tass reported 
it was a clear defeat for party conservatives 
the moscow party bureau sidestepped a decision of lower party 
organizations in the capital which had not submitted the names of 
the reform advocates as candidates for the 19th party conference 
scheduled to open june 28 
the conference is supposed to bolster gorbachevs reforms by 
approving a document published a week ago that outlines radical 
changes to remove remnants of stalinism from soviet politics and 
law but reforms could be in doubt if conservatives are predominant 
among delegates 
tass said gorbachev the party general secretary took part in 
the moscow committee meeting but did not say if he spoke in favor 
of the restored candidacies 
it did not say if those whose names were restored had been 
elected but the moscow party committee would be unlikely to buck a 
decision made by its supreme executive body the moscow party 
bureau 
sociologist tatyana zaslavskaya a leading proponent of 
perestroika gorbachevs program of economic and social 
restructuring assailed conservatives for maneuvering to block the 
election of reformers as conference delegates 
the most pronounced advocates of perestroika were not 
selected she told a news conference 
zaslavskaya had failed to receive enough votes to stand as a 
candidate for one of the 319 delegate spots to be filled from 
moscow but the moscow party bureau ordered her name to be put 
before the moscow party committee as a delegate candidate tass 
said 
other prominent perestroika advocates whose names were restored 
to the ballot included movie director elem klimov economist 
nikolai shmelev playwright mikhail shatrov and moscow news editor 
yegor yakovlev 
vitaly korotich editor of the weekly ogonyok said this week 
that fridays meeting might revise some delegate selections to 
include reformers like himself taken off the slate in 
preconference maneuvering 
tass said friday night that korotich was elected as a conference 
delegate from the regional party committee in the ukrainian black 
sea port city of kherson 
zaslavskaya korotich economist abel aganbegyan historian yuri 
afanasyev and writer fyodor burlatsky were among popular reformers 
voted in as party delegates from their place of work but axed at 
the next level the equivalent of precincts 
dissident andrei d sakharov told a news conference this week 
that gorbachev should be given time and trust to continue his 
pioneering reforms 
im very much concerned with the antidemocratic actions and 
the role the district party committees are playing in the elections 
to the 19th party conference sakharov said this is a direct 
attack on perestroika 
tass quoted moscow party boss lev n zaikov as telling the 
friday meeting that the party leadership decided to put the 
additional names on the ballot because moscow party organizations 
and work collectives wanted to choose only their own members as 
delegates 
zaikov said party leaders in the capital wanted the delegation 
to represent the interests of the city as a whole 
tass said fridays meeting elected 319 champions of 
perestroika to represent moscow at the conference but identified 
only a small number gorbachev zaikov the no 2 man in the 
kremlin yegor k ligachev and four other members of the national 
leadership 
the delegate battle has been the talk of moscow for days as 
staterun media and even street protests brought an internal party 
battle over reform into the open 
according to party sources there will be roughly one delegate 
for every 3800 communist party members at the conference the 19th 
in party history but the first since 1941

the united states should have used military 
force to remove gen manuel antonio noriega from power in panama 
and missed its opportunity to go in there and snatch him the 
chairman of the house armed services committee said friday 
i think it may be too late to use force now because hes 
moving around said rep les aspin dwis 
you dont know where he is what we should have done at the 
very beginning was use military force not blowing a lot of people 
up but to go in there and snatch him and take him out 
aspin was interviewed on john mclaughlins one on one 
syndicated television program taped for showing this weekend 
aspin answered affirmatively when mclaughlin asked whether he 
favored surgically removing noriega who has been indicted by 
the united states on drug charges 
you cant do it so easily now because theyre on their 
guard aspin said hes got guards hes protected hes moving 
around at least if you know where he is its a whole 
different problem and i think thats where we are now 
aspin also said that the mediumrange missile treaty on which 
president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev this week 
exchanged ratification documents is a small step but a small 
step in the wrong direction 
the wisconsin congressman says he opposes that treaty because 
while it eliminates some nuclear weapon it leaves an imbalance of 
conventional arms 
but he called the ussoviet summit in moscow a success because 
reagan called attention to human rights issues by talking to 
dissidents and visiting monasteries

following are excerpts from fridays news 
conference by andrei d sakharov as translated from russian into 
english by a soviet foreign ministry official 
on reforms ordered by soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
the country has entered into the decisive stage of perestroika 
restructuring of soviet economy and society thats a very 
complicated one and a very contradictory stage of perestroika and i 
dont think it would be an exaggeration to say that this is a 
dangerous stage in perestroika 
perestroika is an historical inevitability because there is no 
other alternative to the phenomena of stagnation in this country 
the lagging behind in terms of scientific and technological 
advances 
the glasnost increased openness in certain areas effort is 
very important but i still have a lot of apprehensions important 
laws that have been passed over the past 12 months or so which 
pertain to the economy such laws as those on the state enterprise 
and cooperatives individual labor activity to my mind still have 
the imprint of political compromise lack of elaboration and haste 
it seems to me the ice has been broken and there is no going 
back to stalinism any more i think the opponents of perestroika 
understand that too 
on the moscow summit 
the talks which ended between the soviet and american leaders 
were important in the view of promoting sovietamerican relations 
and in ensuring a better atmosphere of trust and confidence 
the main thing which is important to everyone is the prospect of 
halving strategic nuclear weapons im sure in talking about the 
50percent cuts an agreement is possible without any connection to 
the sdi problem sdi the reagan administrations strategic 
defense initiative known as the star wars program is a plan for a 
spacebased antimissile defense system 
i subscribe to cutting the military service in the soviet union 
in all the arms i suggest that it be halved corresponding to the 
reduction in armaments though probably the number of officers 
should not be reduced that drastically of course thats a 
responsible decision but that step would be very important for the 
overall situation internationally and that would help promote 
disarmament and detente 
on afghanistan 
now on the soviet troops withdrawal from afghanistan thats a 
major historical development i believe the soviet troop withdrawal 
should go on in any conditions no matter the actions of the rebels 
in afghanistan 
all the residents of afghanistan should be given the right to 
ask for political asylum in the soviet union and in other 
countries so that they can be sure they will survive 
the introduction of soviet troops in afghanistan in 1979 was a 
major mistake one of the results of the democracy effort in the 
soviet union should be a situation where such mistakes will be 
impossible to make in the future 
on human rights 
all the prisoners of conscience in the soviet union should be 
set free without any declaration on their part in 1987 when they 
were requested to ask for pardon it was not a legitimate action i 
think all those released should be rehabilitated otherwise when 
these people are considered having been given a pardon this 
preserves the situation where they were allegedly tried on a 
legitmate basis 
here is another legislative problem this is the right to freely 
choose the country of residence this should not be reduced to the 
family reunion issue full implementation of the right to choose 
freely the place of residence emigration coming back ensured by 
legislative acts will have vast imporatnce for this society to 
remain open

president reagan returned home from his moscow 
summit to a campaignstyle starspangled welcome friday and said 
his talks with mikhail s gorbachev would prove good and 
promising for the future 
peace and freedom are what this trip was about and we saw some 
real progress in several areas in moscow the president said 
moments after stepping off air force one his memorable 11000mile 
journey at an end 
he claimed progress on human rights regional conflicts and 
tangible progress toward a new arms control treaty even 
though his talks with gorbachev produced no breakthrough on a new 
pact 
reagan and his wife nancy were greeted by vice president george 
bush and his wife barbara as they stepped off their plane onto a 
red carpet 
the scene at andrews air force base was as meticulously 
orchestrated as any in reagans two terms in the white house a 
receiving line of dignitaries several thousand invited guests 
waving small american flags and a marine band playing ruffles and 
flourishes and the national anthem 
as far as nancy and i are concerned theres no place like 
home reagan said as the audience cheered 
the president pronounced himself and his wife as weary 
travelers and he seemed to lose his place once while reading his 
prepared remarks 
he touched on many of the same themes he raised several hours 
earlier in a speech in london 
there the president said his summit talks with gorbachev may 
have begun dismantling cold war barriers but he vowed america will 
remain wary and strong as it seeks lasting changes in soviet 
policies 
assessing his first visit to the kremlin before an applauding 
audience of british admirers reagan said he found gorbachev to be 
a serious man seeking serious reform and believed the 
superpowers may be entering a new era of history 
although the soviet leader had expressed disappointment over the 
lack of major summit achievements reagan said in his london speech 
friday that there had been tangible progress toward treaty 
agreement for a drastic reduction in stockpiles of strategic 
nuclear weapons 
such a treaty is i believe now within our grasp he 
said 
but a senior reagan adviser national security adviser colin 
powell seemed somewhat more cautious in speakling with reporters 
during the long flight home from england 
powell said the ussoviet relationshiop is nowe solidly in 
place but said there are major differences blocking the way to a 
comprehensive arms control treaty we have to take this slowly 
he said in the next six months the next six years if you dont 
come home with a treaty that the experts the congress dont see 
as strong itll never be ratified 
the president made no prediction of a treaty agreement in his 
remarks in washington and did not mention the possibility of a 
future summit with gorbachev before his term ends next january 
reagan noted that he and gorbachev exchanged ratification 
documents in moscow for the pact they agreed to last december and 
ticked off several other accomplishments of his five days in moscow 
all of this was good and promising for the future he said 
the events of this week in moscow were momentous not 
conclusive perhaps but momentous you know its occurred to me 
that time does have a way of sorting things out he said 
much is happening in the soviet union reagan said we 
hope and pray that the signs of change continue there 
bush who spoke briefly noted that reagan had raised the touchy 
issue of human rights in remarks in the soviet union and said 
whats wrong with telling the other guy how you feel the fact 
is you made us proud 
that was as close as bush got to touching on reagans 
controversial comment made in moscow that soviet emigration 
policies may be the result of bureaucratic bungling rather than 
kremlin policies 
the reagans welcome home and andrews was watched by 4000 
members of the republican national committee congressional 
families white house staff members and their families and 
political appointees more than twodozen 7thgraders from the 
drane middle school in corsicana texas wearing blueandwhite and 
redandwhite rugby shirts waved small american flags 
the first couple also got a cheer when they arrived at the white 
house where mrs reagan picked up their dog rex and gave him a 
hug and kisses the president picked up a 3yearold boy jeffrey 
ryan duberstein son of kenneth duberstein the deputy white house 
chief of staff 
in his england speech reagan portrayed gorbachev in warm 
personal terms yet served notice he will not be pressured into 
abandoning his campaign of speaking out against human rights abuses 
in the soviet union 
in matters of state unless the truth be spoken it ceases to 
exist reagan said in a speech in the medieval guildhall in 
central london attended by prime minister margaret thatcher 
even on the human rights issue the president seemed to 
exonerate gorbachev who has allowed increased emigration by soviet 
jews since he assumed power in 1985 
reagan said human rights abuses were a defect of the soviet 
system and have been going on for a number of years 
you cant place the blame on any individual he said 
in a seemingly mellow mood for a longtime anticommunist who 
once described the soviet union as an evil empire reagan 
offered gorbachev encouragement in his reform policies of glasnost 
or openness in society and the economic restructuring known as 
perestroika 
but he warned western allies that any assessment of ussoviet 
relations during an uncertain time of change must be tempered by 
prudence and caution 
let us embrace honest change when it occurs reagan said 
but let us also be wary let us stay strong 
the president received sustained applause from the royal 
institute of international affairs and lavish praise from mrs 
thatcher who predicted that the moscow summit will influence the 
course of history for years to come 
the summit has brought us closer to the more stable and 
peaceful relations between east and west that we all want to see 
she said indeed i believe there is more hope between east and 
west than ever before 
in a splendid show of british pomp reagan was escorted into the 
woodpaneled guildhall the 1000yearold cradle of english civic 
government by ceremonial sword and mace bearers who had led him 
through a corridor guarded by lord mayor sir greville spratts 
personal guard of pikemen and musketeers 
quite possibly we are beginning to take down the barriers of 
the postwar era reagan said in his speech quite possibly we 
are entering a new era in history a time of lasting change in the 
soviet union 
we will have to see but if so it is because of the 
steadfastness of the allies the democracies for more than 40 
years and especially in this decade 
the president said his dealings with the soviets were based on 
a new postwar strategy of speaking out about fundamental 
political and moral differences between the superpowers and 
pursuing vigorous diplomatic engagement 
it is he said a policy that rejects both the inevitability 
of war or the permanence of totalitarian rule a policy based on 
realism that seeks not just treaties for treaties sake but the 
recognition and resolution of fundamental differences with our 
adversaries

a policeman held hostage by two armed 
exconvicts for almost nine hours last month says that at times his 
captors were so congenial he felt as if he were on a fishing trip 
with friends 
there was one problem officer larry g strayer said they 
had guns and they were pointed at my head 
at one point strayer convinced he was about to die told his 
captors to make it quick he said in an interview published 
friday in the oregonian he also said he wondered whether he had 
bought enough life insurance to provide for his wife his 
21yearold daughter and 18yearold son 
but he also said his natural gift for gab and experience as 
a prison guard helped him get along with his captors and buy time 
until he was able to escape 
albert w reinhart 42 and michael r ager 37 of tacoma 
wash held strayer at gunpoint after he went to their motel room 
may 12 to look for a man sought for a supermarket robbery 
strayer 43 finally escaped after the two men fell asleep and 
he grabbed reinharts gun fatally shot reinhart and wounded ager 
ager who had said throughout the night that he would not go 
back to prison refused to give up even then he later shot himself 
and died after police fired tear gas into the room 
the two men both heroin addicts told strayer they had robbed 
the store to get drug money 
during the ordeal strayer a former guard at san quentin prison 
in california forced himself to joke and talk with his captors 
they thought like cons and acted like cons he said 
because of my background ive learned how to establish a rapport 
with a convict its a knack i never lost ive got a natural gift 
for gab and thats what i did that night while i figured out how 
to escape 
they werent verbally abusive and they had not manhandled 
me he said it was like three buddies had gone fishing 
somewhere 
strayer was taken hostage after he had handcuffed reinhart as a 
suspect in the robbery suddenly ager was pointing a gun at 
strayers head about 7 feet away and he ordered two other officers 
at the scene to leave 
i couldnt believe it strayer said i was looking right 
down the barrel of the gun i mean i could see the bullet in the 
cylinder i put my hands up slowly and said dont shoot me 
when the lateevening news came on the captors learned that the 
bureaus special emergency response team had surrounded the motel 
strayer recalled 
they come through that door and youre dead reinhart told 
strayer 
he had another hairraising moment after the captors first fell 
asleep about 3 am strayer was ready to bolt for the door when 
the phone rang it was a hostage negotiator who told reinhart the 
drugs that the captors had demanded would not be delivered 
i thought to myself tough luck strayer recalled it 
dawned on me how asleep he had been 
strayer finally got out about an hour later when the pair were 
sleeping again 
im a police officer i shot them he shouted as he left the 
motel room he was hustled into a police van across the street 
where he used a mobile phone to call his wife 
i was crying everyone in the van was crying he said i 
told her i was out and ok it was all over

most of the cabinet and thousands of cheering 
supporters gave president reagan a bandplaying flagwaving 
welcome back from the summit friday and he told them theres no 
place like home 
reagan and his wife nancy arrived at andrews air force base from 
the moscow meeting with mikhail gorbachev and a stopover in london 
and were greeted by a cheering crowd that jammed into hangar 3 at 
the invitation of the white house 
their applause reached a peak as the president walked down the 
ramp of air force one and was greeted by vice president george bush 
and a majority of his cabinet 
more than 20 7thgraders from the drane middle school in 
corsicana texas waved flags and held up signs one of which 
proclaimed another one for the gipper 
the white house invited 4000 members of the republican national 
committee congressional staff members political appointees and 
their families and servicemen all but a few seats in bleachers 
that lined the hangar walls were filled 
as some of you may have heard mr gorbachev and i have been 
trading russian proverbs this week reagan said at the beginning 
of his arrival address 
but you know flying back across the atlantic today it was an 
american saying that kept running through my mind believe me as 
far as nancy and i are concerned theres no place like home 
gazing at the people many of whom were dressed in red and white 
or blue and white reagan declared all this red white and blue 
scenery hits these two weary travelers right where we live 
reagan said were a little tired and he looked it 
but were exhilarated at what has happened exhilarated too at 
the thought of the future and what may lie ahead for the young 
people of america and all the world 
the white house had hoped to hold the arrival gala outside but 
the threat of rain caused a switch in plans and the rally was held 
in the hangar used in recent years for such occasions it was in 
the same spot in the early 1970s that president nixon was greeted 
by a crowd of wellwishers on his return from the first 
presidential trip to china 
bush whom reagan has endorsed in this years presidential 
election stood with reagan on a raised podium and said welcome 
home and well done 
he lauded reagan for urging gorbachev during the talks in moscow 
to improve human rights conditions in the soviet union and the 
vice president said whats wrong with telling the other guy how 
you feel 
before reagans arrival organizers of the event handed out 
small american flags to the people in the audience and a 39member 
air force band played martial music to warm up the crowd

the united states and soviet union will 
conduct their annual review of procedures to avoid incidents on the 
high seas during meetings in moscow next week the pentagon said 
friday 
the annual review and consultation session will take place 
sunday through friday the pentagon said it is being held in 
moscow this year under a normal rotating schedule 
the annual review is called for by the agreement on prevention 
of incidents on and over the high seas which was signed in moscow 
in 1972 
the purpose of the agreement is to improve safety on and over 
the high seas by review and discussion of all bilateral incidents 
at sea between the parties by strict observance of the 
international rules of the road and by use of special signals 
between naval units of both countries the pentagon said 
a defense official speaking only on condition of anonymity said 
us representatives expected to discuss several recent incidents 
during the meeting including one in the black sea in which two 
soviet ships deliberately bumped two american vessels in a bid to 
force them to a new course 
also likely to be discussed is an incident that occurred over 
the pacific ocean when an air force pilot in a surveillance plane 
observing a russian missile test was blinded temporarily by what 
was believed to be a soviet laser

the soviet union says more of its un 
staff members will become permanent civil servants which addresses 
a problem the united states has cited in withholding dues payments 
soviet practice has been for its nationals on the un staff to 
serve five years or less us officials say that makes them 
inclined to favor soviet policy over an impartial un agenda 
because they will be returning to the soviet civil service 
a united nations staff member said friday that the international 
organization will be broke by the end of september unless new funds 
are obtained president reagan needs to certify that us 
objections have been met before 44 million not paid for 1987 can 
be released for the un 
the staff member speaking on condition his name not be used 
said that another solution would be for the soviets to pay the 
second half of their annual assessment early the soviet union 
usually pays in october 
vladimir petrovsky a soviet deputy foreign minister told a 
moscow news conference the most competent and experience soviet 
members of the secretariat will be able to serve on the basis 
of permanent contracts 
an english translation of petrovskys remarks delivered may 19 
was made available to the associated press at the united nations on 
friday the un information office in moscow sent the text to new 
york 
the united states has withheld 44 million of the 144 million 
it allocated for dues in 1987 partly because it said soviet un 
personnel should be independent international civil servants 
americas total assessment is 25 percent of the budget 
on friday the un staff member called petrovskys comment 
the 44 million paragraph in the news conference text which 
covered such other topics as ussoviet relations and the current 
special general assembly session on disarmament 
an american official said privately the petrovsky statement 
appeared to remove the last substantial us objection to paying 
it removes a lot of doubts agreed sergei komolov press 
attache for the soviet delegation to the disarmament session 
komolov suggested the announcement in moscow went unnoticed 
because few foreign correspondents attended the briefing the 
main press center was being renovated for the summit and perhaps 
many reporters were not familiar with the room where the news 
conference was held he said 
reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev met in moscow this 
week their fourth summit 
both the us official and the un staff member said the other 
two conditions for releasing the money are being satisfied a 15 
percent cut in the secretariat staff and a greater voice in the 
budget process for large contributors 
staff cuts are being implemented and last year a budget review 
committee was created that must approve the budget by consensus 
the united states is a member of the committee giving it an 
effective veto of budget decisions 
congress imposed the three conditions last year as part of the 
us budget appropriation reagan is required to give congress an 
annual evaluation of progress toward the goals

amalienborg palace the coalition includes schlueters conservative 
party which has 35 seats in the 179member parliament the 
liberals with 22 and the social liberals with 10 
schlueter called his coalition the best foundation in a 
difficult situation for stability in domestic and foreign 
affairs denmark has not had a majority government since 1971 
the way was cleared for the coalition when the parties agreed on 
a method of reminding denmarks north atlantic treaty organization 
allies of its 31yearold policy barring nuclear weapons danish 
radio said 
schlueter had refused to carry out an april 14 resolution by 
parliament requiring the government to notify visiting warships of 
the policy and called the may 10 election as a referendum on the 
issue 
schlueter would not say how he resolved the matter but told 
reporters he would explain it tuesday in a speech to parliament 
the radio said he chose the norwegian model under which 
denmarks nonnuclear status would be mentioned in diplomatic 
contacts before a port call but notification would not be sent to 
captains as ships entered the harbor 
the united states and britain the two nuclear powers in the 
alliance military command had said notifying ships might 
compromise the policy of not acknowledging the locations of nuclear 
arms

us secretary of state george p shultz 
made an appeal friday for arabs and israelis to stop their 
winnertakeall competition and negotiate within the framework 
of an american peace plan for the middle east 
shultz told reporters on a flight from london that he has seen 
no progress as he launched his fourth mideast shuttle this year 
but that doesnt mean i should stop he added 
upon arriving in the egyptian capital friday shultz released a 
fivepage statement saying the root of the arabisraeli conflict 
is the competition between two national movements for one land 
he said neither the palestinians nor the israelis seem able to 
abandon prejudices hatred and overblown dreams in favor of a 
negotiated settlement 
shultz urged compromise saying arabs and israelis are not 
engaged in a winnertakeall competition a fair settlement is 
possible 
despite the impasse room exists for israelis and palestinians 
to live sidebyside in israel the west bank and gaza shultz 
said he gave no support to creation of a palestinian state nor 
did he set a deadline for the parties to respond to his renewed 
appeal 
on his last trip two months ago shultz tried to persuade 
israel jordan and the palestinians to accept the plan by midapril 
and join in a peace conference on may 1 all three parties 
informally rejected the proposal without putting their views in 
writing 
were going to keep working on this and all of the parties 
seem to keep wanting me to come shultz said as soon as you 
send out the word you might come they say welcome come they 
see its important to keep trying to find a way to peace 
but when asked if attitudes have changed shultz said i dont 
have any particularly indications of movement anywhere but that 
doesnt mean i should stop the situation is that the problems are 
of great importance 
he met for an hour with foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid and 
will see president hosni mubarak on saturday 
shultzs fiveday mission will take him to egypt jordan israel 
and syria for talks on the us peace plan and a bit of 
sightseeing he had gone to london with president reagan after the 
moscow summit 
shultz said the soviets seemed to have softened their stand on a 
international middle east peace conference by no longer insisting 
that it be authoritative 
in his airborne news conference shultz said the soviets now use 
the word effective to describe the conference he is trying to 
set up to deal first with palestinian selfrule then an overall 
settlement 
prime minister yitzhak shamir has opposed peace talks that might 
let the soviets assist positions of their arab allies it was not 
clear whether the slight change shultz said he detected could 
influence shamir 
shultz is making cairo his base for the talks and spending all 
four nights in the egyptian capital 
he scheduled only a threehour visit to jordan on saturday and a 
trip to israel on sunday 
shultz will meet with king hussein in amman and with shamir 
foreign minister shimon peres and defense minister yitzhak rabin 
in jerusalem 
in egypt shultz also planned to visit the ancient tombs in 
luxor 
rabin told a group of projordanian palestinians from the west 
bank on monday night that the shultz visit has come too late the 
financial times reported 
the london daily quoted one participant as saying rabin told the 
group that a serious initiative could not resume before next june 
after the new governments to be elected this year in israel and the 
united states have settled in 
hussein is withholding support for the plan unless he is 
guaranteed israels withdrawal from the west bank which jordan 
held from 1948 until 1967 
hussein also has declined to speak for the palestinian arabs 
15 million of whom live on the west bank and in the gaza strip 
israel captured the areas in the 1967 middle east war 
the israeli army put 190000 palestinians under restrictions 
friday to prevent violence on the opening day of a threeday strike 
called to protest shultzs visit

a cypriot freighter was reported to have 
been freed by iran on friday and allowed to continue its voyage the 
day after it was boarded and seized apparently on suspicion of 
carrying warrelated cargo 
the 10000ton motor vessel vevey left the iranian port bandar 
abbas at midday and was proceeding normally to its destinations 
in the persian gulf according to the lloyds shipping intelligence 
unit in london 
the brief report which lloyds said was provided by the 
shipowners gave no details 
an iranian frigate tentatively identified by us naval 
officials as the 1540ton alborz intercepted the vevey on thursday 
as it entered the gulf bound for saudi arabia and kuwait with a 
listed cargo of italian marble chips and powder 
iranian naval personnel boarded the ship and forced it o 
accompany the frigate to bandar abbas site of a major iranian 
naval base lloyds said 
iran frequently stops commercial vessels in the southern gulf to 
search them for contraband or militaryrelated cargo bound for 
iraq it also sometimes takes the ships into custody for further 
investigation 
such boardings are legal under international maritime law in 
wartime circumstances such as the gulf where iraq and iran have 
been at war for almost eight years 
in seizing the vevey iran appeared to risk a confrontation with 
the us navy missile cruiser vincennes which was on patrol two 
miles away 
us officers said the cruiser could have intervened if the 
veveys captain decided he was being attacked and radioed for help 
the officers would not speculate whether the iranians were 
purposely trying to defy the vincennes a hightech aegistype 
cruiser on its first patrol after arriving in the gulf last weekend 
under expanded rules of engagement that became effective a month 
ago us warships can intervene in attacks on nonus flag ships 
provided the ships ask for help and are in international waters 
outside the war exclusion zones declared by iran and iraq 
iranian gunboats have conducted four raids on neutral shipping 
since the new policy took effect but in areas where patrolling 
us warships were too far away to have intervened if asked 
the belgian government announced friday in brussels it was 
recalling one of its two warships in the gulf the mine sweeper 
commandsupport vessel zinnia that will dissolve a belgiandutch 
unit formed in september 
belgium and the netherlands each sent three minesweeping craft 
to the gulf as part of a multinational effort to clear the waterway 
of mines laid by iran

a veterinarian spent 26 days in jail before 
convincing drug authorities that he isnt his brother who has been 
indicted on cocaine smuggling charges 
rafael rocasuarez gained his freedom at a hearing thursday 
before us magistrate william turnoff 
an honest mistake turnoff called it 
he ordered rocasuarezs release on a 100000 personal surety 
bond and gave prosecutors and us drug enforcement administration 
agents three weeks to make a few final checks on the situation 
rocasuarezs wife patricia said it was at least the second 
time her husband has suffered from mistaken identity with his 
lookalike brother renato she said her husband was detained in 
panama in 1983 until a dea agent was flown in to say he was the 
wrong man 
the same dea agent rich vandiver had to be flown to miami from 
south america for the hearing thursday 
renato rocasuarez a pilot is charged in a 1980 federal 
indictment with conspiracy to import 854 pounds of cocaine from 
bolivia to the united states 
rafael rocasuarez was arrested last month in houston at a may 
9 court hearing there the 40yearold rafael testified that his 
brother renato who is a year and a half younger is the man 
authorities were seeking but dea agent david gorman misidentified 
rafael as renato and rafael was sent to miami to face trial 
the case was going forward based on a belief that rafael was 
renato but defense attorneys met privately with mark schnapp 
chief of the criminal division of the us attorneys office in 
miami to show him military records photos of the two brothers 
together and newspaper articles about renato who they said was 
still in bolivia schnapp said he questioned rafael outside court 
and was satisfied that he had veterinary training 
by then schnapp said he was convinced that the us government 
had to reexamine the question of identity

a military court indicted fernando

analisis and one of its reporters friday on charges of slandering 
the navy 
prosecutor miguel munoz a navy captain indicted paulsen and 
ivan badilla the reporter who wrote the article in question which 
dealt with the navys purchase of eight frenchmade helicopters and 
suggested it overpaid 
both were arrested tuesday in this port city 80 miles northwest 
of santiago the capital if found guilty they could receive 
prison sentences of up to 10 years 
juan pablo cardenas publisher of the magazine was detained for 
five days last week but released without charges a navy statement 
said he still was under investigation 
the analisis article said the cost of the helicopters should 
have been 36 million but the navy paid 217 million 
it said there were unconfirmed reports that two reconaissance 
aircraft were included in the deal and some of the money may have 
been spent on support gear but that would not account for a 
difference of 181 million

many oregon farmers are passing out false 
documents to help illegal aliens get around the new immigration law 
in an effort to retain a supply of cheap labor leaders of a 
farmworkers union alleged friday 
the victims are an estimated 20000 destitute migrant workers 
who have flooded oregon this spring said cipriano ferrel and larry 
kleinman of northwest treeplanters and farmworkers united 
word had spread among pickers that many farmers in the state 
would prepare fraudulent documents for workers who want to qualify 
for legal standing under the 1986 immigration reform act the union 
activists said at a news conference here 
they said farmers in the willamette valley are doing everything 
they can to keep workers unorganized the result is an 
overabundance of labor for the strawberry harvest which begins in 
a few days 
we see this as a concerted effort by the growers kleinman 
said its rampant 
under the 1986 act aliens who want to be employed as migrant 
farm workers must prove they worked 90 days in the fields between 
may 1 1985 and april 30 1986 
kleinman said the union had a list of 30 valley growers 
suspected of issuing fraudulent documentation including one farm 
that claimed that each worker put in exactly the same number of 
days on the harvest he declined to name the farms 
matthew unger chairman of the oregon strawberry commission a 
growers group said he hadnt heard of any grower filling out 
documents fraudulently 
i dont think anyone is trying to flood the market with them 
he said of the migrant workers we dont want to pay a 
high price for picking but were not trying to drive it down 
either 
other farmers however have said they have heard of growers who 
charge high fees to prepare false immigration papers strawberry 
farmer doug krahmer of cornelius said he has heard of growers 
charging as much as 400 
the migrant workers many of whom are from mexico and central 
america are eligible to return to the united states in future 
years to harvest crops once they qualify as special agricultural 
workers under the immigration law 
upon questioning the workers it becomes apparent that many no 
idea what the forms say kleinman said 
if you ask the workers what they did and when some workers 
will say i picked cucumbers in november and i picked strawberries 
in april kleinman said now we know thats not possible 
since the crops werent harvested during those months 
kleinman said immigration officials were turning their backs 
on the problem but immigration and naturalization service district 
director david beebe disagreed 
he said that 25 percent to 50 percent of the applicants coming 
to the portland office are suspected of carrying fraudulent 
documents the agency is investigating the situation but doesnt 
want to disclose details of its efforts he said friday 
ferrel said that in the past two weeks 80 percent of the 
migrants coming to the union offices for assistance have carried 
fraudulent documents given to them by growers or their agents such 
as labor contractors 
as a result the union has stopped helping workers apply for 
legalization ferrel said although it still will refer people to 
other organizations for assistance 
the crush of migrants in the region is testing the limits of 
relief agencies in much of northwestern oregon 
ferrel likened the situation to slavery and kleinman added if 
this isnt like south africa i dont know what is

major employers sought court 
orders friday in an effort to block a threeday protest called for 
next week by black trade unions that is expected to become a 
general strike 
in other developments friday a white antiapartheid activist 
disputed the governments contention that no youngsters under the 
age of 16 are being detained without charge under emergencyrule 
decrees 
and the government announced it would seek authority from the 
supreme court to evict 1800 people from a township where blacks 
have lived for 40 years 
unions are barred by law from advocating strikes not related to 
contract disputes south africas two largest black labor 
federations left it up to their affiliates to decide how to respond 
to a call for a protest to begin monday 
the congress of south african trade unions and the national 
council of trade unions representing an estimated of 14 million 
black workers joined forces to protest a new labor bill they say 
would cripple their unions by curtailing their ability to strike 
employers are not prepared to put effective pressure on the 
government unless their interests are directly affected 
congress general secretary jay naidoo told a news conference we 
believe if our members do take protest action some of that action 
will affect their the employers interests 
demonstrations are also planned over the next two weeks against 
the 2yearold state of emergency decreed on june 12 and the june 
16 anniversary of the 1976 riots in the black township of soweto 
in their legal action the employers asked the courts for 
injunctions against union officials participating in any unlawful 
strike or job action 
max coleman of the detainees parents support committee 
challenged the claim last week by law and order minister adriaan 
vlok that no children younger than 16 were being held under 
stateofemergency regulations 
coleman released a statement listing the names of six black 
detainees he said were 15 years old he said others were under 16 
when they were picked up and turned 16 in detention 
vlok said colemans statement reveals the shocking and chaotic 
condition of the information that he has at his disposal and which 
he and other radical persons use to vilify south africa 
in his statement coleman said some children had been held for 
more than a year without being charged 
he said about 2500 people are in detention under emergency 
regulations including about 250 youths under 18 
colemans committee is one of 17 antiapartheid organizations 
banned in february from any activity whatsoever 
the government went to court to enforce its planned eviction of 
1800 people from the black township of lawaaikamp near the white 
city of george east of cape town it said the move does not 
contradict its declaration that the policy of forced removals for 
racial separation ended in 1984 
carel du plessis the george town clerk said friday the 
evictions will be carried out under a law giving the municipality 
authority over use of its land 
lawaaikamp residents at a meeting thursday claimed the 
government was reversing its policy because they would be forced to 
move to make way for the development of a township for people of 
mixedrace 
du plessis said the residents would be given notices beginning 
june 7 telling them of the citys plans to seek supreme court 
approval for eviction orders 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

sen paul simon said friday he hopes to 
retain some influence over his eroding base of delegates to the 
democratic national convention but acknowledged he cannot control 
the delegates 
the illinois senator who put his presidential campaign on hold 
nearly two months ago still has some 150 delegates but has lost 
more than 30 in the last three weeks most of whom have defected to 
democratic frontrunner michael dukakis 
im pleased that the huge majority of them are holding off 
doing anything he said i think we want to do what we can to 
stick together and be a force for good at the convention 
i dont think anyone controls delegates but i think you 
can have some influence 
simon speaking at a news conference said he plans to meet with 
dukakis after tuesdays final four primaries to discuss topics 
including the selection of a vice presidential candidate 
he all but ruled out accepting the vice presidential nomination 
himself saying he would consider it only if some specific 
responsibilities were spelled out 
im frankly not interested in spending four years cutting 
ribbons and attending state funerals simon said 
he declined to speculate on jesse jacksons potential as a vice 
presidential candidate but listed three us senators he said 
dukakis might consider 
if mike dukakis goes the traditional route and recognizes 
that the principal contribution a vice president may make is in 
bringing in one state then the two obvious choices i think are 
john glenn in ohio and lloyd bentsen in texas simon said 
he said he doesnt see a similar vice presidential prospect in 
california but went on to praise arkansas sen dale bumpers who 
for a time was simons choice for president 
if you look at the number of electoral votes in the state of 
arkansas he isnt a logical candidate but i think there are other 
reasons he should be considered simon said

an unreleased clark county fire 
department report cites more than a dozen violations in storing a 
volatile rocket fuel oxidizer at a kerrmcgee chemical corp plant 
the report obtained by the las vegas reviewjournal cites 
violations in the storage of ammonium perchlorate and imprudent 
handling of flammable toxic chemicals and gases used in its 
production 
it is this departments opinion that many of the chemicals 
including ammonium perchlorate stored andor handled at the 
kerrmcgee facility are not being stored andor handled in 
compliance with nationally recognized standards said the report 
quoted friday by the newspaper 
kerrmcgee spokeswoman anita bridges said the company had hired 
a fire safety consultant robert van dolah of pittsburgh after 
receiving the report tuesday van dolah arrived in henderson 
thursday night and met with fire officials friday to address their 
concerns ms bridges said 
the company is saying that if there are problems with safety 
at the plant were going to fix them ms bridges said friday 
afternoon were going to make sure that plants operating 
safely 
a highranking fire department source told the newspaper the 
department will lobby against renewed production of ammonium 
perchlorate until kerrmcgee reduces safety risks 
the kerrmcgee plant in henderson halted production of ammonium 
perchlorate may 12 following an explosion a week earlier at nearby 
pacific engineering and production co kerrmcgee and pepcon were 
the only plants in the country producing the oxidizer used in the 
space shuttle and military rockets 
meanwhile nevada sen harry reid said the handwriting is on 
the wall and plants that produce hazardous materials may have to 
move out of the henderson industrial complex 
reid said consideration must be given to relocating such plants 
in the aftermath of the pepcon explosion 
reid made his comments in addressing 100 residents of the green 
valley subdivision thursday night green valley was one of the 
areas hardest hit by the explosion that killed two people injured 
326 and caused 73 million in property damage 
the senator first said he was sure the kerrmcgee plant would 
remain in henderson if it is found to be safe but he later said 
concerns by local residents and government officials might force 
the relocation of plants such as kerrmcgee and others that make 
combustible materials

no deathrow inmate should be left to face 
execution without a lawyer a federal appeals court ruled friday 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals overturned a december 1987 
ruling by own of its own threejudge panels that denied such access 
to the appeals process to inmates 
in virginia unlike most other states inmates who cannot afford 
an attorney and have no volunteer counsel have no guarantee of 
legal assistance once their sentences have been affirmed by the 
state supreme court 
jonathan sasser a durham nc attorney said fridays 64 
opinion apparently is the first time the right to counsel after 
sentencing has been upheld by a federal appeals court 
its an access to the courts issue said sasser who is 
among the lawyers representing as a class all indigent virginia 
deathrow inmates who are without personal volunteer attorneys 
for a deathrow inmate in virginia it means you have to have a 
living breathing attorney to represent you 
gerald zerkin a richmond attorney involved in the case said 
the ruling resolves a very difficult situation in which men on 
death row did not have access to counsel to challenge their death 
sentences 
the state will now be required to provide representation for 
those men zerkin said although the specifics of the system have 
not been worked out 
sasser who had been told about the decision but had not read 
it said the ruling stems from the case of earl washington who was 
condemned to die in august 1985 washington could not afford to 
hire a lawyer and no volunteers could be found to handle his case 
he was sitting there waiting to be executed and he couldnt do 
anything about it because he didnt have an attorney sasser 
said the importance of this case is that that wont happen 
again unless the supreme court reverses it 
a lawyer was retained about a week before washingtons execution 
date and he won a stay washingtons appeals continue 
joseph giarratano another virginia deathrow inmate who had 
legal counsel was disturbed by the washington case and contested 
the lack of guaranteed counsel to a federal court in 1986 
us district judge robert r merhige jr agreed that such 
representation is constitutionally warranted but that decision was 
overturned last year by the 4th circuit panel 
the latest decision is binding in the 4th circuit comprising 
maryland north carolina south carolina virginia and west 
virginia 
zerkin said the ruling also will serve as a precedent for cases 
in other states but said many i would say most states already 
provide representation without having been required to do so

accused of taking part in a plot to kill president fidel castro 
were allowed friday to leave cuba for the united states the cuban 
government news agency reported 
prensa latina in a dispatch monitored in mexico city said 
ramon guin diaz one of the three political prisoners was 
sentenced in 1966 to a 25year prison term for complicity and 
participation in the attempt on castros life 
it said guin diaz used his high post in the institute of 
agrarian reform to work as a cia agent for three years 
guin who was 32 at that time 1966 confessed his guilt and 
admitted to having worked for the cia since september of 1963 
prensa latina said

information according to the agency

counterrevolutionary prisoners or say how they would travel to 
the united states

an 8yearold boy found wandering in a 
mexican border city possibly survived a plane crash and might be 
from the united states officials said 
the boy who doesnt hear or speak and communicates only by 
gesturing and drawing pictures was found nov 7 by the side of a 
highway in ciudad juarez no one knows his name but juarez welfare 
workers have named him savat 
authorities believe savat is from the united states because of 
his reactions to american cultural icons including hamburgers and 
video games and they believe he lived through a plane crash 
because of his drawings 
he drew a plane then he drew a plane that had crashed said 
luis torre of the texas department of human services torre works 
as liaison between el paso and juarez child welfare agencies 
torre said thursday that the second drawing depicted a lot of 
blood and the bodies of two adults and a child 
we believe those represent his parents and a sister he showed 
me by using his fingers that he crawled away from the wreckage 
said torre 
he said the boy has scars on his chest and back that look to be 
2 to 3 years old 
according to a report torre filed with el paso police the boys 
pictures seem to indicate he was picked up after a plane crash by a 
passerby and taken to a hospital after treatment the boy 
apparently left to look for his family 
authorities are stumped as to when or where the plane might have 
crashed or how savat got to juarez across the border from el paso 
the woman who found the boy guadalupe de la vega of juarez 
said she thinks savat might be from the united states because he 
doesnt like chili tortillas or beans but readily eats hamburgers 
and hot dogs 
he also is good at playing video games which most young mexican 
children lack the money to play 
we just recently got him into a school for the deaf torre 
said they showed him cartoons of american characters such as 
donald duck and mickey mouse and of mexican characters and he was 
more familiar with the american cartoons and seemed to like them 
better 
he added that savat seems more familiar with us money

in response to the states worsening tax 
shortfall gov michael s dukakis top administrative aide imposed 
a cap on the size of the state work force friday and ordered agency 
heads to plan for cuts in staffing 
administration and finance secretary frank keefe said the policy 
is not a hiring freeze because agency heads will be allowed to fill 
positions emptied through attrition as long as they stay within the 
totals authorized as of next monday 
in a memorandum to cabinet secretaries keefe said agencies 
must take action immediately to assure that they will be able to 
reach staffing levels that can be supported by the budget being 
drafted by the legislature 
what we would envision is no layoffs no disruption keefe 
said adding that reductions will be accomplished by not filling 
jobs that become empty 
according to keefe dukakis personally endorsed the plan earlier 
this week after it was discussed at several cabinet meetings he 
also said lt gov evelyn murphy participated in those discussions 
she would become governor if dukakis who is running for the 
democratic nomination for president is elected 
keefe told reporters that the number of jobs he projects will be 
lost through attrition would be in the low thousands across an 
executive branch workforce of about 66500 
in addition keefe said certain key agencies including the 
departments of correction mental health and revenue will be 
allowed some expansion to meet the priority goals of the governor 
and the legislature as a result he said some agencies may face 
relatively harsher cutbacks in order to keep the overall state work 
force at an affordable level 
the budget bureau will monitor personnel rates weekly keefe 
said the situation is fluid and will be reviewed quarterly if 
revenues improve hiring could be expanded he said 
the personnel directive is part of the dukakis administrations 
strategy for dealing with a slowdown in state tax collections that 
has put the spotlight on dukakis ability to manage government 
spending which is one of the prime credentials he has claimed in 
his campaign for the presidential nomination 
as recently as wednesday the official projection of tax 
collections was revised downward by more than 300 million for the 
current fiscal year which ends june 30 
for next year the administrations latest revisions in revenues 
anticipate at least 200 million less than when dukakis submitted 
his original 119 billion budget plan in january

austria and their meeting would cause widespead protests at 
least not like those the last time 
the vatican said that last years audience was granted to the 
presidential office not to waldheim as an individual 
john paul first visited austria in 1983 three years before 
waldheim was elected president 
waldheim has denied allegations that he was involved in nazi war 
crimes while serving as a german army lieutenant in the balkans 
during world war ii 
an international commission of historians appointed by the 
austrian government at the presidents request concluded in 
february that waldheim was aware of nazi atrocities in the region 
and did nothing to prevent them but it left the question of guilt 
open 
waldheim has not visited or received any western heads of state 
since his election in 1986

a former president of the wedtech corp 
testified friday that attorney general edwin meese iii asked him 
about a multimillion dollar navy contract that meese has denied 
helping the defense contractor obtain 
anthony guariglia the former wedtech president testified at 
the racketeering trial of us rep mario biaggi that meese asked 
about the navy pontoon contract at a 1985 ball in washington 
guariglia and other company officials have testified they paid 
800000 to attorney e robert wallach to influence the attorney 
general 
they have said wallach a close friend and former lawyer of 
meeses told them he got meese to intercede on the companys 
behalf for a series of contracts worth 143 million to build 
pontoons or floating portable docks 
guariglia was the first witness to testify about anything meese 
allegedly said about the contract 
guariglia told jurors at the 13weekold trial at federal court 
in manhattan that wallach introduced him wedtech founder john 
mariotta and other officials of the bronxbased company to meese 
and his wife at an ambassadors ball in washington 
mr wallach said to mr meese what a fine job we were doing 
in the south bronx that the company was growing and employment was 
growing said guariglia mr meese asked how we were doing with 
the pontoon contract mr mariotta said fine mr meese asked if we 
were on time with our deliveries and i believe mr mariotta said 
fine and that was the end of the meeting 
meese who has not been charged with any wrongdoing has 
previously denied any involvement in the pontoon contract he has 
admitted intervening with the army on behalf of wedtechs attempts 
to win an engine contract in 1982 while he was presidential 
counselor 
meese attorney nathan lewin said because the attorney general 
was in germany i cant give any direct comment on whether he 
recalls or doesnt recall making that statement 
lewin reached at his washington office added if that 
statement was made by him meese it is consistent with his 
statements concerning his limited involvement or knowledge of 
wedtech matters 
meese was not involved in obtaining the contract for wedtech 
said lewin adding that meese has acknowledged that he had been 
told by wallach that wedtech had obtained a pontoon contract 
wallach is under indictment on federal racketeering charges for 
allegedly taking payoffs from wedtech officials to influence meese 
and other public officials 
biaggi mariotta and five others are accused in the ongoing 
trial of turning wedtech which is now in bankruptcy into a

pleaded guilty to corruption charges to testify at the biaggi trial 
in exchange for leniency

a judge on friday rejected a defense 
request for a mistrial on grounds that a prosecution witness 
testimony was unfair in former gov evan mechams trial on charges 
he concealed a 350000 campaign loan 
judge michael ryan of maricopa county superior court rejected a 
claim by lawyer thomas crowe that the prosecution tried to 
prejudice the jury by presenting testimony that crowe said implied 
wrongdoing in how the mecham campaigns checkbook was handled 
mecham and his brother willard are charged with concealing the 
loan by tempe developer barry wolfson willard mecham was his 
brothers 1986 campaign treasurer 
also on friday former us rep sam steiger was placed on 
probation for four years fined 5480 and ordered to perform 700 
hours of community service work for pressuring a parole board 
member over an administrative matter while working as an aide to 
evan mecham while mecham was governor 
steiger 59 was convicted april 7 of theft by extortion in 
threatening board of pardons and paroles member ron johnson over a 
personnel vote 
in mechams trial thursday state handwriting expert william 
flynn testified there had been a number of whiteouts erasures 
and alterations in the campaign checkbook he did not speculate 
on the reasons for the changes 
crowe contended the revisions were innocent corrections but the 
prosecution implied there was something wrong something 
criminal something improper about them 
the effect on the jury was devastating crowe said 
during the afternoon session jurors were read portions of 
willard mechams january testimony to the state grand jury in 
which he denied wrongdoing when he lumped the 350000 loan into a 
465000 total listed on financial reports as a contribution from 
evan mecham 
the transcript also showed willard mecham said he did not know 
about a letter in which his brother promised wolfson the loan 
would remain confidential until after the loans existence was 
publicly disclosed by the news media 
with the jury not present the prosecution argued for admission 
of testimony by a former mecham finance commitee member who took 
notes during a meeting in fall 1986 that say show evan borrowed 
money and dont show borrowed money 
ryan took the matter under advisement saying he will rule 
before testimony resumes monday 
the firstterm republican governor was removed from office april 
4 when the state senate convicted him of two unrelated impeachment 
counts the senate opted not to consider the count against him 
related to the loan after some members argued that to do so would 
unfairly prejudice his criminal trial 
the defense contends the failure to report the loan was an 
innocent mistake 
prosecutor barnett lotstein said in court friday there was no 
negative implication in flynns testimony about the checkbook he 
said the prosecution was seeking in testimong thursday to show that 
willard mecham was a meticulous bookkeeper who was not prone to 
mistakes 
in denying the mistrial motion ryan said he thought flynns 
testimony was quite innocuous and may prove relevant regarding 
willard mechams bookkeeping practices 
the judge also refused a defense request to admonish the jury 
against taking a negative inference from flynns testimony 
the defense friday also sought the exclusion of testimony about 
a number of statements by willard mecham to the state grand jury 
that indicted the brothers jan 8 ryan granted some of the defense 
requests to exclude such testimony but rejected many others 
ryan also chided attorneys on both sides saying they should 
have cooperated more fully in deciding what grand jury testimony 
would be admitted this is outrageous the judge said after an 
hour of arguments on the issue 
the motions were argued without the jury present and took up 
friday mornings court session 
the mecham brothers sat with their attorneys and declined to 
comment to reporters 
in his opening statement thursday lotstein said the mechams 
purposely broke the law when they failed to include the 350000 
loan from tempe developer barry wolfson in personal and campaign 
financial reports 
mecham faces up to 22 years in prison if convicted on all six 
counts of perjury willful concealment and filing false documents 
willard mecham faces three similar counts and up to 9 years in 
prison if convicted 
the republican governor was removed from office april 4 when the 
state senate convicted him of two unrelated impeachment counts he 
took office in january 1987 
mecham long has contended the 350000 loan was properly 
reported on his dec 5 1986 financial report he said it was 
included in a 465000 lump sum that was listed as a contribution 
from himself 
the prosecution has said however that mecham badly needed the 
money to keep his campaign afloat and that he concealed it because 
wolfson asked him to and because his campaign had a theme of being 
beholden to no one

fine totaling 36000 demoted in rank and ordered discharged with 
a bad conduct record 
the same jury that convicted richardson friday of attempted 
espionage deliberated about 2 hours before issuing its sentence 
concluding a weeklong courtmartial 
im still taking care of business right now my lawyers have 
advised me not to say anything at this time richardson said 
after the sentence was announced 
the verdict and sentence are subject to the review and approval 
of the commander of aberdeen proving ground maj gen george akin 
and automatically will be appealed to the army court of military 
review

stealing government property of the unauthorized sale of 
government property and failure to report an attempt by an 
unauthorized person to obtain classified information he was 
acquitted of a second count of attempted espionage 
he will continue to draw his army salary while the conviction is 
under review said army spokesman r rex brookshire if the 
conviction is upheld richardson will lose all pay and pension 
benefits upon his discharge brookshire said 
richardson was found guilty of selling pages of a military 
manual and electronic circuitry from the m1 tank 
prosecutors had painted richardson as a man who was greedy and 
was willing to sell out his country 
during the sentencing hearing chief prosecutor wellington t 
matthews called richardson a crook with an antisocial 
personality 
defense attorneys said richardson loved his country was 
distraught over the december 1987 murder of his son and troubled 
by problems of alcoholism depression and gambling 
lawyer david heubeck urged the jury to be lenient in its 
sentence noting richardsons combat record in vietnam hell be 
bothered by those memories hell remember that for life hes 
already serving a life sentence for those memories heubeck 
said 
the oakland calif native who served 2 tours of duty in

supervisors and winning a promotion 
richardson who was demoted for repeatedly failing to come to 
work testified that he wanted to do something outstanding to 
regain his lost stripe and salary 
it seemed like everything i tried to do right it got screwed 
up richardson testified thursday i felt that i was under so 
much pressure all the time i felt like i was going to explode from 
the inside out 
i figured that i needed to do something to get everybody off 
my back before the jurors began deliberating col earl pauley 
the military judge instructed them to determine whether richardson 
intended to deliver information that would be used to injure 
the united states or could be used to the advantage of a foreign 
country 
pauley said it did not matter whether the act was completed or 
whether the material was unclassified pauley also said the jury 
must consider whether richardson lacked substantial capacity to 
form those intents 
richardson was accused of calling the soviet embassy in july 
1986 the fbi which obtained a tape of the call then launched a 
lengthy investigation to determine the identity of the caller 
after that probe was completed an undercover fbi agent 
contacted richardson in january and he turned over pages of a 
military manual and electronic circuitry from the m1 tank

a jury cleared a blood bank of liability friday 
for its role in supplying aidsinfected blood to a woman who 
contracted the disease from a transfusion five years ago 
the denver district court jury found united blood services not 
liable for damages on the fourth day of deliberations one day 
after finding one doctor liable and another free of responsibility 
for the womans aids case 
lawyers said the case may be the first in the nation in which a 
jury was asked to decide whether a blood bank could be held 
responsible for supplying contaminated plasma a 1986 case in 
california reached the courtroom but was settled before it went to 
a a jury 
the denver jury found no liability on the part of dr edward g 
merritt a family physician who formerly treated susie quintana for 
aids but it ordered dr donald kearns an expert in infectious 
diseases who first tested mrs quintana for aids and said her test 
was negative to pay 70000 in damages 
the jury said kearns was liable because he failed to stop mrs 
quintana from exposing her husband to the disease 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is spread most often through 
sexual contact or the sharing of needles or syringes shared by drug 
abusers it also can be transmitted through blood or blood products 
infected with the aids virus which damages the bodys immune 
system leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer 
mrs quintana 50 and her husband chris 53 of dolores were 
seeking unspecified damages in their lawsuit but their attorney 
asked for 13 million in damages from the blood bank in closing 
arguments 
an obviously disappointed mrs quintana left the courtroom 
without comment 
steve labensky attorney for the blood bank said his client 
felt what they were doing was reasonably prudent at the time and 
apparently the jurors agreed 
at one point the sixmember jury had indicated in a note to 
judge john w coughlin that it could not reach a decision on the 
blood banks liability coughlin instructed jurors to continue 
debating the question 
last night i went home and cried so said juror theresa 
gonzalez in reference to mrs quintanas illness when i took the 
oath i knew i couldnt let that affect me 
mrs quintana contracted aids from a 1983 blood transfusion at 
southwest memorial hospital in cortez where she was being treated 
for an accidental gunshot wound according to trial testimony 
united blood services facility in albuquerque nm supplied the 
tainted blood court records showed 
during closing arguments in the trial the quintanas attorney 
maureen reidy witt said the blood bank was negligent for failing 
to properly screen donors and test the blood supply 
she said testing routinely used at the time to determine the 
presence of the hepatitisb virus in blood could have been useful 
in eliminating homosexual blood donors who belong to a highrisk 
category for contracting both diseases 
however douglas irish an attorney for the blood bank said 
tests for aids in blood were not available until two years after 
mrs quintanas transfusion 
mrs quintana was healthy from outward appearances at the trial 
but doctors said she is undergoing aidsrelated treatment from a 
physician in tucson ariz

iraqiy drove off an 
iranian warplane that flew 110 miles into iraq and tried to bomb 
president saddam husseins family home north of baghdad a mil forces on 
fridaitary 
command announced 
while maneuvering to evade iraqi ground fire the iranian jet 
dropped all its load of explosives indiscriminately in the 
village of ouja just south of tikrit saddams hometown the 
official iraqi news agency said 
no injuries were reported in the attack at 555 am according 
to the news agency the report monitored in nicosia did not say 
whether saddam was home at the time it was the first time the 
iraqis have reported an ate earlywarning radar planes pending overhauls 
to 
strengthen their wings officials said friday 
according to one navy source 28 of the 98 hawkeyes now in 
service have been grounded until they can receive the overhaul work 
by the grumman corp 
the disclosure that such a large percentage of the 
eyeinthesky surveillance planes are now grounded was made 
friday during congressional testimony by marine lt gen stephen g 
olmstead deputy assistant secretary of defense for drug policy and 
enforcement 
olmstead appeared before a house government operations 
subcommittee to discuss proposals to increase the militarys role 
in the war on drug smuggling in the process he informed the panel 
the navys e2cs were in bad trouble with cracked wing 
problems 
the navy has a major rehabilitation problem the general 
continued saying 34 out of a fleet of 85 were out of service 
im not sure any would be available for a crackdown on 
smuggling we have just reduced the force by a drastic number the 
past year 
the navy declined to discuss the matter late friday but several 
sources who spoke only on condition they not be named acknowledged 
the service was facing a serious problem while adding they could 
not confirm the generals figures 
according to the sources there are 98 hawkeyes now in the us 
inventory instead of the 85 cited by olmstead of that total four 
are assigned to the coast guard and customs service for drug 
interdiction work 
those four planes have not been grounded however so all 28 now 
under flight restriction are assigned to the military the sources 
continued even with the groundings the officials insisted the 
navy has enough of the planes to equip its aircraft carriers when 
they go out on a deployment 
the e2c is a twinengine turboprop that carries a large 
rotating radar dome atop its fuselage hawkeyes recently have 
played critical roles maintaining surveillance and directing combat 
operations in the persian gulf in october 1985 an e2c guided the 
fighters that intercepted a plane carrying the hijackers of the 
italian cruise ship achille lauro 
the navy first disclosed the wing fatigue problem in february 
1987 announcing that seven of the planes had been grounded and 10 
prohibited from operating off aircraft carriers 
the service has stressed from the beginning it did not blame the 
planes prime contractor the grumman corp for the wing fatigue 
problem rather in order to modernize the plane over the years 
more sophisticated and heavier radar and communications equipment 
had to be added the navy explained 
the original a model of the plane for example weighed 
roughly 48000 pounds while the current c model weighs at 
least 52500 pounds 
given the constant poundings of carrier takeoffs and landings 
that extra weight has placed more stress on the hawkeye wings than 
they were originally designed to handle as the planes age most of 
them will have to undergo the wing overhauls the navy says 
larry hamilton a grumman spokesman said the company has 
completed three hawkeye overhauls and now has five planes 
undergoing the work at a facility in st augustine fla 
hamilton said two of the planes assigned to the coast guard and 
customs service had required some wing work this spring but added 
that work involved a different problem and eventually theyll 
have to come back for the overhaul 
according to the navy it costs about 250000 to overhaul a 
single wing and 600000 if a wing has to be replaced

this years 41st cannes film festival may 
have come and gone but its hubbub has been preserved onscreen in 
a film that brings into comic focus the cinemas most frenzied 
annual shindig 
its taken 40 years for the image and notoriety of cannes to 
catch up with itself so you can do a satire about it said walter 
robin producer of starlets a 4 million movie that recently 
completed four days of preliminary shooting at this years cannes 
festival 
the movie which will resume filming in southern europe at the 
end of september stars tony curtis as sidney f berko the founder 
and chairman of a fictional film company known as important 
pictures berko based according to robin on every mogul there 
ever was is sponsoring an international new star of the year 
contest at the annual movie confab in cannes 
john hurt in a rare comic appearance costars as the soviet 
nikita vladimirov a kgb agent and former actor who arrives in 
cannes to accompany miss moscow in berkos talent competition 
irina brook daughter of theater director peter brook plays the 
soviet contestant natasha and pamela stephenson appears as her 
sponsor none other than raisa gorbachev 
its an outandout comedy it would be pointless doing it if 
i didnt think it was funny said hurt who is betterknown for 
his critically acclaimed dramatic portrayals in such films as the 
elephant man midnight express and 1984 he currently 
appears in white mischief with sarah miles and charles dance 
hurts last comic appearance onscreen was in the 1982 flop 
partners however the actor maintains that being funny 
onscreen is serious business 
theres no question that comedy is the most difficult thing 
to play the wiry 48yearold actor said you can get away with 
nearly making someone cry but you cant get away with nearly 
making someone laugh 
before starlets starts shooting again in september hurt 
will have completed two more films scandal with joanne 
whalley which already is in production and before she met me 
with isabelle huppert which begins shooting at the end of august 
the actor said he felt fortunate to be regularly employed 
im one of lifes fortunate people to be doing what i actually 
want to do and to come from a country where ive been encouraged to 
do it he said you cant ask for more than that 
but he said he was personally wary of the hype and glitz of 
cannes 
if you were to take seriously the offers made at cannes youd 
be a very silly person indeed said hurt who first came to the 
riviera town in 1978 when midnight express and the shout 
were shown at the festival 
you get offered three films a day here 
and when is starlets scheduled to have its world premier 
you guessed it cannes in 1989

within an hours drive of the 
johannesburg stock exchange the hub of africas richest economy 
live roughly a million black squatters in shantytowns and backyard 
shacks 
even in their squalor many are under constant threat of 
eviction how to deal with the squatters and with a severe 
nationwide housing shortage for blacks is one of the apartheid 
governments most difficult dilemmas 
in theory the countrys white leaders favor black 
homeownership believing it promotes middleclass values and 
undercuts support for revolutionary change in practice the 
government is providing only a small fraction of the land houses 
and funds needed to resolve the crisis 
the desperate lack of homes for those in the lower income 
groups is like a time bomb the sowetan the largest 
blackoriented daily newspaper said in a recent editorial 
squatting and homelessness are decadesold problems in south 
africa but the situation has worsened since 1986 when the 
government abolished the socalled pass laws that restricted the 
rights of blacks to live in urban areas 
tens of thousands of blacks who previously feared arrest or 
forced removal have set up shacks on the outskirts of the big 
cities where job opportunities are better 
the population of the mofolo squatter camp in soweto 
johannesburgs main black township has mushroomed to an estimated 
40000 since it was established in 1986 sowetos black 
administration charges the squatters rent but provides virtually no 
services 
in soweto and other similar townships black local officials 
often have initiated efforts to evict squatters and demolish their 
homes 
the black sash civil rights group has called for a moratorium on 
squatting arrests and demolitions until alternative sites are 
provided 
these people have nowhere to live said a recent black sash 
report they are not living in these illegal and hopeless 
conditions because they want to 
the government professes concern about the squatters plight 
yet it is toughening antisquatting laws 
constitutional development minister chris heunis says 
legislation is being drafted to increase the maximum penalties for 
illegal squatting to a 5000 fine or five years in jail 
he said provisions would be made to allow for compulsory 
summary evictions of squatters even those who contend that they 
have permission from a landowner 
along with these proposals the government has appointed 
planning experts to identify whiteowned land in the 
johannesburgpretoria area that could be allocated for new black 
townships but this endeavor is complicated by protests from whites 
who do not want large black settlements near their homes 
weilers farm one of the few squatter camps formally recognized 
by the government is due to be eliminated later this year 
following complaints by whites that the presence of blacks has 
boosted crime and depressed property values 
the squatter problem is like measles it spreads all over 
said koos van der merwe who represents the area for the farright 
conservative party in parliament 
weilers farm 25 miles south of johannesburg has grown in two 
years from 2000 to more than 8000 residents they are due to be 
moved in october to a site further from johannesburg 
the government estimates south africas housing backlog at more 
than 700000 units some experts calculate that 5 million blacks 
almost one in every five are without a permanent legal home 
it is estimated that by the year 2000 about 2 million new homes 
will be needed or more than 200000 a year at an annual cost of 
roughly 225 billion 
the private sector has assumed a major role in trying to reduce 
the housing backlog last year the south african housing trust was 
formed with the government providing the rand equivalent of 200 
million on the understanding that business groups would contribute 
twice that amount 
but even if this program is sustained through the end of the 
century it would supply barely onefourth of the funds needed to 
meet black housing demands 
the housing trust seeks to provide homes at a cost of about 
7000 to be purchased with installment payments of 58 a month 
however experts estimate that only 25 percent of south africas 
blacks can make a meaningful contribution toward housing costs 
most squatters and many other blacks earn no more than 100 a 
month 
asked if they could provide homes at less than 2500 a cost 
perhaps within reach for a majority of black families officials of 
the housing trust reported the odds are against us having 
success

a new consumer movement appears to be under way 
that seems capable of doing what an earlier period of consumerism 
failed to accomplish 
evidence of its success is all about us day after day and now 
it is being documented by some hard economic numbers in a sense 
it may be so pervasive as to have gone almost unnoticed 
it contrasts sharply with the earlier consumer movement that 
arising in the 1960s and extending into the 1970s helped improve 
the quality and safety of products improved the work place and 
raised environmental consciousness 
in spite of the good it did however the earlier movement 
suffered a grand failure it did little or nothing to keep prices 
in line and one of americas worst periods of inflation 
overwhelmed buyers during the 1970s 
the current consumer movement is aimed almost entirely at 
prices and it appears to be working buyers are resisting efforts 
of producers and sellers to raise prices relative to the 1970s 
therefore inflation is mild 
the resistance of consumers can be seen in various retail 
markets but none more clearly than in automobiles and apparel 
automobile rebates and discounts originally aimed at giving a 
quick onetime boost to sales have become a continuing feature of 
the car market remove incentives carmakers and dealers have 
found and sales decline 
the biggest recent contributor to inflation was a surge in 
apparel costs but simultaneously apparel retailers have reported 
weakened sales especially for womens clothes suggesting consumer 
resistance will end that threat 
seeking an explanation for the effectiveness of consumer 
resistance today especially since it failed in the 1970s analysts 
at wright investors service have found a distinct economic 
disparity 
during the earlier period they state consumer reponse to 
higher prices was tempered by among other things the inability to 
resist such developments as the oil price increases dictated by 
foreign producers 
in addition consumers often had the ability to offset higher 
prices by means of the thenpopular costofliving adjustments that 
lifted their pay by a similar percentage 
moreover some price increases then were deemed irrelevant to 
consumers healthcare costs rising even faser than they are now 
were sometimes offset by insurance coverage paid fully rather than 
partially by employers 
today consumers appear to be in a position to make difficult 
the price increases that came so easily during the 1970s increases 
are in areas where consumers have options chief of which is that 
of not buying 
thus says wright us business has been reluctant to raise 
prices despite the window of opportunity provided by the dollars 
decline over the past three years 
statistical support for the contention comes from a study of two 
measures of inflation the gross national product implicit price 
deflator and the gnp fixedweight price index 
the implicit price deflator registered an inflation rate of only 
17 percent for the first quarter of 1988 the fixedweight price 
index rose more than twice as fast registering 36 percent 
the significance the fixedweight price index measures only 
price changes but the implicit price deflator measures not just 
price changes but also changes in gnp makeup 
the fastrising index maintains the same weight for items in the 
socalled marketbasket regardless of changes in buying patterns 
the slowermoving index reflects changes in the buying patterns of 
households and businesses 
interpretation reacting to price changes businesses and 
households are switching to lowerprice purchases 
the pattern is established it has existed since the early 
1980s wright says 
in short buyers are more firmly in the drivers seat than 
during the earlier consumer movement they are practicing their 
freemarket right to buy priceattractive goods and reject those 
less attractive 
domestic producers know it and so do exporters into the 
american market in a pricesensitive environment they seem to have 
concluded it is simply good business to watch the price tags just 
as consumers are doing

the king was taken away 11 years ago 
by communist rulers but luang prabang retains much of its royal 
charm nestled among misty mountains and surging rivers a 
stillpeaceful repository of buddhism and the finest in laotian 
culture 
despite peeling plaster and ramshackle eaves the old royal 
capital bypassed by war mass tourism and commercial development 
is one of the last places to find old indochina indeed old asia 
thirteen years after communist revolutionaries marched into 
nevernever land victorious in the indochina war luang 
prabang and many of its 23000 people cling fervently to the lord 
buddha 
at dawn lines of saffronrobed monks pad through the streets 
emerging from the towns 57 peakedroof temples to accept rice and 
curries from the faithful in a centuriesold ritual 
the areas communist party chief vongphet salykeyachongtoua 
says 300 monks and novices are still here fewer than before the 
communist victory but a considerable number even by standards of 
countries where buddhism is actively encouraged 
we consider religion as the traditional habit of the people 
vongphet told visiting western journalists buddhism teaches that 
people should be good to each other same as the party 
but he added that laymen now must seek official permission to 
join the monkhood and once enrobed they should help society and 
the revolution 
luang prabangs exquisite shrines in which communist 
authorities take considerable pride seem to be maintained 
although some are in need of extensive repairs monsoon rains spill 
into the interior of the wat mai monastery through holes in the 
roof murals have been bleached the gilding has faded on some of 
the exquisite exterior reliefs 
next door is the former royal palace now a museum to which the 
general public is allowed only periodic access 
this modest onestory building served as the residence of the 
missing king savang vatthana last of a royal line that goes back 
to the mid14th century when prince fa ngoum carved out an 
extensive and powerful laotian kingdom 
king savang a devout buddhist led a secluded life keeping 
mostly to his palace where courtiers and officials approached him 
on bended knees today his outer rooms and throne hall are mounted 
with displays of royal regalia precious buddha images by the 
hundreds and gifts from world leaders 
on display still is a sliver of moon rock from a 1972 us 
apollo space mission and a pen set from president john f kennedy 
leonid i brezhnev the late soviet leader had sent a shotgun the 
late chairman mao tsetung of china sent teacups on the palace 
grounds water buffalos graze contentedly on the grass 
the king and members of his family were taken from luang prabang 
in 1977 and a number of refugee reports say he died in a communist 
reeducation camp communist officials refuse to say whether he is 
dead or alive and steer conversations about the royal past to 
econonic developments and the future 
luang prabang is officially the countrys poorest province its 
subsistence farmers have been hit by periodic droughts and its once 
rich forests ravaged by migratory hilltribes through slashandburn 
agriculture high up the mekong river a rough twodays road 
journey from the capital of vientiane the town remains isolated 
but communist chief vongphet said laos new economic reforms 
have given incentive to local farmers to produce more while foreign 
donors have provided emergency food aid and longterm assistance 
the united nations has a reforestation project under way american 
mennonites are trying to develop smallscale hydroelectric dams 
cuban volunteers work in the local hospital 
meagerly stocked not long ago the towns main markets now are 
bustling most consumer goods come from neighboring thailand and a 
recent warming of relations with china has sparked crossborder 
barter trade laos offers various jungle products for batteries 
toothpaste and medicines 
enterprising vendors like thongchin chitdalin turn cheap soviet 
material into jeans sewing on a fake label of the american 
jeansmaker levi strauss to attract buyers others fashion empty 
heineken beer cans into wick lamps 
the market women are jovial cracking jokes and exchanging 
gossip 
along the mekong knots of townsfolk passed a recent languid 
afternoon as temple bells sounded in the distance schoolgirls in 
blue sarongs and white blouses pedalled their bikes along shady 
motorfree streets smiling at strangers 
bo pen yang is an old laotian saying still heard in luang 
prabang dont worry take it easy let things flow

the sound of fred astaire singing night 
and day floats through the theater as the house lights dim and 
the play begins 
its an anachronistic but totally appropriate introduction to 
molieres the school for wives a 17thcentury comedy about 
obsessive love a subject cole porters most haunting melody and 
lyrics also celebrate 
director mark lamos and actor gerry bamman perfectly capture 
that obsession in a buoyant yet bittersweet production of the 
school for wives now running at the hartford stage company 
bamman relatively unknown on broadway but who has made his mark 
in regional theaters like hartford and the guthrie in minneapolis 
is a revelation he exudes a selfsatisfaction that is most 
delightful when it is deflated the actor plays arnolphe a smug 
middleclass gentleman who raises his young female ward agnes to 
be what he considers a perfect wife sweet obedient and 
emptyheaded 
lamos has set the school for wives in what looks like late 
19th or early 20th century france he gives it a quaint charm that 
suggests the early films of rene clair particularly his silent 
classic the italian straw hat 
a soft pastel glow envelopes the production theres a circus 
feeling to the evening accentuated by designer john arnones 
storybook french farmhouse the characters some wearing white 
pancake makeup resemble clowns arnolphe looks like a bourgeois 
charlie chaplin complete with that smidgen of a mustache and a 
bowler hat 
bamman expertly negotiates the plays poetry showcased in 
richard wilburs graceful and witty adaptation as well as its 
pratfalls hes an expert vaudevillian a master of the slow burn 
and double take worthy of a jackie gleason or a bert lahr 
for a 300yearold play the school for wives reverberates 
with a modern sensibility about women and their roles in marriage 
and a society dictated by men arnolphe desires an uncomplicated 
wife one he says who will say her prayers spin sew and love 
him and he gets none of it 
arnolphes exasperation grows more desperate and more hilarious 
as his fiancee becomes more confident in herself her 
singlemindedness strengthens after she falls in love with horace a 
handsome young man 
a lovely barbara howard makes the transformation of agnes from 
an innocent into an intelligent questioning woman something to 
savor her declaration of independence from her possessive guardian 
should win cheers from the least militant of feminists 
lamos has surrounded his leading players with a fine assortment 
of character actors as distinct for their physicality as their 
emoting eric swanson is an impassioned jittery neophyte suitor 
don r mcmanus and alice haining as arnolphes exasperating 
servants get a few laughs from some low hijinks and ian trigger is 
deliriously funny as a pintsize notary 
but lamos coaxes something more from this school for wives 
than laughs 
arnolphes defeat is not unexpected but it is surprisingly 
moving considering the laughter that goes before it by the end of 
the play bamman has revealed the hurt as well as the humor in this 
pompous mans loss of a wife as well as his dignity 
and its not only arnolphe who faces a bitter truth when horace 
finally wins agnes he retreats with the rest of the men to the 
side of the stage agnes watches their clubby masculine conclave 
with the realization that her schooling in the battle of the sexes 
is far from over its a brilliant tableau 
this production originally done with the same two leads at the 
la jolla playhouse in california last summer is as memorable as 
the delectable and laughfilled broadway revival that starred brian 
bedford and joan van ark more than 15 years ago 
however lamos has taken the play a step further in his 
school for wives the director shows that an education in love 
can be just as difficult for the teacher as it is for the student

japan soon will surpass the united states as the 
worlds biggest donor of foreign development aid it is both proud 
and wary of its new role 
the strength of the yen helped to propel the country toward 
leadership in the broad category of aid called official development 
assistance oda as it is known does not include military aid and 
japanese officials like to call it pure aid 
the japanese are not yet used to the position of a country 
which is expected to provide and which is providing the 
largest oda said masamichi hanabusa the foreign ministrys top 
aid official 
with that status substantial responsibility will follow 
about 70 percent of japans aid goes to asian countries the 
biggest recipient is china a country that does not receive us 
development aid 
as often was the case with the united states as the leading aid 
donor the japanese government has been criticized at home on 
grounds that through aid it is buttressing dictators or fueling 
corruption at the same time aid recipients have pleaded for more 
grants or complained about loan terms 
until about 10 years ago japans development aid served mostly 
to promote its own exports and assure its supply of raw materials 
juichi inada writes in the current issue of the scholarly 
semiannual japan review of international affairs 
resentment of too much japanese selfinterest led to a change in 
policy inada adds and in 1977 the government announced it would 
triple aid in three years with emphasis on the general promotion 
of peace and prosperity 
by 1985 japans development aid had grown to 38 billion 
trailing only france at 399 billion and the united states at 94 
billion 
late that year the western powers agreed to cut the value of the 
dollar the yen soared more than other currencies and the dollar 
value of japans aid rose 47 percent in 1986 to 56 billion 
second to the united states 98 billion 
when the 1987 disbursement figures are in japans aid will have 
grown to about 74 billion hanabusa said and the budget for the 
japanese fiscal year that started april 1 calls for spending 10 
billion 
since us aid is held down by washingtons budget restraints 
the japanese feel they will overtake the united states in this 
fiscal year the united states spend 88 billion on development 
aid in 1987 
the us government has encouraged japan to expand its 
development aid 
the us deputy defense secretary william howard taft iv told 
the senate defense appropriations subcommittee may 26 that japan 
not only will surpass the united states this year it also can 
afford a further dramatic increase 
measured against the size of the economy japans aid is not 
outstandingly generous this year it will be about 03 percent of 
the gross national product higher than the us rate of 023 
percent but below the average of 036 percent among major western 
donor countries 
japan is expected to announce a further increase in aid at the 
toronto summit of the seven big freemarket democracies june 1921 
more than 40 percent of the increase in japans aid is due to 
the higher value of the yen said hanabusa who is directorgeneral 
of the economic cooperation bureau in the foreign ministry 
he pointed out that the aid outlay also has risen in yen even 
though the overall government budget is frozen this he said 
demonstrates a strong commitment to development aid 
the yens strength has caused trouble for countries that took 
yen loans and now have to repay by earning devalued dollars 
this is not our fault hanabusa said japan has provided new 
loans to such borrowers and reduced interest rates to an average of 
26 percent 
but here it is a bit difficult for us to satisfy those 
borrowers completely he said in an interview 
giving aid can be a vexing responsibility hanabusa added 
citing as an example the philippines where japan is the largest 
single donor to the government of president corazon aquino 
we have doubled our assistance last year but we are a little 
ill at ease he said we are not controlling that country 
which we shouldnt we really dont know that what we do is 
actually taking effect 
some critics in thailand claim japanese aid is intended mostly 
to benefit japanese contructions companies hanabusa denied the 
charge japanese aid helped build a concert hall in thailand 
japanese aid was a major factor in indonesias becoming 
selfsufficient in rice hanabusa said 
hanabusa acknowledged that japan like other countries has an 
element of selfinterest in giving aid 
but he said japanese aid is purer than the others in that we 
have no colonial inclination we have no strategic consideration 
we have no wish to impose our will on others

jews have lived in the south for more than 200 years but their 
history as a subgroup has long been ignored their religious roots 
and desire to fit in alongside their often fundamentalist christian 
neighbors have produced a cultural blending that sets them apart 
from the american jewish establishment 
i am not certain what it means to be both a jew and a 
southerner eli evans wrote in his personal account of growing up 
in durham nc to have inherited the jewish longing for a 
homeland while being raised with the southerners sense of home 
the sunbelt is home for more jews now the jewish population in 
the south has grown to about 11 million in alabama arkansas 
florida georgia kentucky louisiana mississippi north carolina 
south carolina tennessee texas and virginia according to a 1987 
estimate made for the american jewish committee florida has about 
half of the souths jewish population mostly in the southern part 
of the state 
the committee counts about 59 million jews throughout the 
united states 
jews historically were scattered in rural communities across the 
region and their presence remains strongest in mediumsized cities 
and small towns through active congregations like bnai shalom in 
tiny blountville tenn 
i have to come in for a cultural injection now and then 
because i miss it said sharon moskowitz 36 a new york native 
who with her husband and two children travels from marion va to 
blountville most friday nights to attend services at bnai shalom 
they are the only jews in marion a town of about 7000 in 
southwestern virginia near the northeastern tennessee border 
i used to be super super anxious about it ms moskowitz 
said of rearing her 6yearold son and 3yearold daughter in a 
nonjewish town my son goes to camp in long island and he was 
the only one who knew the hebrew songs at the camp in the north 
they live it so they dont have to learn it we cant take it for 
granted 
judy peiser who still lives in her hometown of memphis tenn 
and heads the center for southern folklore there said im 
always explaining the jewish culture its a constant learning 
process for them nonjewish southerners and a teaching process 
for jews youve got to know the answers 
jews first ventured to the south from the northeast or took more 
direct routes to flee unfriendly european and spanish homelands via 
ocean ports in galveston texas charleston sc and other 
southern cities 
the first arrivals were refugees of the fading spanish 
inquisition who dived early into the american melting pot and 
enthusiastically adopted the aristocratic southern culture 
the spanishspeaking jews were followed in the early to 
mid1800s by jews from germany who set out on foot as peddlers 
saved enough money to buy horses then wagons and later opened 
shops they were followed by a huge wave of east european 
immigrants who were more outwardly religious and who disdained the 
assimilationist tendencies of the earlier arrivals 
jews often took prominent places in their new southern 
hometowns and the region today lacks a distinct bluecollar jewish 
class 
jews had to walk a very tight line said abraham peck 
administrative director of the american jewish archives at hebrew 
union college in cincinnati its really an amazing thing that 
they were able to live in two worlds one a world of their own 
religious liberalism and the other a closedoff segregated 
society 
american judaisms most liberal faction reform judaism was 
born in the south where jews were more economically dependent on 
their nonjewish neighbors black and white 
carolyn lipsonwalker whose doctoral dissertation is titled 
shalom yall the folklore and culture of southern jews said 
southern jews have fused their social and religious practices to 
produce a dual culture 
among the examples her research turned up 
a cookbook put together by the women of a synagogue in baton 
rouge la includes a recipe for matzoh ball gumbo 
a synagogue in brookhaven miss for years held a high holy 
day shrimp fry even though traditional jewish dietary laws ban 
shellfish 
a jewish family in texas often barbecued matzoh on their 
backyard grill 
a nashville tenn octogenarian recalled a temple celebration 
marked by the arrival of hanukkah claus on reindeer 
a jewish man from savannah ga explained he never thought of 
marrying outside of his faith asked what he meant ms 
lipsonwalker said he replied well southern jews of course 
ethnic differences were discouraged in the south she remembers 
being chided as a child in tuscaloosa ala for using yiddish 
words but the practice of religion was encouraged ms 
lipsonwalker said 
jews in the south both natives and transplants are affiliated 
with synagogues and other jewish organizations more than jews 
living elsewhere and jews in the south often travel hundreds of 
miles to seek jewish contact for themselves and their children her 
research concluded 
until recently even the conservative and orthodox jews in the 
south were less traditional than their northern jewish 
counterparts ms lipsonwalker wrote what will the goyim 
nonjews think takes on a great significance in the relatively 
homogeneous south 
the south has its notorious examples of violent antisemitism 
including the ku klux klan and the atlanta lynching of leo frank 
for the murder of a 14yearold pencil factory worker in 1913 but 
gail gans a researcher in new york for the antidefamation league 
of bnai brith said the region no longer stands out as a bastion 
of discrimination and hatred against jews 
it has historically of course she said 
evans peck and other researchers agreed the postcivil war 
period was among the worst for antisemitism in the south 
a notable example was the scapegoating of judah p benjamin a 
new orleans lawyer who served as attorney general secretary of war 
and secretary of state under jefferson davis many blamed him for 
the confederacys defeat while others falsely accused him of 
involvement in abraham lincolns assassination evans said 
benjamin fled in disguise to england 
during the 1870s and through the beginning of the 20th 
century antisemitism in the south in all its manifestations 
were the actions of powerless men reaching out to compensate for 
their economic distress peck wrote in a paper on southern jewry 
blacks served as a lightning rod absorbing expressions of bias 
that might otherwise have been directed at jews in the south where 
antisemitism was aimed more against a generalized stereotype of 
the jew said joseph cohen a tennessean who founded the jewish 
studies program at tulane university 
the blacks and the catholics had the worst time of it and they 
were always a buffer he said 
as for southern jews their years of being neighbors and local 
merchants seemed to help defuse potential trouble said cohen 
there was a big difference between the stereotypical jew and sam 
who ran the store

high above hong kongs imposing skyline the 
final girders are swinging into place atop the bank of chinas 
striking prismshaped building 
the 70story glassandsteel building to be the local 
headquarters of mainland chinas official bank is a 
nonetoosubtle symbol of chinas unrivaled influence and growing 
activity in this british colony which reverts to chinese 
sovereignty in 1997 
communist chinas soaring presence is a result of 
marketoriented economic reforms championed by chinese leader deng 
xiaoping in beijing and the part of the agreement with britain that 
says hong kong can keep its capitalist system for 50 years after 
1997 
chinese officials of various ranks are invading hong kong for a 
crash course in capitalism and to secure moneymaking deals the 
big chinese companies are wheeling and dealing in hong kongs 
highflying property market investing in major construction 
projects and even buying large blocks of local stock 
chinese diplomats are busy too 
xu jiatun chinas top diplomat in hong kong shows up at pop 
concerts and cocktail parties he heads the local branch of chinas 
official xinhua news agency but is viewed by many as the colonys 
shadow government 
xus main task is to promote stability and prosperity in hong 
kong and he is full of kind words for its capitalist society 
we have some comrades who always fear capitalism but in fact 
they dont understand that the modern capitalist system is a great 
creation of human civilization he has told reporters 
no official figures are available to show how many chinabacked 
companies are in hong kong but estimates run into the thousands 
china is widely regarded as the largest foreign investor in hong 
kong with estimates ranging from 6 billion to 8 billion 
the investments include department stores factories 
supermarkets and real estate much of the activity is financed by 
the 14member bank of china group which saw profits rise by 30 
percent to 60 percent in 1987 according to the capital information 
services financial research firm 
chinas property purchases in hong kong totaled about 1 billion 
last year exceeded only by japanese and local investors according 
to william kwan of chesterton petty an international property 
consulting company china snatched up hotels office buildings and 
residential highrises 
they have to support the political confidence of people in 
the years before 1997 kwan said noting that the injection of 
chinese capital creates demand and raises real estate prices 
some deals reflect the need for more space by expanding chinese 
companies while other deals are strictly to make money 
china international trust and investment corp for example 
bought an office building near the central business district for 
about 45 million in may 1987 and then sold it to japanese 
interests five months later for a 35 percent profit according to

other chinese moves that have turned heads in hong kong include 
bailouts of financially troubled hong kong banks and a pledge 
by the bank of china of the equivalent in hong kong dollars of 128 
million to save the colonys teetering futures exchange after the 
global stock market crash in october 
the purchase by citic which is chinas premier international 
investment company of 125 percent of cathay pacific airways ltd 
the territorys profitable flag carrier 
participation of three chinese companies in three competing 
consortia bidding for a multimilliondollar tunnel project through 
the suburban new territories 
matching chinas flurry of economic activity in hong kong has 
been its expanded political work 
from the xinhua headquarters across the street from the happy 
valley race track a staff of several hundred stay in touch with 
nearly every sector of society 
hong kongs chineselanguage wide angle magazine reported that 
the news agency has separate departments responsible for keeping in 
touch with the hong kong government students grassroot 
organizations and the colonys elite 
joseph ys cheng a political science lecturer at chinese 
university of hong kong says chinas plan to win over local 
residents is a longtime process of befriending us of coopting 
us so when the chinese come in 1997 theres a very good chance 
of us being immobilized or at least neutralized 
one group that china has successfully cultivated is the power 
elite who believe toeing the beijing line is the best way to keep 
their businesses healthy after 1997 
china also can count on several local organizations to support 
its policies here 
for example the hong kong federation of trade unions which 
represents about 170000 workers mobilized its members last year 
to support chinas opposition to general legislative elections in 
hong kong this year 
this along with the colonial governments decision to delay 
elections until 1991 has led some local activists to believe china 
already is calling the shots in hong kong

a 3yearold effort to combat erosion wearing 
away 3 billion tons of topsoil a year in the farm belt is beginning 
to produce results conservationists and farm lawmakers say 
it is saving a half a billion tons of soil from erosion each 
year says senate agriculture committee chairman patrick leahy 
dvt it has helped the farmer by stabilizing farm income and 
land values it has helped the public by reducing pollution and 
lowering the cost of farm programs 
the conservation reserve program created under wideranging 
1985 farm legislation marked a sharp departure from soil erosion 
programs in the past 
rather than taking the traditional yeartoyear approach it 
envisions longterm idling of huge amounts of highly erodible land 
some 25 million highly erodible farm acres have been placed in 
the conservation reserve thus far the government is paying rent to 
keep the land out of cultivation except for trees and cover crops 
that halt erosion 
the aim is to place 45 million such acres into the reserve by 
1990 
farmers are banned under the program from using land placed in 
reserve for grazing and production of hay or row crops such as 
corn and soybeans that wear away highly erodible soil 
preliminary indications cited by conservationists are that the 
program has reduced erosion by 450 million to 500 million tons of 
soil a year 
the government estimated annual erosion at three billion tons in 
1985 when the program was approved 
were saving 10 times more soil than we were in the previous 
programs says bob gray a policy consultant to the american 
farmland trust a washington group that spearheaded the campaign 
for the reserve 
rental payments are admittedly costly to the government but the 
program has thus far escaped the type of criticism that has been 
focused on some of the crop subsidy provisions of the 1985 law 
one reason may be that the program limits crop production and 
thus is a factor in holding down surpluses that can cause an 
explosion of federal payments under price and income support 
programs as well as storage costs 
moreover there are costs to the farmer in placing the land in 
reserve 
this is not just money coming to the farmer to put in the bank 
or go on a holiday with it says house agriculture committee 
chairman e kika de la garza dtexas there is a cost to 
preserve the land or just to plant a vegetative cover 
rents range from 45 to 50 an acre 
one problem that has cropped up however is that rents have 
been high enough to drive up the going rate for land in some parts 
of the country 
this is a big problem and a big program says 
conservationist ken cook a major architect of the program there 
are going to be some mistakes and misfits but this is a 
gigantic stride away from what we had before 
not everyone views the program with equal enthusiasm rather 
than blasting it however potential critics tend to say it has 
done some good but could benefit from modifications 
pierre crosson a senior fellow with resources for the future a 
washingtonbased nonprofit research group says it is still to 
soon to make really firm judgements as to precisely what the 
payoff of the program is 
we dont know enough about what the various benefits are to be 
very conclusive about that sort of thing he says 
crosson is finishing a report that he says will show the program 
has caused little improvement of water quality because most of the 
land in the reserve contributes little to the sedimentation that 
causes water quality problems 
agricultural runoff has been a major contributor to water 
problems a 1985 report from the conservation foundation estimated 
the offfarm costs of soil erosion at perhaps 61 billion a year 
and possibly even as high as 13 billion 
one oftcited cost is the army corps of engineers dredging of 
reservoirs that have become filled with silt 
agricultural runoff that finds its way down the mississippi to 
the gulf of mexico is also blamed for much of the nagging problem 
of seafood contamination 
still water quality improvement is a secondary objective of the 
program the main goal is cutting back on soil erosion 
from a conservation standpoint the conservation reserve 
program is a distinct improvment over earlier usda land 
conservation programs crosson says that doesnt mean that it 
couldnt be done still better 
some of the most serious erosion problems are focused in the 
high plains region reaching from eastern montana to colorado and 
nebraska and to parts of iowa missouri and kansas 
the problem intensified in the 1970s when agricultural exports 
and farming were expanding dramatically 
were talking about thin and fragile soils that in many cases 
were not meant to be farmed says sierra club lobbyist daniel 
weiss they were plowed out in the 1970s to make a quick buck

the annexation of korea in 1910 the rape of 
nanking in 1937 the surprise attack on pearl harbor in 1941 all 
these are accepted in standard western histories as aggressions of 
japanese militarism in the first half of the 20th century but in 
todays economically powerful japan nationalistic rightwingers 
maintain that was not the way it was here is a report on their 
efforts to revise history 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a move that seeks to justify japans militaristic 
past is gaining ground in conservative governing circles 
in contrast with trends in the soviet union and austria toward 
greater criticism of the records of their pasts under stalinism and 
nazism some japanese conservatives are challenging the generally 
accepted judgment that japan was an aggressor before and during 
world war ii 
rightwing opinions have cropped up repeatedly in high places as 
japans economic prosperity surged in the 1980s raising japanese 
pride and diluting some of the guilt the country felt after its 
defeat in war 
most recently the director general of the national land agency 
seisuke okuno set off an international furor by saying that japan 
was not an aggressor in world war ii and that the country fought 
to protect itself at a time when the white race had turned asia 
into a colony 
the 75yearold okuno who is regarded as the third most 
prominent member of prime minister noboru takeshitas cabinet was 
forced to resign may 19 but not before his viewpoint had been 
backed by 41 parliamentarians of the governing liberal democratic 
party ldp 
we fully support mr okunos remarks and his historical 
interpretation the rightwingers said in a statement 
they have organized themselves within the party which has been 
in power nearly four decades as the fellow thinkers council on 
fundamental national issues headed by shizuka kamei 
there are many other people inside and outside the ldp who 
support our nationalistic move to reevaluate the past and 
traditional values kamei said in an interview they just dont 
openly express their sentiment 
the scope of the movement is hard to judge kameis rightwing 
group had 18 members when it started two years ago and has grown to 
41 but thats still a small minority of the ldps 445 
representatives in the two houses of parliament 
japan does not have broadbased opinion surveys that probe 
nationalistic sentiments or ask whether people believe the country 
was an aggressor five or six decades ago but as pride in the 
countrys economic accomplishments grows commentators see a 
gradual change in the postwar attitudes of great guilt for wartime 
actions 
nationalism now seems to be growing among the japanese who 
are eager to see their country exercise a political voice becoming 
of its economic stature the japan times commented in an 
editorial on okunos remarks 
our belief is that japan must pursue its national interests 
with a righteous historical perspective otherwise it will face 
formidable resistance surely an unwise approach on the part of 
japan 
okuno was the second official forced to leave the cabinet in two 
years for challenging the generally accepted historical record 
education minister masayuki fujio was fired in 1986 by yasuhiro 
nakasone then prime minister after he angered south and north 
korea by writing in a magazine article that korea was partly 
responsible for its annexation by japan in 1910 
the education ministry was the center of controversy in 1980 
after it forced the noted japanese historian saburo ienaga to 
delete from a high school textbook his whole reference to the 
imperial armys notorious 731 unit in china ienaga alleged that 
the unit conducted experiments on about 3000 american chinese and 
soviet prisoners of war and others using typhus cholera and 
bubonic plague germs 
according to yasushi mitarai director of the education 
ministrys textbook administration division the ministry still 
maintains that not enough evidence is available to prove the 
allegation 
in 1981 and 1982 the education ministry asked ienaga and other 
historians to revise and soften the wartime record proposing to 
describe japans invasion of china as an advance not as 
aggression as previous textbooks did to delete mention of the 
rape of nanking in china in 1937 and to describe the forcible 
transfer of koreans to japan as an implementation of the national 
mobilization order to the koreans 
china claims that more than 300000 people mainly civilians 
were killed or raped after nanking then chinas capital fell to 
four japanese divisions in december 1937 the south korean 
government says more than 1 million koreans were dragooned to do 
forced labor in japan during world war ii 
the education ministrys move drew sharp protests from asian 
countries and japan settled a dispute with china and south korea 
by promising to amend controversial passages

president reagan and mikhail s gorbachev may have 
squared off in private during their fourth summit but in public 
everywhere from the ballroom to the bolshoi they looked like a 
pair of superpower pals 
outside the kremlin reagan flung his arm over gorbachevs 
shoulder after one closeddoor meeting at the ballet gorbachev 
pulled his chair closer to reagans so they could share smalltalk 
they left the theater box with their arms at each others waists 
the highlevel chumminess is seen as a dramatic symbol of the 
end of cold war politics but does it have any real impact on 
sovietamerican negotiations 
it would be simplistic to think these two men can ramrod 
through an arms agreement on their own one american official 
close to the talks said privately on the other hand they can 
tell their negotiators to cut through the baloney which sometimes 
can be the death of an accord 
unlike the iciness that divides nancy reagan and raisa 
gorbachev reagan and gorbachev share a rapport that even when 
tempered by wariness apparently helps steer them through 
differences and allows them to keep talking 
reagan indicated friday that he sees the soviet leader as a man 
he can talk to my personal impression of mr gorbachev is that 
he is a serious man seeking serious reform the president said in 
london 
earlier in a warm farewell speech at the kremlins st georges 
hall reagan told the gorbachevs we think of you as friends 
whether or not gorbachev will strike up such a relationship with 
the man who succeeds reagan in january 1989 remains to be seen 
that uncertainty has fueled speculation that a fifth summit might 
be held before reagan leaves office 
the growing cordiality between the two leaders appears to be 
based in part on each mans ability to be casually charming and 
personable 
gorbachev demonstrated his charisma during his news conference 
he interrupted his own statement about sovietamerican relations 
when he noticed an electronic system which provided a simultaneous 
translation of his remarks was not working in one row 
in a remarkable performance for a soviet leader a smiling 
gesturing gorbachev orchestrated a solution asking russian 
speakers to change places with the foreign journalists 
the burgeoning friendship between reagan and gorbachev also 
reflects a deepening understanding of each others countries which 
analysts hail as an important development 
reagan apparently with some surprise told a group of soviet 
students they reminded him of american university students back 
home and although he met with soviet dissidents during his 
fiveday visit reagan has become progressively less preachy about 
human rights issues during his four summits with gorbachev 
there was more and more politics and less rhetoric in this 
summit gorbachev said friday in remarks carried by soviet media 
for his part the general secretary has acknowledged that the 
soviets have much to learn about the americans 
the american administration does not have an understanding of 
the real situation regarding human rights gorbachev said 
wednesday at his unprecedented news conference 
but he quickly added probably we too do not have a clear 
understanding of the american situation in this sphere of life 
this improved familiarity with each others cultures as well as 
the recognition that there is more to learn is probably the 
greatest contribution the reagangorbachev friendship has made to 
superpower relations 
when americans see a president with the hardline political 
views of reagan embracing the soviet leader it is an image that 
carries some weight in political circles as well as in private 
homes the us official said 
all of a sudden it has become all right to be a diehard 
capitalist and still have a communist friend he said and that 
is a change that will outlast reagans term

national product is an important barometer of the economys health

burlington northern inc owner of the nations 
largest railroad has concluded that oil and trains dont mix at 
least not in the same company 
the seattlebased conglomerate announced a major restructuring 
thursday that includes separating nontransportation operations 
into a subsidiary that eventually will be spun off as a separate 
company 
for the time being though burlington northern said it is 
seeking to sell to the public a 13 percent stake in its recently 
formed burlington resources inc and raise around 500 million for 
possible future expansion 
the unit contains burlington northerns energy natural resource 
and real estate operations 
the objective here is to enhance shareholder value by creating 
two very viable companies one in transportation and one in 
resources chairman richard m bressler said at a meeting with 
financial analysts after thursdays announcement 
we think the marketplace has penalized our company because we 
are a conglomerate he said 
trading on wall street appeared to confirm some of those 
concerns burlington northerns stock which rose as much as 412 
by midday thursday closed up 175 a share to 6912 in composite 
trading on the new york stock exchange 
the stock had risen before the announcement on speculation 
burlington northern was planning to sell its natural gas pipeline 
company or other assets 
george morris an analyst with the investment firm prescott ball 
amp turben inc said separating burlington northerns transportation 
operations from the others was a move in the right direction 
theyre two distinctively different businesses the railroad 
and the natural resources morris said when you complicate 
businesses you have a multitude of influences as opposed to a 
purer play it confuses shareholders and distracts from the 
industry 
for example he said when energy prices rise that usually 
hurts the companys transportation unit but boosts the natural 
resource operations 
the company said about 60 percent of its operating income comes 
from transportation operations with the remainder from natural 
resources 
bressler said the companys restructuring was a twostep 
process 
the first objective is to establish a market for the newly 
created burlington resources stock by issuing a minority stake to 
the public then break off the unit into a separate publicly owned 
company 
burlington northern said it filed a registration statement with 
the securities and exchange commission for an initial public 
offering of 20 million shares of common stock it said the 
burlington resources stock is expected to be priced between 25 and 
28 a share putting a value on the offering between 500 million 
and 560 million 
when the offering is completed probably in about a month 
burlington northern said it would retain 130 million shares in 
burlington resources or 87 percent of the subsidiarys stock 
the parent company said it hoped to spin off its stake to 
burlington northerns shareholders by the end of the year or early 
next year the internal revenue service is expected to rule on the 
tax consequences of the move in december 
bressler said the proceeds from the public sale would be used 
for either lowering the companys debt increasing its dividend or 
making acquisitions he said the company is looking at oil and gas 
properties currently up for sale by tenneco inc 
burlington northerns main subsidiary burlington northern 
railroad co has 28000 miles of track stretching from the pacific 
northwest to the gulf of mexico making it the nations largest 
railroad system 
burlington resources includes meridian oil inc an independent 
oil and gas producer and el paso natural gas co owner and 
operator of a 22000mile interstate natural gas transmission 
system 
it also includes plum creek timber co inc a timber and forest 
products company meridien minerals co a coal and minerals 
development and production cpompany and glacier park co which is 
involved in real estate management sale and development

takeover specialist carl c icahn whose 
60pershare bid for texaco inc has met a heavy dose of 
skepticism on wall street says he will have little problem raising 
the necesary cash to finance the buyout 
meeting with securities analysts thursday icahn said he would 
have to borrow 886 billion to complete his offer made last week 
to buy the 862 percent of the companys stock he does not already 
own for 124 billion the bid put a total value on texacos 207 
million shares of 146 billion 
to complete the deal icahn said he would sell two subsidiaries 
texaco canada inc and the companys 50 percent interest in 
caltex among other provisions 
he then would borrow against the 298 billion cash flow 
expected to be generated this year to obtain the remainder icahn 
said 
texaco later scoffed at the plan calling icahns offer still 
illusory and dismissing the details he provided as sketchy 
sloppy and wrong 
icahn texacos largest shareholder launched a proxy fight for 
five of the companys 14 board seats on friday after the board 
rejected his offer 
he said he would have dropped the bid if texaco had put it to a 
shareholder vote at the companys annual meeting later this month 
if his fiveman slate wins icahn said thursday he is confident 
he would be able to persuade the board to sanction such a vote 
as far as financing is concerned weve had several banks tell 
us we would have no trouble raising that on the basis that the 
takeover would be on a friendly basis icahn said 
on hostile terms however it would be just about impossible 
because of certain statutory requirements he added 
texaco said in a statement issued from its white plains ny 
headquarters that icahns 886 billion figure simply wished away 
or ignored more than 5 billion in debt and other obligations he 
would also have to immediately finance 
morgan stanley amp co our financial advisor has informed 
texaco that icahns plan is simply not financable in their 
opinion the statement added 
securities analysts and the stock market have dimissed the offer 
as a ploy either to lure other bidders into the ring or to 
encourage texacos management to buy his shares or help him sell 
them to a third party 
on the new york stock exchange texaco stock has traded just 
above 50 a share far below the 60 icahn proposed in nationwide 
trading thursday it closed at 5062 a share down 175 
icahn acknowledged that his own 60pershare price was 
cheap saying if it were out for a vote theres no doubt in 
my mind it would go higher because there would be an auction 
asked what price he believed would be fair icahn replied im 
not going to go into that 
from the start texaco officials questioned whether icahn could 
arrange financing for the deal despite his pledge to put up 100 
million that would be forfeited to the company if he failed to come 
up with the financing in time for texacos annual meeting june 17 
in tulsa okla 
icahn stipulated however that the 100 million would not be 
forfeited if another party topped his offer or if the internal 
revenue service failed to assent to the plan 
on thursday he said his message to shareholders was simple 
even if you dont like me if you vote for me im going to get 
you 60 and he added if i cant get you your 60 ill 
resign and texaco will get its 100 million 
if his slate loses icahn said he would go away and sell 
his shares in a secondary offer of some such thing 
on another matter icahn also declined to comment on the 
interest in texaco of kohlberg kravis roberts amp co an investment 
banking firm with a long record for conducting takeovers 
in march kohlberg said it bought 49 percent of texacos stock 
and asked permission from the securities and exchange commission to 
up that stake to 15 percent 
icahn told reporters that he had spoken to henry kravis but 
stressed they were not collaborating 
but thats not to say we have any deals with henry kravis and 
we dont we absolutely dont he added 
icahn paid about 12 billion in building his texaco stake 
which is now worth about 18 billion 
the amount he already has paid and the 124 billion he is 
offering for the remaining texaco shares would put his total cost 
for acquiring the company at 136 billion the biggest sum ever 
paid in a corporate buyout 
the biggest deal so far was the 134 billion acquisition of 
gulf corp by standard oil co of california now chevron corp in 
1984

aspirin sales got a shortlived lift earlier 
this year after the release of a study on aspirin and first heart 
attacks figures from a leading market research firm indicate 
industry analysts say that should come as no surprise the 
report attracted a lot of media attention but just how many 
100tablet bottles of the stuff does somebody need if he takes one 
aspirin every other day 
they also note that aspirin makers agreed not to use the results 
of the study to promote their product until the government 
investigates the data further 
analysts say the longterm sales outlook for aspirin should 
brighten however if government studies support new ways to use 
the painkiller 
aspirin sales at the nations larger food stores jumped to about 
190 million tablets in the first week in february up 41 percent 
from unit sales of about 135 million in the same week in 1987 
according to figures from nielsen marketing research based in 
northbroook ill 
but unit sales at those outlets then fell steadily over the next 
several weeks and by midmarch were back to levels roughly matching 
that of a year earlier nielsen said 
from midmarch through the last week in april the most recent 
week for which figures were made available nielsen said unit sales 
ran between 135 million and 140 million tablets a week about the 
same as a year earlier 
the nielsen numbers are for supermarkets with more than 4 
million in sales a year and do not include sales at drug and mass 
merchandise stores 
since 1985 it has been known that aspirin reduces the risk of 
second heart attacks and certain kinds of heart pain and aspirin 
makers have pointed that out in their advertising 
but on jan 28 the new england journal of medicine published a 
study that indicated an aspirin every other day reduced the risk of 
nonfatal first heart attacks by 47 percent in 11000 male 
physicians over a 5year period compared with 11000 who took a 
nonaspirin substitute 
the makers of the aspirin products bayer bufferin and anacin 
each refused to discuss how the news of the study affected either 
their own or segmentwide sales 
travis whitlow promotion manager for nielsen said one 
explanation for the brief sales surge nielsen detected at food 
stores was that some people who heard about the report might have 
bought a bottle of aspirin but would not need another for three to 
six months 
the food and drug administration has persuaded aspirin makers to 
refrain from advertising claims about aspirin and first heart 
attacks until the government analyzes data from the study further 
the agency said today in a commentary appearing in the journal 
of the american medical association that doctors should be cautious 
in prescribing aspirin as a preventer of heart attacks until more 
research supports its value 
it said taking aspirin to prevent heart attacks may increase 
some peoples chances of dying of other things especially 
hemorrhagic strokes 
david saks a pharmaceutical industry analyst who runs saks 
health care investment advisory a consulting firm in river vale 
nj said aspirin makers have spent more time trying to educate 
doctors about the possible uses of aspirin in recent years 
he said he sees signs that the approach is starting to pay off 
and that a halt may be near in the decadeold erosion of aspirins 
share of the analgesic market by nonaspirin products 
there may have been some incremental growth due to the latest 
study but i dont think the average person is paying much 
attention to it saks said 
he said if aspirin makers can make doctors pay attention 
however they could see some sales growth ahead as they recommend 
aspirin for patients

in an attempt to live up to its reputation 
as the worlds largest hazelnut producer and exporter turkey has 
recently established an international union in a joint effort with 
some other exporter and importer countries 
the members of the group include italy spain and west germany 
both importers and exporters and the united states and france 
only importers 
turkey is the leading country in the global hazelnut market 
producing 75 percent of the worlds hazelnut crop and having 70 
percent of the worlds import market ertugrul onen the general 
director of the exports department at the treasury and foreign 
trade undersecretary told the associated press 
but he added that turkey also wanted to play an active role in 
organizing the global hazelnut market 
onen said a powerful importers organization in hamburg west 
germany waren verein had set all the rules in the global hazelnut 
market until now but this has got to be changed he added 
onen said the union would not be a cartellike organization 
that is the reason why we invited importer nations along with the 
producers to be the founding members of the union 
onen said the union aimed at improving the workings of the 
market avoiding unnecessary conflicts preventing delays in 
arbitration cases and protecting the rights of both importers and 
producers 
he added that the union would also seek ways to increase 
hazelnut production and consumption worldwide 
the union is expected to start functioning in a few months 
following a general convention meeting its headquarters will be in 
ankara 
turkeys black sea coast is the source of the countrys hazelnut 
production about two million people make their living from the nut 
crop in the region 
last year the country earned 390 million dollars from sale of 
hazelnuts mostly to west germany france soviet union britain 
austria switzerland italy and the netherlands hazelnuts are 
mostly used in chocolate and other candy 
the production amounted to 260000 tons in 1987 this years 
crop is estimated to be 350000 tons well over the annual average 
amount of 300000 tons 
onen also noted that the crop totally recovered from fallout 
from the chernobyl nuclear accident two years ago 
following the disaster hazelnuts from the eastern part of the 
black sea coastal area showed radiation levels above the european 
economic community limit of 600 becerel a measure of nuclear 
contamination 
the latest measures showed radiation levels under 100 becerel 
for the crop onen said

a planned united nations fund to shore up 
commodity prices is expected next week to come within one vote of 
the minimum needed for ratification a un spokesman said friday 
honduras recently became the 100th nation to ratify the 1980 
agreement on a united nations common fund for commodities and 
approval by the maldives is due next week spokesman graham shanley 
said 
its ratification would mean that countries accounting for 6646 
percent of initial contributions totaling 470 million have 
approved the fund twothirds 6667 percent are needed so one 
more ratification could finally launch the project shanley told a 
news briefing 
hopes were boosted last december when the soviet union ratified 
the agreement reached under auspices of the genevabased un 
conference on trade and development the main forum for the 
northsouth dialogue 
moscow had signed at last july and is due to pay 578 percent of 
the funds starting capital 
the united states which would have to contribute 157 percent 
signed the pact under the carter administration but has not given 
its ratification 
the fund would help finance buffer stocks a device used in 
commodity agreements to help steer world market supplies and 
thereby prices major commodity accords have been negotiated under 
the un conference on trade and development including those for 
cocoa and natural rubber 
an additional 265 million in pledges earmarked for financing 
research and development in commodities will be freed if the fund 
enters force 
the fund was central to an ambitious program launched at a 1976 
conference that aimed to promote price stabiliziation for 18 major 
commodities from bauxite to vegetable oils 
enthusiasm for such accords has since waned among rich 
countries especially after an agreement regulating world tin 
prices went bankrupt three years ago

bank of new yorks hostile takeover bid for 
irving bank corp is being interrupted for 10 days on a federal 
judges orders 
us district judge charles s haight jr barred bank of new 
york thursday from purchasing irving common stock for 10 days 
irving filed suit in federal court last month against bank of 
new york claiming the unfriendly takeover bid violated federal 
securities laws 
under its 11 billion tender offer bank of new york plans to 
run irving as a separate subsidiary regardless of whether it could 
win control of irvings board the offer is for 15 in cash and 
1575 shares of its stock for each of irvings 185 million common 
shares outstanding 
irving claimed bank of new york failed to notify shareholders of 
the financial ramifications of its amended offer and also failed to 
disclose the effects of its proposal to operate irving as a 
subsidiary 
in a 22page opinion issued after the markets closed thursday 
evening us district judge charles s haight jr concluded bank 
of new york must issue and disseminate a supplemental prospectus 
addressing certain issues 
he issued a temporary restraining order that bars purchase of 
irving common stock for 10 days pending additional disclosure 
we have no objection to doing that said john l warden an 
attorney for bank of new york he said the company was compiling 
the necessary information and would have it ready by next tuesday 
and added that most of it is already public 
haight rejected irvings request for additional disclosure but 
directed irving lawyers to draw up another order that would extend 
bank of new yorks offer for six business days after the additional 
information is disclosed to shareholders 
irving has taken steps to prevent bank of new york from 
proceeding with its tender offer last month it amended its 
poison pill so that it would be activated should any unwanted 
investor acquire at least 20 percent of irving shares on the open 
market the poison pill previously would have gone into effect in 
the event of a takeover not supported by management 
poison pill defenses are designed to discourage takeover bids by 
greatly increasing the cost of an acquisition in irvings case 
all existing shareholders except bank of new york would be allowed 
to buy irving shares for halfprice once bank of new york acquired 
20 percent of irving shares 
irving has steadfastly rejected bank of new york takeover 
proposals instead opting for a friendly merger with the staterun 
banca commerciale italiana spa italys second largest bank 
the banca commerciale bid is part of a complex restructuring 
plan that includes sale of irving assets several costcutting 
measures and a special 10 dividend the proposal still needs 
regulatory approval 
bank of new york closed up 375 cents to 3250 in composite 
trading on the new york stock exchange before haights ruling was 
made public while irving rose 625 cents to 64

us and japanese electronics industry groups 
failed to reach agreement this week on increased foreign access to 
the japanese semiconductor market the two sides said friday 
in meetings in tokyo the us semiconductor industry 
association and the electronic industries association of japan 
came close to an agreement on increased access for foreign 
makers of computer chips but talks broke down following 
disagreement over whether concrete targets should be set for 
foreign market share the japanese group said 
before the meetings the third set between the two sides the 
japanese group had presented the us industry group with proposals 
for a joint action program aimed at increasing sales of foreign 
semiconductors in japan 
the proposals included establishment of longterm relationships 
between japanese semiconductor users and foreign makers and 
increased participation by foreign suppliers in the design stage of 
japanese electronic products the japanese group said 
but the us group insisted on a clearly stated target of sales 
promotion for expansion of market shares the japanese group said 
in a statement 
jeanne locke director of communications for the us 
semiconductor industry association said the differences focused on 
how to address the process of market access 
it started to be apparent we and the japanese side were 
talking about two different things she said 
locke said us makers wanted to be able to measure progress 
through actual improvements in market share 
the japanese government has urged japanese firms to increase 
their purchases of foreignmade semiconductor chips but us 
makers say the growth of their sales in the japanese market is too 
slow 
in april 1987 us president ronald reagan imposed 300 million 
in punitive tariffs on japanese electronic products for japans 
alleged violation of a 1986 semiconductor agreement in the pact 
japan pledged to boost foreign access to the japanese market and 
stop alleged sales of semiconductors by japanese producers at 
unfairly low prices a practice called dumping 
a total of 135 million of the trade sanctions have since been 
lifted following a us commerce department report that japanese 
makers had stopped dumping semiconductors on world markets

rate of 54 percent was accompanied by an increase of 173000 in 
the number of people listed by the labor department as officially 
unemployed 
the department said the labor force those either holding jobs 
or actively looking for them shrunk by 363000 to 1227 million 
the figures are based on a monthly survey of the nations 
households 
a separate survey of employer payrolls showed the economy

job growth in business services which has accounted for one in 
eight new jobs over the sixyear economic expansion has slowed in

to open their wallets and industry analysts say the slump could 
continue through much of the summer 
many of the nations largest general retailers reporting their 
may results thursday said sales were only marginally higher or 
down from levels of a year earlier 
high installment debt an aversion to higher prices and boredom 
with current fashions the same factors that have kept consumers

texas oil tycoon nelson bunker hunt insists it 
was unstable world political conditions and inflation that led him 
to buy silver not a plan to corner the world silver market 
in his third day on the witness stand thursday hunt came under 
the scrutiny of plaintiffs attorney mark cymrot but the onetime 
billionaire stubbornly maintained his ground 
hunt and his two younger brothers are being sued for 150 
million by minpeco sa a mineral marketing company owned by the 
government of peru 
the company claims the brothers nelson bunker 62 william 
herbert 59 and lamar 55 conspired unsuccessfully with several 
middle east businessmen to corner the world silver market between 
1970 and 1980 
in two days of questioning by his own lawyer paul curran hunt 
claimed he did not plot purchases of silver bullion and silver 
futures with two other codefendants mahmoud fustok and naji 
nahas during a party at fustoks home in france 
when cymrot noted the coincidence that both nahas and fustok 
increased their purchases of silver futures after meeting with 
hunt he replied i talked about silver with everybody 
hunt has insisted he was very bullish on silver as a hedge 
against inflation and claimed that in 1979 he couldnt walk down a 
street in paris without being questioned about the precious metal 
as an investment 
i never knew anything about fustoks operation said hunt at 
one point at another he claimed i never knew what nahas was 
doing 
fustok a brotherinlaw of the saudi arabian crown prince was 
the only other defendant to attend the trial three others two 
arab sheiks and nahas a lebanese businessman now living in brazil 
have no us holdings and did not challenge minpecos court papers 
the sheiks ali bin mussalem and mohammed alamoudi coowned 
with nelson bunker and william herbert hunt international metals 
investment co imic a bermudabased company which is also a 
defendant in the case 
lawyers for minpeco claim the hunts and their middle eastern 
codefendants were responsible for the sharp rise in silver prices 
from about 9 an ounce to more than 50 an ounce between september 
1979 and january 1980 
six financial institutions accused of participating in the 
alleged conspiracy have settled with minpeco for a total of 646 
million 
minpeco claims the skyrocketing silver prices caused it to lose 
more than 100 million when the world silver market collapsed in 
march 1980 with prices falling back to about 10 an ounce

the nations civilian unemployment rate rose 
to 56 percent in may only its second increase in 20 months as 
518000 fewer americans were at work than in the previous month 
the government said today 
the 02 percentage point increase from a 14yearlow jobless 
rate of 54 percent was accompanied by an increase of 173000 in 
the number of people listed by the labor department as officially 
unemployed 
the department said the labor force those either holding jobs 
or actively looking for them shrunk by 363000 to 1227 million 
the figures are based on a monthly survey of the nations 
households the rate is seasonally adjusted to discount for 
periodic predictable influences on the calculations 
a separate survey of employer payrolls showed the economy 
creating 210000 jobs in may but that was down from an average job 
growth over the last year of 250000 a month 
almost all of the payroll job increase took place in the 
serviceproducing sector said janet l norwood the commissioner 
of labor statistics 
ms norwood told the congressional joint economic committee that 
job growth in business services which has accounted for one in 
eight new jobs over the sixyear economic expansion has slowed to 
an average of 15000 in each of the last three months compared 
with an average monthly gain of 3500040000 in 1987 
manufacturing employment grew by only 16000 in may after a 
45000job gain in april construction employment fell by 16000 
following a rise of 157000 from january through april 
the 02 percentage point drop in aprils jobless rate the 
first since octobers small 01 percentage point rise and a match 
to the 02 percent gain recorded in september 1986 had been 
propelled largely by assembly line hiring as manufacturers tried to 
keep with the surging foreign demand for american products 
ms norwood called mays 16000 new factory jobs no real 
change but she said that both the machinery and metal products 
industries had registered job growth over the month 
the two exportinfluenced industries have paced the gains in 
manufacturing over the last year along with electrical equipment 
printing and publishing chemicals and rubber and plastic 
products 
the rebound in manufacturing has been accompanied by strong 
growth in wholesale trade which added 25000 jobs last month 
over the last year the labor department said such employment 
has climbed by 275000 threefourths of it in durable goods 
distribution 
meanwhile employment in finance insurance and real estate fell 
by 10000 after a 2000job drop in april 
the financial industry which includes banks and brokerages had 
been one of the strongest areas of job growth through much of the 
recovery but has lost a total of 10000 jobs since january 
the biggest area of job growth last month was health services 
with 35000 new jobs a reflection of the fact that the american 
population is gradually aging 
more jobs have been created in this area over the last 
year than in any previous year ms norwood said in that time 
380000 healthcare jobs have been created 
she added our projections suggest that several of the health 
industries will be among the 10 fastestgrowing sources of 
employment during the next decade 
while the household survey on which the jobless rate is based 
showed a seasonally adjusted decline of 518000 people at work the 
unadjusted figures showed an increase of more than 300000 
ms norwood called the unadjusted increase very low by 
historical standards and considerably lower than last mays 13 
million unadjusted job gain 
the unadjusted data for the period of april through july can 
vary significantly 
in past years when may employment growth has been relatively 
week substantial expansions generally occurred in june or july 
she said it would be premature to draw any firm conclusions 
about the direction of civilian employment from this onemonth 
household survey at this time of the year i believe its more 
appropriate to focus on the business survey which shows continued 
although somewhat slower growth 
an alternate rate including the 17 million members of the 
armed services stationed in the united states also rose in may to 
55 percent 
the department gave this breakdown of civilian unemployment 
whites 47 percent up from 46 percent 
blacks 124 up from 122 
hispanics 90 down from 93 
men 55 up from 52 
women 56 unchanged 
teenagers 156 down from 159 
black teenagers 366 up from 355 
the export boom unbridled consumer demand domestically and an 
upward pressure on wages from the tightening job market have 
triggered widespread fears of inflation 
so far however there is little evidence that the declining 
unemployment rate has triggered any significant wagepush inflation 
were lucky in that the latest shift in demand is stimulating 
the rust belt where there was a tremendous labor force that has 
been underemployed said william dunkelberg dean of the business 
school at temple university in philadelphia we can tap that for 
awhile before we start running into inflation problems 
two years ago the consensus among private economists was that 
any jobless rate below 6 percent would trigger an inflationary 
spiral when that figure was reached with only a 2 percent increase 
in consumer prices economists lowered their socalled 
noninflationary full employment rate to 55 percent 
those numbers are again being revised downward with federal 
reserve chairman alan greespan recently telling congress that he 
foresees no inflationary problem from wages until the jobless rate 
approaches 5 percent 
the consensus from a survey of 49 private economists last month 
by blue chip financial forecasts a newsletter edited by analyst 
robert eggert of sedona ariz was that the unemployment rate 
could fall to 49 percent before raising inflation problems

how secure is the nations phone system ask 
your disgruntled local florist 
thousands of mothers across the country didnt get their roses 
or daffodils on mothers day this year because the phone system let 
them down and florists took the heat for it 
our customers thought that we were lying to them said 
jacqui apostolides office manager of manhattans academy floral 
co which belongs to the ftd network 
the real culprit was a fire in a suburban chicago centraloffice 
switching center on may 8 that knocked out service to florists 
transworld delivery association 
the hinsdale ill fire caused one of the most serious us 
telephone outages in years besides ftd it temporarily disabled 
the reservations center for holiday inns and a communications link 
for airtraffic controllers at ohare airport 
the last set of customers with impaired service was scheduled to 
be moved to a new switch sunday at 1201 am cdt but the 
deficiencies revealed by the fire continue to exist throughout the 
nations phone system 
overall the nations phone system is reasonably secure but 
centraloffice switches such as the one in hinsdale are its 
achilles heels according to interviews with phone company 
executives government officials and independent consultants 
in addition deregulation has accelerated competition much as 
in the airline industry and has increased temptations for phone 
companies to cut corners on safety to save money 
while phone company officials say they continue to give top 
priority to security issues the defense department and other 
agencies are stepping up their scrutiny of potential 
vulnerabilities in the wake of the bell system breakup 
all the changes that have been made have left emergency 
preparedness as a poor sister said john c mcdonald chairman of 
a national research council panel that was funded by the defense 
department and other federal agencies to examine the phone systems 
security 
whats lost in this is any element of national welfare said 
mcdonald who is vice president and chief scientist of contel 
corp an atlantabased phone company 
phone disruptions hurt more today because americans depend on 
telecommunications more than ever for such things as department 
store credit checks and automaticteller machines 
high technology contributes to the phone systems safety in some 
cases but detracts from it in others technology made it possible 
for illinois bell to leave the hinsdale central office unstaffed 
and monitor it from springfield 200 miles away but that meant no 
one was around to snuff the fire when it broke out 
the hinsdale fire department could not be notified for more than 
an hour because its own phones were knocked out incredibly 
illinois bell had no quick backup method of reaching the fire 
department 
central offices are achilles heels because there is no easy way 
around them a mediumsized city may have one while large cities 
have several all the calls in the area will go through its 
switches to be sent across town or funneled onto a longdistance 
network 
to protect themselves from failures at the central office big 
companies are increasingly opting for the controversial solution of 
bypassing the local switch and plugging directly into longdistance 
networks 
but bypassing the local phone companies deprives them of 
revenue making it even harder for them to afford the improvements 
that would lessen their vulnerability 
residences and small businesses are forced into dependence on 
the local phone company because they cant afford the satellite 
dishes or fiberoptic cables they would need to get around the 
central office 
somebody like the local dominos pizza theyre out of luck 
said steven glagow manager of strategic business services for 
coopers amp lybrand in houston 
outlying areas have become more vulnerable because phone 
companies are saving money by closing some smaller central offices 
and replacing them with socalled remote switching units 
if a line breaks between the remote switching unit and the 
central office where the switching is actually done the area is 
left without local phone service in the old days the line break 
would have affected only attempts to call outside the local area 
longdistance networks are more secure than the local portion 
because calls can be routed around a place where there is a break 
but that doesnt mean there are no problems with longdistance 
calls in the era of fiber optics when thousands of calls can be 
carried over a single strand of glass a misdirected backhoe can 
cause more damage than ever 
this past week for example telephone service into and out of 
san francisco over the mci communications corp network was 
disrupted for about five hours after a road grader broke a 
fiberoptic cable 
to lessen its exposure to a fiber cut american telephone amp 
telegraph co has two geographically separated fiber cables over 
major routes such as the bostontowashington corridor and between 
the east and west coasts it is laying a third over each route 
rivals are using the same strategy 
atampt is building a separate network whose sole job is to 
establish the paths that longdistance calls will take that 
signaling network makes it easier to route around problem areas 
skeptics say the creation of a signaling network makes things 
more vulnerable because the completion of a call now depends on the 
proper functioning of two networks but atampt defends the 
reliability of the signaling network 
deregulation has splintered the phone industry in ways that 
reduce flexibility in response to a disaster for example phone 
companies are installing many different brands of switches if one 
breaks down it takes longer to get a replacement than if all of 
them came from one source which used to be atampts western 
electric co 
trouble could also result from the fragmentation of the phone 
system into rival public and private networks that dont 
interconnect 
the national communications system a group of federal agencies 
primarily funded by the pentagon is taking early steps to build 
links between the networks so the government can commandeer as much 
transmission capacity as it needs in a national emergency 
more is better when it comes to safety in the phone system 
more switches and more cables in more places and more varied 
methods of transmission atampt for example is supplementing its 
main network with microwave radio transmission in a new digital 
format 
illinois bell defends its attention to the security of its phone 
network although it says it plans to study such issues as why it 
was not able to reach the fire department for more than an hour 
therell be those that say that more can be done but the 
question is who do you have pay for that it really gets to 
the central issue of affordability of telephone service said tim 
bannon an illinois bell spokesman

a computerized work station that lets 
quadriplegics manipulate a mechanical arm and operate a personal 
computer by speaking commands will mean jobs for many paralyzed 
people the manufacturer says 
architecture engineering law and smallparts assembly are 
among the possible jobs quadriplegics could do with the 50000 
command 1 work station said walter weisel chief executive 
officer of prab command inc of kalamzaoo mich 
heres a system that costs less than a mercedes we can 
deliver it in weeks and it puts you back on the payroll weisel 
said 
the system lets a quadriplegic make telephone calls and tap 
computers and data bases around the world record telephone 
messages operate the desktop computer for accounting and other 
purposes and perform a variety of other tasks for home and 
workplace the company says 
it was introduced thursday with a demonstration by rick walsh of 
seattle a 50yearold quadriplegic who was paralyzed 11 years ago 
and calls himself a computer illiterate 
speaking into a headset walsh said keyboard robot get 
lotus keyboard 
at his side a tan mechanical arm like those that hold up the 
lamp in a dentists office whirred quietly and fetched a book from 
a shelf presenting it to him 
stick lotus keyboard walsh said the arm put the book 
back walsh said he had about three hours of training before the 
demonstration 
similar systems have been developed in university laboratories 
said kg engelhardt director of the health and human services 
robotics laboratory at carnegiemellon university in pittsburgh 
but she said she knew of no other such system now on the market 
turning the research into a product is a very very important 
step and a difficult one she said in a telephone interview 
im really very pleased that its happening 
to use the system a quadriplegic must be able to see well 
enough to read and to pronounce words or make consistent utterances 
in place of ordinary words weisel said 
he estimated that perhaps half the nations quadriplegics 
people paralyzed in all four limbs could use it 
some 140000 americans are quadriplegics because of spinal cord 
injury said thomas stripling associate director for health 
studies and analysis at the paralyzed veterans of america the 
total may be about 600000 if one adds people with quadriplegia 
from other conditions such as cerebral palsy multiple sclerosis 
and severe arthritis he said in a telephone interview 
the heart of the new system is the computer which learns the 
sound of each word or utterance and associates it with a command 
weisel said 
once it learns the sound of one persons words it will not 
respond to the same words spoken by another person which 
introduces a measure of security weisel said 
the full system requires 148 words to operate said greg bodnar 
of prab 
one large corporation is thinking about buying 200 or 300 
systems to use in telephone marketing weisel said 
by the end of the year the company hopes to sell 40 systems 
around the country chiefly to rehabilitation and educational 
centers so that training can begin weisel said a person can be 
well trained in three or four days he said 
more general sales will begin next year he said

bic corp has been ordered to release 
hundreds of internal documents on its disposable lighter including 
results of safety tests performed by the company and complaints by 
users of the lighter 
us district judge e mac troutman on thursday told the company 
to release the documents to attorneys representing the estate of 
ethel l smith a schuylkill county woman who died in 1985 
allegedly after a bic butane lighter exploded in her hands the 
estate is suing bic which is based in milford conn for 11 
million 
other cases of exploding lighters are pending in other courts 
and attorneys said the smith case could have an impact on them 
troutmans 25page memorandum and order affirms a decision by a 
federal magistrate in 1987 that required bic to turn over the 
documents in addition the magistrates order also affirmed 
thursday by troutman did not grant a protective order barring 
smiths attorneys from distributing the documents to anyone else 
including attorneys representing other plaintiffs suing bic 
its very very significant said john w andrews a tampa 
fla lawyer heading a bic litigation group for the american trial 
lawyers association the more information thats public the 
easier it will be to get it before a jury to have this 
information available for plaintiffs is going to save them a 
tremendous amount of money and time and as soon as this 
information gets out the public will know whats going on there 
michael b oropollo a new brunswick nj lawyer who 
represents bic in the smith suit and other cases would not comment 
on troutmans decision and declined to say whether the company will 
appeal 
ethel smith 66 died on july 15 1985 two days after the 
lighter she was using exploded causing her to sustain severe 
second and thirddegree burns over a great portion of her body 
according to the suit filed on behalf of her estate by her husband 
francis 
the philadelphia inquirer reported last year that there had been 
at least 10 deaths and hundreds of injuries associated with the bic 
lighter since 1979 andrews said he is handling more than 15 cases 
against bic including five in which the users died allegedly from 
injuries resulting when the lighters exploded 
according to a statement from bic the company has sold more 
than two billion lighters since it began selling them in the united 
states in 1973 under troutmans orders bic must release all 
information about complaints and accidents dating to 1977 when the 
current bic mod ii design was first sold in addition the company 
must release all design information and test results regarding the 
lighter 
we find bic usas arguments that it would suffer significant 
embarrassment and harm as a result of public disclosure of other 
incidents involving the bic mod ii lighter particularly 
disingenuous given the extensive and detailed adverse publicity it 
claims to have already received troutman wrote in his opinion 
bic has 30 days to comply with the order

the european economic communitys trade 
deficit with japan last year rose by 13 percent in dollar terms but 
shrank 4 percent in terms of european currency units the eec 
commission said friday 
the weakening value of the dollar against european currencies 
accounted for the discrepancy 
the eecs trade deficit with japan rose to 242 billion in 1987 
from 214 billion the year before but in terms of european 
currency units or ecus the gap narrowed to 209 billion ecus from 
218 billion ecus 
eec exports to japan rose 19 percent in 1987 to 1362 billion 
ecus while japans exports to the eec rose by a smaller 6 percent 
to 345 billion ecus 
the eecs trade gap of 242 billion compares with a trade 
deficit of almost 60 billion which the united states registered 
with japan last year 
a commission spokeswoman said the rise in ec exports to japan 
last year showed relations were improving slightly but said much 
remained to be done by japan to open up its market to eec goods

takeover specialist carl c icahn whose 
60pershare bid for texaco inc has met a heavy dose of 
skepticism on wall street says he will have little problem raising 
the necesary cash to finance the buyout 
meeting with securities analysts thursday icahn said he would 
have to borrow 886 billion to complete his offer made last week 
to buy the 862 percent of the companys stock he does not already 
own for 124 billion the bid put a total value on texacos 207 
million shares of 146 billion 
to complete the deal icahn said he would sell two subsidiaries 
texaco canada inc and the companys 50 percent interest in 
caltex among other provisions 
he then would borrow against the 298 billion cash flow 
expected to be generated this year to obtain the remainder icahn 
said 
texaco later scoffed at the plan calling icahns offer still 
illusory and dismissing the details he provided as sketchy 
sloppy and wrong 
icahn texacos largest shareholder launched a proxy fight for 
five of the companys 14 board seats on friday after the board 
rejected his offer 
he said he would have dropped the bid if texaco had put it to a 
shareholder vote at the companys annual meeting later this month 
if his fiveman slate wins icahn said thursday he is confident 
he would be able to persuade the board to sanction such a vote 
as far as financing is concerned weve had several banks tell 
us we would have no trouble raising that on the basis that the 
takeover would be on a friendly basis icahn said 
on hostile terms however it would be just about impossible 
because of certain statutory requirements he added 
texaco said in a statement issued from its white plains ny 
headquarters that icahns 886 billion figure simply wished away 
or ignored more than 5 billion in debt and other obligations he 
would also have to immediately finance 
morgan stanley amp co our financial advisor has informed 
texaco that icahns plan is simply not financable in their 
opinion the statement added 
securities analysts and the stock market have dimissed the offer 
as a ploy either to lure other bidders into the ring or to 
encourage texacos management to buy his shares or help him sell 
them to a third party 
on the new york stock exchange texaco stock has traded just 
above 50 a share far below the 60 icahn proposed in 
latemorning trading on the new york stock exchange today it stood 
at 5037 a share down 25 cents 
icahn acknowledged that his own 60pershare price was 
cheap saying if it were out for a vote theres no doubt in 
my mind it would go higher because there would be an auction 
asked what price he believed would be fair icahn replied im 
not going to go into that 
from the start texaco officials questioned whether icahn could 
arrange financing for the deal despite his pledge to put up 100 
million that would be forfeited to the company if he failed to come 
up with the financing in time for texacos annual meeting june 17 
in tulsa okla 
icahn stipulated however that the 100 million would not be 
forfeited if another party topped his offer or if the internal 
revenue service failed to assent to the plan 
on thursday he said his message to shareholders was simple 
even if you dont like me if you vote for me im going to get 
you 60 and he added if i cant get you your 60 ill 
resign and texaco will get its 100 million 
if his slate loses icahn said he would go away and sell 
his shares in a secondary offer of some such thing 
on another matter icahn also declined to comment on the 
interest in texaco of kohlberg kravis roberts amp co an investment 
banking firm with a long record for conducting takeovers 
in march kohlberg said it bought 49 percent of texacos stock 
and asked permission from the securities and exchange commission to 
up that stake to 15 percent 
icahn told reporters that he had spoken to henry kravis but 
stressed they were not collaborating 
but thats not to say we have any deals with henry kravis and 
we dont we absolutely dont he added 
icahn paid about 12 billion in building his texaco stake 
which is now worth about 18 billion 
the amount he already has paid and the 124 billion he is 
offering for the remaining texaco shares would put his total cost 
for acquiring the company at 136 billion the biggest sum ever 
paid in a corporate buyout 
the biggest deal so far was the 134 billion acquisition of 
gulf corp by standard oil co of california now chevron corp in 
1984

union carbide corp announced friday it 
would withhold 192 million in interim relief to victims of the 
bhopal gas leak while it appeals the order to the supreme court of 
india 
the indian state high court ordered carbide to pay the interim 
compensation april 4 
the needs of the victims will be fully addressed only in the 
context of a final resolution of all issues carbide said in a 
statement the questions of liability and damages must be decided 
through fair means not through retroactively reinventing the 
law 
the company accused the indian goverment of delaying final 
resolution of lawsuits stemming from the december 1984 gas leak at 
a carbide plant in bhopal india by first trying to sue carbide in 
us courts and then by subsequently circumventing existing laws 
in india 
unlawful court orders generate lawful appeals to higher 
courts the company said denying justice to union carbide 
corp ultimately does not help the bhopal victims 
the indian government says at least 2660 peple were killed and 
40000 injured when methyl isocyanate leaked from a pesticide plant 
owned by a union carbide subsidiary on dec 3 1984 in the worlds 
worst industrial disaster 
carbide contends the leak was the result of sabotage

grain and soybean futures opened sharply higher 
today on the chicago board of trade amid continuing weatherdriven 
speculation 
soybean meal opened up its daily 10aton limit and that lent 
strong support to soybean corn and oat futures which also were up 
the limit within minutes of the opening 
some analysts linked the runup in soybean meal futures to rumors 
of heavy soviet buying of south american meal but cathy leow an 
analyst in new york with thomson mckinnon securities inc said 
traders were merely using such talk as an excuse to advance the 
dryweather rally 
with no rains in the forecast nobody wants to be caught 
short so youve got a lot of people wanting to buy and no one 
wanting to sell she said 
only scattered rains were predicted for the grain belt during 
the weekend and longerrange forecasts called for another week of 
unseasonably warm dry weather 
in early trading wheat was 7 cents to 8 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in july at 358 a bushel corn was 7 cents 
to 7 cents higher with july at 232 a bushel oats were 9 cents 
to 10 cents higher with july at 196 a bushel soybeans were 9 
cents to 26 cents higher with july at 845 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on 
the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 15 cent lower to 13 cent higher with june at 
7257 cents a pound feeder cattle were 20 cent to 50 cent lower 
with august at 7610 cents a pound hogs were 90 cent lower to 05 
cent higher with june at 5295 cents a pound frozen pork bellies 
were 53 cent to 70 cent lower with july at 5635 cents a pound 
cattle futures advanced on thursday while pork futures settled

hitachi ltd said friday it managed its first gains in profits 
and sales in three years in fiscal 1987 as profit jumped 39 percent 
and revenue climbed 3 percent 
hitachi the giant japanese manufacturer of electronics and 
electrical equipment said its profit rose to 1368 billion yen or 
109 billion in the fiscal year ended march 31 from 987 billion 
yen a year earlier 
revenue rose to 498 trillion yen or 398 billion from 485 
trillion yen a year earlier 
the increases left hitachi still short of its peak year of 
fiscal 1984 when revenue surpassed 5 trillion yen and profit was 
more than 210 billion yen 
hitachi attributed the gains to a continued advance in its 
computer business a recovery in semiconductors and gains from the 
upswing in japans domestic demand it said those offset a mediocre 
showing by its heavy electrical equipment and consumer products 
sectors 
the results which include the consolidated results of its 
overseas subsidiaries were converted into dollars at a rate of 125 
yen to the dollar

the broadest measure of japans trade surplus 
shrank 127 percent in april from its level of a year earlier as 
imports climbed 30 percent to record levels according to 
government figures released friday 
the current account which covers trade in merchandise as well 
as services and investment income posted a 712 billion surplus 
down from 815 billion surplus a year earlier and an 812 billion 
surplus in march the finance ministry said 
japans surplus also declined in the narrower measure of 
merchandise trade alone falling 45 percent to 849 billion from 
889 billion a year earlier and 924 billion in march 
the strength of the japanese yen and a governmentpromoted 
economic expansion are encouraging strong growth in imports the 
trade gap is shrinking because imports are rising even faster than 
japans rapidly expanding exports 
imports measured when contracts were settled climbed to a 
record 135 billion in april from 104 billion a year earlier 
they were up 2 percent from 132 billion in march 
exports also gauged at the time of customs clearance grew 141 
percent to 219 billion from 192 billion in the yearearlier 
month they fell 22 percent from 224 billion in march 
the trade pattern is encouraging for the japanese government 
which has been trying to restore balance to international trade in 
a coordinated effort with such other industrial countries as the 
united states west germany and britain 
imports of manufactured goods have been rising especially fast 
they noted accounting for 499 percent of the total imports in 
april the largest in japans recent history in march 
manufactured goods held a 477 percent import share 
officials also pointed out that a growing number of japanese 
companies are stepping up imports of products they have made at the 
plants that have been established overseas in an attempt to cushion 
the impact of the yens strength 
the export growth was supported by considerable overseas demand 
for products like business machines and computers according to 
officials aprils exports were the third largest on record 
after seasonal factors were taken into account the april 
current account registered a surplus of 637 billion down 126 
percent from 728 billion in the previous month 
the seasonally adjusted trade balance was in the black by 774 
billion dlrs dwindling from 840 billion in march seasonally 
adjusted imports increased 37 percent to 129 billion from 124 
billion but exports dipped 1 percent to 206 billion from 208 
billion

the favorable results of federal investigations 
into eastern airlines safety and management should boost the 
struggling carriers business although many travelers may still 
hesitate to book flights analysts and travel agents say 
the federal aviation administration said thursday its 
planebyplane inspections showed no serious problems and the 
department of transportation concluded after an unprecedented 
probe that houstonbased texas air corp was capable and willing 
to run eastern and its other key carrier continental airlines 
the results should probably help them eastern they passed 
the test john pincavage airline analyst for painewebber inc 
said 
anthony hatch analyst for argus research in new york said the 
reports help restore their reputation and begin the healing now 
that the worst of the wound is over the worst of the hemorrhaging 
is over 
but even more important than the governments report would be 
news reports of ontime courteous service he said 
eastern lost 181 million last year and its management has 
reported more losses and declines in passengers this year it has 
complained about campaigns led by eastern unions charging that 
management was creating unsafe conditions 
pincavage said some resistance to flying eastern is likely to 
remain because of its lackluster service 
bill cooper owner of adventure travels in pompano beach said 
client surveys have shown travelers have been more satisfied with 
eastern service in recent weeks but only time will tell he said 
if those who switched airlines and signed up with another 
frequentflier program will be willing to go back to eastern 
norman koppen owner of viking travel in coral gables said i 
think the problems are deeper than safety 
just the fact that theres ongoing internal strife within the 
company gives people cause for apprehension he said 
business travelers in particular have a very long memory 
about service problems said koppen a former manager at eastern 
i think the fact that they got a clean bill of health is going 
to have a nominal effect on restoring peoples confidence he 
said 
the department of transportation probe found no basis for 
serious concern about management competence said transportation 
secretary james burnley 
after their sixweek scrutiny of owner texas air corps 
fitness the investigators also decided that neither eastern nor 
continental is in any immediate danger of financial failure 
the 30day ramp inspections of eastern and continental by the 
faa proved an unsafe condition does not currently exist among the 
carriers faa administrator t allan mcartor said 
when the government investigation was launched in april airline 
analysts called it a victory for union lobbying in an electionyear 
congress 
machinists president charles bryan charged that texas air 
lobbying had influenced investigation findings 
he called the final report an absolute clear whitewash and 
said texas air chairman frank lorenzo has proved hes the darling 
of the faa and the dot 
lorenzo at a washington news conference thursday hailed the 
federal report as showing eastern and continental are absolutely 
safe and absolutely fit those airlines passed inspection with 
flying colors 
eastern spokesman robin matell called the investigation 
comprehensive and thorough and said that any charge to the 
contrary by a union leader is simply more of the same distorted 
rhetoric weve been hearing for years the findings vindicate 
easterns operations and maintenance practices no amount of 
soapbox grandstanding can change those findings 
eastern and the machinists are in federal mediation and the 
pilots unions contracts is opened to be amended july 1 eastern 
wants to cut labor costs by 450 million or nearly 30 percent

a pair of big building contractors from japan 
and the united states announced friday they had formed an 
association to explore possible joint ventures but the american 
partner said it does not expect to win much construction work in 
japan 
the linkage was announced by new yorkbased turner corp the 
biggest us general contractor for buildings and kumagai gumi co 
ltd one of japans big six contractors 
currently we have none business in japan nor do we expect 
to have any major operations there it allows us to have a very 
small start if you will in japan said hal parmelee president 
of turner construction co turners us subsidiary 
parmelee confirmed the linkage was prompted by a diplomatic 
agreement reached last month that would open the japanese 
construction market wider to us contractors he said it could 
also help turner get work from japanese clients in the united 
states although both companies will continue to do some 
independent work 
in a more extensive deal parsons corp a pasadena 
califbased engineering firm last month announced agreements with 
japans shimizu corp to pursue projects together in japan and to 
form a jointly owned japanese company 
turner and kumagai gumi have already worked together on three 
joint construction ventures in manhattan with a total value of 215 
million americas towers john jay college of criminal justice and 
hospital for special surgery 
japans kansai international airport project a subject of 
intense negotiation between the united states and japan is one 
that turner and kumagai gumi said they have strong interest in 
and will initially pursue 
kumagai gumi is about twice the size of turner it ranked 
seventh in the world among general contractors in 1986 while 
turner ranked 193rd according to enr mcgrawhill incs weekly

financier carl c icahns multibilliondollar 
bid for texaco inc gained no ground friday as wall street remained 
unmoved by his latest attempt to drum up support from investors 
in a meeting with more than 300 oil industry and investment 
specialists late thursday icahn texacos largest shareholder 
gave the first details of how he would finance the proposed 
acquisition and said he was certain he would have no trouble 
getting the money 
but the oil giants stock stayed around the 50 level friday 
or 10 below icahns offer where it had hovered since the bid was 
announced it slipped 50 cents a share to close at 50 on the new 
york stock exchange 
that basically tells you that probably not a huge number of 
minds were changed by icahns presentation said sanford 
margoshes who studies oil companies for the shearson lehman hutton 
inc securities firm 
icahn is seeking to buy the 862 percent of texacos stock he 
does not already own for 124 billion his proposal puts the 
companys total value at 146 billion 
he told the analysts he would need 886 billion in loans to 
finance the deal he said he would sell two subsidiaries texaco 
canada inc and the companys 50 percent interest in caltex then 
borrow against an anticipated 298 billion in 1988 cash flow to 
cover the financing 
some analysts said they agreed with icahns assertion that the 
deal was eminently doable many others were not so sure 
texaco also scoffed at the plan saying it was still 
illusory and dismissing the details he provided as sketchy 
sloppy and wrong 
texacos board refused last week to let shareholders vote on the 
takeover offer at the companys annual meeting june 17 
on thursday icahn admitted he would first have to win his proxy 
fight for five seats on texacos 14member board before he would 
have a chance of getting the offer before texacos shareholders 
he said several banks had told him if the proposal were then 
accepted he would have no trouble raising the necessary cash 
to complete the deal 
once elected icahn argued he and his associates would have no 
problem pursuading the board to field the proposal for a vote 
simply because the mandate their election would be irresistable 
some analysts disagreed 
the record of proxy contests is so irrational said philip 
l dodge of nomura securities international inc management 
almost always wins and as a rule the price of the stock goes 
down 
even if icahn won dodge continued he still would only have 
five of 14 members which could lead to a long internal fight 
and there is no mandate a management cant ignore dodge 
said 
icahn won something of a victory in a related development 
friday when a federal judge in white plains ny rejected 
texacos request that he void icahns directors slate before the 
annual meeting 
but us district judge gerard goettel left open the possibility 
that he might still overturn the election should icahns slate win 
and texaco prevail in a suit charging icahn with alleged violations 
of federal securities laws 
several analysts said that no matter how the proxy fight comes 
out the market still doubted icahns explanation of how he would 
come up with the money to pay for the texaco takeover 
the disappointment was that theres no firm financing in 
place said rosario ilacqua of nikko securities co 
international inc 
ilacqua said icahn would have to put up hefty fees to line up 
the money fees he might not want to pay in advance 
it all boils down to the proxy fight if he loses hes not 
going to need the money ilacqua said 
oppenheimer amp cos paul ting also said there was a lot of 
skepticism about icahns financing ability 
in particular ting said he believed icahn had sharply 
underestimated the money texaco would have to pay for future 
exploration and production costs 
if youre a bank youre going to lend money to mr icahn only 
if you feel comfortable about getting it back so banks are going 
to look at that more than anything else he said 
other analysts suggested icahns figures did not include 
adequate provisions covering payments of the companys debt 
texaco said icahns 886 billion figure simply wished away or 
ignored more than 5 billion in debt and other obligations he would 
also have to immediately finance 
morgan stanley amp co our financial adviser has informed 
texaco that icahns plan is simply not financeable in their 
opinion the statement added

electronic data systems corp on friday criticized 
its founder h ross perot for luring eight executives away just 
one day after a moratorium against such recruiting expired 
were just disappointed he did it said bill wright a 
spokesman for eds which is now a subsidiary of general motors corp 
on thursday perot announced the formation of a new company 
perot systems corp which included three eds corporate officers 
and five of the companys divisional managers their experience 
ranges from 11 years to 20 years 
the announcement caused a sharp drop in the price of gms class 
e stock the dividend of which is tied to the performance of eds 
wright said the defections would not hurt the company which has 
48000 employees in all 50 states and 29 countries he said 
investors should not fear a talent drain from eds to perot 
however he added we will take measures to protect our 
people we want to make sure our employees know what their 
opportunities are 
the move by perot was another twist in a tumultuous relationship 
with general motors which bought eds in 1984 for 25 billion 
after the automaker bought the computer services company perot 
and gm executives began feuding gm finally paid perot 700 million 
in 1986 to leave eds which he had founded in 1962 
as part of the agreement with gm perot was barred from hiring 
any eds employees for two years a period that expired wednesday 
a day later perot revealed he had formed the new company and 
said its first job would be to conduct a threemonth 500000 
study on how to cut costs in the us postal service 
perot said the timing of his announcement had nothing to do with 
the expiration of his agreement with gm he said the postal service 
was eager to get the job started 
the 57yearold billionaire also denied friday that revenge 
played a part in luring the eight executives away 
absolutely not the whole purpose was to build a company that 
could work on a large complex job perot said 
he also said the new company did not pose a threat to eds which 
he said has tremendous talent 
immediately after perots announcement thursday gms class e 
stock dropped 275 a share on the new york stock exchange the 
stock edged back up 50 cents friday to close at 4037 
perot said he took no delight from the drop thats just wall 
street being wall street its an emotional reaction based on 
nothing he said 
the settlement between perot and gm also prohibited him from 
launching a new forprofit business that would compete with eds 
prior to dec 1 1989 the postal contract is a noprofit agreement 
until the expiration date when it will be eligible for a share of 
any savings that result from the studies

farmers insurance group inc and batus inc 
both claimed to have won the hearts of farmers shareholders friday 
after the release of a preliminary count of a vote on batus 45 
billion hostile takeover bid for farmers 
batus a kentuckybased tobacco and retailing conglomerate 
claimed the vote went 51 percent in favor of a resolution calling 
on farmers management to negotiate with batus 
but farmers maintained batus got only 40 percent of the vote 
farmers version of the count included abstentions said 
spokesman tom welch farmers bylaws require a resolution to win the 
support of a majority of those shares eligible to vote rather than 
a majority of those actually casting votes he said 
the preliminary tally compiled by independent counter copeople from 
hargeisa to the 
nearby town of garowe before the operation stopped because of a 
curfew said the british high commission in mogadishu the somali 
capital 
the airlift coordinated by the un development program was to 
resume saturday 
there are 25 britons and about 20 americans among the 160 
foreigners said diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity they 
did not have a breakdown on the other nationalities most of the 
foreigners are aid workers 
the somali national movement engaged in a 7yearold struggle 
to overthrow the government of maj gen mohamed siad barre 
claimed it took hargeisa on tuesday and the main port of berbera a 
day later 
diplomats in mogadishu said there was light fighting but that 
hargeisa was in government hands 
berbera is peaceful but tense british diplomats in 
mogadishu said in a telex message there are no immediate plans 
for evacuation 
the government has not commented on the fighting 
rebel officials reached by telephone in london and in addis 
ababa the ethiopian capital claimed their forces controlled 
hargeisa and were battling soldiers holed up in barracks near the 
airport six miles outside the town 
ahmed mohamed silanyo chairman of the rebel movement said in a 
telephone interview from london that 20000 to 30000 civilians 
were fighting alongside his forces whose strength he refused to 
reveal 
siad barre has been arming the people for years to fight each 
other in tribal conflicts now they are using those guns against 
him silanyo said 
richard greenfield an oxford university professor and a 
political adviser to the somali government from 197786 said he 
believed civilians were joining the rebel forces which had not 
been particularly effective until now 
i think this is the most serious confrontation that siad has 
faced in the whole of his career greenfield said 
silanyo said he did not know how many government troops were 
involved but he said scores had defected to the movement 
silanyo a former minister of commerce and planing under siad 
barre was elected the rebel movements chairman in 1984 
siad barre took power in a 1969 military coup 
silanyo said the rebel offensive was timed to coincide with the 
norths spring rainy season when the thick mud makes movement 
difficult for the governments tanks and heavy artillery

oil prices ended the week by slipping lower in 
quiet trading 
analysts said most of fridays activity involved traders trying 
to square positions taken earlier in the week when prices ticked 
upward prices of both crude and refined products weakened as 
traders sold contracts to take their profits observers said 
on the new york mercantile exchange contracts for july delivery 
of west texas intermediate the benchmark us crude closed at 
1750 per 42gallon barrel down 15 cents 
among july contracts for refined products wholesale unleaded 
gasoline settled down 062 cent at 5089 cents a gallon while

ministers of the organization of petroleum exporting countries the 
conference opens june 11 in vienna austria 
the market is more bearish going into the opec meeting than 
other recent meetings said richard redoglia of merrill lynch

the stock and bond markets have gotten a boost from news that 
the nations unemployment rose for the first time this year to 56 
percent in may 
the labor department reported friday that unemployment in may 
increased 02 percentage point from aprils 14yearlow civilian 
jobless rate of 54 percent the small may rise reflected a 
seasonally adjusted shrinking of the us labor force by 363000 
people with 536000 fewer americans at work 
wall street interpreted the figures as showing a little less 
strength in the economy than had been anticipated and thus serving 
to dampen worries about inflation somewhat 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials climbed 1885 points 
friday to 207130 extending its gain for the week to 11486 
points that surpassed the previous record weekly point rise of 
10826 set last dec 1418 although it fell well short of some 
past weekly percentage increases 
bond prices also rose in response to the jobless data pushing 
interest rates lower the yield on the treasurys closely watched 
30year bond dropped from 914 percent late thursday to 904 
percent its lowest level since late april 
however government officials and private economists cautioned 
the job figures for last month are too unreliable to suggest the 
economy is losing steam 
in other economic developments friday 
auto companies reported sales of domestic cars and trucks 
picked up in late may despite lower incentive offers and rose 148 
percent over the same period a year earlier 
the broadest measure of japans trade surplus shrank 127 
percent in april from its level of a year earlier as imports 
climbed 30 percent to record levels japanese government figures 
showed 
before the seasonal adjustments made in the governments jobless 
survey to reflect a historically burgeoning job market in may with 
the end of school terms the actual number of americans working 
increased by 317000 
a separate government survey of employer payrolls also showed 
209000 new jobs in may down from an average net gain of 250000 
new jobs monthly over the past year but reflecting a stilltight 
labor market 
janet l norwood commissioner of the bureau of labor 
statistics said it would be premature to draw any conclusions from 
the may change in the jobless rate based on her agencys household 
survey 
the unadjusted increase in may employment was very low by 
historical standards particularly when compared with a 13 million 
rise the same month a year ago ms norwood told the congressional 
joint economic committee 
private economists agreed and some even suggested the 
unemployment rate may still be on a downward trend despite the 
slight increase in may 
you really cant identify a 02 percentage point move as a 
change in the trend said chris caton an analyst for data 
resources inc in lexington mass next month it will probably go 
down a tenth of a percent
