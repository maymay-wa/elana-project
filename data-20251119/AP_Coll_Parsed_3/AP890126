the leader of this weeks 
guerrilla assault on an army base is a leftist extremist linked to 
the assassination of deposed nicaraguan dictator anastasio somoza 
sources said thursday 
government and security sources said on condition of anonymity 
that enrique gorriaran merlo directed the attack and seizure monday 
of the 3rd infantry regiments base in the northwestern buenos aires 
suburn of la tablada 
gorriaran a leader of the nowdefunct peoples revolutionary 
army is believed to have escaped during a spectacular 27hour seige 
in which army and police forces retook the base they said 
police and court investigators probed links between the attackers 
and leftwing organizations the death toll from the assault rose 
thursday to 38 with the death of a wounded police officer 
in all the dead included eight army soldiers two policemen and 
28 guerrillas nineteen guerrillas were captured 
also thursday police acting on a court order raided several 
houses in the oceanfront city of mar del plata 250 miles south of 
buenos aires authorities said three people were arrested but gave 
no other details 
in the buenos aires area on wednesday police raided about 25 
houses in what the sources said was an unsuccessful bid to nab 
gorriaran one of latin americas most notorious leftist extremists 
the peoples revolutionary army was a marxist guerrilla 
organization active in the early and mid1970s it was decimated in 
a harsh antisubversion campaign waged by armed forces leaders who 
seized power in a 1976 coup 
gorriaran however escaped arrest during the campaign and fled 
abroad in 1980 he led a team of argentine and nicaraguan guerrillas 
who assassinated somoza in the paraguayan capital of asuncion 
gorriaran himself said in published interviews somoza nicaraguas 
ousted rightwing strongman had been ousted by the leftist 
sandinistas in 1979 
when the elected government of president raul alfonsin assumed 
power in argentina in 1983 he issued a decree ordering the 
prosecution of five notorious leftist guerrillas including 
gorriaran in the same decree he ordered the trial of nine former 
leaders of the rightist armed forces for human rights abuses 
gorriaran remained a fugitive for years and was believed to be 
living abroad late last year a leftist human rights lawyer jorge 
banos asked the courts to allow gorriaran to return and face trial 
without being imprisoned 
police said one of the guerrillas killed in this weeks assault 
was identified as banos he and at least two other of the attackers 
whose names have been released by police were active in a leftist 
political group the movement everyone for the country 
the littleknown movement formed about three years ago 
denounced in early january what it said were plans for a coup by 
rightwing extremists in the armed forces those elements have led 
three shortlived but dramatic uprisings against alfonsin in 21 
months 
the army bases attackers carried a written proclamation that 
said their action was designed to preempt a coup and foment 
civilian resistance to the military 
in response to the attack alfonsin late wednesday gave the 
military a policy voice in internal security he decreed creation of 
a national security council whose members include the chiefs of 
staff of the army navy and air force along with several civilian 
officials 
until the council was created alfonsins centerleft government 
had barred the military from any role in internal security 
maintaining that it was strictly a police matter 
human rights groups have said they fear military participation 
would mean a return to the harsh antileftist repression of the late 
1970s when at least 8900 people were illegally arrested and then 
disappeared they are presumed dead 
also thursday the justice ministry said it will investigate 
allegations by carlos menem presidential candidate of the 
opposition peronist party that the assault on the base was designed 
to embarrass his party 
according to menem the motive was to enter the base do some 
damage and leave behind propaganda connecting the peronist party 
with the sectors of the army that mutinied a few days ago 
the point would be to destroy definitively to bury the image 
of the peronist party and its candidate menem offered no evidence 
to support his reasoning and no evidence has been disclosed to link 
the assault to the party

a gynecologist accused of performing 
genitalaltering surgery on women can no longer practice medicine in 
the united states the ohio medical board said wednesday 
james c burt 67 who had come under fire for his selfdescribed 
love surgery which he claimed enhanced sexual responsiveness 
offered to surrender his state medical license last week 
the surrenderrevocation approved by the board includes a 
requirement that the dayton gynecologist not practice medicine 
anywhere in the united states 
in december the board charged burt with gross immorality for 
41 alleged violations ranging from overprescribing drugs to 
performing unnecessary surgeries the board charged that the surgery 
caused sexual dysfunction emotional distress infection chronic 
pain incontinence and the need for corrective surgery in many 
patients 
at least three malpractice lawsuits are pending against burt 
each asking 3 million in damages the women say burt performed the 
surgery without their consent but burt has denied performing the 
operations without his patients permission 
in a statement accompanying the surrender of his license burt 
said his practice had always been in accordance with state laws and 
the ethics of the american medical association 
i have always striven to practice in an aboveaverage manner 
and to advance the standards of practice in my specialty the 
statement said 
burts attorney earl moore said burt had been considering 
retirement for some time and did not believe the board would treat 
him fairly because its members had been pressured by gov richard 
celeste 
moore said burt was out of dayton on wednesday and would not 
return until next week he will write and lecture and give 
seminars moore said 
the saga of dr burt is far from over hes more concerned now 
about helping his patients and friends and other doctors and may 
continue to promote his surgical technique moore said 
burts surgical practices came to public attention when the 
cbstv news show west 57th street aired a report on burts 
female circumcision technique which involves the reconstruction 
and relocation of the vagina and the removal of flesh covering the 
clitoris an external tissue that responds to sexual stimulation 
burt described the technique in his 1975 book surgery of love 
burt had faced a jan 30 hearing before the medical board but 
the panel said its acceptance of the surrenderrevocation 
eliminates the necessity for formal disciplinary hearings since 
license revocation is the maximum penalty the board can impose on a 
licensee 
in signing the surrenderrevocation burt made no admissions with 
respect to his civil liability in the medical malpactice actions 
still pending 
burt said he closed his practice jan 12 
the doctor performed 170 vaginal reconstruction operations at st 
elizabeth medical center in dayton the last in february 1987 
the hospital said tuesday an internal investigation concluded 
that all of the 170 operations were done with patient consent and 
that the hospital planned no further action against burt

some people dine by candlelight or enjoy 
walking in the moonlight but barbara and tibor bathony never 
expected to drive by flashlight 
when the headlights on their truck failed in ice fog at nearly 60 
degrees below zero eight miles from the tiny town of tok the couple 
drove the rest of the way with the guiding light of a household 
flashlight shining through the windshield 
it was like a whiteout and you try to wave the fog away mrs 
bathony said we were trying to see a little better and we turned 
the high beam on and all the lights went bad 
mrs bathony moved to juneau in september and was in fairbanks 
last weekend to get the last of her household belongings she and 
her husband left fairbanks on sunday in their truck towing a rented 
flatbed and carrying three dogs for the 600mile trip to juneau 
it was minus 53 degrees when they left fairbanks minus 57 when 
they stopped in the town of north pole and by the time they reached 
tok about 175 miles southeast none of the thermometers could be 
read any more she said 
there was little traffic which made it easier to drive by 
flashlight when the trucks headlight fuse blew she said 
nobody was as dumb as we were to leave at that temperature

a federal judge wednesday stayed the 
scheduled execution of death row inmate arthur james julius saying 
the courts need more time to address lastminute claims raised by 
his attorneys 
assistant attorney general ed carnes said the ruling by us 
district judge truman hobbs meant julius execution set for friday 
would be delayed at least a month possibly much longer 
hobbs decision came after gov guy hunt refused to grant 
clemency for julius whose mother and other relatives met with hunt 
earlier in the day 
julius was scheduled to be electrocuted at 1201 am friday for 
the 1978 murder of his cousin susie bell sanders 
ms sanders was strangled and sexually assaulted at her 
montgomery home while julius was free on an eighthour pass from a 
prison workrelease center at the time of the killing he was 
serving a life sentence for a 1972 slaying 
at issue before hobbs were defense attorneys claims that 
prosecutors failed to turn over all the materials they had 
concerning the 1978 slaying 
a montgomery county judge had refused monday to halt julius 
execution and both the alabama court of criminal appeals and the 
alabama supreme court issued similar rulings tuesday 
alabamas last execution was aug 28 1987 when wayne eugene 
ritter was electrocuted for his nontriggerman role in the slaying 
of a mobile pawn shop owner

though mainstream radio has so far chosen to 
resist the songs of they might be giants the biting lyrics and 
unique music of guitarist john flansburgh and accordion player john 
linnell have helped the twoman band build a substantial following 
our songs are question marks linnell said we leave a lot 
more stuff hanging out than other bands 
the music is simple catchy and deceptively cheerful shoehorn 
with teeth could almost be mistaken for a toothpaste commercial if 
it werent for the lyrics he wants a shoehorn the one with 
teeth people should get beat up for stating their beliefs 
and kiss me son of god would fit right into a glee club 
recital if someone could find a way around these words now i 
laugh and make a fortune off the same ones that i tortured and the 
world screams kiss me son of god 
i think whats weird about our songs is that they work much 
more on a synmbolic level than on a literal level flansburgh 
said im not trying to make it more poetic than it really is 
were not too concerned about being really explicit i think its 
better for a person listening 
linnell and flansburgh grew up in the suburbs of boston and 
became friends in high school 
we hung out with a clique of people who were likeminded 
linnell said we were on the staff of the school newspapaer the 
high school had a newspaper office so we could hang out in the 
office and we didnt have to hang out in the hallway 
linnell was the first to show interest in music playing in high 
school bands but flansburgh would eventually catch the bug 
i did sort of tape stuff at my own home and started getting 
into the punk rock thing flansburgh saidthen a friend of mine 
gave me a guitar and said play this and youll never be the 
same 
a friend was also the source of linnells accordion 
id been a keyboard player in other bands but someone gave me 
this accordion and john and i started messing around with that 
linnell said i immediately took to it i think it has the biggest 
effect on us on stage we both have instruments where we can stand 
up and move around 
after graduating from high school they went their separate ways 
but reunited in 1981 when both moved to new york and ended up in the 
same apartment building before long they were working on songs and 
did some home recordings 
but the two johns as theyre sometimes called decided to start 
performing and the response was encouraging enough for them to seek 
a recording contract 
we were considerably farther off stream when we first 
started linnell said we had done a lot of tapes that werent 
strictly music typical sort of high school experimentation its 
kind of still with us in a way 
they still didnt know what to call the group after trying out 
different names the two johns were saved by yet another friend 
he was a ventriloquist flansburgh recalled he had a list 
of names for his own performance and one of them was they might be 
giants we just decided to rip his name off 
their selftitled debut album came out at the end of 1986 to 
nearly unanimous critical acclaim and respectable sales of 100000 
copies 
it was incredibly informal linnell said all we were doing 
was taking tapes we had made and remixing them 
both the first album and lincoln their latest lp were 
released by barnone records an independent label based in hoboken 
nj lincoln consists of 18 short songs whose titles include 
purple toupee and snowball in hell 
i dont think were particulary good at writing 10minute free 
improvisational songs flansburgh said what we do is really a 
normal art form its two minutes long and its got to be catchy 
somehow once youre secure writing in that medium it seems sort of 
unlimited 
even if they might be giants has failed to rule the air waves 
the two johns are certainly kings of the telephone lines 
when flansburgh and linnell were living together in brooklyn 
flansburgh came up with the idea of dialasong by phoning 
17183876962 one can reach an answering machine that plays the 
latest they might be giants song there is no additional cost for 
the caller nor does the duo collect a profit 
it was a way for people to get our songs without having to leave 
their house said flansburgh who estimates that dialasong 
receives 100 calls a day 
we didnt want people to go into this incredibly crowded room 
with all the smoke i never went to nightclubs because were not the 
most nightlifeoriented people we could just relate to people who 
worked during the day

when the farm crisis of the 80s swept 
midamerica it took a heavy toll on iowa folks lost their land 
main streets collapsed and young people deserted their hometowns 
today however despite 1988s withering drought iowas fortunes 
are reversing the final story in a fourpart series the changing 
heartland looks at the upturn in iowas economy 
</TEXT>

when dennis keitel returned from a 
life abroad two years ago he yearned to settle on the soil he once 
called home he was ready for iowa but iowa wasnt ready for him 
jobs were scarce so was optimism people were moving out 
merchants were following but over time misery has given way to 
mending 
iowa a state that once typified the decline and despair of rural 
america is on the rebound consider keitel an iowa native who 
returned to a state thousands fled found work where two years ago 
there was none and is praising a land that not long ago was pitied 
i think this place is a gold mine says keitel a 36yearold 
engineer who grew up on an eastern iowa farm 
the iowa economy is coming on strong boasts gov terry 
branstad we know we still have a long way to go but weve come a 
long ways 
unemployment is down revenues are up and theres a sense the 
worst is over some claim a busttoboom assessment is too rosy and 
premature but the declining dollar export opportunities price 
supports and a diversifying economy have contributed to a 
turnaround consider 
the value of iowa farmland rose 204 percent in 1988 prompting 
the des moines register headline iowa dirt turns to gold again 
the increase reported in an iowa state university study was the 
largest since the mid1970s from 1981 to 1986 land values had 
plummeted 63 percent 
iowas labor force reached an alltime high in october 15 
million people working or seeking jobs unemployment was 35 
percent the lowest since november 1979 in some areas jobs 
outnumber residents mount pleasant has about 5000 people of 
working age but almost 12000 jobs 
iowa soon plans to set up a nationwide tollfree number to lure 
back exiowans who left in search of work 
iowa is expected to have a 180 million budget surplus in the 
1989 and 1990 fiscal years a panel of financial experts said in 
december although some of that will likely be eaten up with federal 
mandates 
one in five iowa farmers has substantial money troubles down 
from one in three in 198485 said neil harl an iowa state 
economics professor 
deere amp co the states largest private employer with 14800 
workers posted record fourthquarter and yearend earnings 
after six years in which iowa lost almost 100000 people the 
census bureau reported last month state population increased by 
11000 from 1987 to 1988 
despite such numbers some say last summers drought will have a 
lingering impact they also worry the states upturn is bypassing 
rural areas where schools have closed young people have departed 
and main street merchants have closed up shop 
we havent turned the corner yet by any means said dave 
ostendorf of prairiefire a rural advocacy group many of the 
rural counties still have poverty rates exceeding 20 percent 
branstad says though that no state enjoys uniform prosperity 
what we want to do is help those areas that arent doing as well to 
help themselves 
the state uses lottery proceeds for instance for economic 
development some of the money going for loans aid to local 
communities or research projects 
already the upswing and growth in the meat packing and farm 
equipment industries have helped hardhit bluecollar areas in 
waterloo unemployment fell from 88 percent last january to 43 
percent in november 
people feel weve bottomed out said jim lawrence president 
of the waterloo chamber of commerce 
deere which has a giant local operation has recalled workers a 
leather processing plant recently opened and a new ibp inc hog 
slaughtering plant is being built lawrence said 
in mason city about 1500 new jobs many of them service sector 
and healthrelated will be created in 1989 alone compared with 
about 2000 in the last five years combined said tom jolas an 
economic development consultant to the city 
iowas recovery is due in part to a declining dollar that makes 
grain and other products more competitive on the world market said 
state economist harvey siegelman 
there will be winnebagos going to europe beef to japan and 
deere tractors all over the world he said 
just as critical is iowas effort to reduce its reliance on 
agriculture 
the key to success is diversification branstad said some 
of it actually is building off the agricultural economy that already 
exists and finding new uses for products 
branstad said iowa has also targeted several industries for 
development telecommunications biotechnology pharmaceuticals and 
insurance des moines already is an insurance capital 
mount pleasant 28 miles from the mississippi river learned to 
diversify decades ago its paid off the towns business roster 
includes such corporate names as motorola cargill and goodyear a 
walmart distribution center opened in 1985 
mount pleasant is also home to a large fireplace maker a bulk 
mail distributor that claims more outgoing postage volume than las 
vegas and a school bus manufacturer 
we set an example of how we can control our own future said 
glenda griffin the local chambers vice president we appreciate 
the help of the state and federal government but we will not sit 
back and depend on them 
mount pleasant never hit the depths some iowa communities sank to 
in the mid1980s though the county unemployment rate was 81 
percent in 198283 in november it was 25 percent 
in the last six months two motels four stores and a truck stop 
have opened officials say property values rose from 45 million to 
130 million in the last decade retail sales jumped 187 percent 
from march 1986 to march 1988 
mount pleasant has also held onto its young people offering jobs 
involving computers and lasers 
there isnt a small town in the state of iowa that has any more 
sophisticated industry than we have said mayor tom vilsack 
keitel returned from saudia arabia in 1986 ending up as an 
engineer in connecticut when he couldnt find work in iowa last 
fall he found a job in mount pleasant 
iowa still has a lot to offer even with all of its problems 
he said we havent lost our sense of values the quality of life 
still means more than the almighty dollar 
vilsack has another explanation 
we cant do a lot about whats plaguing the smalltown farmer 
weve given families the opportunity to be in control of their own 
lives iowas got to take its destiny in its own hands

carnegie hall reopened in late 1986 with a 
musical question had an extensive interior renovation harmed the 
halls magic sound 
no way said larry goldman carnegies vice president hadnt 
management been so meticulous as to remove padding from the new 
seats after tests showed they absorbed more sound than the old ones 
goldman said he never worried about the acoustics he should 
have 
two years later many critics and audience members have decided 
that carnegies old sound has gone the way of its old seats 
in a tacit admission that something was lost soundabsorbent 
panels have been placed at the rear of the stage but so far the 
results are inconclusive the hall may have only begun a long search 
for its lost sonic glory 
carnegies problems raise anew the question of whether acoustics 
is science art or magic or luck 
to a certain extent youre shooting craps admits cyril 
harris an acoustician for almost 40 years there isnt a 
scientific standard for good sound different people have different 
ideas depending on what theyre used to 
sometimes local tastes enter into the equation earlier in this 
century for example bostonians were accustomed to symphony halls 
longer reverberation time philadelphians to the shorter one in the 
smaller academy of music 
orchestras and conductors who didnt travel much were shaped by 
their halls philadelphia audiences loved the sound of the 
philadelphia orchestras strings when the boston symphony orchestra 
visited town the strings sounded muddy the bostonians didnt keep 
their bows on the strings as long 
musicians critics and acousticians trade terms such as 
brilliant and dry like connoisseurs at a wine tasting 
sometimes they even mean the same thing but there is broad 
agreement on what constitutes good sound and a solid understanding 
of the physical laws of acoustics 
when you sit in a concert hall you hear two kinds of sound 
direct which comes straight from the stage and reflected which 
bounces off the wall the ceiling the shoulder of the person in 
the next seat before hitting your ear 
the first reflected sound should hit the ear 20 to 60 
milliseconds after leaving the stage and it should reverberate for 
just under two seconds the approximate time in such great halls as 
amsterdams concertgebouw bostons symphony hall and viennas 
grosser musikvereinsaal 
most of the worlds great music halls date from the late 19th 
century and share a rectangular layout irregular highly 
ornamented interior surfaces that scatter sound heavy plaster and 
wood which reflect sound well and fewer than 2800 seats 
the concert hall evolved slowly from traditional performance 
spaces such as churches and salons and successful early designers 
relied less on inspiration or theory than euphonious precedents 
this preserved some happy accidents such as the sound diffusion 
affected by elaborate wall decoration 
but pity the 19th century designer who sought to understand what 
he was doing listen to the great charles garnier architect of the 
paris opera house 
i gave myself great pains to understand this great science but 
after 15 years of labor found myself hardly in advance of where i 
stood the first day i studied tested questioned everything and i 
made finally this discovery a house to have good acoustics must be 
either long or broad high or low of wood or stone round or 
square 
in fact the paris opera looks better than it sounds its dome 
distributes sound unevenly 
garniers befuddlement might have seemed quaint to the elegantly 
dressed patrons who filed in on opening night at lincoln centers 
philharmonic hall in 1962 millions of dollars and years of 
research they were assured had created a sonic masterpiece but by 
intermission people were complaining youd see the basses 
playing but you couldnt hear them recalls cyril harris 
the consultants had designed acoustic clouds or ceiling 
panels to reflect sound but harris believes lowfrequency sound 
waves bent around them instead as a result some bass sounds were 
lost in the rafters matters likely were not helped by 
philharmonics sleek spare interior and bottle shape 
harris was last in a parade of consultants who over the next 16 
years tried to improve the halls acoustics finally it was closed 
for six months while the interior was rebuilt at a cost of onethird 
the construction price 
most say acoustics in the hall rechristened avery fisher hall 
are much improved but it continues to share the cold sound of 
many modernist concert halls built after world war ii 
money is part of the problem halls without government subsidies 
need more seats sometimes too many for good sound and many must 
accommodate a variety of performances from symphonic music to opera 
to drama with varying needs 
changes in a hall can also wreak sonic havoc though it is not 
always clear why in carnegies case one theory is that the new 
floor stage carpet paint and plaster stiffened the 
auditorium increasing reverberation another blames the removal of 
stage curtains and the filling of a hole in the acoustic shell over 
the stage moves intended to improve the sound in the front rows 
whatever the cause the result was a loss of deep bass resonance 
and a reverberation that can verge on echo even more seriously 
some musicians have complained of some difficulty hearing each other 
despite some wellpublicized fiascos acousticians and architects 
are better equipped than ever and experts say the results are 
particularly apparent in halls on college campuses and in smaller 
communities 
acousticians have learned how to shape walls that scatter sound 
in the fashion of threedimensional wall surfaces they also use 
quadratic residue diffusers textured panels mounted on 
ceilings or walls that splay sound out around a room 
lasers can show how light waves bounce around a room giving a 
clue to how sound waves move through the same space computers make 
it feasible to compile and analyze huge amounts of sound test data 
models can highlight gross defects before construction 
the designers of the orange county calif performing arts 
center for example built a onetenth scale model out of the same 
materials as the actual building they inserted tiny microphones and 
ran sound tests to make sure the unusual asymmetric design reflected 
sound to the audience soon enough 
electronically assisted resonance was first used in 1964 at the 
royal festival hall in london whose acoustic problems stemmed from 
a ceiling 12 feet too low rather than raise the roof management 
installed a series of speakers each with a microphone and an 
amplifier tuned to a certain lowfrequency band the result was 
increased reverberation 
a more recent development is something called a reflected energy 
system which picks up the sound from the stage and processes it 
electronically to add sonic reflections since such systems can be 
tinkered with some critics worry that natural sound will be lost in 
the search for perfect sound but advocates say that given the 
conflicting demands on the multipurpose concert hall nature can 
use a little help

a 17yearold french boy who came down with aids 
apparently got it from contaminated acupuncture needles researchers 
said today 
the researchers said they believe that the incidence of aids 
spread through acupuncture is very low however acupuncturists 
must be aware of the risk they said in the new england journal of 
medicine 
the researchers from the necker hospital in paris and the 
charles foix hospital in ivry france said the boy they studied had 
never had sexual intercourse and had never had a blood transfusion 
he sought treatment for acupuncture after developing tendonitis 
while training to play rugby said the researchers who included d 
vittecoq of necker hospital and jp bouchon of charles foix 
hospital 
last march the us centers for disease control in atlanta 
reported the identification of two cases of aids in people with no 
risk factors who had received acupuncture

sir edmund hillary says mount everest 
should get a rest 
why because its there as are the armies of explorers elbowing 
each other up and down the mountain in all types of weather and 
leaving behind their trash 
hillary one of the first two men to climb the worlds tallest 
peak suggests a moratorium on the mountain with no one scaling 
everest for five years 
there have been far too many expeditions jostling their way up 
mount everest hillary said wednesday in an interview with the 
associated press you find them in premonsoon postmonsoon and 
even in winter season from various sides of the mountain and a a 
great deal of rubbish and junk has been left on the mountain 
hillary who is new zealands ambassador to nepal and india 
climbed everest with sherpa guide tenzing norgay in 1953 since 
then the 29028foot mountain has been conquered 260 times both 
from the nepal and tibet sides 
you know nature has a great ability to rehabilitate itself and 
i believe that if the mountain was closed down for expeditions for 
five years that much of rubbish would disappear down under the snow 
down into the basin said hillary 69 and the mountain would 
become rather cleaner and more wholesome again 
i think we owe it to the mountain not to constantly harass it 
as it has been in the past 10 or 15 years he added 
an official at the ministry of tourism which issues climbing 
permits said climbers have sought to reserve everest through the 
end of the century 
the official refused to comment on hillarys suggestion of a 
temporary ban on expeditions but noted that nepals regulations 
call for climbers to clean up after themselves before they leave the 
mountain 
glenn porzak president of the american alpine club said the 
issue was discussed at his organizations recent annual meeting 
the consensus feeling was that that was not the solution to the 
problem he said in boulder colo the solution was to educate 
each of the expeditions that go to everest and to instill in them 
more of an environmental ethic so they bring down all of what they 
take up to the mountain 
porzak said pm shrestha undersecretary of tourism in nepal 
has indicated that closing the mountain is not under consideration 
if anything theyre definitely going the other way porzak 
said noting that nepal has been issuing more climbing permits and 
that it relies on the revenue 
nepal and china have been allowing more than one expedition on 
the same route at the same time he said so theres a whole lot 
more traffic and with the traffic theres a greater potential for 
some expeditions to leave their gear on the mountain once theyre 
done porzak said i would favor limiting the number of teams on 
the mountain 
but closing off the mountain for five years would be a little 
bit akin to what president carter did in terms of boycotting the 
olympics thats not the ultimate solution added porzak who is 
leaving in a month and a half to climb everest 
george band president of londons alpine club the worlds 
oldest mountaineering society says that instead of a fiveyear 
moratorium it may be a more practical gesture to have not more 
than two or three expeditions to each mountain at a time each 
season 
on everest there are two seasons before and after the monsoon 
which breaks in june so climbers are tackling the mountain in may 
or october said band who was in hillarys 1953 expedition he 
added that worst problem was increased numbers of sherpas cooking 
with firewood and depleting the shrubbery which could cause erosion 
hillary said that because hundreds have climbed everest we 
cant feel sorry for those who may not get the opportunity over the 
next few years 
after all for many many years when everest was being 
attempted before 1953 nobody was successful in climbing it he 
said but it has now been climbed more than 200 times so how can 
one say that one is a bit unlucky let them wait for five 
years 
everest gets more rough treatment than any other peak because 
there are expeditions from both the nepalese and chinese sides and 
people tend to stay on it longer because it is the tallest he said 
so i feel it would be good to at least set the example 
and choose everest the biggest of all the peaks and let it rest 
for five years and then maybe let people come back again

at least 15 political prisoners were beaten 
and put in solitary confinement because their complaints of ill 
treatment were published by amnesty international and other human 
rights groups relatives say 
more than a dozen relatives of prisoners interviewed over the 
past week told the associated press the 15 inmates began a hunger 
strike jan 19 to protest their treatment at jordans newly built 
swaqa prison 
interior minister rajai dajani on wednesday denied the 
allegations it is not true at all he said in comments relayed 
by information minister hani khasawneh 
he said swaqa about 50 miles south of amman is a reform and 
rehabilitation center rather than a prison 
prisoners relatives say swaqa holds 163 political prisoners 
most of them members of leftist or extremist palestinian factions 
several of those groups advocate or have attempted the overthrow of 
king hussein the jordanian leader 
the relatives spoke on condition of anonymity saying some of 
them were warned by security services not to speak about the matter 
they said the swaqa prison director summoned all political 
prisoners jan 17 and told them officials were angered by reports 
from amnesty international and other human rights groups about 
torture and detention without trial 
relatives said 15 of the prisoners were called in front of the 
group and some were beaten on the soles of their feet while others 
were beaten while suspended backward over a pole with their hands 
bound to their feet 
the heads wethe 15 were then shaved and they were placed into 
solitary confinement the relatives said they said at least three 
other prisoners have since joined those in solitary confinement 
in a dec 14 report amnesty called on jordan to hold a full 
and independent investigation of reported beatings and at least 
one flogging at swaqa in october the londonbased organization 
noted such treatment would be a violation of jordanian law 
in november reports amnesty expressed concern about the 
detention without trial of 22 alleged members of the marxist popular 
front for the liberation of palestine it said most if not all of 
them appear to have been tortured during their interrogation at 
the general intelligence department in amman 
relatives of the political prisoners said two of those beaten and 
confined last week were among the seven mentioned in the december 
amnesty report maher abu ayash and jamal ibralim ali nsour 
the relatives said about 80 political prisoners are held at the 
general intelligence department in amman and 21 at the army prison 
in zarqa east of the capital 
human rights groups have reported instances of torture in most 
middle eastern countries and jordan is generally considered to use 
it less than most jordanian judges sometimes reject the confessions 
of mistreated defendants according to lawyers in amman

israeli media allege a palestinian popular 
army is being financed and armed by yasser arafats faction of the 
plo but some palestinians say the army exists largely on paper 
israeli security forces tuesday arrested dozens of people 
suspected of belonging to the alleged army 
some palestinians say the popular army is an attempt to 
coordinate groups of activists who enforce general strikes patrol 
neighborhoods and punish collaborators in the 13month uprising 
against israeli rule of the occupied territories 
palestinian journalist daoud kuttab said tuesday that israel was 
blowing the significance of the issue out of proportion for its 
publicity value 
its a game of semantics he said of the term popular 
army 
kuttab who has wide contacts in the palestine liberation 
organization called existing groups of activists strike forces 
that use stones not guns in their clashes with israeli soldiers 
in announcing tuesdays arrests israeli military officials said 
the popular army was led by fatah arafats arm of the plo 
israel claims arafat lied when as part of a diplomatic 
initiative he said last month that the plo renounced terrorism and 
recognized the jewish state 
the key suspect in the arrests abdel fatah hassan received 
weapons and money from fatah and trained dozens of youths for 
attacks against israeli troops and civilians israel radio said 
the squads were based in the town of tulkarem in the 
israelioccupied west bank and were to train hundreds of others 
in the territory according to the radio 
an israeli army spokesman said he did not know what kind of 
weapons were involved 
an army official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
plo continually tries to smuggle money and arms into the west bank 
and occupied gaza strip 
the official said he did not know the size and scope of activity 
of the popular army but that the israeli army did not see it as 
a sign that the palestinian uprising was becoming an armed struggle 
a recent plo statement said the popular army was being formed 
under the auspices of fatahs force17 and had thousands of members 
in the occupied lands 
a leaflet circulated last week announced the formation of the 
palestinian popular army and urged attacks on israeli soldiers 
and jewish settlers 
still there have been no indications of an armed military force 
in the occupied lands since the rebellion began in december 1987 
in recent months palestinian youths often wearing identical 
jackets or black plastic garbage bags done up as ponchos have 
staged military marches in towns and villages some were armed 
with clubs slingshots and hatchets 
one such march took place jan 1 in the village of abu falah on 
the west bank residents said 300 to 400 youths took part and drew 
2500 spectators in the local schoolyard 
a video of the parade viewed by the associated press showed 
youths carrying outlawed palestinian flags marchers wore keffiyehs 
the checkered arab headdress considered a symbol of palestinian 
nationalism but the youths were not dressed uniformly some were 
preteens who appeared to be playing soldier games 
three tv crews reportedly filmed the parade and residents 
sprayed slogans in english and hebrew on walls near the schoolyard 
apparently for the benefit of the journalists a hebrew slogan read 
long live abu amar arafats code name 
kuttab and other palestinians said such military posturing did 
not mean a real palestinian army existed this is more of a 
symbolic gesture to keep up morale among residents he said 
some palestinians suggested however that improved coordination 
among strike forces could serve as the seed for a broadbased 
guerrilla force if the uprising drags on 
some plo factions in the underground unified national leadership 
of the uprising reportedly oppose the notion of a popular army 
arguing it would only serve as propaganda fodder for the israelis 
and possibly provoke israeli reprisals 
if there was feuding over the issue the opponents appear to have 
won 
kuttab noted that no mention of the popular army was made in 
the unified leaderships latest leaflet which was circulated monday 
in the occupied lands

ronald h brown the establishment lawyer who 
played a key backstage role in jesse jacksons antiestablishment 
presidential campaign is poised to take the spotlight himself as 
the first black to head a major political party in the united states 
browns ascension to the democratic party chairmanship became all 
but certain wednesday when he was endorsed by his chief rival for 
the post 
it was a remarkably swift triumph for the 47yearold political 
veteran who grew up in harlem but attended predominantly white 
schools on new yorks upper east side 
his parents were graduates of howard university one of the 
nations premier black colleges but they sent their only child to 
middlebury college in vermont where he was one of the few blacks 
he now serves on the colleges board of trustees and is chairman of 
the board of the kennedy institute for politics at harvard 
brown worked for sen edward m kennedy and studied law under 
mario cuomo his ties to the democratic partys liberal wing are 
firm and were cited by opponents to his bid for the party 
chairmanship 
former rep jim jones of oklahoma who said he was remaining in 
the race at least long enough to assess if he had a chance to win 
said the question for democrats is whether were going to be 
perceived as mainstream or to the left of the mainstream 
the breakthrough for brown came when richard wiener chairman of 
the michigan democratic party abruptly announced i am ending my 
campaign for democratic national chair 
from the outset of my campaign i have stated that the next 
chair of our party would be either myself or ron brown and 
properly so by taking this action today i believe that this race 
has effectively ended and that ron brown will achieve a firstballot 
victory 
the democratic national committee will elect the new chairman on 
feb 10 
in a statement thanking wiener for his support brown said i 
now have more than enough votes to win the chair of the dnc i am 
very very pleased and look forward to leading a united party for 
the next four years 
he said his first priority would be to reach out to all 
democrats our strength as a party depends upon our ability to 
appeal to americans in every region with a message of strength and 
hope 
the only other candidate remaining in the race was former rep 
james stanton of ohio who had no immediate comment on the latest 
development 
assuming that brown succeeds paul g kirk jr as chairman he may 
face tough sledding achieving his goal of uniting the party 
particularly in the south 
ron is probably the most qualified guy in the race said 
florida democratic party chairman charles whitehead but the 
perception in this state is that ron is jesses and teds and 
labors guy it poses a political problem a little bit in 
florida 
but whitehead said he would do anything i can to help ron 
overcome that perception 
less amenable to a brown victory was alabama chairman john baker 
who has said it would represent a triumph for the ultraliberal 
wing of the party baker said he would ignore a national party 
headed by brown 
southern opponents of brown argued that election of a liberal as 
chairman would drive from the democratic party those whites who have 
remained loyal a dwindling bloc in recent elections 
brown has portrayed the opposition to his candidacy as racially 
motivated 
people will look you in the face and say you have the 
credentials for the job but he said it is raceconscious 
behavior 
he said the only way to overcome that attitude is to put light 
on it and make people address it 
for a decade brown moved smoothly through the capitals corridors 
of power winning ready acceptance when he ran the urban leagues 
washington office and then as kennedys general counsel and staff 
director on the senate judiciary committee 
he was deputy manager of kennedys unsuccessful challenge of 
president jimmy carter for the 1980 democratic presidential 
nomination 
when that campaign ended brown accepted an offer to become a 
partner in one of the capitals major law firms with clients that 
included the japanese electronics industry and the government of 
haiti brown earned a sixfigure salary and drove a jaguar 
he and his wife alma have a son michael who is in law school 
and a daughter tracy who is a senior at boston college 
while pursuing his lucrative law practice brown remained active 
in democratic party affairs 
jackson was rebuffed when he tried to recruit brown to manage his 
presidential campaign but in may 1988 when only jackson and 
michael dukakis remained in the race brown agreed to serve as 
jacksons convention manager 
while democrats were certain dukakis would be their nominee they 
were troubled by the question what does jesse want jackson was 
sending mixed signals about the vice presidential nomination and his 
demands for platform planks 
but brown managed to deflect a potentially divisive platform 
debate over middle east policy and was instrumental in arranging the 
conventions closingnight show of unity when jackson and his 
family joined dukakis at the podium

former white house aide oliver north has 
subpoenaed two house members and a pile of congressional documents 
in an apparent attempt to show he could not have misled congress 
about his activities because lawmakers already knew what he was 
doing 
the defense in the irancontra case wants reps lee hamilton 
dind and dave mccurdy dokla to testify in court about their 
dealings with north in 1985 and 1986 on the subject of whether the 
united states was aiding the contra rebels fighting nicaraguas 
leftist sandinista government 
im willing to cooperate to the extent i have any direct 
knowledge mccurdy said wednesday in a brief interview he said he 
assumed the defense was primarily interested in his account of an 
aug 6 1986 meeting of house intelligence committee members with 
north in the white house situation room 
hamilton had no comment on the subpoena but when broad 
conspiracy charges against north were dropped earlier this month 
hamilton said the remaining counts amounted to a strong criminal 
case against the retired marine lieutenant colonel the remaining 
counts against north include charges of lying to congress 
two intelligence committee staff members also have been 
subpoenaed by norths lawyers along with documents from the 
intelligence foreign affairs and armed services committees 
at the white house meeting with lawmakers in august 1986 north 
concealed the us role in resupplying the nicaraguan rebels and 
admitted when he testified before congressional investigating 
committees in 1987 that he had done so 
but norths defense apparently intends to show that congress knew 
about the supply effort either from other sources or from 
information disclosed by north himself on other occasions according 
to the house response 
mccurdy however said he he knew nothing about norths 
involvement with the resupply effort until disclosure of the 
irancontra scandal three months after the white house meeting 
in a 22page motion to quash portions of the subpoenas for 
documents house counsel steven r ross argued that they were too 
broad and based on an incredible theory that north was only 
concealing things the committees already knew 
north reasons that hence no crimes occurred for what the house 
knew north could not conceal from it the motion argued 
congress has not legalized obstruction on the grounds that 
others may make up the truth deficit 
at a court hearing wednesday us district judge gerhard gesell 
said subpoenaing congressmen must be approached with some degree 
of accommodation and that were not going to pull them off the 
floor of congress to testify at norths trial which is scheduled 
to begin tuesday 
at the time of the white house meeting hamilton was intelligence 
committee chairman and mccurdy was a member of the panel hamilton 
is no longer a member but mccurdy recently rejoined the committee 
a hearing was scheduled for friday to hear all objections to 
norths subpoenas including those seeking testimony from former 
president reagan and president bush 
in his motion to quash parts of the document subpoenas ross said 
the house cannot be compelled to submit its investigative files to 
outside inquiries but would be willing to do so where the material 
is relevant to prosecution or defense of charges involving crimes 
where the house is a victim 
we have no desire to withhold evidence which is material and 
relevant ross said 
north was seeking everything the house committees have regarding 
providing support to the contras by private benefactors third 
countries john singlaub robert owen who was norths courier to 
the contras and codefendant richard secord whom north enlisted to 
run the resupply operation 
north subpoenaed the whole set of records of the intelligence 
panels probe of the contra resupply operation which began after a 
contra resupply plane with american crewman eugene hasenfus aboard 
was shot down in nicaragua in october 1986 
four of the 12 criminal charges remaining against north are that 
in 1985 he concealed from congress his efforts on behalf of the 
contras to raise funds arrange arms shipments and offer tactical 
advice 
another count says he concealed similar information at the white 
house meeting and he is charged additionally with obstructing 
congress in november 1986 by altering destroying and concealing 
documents on the iran arms shipments and aid to the contras

congressmen say they believe the bush 
administration will pay more attention to housing problems than 
reagan did and several bills are in the works to outline the 
programs and find ways to pay for them 
being counted among the reasons for optimism is bushs selection 
of a former member of the house jack kemp for secretary of housing 
and urban development 
im delighted he has been chosen sen alan cranston 
dcalif chairman of the housing subcommittee of the senate 
committee on banking housing and urban affairs said wednesday i 
think hes very bright and knows how the legislative process works 
cranston said he and other members of the committee have met with 
kemp and feel he is interested in housing problems and receptive to 
their ideas despite differences they have with some of kemps past 
proposals 
kemp has supported the transfer and sale of public housing to 
tenants housing vouchers as a way of giving lowincome tenants 
expanded choices in the private market and urban enterprise zones to 
encourage economic development in the inner cities 
cranston and new york sen alfonse damato the ranking 
republican on the housing panel plan to cosponsor a comprehensive 
housing bill designed to help the homeless the firsttime 
homembuyer lowand moderateincome people and the elderly and 
handicapped 
the proposal would cost 31 billion in the first year cranston 
said but you cant do anything without funds 
many on capitol hill say theyre encouraged that bush and kemp 
seem amenable to restoring some federal funds that had been cut 
under reagan 
federal funds for lowincome housing have been cut 75 percent 
since 1981 and reagans 1990 budget request includes only half the 
funding authorized by congress under the stewart b mckinney 
homeless assistance act 
bush pledged full funding of the mckinney act during the 
presidential campaign and kemp has said he believes the 1986 tax 
reform may have gone too far in reducing incentives for the 
construction and rehabilitation of affordable housing 
legislation being developed by senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine and sen john danforth rmo would begin to 
address kemps concern by making permanent the tax credits which 
were set to expire at the end of this year for investors in 
lowincome housing 
bills introduced in the house would duplicate some of the efforts 
in the senate by establishing a national housing trust to provide 
assistance to firsttime homebuyers make grants to local 
governments to convert closed school building to shelters for the 
homeless and expand current programs to provide federal asssitance 
for the homeless

national standards are needed to improve 
mathematics teaching in the united states but a uniform curriculum 
such as the kind found in japan and other countries would be 
impractical the national research council said in a report issued 
today 
the report everybody counts stressed that standards must be 
flexible enough to allow for regional differences and that local 
teachers and parents must be deeply involved in decisionmaking 
the council an arm of the national academy of sciences studied 
us mathematics education from kindergarten to graduate school 
countries with topdown systems in which all children in a 
certain grade study the same material the same way have beaten us 
handsdown in teaching math the report says 
but imitating japan and other topdown countries will not work 
here because of the long us traditions of local initiatives and 
decentralized authority the report said the answer is to establish 
appropriate national expectations based upon broad public 
support 
a major step toward national standards is expected early this 
year when the national council of teachers of mathematics publishes 
curriculum and evaluation standards for school mathematics 
the upcoming nctm report is the first effort ever to establish 
national expectations for school mathematics the research council 
says 
a recent surge of studies and books has underscored growing 
concern over the nations mathematical prowess the research council 
in its report today noted a number of specific problems in the math 
education field among them 
too many students leave school without knowing enough math for 
productive lives and on average us students do not master math 
basics at a level sufficient to sustain our present technologically 
based society 
courses and instruction at our schools and colleges are years 
behind the times undergraduate math is intellectually stagnant 
overgrown with stale courses 
us students lag far behind students of other nations in math 
achievement plus its socially acceptable here to do badly in math 
encouraging low expectations 
the shortage of qualified math teachers is more serious than in 
any other area of us education and affects all levels from 
elementary to graduate school the shortage of minority math 
teachers is particularly acute 
calculators and computers have had virtually no impact on 
instruction despite great potential to enrich it and standardized

police said they were led on a search 
for an elusive snow snake by a man who didnt want to admit he 
was bitten on the lip by a pet snake he was kissing good night 
the hunt began early tuesday after eric johnson was bitten and 
taken to a hospital in nearby rock springs for treatment doctors 
there demanded to know what kind of snake had bitten him in order to 
treat him 
johnson and a friend shawn macdonald 19 initially told police 
that johnson had been walking through town when he saw a snake in 
the snow authorities said johnson told them the snake bit him when 
he picked it up to look at it 
adding to the mystery were slithering shapes johnson and 
macdonald had made in the snow to add substance to their story 
according to police 
however the hunt was called off shortly after doctors told 
johnson he was going to die if they didnt find out what kind of 
snake had bitten him police officer don holthaus said wednesday 
johnson then confessed that he had been bitten by a pygmy 
rattlesnake belonging to macdonald and that he had made up the story 
of finding one in the snow police said 
i guess what had happened they were playing around with the 
snake and he johnson said he was going to kiss it good night and 
it kissed him first said holthaus they were worried the snake 
was going to be destroyed so they drew tracks in the snow 
johnson who was listed in critical condition for a while is 
recovering said the officer and the snake has been returned to 
macdonald

this christian enclave is 
becoming a test ground for an often violent campaign by moslem 
fundamentalists that challenges the plo leadership of the 
palestinian uprising 
fundamentalists in black ski masks torch the shops of bethlehem 
merchants who refuse to follow strike orders and fight plo followers 
with stones and clubs in an attempt to assert control 
since we believe that the uprising is godmade we think the 
fundamentalists have the right to lead it said samer a 
25yearold bethlehem barber active in hamas or zeal a 
moslem fundamentalist group that opposes plo moves to seek a 
compromise with israel 
like others interviewed samer gave only his first name for fear 
of retribution by rival palestinians or israeli troops 
friction between the two groups of palestinians has often erupted 
in the occupied lands during the 13monthold revolt against israeli 
rule but only in the bethlehem area is there active resistance to 
the fundamentalists mainly because beleaguered christians fear 
islamic domination 
christian palestinians are traditionally aligned with the 
palestine liberation organization which advocates a secular 
democratic palestine 
about 30000 christians live in bethlehem and the adjacent towns 
of beit jallah and beit sahour but their influence is being edged 
out by the fastgrowing moslem community about 23000 moslems live 
in the three towns and 40000 others occupy nearby refugee camps 
and villages 
the christians feel their rights are being trampled on by the 
fundamentalists said kamal a 22yearold bethlehem grocery clerk 
active in the fatah faction of plo chief yasser arafat 
the battle between hamas and the plo has been played out mainly 
when general strikes are staged by the rival groups residents of 
bethlehem beit jallah and beit sahour have repeatedly defied hamas 
strike orders 
three months ago hamas strikeenforcers battled plo leftists who 
encouraged merchants to defy a hamas strike 
when the merchants saw they had support they started 
calling hamas names samer said our people and the plo 
leftists started throwing stones at each other 
in another incident a clash erupted between the two sides in 
manger square the citys tourist center near where the bible says 
jesus was born 
hamas stepped up retaliatory attacks after bethlehem merchants 
stayed open during a hamas strike dec 31 later that day masked 
hamas enforcers torched a shoe store and a parked bus and tried to 
set fire to a toy shop 
the violence and threats have produced results 
during a hamas strike last sunday bethlehem merchants for the 
first time kept their shops closed without pressure from enforcers 
though their colleagues in beit jallah and beit sahour were again 
defiant 
bethlehems market near manger square was deserted except for 
sidewalk vendors selling bread and newspapers which is allowed 
during strikes taxis and buses stopped running and slogans 
scribbled on walls read today is a strike day we warn you to 
close your shops 
salem an owner of two bakeries said he kept his shop shut for 
the first time during a hamas strike 
im afraid theyll burn my shops down he said last week 
i got a letter of warning because i had opened on a previous 
strike 
george a christian who owns three groceries said he complied 
with the strike after assailants smashed his car window last week 
and left behind a note reading this time it is the window and 
the next time it will be your shops 
plo activists have accused hamas of harming the uprising by 
fueling division but hamas defends its tactics 
we are trying to show our presence and we have to use force 
said samer sitting in his immaculate barber shop occasionally 
stroking his neatly trimmed black beard 
frictions between the rivals increased last month after arafat 
launched his diplomatic initiative by recognizing israel and 
renouncing terrorism 
such concessions are anathema to the fundamentalists who call 
for a holy war against israel and demand an islamic state in all 
of former palestine including israeli territory 
what was taken by force must be returned by force said 
samer palestine must be an islamic state 
breaking the plos grip in bethlehem would be a major victory for 
the fundamentalists who have a strong following in the occupied 
gaza strip and have also made inroads elsewhere in the west bank 
samer a bornagain moslem who defected from arafats fatah 
claims fundamentalists now outnumber plo activists in bethlehem and 
nearby christian towns 
others disagree hamas as no support in these places said 
daoud kuttab a palestinian journalist with wide plo contacts he 
said plo factions elsewhere chose not to fight hamas only to keep 
the uprising unified 
kamal the fatah activist said the battle in bethlehem is not 
over well stop hamas he declared

fledgling guardian angels have begun earning their 
wings under the guidance of founder curtis sliwa whose 
crimefighting group is catching as much criticism in britain as on 
the other side of the atlantic 
sliwa and three fellow angels wearing their trademark red 
berets told 22 recruits at a london gym on wednesday to be careful 
out there 
flash and panache just wont work you gotta remain cool and 
calm the new yorker told the new recruits you dont have to be 
a muscle man to be an angel 
the group began in new york by patrolling the citys subway 
system and branched out into 60 cities in the united states canada 
and mexico typically local law enforcement officials resent the 
groups presence 
london has been no different 
critics of the group say they are opposed to the guardian angels 
plans to patrol the london underground the subway system plagued by 
a recent rise in crime 
such a move will undoubtedly increase the level of insecurity 
and tension on the underground and could lead to gang wars and more 
violent incidents said john prescott in charge of transport for 
the opposition labor party 
the angels he said could become sitting ducks hunting the 
red beret vigilantes could become a late night weekend sport 
romany rix a 16yearold london recruit said she believed in 
sliwas philosophy 
im no butch or bully but through the angels i can help rid 
london of crime the gentle way she said after sliwa explained the 
threemonth training course in law fitness selfdefense and 
psychology 
despite the criticism sliwa maintained the public supports the 
idea of guardian angels in britain 
he and his wife and cofounder lisa sliwa toured london 
manchester and birmingham for two weeks last fall to sound out their 
ideas 
so many people tell us they will no longer use the tube 
subway they never see any security they would welcome people in 
red berets said sliwa who was questioned for seven hours by 
customs officials at gatwick airport on tuesday before he and the 
other angels were granted sixmonth visas 
a spokesman for the home office which is responsible for law 
enforcement said the implications of a uniformed squad acting 
outside the properly authorized police forces is offensive to many 
citizens and could in fact promote confrontation and disorder 
so long as they keep within the law however there are no 
powers to prevent their traveling as normal farepaying passengers 
on the tube he said speaking on condition of anonymity

a veteran cuban diplomat who defected to the 
united states says he was a regular participant in a 
palestinianbacked gunrunning operation on behalf of rebel groups 
in three latin american countries 
hector aguililla saladrigas who spent most of his 14year 
diplomatic career involved in middle east affairs said he defected 
last fall after becoming disillusioned with cubas subversive 
activities and widespread official corruption 
aguilillas defection was not publicly disclosed until the state 
department made him available for an interview tuesday with the 
associated press 
he had been assigned to the cuban embassy in madagascar but last 
oct 10 during a transit stop while en route to take up his duties 
there he asked us officials for political asylum for himself his 
wife and two children aged 13 and 10 he declined to say where the 
request was made 
much of his time since his defection has been spent in cia 
debriefings 
aguililla 35 offered a rare glimpse into the role cuba has 
played in cooperation with palestinian radicals in the shadowy 
international arms trafficking business 
he said that with palestinian help cuba arranged for the 
transport of large quantities of westernmade weaponry to guerrilla 
groups in el salvador guatemala and chile and also provides 
training of a terrorist nature to palestinian militants 
aguililla said that between 1980 and 1983 while he served as the 
second ranking official at the cuban embassy in damascus he 
routinely made trips to lebanons bekaa valley where the trunk of 
his car was loaded with rifles pistols revolvers and smoke bombs 
he said palestinian groups particularly two promarxist 
factions were the principal source of weaponry which he was able 
to transport back to syria without a customs check because of the 
diplomatic plates on his car 
on occasion he said a top cuban intelligence officer flew to 
damascus for largerscale arms transfers 
weapons of us israeli or italian manufacture were favored 
because socialist involvement in the arms trafficking scheme 
could thus be concealed he said 
the palestinians were a good source of western arms because 
they had a lot of contacts to get them he added 
the policy of cuba has always been to export the revolution 
aguililla said as he recounted his experiences in the 75minute 
interview he referred on occasion to a single page of typewritten 
notes he used as a memory aid 
speaking in spanish while chainsmoking cigarettes aguililla 
said he does not know if the arms smuggling operation by way of 
syria continued beyond 1983 because he left the country in early 
1984 since then he served brief stints at the cuban embassies in 
iran and kuwait 
aguililla said he was troubled by evidence of widespread official 
corruption in cuba a problem that has been acknowledged by 
president fidel castro 
but castro nonetheless contends that the revolution has produced 
hundreds of thousands of selfless individuals who volunteer for 
social welfare projects at home and in numerous third world 
countries 
the cuban diplomatic mission here was apprised of aguilillas 
allegations on wednesday but spokesman angel pino refused comment 
according to aguililla wilma espin a member of the politburo 
and head of the federation of cuban women once helped herself 
during a visit to damascus to a fund that embassy women had 
contributed to for parties and toys for children and used the money 
for shopping 
orlando fundora formerly the chief ideologue of the revolution 
stopped once in damascus aguililla said and asked him to exchange 
money on the black market 
he was supposed to be the model of socialist morality but 
nonetheless he violated the law of that country aguililla added 
as a costcutting measure the cuban foreign ministry sent 
dollars in cash to the embassy in tehran with the understanding that 
the currency would be exchanged on the black market at windfall 
profit rates 
an enterprising group of cuban diplomats in peru shipped frozen 
beef via the diplomatic pouch to coconspirators at the foreign 
ministry in havana aguililla said adding that the beef was then 
sold privately at a hefty profit

president bush gave an interview to a pair of 
reporters then had the transcript released to the white house press 
corps as part of his effort to make himself more accessible in 
exchange for limiting shouted questions 
bush was interviewed wednesday in the oval office by two 
reporters from the new york times and the houston post the 
journalists then wrote a pool report relaying the gist of the 
presidents remarks to their colleagues the white house also 
released a transcript of the interview 
only after bush gave the interview did press secretary marlin 
fitzwater hold his daily news briefing he was joined there by chief 
of staff john sununu making his first appearance in the white house 
press room 
fitzwater said bush planned to follow up on wednesdays interview 
by granting more such questionandanswer sessions to small groups 
of reporters he also said the white house was considering excluding 
reporters from some events at which bush is being photographed 
well well see how it goes the spokesman told reporters who 
raised several questions about that alternative were looking for 
various alternative ways of letting the press ask questions of the 
president this is just one technique 
during his transition to the presidency bush had served notice 
that he would not permit spontaneous questions during such sessions 
such questioning occurred regularly during the reagan years 
particularly when the president posed for pictures with visiting 
foreign leaders cabinet members of congressional leaders 
bush also pledged that he would be fully accessible to the media 
saying reporters would feel less need to shout questions during 
these occasions and thus behave in a more dignified manner but he 
never committed himself to a specific number of formal news 
conferences 
former president ronald reagan occasionally granted oval office 
interviews but seldom agreed to have a group of reporters a 
pool come in and question him and subsequently report his 
remarks to their colleagues 
reagan however seemed to enjoy the spontaneous exchanges with 
reporters during picturetaking sessions and while he was getting on 
and off helicopters and airplanes 
former president gerald r ford often agreed to talk to 
reporters with little advance notice and even held 
questionandanswer sessions on the white house grounds

you can play in peoria but if youre in a 
bit of a fix youll have to pay 
as of wednesday the police and fire departments stopped rescuing 
kittens from trees pumping flooded basements or handling any number 
of extra duties that once were considered routine the new policy 
has prompted some to wonder if this quintessential midwest town is 
losing its heartland values 
peorias definitely losing its smalltown flavor but we think 
its more important to be prepared to respond to emergencies rather 
than spending time and money on extracurricular activities like 
these says fire marshal g john parker 
parker explained that financial concerns prompted officials to 
stop helping residents who are locked out of their homes or 
motorists who have locked their keys inside their cars unless its 
an emergency 
it is a sign of the times parker said we just cant do 
all the things we traditionally have done 
peoria has continued to provide these services while other 
communities of this size eliminated them long ago we need to be 
more concerned about protecting citizens lives and property 
especially in the face of reduced manpower and budget cuts 
chicago police said they stopped opening car doors long ago 
we tell them to go to a locksmith its been that way during my 
12 years on the police force said a chicago police official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
some here see the change as a sign that city government is 
getting too big in peoria the states thirdlargest city with 
127000 residents 
councilman james polk is fighting the change because he doesnt 
want peoria to lose its identity 
peoria is big enough to offer a lot of the same opportunities 
as a city like chicago yet its small enough to keep our basic 
midwestern values polk said 
this program is important because it brings our police officers 
and firefighters closer to the people they provide an essential 
public service and it helps develop respect in the community for the 
police 
some wont mind the changes 
at a minimum 20 to open a locked car locksmiths will welcome 
the 5899 calls received last year at the peoria police department 
the fire department answered 80 calls last year from lockedout 
residents 
no longer will the locksmiths have to monitor police radios to 
listen for distress calls from motorists and try to beat police to 
the scene instead the city will simply forward the calls to 
private businesses on a rotating basis 
the private sectors gain will be a relief to parker who said 
his department is struggling to survive on 72 million a year and 
was forced to cut 12 of its 170 firefighters last year 
i dont feel that we have any choice parker said 
we dont have the luxury for these types of services anymore 
we have to make sure our machines and manpower are in position to 
respond to true emergencies but im sure well hear a lot of 
criticism

the decision to deny drug czardesignate 
william j bennett a place in the cabinet calls into question the 
president bushs commitment to the war on drugs say congressmen who 
are urging him to reconsider 
if the administration is going to keep the high profile it says 
drugs is going to be then i think there has to be room at the table 
so that at every cabinet meeting there is a presence at the table 
of this problem said rep bob dornan rcalif 
and sen joseph biden jr ddel who fought for years to create 
a drug czar post to ride herd over the numerous federal agencies 
involved in the drug war complained that the decision would 
relegate the drug issue to subcabinet status 
but white house spokesman marlin fitzwater indicated wednesday 
the decision would not change 
i havent talked to him but bill bennetts position has very 
specific statutory responsibilities quite powerful and 
farreaching and i dont think he has any concern about cabinet 
status fitzwater said 
the president can confer cabinet status upon anyone he wants 
but he would like to keep the cabinet small and i dont think bill 
bennett is upset he said 
when bennett was appointed jan 12 to the job of director of 
national drug control policy he said he looked forward to working 
with my colleagues in the cabinet 
but bennett aide john walters said bennett didnt consider the 
decision a serious problem and noted bush and bennett had lunch 
together monday 
we have no doubt about george bushs seriousness about the drug 
issue and his seriousness about his commitment to bill bennett as 
the guy in charge of this issue for him is a strong as ever 
walters said 
a transition official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
bennett was kind of surprised to discover he had not been 
invited to a cabinet meeting monday but that he would like to 
have the freedom not to be there 
hes got a lot of work to do and doesnt need to be there for 
discussions of acid rain and the ozone layer he said referring 
to some of the topics that occupied hours of cabinet meetings when 
bennett was education secretary under president reagan 
several congressmen joked that bennett was left out of the 
cabinet meeting for want of a chair and they offered solutions 
we may have to appropriate some money for an extra chair so he 
can get into the cabinet room but we hope he will be there 
alongside the president and have the ear of the president said 
rep benjamin gilman rny ranking minority member of the house 
select committee on narcotics abuse and control 
dornan said congress had anticipated the drug czar would have 
cabinet rank when it created the job by passing the drug bill in 
october 
although we did leave it to the discretion of the president we 
made the new socalled drug czar at the same pay level as all the 
other members of the cabinet and all of the various secretaries 
he said

members of the bar fear a proposal by britains 
highest law officer to revamp the legal system will turn it into a 
ruthless arena where big firms seduce talent with fat salaries and 
the ordinary citizen suffers 
the lord chancellor lord mackay of clashfern called wednesday 
for an end to the monopoly of bewigged barristers in the nations 
higher courts so solicitors may argue cases as well 
he also called for the adoption of contingency fees for civil 
suits meaning lawyers would be paid by clients only if they win a 
case 
adoption of the proposals would be a wholesale reworking of the 
structure of british courts where solicitors are the general 
practitioners who deal with the public and barristers are 
specialists who argue cases in higher courts 
in the english system of law members of the public take their 
cases to solicitors in minor cases no other lawyer may be required 
in serious criminal cases however the solicitor is obliged to 
hire a barrister to argue the case barristers must take any case 
sent their way if their time permits meaning the countrys top 
advocates are available to any client 
judges in the high courts come from the ranks of barristers and 
the bar regulates itself through traditions whose foundations are 
obscured in the mists of the middle ages true to those traditiona 
barristers wear wigs in court 
richard gaskell president of the law society that represents the 
nations 50000 solicitors welcomed the new proposals saying they 
addressed longstanding problems of a profession operating within 
an outdated framework 
but desmond fennell chairman of the general council of the bar 
strongly protested them saying they will remove the control of 
justice from the judges and entrust it to the civil servants 
the proposals for the licensing of advocates under government 
control give rise to grave constitutional dangers he told a news 
conference 
the lord chancellor gave lawyers and other interested parties 
until may 2 to comment on the proposals before the government 
publishes a white paper with specific legislation governing the 
courts of england and wales 
reflecting prime minister margaret thatchers enthusiasm for free 
markets to solve any number of perceived ills in british society a 
summary issued by the lord chancellor said the market in legal 
services should be allowed to operate freely so as to give clients 
the widest possible choice of costeffective services 
in addition to changing the roles of solicitors and barristers 
lord mackay proposed 
adopting a contingency fee system with fees based on the 
lawyers costs not on a percentage of the judgment as in the united 
states 
creating a legal services ombudsman with broad powers to 
investigate complaints and order compensation 
permitting multidisciplinary practices which might include 
barristers solicitors accountants surveyors and estate agents 
realtors 
fennell who is a senior barrister said the new proposals struck 
at the root of everyones right to be represented in court by an 
independent advocate free of state control 
he predicted the bar would wither away with the development 
of big battalion law firms that would lure away the most skilled 
advocates 
ultimately fennell said the governments involvement in 
licensing would give it the power to silence lawyers who take up 
unpopular causes 
gaskell however said the bars continued existence would depend 
strictly on quality of service i dont believe for a moment that 
the independent bar will wither and die he said 
anticipating fears that contingency fees might lead to ballooning 
caseloads and damage awards lord mackay noted that damages in 
english courts are set by judges not juries 
he also proposed retaining a rule that requires losing plaintiffs 
to pay defendants legal costs 
desmond wilson chairman of the citizen action compensation 
campaign said the crucial question is whether the government is 
committed to expanding legal aid there are thousands of people 
who are caught in the middleincome trap deemed to be too affluent 
to qualify for legal aid but who are not rich enough to even 
contemplate taking legal proceedings

they see one and they arent afraid to do things a little 
differently 
so it was that mayor robert walker and two city aldermen managed 
to grab a new police precinct station for just 1 this week before 
it rolled out of town

head librarians at mount holyoke 
college tend to have long tenures but anne edmonds is retiring 
after only a quarter century on the job a little short of the 
average 
edmonds 64 is only the fourth head librarian at the womens 
college since mary olivia nutting took the job 119 years ago she 
said she plans to retire when the librarys addition is complete in 
about two years 
the average tenure of edmonds three predecessors was 313 years 
nutting who kept the job for 31 years was followed by bertha e 
blakely who served 35 years even after her retirement blakely 
came in every day for 25 years to build the colleges extensive 
archives edmonds said 
next came flora belle ludington who held the post 28 years 
before edmonds took over in 1964 
edmonds attributed the long terms of her predecessors to the fact 
that library administration was a mans field until recently and was 
hard for a woman to move around in that trend has since reversed

president bushs embattled nominee as health 
secretary won support from a cadre of conservative antiabortion 
senators after telling them he backs the presidents position to 
reverse the supreme court decision legalizing abortion 
louis w sullivans meeting wednesday with the conservative 
senators followed reports by others on capitol hill that he had 
voiced support for the 1973 roe vs wade decision 
sen gordon humphrey rnh said sullivan convinced him 
otherwise humphrey said that on the basis of this meeting he 
had no reservations about sullivan to head the department of health 
and human services 
sullivan also received a renewed vote of support from the 
president 
he has supported my position 100 percent bush said wednesday 
in an interview with newspaper reporters adding the chances were 
none that he would withdraw the nomination 
ive not heard anyone suggesting that he will not be 
confirmed bush said 
the dispute underscored the dilemma of senate republicans who do 
not want anyone at hhs with views other than their own on the 
abortion issue but who hesitate to oppose confirmation of bushs 
only black cabinet nominee 
it would be an embarrassment to the president an embarrassment 
to the republican party if the nomination encountered any trouble 
and we dont want that humphrey had said on tuesday 
in a bid to placate the antiabortionists white house chief of 
staff john sununu said wednesday that sullivan had suggested 
constance horner a former regan administration personnel director 
whose antiabortion views are well known as his chief deputy at hhs 
humphrey said he was satisfied that the new secretary be 
surrounded by aides who would actively support the president on 
abortion 
the issue of sullivans abortion views resurfaced earlier this 
week after sen bob packwood of oregon a prochoice republican 
said that in a recent meeting sullivan had expressed his personal 
support for roe vs wade 
as recently as monday when thousands of antiabortion protestors 
marched to mark the 16th anniversary of the high courts decision 
bush reaffirmed his opposition to abortion and called for the 
decisions reversal 
sullivan himself has said little publicly 
once the hearings go forward everything will be cleared he 
said wednesday after meeting with senators including abortion 
opponents jesse helms of north carolina orrin hatch of utah james 
mcclure of idaho and william armstrong of colorado 
also attending was a conservative who has taken a prochoice 
position for many years sen alan simpson rwyo who agreed 
with the others that sullivan had expressed opposition to roe vs 
wade 
he said the nominee not only feels that as a designee of george 
bush but as a person 
simpson said sullivan would spell out his position in a written 
statement that would be made public 
he never quite knew what was waiting for him here said 
simpson he was trying to maybe like a doctor would explain his 
diagnosis

atlanta police recruiters are beating the 
bushes in the deep south offering pay hikes of up to 8000 just to 
keep officers on the streets of one of the nations fastest growing 
cities 
the department has tried to hire 200 officers for each of the 
last two years last year it was able to come up with only 119 
candidates and the recruiters are blaming competition with 
neighboring counties which are growing along with atlanta 
youve got to realize weve got 17 counties to compete 
against recruiter re gordon said during a weeklong stop here 
a lot of the growth is in the suburbs and they need employees 
too 
a new precinct planned to open this year and an annual attrition 
rate of about 140 officers has the atlanta police department 
scrambling to find recruits last february five recruiters from the 
1400officer department began making outofstate trips to find new 
officers 
we pick our destination cities based on population schools and 
the economy theres no sense going to coral gables florida where 
they pay officers 35000 a year and were offering 22000 
recruiter mh gray said a lot of people in cities like jackson 
start at minimum wage or 450 and its hard to make a living or 
have anything 
the jackson police department pays just over 14000 a year to 
firstyear police officers who must have at least two years of 
college compared with 21392 for firstyear atlanta officers who 
do not need a degree officers with two years of college receive 
22237 to start in atlanta recruiters said 
the recruiters said they do not actively seek out local police 
officers but will test any applicant interested 
gordon said the majority of atlanta recruits do not come from 
police departments in the cities they visit 
last year recruiters visited 19 cities including fayetteville 
nc columbia sc louisville ky and nashville tenn gordon 
said nine trips are planned this year the recruiters said 
gordon said 141 people had picked up applications by wednesday 
morning about 75 were expected to be tested today with 30 
eventually hired from jackson gordon said 
one applicant said wednesday he has been trying to find a job 
with various law enforcement agencies in mississippi for the past 
eight months 
mississippi just doesnt have the funds available said kevin 
iosty 21 an electrician who traveled about 85 miles from laurel to 
apply this is a career ive been wanting to pursue for a long 
time and mississippi just doesnt have the opportunities

for the first time since they hit record 
stores compact discs outsold vinyl longplaying records the first 
six months of last year joining the cassette in threatening to 
render the lp obsolete 
manufacturer shipments of cds soared 64 percent to 704 million 
units in the first six months of 1988 up from 43 million units in 
the first half of 1987 the recording industry association of 
america said wednesday 
lp deliveries on the other hand declined 224 percent to 435 
million units from the 56 million shipped in 1987s first six 
months the association said 
music lovers spent 1 billion for cds which are more expensive 
than lps in the first six months of 1988 a nearly 50 percent gain 
in dollar sales over the same period in 1987 
when cds were introduced in 1983 they accounted for just 172 
million in sales the riaa said 
the figures which take into account unsold lps and cds returned 
to manufacturers show that cassette shipments improved 11 percent 
to 2081 million units in the january to june period last year 
compared with 188 million in the first half of 1987 
for all of 1987 cd deliveries rose a whopping 93 percent over 
1986 to 1021 million units and cassettes improved 19 percent to 
410 million units lps meanwhile declined 15 percent to 107 
million units in 1987 
the demise of the vinyl lp has been predicted for some time but 
patricia heimers an riaa spokeswomen said it was premature to say 
the longplay album was going the way of the 78 rpm record and 
eighttrack cassettes 
i think that the lp will be around for a good long while she 
said in a telephone interview wednesday weve seen over the past 
few years a shifting in the configuration of choice 
there are an awful lot of lp lovers out there each 
configuration serves different needs for different consumers

president raul alfonsin has 
created a national security council that includes the three military 
chiefs of staff giving the rightist armed forces a voice in 
argentine internal security 
the action late wednesday came in response to a guerrilla assault 
on a suburban army base that left 36 people dead most of them 
leftist extremists authorities said in his decree alfonsin said 
he formed the council to advise him on antisubversive action 
in addition to the army air force and navy chiefs it includes 
the defense interior and foreign relations ministers the state 
intelligence chief a secretary to be designated by the president 
and alfonsin 
the president may add other members to the council at his 
discretion 
the rightist military has long pressed for a role in determining 
internal security policy but alfonsin had refused under pressure 
from human rights groups and the political left which fears a 
resurgence of antileftist repression 
the government says at least 8900 suspected subversives vanished 
without a trace in the 1970s during the militarys dirty war 
campaign to rid the country of leftists human rights groups say up 
to 30000 people actually were abducted and are presumed to have 
been killed by security forces 
since alfonsin was elected president 5 years ago military 
tensions have been on the rise especially since april 1987 
alfonsin has faced three uprisings in the last 21 months by 
rightwing elements in the army infuriated by the human rights 
trials of military officials accused of atrocities during the armed 
forces 197683 rule 
the decree said mondays attack on the 3rd infantry regiments 
base the first leftist guerrilla action in more than a decade made 
necessary the taking of decisions conducive to efficiently 
preventing controlling and stifling a repetition of these events 
a heavily armed group assaulted the infantry base in suburban la 
tablada and it was retaken after a 27hour siege by army and police 
forces backed by tanks helicopter gunships and artillery 
seven soldiers one policeman and 28 guerrillas were killed 
another 68 people were wounded and 19 guerrillas were captured 
authorities said 
also wednesday attorney general andres dalessio said 
investigations revealed the dead included jorge caldu a member of 
the defunct peoples revolutionary army known by its spanish 
initials erp 
the erp a marxist guerrilla group active in the 1970s was 
virtually wiped out in a harsh antisubversion campaign after the 
military seized power in 1976 
another victim was manuel banos a leader of the movement 
everyone for the country a small leftist organization known to 
include former erp militants another leader of the movement juan 
burgos was among those captured 
the guerrillas were believed to be seeking to attract popular 
support by staging a raid on the regiment thus showing their 
militant opposition to rightwing elements in the armed forces 
the group called itself the popular resistance front

sen george mitchell used his inaugural address 
as senate majority leader to offer president bush true 
bipartisanship on foreign policy while pushing a distinctly 
democratic agenda on domestic issues 
the maine democrats proposals include boosting the minimum wage 
improving the lot of the homeless assuring day care for the 
children of workers and investing in education housing and 
improving the environment 
mitchell said that while bush recognized many of these needs in 
his presidential inaugural address last friday he has yet to tell 
us how he proposes to meet them 
on the senates first working day of the 101st congress 
mitchell senate republican leader bob dole of kansas and other 
senators jammed the legislative hopper with some 300 bills some 
retreads from the past some representing new initiatives 
the senate also unanimously confirmed the first of president 
bushs cabinet choices all by identical 990 roll call votes only 
sen don nickles rokla was not present to vote 
the first three confirmed members of the bush cabinet are 
secretary of state james a baker iii secretary of labor elizabeth 
hanford dole and budget director richard darman 
mitchell presented a democratic view of the nations problems in 
a carefully tailored response to bushs inaugural address strongly 
endorsing its appeal to end bickering and restore bipartisanship in 
foreign policy 
in his inaugural address the president put his hand out to me 
and to the speaker of the house mitchell said i now extend 
mine to him 
we are here to make a new start mitchell said a central 
aim of that new start for me is to pledge to president bush that i 
will do my utmost to foster true bipartisanship 
but promises and good intentions will not make bipartisanship a 
fact mitchell said 
it requires deeds to match words action to carry out 
intention he said bipartisanship grows from shared 
responsibility 
mitchell added however that serious consultation between the 
white house and capitol hill will not prevent differences between 
the congress and the president 
there have always been such differences he said there 
always will be 
he made clear that for the two parties to come together in a 
cooperative foreign policy ways must be found to end the festering 
feud over the war powers act the act is intended to compel a 
president to withdraw us forces from potentially hostile 
situations if congress objects to their presence 
congressional supporters of the act defend it as protecting the 
constitutional right of congress to declare war but former 
president reagan and other chief executives have called for its 
repeal as an unconstitutional encroachment on a presidents power as 
commander in chief of the armed forces 
i believe a constitutionally sound compromise is possible and i 
shall work for it mitchell said 
dole also pledged bipartisanship but at the same time he said it 
is the aim of senate republicans to support and further the cause 
of our new republican president 
the confirmation process got into full gear with the senate votes 
confirming baker darman and mrs dole and the opening of 
confirmation hearings for defense secretarydesignate john tower and 
several other cabinet nominees 
one nominee apparently defused controversy over his views 
louis sullivan named by president bushs to head the department 
of health and human services met privately with antiabortion 
senators and apparently convinced them his views are close enough to 
theirs to merit their support 
dr sullivan believes in his heart that the roe vs wade 
decision should be overturned said sen gordon humphrey rnh 
referring to the 1973 supreme court ruling that legalized abortion 
sullivan head of the morehouse college medical school had upset 
many conservative legislators when he was quoted by a senator as 
saying he did not favor overturning the ruling 
the speeches by dole and mitchell were followed by a rush to 
introduce the first legislation of the year 
the hundreds of bills ranged from a measure to block or repeal 
the proposed 45000 pay raise for lawmakers to doles proposal for 
a balanced budget amendment to the constitution 
the very first bill s1 the integrity in post employment act 
would restrict members of congress and congressional staff as well 
as members of the executive branch from lobbying for specified 
periods after leaving government service 
mitchell told reporters he favors a pay raise as part of the 
ethics package as long as senators no longer are permitted to 
accept fees for giving speeches and making personal appearances 
the proposed pay raise has become the most controversial issue of 
the new congress 
the goal of opponents is to block attempts by house speaker jim 
wright to permit the pay raise to take effect automatically in two 
weeks by preventing a vote to forbid it 
lawmakers salaries are scheduled to rise on feb 8 from just 
over 89500 to 135000 an increase of 50 percent federal judges 
and some political appointees would also see their salaries boosted

on a warm spring night in 1974 ted bundy waited 
for his next victim in an alley behind a row of sorority and 
fraternity houses clutching a briefcase and with crutches tucked 
under his arms 
university of washingtons greek row was his stage and his props 
were in place the crutches to signify a disabled leg the briefcase 
that was hard to carry a few blocks away his brown volkswagen bug 
waited in a parking lot behind its rear wheels were handcuffs and a 
crowbar 
bundy who could be a poised and charming man was all 
anticipation as 18yearold georgann hawkins happened along she was 
just completing her first college year that june 11 and was headed 
down the welllit alley for her sorority house 
i was moving up the alley using a briefcase and some crutches 
and the young woman walked down bundy said on the tape played 
wednesday by robert keppel a state attorney generals investigator 
the tape was made friday the day bundy confessed to the eight 
1974 ted killings in western washington bundy 42 was executed 
tuesday morning in florida for the 1978 rape and murder of a 
12yearold girl 
five ted victims had been slain by the time bundy encountered 
ms hawkins 
on the tape bundy said ms hawkins paused for a moment then 
kept on walking down the alley toward me 
at midblock the two came together and the handsome bundy must 
have known what to say i asked her to help me carry the 
briefcase which she did and we walked back up the alley toward 
his car he said in a matteroffact manner whispering in spots 
when we reached the car i knocked her unconscious with the 
crowbar there were some handcuffs there along with the 
crowbar i handcuffed her and put her in the passengers side of 
the car and drove away 
she was unconscious but she was very much alive 
bundy said he drove to issaquah 15 miles east of seattle 
in the tape filled with pauses and sighs bundy quickly 
summarized the rest of the trip past issaquah and up the hill 
down the road to a grassy area 
i took her out of the car and took the handcuffs off her 
and 
the easytalking bundy who keppel said had a habit of talking 
fast when he was slipping away from the truth had a hard time 
getting the words out on what then happened to ms hawkins 
gee this is probably the hardest part i dont know pause 
i dont know its all getting sort of abs um not abstract 
would be poor but um well were getting into some were getting 
right down to it and uh well well talk about it its just you 
know you understand its not something that i find easy to talk 
about and after all this time pause deep sigh 
at this point in the news conference keppel stopped the tape 
out of respect he said for the victims family 
its bad thats about all i can say he said of bundys 
continuing description of ms hawkins murder 
keppel has offered to describe to the families of victims the 
treatment to which they were subjected so far he said he has had 
no takers 
keppel said bundy did say later in the tape intertwined with 
gruesome details that he had returned to near the university of 
washington the day after ms hawkins abduction to recover her shoe 
and shattered earrings 
he rode over on his bicycle and found them near where he had 
parked his volkswagen even while police were inspecting the alley a

the honduran military vowed 
retribution for the assassination of former armed forces chief gen 
gustavo adolfo alvarez martinez the father of the nicaraguan contra 
rebel movement 
officials said alvarez the founder of the usbacked 
antisandinista movement in honduras was slain wednesday when six 
gunmen riddled the car he was sitting in outside his home in the 
capitals florencia district 
the armed forces said wednesday that alvarez 56 had been 
vilely assassinated and it deeply mourned the tragic death 
in a news release it energetically condemned the extremist 
forces that try to fill our country with blood and terror and 
promised to act according to the law against those who violate the 
norms of the law and human dignity trying to upset tranquility and 
the democratic stability of our nation 
radio america a local station said anonymous callers claimed 
responsibility on behalf of the popular liberation forces a leftist 
extremist group police said they had no evidence to confirm the 
claim 
it was the third assassination in honduras in three weeks 
previously killed were a nicaraguan rebel commander and a reputed 
druglords lawyer 
as head of the national police in 1981 alvarez became the 
godfather of the contra rebels by telling the late cia director 
william casey forces opposed to nicaraguas ruling leftist 
sandinistas could operate from honduran territory 
police said the driver of the former military chiefs car also 
was killed in wednesday mornings shooting and alvarezs soninlaw 
was wounded 
alvarez was chief of the armed forces from 1982 to 1984 under 
president roberto suazo cordova and frequently denounced the 
sandinistas 
trained in the united states and argentina he was once 
considered the most powerful figure in honduras 
alvarez also presided over the beginning of joint ushonduran 
military exercises in honduras that were designed to intimidate the 
rulers of neighboring nicaragua 
the contras alvarez once pledged would wage a war without 
quarter against international communism which has now taken over 
nicaragua 
under his original proposal to casey described in the book 
banana diplomacy by journalist roy gutman alvarez proposed 
using the rebels to provoke a border incident with the sandinistas 
in nicaragua honduras then would ask the united states for 
assistance permitting us intervention 
alvarez also supervised a counterinsurgency campaign against 
suspected honduran guerrillas that us officials privately viewed 
as a success 
human rights activists charged that the campaign relied on 
militarylinked death squads and at least 100 people disappeared or 
were jailed illegally honduran forces deny the charges 
honduran officials have kept a low profile on the contras and 
officially denied their presence on honduran territory even when 
thousands operated from border camps 
alvarezs denunciations of the sandinistas brought embarrassing 
attention to the us role in honduras and honduran support for the 
contras 
in a 1982 interview he denied he took orders from john dimitri 
negroponte the former us ambassador to honduras no gringo 
gives us orders no foreigner we are not going to be a vassal or a 
puppet of the united states military officers led by thengen 
walter lopez reyes ousted alvarez in 1984 and he sought exile in 
miami after receiving a dishonorable discharge 
us officials said in 1984 that suazo cordova ousted alvarez 
because he meddled in politics most honduran political and military 
sources said the honduran military command orchestrated the ouster 
because he did not consult them on vital decisions 
about 12000 contra fighters now are believed to be in honduran

soviet diplomats will soon get 
negotiating tips from a harvard professor in an unprecedented 
workshop focusing on clearer communications between the superpowers 
i dont want to dance a minuet if theyre doing the polka 
said the professor roger fisher its not that theres one right 
way to negotiate but we can learn from each other 
the soviet ministry of foreign affairs on wednesday formally 
agreed to hold the fiveday workshop at its diplomatic academy in 
moscow in late march 
its the first time in soviet history that we have invited 
american scholars to come over to russia and lecture students at a 
diplomatic academy said victor issraelyan a ministry official 
who holds ambassadorial rank 
i think in our time in the new nuclear age negotiations are 
becoming more and more important issraelyan said there is no 
alternative 
the workshop which harvard proposed last fall will be conducted 
by fisher a law professor with harvards negotiation project and 
soviet experts 
about two dozen soviet diplomats will participate fisher said 
he said the differences between the united states and soviet 
union are key reasons for making sure both sides are negotiating 
within the same framework 
the workshop isnt intended to teach soviets an american style of 
negotiating or to minimize differences between the two countries 
fisher said 
there are real differences of perception he said instead 
of arguing whos right we want to be working out the best way of 
dealing with things 
fisher coauthor of getting together building a relationship 
that gets to yes said the problem with traditional negotiations 
is that both sides start from firm positions meaning any change 
involves concessions he said better negotiations begin with both 
sides discussing general guidelines rather than specific commitments 
for example instead of discussing the rights and wrongs of the 
strategic defense initiative or star wars negotiating teams 
could accept that research is inevitable while deployment is not 
immediately likely and could work out guidelines for research 
fisher said 
i think for years negotiators have often seen themselves as 
soldiers in a cause doing battle on behalf of their country he 
said our perception is that diplomats should rather see 
themselves as a cadre of professionals skilled at dealing with the 
genuine differences between their governments 
the us state department is aware of the workshop but not 
directly involved fisher said 
he said the negotiation project is exploring the possibility of 
conducting a similar workshop in washington

the soviet unions budget deficit is three times 
what the kremlin projected three months ago and must be quickly 
lowered if chronic shortages of consumer goods are to end a senior 
economist says 
leonid abalkin director of the economics institute of the 
academy of sciences told a news conference wednesday that the 
deficit ruins the national economy 
he said the 162 billion budget shortfall could be eliminated in 
two to three years if the state stops funding more moneylosing 
enterprises and the military devotes more of its resources to the 
civilian sector 
without a solution to this problem we wont be able to solve 
the problem of consumer goods shortages abalkin said 
president mikhail s gorbachev has called improving supplies of 
food and consumer goods for the countrys 285 million people a top 
priority in his program of perestroika or restructuring the economy 
in october soviet officials said the budget had been running in 
the red for years and projected a deficit of 55 billion on a budget 
of 795 billion 
this month economist ot bogomolov wrote that the deficit 
actually could reach 162 billion this year and abalkin agreed with 
that estimate 
he said the april 1986 explosion and fire at the chernobyl 
nuclear power plant and earthquakes in armenia last month and in 
tadzhikistan this month had contributed to the deficit 
he said world economic conditions such as the falling price of 
oil the soviet unions main export were also to blame 
the soviet union itself could be criticized because its unwise 
export structure is very vulnerable to fluctuations in the 
price of oil abalkin said 
he said some production targets in the fiveyear plan that runs 
through 1990 should be scrapped and 32 billion could be saved by 
closing bad businesses and calling off expensive construction 
projects and other huge outlays 
the state should stop financing businesses that wont turn a 
profit for years and instead focus on enterprises that can make 
quick profits he said the government reported last week that one 
in 10 enterprises lost money in 1988 
other help could come from the military instead of building new 
factories plants producing goods for the military could turn their 
readymade resources and skilled workforce to civilian use he said 
gorbachev said this month that the military budget will be 
trimmed by 142 percent and the production of arms and military 
supplies by 195 percent 
the state traditionally has all but ignored the market forces of 
supply and demand wasting money on unprofitable factories that 
produce goods no one wants and giving short shrift to some highly 
sought items it also set prices artificially low on basics such as 
housing meat bread and cabbage 
last year the soviet union began an effort to change that by 
ordering businesses that cannot pay their own way to close but 
abalkin said no businesses have gone bankrupt 
in some cases when closing was imminent workers formed a 
private business to run the operation as a cooperative he said

china announced today that soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze will visit beijing next week setting the stage 
for the first sinosoviet summit in 30 years 
foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing said shevardnadze will be 
in beijing for three days beginning feb 2 renewing talks with his 
chinese counterpart on normalizing relations marred by three decades 
of hostility and mistrust 
qian qichen held talks with kremlin leaders in moscow in 
december the first chinese foreign minister to do so in 32 years 
if next months talks go well the two foreign ministers may set 
a date for the first sinosoviet summit since nikita khrushschev met 
mao tsetung in beijing in 1959 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has repeatedly expressed 
his eagerness to improve ties with china and is widely expected to 
travel to beijing in april or may 
gorbachevs meeting with 84yearold senior chinese leader deng 
xiaoping would formally normalize ties strained since the two 
countries split over ideological differences in 1960 and fought a 
short border war in 1969 
li said shevardnadze and qian will prepare for a summit meeting 
between top leaders of china and the soviet union the two sides 
will also exchange opinions on other matters of common interest 
chinese leaders will meet with shevardnadze 
he said the qianshevardnadze talks will take up what china says 
is the main obstacle to better sinosoviet ties the conflict in 
cambodia 
china backs the antivietnamese resistance in cambodia the 
soviet union backs vietnams 10year occupation of the wartorn 
country 
both powers agree that a withdrawal of vietnamese troops is the 
key to a political settlement 
however differences remain on the composition of a coalition 
government to be formed by the hanoibacked forces in phnom penh 
the cambodian capital and the threeparty resistance including the 
khmer rouge 
china has welcomed a recent vietnamese proposal to remove all its 
troops in cambodia by september and says it will reduce military aid 
to the resistance in conjunction with the pullout 
marked progress also has been made in resolving the other two 
issues china sees as obstacles to normal relations with moscow 
afghanistan and border tensions 
soviet troops are reportedly leaving afghanistan in the final 
stage of a military pullout to be completed by feb 15 gorbachev 
also announced last week that soviet troop strength in asia will be 
reduced by 200000 
most soviet troops in asia are located near the sinochinese 
border or in soviet ally mongolia and are regarded by china as a 
direct threat to its security 
normalization of political ties will not bring dramatic changes 
to overall ties which have been steadily improving during the 1980s 
trade between the powers in 1988 has been estimated at about 28 
billion up 30 percent from the previous year and barter along the 
highly militarized 5000mile border is booming 
cultural and academic exchanges are increasing the official 
xinhua news agency said today that 600 chinese scholars will go to 
the soviet union this year and 320 soviets will study at chinese 
universities in 1983 when academic contacts were renewed only 10 
scholars were exchanged 
the two sides also are discussing joint ventures and soviet 
technological help to modernize factories set up by the soviets in 
the 1950s and then abandoned when relations deteriorated 
china has emphasized it will never return to the political 
relationship of the 1950s when the fledgling chinese communist 
state followed the soviet lead in setting international policy

cambodian resistance leader prince norodom 
sihanouk today canceled a trip to indonesia for peace talks because 
the vietnamesebacked government in his homeland has rejected his 
peace proposal 
sihanouk who leads a coalition fighting vietnams 10year 
occupation of cambodia said in a statement that it is absolutely 
useless for me to be in jakarta for next months talks 
the prince also said he would not go to paris for a meeting of 
the three resistance factions and the vietnambacked phnom penh 
government next spring and called off a meeting in bangkok with thai 
foreign minister siddhi savetsila at the end of february 
vietnam laos the warring parties of cambodia and the members of 
the noncommunist association of southeast asian nations were to 
meet in jakarta from feb 19 to 22 for the second session of 
multilateral peace talks the first meeting was held last july 
the association includes thailand indonesia singapore 
malaysia the philippines and brunei 
sihanouk who arrived in beijing on tuesday said the recent 
rejection of his fivepoint peace plan for cambodia sparked his 
decision 
a day earlier the mercurial leader said he would go to jakarta 
but would not take part in the talks 
in his plan sihanouk proposed that an international peacekeeping 
force supervise vietnams withdrawal 
hun sen the hanoibacked prime minister of cambodia has 
rejected the plan because he claims it would facilitate the return 
to power in cambodia of the khmer rouge the most powerful of the 
three resistance groups 
the khmer rouge led cambodia from 1975 to late 1978 and were 
responsible for at least 1 million deaths during a bloody rule 
vietnams invasion in dec 1978 replaced the probeijing khmer rouge 
with a prohanoi regime 
china attacked vietnam in 1979 to punish it for the cambodian 
invasion but in a sign of progress on the cambodian issue the two 
countries last week held their first highlevel meeting in a decade 
during the talks vietnam agreed in principle to withdraw its 
troops from cambodia by september assuming a political solution can 
be reached hanoi also agreed that an international group could 
supervise the withdrawal but its makeup has yet to be determined 
china for its part agreed to slow its aid to the cambodian 
resistance coalition as vietnam withdraws its troops 
the agreement in principle does not represent a change in 
position by either country both had issued public statements before 
the meeting spelling out their positions 
on tuesday sihanouk said he opposed the linking of an end to 
material aid to the resistance and the withdrawal of vietnamese 
troops he also said he was pessimistic about an easy solution to 
the conflict 
sihanouk said progress has been made on solving the international 
aspects of the conflict but a deadlock remains regarding the 
makeup of a future cambodian government 
in bangkok thai prime minister chatichai choonhavan today urged 
all cambodian guerrilla factions to attend the peace talks in 
indonesia 
the cambodian parties must face one another its pointless for 
them to fight and kill one another chatichai told reporters after 
two days of talks with hun sen

patrick purdy was on nothing stronger 
than coffee and cigarettes when he opened fire with an ak47 outside 
an elementary school killing five children before committing 
suicide authorities said 
toxicology reports performed on the body of the 24yearold 
drifter have revealed only a trace of nicotine and caffeine 
stockton police capt dennis perry said 
a cigarette and a cup of coffee perry said that may be 
it 
police and relatives have said purdy had a history of drug use 
and he was arrested several times on drugrelated charges 
meanwhile investigators probing the stillunexplained massacre 
in which 29 other students and a teacher were wounded agreed to 
look into whether purdy had links to white supremacists the slain 
pupils were children of southeast asian refugees 
state attorney general john van de kamp ordered the background 
probe at the urging of groups led by the asian community in the san 
francisco bay area kati corsaut a spokeswoman for the department 
of justice said wednesday 
what happened is that the attorney generals office received 
inquiries from various groups concerned that the crime was related 
to a hate crime and that he purdy had racist affiliations 
armed with a sovietstyle ak47 semiautomatic rifle purdy 
sprayed the cleveland elementary school with more than 100 rounds 
nine of the wounded children were still in stockton area hospitals 
more than eight days after the jan 17 killings 
stockton police have said there was no apparent racial motive in 
the attack even though more than 70 percent of the pupils at the 
school are asian purdy described by relatives and acquaintances as 
a troubled youth with a criminal history had attended the school as 
a child 
investigators said however that purdys anger seemed unfocused 
cutting across racial lines and changing targets daily 
through his lifetime mr purdy developed a hate for 
everybody said perry 
before he went on his rampage purdy donned an olivedrab tshirt 
with slogans and words including libya and plo and death 
to the great satin apparently his spelling for satan carved on 
the stock of his rifle was the word hezbollah the name of the

not elaborate

a study of an irish tomb built about three 
centuries before stonehenge provides new evidence that it is the 
oldest known structure with an astronomical function says a study 
published today 
the 5000yearold tomb was apparently designed to create a 
dramatic light show that began at sunrise on the shortest day of the 
year probably for religious purposes the study said 
previous research also suggested an astronomical connection 
but this study is the first to investigate implications of the 
fact that the sun rose in a different spot on the horizon when the 
tomb was built than it does today said astronomer tom ray of the 
dublin institute for advanced studies in ireland whose results are 
published in the british journal nature 
the newgrange tomb north of dublin was built around 5100 years 
ago the first stage of stonehenge located on salisbury plains 
england dates back about 4800 years 
the tomb is among the oldest of massive stone monuments found in 
northwestern europe and the british isles said archaeologist curtis 
runnels of boston university rays study gives the strongest 
evidence to date that even the early monuments were designed with 
astronomical influence runnels said 
edwin krupp director of the griffith observatory in los angeles 
and a researcher in ancient astronomy said he believed previous 
studies already had established an astronomical role in the tombs 
design but the new work improves the case he said 
krupp agreed that the irish tomb is the oldest known monument 
with firm evidence for astronomical design but runnels said that 
because of uncertainties in dating some egyptian buildings may be 
as old 
the newgrange tomb lies within a mound of loose stones about 90 
yards wide and 35 feet tall a corridor snakes about 60 feet into 
the mound leading to a chamber with a domeshaped roof 
ray said the light show began with sunrise on the winter solstice 
the first rays of light shot down the center of the corridor and 
struck the floor in the chamber creating a lighted spot a few feet 
long and a couple inches wide ray said the reflection lit a 
carving that features a trio of spirals 
the sunlight entered above the tombs entrance through a gap 
measuring about 8 inches tall and 3 feet wide ray said as seen 
from the chamber the sun would appear in the lower left hand corner 
of the gap continue rising until it was framed by the gap and then 
exit at the upper right corner he said 
the gap was created such that when it framed the sun it matched 
the suns width vertically within an accuracy of onefifth or 
onesixth of the suns radius which is not bad for 5000 years 
ago ray said 
scientists can only gather circumstantial evidence to determine 
the intentions of the newgrange builders krupp said because you 
dont have the owners manual 
the calculation that the first rays of the sun reached the back 
chamber by going down the middle of the corridor gives a certain 
kind of symmetric satisfaction although really we dont know if 
that was the target or what the detailed meaning of that event might 
have been krupp said 
but to our eyes that looks like a very satisfying place to put 
a beam of light if youre into dramatic light and shadow effects 
runnels said archaeologists suspect the tomb was a burial 
chamber built by an agricultural society that had not yet 
discovered metal for tools 
the society was apparently complex enough to plan and build the 
elaborate tomb with a specialist leisure class to make astronomical 
observations and direct the engineering he said

its now an eye for an eye and a tooth for 
309000 according to a survey taken for rootcanal specialists who 
wanted to know how much monetary value americans place on their 
front teeth 
the survey taken last month for the american association of 
endodontists asked 1023 men and women to name the smallest amount 
of money they would accept for one of their healthy front teeth 
dr joseph d maggio president of the association said almost a 
quarter of those surveyed refused to specify how much saying they 
would not sell such a tooth for any amount of money 
the average amount cited by respondents who said they would take 
money was 309000 maggio said wednesday night 
this survey tells us that people understand the importance of a 
tooth to their health and quality of life said maggio an 
endodonist from oak brook a tooth is like a computer chip its 
small and the materials that make it up are worth only pennies but 
thats far exceeded by its functional value 
maggio estimated the chemical value of an averagesized front 
tooth at about 12 cents 
maggio said the survey specified healthy front teeth because 
those are the ones most people would be least willing to part with 
obviously we wouldnt have gotten the same results if we had 
asked about wisdom teeth he said 
maggio noted that the survey conducted by the opinion research 
corp of princeton nj found that older respondents were much 
less willing to sell a tooth 
among respondents at least 65 years old 42 percent said they 
would accept no amount of money for a front tooth a similar 
response came from only 13 percent of those between ages 18 and 34 
it could be that older people already have suffered some tooth 
loss and know first hand that nothing can really replace a natural 
tooth maggio suggested 
as an endodontist maggio believes that everything possible 
should be done to save an existing tooth rather than pulling it and 
replacing it 
he estimates that more than 22 million root canal procedures in 
which the tooth is saved by removing the nerve were performed in 
the united states last year compared with some 40 million tooth 
extractions 
in most parts of the country a root canal can save an existing 
tooth for between 275 and 700 depending on the type of tooth and 
the severity of decay he said an extraction if the missing 
tooth is replaced with a bridge or a partial usually winds up being 
more expensive 
maggio said there are 2900 endodontists in the nation and their 
work was only recognized as a speciality by the american dental 
association in the 1960s even though root canal work had been 
performed for many years before that

a study of temperature and precipitation data 
collected over nearly a century shows the united states has not 
become any hotter drier colder or wetter scientists say 
the study of data collected by weather stations across the 
country from 1895 to 1987 concluded that while the nation has 
experienced periods of unusual temperature and precipitation there 
has been no trend in one direction or another 
the study published in the current issue of geophysical research 
letters does not support the rising notion that there have been 
major climatic changes in this country researcher george maul of 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration said here 
wednesday night 
the findings dont necessarily cast doubt on previous findings of 
a worldwide warming trend and have no bearing on the 
greenhouseeffect theory that a buildup of carbon dioxide and 
pollutants is acting like a greenhouse and causing such warming 
lead researcher kirby hanson said in interviews with the new york 
times and the los angeles times 
hanson a meteorologist pointed out that the united states 
occupies only a small percentage of the earths surface and said 
the new findings may be the result of regional variations 
last july james hansen of the national aviation and space 
administrations goddard institute startled members of congress when 
he testified that unusually hot conditions such as last summers 
drought and rash of wildfires could be forerunners of the 
greenhouse effect 
hansen said temperatures had risen nearly 1 degree worldwide 
during the last century 
he said wednesday that he had no quarrel with the new studys 
findings 
we are just arguing now about whether the global warming effect 
is large enough to see hanson said it is not surprising we are 
not seeing it in a region the 48 contiguous states that covers 
only 15 percent of the globe 
maul said the study indicates scientists need to be cautious in 
concluding whether the united states can detect a greenhouse effect

clyde ashley jr shoplifted two cans of 
sardines ate them in the store and then tried to steal money to pay 
for them for that the exconvict was sentenced to life in prison 
as a habitual offender 
on wednesday the mississippi supreme court ruled that the 
sentence handed down in 1986 was overly harsh ashley was properly 
convicted for his great sardine caper the court said in 
ordering the trial judge to reconsider the sentence 
as evidence of the seemingly undue harshness of the sentence 
justice james robertson noted that prosecutors had said they 
wouldnt oppose a lighter sentence in the case 
according to the court records ashley now 44 was paroled on 
dec 13 1985 after spending 23 years in prison on a series of 
burglaries and one attempted robbery each time under the influence 
of alcohol 
on jan 15 1986 ashley after being rebuffed in attempts to get 
money from 85yearold eva washington entered a small grocery store 
in osyka in pike county and was seen opening and eating two cans of 
sardines 
once more while drinking ashley rather pathetically and 
pitifully again ran afoul of the law said robertson writing for 
the high court 
according to court records when the owner of the store cornered 
ashley and asked for payment for the sardines ashely said he would 
go to his aunts house to get some money 
the owner went with ashley to see washington who was not 
actually his aunt the store owner waited outside and called police 
when ashley did not return police found ashley hiding in a closet 
inside the house 
ashley was convicted of burglary for breaking into the house the 
judge reviewing his criminal record determined that ashley was a 
habitual offender and issued the sentence of life without parole

moisture and waste acid reacted together to 
blow the lid off a 55gallon drum causing the second leak at an 
abandoned chemical plant in a week a federal environmental 
protection agency official said 
a small vapor cloud dispersed before epa officials could 
determine how wide an area it covered there were no reports of 
injury to anyone in or near the former artel chemical co plant 
epa onsite coordinator jerry saseen said officials wouldnt know 
until later today what chemical was stored in the drum that blew up 
wednesday at the superfund site epa officials said the drum was 
located in the same area of the plant where a jan 19 leak occurred 
last weeks accident was also caused by moisture reacting with a 
chemical stored in a 55gallon drum there was a similar leak last 
fall 
both saseen and nitro mayor don karnes blamed unusually warm 
weather for causing condensation inside the drums temperatures have 
been fluctuating from the 20s and 30s to the 50s and 60s during a 
january warm spell 
until we get more even temperatures we could have situations 
like this saseen said the situation is ripe that this can 
happen many many many times i believe we will be 
experiencing these things over and over until the warm weather is 
over 
saseen said the leak was neutralized with lime and soda ash he 
said an epa crew would remain at the scene overnight 
we have literally thousands of drums here its a very very 
fragile situation saseen said 
cleanup crews could begin moving more than 5000 drums of toxic 
and hazardous chemicals from the abandoned plant as early as 
midfebruary said epa official doug fox the plant was closed and 
turned over to the epa in june after the federal government declared 
it a public health hazard 
last weeks leak involved thionyl chloride a potentially 
poisonous chemical used in the manufacture of pesticides there were 
no injuries but a 19block area of nitro was sealed off and about 
2500 of the towns 8000 residents were confined to their homes for 
more than an hour 
karnes said he did not give an order confining residents to 
shelter in the latest incident the mayor who had expressed 
displeasure over a lengthy delay between last weeks leak and the 
time the epa notified nitro officials said the reaction to 
wednesdays leak was much faster 
nitro built in world war i to manufacture explosives lies along 
the kanawha river in an area known as chemical valley that is the 
site of more than two dozen chemical plants 
there have been several chemical leaks in the area during the 
past decade in 1985 135 people were hospitalized after methyl 
isocyanate leaked from a union carbide plant in institute the plant 
was similar to one in bhopal india that leaked the year before 
killing more than 2000 people

in a lawsuit filed by the american civil 
liberties union the ku klux klan contends that the city council 
violated its right to free speech by denying it an outlet on cable 
television 
the lawsuit filed in us district court on wednesday asks that 
american cablevision reestablish its public access channel so that 
the klan can broadcast a white supremicist program called klansas 
city 
the kansas city council eliminated the public access station in 
june rather than broadcast the missouri knights of the ku klux 
klans show in its place american cablevision established a 
community access channel over which it exercises editorial control 
the lawsuit says the councils decision was motivated by the 
desire to suppress the racialist viewpoint of the klan 
councilman john sharp said the city council welcomes the suit 
because it was our intention to set a precedent that could be 
followed by other cities throughout the nation the issue is whether 
the city has the right to require every cable television subscriber 
to subsidize the klans propaganda 
dick kurtenbach executive director for the local aclu chapter 
said his organization found the klans white supremacist ideology 
abhorrent and believed klan members should be prosecuted if they 
used a television show to incite violence or other criminal activity 
however he said our client here is the first amendment the 
klan is only the vehicle 
the aclu has represented the klan and other rightwing groups on 
numerous occasions in the past 
local governments typically require cable companies to have 
public access channels before granting them operating licenses the 
channels are designed to allow a public forum and are protected by 
federal law from editorial control 
the kansas city controversy began in august 1987 when the klan 
sought permission to use the public access channel to show race 
and reason a series produced by tom metzger a californian and 
klan organizer who founded the white aryan resistance movement 
american cablevison officials said shows on the public access 
channel must be produced locally and denied the request the klan 
then applied for permission to broadcast klansas city which the 
group would produce after being trained by cable company employees 
that led to the councils decision to abandon the channel 
the klan applied to broadcast klansas city on the new 
community access channel but the request was denied in august 
robert b niles president of american cablevision told moran in a 
letter that your proposal does not meet the needs of the channel

former president chun doohwan refused 
today to accept a writ to testify before a national assembly 
committee on the suppression of a 1980 uprising that left at least 
200 people dead 
chun in voluntary exile at an isolated buddhist temple said in 
a statement he takes responsibility for putting down the kwangju 
uprising but does not intend to appear before the panel 
investigating the matter 
i think i was in a position to take moral and political 
responsibility so i have no intention to avoid responsibility 
chun said 
former president choi kyuha who briefly held office before chun 
took power with military backing in 1980 also refused today to 
accept a writ to testify 
both former presidents said previously that as former heads of 
state they could not be compelled to testify president roh taewoo 
has backed chuns refusal to testify despite widespread criticism 
about 500 radical students from several seoul colleges clashed 
with riot police at dongguk university today to demand the arrest of 
roh and chun they hurled hundreds of firebombs and rocks at police 
surrounding the school 
arrest chun doohwan and overthrow roh taewoo students 
yelled 
no serious injuries or arrests were reported in the fighting 
the opposition is trying to use the kwangju incident and other 
legacies of the authoritarian chun regime to weaken its successor 
the nearly yearold roh government roh a former general and close 
ally of chun is still identified with the expresident in the eyes 
of many koreans 
writs were issued to the two expresidents as the special 
committee resumed its hearing today into the 1980 uprising in the 
southern city of kwangju the oppositioncontrolled national 
assembly has been investigating allegations of human rights abuses 
and corruption under chun 
by official count about 200 people were killed and more than 
1000 injured in the armys suppressiong of the uprising opposition 
groups claim the casualty toll was much higher and the uprising 
remains a highly charged issue 
chun was in control of the armed forces at the time and became 
president a few months later choi a former prime minister briefly 
served as a figurehead president 
in his statement chun said he would testify indirectly 
instead of appearing before the committee but gave no details chun 
had indicated he would answer questions in writing 
i spend time here looking back on the past with regrets and 
repentance and i wish i could have healed the scars of the kwangju 
incident while in office he said in his message from the temple 
on the west coast 
under korean law the parliamentary committee has the power to 
refer the case to the prosecution for legal action but the 
prosecution must decide whether to act 
if the former presidents are charged and convicted of contempt of 
parliament they could be sentenced to up to five years in prison 
chun is also being pressed to testify before another 
parliamentary committee investigating corruption and other misdeeds 
the former president has denied any personal wrongdoing but he 
surrendered 24 million and went into rural exile after apologizing 
to the nation in november about a dozen members of the 
expresidents family have been arrested or convicted on corruption 
charges

kent state university officials broke ground 
for a scaleddown memorial to the four students killed by ohio 
national guardsmen in 1970 despite a silent protest by students and 
donors who say the new design is inadequate 
the groundbreaking wednesday for the may 4 memorial followed 
unanimous approval by university trustees to build a 100000 
memorial on a campus hill near where guardsmen shot 13 students 
killing four on may 4 1970 
about 30 people stood in silence about 20 yards from speakers at 
the groundbreaking holding signs protesting plans for the memorial 
the trustees nov 15 agreed to reduce the cost of the memorial 
from 12 million to 100000 after a fundraising campaign netted 
only 40000 
i dont like the autocratic method by which decisions were 
made said glenn frank a geology professor at the university for 
32 years who recently retired 
frank said he was among donors who along with a group of 
students known as the may 4 task force hired attorneys to represent 
their concern that the original design not be altered 
they cant just use their money and build something else 
said attorney william whittaker of kent who with john lawson of 
cleveland represents the donors and students 
whittaker said they were prepared wednesday to ask portage county 
common pleas judge george martin to issue a temporary restraining 
order halting all work on the memorial 
however ksu attorneys agreed to contact all donors regarding the 
change in memorial plans before construction starts said lawson 
adding that a restraining order was not necessary 
about 300 people turned out for the groundbreaking where dean 
kahler one of nine students wounded when the guardsmen fired on the 
students spoke from his wheelchair 
there is still a stigma and that incident affects all the 
alumni said kahler who was crippled in the shooting 
todays events mark the culmination of that stigma we dont 
have to scratch the scab may 4 every year anymore said kahler 
now a secondterm athens county commissioner who attends yearly 
candlelight vigils commemorating the shootings 
it is time for final resolution said william risman 
chairman of the board of trustees the size and cost of the 
memorial are not of importance and not of true consequence 
the memorial will consist of four granite pylons representing 
the four students who were killed and concrete walkways built on a 
terraced hillside 
architect bruno ast said the scaleddown version is a portion of 
the original design 
jeffrey miller allison krause sandra scheuer and william 
schroeder were killed when more than 60 shots were fired after 
thengov james a rhodes sent the guardsmen to the campus during 
the fourth day of student protests during the vietnam war the 
students were protesting the us invasion of cambodia 
george janik 56 former chairman of the board of trustees said 
the original memorial could have been built if the fundraising 
campaign which was directed at alumni who attended school about the 
time of the shootings had been improved 
its a project that needed to be sold janik said thats 
what i think was missing

the first woman to be elected a bishop of the 
episcopal church says she hopes her precedentsetting position will 
encourage other women but she plans to devote herself to religious 
not political duties 
i do not intend to be an international anglican gadfly moving 
around to promote ordination of women but i will be as supportive 
as possible the rev barbara c harris said wednesday 
her election in september as suffragan or assisting bishop 
touched off a spirited debate among episcopalians over her 
background and qualifications as well as her gender the election 
was formally approved tuesday by a majority of the 118 us bishops 
in her first public comments since her election harris said she 
was glad the approval process was over 
while it has not all been sweetness and light it has certainly 
been bearable because of the support affirmation and love and 
prayerful support i have had she said 
harris was joined at a news conference by presiding bishop david 
e johnson of boston who said a full and formal consecration would 
be held feb 11 he said it could be one of the largest affairs of 
its kind 
harris a former public relations executive who is black said 
she believed racism may have played a part in some of the criticisms 
of her background and qualifications 
given that racism is so prevalent in our society and so woven 
into the fabric of our lives i am certain that there was some 
element of racism present in some of the objections she said 
harris was criticized for being too liberal for being divorced 
and for lacking a college or seminary degree she acknowledged that 
she still had to overcome some opposition 
we recognize that this presents a problem for some people 
theologically and emotionally she said and we must always be 
about helping or attempting to help them to understand what this 
means in the life of the church and to move toward some 
reconciliation with them as far as is possible

with the competition heating up to conquer one of 
balloonings final frontiers a british adventurer is racing to meet 
a spring liftoff date in an attempt to be the first to circle the 
globe by balloon 
we feel its the ultimate challenge for balloonists at the 
moment said julian nott leader of the attempt and an experienced 
balloonist who has set 79 records 
at a news conference wednesday at the explorers club nott 44 
said he and 33yearold copilot buddy squires would take off in 
their 10story high heliumfilled balloon at the end of march from 
a world war ii blimp hangar near los angeles 
the race is on nott said there have been five attempts 
other people are talking about making attempts there are a lot of 
people whove announced they are going to make flights but theres 
no one whos actually shown any hardware 
nott predicted he and squires would succeed where others have 
failed because a pressurized crew cabin would allow his balloon to 
sail in the relative calm of the jet stream well above the stormy 
weather of lower altitudes 
the balloonists intend to soar to 35000 feet head east over the 
southern united states the atlantic ocean north africa saudi 
arabia india southeast asia and china and set down in california 
some 25000 miles and 18 days later 
nott said he had permission from about 35 foreign countries to 
float over their territory he said the voyage has cost about 15 
million so far 
the announcement was not the first time the british balloonist 
had said he would try to fly nonstop around the world at a 1986 
news conference nott told reporters he would lift off in march 1987 
from western australia and head east over new zealand and the south 
pacific that plan was scrapped a few months later 
nott admitted wednesday he had been overly optimistic and 
underestimated the complexity of his ambitions 
its just taken longer than we thought he said everybody 
involved has been a little bit overwhelmed its simply a bigger 
effort than we thought

serial killer ted bundy executed this week may 
have killed more than 100 girls and young women in murderous sex 
rages from coast to coast says an investigator who tracked him for 
15 years 
my feeling is he has killed way over 100 said bob keppel 
who as a king county detective investigated the eight ted 
killings that occurred in western washington in 1974 the first that 
were connected to bundy 
in a frenzy of lastminute confessions that brought keppel and a 
parade of investigators from other states to florida state prison 
bundy confessed to all eight and 15 more nationwide and provided 
information on dozens of others 
keppel now a washington state attorney generals investigator 
acknowledged that exact numbers may never be known and offered no 
details to support his estimate at a news conference wednesday 
he did play excerpts from a chilling tape recording of a 
confession bundy made friday to the killing of university of 
washington student georgann hawkins one of the ted victims 
the slayings were so called because witnesses recalled seeing a 
handsome young stranger named ted in areas where several victims 
disappeared 
bundy described a trademark ruse in which he outfitted himself 
with crutches or a sling or cast then asked young women for help in 
carrying books or other items to his car where he knocked them 
unconscious and drove away to murder them 
i asked her to help me carry the briefcase which she did 
and we walked back up the alley toward his car bundy said on the 
tape when we reached the car i knocked her unconscious with 
the crowbar there were some handcuffs there along with the 
crowbar i handcuffed her and put her in the passengers side of 
the car and drove away 
she was unconscious but very much alive 
he said ms hawkins regained consciousness and described driving 
her to the foothills near issaquah 15 miles east of seattle where 
he killed her but keppel stopped the tape before bundy recounted 
the gruesome details out of respect he said for the victims 
family 
its bad thats about all i can say keppel said 
i was shocked he said of the way the victims were treated 
adding that investigators hadnt known bundys methods because the 
victims were found weeks and months after their deaths and many 
bones had been scattered by animals 
bundy 42 was executed tuesday for the 1978 kidnap rape and 
murder of 12yearold kimberly leach he was also convicted in 
florida of the 1978 murders of two sorority sisters 
investigators who spent time with him during his last days 
compared notes and when they added cases up realized bundy had been 
involved in up to 50 homicides 
florida state attorney jerry blair said fbi agent bill hagmeier 
told him that bundys confessions closed the books on 13 killings in 
washington utah and colorado provided information that may never 
be confirmed on 14 more cases in washington utah idaho 
california vermont and pennsylvania and touched on at least 20 
more slayings in various states dating back to 1969 
arthur norman a forensic psychologist on bundys defense team in 
1986 and 1987 said after the execution that bundy earlier admitted 
killing two women in new jersey in may 1969 but a bundy lawyer 
polly j nelson said bundy had denied killing anyone during his 
time in philadelphia 
norman said bundy after many hours of talking admitted the 1969 
murders of susan davis 19 of camp hill pa and elizabeth perry 
19 of excelsior minn on the new jersey shore the oregonian 
newspaper of portland reported 
ms perrys father ray p perry who lives in seattle said the 
possibility of bundy being connected with his daughters murder had 
briefly crossed his mind recently considering whats been in the 
papers 
but he added that he needs more than a report of a confession 
before believing bundy committed the murder 
bundy who grew up in tacoma was a 22yearold student at temple 
university in philadelphia at the time he returned to the seattle 
area in the summer of 1969 
keppel said bundy a law school dropout and onetime republican 
activist in washington state remained coldblooded and manipulative 
to the last as he meted out information on his victims in hopes of 
delaying his execution 
the whole thing was orchestrated from the very beginning 
keppel said of the law enforcement officers invited by bundy to 
prison late last week 
the only sorrow bundy felt at the end despite his tears was for 
himself keppel said he added that the murderers final interview 
laying some of the blame for his madness on a youthful addiction 
to pornography was nonsense 
pornography is maybe oneonethousandth of the whole problem he 
had keppel said calling bundys interview with james dobson a 
religious broadcaster and psychologist totally selfserving 
keppel has interviewed bundy several times during the past few 
years and said he would take the information gathered in his latest 
sessions and present it to other law enforcement agencies in hopes 
it will help solve some stillunexplained murders

gynecologist james c burt has surrendered 
his license to practice medicine but remains unbowed before 
challenges to his selfdescribed love surgery 
the state medical board announced wednesday that it had accepted 
burts offer to surrender his ohio medical license and said the 
surrenderrevocation also includes a requirement that burt 67 
not practice medicine anywhere in the country 
but in a statement accompanying the announcement burt again 
denied that he had ever performed the surgery a physical 
alteration of female genitalia aimed at enhancing sexual 
responsiveness without patient consent 
every patient i have ever delivered or operated upon has had at 
least one informed consent said burt who practiced in dayton 
last month the state medical board charged burt with gross 
immorality for 41 alleged violations ranging from overprescribing 
drugs to performing unnecessary surgeries the board charged that 
the surgery caused sexual dysfunction emotional distress 
infection chronic pain incontinence and the need for corrective 
surgery in many patients 
at least three malpractice lawsuits are pending against burt 
each asking 3 million in damages the women say burt performed the 
surgery without their consent burt has denied the charges 
burt had faced a jan 30 hearing before the medical board but 
the panel said its acceptance of the surrenderrevocation 
eliminates the necessity for formal disciplinary hearings since 
license revocation is the maximum penalty the board can impose on a 
licensee 
burts attorney earl moore said the doctor had been considering 
retirement for some time and did not believe the board would treat 
him fairly 
he will write and lecture and give seminars moore said 
the saga of doctor burt is far from over hes more concerned now 
about helping his patients and friends and other doctors 
moore said burt might continue to promote his surgical technique 
the matter was brought to public attention when the cbstv news 
show west 57th aired a report on burts socalled female 
circumcision technique 
the procedure involved the reconstruction and relocation of the 
vagina and the removal of flesh covering the clitoris an external 
tissue that responds to sexual stimulation burt described the 
technique in his 1975 book surgery of love 
burt performed 170 of the operations at st elizabeth medical 
center in dayton the last one in february 1987 he agreed to stop 
performing the surgery at the hospital last november at the request 
of hospital officials 
hospital officials said tuesday that an internal investigation 
concluded that all 170 operations were done with patient consent and 
that the hospital plans no further action against burt

undisturbed memorial to its victims

the most prominent liberal 
member of parliament said today that she will seek the impeachment 
of a judge for his lenient sentencing of a white farmer who beat a 
black worker to death 
helen suzmans announcement came as the johannesburg bar council 
in a rare denunciation of a judicial decision said it was outraged 
by the sentence 
the farmer jacobus vorster tied one of his workers to a tree 
and beat him with fists and whips over a twoday period in december 
1987 because the black man eric sambo accidentally killed one of 
vorsters dogs with a tractor 
in november justice jj strydom gave vorster a fiveyear 
sentence that was suspended on condition he pay a 3000 rand 
1360 fine and pay 130 rand 55 a month to sambos widow and 
children for five years 
the lawyers council in a statement today in the johannesburg 
newspaper business day said the suspended jail term and fine were 
so grossly inappropriate as to induce not simply a state of shock 
but one of outrage 
the sentence imposed by strydom in the northern town of louis 
trichardt occurred after vorster 22 pleaded guilty to culpable 
homicide an intermediate charge between murder and manslaughter 
when there is no clear proof of premeditation 
the judge said vorsters guilt was lessened because of his youth 
and the fact that he had consumed liquor prior to the assault 
south african criminal law does not set specific maximum 
sentences leaving that to the judges discretion but the head of 
the bar council max labe said vorster should have been given a 
substantial prison term labe said in a telephone interview that 
culpable homicide sentences usually are less than 10 years but that 
this killing was particularly brutal 
mrs suzman the longestserving parliament member with the 
antiapartheid progressive federal party said she would move for 
strydoms impeachment when parliament reconvenes feb 3 
she described the sentence as outrageously lenient 
the johannesburg bar council said it usually did not comment on 
court rulings but felt this case was exceptional 
if there grew up in the community a belief that such a crime 
could merit so trivial a punishment the maintenance of law and 
order would be gravely endangered and no lawabiding citizen would 
be safe from violent and callous killers the council said 
vorsters sentence contrasts with the death sentences issued to 
several blacks who are awaiting execution at pretoria central prison 
for murdering white farmers

making inquiries said the embassy spokesman on condition of 
anonymity 
earlier christianrun voice of lebanon radio said prospects that 
british hostages would soon be freed were growing 
most hostage releases in the past have been preceded by 
statements from the kidnappers no such statements about keenan or

it hoped to have good news on the hostage soon keenans two 
sisters were reported to be planning to fly to beirut

keenan being released

two police commanders feuding over a 9inch 
statuette of the virgin mary on their shared desk have been put on 
different shifts but their dispute continues before a state 
arbitrator 
the antagonism has spiraled into a fullblown debate over freedom 
of religion and separation of church and state 
people kind of think its silly to be arguing over such a 
thing there are a lot more important things in the world to worry 
about said a lieutenant on the 180member police force who asked 
not to be identified 
the dispute between capt bruce hogan and lt eugene v begley 
started when hogan insisted on placing the pale yellow madonna on 
the desk they shared as the nos 1 and 2 in command of departments 
night shift in this factory town 
the veteran officers began trading insults and jibes as the 
argument escalated last fall hogan accused begley of shrouding the 
religious icon in newspaper whenever the commander stepped out for 
lunch 
begley reportedly further incurred the captains wrath when he 
skirted hogans order not to touch the statuette under any 
circumstances 
i never touched it begley said wednesday i just put the 
cup over it 
in november chief john f hollow transferred begley to dayside 
detective duties 
on tuesday a state arbitrator heard begleys claim that the 
transfer has cost him 45000 in annual pay because by working days 
he can no longer accept extra assignments for traffic control on 
road construction projects 
three more grievance hearings are scheduled through march 
that statue has no place on a police captains desk we have 
catholics protestants jews and im sure a few muslims in this 
department begley said hogan has no right to push his religion 
on other people he should not be flaunting it 
the chief has declined to comment on the case 
it should never have left the inhouse stage spokesman lt 
joseph rowe said the department certainly didnt plan to go 
public with it

an aide to yasser arafat said today the plo 
leader has decided not to ask the united states for a visa to let 
him address an arabamerican group 
the president of the americanarab antidiscrimination committee 
abdeen jabara said this month the group had invited arafat to speak 
at its april meeting and that he had accepted 
nabil shaath one of arafats top political advisers did not 
explain arafats apparent change of heart except to say arafat 
said he will not go on an invitation from an unofficial group 
the only invitation arafat would accept to visit the united 
states would be from officials in washington shaath said 
until december the united states refused to even talk to the 
palestine liberation organization in november washington refused 
arafats request for a visa saying he endorsed terrorism arafat 
had requested the visa so he could address the un general 
assembly and the assembly session was moved to geneva to 
accommodate arafat 
last month arafat renounced terrorism and endorsed un 
resolutions recognizing israels right to exist leading the united 
states to open talks with plo officials in tunisia 
the problem for president bushs administration is that denying 
arafat a visa now could anger arab leaders but granting him one 
would draw fire from israel and groups prominent in us politics 
who support the jewish state 
israel still refuses to deal with the plo which it considers a 
terrorist organization and it has bitterly criticized the us 
decision to talk with it

a mayoral candidates offer to buy back 
assault weapons in the aftermath of the stockton school massacre 
yielded two ak47s and an uzi 
councilman nate holden on tuesday offered to pay up to 300 for 
such weapons from a 50000 campaign fund a plan derided as 
spitballs at battleships by a spokeswoman for mayor tom 
bradleys reelection campaign 
meanwhile police chief daryl gates appeared on abcs 
nightline wednesday night to renew his call to outlaw assault 
rifles today he was expected to announce plans to form a committee 
to explore a 1990 gubernatorial run 
assault rifles became a political issue after an ak47 was used 
last week by drifter patrick purdy to fire more than 100 bullets 
into a schoolyard purdy killed five students and wounded 29 others 
and a teacher before killing himself 
holden said wednesday the buyback plan might stem gang slayings 
any uzi or ak47 that we can get out of the hands of our citizens 
and into the hands of law enforcement where they belong and 
destroyed would be a step forward he said 
bradley spokeswoman dee dee myers said the mayor opposes the sale 
of semiautomatic rifles altogether and favors comprehensive laws 
rather than a buyback 
holden on wednesday said a woman who kept the uzi under her bed 
for several years turned it in to get it out of her life 
a 16yearold and a 23yearold man brought unloaded ak47s to 
two police stations police said the teenager said he received the 
rifle as a gift and just wanted to be rid of it said spokesman

a group of 170 roman catholic 
theology professors today released a declaration strongly 
criticizing pope john paul ii and the churchs ban on artificial 
birth control 
the professors took aim primarily at the pontiffs exercise of 
power in three areas choosing new bishops granting approval to 
teach theology and the popes teachings 
all three areas have been subjects of controversy exemplified by 
the dispute over last months selection of cardinal joachim meisner 
to head the archdiocese of cologne west germany one of the most 
influential church posts in europe meisner was reportedly long 
backed by the pope but opposed by some clerics in cologne who 
considered him too conservative 
when the pope does that which isnt part of his office he 
cannot demand obedience in the name of catholicism the 
germanlanguage statement said he must expect dissent 
the professors who signed the declaration are based in austria 
switzerland the netherlands and west germany they include 
wellknown figures such as hans kueng of tuebingen university and 
belgian theologian edward schillebeeckx as well as many other 
prominent teachers 
another signer was feminist theologian catharina halke of 
nijmegens catholic university in the netherlands 
there are professors ranging from the left to the right said 
dietmar mieth of tuebingen university a spokesman for the group 
they represent a cross section of theology professors in the four 
countries 
both priests and lay teachers signed the sevenpage document 
mieth told the associated press in a telephone interview 
at the vatican spokesman joaquin navarro said i think we are 
talking of a local matter and i know that today the german bishops 
will make known their thoughts on this point of view 
i can also say that some people who signed have withdrawn their 
support of the document navarro added without providing any 
names 
the theologians declaration complained that the pope recently 
has linked the churchs teachings on birth control too closely to 
fundamental articles of faith such as the holiness of god 
it said the link was made so strong that those who criticize the 
churchs ban on artificial birth control are confronted with 
accusations they are attacking the fundamental pillars of 
christian teaching 
the concept of new testament truth and jesus teaching about 
salvation are enlisted by the pope to represent a specific teaching 
that cannot be justified either in holy scripture or in the 
traditions of the church the theology teachers said 
the statement which the group called the cologne declaration 
complained about a rejection of theological argumentation and 
a neglect of the laity in the church it complained of an 
antagonism from above which heightens the conflicts in the church 
by means of rigid discipline 
the rev friedhelm hengsbach a professor at the st georgen 
theology seminary in frankfurt said i dont think the vatican 
will be very pleased 
hengsbach one of the authors of the cologne declaration told 
the associated press the pope cant expect that people will just 
keep saying yes yes a spokesman for west germanys bishops 
said they would respond to the declaration after studying it

the top federal savings and loan regulator said 
today that unless congress and the administration come up with more 
money to resolve the industrys crisis his agency may have to leave 
hundreds of insolvent institutions open 
the legislative failure to provide additional resources in a 
timely fashion would place the federal home loan bank board in a 
position where there is no other option but to cease case 
resolutions m danny wall chairman of the bank board told the 
house budget committee 
the bank board last year spent 38 billion to close insolvent 
institutions or merge them with healthier partners 
wall estimated that insolvent savings and loans are losing 25 
billion a year the bank board has estimated it would cost 45 
billion to 50 billion to clean up the industry private estimates 
run to 100 billion or more 
wall said the bank board will provide an updated cost estimate 
possibly next week 
he said to permit weak institutions to continue to 
deterioratewould ultimately increase the cost of resolution

the foreign ministry charged today that a british 
television documentary blaming the late emperor hirohito for the 
attack on pearl harbor contained serious mistakes 
the british documentary titled hirohito behind the myth 
charges that the emperor knew in detail about japanese plans during 
world war ii and could have called off the attack on us forces at 
pearl harbor that launched japans war against the united states 
a foreign ministry spokesman yoshifumi matsuda said the 
program produced by the british broadcasting corp is unfair 
and ignores evidence that hirohito tried to stop japan from going to 
war 
its not a bad film as a drama but it is a prejudiced film as 
a documentary and a poor film as an academic work matsuda said 
hirohito died jan 7 from intestinal cancer at age 87 
his wartime role has never been fully addressed in japan and 
remains a taboo topic for many japanese 
the television program shown in britain on tuesday was made by 
edward behr a parisbased journalist 
in the program he challenges the image of hirohito as a 
figurehead who reluctantly went along with the militarys war plans 
he quotes a diary kept during world war ii by the lord privy seal 
koichi kido as saying hirohito was smiling broadly and tearful 
with joy at hearing the news of japanese conquests in southeast 
asia 
that is entirely wrong matsuda said he said the foreign 
ministry had examined the diary and other records and on that 
day there was some conversation between the emperor and mr kido 
but the one who cried was kido himself not the emperor 
i dont know what translation he behr used but there are 
many of those sorts of misunderstandings wrong interpretations and 
so forth in the program the ministry spokesman said 
this film deals with history in an unfair manner in the sense 
that it picks up documents and commentary which agree with his view 
and he ignores all other evidence to the contrary matsuda said 
it ignores evidence that the late emperor privately tried very 
hard to prevent the war 
the bbc has sold the documentary for broadcast to television 
stations in australia austria canada hong kong israel south 
korea the netherlands norway spain sweden and the united states 
matsuda said japanese television stations would be free to 
broadcast the program however an official at the japan 
broadcasting corp which often uses bbc programs said it had no 
such plans

the top federal savings and loan regulator said 
today that unless congress and the administration come up with more 
money to resolve the industrys crisis his agency may have to leave 
hundreds of insolvent institutions open 
the legislative failure to provide additional resources in a 
timely fashion would place the federal home loan bank board in a 
position where there is no other option but to cease case 
resolutions m danny wall chairman of the bank board told the 
house budget committee 
the bank board last year spent 38 billion to close insolvent 
institutions or merge them with healthier partners 
wall estimated that insolvent savings and loans are losing 25 
billion a year the bank board has estimated it would cost 45 
billion to 50 billion to clean up the industry private estimates 
run to 100 billion or more 
wall said the bank board will provide an updated cost estimate 
possibly next week 
he said to permit weak institutions to continue to 
deterioratewould ultimately increase the cost of resolution

sinhalese militants killed at least 37 
people in central and southern sri lanka over the past 24 hours 
including an opposition candidate in next months national 
elections police said today 
seven more people were found shot to death but authorities said 
they didnt know if the slayings were politically motivated police 
shot to death another man believed to be a militant 
the government placed troops on alert across the nation and the 
defense ministry warned militants against further attempts to 
disrupt the feb 15 elections 
police blamed most of the killings on the radical sinhalese 
peoples liberation front which has vowed to disrupt the elections 
and opposes past government efforts to make peace with tamil rebels 
victims included nissanka dharmatilleke the 10th opposition 
candidate to be killed since nominations for the national elections 
closed 20 days ago 
military officials who spoke on condition of anonymity declined 
to say who might have killed the 42yearold dharmatilleke 
he belonged to the united socialist alliance a leftist coalition 
whose candidate ossie abeyegoonesekera finished a distant third in 
last months presidential election 
six of the 10 slain candidates belonged to the alliance the 
others belonged to the opposition sri lanka freedom party led by 
sirimavo bandaranaike 
dharmatillekes father two brothers and two political supporters 
also were killed in the attack late wednesday at katugastotta 60 
miles northeast of colombo the capital 
all the victims were sinhalese sri lankas majority ethnic group 
in another attack wednesday night seven sinhalese were shot to 
death at kadugannawa five miles southeast of katugastotta but 
military officials said they did not know if the killings were 
politically motivated 
police said 31 people all sinhalese were killed by militants in 
18 separate incidents in southern and eastern cities they did not 
give details 
a man killed in police firing in southern sri lanka late 
wednesday was identified as jl siripala a suspected militant 
officials said 
opposition parties have blamed the candidates killings on 
supporters of the united national party headed by ranasinghe 
premadasa sri lankas new president members of the governing party 
have denied the charge and blamed the peoples liberation front 
the front has denied responsibility for the latest killings 
sinhalese comprise 75 percent of sri lankas population of 16 
million people and dominate the political and military 
establishments tamils make up 18 percent of the population 
a tamil separatist war in northern and eastern sri lanka has 
prompted a sinhalese backlash the peoples liberation front 
initially targeted the united national party saying premadasas 
predecessor president junius r jayewardene had gone too far in 
his peacemaking efforts with the tamils

a group of liberals in and out of congress 
today denounced former president reagan for a legacy of neglected 
needs and said it will press president bush to do better 
we dont need to play on their turf if we play on their turf 
we lose sen tom harkin diowa said at a news conference at 
which the democracy project a new yorkbased think tank released a 
600page blueprint for liberal action 
we are going to be more than kind and gentle we are going to 
be bold and imaginative said rep ron wyden dore 
in the 38chapter broadside it issued the democracy project 
said we now see the difference between good acts and good acting 
and how popularity is not the same as problem solving 
in an introduction to the volume mark green president of the 
project said both opportunity and peril confront the 41st 
president and the 101st congress 
but diverting america from responding well are the multiple 
crises ronald reagan has bequeathed us he said its hard to 
ignore his accumulation of neglected needs 
the document also criticized bush for failing to deal in his 
campaign with issues ranging from the need for public housing to the 
plight of nuclear weapons production plants 
stressing flags and furloughs may have been a winning political 
formula but it will now take a microscope to detect bushs mandate 
for change green wrote 
the critique did not spare the democrats and their presidential 
nominee either 
clearly reagan and bush have a very few understandable themes 
involving less taxes and government while democrats seem to flit 
from one framework and slogan to another it said michael 
dukakis tried to define himself as the sum of his position papers 
but it still didnt add up to a coherent whole 
the group said bushs call for a kinder gentler nation along 
with his pronouncements on education ethics and the environment 
do obligate him to pursue more compassionate solutions even 
liberal solutions 
among specific recommendations were public financing of senate 
and house races requiring large employers to provide health 
coverage for their workers giving up reagans star wars plan of a 
spacebased missile defense as a bargaining chip to obtain 
reductions in nuclear weaponry and avoiding any precipitous 
balancing of the budget for fear of triggering a recession 
the document contrasts sharply with a blueprint issued dec 8 by 
the conservative heritage foundation which called for greater 
reliance on privatesector health insurance withdrawing from the 
1972 antiballistic missile treaty to permit faster movement on star 
wars and increasing the personal income tax exemption for children 
to 6500 
members of congress listed as attending todays press briefing 
were sens wyche fowler of georgia and tom harkin of iowa and reps 
byron dorgan of north dakota edward markey of massachusetts and 
henry waxman of california all are democrats 
reaganites concluded that the best way to produce sustained 
growth was to concentrate on stimulating welloff investors to save 
invest and produce more the groups analysis said this 
emphasis however conveniently led to a flood of corporate 
giveaways and upscale tax breaks the results savings and 
investment fell after enactment of reagans tax budget program in 
1981 and the distribution of wealth predictably worsened 
it also said that reagan administration family policies have 
been prolife prebirth but once the fetus became an infant the 
government ran away from home 
its an odd priority to think that large corporations need tax 
incentives to be productive but that you ruin a child if you give 
him or her a hot lunch the critique said 
in ussoviet relations the document said reagan deserves 
praise for finally appreciating the need to trade proposals rather 
than insults but failed to formulate a plan for responding to new 
soviet initiatives 
in the field of government ethics it said the former president 
never once publicly reproached his dozens of derelict appointees

lt gov l douglas wilder who confounded 
political experts in 1985 by winning statewide office in the 
conservative south opened a bid today to become the nations first 
elected black governor 
forty years ago working my way through college and law school 
as a waiter and busboy i never dreamed i would have the opportunity 
to run for governor of virginia the 58yearold democrat told 
hundreds of cheering supporters 
wilder announced a three for virginia plan permanent tax 
relief a fight against drugs and drugrelated crime and creation 
of jobs and housing for rural virginians 
wilder has no opposition for the democratic nomination which 
will be decided at the party convention in june state sen daniel 
w bird jr pulled out of the race two days ago citing low 
fundraising 
on the republican side former sen paul trible has announced for 
governor and is expected to face former virginia attorney general 
marshall coleman for the nomination 
louisiana had a black governor during reconstruction but he was 
not elected lt gov pinckney pinchback became acting governor in 
187273 after gov henry warmoth was removed from office 
in 1985 wilders nomination for lieutenant governor drew 
predictions of doom for the party ticket in virginia which is 82 
percent white 
but wilder and his running mate gerald l baliles won thanks 
in part to the popularity of outgoing gov charles s robb now a 
us senator wilder received 44 percent of the white vote and 97 
percent of the black vote 
baliles is barred by the state constitution from seeking a second 
consecutive term 
as a state senator from richmond in the 1970s wilder was seen as 
a leftofcenter oddity in a body dominated by conservative whites 
wilders views and his rhetoric have moderated however he 
refused to use race as an issue in the 1985 campaign and has been a 
generally loyal if sometimes fretful team player as lieutenant 
governor 
in his biggest rift with baliles he complained about a 
halfpenny sales tax increase passed in 1986 but wilders criticism 
came after the session and angered the governor who wanted to know 
why wilder did not speak up sooner

experts from opec and independent oilproducing 
nations met today in a second attempt to reach a cooperative 
agreement to support crude oil prices 
both sides gathered at a hall this morning in the city londons 
financial district for a second joint session a first and 
unsuccessful meeting took place last april 
the secretarygeneral of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries subroto told reporters wednesday that the two sides 
will exchange information today and plan to issue a joint 
statement afterward 
the nonopec group issued a communique wednesday saying the 
nonopec delegates unanimously share the desire to see the oil 
market stabilize an issue they consider of importance to both 
consumers and producers of oil 
a senior opec source said he was hopeful an agreement could be 
reached for independent producers to cut their production although 
he said that wasnt likely soon 
our unity is stronger now prices have strengthened and we are 
ready for a cooperative agreement said the opec source who 
requested anonymity 
this is the first step in a stepbystep move to push up oil 
prices the source added 
in april six nonopec producers met with representatives from 
six of opecs 13 members and suggested they jointly cut their 
exports by 5 percent opec then more divided rejected that 
proposal 
this time some of the seven attending nonopec producers might 
offer to cut their collective production by 5 percent without 
asking for reciprocal cuts from opec nonopec sources said this 
week 
they likely would want reassurances from opec that in that event 
the cartel would not increase its own production 
the spot price of north sea brent blend the most widely traded 
international crude oil was 1676 a barrel in afternoon trading 
today up 16 cents from late wednesday west texas intermediate the 
us benchmark crude oil rose 25 cents to 1837 a barrel today in 
latemorning trading on the new york mercantile exchange 
the nonopec communique said representatives of angola china 
colombia egypt malaysia mexico and oman met with observers from 
the soviet union norway the yemen arab republic and the canadian 
province of alberta and the states of alaska and texas 
opec participants feel that if all goes well this week the next 
step would be to call a meeting of the ministers of the six members 
of the opec contact group with ministers from the participating 
nonopec countries the source said 
that is likely to take place in late march to coincide with an 
opec committee meeting scheduled for march 29 in vienna the source 
said 
holding such a meeting might be useful to help support oil prices 
during the second quarter when demand traditionally slackens and 
prices weaken 
opec members agreed in november to limit their production to 185 
million barrels a day in an effort to boost prices to a targeted 18 
a barrel the agreement was effective jan 1 
opec members are producing an estimated 195 million barrels a 
day down as much as 35 million barrels a day from the fourth 
quarter that has helped oil prices recover from about 12 a barrel 
in december 
in their previous accord opec members agreed to limit production 
to 1506 million barrels a day 
the next full opec ministerial meeting is scheduled for june 
the other opec members are ecuador gabon libya qatar iran 
iraq and the united arab emirates

a koreanamerican businessman charged in a 
plot to export nerve gas had contacts at us military bases and 
possessed army fact sheets available only to authorized defense 
contractors a prosecutor said today 
assistant us attorney anne singer raised the issues after an 
attorney for the short hills businessman juwhan yun asked a judge 
to release his client on bail 
yun 48 had also asked bendix technologies about buying a 
chemical agent that could be used to mask the presence of sarin the 
deadly nerve gas that the government accuses him of trying to 
acquire said ms singer 
correspondence found in his possession does show that he has 
contacts with persons at us military bases she told us 
district judge h lee sarokin after the hearing ms singer 
declined to elaborate on her statement 
she also told the judge yun was not an authorized defense 
contractor but had fact sheets provided by the army only to 
contractors on an approved distribution list 
last week ms singer disclosed that investigators searching 
yuns summit business komex international corp found national 
security documents marked secret and confidential 
today she said those papers amount to 30 pages in english and 
100 pages in korean which indicates some documents were jointly 
classified by the us and south korean governments 
he has a source of documents somewhere said the prosecutor 
she said an espionage charge could be added to the indictment which 
charged yun with conspiring to violate federal controls on arms 
exports 
ms singer repeated that yun boasted of highlevel contacts with 
civilian and military officials of foreign governments including 
south korea the peoples republic of china and yugoslavia 
yun would spend much money entertaining them when they came to 
this country she said 
sarokin asked the government for further transcripts of yuns 
dealings with an undercover customs agent posing as an arms dealer 
before ruling on yuns bail request he did not indicate when he 
would rule 
a magistrate had set bail at 2 million which yun met through 
friends posting their properties but withdrew it last friday after 
ms singer revealed yuns alleged possession of the classified 
documents 
yuns attorney stephen dratch argued it was unfair to hold yun

soviet and afghan troops shelled both 
ends of a major tunnel north of afghanistans capital in raids that 
killed hundreds of civilians western diplomats said today 
the diplomats who demanded anonymity quoted reports from kabul 
as saying that after bombing of north and south ends of salang 
tunnel soviet and afghan artillery obliterated all dwellings and 
villages south of the tunnel 
they quoted afghan sources including an eyewitnesss report as 
saying the raids occurred monday at the salang tunnel on the main 
highway which connects afghanistan and the soviet union 
soviet forces and afghan special guard committed a major 
atrocity in salang area on monday the diplomats said 
reportedly hundreds of civilians were killed 
according to eyewitnesses no dwellings remain they said 
a dispatch received from western diplomats in kabul said 
witnesses reported seeing soviet tanks rolling over dead bodies of 
victims of salang road 
the dispatch said the account of destruction of all dwellings 
came from three separate sources including one diplomat who is an 
outspoken defender of afghan president najib 
also today afghanistans staterun radio kabul said 206 
guerrillas were killed in two days of fighting in the eastern 
province of parwan it said 109 more rebels were killed in a clash 
in the southeastern city of kandahar today 
the radio monitored in islamabad gave no other details 
the report came the same day moslem insurgents said they had 
stepped up attacks on kandahar afghanistans secondlargest city 
because the soviets were airlifting tons of arms and ammunition to 
prop up government forces there 
the afghan news agency run by the hardline hezbiislami 
guerrilla group said soviet aircraft were bombarding rebel 
positions around the city 
the situation in kandahar is speedily taking a turn for the 
worse and the russian planeloads of sophisticated armaments are on 
the increase it said 
the news agency claimed the airlift was meant to prevent the fall 
of the city to the guerrillas or holy warriors before feb 15 
the deadline for the red armys withdrawal from afghanistan 
the afghan mujahedeen around kandahar have escalated their 
combined attacks on the airport with a view to blocking the sole 
soviet military supply line so as to tighten the economic blockade 
of the city it reported 
other guerrilla sources claimed rebels downed two helicopters 
with antiaircraft guns jan 19 during an attack on kandahars 
airport 
there was no independent confirmation of that action but western 
diplomats and travelers have backed up reports of increased fighting 
around the city which remains under communist control 
radio kabul on wednesday reported the killing of more than 700 
rebels in recent fighting noncommunist observers usually describe 
such high casualty counts as exaggerated 
western diplomats in islamabad claim radio kabul has broadcast 
several false reports of communist victories to boost the morale of 
government forces who the diplomats say are increasingly nervous at 
the prospect of facing the wellarmed mujahedeen alone after the 
soviets leave 
the radio repeatedly has broadcast reports of killings of 
american pakistani and other foreign advisers in afghanistan 
washington and islamabad who back the rebels have denied having 
anyone but embassy staff in afghanistan 
moscow agreed in last years unsponsored accord to end its 
nineyear military involvement in the afghan war by feb 15 
the ruling peoples democratic party of afghanistan seized power 
in a 1978 military coup soviet forces intervened in december 1979 
to replace one promoscow government with another and about 115000 
red arny troops stayed on to help it fight a growing insurgency 
western diplomats say the final phase of the pullout is in full 
swing they have predicted that most soviet combat units will be out 
of the country by the end of january half had left by aug 15

president bush called israeli prime minister 
yitzhak shamir for a very general discussion but no plans were 
made for the two to meet press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
today 
fitzwater said bushs call to shamir on wednesday was one of a 
series of conversations the president has been having by telephone 
this week with world figures who had sent congratulatory messages on 
his inauguration 
they did discuss the idea that theyd both like to visit each 
others countries the spokesman said but no dates were set and 
no specific commitments were made 
fitzwater also said the new administration opposes direct talks 
between top us officials and yasser arafat chairman of the 
palestine liberation organization 
we believe it would be premature at this time for arafat to 
meet with secretary of state james a baker iii or with bush the 
spokesman said 
the us government authorized state department diplomats to have 
contacts with plo representatives in the waning days of the reagan 
administration this came after arafat publicly renounced terrorism 
as an instrument of policy and said he accepted israels right to 
exist 
we will be watching the actions of the plo as they undertake to 
uphold their recent promises fitzwater said when asked whether 
the united states would upgrade the level of contacts with the plo 
we are looking for a longterm commitment he said 
and we will be judging accordingly but its too soon at this time 
to talk about those kinds of meetings

a private group today proposed elaborate 
measures to seal the southern border against illegal immigrants but 
derided government plans for a carblocking ditch south of san diego 
as too little too late 
the federation for american immigration reform proposed 
installing stronger and higher metal fences concrete barriers and 
electronic surveillance equipment along the 200 miles of the mexican 
border where most illegal immigration occurs 
if we are to regain control of the southern border we will 
have to begin to deter illegal entry rather than merely apprehend 
those hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens who cross our northern 
and southern land borders every year said the report locking 
uninvited gate crashers out is just good common sense 
the report was issued a day after the border patrol announced 
plans to build a 5footdeep 4milelong ditch in an attempt to 
stop drug smugglers from driving across a flat desert from mexico to 
san diego 
the ditch which associate attorney general francis a keating ii 
likened to a buried berlin wall will traverse an area east of 
san ysidro calif that is a major drug smuggling route 
but patrick burns assistant director of fair said the 
drainage ditch is too little too late if it is to be taken seriously 
as a method of deterring illegal entry 
mike gregg a border patrol spokesman in san diego said the 
ditch a joint project between ins and the international boundary 
and water commission would cost an estimated 2 million 
gregg said the ditch would also serve to drain runoff that has 
vexed residents on both sides of the border mexican authorities 
have also expressed interest in installing the ditch to solve the 
drainage problem he said 
fair estimated the cost of its more ambitious proposal at 200 
million 
burns group proposed charging a 2 user fee for every person who 
crosses the border to finance construction of better fences and 
steppedup border patrols 
where a fence exists at all it often lies torn and tattered 
the report said gaping holes invite illegal entry and efforts 
to patch them amount to bailing water in a sinking ship 
the nonpartisan organizations advisory committee includes 
former attorney general william french smith exsen walter d 
huddleston dky and former colo gov richard lamm it issued its 
recommendations in a report entitled ten steps to securing 
americas borders 
the flood of illegal immigrants reflected by the increase of 
border arrests from 202111 in 1970 to 19 million three years ago 
cant be stopped unless the border is more secure the group said 
everyone has the right to lock his own back door those who 
ignore the lock and enter without permission are guilty of breaking 
and entering this is the transgression of the illegal alien it 
said 
we must recognize that stopping illegal entry will involve 
deterrence detection apprehension and repatriation 
burns said the border patrols planned ditch would be an obstacle 
only to a fraction of illegal immigrants entering southern 
california 
there is a serious problem at san diego of which a very very 
small component is highspeed drivethroughs he said 
burns noted that illegal aliens account for 20 percent of the 
felony arrests in san diego county 
the ditch wont put a dent in the crossborder drug traffic 
either because they have hundreds of millions of dollars worth of 
narcotics being smuggled through the port of entry he said 
san ysidro with more than 50 million crossings annually is the 
worlds busiest port of entry according to the report 
for this region the report proposes building a 20milelong 
12foot sunken concrete retaining wall topped by an eightfoot metal 
fence the earth would be graded so that the concrete wall would be 
built into the ground 
illegal aliens would face nothing less than a smooth vertical 
wall which would be virtually impossible to scale without a ladder 
the governments proposed ditch was termed a potential deathtrap 
by one mexicanamerican leader 
if its an obstacle that could injure someone then we cannot 
tolerate it jess haro president of san diegos chicano 
federation said wednesday id like to believe that we are not in 
the business where we are out to maim people 
the report also called for installing electronic ground sensors 
which transmit radio signals to base stations when they detect 
movement as well as a lowlight television surveillance system for 
a onemile section on either side of san ysidro 
similar sunken earth fences are proposed for el paso texas 
which accounts for 20 percent of southernborder arrests 
concrete rails and secure metal fences are proposed for other 
border areas 
most of the remaining 1800 miles of the usmexican border is 
over such treacherous terrain that few people attempt to enter the 
country there the report said

a group of liberals in and out of congress 
urged president bush thursday to go slow in reducing the budget 
deficit and abandon the reagan administrations obsession with 
the star wars program of spacebased missile defense 
the democracy project a selfdescribed progressive research 
group based in new york outlined its views at a news conference at 
which officers of the project were joined by democratic members of 
congress 
the risks of reducing the deficit too quickly are at least as 
serious as the risks of doing nothing at all said james 
galbraith a professor of economics at the university of texas and a 
former director of the joint economic committee of congress 
any precipitous balancing of the federal budget the group 
said in its report would run the risk of triggering a recession 
paul warnke head of the arms control and disarmament agency in 
the carter administration spoke for the organization on foreign 
policy saying that bush has an almost unparalleled opportunity to 
remove the risk of nuclear war and end the military confrontation in 
europe 
one of the principal obstacles standing in the way he said is 
the obsession that has existed with regard to strategic defense 
but he said this obstacle is removing itself because neither 
the technology nor the funds are there 
in its report the group recommended that the bush administration 
use the star wars plan as a bargaining chip in negotiations to 
obtain reductions in nuclear weaponry something the reagan 
administration refused to do 
commenting on the groups report sen tom harkin diowa 
suggested that congressional democrats should not accept bushs 
budget if it makes only minor adjustments in the reagan budget 
we dont need to play on their turf if we play on their turf 
we lose said harkin 
we are going to be more than kind and gentle we are going to 
be bold and imaginative said rep ron wyden dore 
the democracy project report said we now see the difference 
between good acts and good acting and how popularity is not the same 
as problem solving 
it said bush failed to deal in his campaign with such issues as a 
need for public housing and the problems of nuclear weapons plants 
stressing flags and furloughs may have been a winning political 
formula but it will now take a microscope to detect bushs mandate 
for change said mark green president of the project in an 
introduction to the book 
the project also had some critical words for the democrats and 
their unsuccessful presidential nominee saying clearly reagan 
and bush have a very few understandable themes involving less taxes 
and government while democrats seem to flit from one framework and 
slogan to another michael dukakis tried to define himself as the 
sum of his position papers but it still didnt add up to a coherent 
whole

defense secretarydesignate john tower told a 
senate confirmation hearing today that laws should be tightened to 
prevent officials from profiting unfairly unethically or 
illegally or inordinately if they move between pentagon and 
industry jobs 
tower also assured the senate armed services committee that the 
763777 he collected as a defense consultant over the past three 
years would not influence actions he might take as defense secretary 
tower said he terminated all consulting contracts on dec 1 one 
day after meeting with president bushs transition staff and 
learning that he was under serious consideration for the defense 
post 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee 
expressed his concern about the perception of former consultant 
heading the defense department 
the likelihood is i will bend over backwards to avoid 
favoring his former associates tower said 
your former clients might worry nunn said 
that may be true tower responded 
under persistent questioning from sen carl levin dmich tower 
said he would disqualify himself from making decisions on the combat 
flight inspection system which allows airborne aircraft to check on 
whether landing transmitters are working correctly because of the 
extensive lobbying he did for the program 
but he refused to specify any other projects from which he would 
disqualify himself saying he would handle those on an ad hoc 
basis 
tower also cautioned congress that it should write 
revolvingdoor laws carefully enough so that honest 
hardworking people who might want to engage in public service are 
not summarily proscribed from working at the pentagon 
tower noted that donald j atwood whom he has chosen as deputy 
defense secretary has been vice chairman of the general motors 
corp a major pentagon contractor he said other top aides would be 
drawn from the defense industry as well 
the atmosphere at the hearings was polite as the senators 
questioned their former colleague tower a texas republican spent 
24 years in the senate including a stint as chairman of the armed 
services committee from 198184 
nunn told tower that i know you and i know you are an honest 
person 
frankly the difficulty here is not that you have worked for a 
contractor as a consultant but a number of them five or six or 
seven of the major corporations nunn said if you were to 
recuse not involve yourself on all of them you couldnt be 
secretary of defense 
tower told the committee that i faced up to this problem when i 
was chairman of the commission appointed by president reagan to 
investigate the irancontra affair 
in that role he said he was required to inquire into and 
investigate the actions of a president to whom i was deeply loyal 
it was not a pleasant experience 
my loyalty to my country transcends any of these loyalties 
said tower 
at the opening of his second day of testimony tower told the 
armed services committee about his role as a consultant to several 
major defense contractors including rockwell international martin 
marietta textron ltv and british aerospace 
sen john warner rva asked tower whether he thought tougher 
laws were needed to prevent the type of activities alleged in the 
current investigation of transfer of information on pending 
contracts being sold by pentagon employees to defense contractors 
and consultants 
tower said he never engaged in such activities but that in 
light of what has happened laws should be tightened 
to say what i would advise in detail is a little bit difficult 
for me now because i need to get into the problem and get a handle 
on it before i could recommend any specific legislative proposals 
along that line he said 
he said legislation was needed to reduce the likelihood if not 
foreclose anyone who had been in the defense department from 
profiting unfairly unethically or illegally or inordinately in an 
industry job 
tower told lawmakers wednesday that as of dec 1 he had severed 
his ties with defense contractors he had worked for as a consultant 
over the past two years and did not stand to gain from the 
prosperity of any former associate 
in other testimony wednesday tower disavowed the label of 
mindless hawk and promised to take a hard look at all weapons 
systems in trimming the defense budget 
he said the new bush administration will conduct a thorough 
review in which nothing is sacred while it searches for 
solutions to the budget deficit 
there is no room in the defense budget for costly mistakes 
he said 
tower who championed reagans trilliondollar military buildup 
said he is realistic about the constraints imposed by the budget 
deficit 
i am not such a mindless hawk that i will come before you and 
ask for increases i know you will not grant he said 
tower declined to specify what cuts might be made repeating the 
refrain that nothing is sacred when questioned about the mx and 
midgetman nuclear missiles and the number of navy aircraft carriers 
he stressed however that the new administration will tailor 
the military to the strategy

operation tehran radio said but the plant on the caspian sea will 
produce only a fraction of its prewar capacity of 1760 megawatts 
the radio monitored in nicosia said the plant will boost the

twentysix years after the confrontation that 
brought the world to the brink of nuclear war americans and cubans 
who led their countries through the cuban missile crisis will meet 
here for the first time to discuss it 
a lot of things were done a lot of things were said that 
created a great deal of bitterness said james blight of harvard 
universitys john f kennedy school of government which is 
organizing the conference 
this is a rather risky experience we dont know quite what is 
going to happen he told reporters thursday 
americans and soviets have discussed the october 1962 crisis over 
the deployment of soviet nuclear missiles in cuba at conferences 
sponsored by the kennedy school in 1987 
but the conference that begins thursday night with a private 
reception is the first time that the us and cuban participants 
will meet facetoface 
scheduled to be among the participants were former us defense 
secretary robert s mcnamara and sergio delvalle a longtime 
confidant of cuban leader fidel castro delvalle is a member of the 
cuban communist partys central committee and was the military chief 
of staff in 1962 
among the other us participants were mcgeorge bundy theodore 
sorensen pierre salinger and sen edward kennedy 
from the soviet side former president andrei a gromyko and the 
former ambassador to washington anatoly f dobrynin were expected 
to attend gromyko 79 was the soviet foreign minister in 1962 
each side has its own name for the crisis and its own version of 
events and for the first time we will try to merge those three 
crises into one oral history said bruce allyn of the kennedy 
school 
organizers said only in isolated cases have any top officials of 
the administration of john f kennedy ever met any of the cuban 
officials who were in top leadership spots of their country during 
the 1962 crisis 
much of the conference will be closed to the press but 
organizers said the opening session friday and a roundtable 
discussion saturday would be open a news conference of the leaders 
of the three delegations is planned for sunday 
organizers only found out thursday that the cuban delegation 
would include three senior officials delvalle politburo member 
jorge risquet and another central committee member emilio aragones 
navarro 
they said the series of conferences in the past year and a half 
indicate that officials who led their governments through the crisis 
have a personal interest in establishing an accurate picture of what 
happened 
because of the age of many of the participants this is likely to 
be the last major conference on the cuban missile crisis said 
philip j brenner an expert on cuba attending the conference from 
the american university in washington 
blight coauthor of a book on the crisis on the brink said 
american scholars are hoping to get answers from senior soviet 
officials on several questions 
included are why the soviet union apparently believed it was in 
imminent peril of an allout nuclear attack by the united states and 
its allies and why soviet premier nikita s khrushchev had the 
missiles sent secretly to cuba rather than making their deployment 
a public response to deployment of us missiles in turkey and 
elsewhere

if all goes as planned actor burt reynolds

escape from prison friday but the sniping from unhappy townspeople 
is a more immediate threat 
residents living near the lantana correctional institution say 
theyve had enough of breakouts lately real or as part of a 
television script 
reynolds blue period productions will film the escape from the 
minimumsecurity prison for the third episode of the bl 
stryker detective series publicist carol feder said wednesday 
the plot is a little too authentic for lantana town manager don 
harvey who told department of corrections officials he objected to 
the idea because his community is tense over a series of escapes 
from the prison last year 
the timing is absolutely inappropriate harvey said i 
dont think this community needs to go through any other trauma with 
real or simulated events at lci 
to avoid crowds of onlookers producers normally dont release 
advance information about filming locations feder said but 
concerns from harvey and others prompted the production company to 
alert residents to fridays filming 
well be posting notices in the area so residents wont be

for the first year of those 415 contracts covering bargaining 
units with 1000 or more members the average pay gain is 26 
percent the labor department said 
that compared to average firstyear increases of 18 percent and 
overall annual raises of 26 percent in those workers prior 
contracts most of which had been negotiated in 1985 or 1986

women whose beauty salons have been barred 
from using traditional brush curlers are making a hairraising noise 
in the state legislature which is considering a bill to lift the 
ban 
this was the one thing we found during our campaign that people 
were really opposed to said rep wilbur vander vorst 
the state board of cosmetology issued its edict banning brush 
curlers last july the board contended the curlers which are rather 
like little round hairbrushes without handles are unsanitary 
because hair tends to stick in the bristles 
but many women prefer them 
rep kathi gilmore said the board should have sanctioned beauty 
parlors whose brush rollers were found to have stray hairs on them 
rather than banning a vital tool of the trade gilmore who is 
sponsoring legislation to lift the prohibition testified at a state 
house committee hearing wednesday 
legislators said they are being bombarded with calls about 
gilmores bill gilmore said she had received more than 70 while 
sen david oconnell reported getting more than 200

three members of a polygamist clan were 
sentenced today to prison terms of up to 15 years for the slaying of 
a law officer during a shootout that ended a 13day standoff at 
their farm last year 
the penalties will be served after they complete federal prison 
terms for taking part in the bombing of a mormon chapel 
state district judge michael murphy sentenced clan leader addam 
swapp and brotherinlaw john timothy singer to one to 15 years for 
manslaughter and swapps brother jonathan to a year in jail for 
negligent homicide 
these defendants acted as anarchists the judge said and 
this court has been presented with no credible information that if 
given the opportunity they would not again engage in anarchism and 
armed conflict 
the sentences were pronounced two days before the anniversary of 
the shootout in marion that left state corrections lt fred house 
dead and swapp seriously wounded 
singer and the swapp brothers had been charged with murder in 
houses death but a jury convicted them of lesser charges dec 22 
in may the three defendants and clan matriarch vickie singer 
the mother of john timothy singer and addam swapps two wives were 
convicted of federal violations in the bombing and standoff 
a federal judge sentenced addam swapp to 15 years in prison john 
timothy singer and jonathan swapp to 10 and vickie singer to five 
for those crimes 
murphy today rejected a request to allow the defendants to serve 
their state sentences concurrently with the federal prison terms 
the standoff between the clan and 100 law enforcement officers 
began after addam swapp bombed a nearby mormon chapel authorities 
did not storm the compound for fear of harming the nine children who 
were inside with six adults 
house and another police dog handler had joined an fbi team in an 
attempt to arrest the swapp brothers he was directing his reluctant 
dog toward the pair when he was struck by a bullet that nicked the 
armhole of his armored vest 
singer 21 admitted firing the shot but insisted he was shooting 
at the dogs jonathan swapp 22 also acknowledged firing his rifle 
during the shootout but said he was trying to keep his wounded 
brother from being hit again 
addam swapp 27 who was wounded in the arm and chest by an fbi 
sharpshooter did not fire 
swapp has said the chapel bombing was a divinely inspired act 
intended to trigger the resurrection of his late fatherinlaw john 
singer and the collapse of a wicked and corrupt church and 
state 
singer the clans patriarch was shot in 1979 by police during 
an arrest attempt at the same farm 
he who had clashed with authorities over his refusal to send his 
children to school or teach a stateapproved curriculum and had 
broken with the mormon church over his polygamy which has been 
renounced by the church

a new study of us weather records for the 
past century may raise questions about the theory that the earth is 
being warmed like the inside of a greenhouse 
scientists at the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
report that they can find no evidence of any overall temperature 
increase for the united states although weather does vary 
considerably from year to year 
the report in the january edition of geophysical research 
letters showed no significant change in the nations average 
temperature or precipitation between 1895 and 1987 
researchers agree however that since the study covers only a 
small portion of the earth studies of other areas might have 
different results and while the new study is not necessarily 
inconsistent with a socalled greenhouse effect it fuels an 
escalating scientific debate 
claims that a greenhouselike warming has already begun have 
attracted widespread publicity recently with the heat and drought 
this past summer attracting additional attention 
according to the theory the increasing amount of carbon dioxide 
and some other gases in the atmosphere tend to trap heat from the 
sun warming the earth in somewhat the same way as the glass warms a 
greenhouse 
such a warming could damage crop growing areas melt the polar 
ice caps raise sea levels and have other dire effects according to 
a variety of analyses that have been published 
scientists expressed skepticism about whether the warming has 
already begun however at last months meeting of the american 
geophysical union in san francisco 
indeed some climate experts say any warming would likely result 
in more cloudiness and that would tend to cool the earth by 
reflecting some sunlight back into space 
in addition a study published in the journal of climate in 
november disclosed that an apparent climate warming of as much as 1 
degree fahrenheit could be attributed to the heat generated by 
growing cities since many weather stations are located in urban 
areas 
the most important result of this study is that there is no 
statistically significant evidence of an overall increase in annual 
temperature or change in annual precipitation for the contiguous 
us 18951987 concluded the authors of the new analysis 
that report was compiled by kirby hanson of the noaa air 
resources laboratory george a maul of the noaa atlantic 
oceanographic and meteorological laboratory and thomas r karl of 
the national climatic data center 
they looked at both temperature and moisture since the greenhouse 
theory holds that a warming of the climate would likely result in 
changes in rainfall patterns causing drought in some areas 
assuming the numbers are right they are not inconsistent 
with the greenhouse theory responded john topping of the climate 
institute 
topping who organized a recent conference on coping with the 
greenhouse effect noted that the study covers only the united 
states only about 6 percent of the earth and suggested that 
similar analyses of other areas might have different results 
hanson has concurred that the study covers only a small part of 
the world and that the finding may only represent a regional 
variation rather than a worldwide trend 
james e hansen director of the national aviation and space 
administrations goddard institute for space studies said wednesday 
that he was not surprised by the result 
hansen who told congress last summer that he believes the 
greenhouse warming has begun to affect earth said that the argument 
is over whether the warming has become large enough to measure 
determining that may be hard to do however the noaa researchers 
pointed out in their analysis 
lack of good records in some areas and changes in instruments 
methods of observation exposure of thermometers time of 
observations and other problems make the problem of comparing 
historical records extremely complex 
in their study they analyzed records from some 6000 observing 
points over 93 years and found considerable yeartoyear variation 
but no longterm trend other than an increase in precipitation in 
the fall between 1970 and 1987

the polar bears at the denver zoo helped sell 
voters on a pennyper10 sales tax for cultural institutions that 
is turning metro area residents into some of the nations top 
supporters of the arts and sciences 
the polar bear tax so called because campaigners used a 
drawing of a zoo bear to promote it in order to defuse talk that 
the arts are elitist sailed to victory in the nov 8 election with 
75 percent of the vote in the sixcounty denver region 
the ninemember cultural arts district board which will spend 
the tax revenues was selected this month and will soon send out its 
first grants 
consultant floyd ciruli who oversaw the campaign for the tax and 
continues to advise the board says the 01 percent sales tax is 
unprecedented both in the amount of money it raises and the range of 
organizations it helps 
he hopes it will change denvers sense of itself from cow 
town to culture town and ensure a healthy financial future for 
organizations that have seen their federal and city support sag in 
this era of tight budgets 
every cultural organization in the area is eligible to receive 
funds from the new tax from mainstays like the symphony orchestra 
which last year had a brush with nearbankruptcy to the most 
esoteric dance and theater groups 
the tax breaks down to a little more than 6 per person annually 
more than any other community pays per person in local tax money for 
culture according to ciruli 
denver arts patrons got the idea for the tax from st louis 
where a property tax helps fund a few of the citys largest cultural 
institutions san francisco draws from a lodging tax to help some of 
its major facilities but denvers tax is drawn from the whole metro 
area and finances many more institutions 
lawmakers rejected the idea of a culture tax in 1986 because of 
squabbling in the arts community said greg geissler who heads the 
city of denvers cultural affairs commission local arts and 
government officials then hammered out the existing plan that offers 
something for everyone he said the legislature endorsed it 
last year then the voters gave final approval in november 
in the long run the health of the large institutions is 
directly tied to the overall health of the whole arts community 
geissler said 
the largest chunk of tax revenues about 85 million is 
earmarked for four bigbudget institutions the natural history 
museum the denver art museum the zoo and the denver botanic 
gardens 
a second chunk about 33 million will go to midsize agencies 
like the denver center for the performing arts the denver symphony 
orchestra and the denver balletthe remaining money about 10 
percent of the total will go back to the six counties to be 
distributed to small groups 
there was little organized opposition to the cultural facilities 
tax but some critics said it taxed everybody to pay for elitist 
programs attended by the wealthy 
to counter that criticism backers turned to the popular zoo and 
its polar bears stressing that cultural facilities are used by a 
wide variety of people and saying they help foster tourism 
proponents said the alternative to the tax was high admission fees 
which price the poor out of supposedly public facilities 
cultural programming is becoming one of the best tourist and 
economic development tools that you have said ciruli 
theres no doubt that some of the funds a small part will 
go to cultural styles that are enjoyed by very narrow groups of 
people but thats a tradeoff theres a lot of diversity and 
thats good 
tom peterson the denver zoos marketing director said the zoo 
will use its share of tax proceeds to expand education and 
conservation programs and for projects such as renovation of a 
display of grizzly and black bears as for the polar bears who 
helped pass the tax they already have new quarters

orders to factories for big ticket durable 
goods rose at a robust 64 percent pace in december the government 
said thursday in a report that anaylsts cited as evidence of 
unabated economic strength heading into the new year 
the surprisingly strong increase was the biggest since an 87 
percent rise last june and brought demand for durable goods items 
expected to last three or more years to a seasonally adjusted 
13085 billion in december 
the figures reflected widespread demand in both civilian and 
military categories nonelectrical machinery was the only category 
to post a decline 
cynthia latta an economist with data resources inc in 
lexington mass said the report indicates that so far theres 
certainly not any signs of slowdown in the economy 
but she cautioned while its very strong on the surface the 
disturbing undertone is that machine orders were off 
decembers orders closed out the year on a strong note with 
demand over the last 12 months totaling 143 trillion a 108 
percent increase from 1987 when orders had been up 76 percent over 
the previous year 
last years pace was the best showing since a 123 percent 
increase in 1984 
orders had edged up just 12 percent in 1985 and 04 percent in 
1986 when america was losing both domestic and overseas sales to 
foreign manufacturers 
but us manufacturers have enjoyed an exportled rebound the 
last two years as a decline in the value of the dollar against 
foreign currencies made american products more competitive overseas 
economist john hagens of the wefa group in bala cynwyd pa said 
the health of the us manufacturing industry in 1988 showed that 
at a good price us goods can hold their own in the world 
market 
hagens said that with the dollar unlikley to fall further the 
phenomenal growth in orders and exports generally is not going to be 
there for 1989 but that orders still should come in at a moderate 
pace 
in other reports thursday the labor department said 
the prices americans paid for imported goods rose 41 percent 
during 1988 with prices up 16 percent in the final three months of 
the year 
the fall of the dollar while improving the competitiveness of 
us goods overseas and helping to lower the trade deficit also 
boosts the price of foreign goods in american markets 
firstyear pay raises averaged 26 percent for workers in 
private industry affected by collective bargaining settlements 
signed last year for the full term of major contracts settled last 
year wage increases averaged 24 percent 
decembers increase in orders for durable goods was paced by a 
huge jump in the volatile military category which oscillates 
depending on when big government contracts are signed military 
orders increased 211 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted 
1016 billion after a 215 percent decrease in november 
even excluding defense however orders for durable goods were up 
54 percent in december 
in another erratic category transportation orders increased 20 
percent in december to 3888 billion after a 72 percent decrease a 
month earlier the improvement included large gains in the auto 
aircraft and shipbuilding industries 
excluding transportation the december increase in orders for 
durale goods was 16 percent 
there also was strength in orders for nondefense capital goods 
a category that is closely watched for signs of business intentions 
to expand and modernize demand in this category rose 78 percent to 
3858 billion last month the steepest increase since a 125 
percent jump in june 
in other industries orders for primary metals rose 53 percent 
to 1330 billion and demand for electrical machinery was up 11 
percent to 2034 billion orders for nonelectrical machinery 
dropped 32 percent to 2071 billion most of that decline was in 
engines and turbines 
shipments of durable goods overall rose 38 percent to 12446 
billion in december following a 12 percent increase in november 
shipments for the year totaled 139 trillion up 99 percent 
from 1987

president bush today urged top federal 
executives to help fulfill his quest for an administration beyond 
ethical reproach where government service is seen as a noble 
calling 
there is a mandate to fulfill and there are problems to 
solve bush said in prepared remarks to some 3700 top government 
managers 
bush said the guiding principle of his policy will be simply to 
know right from wrong to avoid even the appearance of what is 
wrong 
bush began stressing ethics during the presidential campaign 
when the reagan administration in which he was vice president came 
under fire for what was dubbed the sleaze factor more than 100 
members of the reagan administration at various times were accused 
of unethical or improper behavior 
bush tried to neutralize that criticism by promising to make 
creation of an ethics panel one his first acts as president 
continuing his emphasis on ethics bush made his first speech 
outside the white house going to the nearby constitution hall of 
the daughters of the american revolution there he spoke to members 
of the senior executive service comprised of toplevel department 
and agency managers most of them career government employees 
i pledge to try to make federal jobs more challenging more 
satisfying and more fulfilling he said i am dedicated to 
making the system work and making it work better 
our principles are clear that government service is a noble 
calling and a public trust bush said 
the president noted that he had appointed a commission wednesday 
to recommend new ethics reform proposals for all three branches of 
government indicating he wants to avoid the kinds of ethical 
problems that often hounded the reagan administration 
bush asked the eightmember advisory commission to come up with 
recommendations for ethics legislation by march 9 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
in naming the presidents commission on federal ethics law 
reform bush said he wants a code of conduct to ensure that those 
who serve the public trust avoid any actual or apparent conflict 
between their personal and public interests 
the president said however the standards should not be so 
unreasonably restrictive that they dissuade capable people from 
entering government 
last fall president reagan vetoed a congressional ethics 
package saying it was excessive and would hamper the governments 
ability to attract toprate people 
bush supported the veto saying at the time that would put 
together his own ethics reforms 
current federal ethics rules do not adequately serve to 
eliminate use of public funds for private gains bush said 
wednesday 
the current framework is fragmented confusing and most 
important it does not incorporate sufficient safeguards to protect 
the public interest in an honest and fair government 
the panel is chaired by griffin bell the former attorney general 
in the carter administration and malcolm wilkey a senior judge on 
the us court of appeals in washington 
besides bell and wilkey other panel members are former white 
house counsels fred fielding and lloyd cutler washington attorney 
jan baran who is counsel to the republican national committee 
former rep harrison schmitt of new mexico former counsel to the 
senate armed services committee r james woolsey and judith bello 
former counsel to the us trade representatives office

the prices americans pay for imported goods 
resumed their upward trend in the final three months of 1988 to post 
a 41 percent increase for the year the government said thursday 
the labor department said import prices rose 16 percent from 
october through december after falling 13 percent in the third 
quarter that had been their first decline in more than two years 
the fourthquarter increase was moderated by a drop in the cost 
of crude oil and other imported fuels which decreased 78 percent 
after plunging 90 percent in the previous three months 
from october through december prices for imported crude 
materials rose by 55 percent imported machinery costs were up 25 
percent intermediate manufacturing products gained 24 percent and 
chemical prices increased 23 percent 
removing the big drop in energy prices all other imported goods 
registered a 24 percent increase over the previous quarter 
last years increase in import prices and a 10 percent rise 
during the previous year were linked to the weakening of the us 
dollar which fell in value by 26 percent in 1988 and 136 percent 
in the previous year according to a tradeweighted index used by 
the labor department 
the fall of the dollar while improving the price competitiveness 
of us goods overseas and helping to lower the us trade deficit 
also has the effect of boosting the prices of foreign goods bought 
in the united states 
the higher import costs affect inflation of consumer prices 
overall which rose 44 percent in 1988 and by a like margin during 
the previous year 
the price of us exports meanwhile fell 02 percent during the 
fourth quarter but still stood 63 percent higher than a year 
earlier 
the biggest decrease in export prices in the fourth quarter 
occurred in the food category which dropped 38 percent after 
shooting up 148 percent in the previous quarter due to the summer 
drought

former president chun doohwan on 
thursday defied the national assembly refusing to testify on his 
role in the armys suppression of an uprising in 1980 
about 500 radical students from several seoul colleges clashed 
with riot police thursday at dongguk university to demand the arrest 
of chun and president roh taewoo a former ally who has distanced 
him from chun radicals hurled hundreds of firebombs and rocks at 
police surrounding the school 
no serious injuries or arrests were reported 
officials took the order issued by the national assembly to the 
remote east coast buddhist temple where chun is living but the 
former president refused it risking prosecution 
instead he issued a statement accepting moral responsibility for 
the civilian uprising in kwangju 
i think i was in a position to take moral and political 
responsibility for kwangju so i have no intention to avoid 
responsibility chun said 
he has said he will answer questions from lawmakers without 
appearing and thursday he said he would testify indirectly 
chun has denied any personal wrongdoing however he went into 
rural exile after surrendering assets worth 24 million and 
apologizing to the nation last november for abuses during his 
administration several members of the expresidents family have 
been arrested or convicted on corruption charges 
former president choi kyuha who briefly held office as a 
figurehead before chun took power with military backing in 1980 
also refused to accept an order to testify after officials took it 
to his seoul home 
by official count about 200 people were killed and more than 
1000 injured when the army put down the uprising in kwangju 
opposition groups claim the casualty toll was much higher and the 
uprising remains a highly emotional and controversial issue 
chun a former general was in control of the armed forces at the 
time and took power of the government a few months later 
the orders to testify were issued after a special assembly 
committee investigating the uprising resumed hearings in seoul the 
assembly is investigating allegations of widespread human rights 
abuses and corruption under chun 
both former presidents said previously that as former heads of 
state they cannot compelled to testify roh has backed chuns 
refusal to testify 
under korean law the parliamentary committee has the power to 
refer the case to prosecutors for legal action but they must then 
decide whether to act 
the opposition is not expected to press immediately for chuns 
prosecution because keeping the issue alive furthers its political 
aims 
if convicted the former presidents could be sentenced to up to 
five years in prison 
chun is also being pressed to testify before another 
parliamentary committee investigating corruption and other misdeeds 
chun stepped down in february after a sevenyear term and was 
replaced by roh who won presidential elections in december 1987 
the opposition is trying to use the kwangju incident and other 
legacies of the authoritarian chun government to weaken the roh 
government roh is still identified with chun in the eyes of many 
koreans 
opposition parties demanded this week that roh keep an election 
promise to submit to a referendum on his administration

a hearing on a zoning change that would let 
unmarried couples live in neighborhoods they had previously been 
excluded from has stirred impassioned debate on both sides 
the denver city council has scheduled a public hearing and debate 
for monday night on a proposed zoning law change that would allow 
two unrelated adults to live in single family residences even in 
areas with the exclusive r0 zoning 
although there are believed to be hundreds of violators two 
people who are not related may not live legally in the restrictive 
r0 zones covering 8 percent of the citys singlefamily homes 
neighborhoods across the city have been papered with leaflets by 
residents who say the zoning change will destroy the quality of life 
by bringing in more people to formerly quiet neighborhoods and 
hurting property values 
many real estate agents on the other hand say the zoning change 
would not hurt property values and might in some cases help them 
it will improve the marketability of some homes said bob 
egan a broker with remax cherry creek by making more people 
eligible to buy homes in singlefamily areas 
carol ihli a broker with coldwell banker and chairwoman of the 
denver board of realtors public affairs committee said she didnt 
think it would affect property values the board opted against 
taking a stand on the zoning change 
the law is now under legal attack and the citys lawyers are not 
sure if it will survive judicial review 
councilman dave doering has proposed the change which he says is 
a compromise that will allow unmarried couples as well as others to 
share houses he said many elderly residents who are widowed prefer 
to live with others for economic and social reasons

reducing the amount of soil lost from the 
nations farmland through water and wind erosion will remain as the 
top goal of federal soil and water conservation agencies through 
1997 an agriculture department report said thursday 
erosion control remains the top priority because of all the 
problems addressed by usda conservation programs erosion is the 
most widespread threat to longterm agricultural productivity and 
environmental quality the report said 
erosion is outpacing soil replenishment passing the 
tolerance level accepted by most conservationists on an 
estimated 277 million acres of nonfederal rural land more than 
california and texas combined 
about 173 million of these acres are cropland on which erosion 
was 23 billion tons in 1982 the report said if left 
unchecked erosion will reduce the ability of the soil to produce 
needed food and fiber 
further it said the silt from eroded soil can damage land air 
and water total costs are virtually impossible to pinpoint but one 
study estimates that water erosion alone costs the nation 3 billion 
to 13 billion each year 
the new report updates the departments national conservation 
program developed in 1982 in response to the soil and water 
resources conservation act of 1977 the law or rca required 
longrange conservation planning by the department for programs 
affecting soil and water conservation on nonfederal lands 
assistant secretary george dunlop said that the protection of 
water quality ranks with erosion abatement in the agriculture 
departments list of priorities in 1982 he said the priorities 
were erosion control and water conservation and upstream flood 
control 
dunlop said additional areas that have come in for greater 
consideration in recent years include the expansion of 
conservation partnership with states local governments and 
landowners working with smallscale poorer and minority farmers 
improving the consistency of programs and cutting costs 
conditions have changed markedly since the 1977 law was passed 
the report said at that time the prices of agricultural commodities 
and the volume of exports were increasing 
famine was stalking many countries and reports of world 
resource degradation were increasing the report said adding to 
the concern was a perception that technology which had provided 
continuous increases in agricultural productivity for decades was 
not likely to provide similar increases in the future 
but in the early 1980s the situation sharply reversed with a 
drop in world demand a global recession and serious debt problems 
in many importing countries at the same time world agricultural 
production was rising and surpluses grew 
one result was renewed attention to conservation and the 1977 
laws process for looking ahead to solving soil and water problems 
the report said 
the 1985 farm law included authorization of the conservation 
reserve program or crp which enables farmers to take highly 
erodible land from crop production for 10 years and protect it with 
grass and tree plantings 
congress set a goal of 40 million to 45 million acres in the crp 
by the end of 1990 about 282 million acres have been enrolled in 
the program 
according to the report the crp already has had a major impact 
on erosion and is currently saving 530 million tons of soil 
annually by 1995 it said the fully operational crp is expected to 
save 800 million tons of soil per year thus reducing total us 
erosion losses on nonfederal land by 15 percent 
robert j gray policy director for the private nonprofit 
american farmland trust said the usda figures on saving soil are 
impressive but that no one has been able to really spot check the 
fields to determine if the claims are correct

atop a 20foothigh downtown water fountain after 42 days and after 
raising less than 1000 for the homeless far short of his goal of 
1 million 
but david oferosky said wednesday it was worth the effort 
im proud of what i did and i would do it again he said 
oferosky 34 began his vigil at 1120 pm dec 13 scrambling 
up a ladder to his campsite atop the concrete fountain and into a 
tan tent pitched on a plywood floor 
a portable toilet stood outside the tent next to a propane flame 
that oferosky said symbolized his vigil and a bare evergreen tree 
that was his only christmas decoration 
inside he had a cot sleeping bag kerosene lamp and small 
propane heater which he said he used only occasionally 
a cellular telephone kept him in contact with the outside world 
for entertainment he had a television that eventually burned out a 
radio books and magazines and a minitrampoline 
oferosky said he suffered chills some nights and the pain of an 
abscessed tooth but mostly he fought boredom and loneliness 
you do have a lot of time to think believe me he said 
its like this is it your coffees not gonna get no hotter 
youve read that book read it again i never thought of giving 
up 
pas it was bad when the gangs were shooting each other but when 
they start attacking innoncent people its time for people to do

president bush who served as envoy to china 
during the rule of mao zedong will spend two days in beijing next 
month after visiting japan and may extend his travels to other 
countries the white house said thursday 
there was speculation south korea also would be on his itinerary 
i dont have full dates of the trip yet in terms of starting 
and ending but its clearly in an expanding mode here said white 
house press secretary marlin fitzwater i cant say for certain 
but this is not the final parameters of the trip 
on his first overseas trip bush will travel to japan for the 
feb 24 funeral of emperor hirohito he will spend feb 2526 in 
china on a working visit which traditionally has less pomp and 
ceremony than a fullblown state visit 
fitzwater left open the possibility bush would confer in tokyo 
with other foreign leaders 
obviously when a president goes to these kinds of events there 
are opportunities for bilateral meetings and obviously there are a 
lot of countries who would like to have them but we have to 
consider the time constraints involved in moving around in this 
case moving on to china and protocol restraints associated with the 
funeral fitzwater said 
describing the purpose of stopping in china fitzwater said it 
was essentially to reaffirm our relationship to offer support as 
they inch towards some openness in their society and some moves of 
economic reforms 
he said bush will meet with senior chinese leader deng xiaoping 
the president of course has very close ties with china having 
served there and having made two trips to china as vice president 
fitzwater said it just makes sense that while he has gone that 
far in that part of the world that he also stop in and pay a visit 
to china 
fitzwater said there was no slight to the soviet union in bushs 
decision to visit beijing before he goes to moscow 
the president has given every assurance of our continued 
cooperation toward the soviet union fitzwater said noting that 
one of bushs first telephone calls from the oval office was to 
president mikhail gorbachev there should be no inferences or 
special signals to the contrary 
the spokesman said bush has often said he will be prepared to 
meet with gorbachev when the time is ripe when theyve completed 
the foreign policy reviews that are necessary and when he bush 
thinks its appropriate 
in 1974 bush surprised thenpresident gerald ford by asking to 
serve as envoy to china instead of accepting an ambassadorship in 
britain or france an important coveted post like london or paris 
would be good for the resume but beijing was a challenge a journey 
into the unknown bush wrote later in his autobiography 
a little more than a year after taking the post bush was tapped 
to become director of the cia during his entire stay in beijing 
bush saw mao only twice once during a meeting with thensecretary 
of state henry a kissinger and again during a state visit by ford

a mother was arraigned thursday on 
charges of drugging her 9yearold son and forcing him and his 
12yearold sister into prostitution with as many as 80 adults 
police sought the childrens grandmother a 48yearold concord 
woman on a warrant charging her with pandering in the same case 
authorities believe the mother a 29yearold el cerrito woman 
used money collected for the sex acts to buy drugs police lt ray 
howard said neither the mother nor the grandmother were identified 
by name in order to protect the children 
a guardian whom the children live with called police last week 
and reported they had been forced to prostitute themselves while the 
family lived in richmond from 1986 to 1988 howard said 
the children said their mother gave them marijuana alcohol 
sleeping pills cocaine and methamphetamine in an effort to 
desensitize them to the sex acts howard said 
the boy told investigators that his mother forced him to have sex 
with 20 women and the girl said she was forced to have sex with 60 
men 
the mother is charged with 16 felony counts of forcing the 
children into lewd and lascivious acts two counts of pandering 
children for sex and one count of supplying crack cocaine to her son 
the thin woman with stringy shoulderlength hair appeared 
nervous when appearing before bay municipal court judge allen 
norris and said she did not have money to hire a lawyer norris 
referred her to the public defenders office 
the judge set her next court date for feb 2 and ordered her to 
remain at the county jail in martinez with no bail he also sealed 
the court records 
the woman has no previous criminal history said deputy district 
attorney brandon baum 
baum said he has prosecuted other parents for prostituting their 
children but this case is different 
i would say its unusual based on the businesslike manner in 
which the acts took place it was not a haphazard type of 
thing he said adding there were no signs that the mother took 
any precautions to protect the childrens physical health or guard 
them against sexually transmitted disease 
according to baum the grandmother allegedly aided and abetted 
in making arrangements for the acts to take place most occurred 
at the family home 
there are still a lot of unanswered questions about the 
grandmother her role here howard said 
authorities first investigated the mother in may after an alleged 
molestation of the girl there is a 25000 warrant outstanding for 
the arrest of the 33yearold man suspected in that case 
the countys child protective services took the brother and 
sister away from their mother because of neglect concerns and placed 
them in a foster home howard said 
two other girls ages 2 and 4 were taken from the home shortly 
after the may incident authorities said 
officials believe the childrens father was not involved in the 
alleged prostitution and wasnt living with them at the time howard 
said

springlike temperatures in the land of ice and 
snow have connoisseurs of cold whining and organizers of this 
weekends winter festival rejiggering their schedules 
in the 40s moaned wendell howard a longtime waukesha 
resident who came thursday to watch the us international snow 
sculpting competition a key part of the icebreaker winter funfest 
now thats not wisconsin in the winter especially not in 
january 
oh we like something more around zero or 20 below at least 
for a couple of weeks in january he said 
some of the worlds top snow sculpting teams were here for the 
festival which was preceded by rain and mild temperatures luckily 
icebreaker fest organizers thinking ahead saved huge blocks of 
snow from a latedecember storm 
according to the national weather service the average 
temperature in milwaukee for january was 286 degrees through 
wednesday about 10 degrees above normal the mercury hasnt dipped 
below zero in milwaukee once this winter the weather service said 
snowfall so far this winter was 125 inches only about a quarter 
of the normal total for the season and no one expects the shortfall 
to be made up by the end of winter 
the snow sculpting contest now in its fourth year draws 
thousands of spectators to gaze at the often highly detailed 
creations most more than 8 feet tall made from 10ton blocks of 
snow 
because of the warm weather icebreaker fest organizers are 
recommending sculptors work at night when temperatures are lower 
they also ordered wood chips to cover the muddied grounds and moved 
icesculpting events to a refrigerated ice house 
the snowsculpting compeition event has drawn teams from 10 
countries 
well i was all psyched up about coming here coming from 
england where it is usually a lot milder i expected to see lots of 
snow and some cold temperatures but so far its just like being 
back home said ron dutton of wolverhampton england a member of 
the threeman british team 
dutton who worked thursday on his teams sculpture said rain 
wednesday and the weather made sculpting his 10ton block of snow 
difficult competitors complain that the monthold blocks of snow 
are soft on the inside and brittle on the outside 
karin bach of the canadian womens team said the rain was 
changing sculptors strategy 
a lot of people will hold back on their details until friday 
night especially with this weather she said 
all the sculptors were inside you know everyone looked really 
dejected really disappointed she said thursday but were all 
back today and well still have some excellent works no matter what 
the weather 
gene kempfer director of the snow sculpting competition said 
the forecast for springlike temperatures this weekend forced him to 
move up the time of the judging a few hours saturday so that judges 
could see the finished products before the sun began melting them

the federal trade commission accused campbell 
soup co on thursday of deceiving its customers by advertising its 
soups as good for the heart without also advertising their salt 
content 
the commission requested an order from an administrative law 
judge requiring campbells to say in its ads how much sodium a soup 
contains if the company makes any claim that the soup can fight 
heart disease 
according to william macleod director of the commissions bureau 
of consumer protection campbells contended without substantiation 
that its soups as part of a diet low in fat and cholesterol may 
help reduce the risk of some forms of heart disease 
macleod singled out a twopage magazine ad used in the winter of 
19871988 but not used since that said campbells soups were high 
in fiber high in calcium when made with milk and low in fat and 
cholesterol 
a serving of regular chicken noodle or new special request 
with onethird less salt is low in fat and has just 15 milligrams 
of cholesterol and thats especially good to know because research 
tells us that a diet low in fat and cholesterol may help reduce the 
risk of some forms of heart disease the ad said 
macleod said what we want them to do is when they make that 
claim to disclose that the product has sodium because sodium has 
been associated with heart disease and certainly hypertension 
high blood pressure 
at the companys headquarters in camden nj campbells 
spokesman david hackney said we stand behind our advertising and 
we dont think its misleading because every can lists the sodium 
content all five billion of them 
we are the only major manufacturer that does that he said 
we feel we can substantiate through experts that a diet low in fat 
and low in cholesterol can reduce the risk of certain forms of heart 
disease 
in the trial before the administrative law judge the company 
will present experts who will discuss the whole salt issue and 
contest the commissions linkage of salt and high blood pressure 
hackney said 
macleod the ftc official said the commission was not trying to 
make advertisers disclose all shortcomings of their products only 
attributes that undermine their claims and thus constitute deception 
when omitted 
if they dont advertise the hearthealthiness of the soup this 
order wouldnt come into play he said 
not counting such variations as its chunky line or its two 
kinds of lowsodium soups campbells makes 70 different condensed 
soups in the familiar redandwhite cans 
soups that contain more than 500 milligrams of sodium per 
eightounce serving would come under the commissions proposed order 
that would include according to labels on the cans such soups 
as turkey vegetable at 710 milligrams and chicken noodle at 910 
milligrams of sodium a part of sodium chloride ordinary table salt 
campbells has an estimated twothirds of the 22 billion market 
for soups sold in stores 
bruce silverglade of the center for science and the public 
interest which petitioned the commission 11 months ago to act 
against not only the fat and cholesterol claim in the ad but also 
the fiber and calcium claims said were happy the agency has 
responded but disappointed that the other claims were not also 
the subject of federal complaints 
he said the government action means its fair to say anything 
with 500 milligrams per serving is a highsodium food were 
happy with the choice of 500 milligrams as a threshold 
not all doctors accept the proposition that salt at commonly 
found concentrations in us diets increases blood pressure 
studies show many people maintain normal blood pressure while eating 
varying amounts of salt while others for unknown reasons seem 
salt sensitive and their blood pressure can soar when salt 
intake goes up 
macleod acknowledging the dispute said the commission would 
rely heavily on the surgeon generals 1988 report on nutrition and 
health which said diets high in sodium clearly contribute to 
high blood pressure

filmmakers who outraged the government with their 
tv documentary on the shooting of three unarmed irish guerrilla 
suspects were cleared thursday by an inquiry into allegations of 
unscrupulous journalism 
the inquiry found the documentary flawed on two counts but 
concluded the filmmakers fully satisfied the requirements of 
balance fairness and impartiality 
the government said it continued to believe the documentary 
contained many serious and damaging inaccuracies and in a 
demonstration of its displeasure took the unusual step of publishing 
the points it made behind closed doors to the inquiry 
john wakeham majority leader in parliament noted that an 
inquest had ruled the killings were lawful and said of the 
inquirys report the government profoundly disagrees with it 
death on the rock was broadcast seven weeks after the 
shooting of the unarmed suspects by a british antiterrorist squad 
last march in gibraltar and provoked uproar by strongly suggesting 
that mairead farrell sean savage and daniel mccann were gunned down 
without getting a chance to surrender 
the government said the three were planting a car bomb in the 
british colony and the irish republican army acknowledged that the 
two men and one woman were in gibraltar on active service 
but the fact that they were unarmed and that no car bomb turned 
up provoked alarm that the security forces were taking too much 
latitude in the struggle against ira terrorism 
the foreign office appealed to the independent broadcasting 
authority which governs commercial tv to suppress the documentary 
as prejudicial to the inquest prime minister margaret thatcher 
publicly denounced it saying if ever you get trial by television 
or guilt by accusation that day freedom dies 
since then amnesty international has demanded a judicial inquiry 
into the killings and civil libertarians said the attack on the film 
is part of a broader government assault on media freedom 
when kenneth asquez the source of one of the films most 
provocative claims retracted his story under questioning at the 
inquest filmmaker thames television initiated the inquiry by lord 
windlesham and senior attorney richard rampton 
windlesham is a former member of mrs thatchers conservative 
party government and rampton specializes in defamation law thames 
said they were independent assessors with impeccable credentials 
that have not been challenged from any quarter during their 
fourmonth inquiry 
asquez a gibraltar bank clerk claimed he was bullied and 
offered money for a statement that he saw a security man standing 
over mccanns body pumping bullets into his head 
the investigators said viewers should have been told asquezs 
statement was unfilmed and unsigned but they did not fault its 
inclusion in the documentary and said the journalists did not 
bribe bully or misrepresent witnesses 
the other criticism was of an inappropriately worded line of 
commentary that the inquiry did not believe arose from any lack of 
scrupulousness the film said four witnesses saw the squad fire 
without warning whereas one witness was not in a position to see 
it had four witnesses saying the suspects made no sudden movements 
whereas two were not in a position to know that 
the inquiry rejected about 20 other allegations such as that the 
filmmakers knowingly broadcast falsehoods had preconceived 
theories sympathized with the ira and wanted to pin a murder charge 
on the british unit 
the government called it irresponsible to the point of 
dishonesty to include asquezs story in the film and pointed to 
other contradictions between the films narrative and evidence heard 
at the inquest 
the film said the suspects were under surveillance before 
entering gibraltar and that savages car could have been stopped at 
the border said the government the inquest heard otherwise 
a witness told the filmmakers she saw plainclothed men jump from 
a police car and shoot two suspects the inquest heard the car 
arrived after the shooting and contained uniformed policemen 
a government statement said the reporters failed to pursue the 
truth to clarify the facts or to present evidence impartially 
the inquiry upheld the governments right to make the strongest 
possible representations against programs deemed harmful to the 
public interest 
but the broadcasting authority must be prepared to withstand 
pressure however fierce and whatever the source it said

investigation into last years downing of an iranian jetliner by a 
us navy cruiser has been chosen as the next commander of the 
american naval force in the persian gulf 
pentagon officials said this week rear adm william m fogarty 
will probably assume command of the joint task force middle east in 
march he will replace rear adm anthony a less who will join the 
plans policy and operations staff of the chief of naval operations 
the force includes 24 warships 14 in the gulf and a 10ship 
aircraft carrier battle group in the arabian sea 
the appointment is the second toplevel command shuffle in recent 
months

policy at central command 
he headed the team of experts that investigated the shooting down

the strait of hormuz 
all 290 people aboard were killed when the warship destroyed the 
jetliner in the belief it was an iranian jet fighter 
fogartys inquiry found the stress of firsttime combat caused 
some vincennes crew members to misinterpret radar data on the jet 
the gulfbased force was recently cut from 15 to 14 ships in a 
move that us officials said reflected a lowering of tension since 
iraq and iran since they signed a ceasefire in august in their 
8yearold war 
the united states has maintained a permanent naval force in the 
persian gulf since 1949 but it was expanded in 1987 to protect 
usflag shipping 
navy ships now only monitor usflag vessels from a distance 
and six of 11 kuwaiti tankers that have sailed under the stars and 
stripes since mid1987 will soon revert to kuwaiti registry

a burglary suspect injured by police during 
a chase failed to show up in court after apparently cutting off his 
plaster body cast and leaving town on crutches police said 
the cast incased the man from ankles to midtrunk sandusky 
county jail administrator robert pollard said thursday 
it was a fullbody cast because he had a pin in his femur 
the bone extending from hip to knee said pollard it was designed 
to immobilize him 
the suspect robert chavez 19 was last seen saturday at his 
mobile home where he was recuperating from a broken hip and other 
injuries incurred when police shot him in the left leg and left 
buttocks during a chase nov 21 said sheriff david gangwer

count of felonious assault court records showed detectives went 
looking for him after he failed to show up for a court hearing 
tuesday gangwer said 
doctors told authorities in december chavez would have to wear 
the cast until march said gangwer 
but a resident of chavezs mobile home park told authorities he 
found a discarded body cast in a trash bin about two weeks ago the 
sheriff said adding that a pair of crutches was missing from the 
mobile home park 
were looking for a guy on crutches thats moving like a 
mole said a sheriffs detective who did not give his name

army troops razed or sealed seven palestinian 
houses thursday to try to quell the arab uprising and jewish 
settlers said they would punish stonethrowers themselves because 
the army wasnt doing its job 
we are not satisfied with the security situation even with the 
new decisions said settler official uri ariel referring to the 
armys tough new policy that includes firing plastic bullets at 
fleeing rioters or protesters blocking roads 
elyakim haetzni another settler leader said settlers would 
begin making their own arrests of palestinians and might shoot at 
those who stone jewish cars in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
in the occupied lands thursday soldiers shot and wounded 12 
youths in clashes with stonethrowers and shut down two schools 
where rocks were thrown arab reporters and hospital officials said 
the army said it had reports of four shooting injuries in gaza 
and the west bank city of nablus and was checking other reports 
it also reported troops demolished five houses in the west bank 
that belonged to families of palestinian suspects in firebomb 
attacks on israeli cars or soldiers 
four homes were bulldozed in the village of aqraba one was blown 
up in tulkarem and one house also was sealed in each of the two 
places an army spokeswoman said 
in tulkarem she said two soldiers were wounded in a firebomb 
attack in september the twostory house razed there belonged to 
mohammed haloub who has had one son deported during the 13month 
palestinian uprising and three other sons jailed arab reports said 
the united states and human rights organizations have criticized 
such house destructions saying they violate international law 
because the suspects are not tried 
israeli officials maintain that house demolitions are legal they 
are carried out under emegency laws adopted by the british rulers of 
mandatory palestine in 1945 when jews were fighting for the right to 
establish their own state 
an army official said wednesday that more than 200 palestinian 
homes have been demolished or sealed during the uprising 
last week officials announced that house demolitions 
previously used for firebomb suspects could now be directed 
against suspects in stonethrowing attacks that caused damage or 
injury 
the move was included in measures introduced in a renewed effort 
to stop the intefadeh the arabic word for uprising that is 
used for the revolt against israels occupation of the west bank and 
gaza strip 
at least 369 palestinians have been killed in the rebellion most 
by army gunfire fifteen israelis also have died 
the growing casualty rate has brought criticism of the army from 
leftwing israelis and leftwing groups began a weekend protest 
against jailing of palestinians without trial by setting up a tent 
camp outside the ketziot prison in southern israel 
abraham hess a survivor of the nazi holocaust taking part in the 
protest said on israeli radio that harsh actions against 
palestinians were humiliating israel 
you cannot forget that we were expelled from our own homes 
he said we must stop this blood this palestinian nation wants to 
live just as we did 
in jerusalem officials of the settler movement gush emunim or 
bloc of the faithful told reporters they would act against the 
uprising on their own since a 43day fast by eight settlers failed 
to gain stronger army actions 
we sent out an sos to the government that people were 
considering taking actions into their own hands haetzni said 
so we are no longer responsible for what happens 
he said the settlers sought legal advice and believed they had 
the right to arrest and in some cases shoot palestinian 
stonethrowers 
about 70000 jewish settlers live in enclaves among the 17 
million palestinian residents of the west bank and gaza strip which 
were captured from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
the defense ministry confirmed meanwhile that the army soon 
will release prominent plo activist faisal husseini who has been 
held without trial or specific charges for most of the past 21 
months 
husseini who was was arrested in july and ordered held for six 
months reportedly supports elections in the occupied lands if they 
are not linked to autonomy 
defense minister yitzhak rabin has called for elections as a way 
to start the peace process but a spokesman for rabin said 
husseinis release is not connected to his views on elections 
rabins plan called for elections and autonomy which have 
repeatedly been rejected by the plo as inconsistent with its demand 
for indepedence 
prime minister yitzhak shamir also turned down rabins plan and 
he said thursday no peace negotiations could begin until the 
palestinian uprising ends 
i think there should be no infefadeh it is not important how 
it stops he said in northern israel when it is quiet there 
will be negotiations

one in four american women gives birth by 
caesarean section and that rate appears to be leveling off after 
years of sharp increases a public interest group said thursday 
however the public citizen health research group estimated that 
more than half of the abdominal operations are unnecessary and that 
women should be encouraged more actively to deliver naturally 
the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists agreed 
that the csection rate appears to be leveling off but the 
professional organization rejected the reports claim that doctors 
are abusing the procedure 
the groups report analyzed data from 40 states and the district 
of columbia and found the rate of csection births rose 03 percent 
from 241 percent to 244 percent of all births from 1986 to 
1987 
the increase was the smallest annual rise in 12 years in a rate 
that has more than quadrupled since 1970 when 55 percent of all 
births were csections 
it looks like this is for real and its long overdue said 
dr sidney m wolfe coauthor of the report 
dr lynn silver the other author said the change is due to 
attention focused on the issue and women who are starting to ask 
the right questions about this procedure 
the group said nearly 51 percent of the 934000 surgical 
procedures commonly called csections performed in 1987 nationwide 
were unnecessary 
silver said that cost the nation more than 1 billion in health 
care costs and put thousands of women at higher risk needlessly 
silver said 
the report identified two hospitals where half or more of the 
babies born in 1987 were delivered by csection hialeah 
hospitaldade in florida 531 percent of its 2239 births and 
montgomery county memorial hospital in iowa 50 percent of its 56 
births 
wolfe said doctors and hospitals have an incentive to perform 
csections because they make more money on the procedure which is 
more complicated than natural delivery and requires a longer 
hospital stay for the mother he also said doctors like the 
convenience of scheduling a birth during working hours 
the report found that private forprofit hospitals had a higher 
csection rate averaging 24 percent and military and public health 
service hospitals had the lowest averaging 15 percent 
the report estimates that the optimal average us csection rate 
is about 12 percent the figure is based on an estimate of dr ej 
quilligan dean of the school of medicine at the university of 
california at irvine the estimate also is based on data from other 
countries and us hospitals that have tried to stop unnecessary 
surgery as well as clinical trials examining the usefulness of 
csections for women the report said 
the groups estimate of unnecessary csections was derived by 
comparing the 12 percent target rate with the actual rate 
but morton lebow a spokesman for the american college of 
obstetricians and gynecologists maintained that the report provides 
no reliable data to establish a correct rate for csections 
he said his group is concerned about the rate of csections 
and he noted the organization last fall strengthened its guidelines 
recommending that pregnant women who previously gave birth by 
csection deliver vaginally if there is no medical reason not to 
the report recommends that states require disclosure to maternity 
patients of csection rates for all doctors and hospitals in their 
area and second opinions for csections that are not emergencies 
it also says doctors should use more fetal tests to reduce the 
number of false diagnoses of fetal distress which often lead to 
unnecessary csections

l douglas wilder a grandson of slaves and 
the first black to win a statewide election in virginia began 
campaigning thursday to become the first elected black governor in 
the nation 
but the 58yearold former state legislator who defied experts 
four years ago by beating a white candidate to become lieutenant 
governor said he would not let race become an issue in the campaign 
i hope that it plays as little part in this electoral process 
as possible said wilder who is unopposed for the democratic 
nomination in a state with a 17 percent black population 
wilder told about 300 supporters at a downtown convention center 
and thousands of television viewers watching the rally statewide via 
satellite that he would campaign on a three for virginia program 
of permanent tax relief initiatives to combat illegal drugs and 
drugrelated crime and the creation of jobs and housing in poor 
rural areas 
wilder wrapped himself in the thriving economy cloak of 
democratic gov gerald l baliles who by law cannot succeed 
himself and said he would build on baliles accomplishments 
he also paid tribute to two pillars of political succcess in the 
state conservative fiscal policy and business leadership 
today because of virginias great natural and human resources 
and democratic fiscally conservative management we have provided 
improved services with budget surpluses he said 
as for business he said every governor of this state has 
relied on the keen insight of the virginia business community i 
intend to follow this tradition 
nowhere in his 15minute announcement did wilder make specific 
reference to the historic aspect of his campaign but he made a few 
comments about how times have changed and at a news conference 
afterward said he was aware of the interest because of his race 
forty years ago working my way through college and law school 
as a waiter and bus boy i never dreamed i would have the 
opportunity to run for governor of virginia he said 
wilders campaign theme included 
pushing to repeal the sales tax on food in future years and a 
promise to neither propose nor initiate new taxes but wilder would 
not rule out signing a tax hike if it becomes necessary 
cracking down on drug dealers 
expanding economic prosperity statewide a point made by 
wilders only challenger for the nomination state sen daniel w 
bird jr before he withdrew from the campaign tuesday 
virtually the entire state democratic leadership attended the 
rally but noticeably absent was us sen charles s robb wilder 
said robb baliles predecessor who was elected to the senate in 
november was busy in washington 
wilder has had differences in the past with both robb and 
baliles but the theme thursday was unity baliles introduced wilder 
as a man who does not flinch in cause of justice and does not 
hesitate in the search for progress 
wilder will be nominated at the state democratic convention in 
richmond in june his republican opponent will be decided in a june 
13 primary 
the gop has four contenders for the office former us sen paul 
s trible jr former attorney general j marshall coleman rep 
stanford e parris of northern virginia and del raymond r andy 
guest jr a state legislator from the shenandoah valley 
i will be prepared to deal with each of them wilder said

the number of antisemitic incidents rose to a 
fiveyear high in 1988 with reports of harassment incidents up 41 
percent and vandalism up 19 percent a jewish group said thursday 
abraham foxman national director of the antidefamation league 
of bnai brith said he could not point to a single factor for the 
increase but said there were stimulants such as neonazi 
skinheads the 50th anniversary of the start of the holocaust and 
developments in the middle east 
isnt it ironic that in our lifetime weve conquered space and 
even eradicated smallpox foxman said yet we have not developed 
a vaccine against the virus of hate 
an adl survey released here included nearly 1300 incidents 
reported by law enforcement authorities in 40 states the district 
of columbia and puerto rico there were no incidents reported in 10 
states said adl spokesman richard klein 
new york led the nation with 208 incidents half of those in new 
york city california had 121 florida 89 and new jersey 67 
we may never be able to completely eradicate mindless bigotry 
or the violence of hate us attorney general richard thornburgh 
wrote in a forward to the adl survey but we can pursue swift and 
sure prosecution of these crimes against the american dream 
the number of antisemitic harassment incidents such things as 
threats and assaults totaled 458 in 1988 up 41 percent from 324 in 
1987 
of those 325 were against jewish individuals including 21 
physical assaultsthe report cited a november attack against a 
yeshiva university student in new york city as being among the most 
brutal a gang of youths allegedly shouted antisemitic epithets as 
they beat robbed and stabbed the 19yearold who survived 
it was a record year for harassment incidents against jewish 
institutions in the 10 years the survey has been taken threats and 
other harassment incidents against institutions were reported in 133 
cases up about 10 percent from previous years the group said 
in the category of vandalism against individuals and 
institutions there were a total of 823 incidents reported in 1988 
up from 694 the previous year most of those were antisemitic 
graffiti and cemetery desecrations but there were more serious 
incidents such as a pipe bomb exploding inside a florida synagogue 
and an arson fire that destroyed a brooklyn synagogue in september 
an unusually large number of vandalism incidents were reported in 
the south 172 cases in 12 states up from 115 in 1987 where 
there are mostly smaller jewish populations the report said 
geographically the northeast had the greatest number of 
incidents 411 in 11 states and the district of columbia while 
the west was the only region to report a decrease figures there 
dropped 7 percent from 157 incident to 146 in six states incidents 
in the midwest rose slightly from 85 in 1987 to 92 in 1988 
other disturbing statistics showed that of the 124 people 
arrested for antisemitic acts in 1988 approximately 90 percent 
were under 21 
foxman said the 1988 survey makes it clear we have a long way 
to go and still have much to do 
he called for continued efforts by law enforcement authorities to 
apprehend those who practice hate crimes better antibias education 
programs for youths in schools churches and afterschool programs 
and strict enforcement of antibias legislation which is now in 
effect in 43 states 
as for the cause of the increase in bias incident reports foxman 
said we cannot so easily say this is the cause and this is the 
effect but he noted some specific stimulants including 
the uprising by palestinians in the west bank and gaza which 
began in late 1987 foxman said he believes antisemites used the 
situation to carry out acts of hatred under the guise of a 
political conflict there were 117 incidents were linked to the 
uprising 
a proliferation of neonazi skinhead gangs who preach violence 
and hatred against blacks hispanics jews asians and homosexuals 
they were said to be responsible for 41 antisemitic incidents last 
year 
publicity marking the 50th anniversary of kristallnacht in 
germany believed by many to have been the start of the nazi 
holocaust more than 60 antisemitic incidents were reported during 
the weeklong observation in november 
the report said there was a significant increase in the number of 
american colleges reporting antisemitic incidents from 14 
campuses in 1987 to 38 campuses in 1988 the 54 incidents at the 38 
schools included vandalism threats harassment and assault

a private group lobbying to stem the flow of 
illegal immigrants into the united states on thursday proposed 
charging 2 to enter the country and using the money to tighten 
border security 
the estimated 500 million to 600 million a year that could be 
raised from the fee the federation for american immigration reform 
said could finance intensified border patrols and the replacement 
of 28 miles of metal fence that has become so dilapidated it cannot 
withstand the onslaught of humanity 
everyone has the right to lock his own back door those who 
ignore the lock and enter without permission are guilty of breaking 
and entering the group said in a report that also proposed 
building 25 miles of sunken concrete fences in san diego and el 
paso texas where the border patrol makes 70 percent of its 1 
million arrests annually 
the nonprofit groups proposals called ten steps to securing 
americas borders went substantially beyond plans by the 
immigration and naturalization service to build a 2 million 
4milelong 14footwide ditch along the san diego border the 
ditch intended to stop vehicular traffic is expected to be 
completed by the fall 
one author of the report retired border patrol chief roger p 
brandemuehl said the ins ditch would not stop people trying to 
sneak across the border on foot 
his organization proposed instead 12foot sunken concrete 
retaining walls topped by 8foot metal fences along the san diego 
and el paso border segments 
the 28 miles of metal fence currently in place along the southern 
border is so dilapidated that it could not keep a small child out 
of a basketball court said patrick burns the groups assistant 
director 
it simply cannot withstand the onslaught of humanity he 
said it is attacked by everything from blow torches to 
bulldozers 
the user fee would provide 200 million to build the new barriers 
plus another 200 million for more border patrol agents and 
surveillance equipment in isolated areas said patrick burns the 
groups assistant director 
burns said that anyone who cant afford two bucks shouldnt be 
crossing an international boundry and pointed out that people 
flying into the united states already pay a 10 fee 
the group said 90 percent of the arrests of illegal aliens occur 
along just 200 miles of the 2000mile southern border 
the report was written with the cooperation of the ins which 
said through spokesman verne jervis that it was studying the 
study 
jervis said ins currently has 4000 border patrol agents mostly 
along the border with mexico he acknowledged that the metal fence 
is poorly maintained and that its easy to cut its easy to 
penetrate 
he acknowledged that a user fee might enable ins to hire more 
inspectors at border crossings thereby shortening the often 
threetofour hour wait 
the federations advisory committee includes former attorney 
general william french smith exsen walter d huddleston dky 
former colorado gov richard lamm and john v lindsay former mayor 
of new york city 
both the federations proposal and the ins plan drew criticism 
from the league of united latin american citizens 
that organizations national political director arnoldo torres 
said physical barriers will only exacerbate tension and problems 
along the border 
torres said the federation was trying to play to the fear of 
illegal immigration 
he said his organization has send president bush and attorney 
general dick thornburgh telegrams urging them to reconsider the 
4mile ditch plan 
torres said many hispanic leaders in san diego have approached 
his group to support civil disobedience on the physical 
construction of that ditch 
there is that strong a conviction of hispanics along the border 
that they were willing to do that he said

the finance minister promised a parliamentary 
committee thursday there will be no coverup of an insider trading 
scandal involving a close friend of president francois mitterrand 
at a hearing of the national assemblys finance committee 
finance minister pierre beregovoy said the government will order a 
criminal investigation in the case regardless of the conclusions of 
a report expected next week from the commission that oversees 
operations of frances stock exchange 
this affair will not be covered up and i think thats a change 
in comparison with a slightly earlier period beregovoy said in a 
veiled reference to political scandals the socialists say were left 
unresolved under previous conservative governments 
commission reports usually are not made public but mitterrand 
issued a statement late thursday saying he and other top government 
officials had agreed to make an exception and release the report 
being prepared in this case 
french american and swiss investigators have been looking into 
suspicious trading in shares of the us firm triangle industries 
inc just before it was acquired last fall by the stateowned 
french metals producer pechiney sa 
some investors made quick profits by buying triangle stock at 
about 10 a share and selling them a few days later following 
pechineys takeover bid nov 21 at 56 a share these investors 
include rogerpatrice pelat a retired businessman who is perhaps 
mitterrands oldest and closest friend 
pelat has refused comment on suggestions he benefitted from 
inside information and says he wont say anything until after the 
stock exchange commission makes its report 
the scandal has led to the resignation of beregovoys chief of 
staff alain boublil who said he quit so he could defend his 
innocence more vigorously 
both the communist party and the conservative rally for the 
republic party have been calling for an independent parliamentary 
inquiry 
alain juppe secretarygeneral of the rally for the republic had 
told reporters he was very worried about the risk of a coverup 
this affair is more serious than it looks juppe said it 
raises questions about a certain conception of politics and its 
relations with morality if the general suspicion of corruption 
continues to weigh on the political community this is not 
acceptable 
french newspaper reports say the us securities and exchange 
commission told its french counterpart it was looking into purchases 
of about 220000 shares in triangle just before the takeover bid 
only sketchy information about most of the buyers has become 
public and there has been little more than speculation about who 
might have leaked valuable tips about the imminent takeover bid 
my personal conviction is that there was insider trading but 
im completely unable to prove it jean gandois president of 
pechiney said in an interview on french radio thursday 
gandois defended the high price pechiney paid for triangle the 
parent firm of american national can saying it was worth it to 
establish the french company as world leader in metal packaging 
beregovoy told the parliamentary committee that pechineys 
purchase is a good deal and the price paid corresponds to the 
american market 
the finance minister said he had asked all his aides who had 
advance knowledge of the takeover on their honor if they leaked 
the information and the answer on their part was that no 
indiscretion had been committed

threatening regional peace from within iraq and asked a un envoy 
to pressure baghdad to stick to terms of the ceasefire in the 
persian gulf war 
iranian prime minister hussein musavi told visiting un envoy 
jan eliasson that iran will spare no effort to secure a 
permanent peace treaty with iraq according to the official islamic 
republic news agency monitored in nicosia 
eliasson un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellars 
special emissary arrived in tehran on monday seeking to breathe new

war that left an estimated 1 million people dead 
the un envoy was scheduled to visit baghdad on friday to meet 
senior leaders and seek ways of fully putting into effect the un 
security councils ceasefire resolution 
iraqi information minister latif nussayif jasim said wednesday 
that any spark on the tense border where both sides still have 
large numbers of troops could trigger new hostilities 
president saddam hussein of iraq alleged earlier this month that 
iran was massing troops along the 730mile border between the two 
countries 
un military observers say the ceasefire is holding despite 
clais of violations by both sides but the stalemate in peace talks 
appears to have hardened 
the iranian news agency quoted musavi as saying we are 
concerned about dangers threatening the accomplishment of peace from 
inside iraq and believe that an international effort is needed to 
make the baghdad regime understand that it should respect 
international agreements for the cause of peace 
the report did not elaborate on the alleged threat 
musavi stressed iraq still occupies about 260 square miles of 
iranian border territory and refuses to withdraw its troops the 
agency said 
how can we believe that iraq will abide by the articles of the 
un resolution while part of our country is still under 
occupation he was quoted as saying 
the agency quoted eliasson as saying we expect both sides to 
pave the way for peace by taking positive steps

communist authorities in the soviet republic of 
lithuania would welcome a visit to the roman catholic stronghold by 
pope john paul ii but moscow continues to oppose the idea 
lithuanias cardinal said thursday 
cardinal vincentas sladkevicius in rome for talks with the pope 
said he raised the issue of a papal visit in a meeting this week in 
moscow with an official in the governments council for religious 
affairs 
at this time the government of moscow is very much against a 
visit of the pope the 68yearold cardinal said in an interview 
with the associated press 
he said sergei kuznetsov head of the soviet department on 
catholic affairs answered with an objection saying why isnt 
the vatican taking steps to meet the easts desires why isnt the 
pope taking steps to improve relations 
sladkevicius said the kremlin position differed from that of 
lithuanias communist party chief algirdas brazauskas who 
indicated at a recent meeting in kaisiadorys that the local 
government was very much in favor of a papal visit 
the cardinal said the lithuanian government is still very 
dependent on moscow and could not clear the way for a papal visit 
on its own 
the polishborn pontiff frequently has expressed the desire to 
travel to the soviet union but insisted he would go only if 
permitted to visit his flock throughout the country 
he has said that at least on two occasions he has been refused 
permission to visit lithuania 
lithuania an independent country before world war ii was 
occupied by the soviet union in 1940 and has been viewed as a 
stronghold of nationalism sladkevicius said about 80 percent of 
lithuanias 35 million people are roman catholics 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev is scheduled to make an 
official visit to rome in november and the vatican has said the 
pope is open to a meeting with him such a meeting has been 
portrayed as a possible prelude to the first ever visit by a pope to 
the soviet union 
sladkevicius who was confined to virtual house arrest from 1959 
until 1982 was elevated to cardinal in june by the pope he said 
the situation of the catholic church in lithuania had improved under 
gorbachev but that catholics are still secondclass citizens 
if the natural desire for independence becomes realized then 
religious problems will resolve themselves he said speaking 
slowly in english in the interview in a tiny hotel room 
on the positive side he said the soviet government recently 
decided to allow bishop juliajonas steponavicius to resume his 
official duties as apostolic administrator of vilnius after nearly 
28 years of internal exile 
sladkevicius said the government on feb 5 will return the 
vilnius cathedral which was converted into a state art gallery in 
1950 to the church on the same day a catholic magazine 
believers world will start up in vilnius 
st casimirs church which has been a museum since 1962 will be 
returned to the church in march he said 
we are evaluating the changes they are very good but we are 
not certain about the future said sladkevicius 
the nation was faithful to its catholic faith but only part of 
the nation could practice openly now the obstacles have been 
removed he said 
sladkevicius is one of two cardinals in the soviet union 
julijans vaivods of latvia was elevated by john paul in 1983

drug abusers who inject cocaine are more likely to 
catch aids infections from the practice than those who shoot heroin 
researchers found in a study of 633 addicts in san francisco 
injection of cocaine promotes more sharing of hypodermic needles 
than heroin injection because cocaines briefer euphoria requires 
more doses up to 10 a day the researchers said 
the cocaine association is news this is the first time its 
ever been reported said dr richard e chaisson formerly of the 
university of california at san francisco and now of johns hopkins 
university school of medicine in baltimore 
chaisson and fellow researchers studied 633 heroin addicts 
enrolled in drug treatment programs in san francisco from may 1986 
to july 1987 about 60 percent of the addicts also injected cocaine 
seventyseven of the addicts in the study or 12 percent were 
infected with hiv the virus that causes aids the researchers 
reported in fridays journal of the american medical association 
among addicts who did not use cocaine at all 8 percent were 
infected chaisson said 
addicts who injected cocaine once a month had a 15 percent hiv 
infection rate those who injected it weekly had a 21 percent 
infection rate and those who injected it daily had a 28 percent 
infection rate chaisson said 
there were striking increases in infection rate with increasing 
use of the drug chaisson said in a telephone interview wednesday 
that was not seen with heroin use in a similar pattern 
intravenous drug abusers account for 20 percent of the more than 
83000 adult cases of aids reported to the national centers for 
disease control since 1979 experts believe hiv infection is spread 
among this group through blood residue on shared needles 
the study found that if addicts used cocaine regularly they were 
more likely to share needles with many people increased usage was 
associated with a greater likelihood the addict had injected cocaine 
at a shooting gallery where people buy drugs and rent needles 
chaisson said 
if someone goes to a shooting gallery they pay a dollar and 
get a syringe they have no idea how many people have used that 
needle he said 
chaisson said the government estimates that 900000 people in 
this country abuse drugs by injecting them he said he believes 
anywhere from 100000 to 500000 people inject cocaine less than 10 
percent of all people using the drug 
heroin is not the only problem or even the major problem 
chaisson said cocaine has emerged as a more serious problem than 
heroin in part because methadone is available to control heroine 
abuse but nothing is available to control cocaine 
chaisson said 95 percent of the subjects were able to reduce 
their heroin use with methadone a drug substitute used in treatment 
programs to reduce the craving for heroin 
a quarter of the addicts in the study who took cocaine began 
using it after they had begun treatment with methadone chaisson 
said 
blacks had a disproportionately high number of aids virus 
infections in the study chaisson said fortyeight of 188 blacks 
were infected a rate of 26 percent compared with 20 of 328 whites 
or 6 percent and nine of 94 hispanics or 10 percent the study 
found 
the reason blacks have a disproportionately high rate of aids 
virus infections is unknown the study said however it found that 
blacks used cocaine in higher proportion than whites researchers 
said more frequent injections may put blacks and hispanics at higher 
risk than whites

senate committees working thursday to fill 
vacancies at president bushs cabinet table examined one nominees 
relationships to defense contractors heard another defend bushs 
flexible freeze budget plan and got suggestions from a third on 
how he will manage americas open spaces 
as the process unfolded former republican sen john tower of 
texas told the senate armed services committee the 763777 he made 
as a defense consultant over the past three years will not influence 
his actions if he is confirmed as bushs secretary of defense 
at other hearings 
michael boskin selected to be bushs chief economic adviser 
told the senate banking committee he believes spending cuts can be 
made in defense and health care spending and that bush will be ready 
with specific flexible freeze proposals when he addresses a 
joint meeting of congress on feb 9 
former republican rep manuel lujan jr told the senate energy 
and natural resources committee that he views the job of secretary 
of the interior as one of stewardship and will if confirmed 
try to enlist thousands of volunteers as helpers in the national 
park and fish and wildlife systems 
the energy panel voted to endorse the lujan nomination and sent 
it to the full senate where a vote is expected next wednesday 
tower a former armed services committee chairman told that 
panel congress should slow down the revolving door through which 
some top defense officials pass on the way to highpaying civilian 
jobs in the defense industry 
pentagon officials should be barred tower said from profiting 
unfairly unethically or illegally or inordinately if they move 
between pentagon and industry jobs 
tower had little to offer on how in a period of increasingly 
tight budgets he would act to shape such major procurement programs 
as those for the strategic defense initiative the mx and midgetman 
missiles special operation forces or the goal of building a 
600ship navy 
nothing is sacred tower said adding that specific decisions 
must await the conclusion of a review ordered by bush 
senators opened the session with a detailed review of towers 
relations with defense contractors since 1985 when he ended a 
24year senate career that included a 198184 stint as armed 
services chairman 
he said he cut all financial ties to the defense industry on dec 
1 one day after learning he was under serious consideration for the 
defense post he said he did not stand to gain from the prosperity 
of any former associate 
but tower was told by chairman sam nunn dga that his 
situation did pose difficulty in that he had been involved with as 
many as seven major defense contractors all of whom play roles in 
military procurement 
tower promised to bend over backwards to avoid favoring his 
former associates 
elsewhere at the capitol boskin faced questions about how 
spending programs might be affected by bushs budget plans the 
stanford university professor was bushs principal economic adviser 
during last years presidential campaign and was the author of the 
flexible freeze idea 
that idea to keep federal spending level while increasing or 
cutting specific programs was cited often by candidate bush when 
asked how he planned to augment a variety of domestic programs while 
still lowering the budget deficit without raising taxes 
if there are no new taxes that means there will have to be 
some massive cuts in the federal budget said sen larry pressler 
rsd who repeatedly asked boskin to specify three or four 
areas where spending reductions should be made 
boskin who emphasized that bush had not made any final decisions 
on the budget said he would personally favor reducing the size of 
growth in the defense budget and in the governments health care 
costs 
if i was looking for large savings they would have to come 
from areas where there is large spending boskin said 
president reagans final 115 trillion budget for the fiscal 
year which begins next oct 1 did propose cuts in medicare and 
medicaid spending but it sought to boost defense spending authority 
by 2 percent above the rate of inflation 
bush is expected to seek similar cuts in health care costs and is 
likely to trim defense spending to provide funds for areas that he 
wants to increase to fulfull his campaign promises 
lujan bushs choice to be interior secretary quoted the late 
president franklin delano roosevelt in saying the country will 
not be a good place to live in unless it is a good place for all of 
us to live in 
we want to be known as a team who passed on these national 
treasures in better condition than we found them he said 
meanwhile the senate agriculture committee postponed a scheduled 
hearing on clayton k yeutters nomination to be secretary of 
agriculture a routine report on the fbi investigation of yeutter 
who served as us trade representative in the reagan 
administration had not yet been made available to the panel a 
spokesman said

the united states is a handsdown loser when it 
comes to mathematics education and needs major reforms including 
voluntary national standards to upgrade math achievement says a 
report released thursday 
three out of four us students leave high school without 
mastering enough mathematics to cope with either job demands or the 
expectations of colleges said the report by the national research 
council an arm of the national academy of sciences and the national 
academy of engineering 
the report everybody counts says piecemeal local efforts to 
correct the nations math teaching deficiencies are totally 
inadequate and calls for forwardlooking national standards to be 
adopted by local school systems 
a recent surge of studies and books has raised concern over the 
nations mathematical skills with another major study an 
international survey of math and science performance due next week 
from the educational testing service 
thursdays report reflects the consensus of 70 teachers 
administrators researchers executives parents and government 
officials who spent three years studying math education from 
kindergarten through graduate school 
the council concludes that teaching must move away from 
pencilandpaper techniques and memorization toward realistic 
problemsolving and early use of computers and calculators which 
the report said have had virtually no impact on instruction 
despite their great potential to enrich it 
the group said that teachers should be moderators not lecturers 
and that students should take math every year they are in school 
the authors point to two approaches they say wont work 
the back to basics movement favored by those who think of 
math as an anchor in a sea of change it isnt sufficient to 
simply do better on traditional programs shirley hill chairman 
of the mathematical sciences education board told a news 
conference math changes the curriculum must keep up we must be 
contemporary 
the topdown japanese approach of enforcing a national 
gradebygrade curriculum while nations adopting such an approach 
have beaten us handsdown the report said the technique would 
be impractical in the united states 
the report sasy that new math was imposed from the top down 
and fell flat because teachers and parents were not involved in the 
process the council suggests instead what it calls an augmented 
grass roots approach voluntary flexible standards with a broad 
base of public support 
a major step toward that goal is expected next month when the 
national council of teachers of mathematics publishes curriculum 
and evaluation standards for school mathematics the research 
council called the upcoming study the first effort ever to 
establish national expectations for school mathematics and said 
draft copies are already influencing textbook publishers and testing 
organizations 
in addition to low math achievement and a stagnant math 
curriculum the authors of everybody counts noted a number of 
other problems 
the shortage of qualified math teachers is more serious than in 
any other area of us education and affects all levels from 
elementary to graduate school the shortage of minority math 
teachers is particularly acute 
the conventional wisdom is that some people are just bad at 
math but in other industrialized nations all students are expected 
to master a level of math attained only by the best us students 
the result is that us firms are at a competitive disadvantage 
us industry spends as much annually on remedial math education 
as is spent on math education in schools colleges and universities 
combined

a panel headed by former secretary of state 
edmund muskie recommended thursday a broad tax increase as part of a 
plan to balance the federal budget saying new taxes will be 
unavoidable 
the panel also recommended increasing spending on programs 
helping children living in poverty by 2 billion a year for five 
years 
on national defense it recommended scaling back goals for early 
deployment of the strategic defense initiative the star wars 
nuclear space shield program and called for a temporary moratorium 
on new military procurement 
the report called america tomorrow the choices we face was 
sent to the white house and other officials of the bush 
administration 
it was the result of a nearly yearlong project sponsored by the 
center for national policy a public policy research organization 
based in washington 
members of the centers steering committee for the project all 
of whom signed the report included paul a volcker former chairman 
of the federal reserve board adm bobby inman former no 2 
official at the cia sally ride former astronaut former sen 
charles mcc mathias jr of maryland douglas a fraser former 
head of the united auto workers donald m stewart president of the 
college board and isabel v sawhill of the urban institute 
the report concludes that massive foreign borrowing and a decline 
in domestic saving and investment are serious longterm threats to 
american living standards it recommends a flexible fiveyear plan 
to balance the budget and balance foreign trade figures by fiscal 
1994 
it recommends spending cuts and small revenue increases for the 
first year followed by a move to a twoyear budget cycle in fiscal 
1991 it would add tax increases amounting to 25 billion over each 
of the following four years 
new taxes will be unavoidable not only to achieve a net 
deficit reduction of 100 billion but also to cover infrastructure 
problems the report said 
it recommends several possibilities including raising income tax 
rates by 1 percent a year for four years a 25 cent increase in the 
gasoline tax an acrosstheboard tax on energy raising tobacco and 
alcohol taxes taxing social security benefits as income 
eliminating or limiting the tax deduction for home mortgage 
interest and taxing employer contributions for medical insurance 
there is no question that the nation must confront the issue of 
which existing taxes to increase or what new taxes to create the 
report said 
the report said child poverty rates have been rising in recent 
years and seem likely to continue one quarter of american children 
under age 6 now live in poverty and children now represent the 
poorest age group in the nation it said 
it recomends adding 2 billion each year to existing and 
experimental poverty programs directed at young children as an 
investment in the prevention of costly longterm problems 
on defense it said the nation should take advantage of a new 
relationship with the soviet union by proposing to reduce the 
conventional arms forces in europe on both sides down to a point 
equal to approximately 50 percent of current nato levels phased in 
over eight years 
it calls for continuing strategic arms control talks and 
modernizing the landbased missile force by development of a small 
mobile singlewarhead intercontinental ballistic missile 
it calls for scaling back deployment goals for star wars while 
continuing research and arms talks 
the report advocates pentagon management reforms and would impose 
a series of procurement moratoriums while review is under way

an israeli official said egypt backed away from 
a demand to take control sunday over a disputed beachfront after 
israel warned that such a move would jeopardize talks on the strip 
the directorgeneral of israels foreign ministry reuven merhav 
told israel radio that egypt reconsidered its demand to take control 
of the area known as taba this weekend because of pressure from 
israel and the united states washington is mediating the talks 
israel has insisted that decisions about access for israeli 
tourists and ownership of a luxury hotel and resort village at taba 
be decided with the transfer issue the resorts are now owned by 
israelis 
the order that was to be published sunday by egypt will 
apparently be changed merhav said we relayed a message to the 
egyptians that a step like this would disrupt the negotiations 
taba a 250acre beach area on the red sea has been a subject of 
dispute since israel refused to hand it back to egypt in 1982 at 
that time israel withdrew from the rest of the sinai peninsula 
under terms of the israelegyptian peace treaty 
last november an international arbitration panel delineated the 
border putting taba in egyptian territory but the panel was not 
empowered to decide the final boundary line which egypt and israel 
were to work out in their own talks 
nabil araby egypts chief negotiator on taba on wednesday said 
the land should be returned to egypt on sunday since israel and 
egypt agreed to adhere to the arbitration ruling 60 days after it 
was handed down 
but israel radio said egypt had backed away from its demand 
because of israeli concern the move would give the egyptian tourism 
ministry broad ownership rights over the hotel before the question 
of ownership was settled 
instead israel radio said egypt plans to issue an order 
authorizing the tourism ministry to negotiate for the hotels 
purchase

guards on thursday kept an inspection team from 
entering the construction site of a controversial us military 
housing project that local officials have been fighting a city 
official said 
mayor kiichiro tomino of zushi and 10 other people went to the 
wooded area about 30 miles southwest of tokyo to check construction 
of more than 850 apartment units for us navy personnel and their 
families said soichi takagi a zushi official 
city officials have tried to stop the project saying it would 
jeopardize one of the few remaining wilderness tracts in the tokyo 
area 
japanese guards employed by us military authorities locked 
the gates and refused entry to the city officials saying the city 
should have obtained a permission from proper authorities takagi 
said 
tomino argued unsuccessfully that zushi city has legal authority 
to conduct inspections of the 717acre project and surveys of the 
nearby hills takagi said the city of 58000 people borders on the 
naval port city of yokosuka 
the ikego hills have escaped ravages of development around the 
metropolis because they have been offlimits to civilians for the 
past 52 years 
under the usjapan security treaty japan provides land and 
some facilities together with part of the costs for stationing us 
servicemen in japan about 64000 us servicemen are based in japan

colorado will shut down the federal 
governments rocky flats nuclear weapons plant in may unless a new 
site is found for its hazardous wastes gov roy romer said thursday 
the plant about 16 miles from denver is considered a critical 
part of the nations network of nuclear weapons factories it is the 
only plant capable of processing plutonium for nuclear weapons and 
is the only fabricator of triggers for nuclear warheads 
radioactive waste from rocky flats used to be shipped north for 
storage at the idaho national engineering laboratory in october 
however idaho sealed its borders against the shipments forcing a 
buildup of waste at the rocky flats complex 
our regulations allow only a limited quantity of wastes 1600 
cubic yards to be stored temporarily on site romer told the 
senate governmental affairs committee at the present rate of 
waste generation the plant will exceed this limit sometime in may 
1989 
we must find a solution by may or we arent going to have 
production at rocky flats romer said adding that he doesnt want 
to close the plant but that it is an action i will take if i have 
to 
romer said another temporary waste storage site far away from 
population centers must be found quickly 
a forced shutdown of rocky flats would aggravate a growing 
problem for the federal government which last spring lost its only 
nuclear reactor capable of making tritium a perishable gas vital to 
making nuclear weapons that reactor at the savannah river plant 
near aiken sc was closed for safety and technical reasons and is 
not expected to be restarted before late 1989 
rocky flats borders a metropolitan area with 15 million people 
the plant has just begun the job of gradually reopening the building 
that reprocesses plutonium it was closed last october after some 
workers were contaminated 
romer said he supports storing the wastes at the unopened waste 
isolation pilot plant near carlsbad nm 
i think that ultimately is a safe facility he said 
idaho gov cecil andrus complained to the committee about delays 
in opening the new mexico facility 
andrus said the energy department promised in 1973 it would 
remove by 1980 waste temporarily stored in idaho that timetable was 
pushed back several times until the state finally was told the waste 
would be moved out in 1988 when it wasnt the state drew the line 
at 24 million cubic feet of material 
we have been lied to for the last time andrus said idaho 
has kept its part of a difficult bargain but the federal government 
and the department of energy has not kept its word to us 
andrus romer and ohio gov richard celeste all urged the senate 
panel to make sure the government didnt turn the nuclear bomb 
plants in their states into dumps of last resort or national 
sacrifice zones 
in response to questioning by the committee chairman sen john 
glenn dohio an environmental protection agency official said 
there may be some contamination at nuclear plants that is so 
severe removing it would be more dangerous than fencing it in as a 
sort of isolation area

texas agriculture commissioner jim hightower 
wont be allowed to make an end run around an intercontinental trade 
dispute and sell hormonefree beef from texas to the european 
economic community a federal official said thursday 
its not going to happen said roger bolton a spokesman for 
the us trade representatives office even as officials of the 
texas agriculture department and the eec continued working on ways 
to open trade between texas beef producers and european importers 
we see no legal ability for them to stop it unless they impose 
a formal embargo hightower said were taking a states rights 
position if ollie north can go run a private war with the applause 
of the administration why are they getting in the way of a few 
cattlemen who want to make a sale to our very best customers 
ella krucoff spokeswoman for sir roy denman head of eec 
delegation in washington said the eec was in active contact with 
the state of texas we are interested in maintaining the trade we 
want that trade to be in hormonefree meat 
the european economic community has banned imports of us beef 
and beef products because the meat worth about 100 million in 
sales contains growth hormones that the eec contends are a health 
threat the united states disputes those claims and retaliated by 
setting about 100 million worth of higher tariffs on various common 
market products 
ms krucoff said the eec would be willing to accept certification 
of the meats purity from texas authorities if the federal 
government is not willing to certify the meat as hormonefree 
hightower said the texas agency has asked acting agriculture 
secretary peter myers to accept a provision with the eec to certify 
beef from texas and other states for export but weve had no 
communication back 
the us trade representatives office contends there is no way 
texas can verify the meat as hormonefree thus effectively 
prohibiting its export

the troubled peach bottom nuclear plant will 
use everything from less comfortable chairs to a new shift rotation 
to prevent a recurrence of control room operators sleeping on duty 
officials said thursday 
about 60 reporters were handed hardhats goggles and tiny 
radiation monitors as philadelphia electric co operator of the 
dormant plant on the susquehanna river conducted its first media 
tour of the facility 
the utility is trying to convince the nuclear regulatory 
commission that things have changed since the nrc ordered the two 
peach bottom reactors shut down in march 1987 because of widespread 
sleeping and horseplay on the job by control room workers 
the problems resulted in a 125 million fine largest in nrc 
history operator negligence was so pervasive that the commission 
also levied fines ranging from 500 to 1000 against 33 current and 
former workers for sleeping andor inattention to duty 
to combat the catnaps plant officials said they have replaced 
comfortable highbacked chairs with lowbacked models 
shift rotations have been changed so that operators work a week 
of days followed by a week of an afternoonevening shift and then 
work the overnight the rotation which includes days off used to 
go in the reverse order 
the moves are part of a plant shakeup that also includes new top 
managers and revamped training courses for control room personnel 
peach bottom officials said they hope to get nrc permission to 
restart the plant in late march or april 
dave woodrow a control room shift supervisor said the shutdown 
has been a burden on myself and my family and that operators 
were eager to start again we would like to prove to the public 
that we are good operators he said 
woodrow said sloppiness in the control room may have arisen 
partly because philadelphia electric was devoting so much attention 
to construction of the limerick ii nuclear plant in suburban 
philadelphia 
it was a feeling we were being forgotten he said 
efforts to improve worker morale were reflected in improvements 
in plant equipment and even in the distribution of goldlettered 
pens that proclaimed i work at peach bottom atomic power station 
and im proud of it 
onthejob napping was not the only problem at the plant since 
the shutdown the nrc also cited deficiencies in peach bottoms 
security force which has recently been replaced and said the 
plant needed to do a better job cleaning up surface contamination 
philadelphia electric has had to pay about 150 million for 
replacement power because of the outage and chairman joseph 
paquette said thursday our credibility certainly has been 
damaged 
but paquette added were obviously approaching the finish 
line we did not want the public to come in until we were sure we 
had something youd be impressed with 
after submitting background information to plant officials the 
group of reporters touring the plant was shown the control turbine 
and fuel storage rooms stopping several times to step into phone 
boothsized radiation detectors 
peach bottom is concentrating on getting its 14yearold unit 2 
into operation first a second unit would be restarted sometime 
afterward

michael boskin author of president bushs 
flexible freeze approach to balancing the budget without 
increasing taxes defended the proposal thursday and said defense 
and health care are two areas where he believes spending cuts can be 
made 
boskin nominated to be bushs chief economic adviser said the 
president would provide specific details on how the flexible freeze 
will work when he unveils his budget recommendations during an 
address to a joint session of congress on feb 9 
during the presidential campaign the flexible freeze became 
bushs allpurpose answer to queries on how he planned to increase 
spending for a variety of domestic programs while still lowering the 
budget deficit without an increase in taxes 
the flexible freeze would limit the growth in overall federal 
spending to the rate of inflation any programs allowed to grow at a 
faster pace would require offsetting cuts in other areas 
while bush mentioned several areas where he would increase 
spending he never specified where the cuts would be made 
boskin who was bushs principal economic adviser during the 
campaign was pressed during his confirmation hearing thursday 
before the senate banking committee to point out areas where bush 
would recommend cuts 
if there are no new taxes that means there will have to be 
some massive cuts in the federal budget said sen larry pressler 
rsd who repeatedly asked boskin to specify three or four 
areas where spending reductions should be made 
boskin emphasized that bush had not made any final decisions on 
the budget but he said he would personally favor reducing the rate 
of growth in the defense budget and in the governments health care 
costs 
if i was looking for large savings they would have to come 
from areas where there is large spending boskin said 
president reagans final 115 trillion budget for the fiscal 
year which begins next oct 1 did propose 5 billion in cuts in 
medicare and medicaid however it protected reagans defense 
buildup recommending that defense spending authority rise 2 percent 
above the rate of inflation 
boskins comments appeared to support the widely held expectation 
that bush will seek cuts in defense to pay for increased spending in 
domestic programs to fulfill his campaign promises 
boskin 43 received widespread praise during his confirmation 
hearings from senators who said bush had made an excellent choice in 
picking the highly regarded stanford university economist to lead 
the threemember council of economic advisers 
on other subjects boskin said 
social security benefits will not be touched in the bush 
budget boskin has been a longtime proponent of changes in social 
security and other middleclass benefit programs calling them 
welfare for the wealthy but in answering questions from 
senators boskin said president bush has made it clear that 
social security cuts are off the table and i dont advocate any 
cuts 
the bush budget will accept the basic economic growth 
projections on which the reagan budget was based critics have 
charged that the administrations growth interest rate and 
inflation forecasts are too optimistic and the economys actual 
performance will make it impossible to meet the deficit goals the 
budget budget projects a 1990 budget deficit of 925 billion below 
the 100 billion target established by the grammrudman deficit 
reduction law 
the president remains committed to his pledge not to increase 
taxes boskin said the proposal being considered to raise revenues 
to deal with the savings and loan crisis by imposing a fee on 
depositors at sampls and other financial institutions could be 
considered a user fee imposed on depositors for the protection they 
recieve from having the federal government insure their savings 
the council of economic advisers created in 1946 to advise the 
president fell on hard times during the reagan administration at 
one point the president considered abolishing the panel after his 
advisers grew disenchanted with former chairman martin feldsteins 
suggestions that tax increases should be considered because of the 
huge budget deficits 
boskin said he had been assured he would play a major role in 
helping to formulate policy in the new administration and intended 
to make suggestions to fill the other two spots on the panel as 
quickly as possible

president bush called government an 
opportunity for public service not private gain thursday as he 
urged senior federal executives to uphold high ethical standards 
our principles are clear that government service is a noble 
calling and a public trust bush told 3700 members of the senior 
executive service this administration is dedicated to ethics in 
government and the need for honorable men and women to serve in 
positions of trust 
bush chose his first speech outside the white house as president 
to reemphasize a theme he has been sounding all week 
the president speaking at constitution hall an auditorium owned 
by the daughters of the american revolution also pledged to make 
federal jobs more challenging more satisfying and more 
fulfilling 
although most of bushs cabinet was present as were many other 
toplevel political appointees the bulk of the audience was 
comprised of career civil servants 
bush said were all wise in the ways of washington especially 
you who have served this country with such distinction 
we know there are ups and downs he said but he added i 
must say there is a nice feeling around today in the country i 
think people when a new president comes in do root for him 
regardless of partisan politics 
bushs voice was noticeably raspy as he spoke press secretary 
marlin fitzwater said the president had a head cold 
as he has before bush offered straightforward advice for 
avoiding conflicts of interest simply to know right from wrong 
our duty is to serve and my strong conviction is that we must 
do it only for the right reasons government should be an 
opportunity for public service not private gain 
bush gave similar talks earlier this week in separate meetings 
with his cabinet and with his white house staff and on wednesday 
he appointed an eightmember commission to recommend by march 9 a 
new code of ethics for government officials

the commerce department on thursday ruled that 
japanese allterrain vehicles are being sold in the united states at 
less than fair value and proposed antidumping duties to erase the 
price advantage 
the duties would affect japanese exports of certain three and 
fourwheel vehicles designed for offtheroad use by one person the 
department said 
the money is to be held as a cash deposit or bond while the us 
international trade commission determines if the imports injure or 
threaten to injure us manufacturers the panel has 45 days to make 
a decision 
if the itc rules there is injury the commerce department would 
issue a final order instructing the customs service to collect the 
antidumping duties 
the proposed antidumping duties vary based on the gap between

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev probably will 
be ousted because he has failed to seek popular support in direct 
elections andrei d sakharov and his wife were quoted as saying in 
an interview published thursday 
the conservatives will overthow gorbachev or at least impose 
their views on him the conservative french daily le figaro quoted 
sakharov the dean of the soviet human rights movement as saying 
le figaro said the sixhour interview with sakharov and his wife 
yelena bonner also a prominent rights activist was conducted over 
three consecutive evenings at their moscow home 
the newspaper quoted bonner as saying the only real defense 
for a chief of state is direct election why is gorbachev afraid we 
would elect him our country has no other leader 
i think he will be overthrown soon she was quoted as saying 
i would not bet 10 rubles on gorbachev 
bonner said that if gorbachev is ousted so will be all those 
who believed in perestroika his program to restructure soviet 
society and its economy the paper reported 
sakharov who won the nobel peace prize in 1975 said the west 
must continue to pressure the soviet union on rights issues at 
least until an international human rights conference that is 
scheduled in moscow in 1991 
he said the meeting which initially was opposed by britain and 
the united states should only take place if the human rights 
situation in the soviet union is truly satisfactory 
le figaro quoted sakharov as saying that perestroika was 
absolutely necessary there is no other solution this doesnt 
mean that you have to support gorbachev without reservation to 
associate perestroika 100 percent with his name would not be fair 
gorbachev could come under pressure he could have other 
ideas sakharov was quoted as saying the restructuring has to 
be supported in general without worrying whether some people are 
going to be upset for the soviet individual today the question of 
collective rights is more immediate than individual rights 
he was quoted as saying he did not like the new electoral law 
which only allows officially sanctioned organizations to nominate 
candidates for the new peoples congress 
he said he also disliked another new law designed to allow 
authorities to break up meetings and demonstrations and to arrest 
armenian nationalist leaders le figaro reported 
sakharov described his visit last month to the adjacent southern 
soviet republics of armenia and azerbaijan which are embroiled in 
an ethnic dispute over nagornokarabakh a largely armenian enclave 
in azerbaijan 
it was terrifying he was quoted as saying a pregnant 
woman was raped burned alive stabbed and her fetus thrown on the 
sidewalk during the threeday siege of an armenian family then she 
was killed 
most armenians are christians and most azerbaijanis are moslems 
historical enmity between the two ethnic groups has broken out 
periodically 
sakharov also was quoted as saying the number of soviet jews 
denied exit visas has been considerably reduced but the 
legislation has not yet been changed

the nations soybean farmers are still being 
affected by crop prospects in brazil and argentina an agriculture 
department report said thursday 
combined production of the two countries is forecast at 31 
million metric tons up 33 million tons from last year the 
departments economic research service said 
however prospects are more uncertain this year because of 
delayed plantings in both countries and dry weather especially in 
argentina the report said the size of the south american crop 
will influence soybean prices and us plantings in 1989 
us soybean production last year the lowest since 1976 dropped 
to about 154 billion bushels or 419 million tons a metric ton is 
about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels of soybeans

manuel lujan president bushs choice for 
interior secretary told senators thursday he is committed to 
protecting and enhancing the nations natural resources but said 
that doesnt preclude some development 
we can do both we do not have to choose between them 
declared lujan whose senate confirmation is expected without major 
controversy 
lujan who spent 20 years representing new mexico as a 
congressman received a warm reception from both democrats and 
republicans on the senate energy and natural resources committee 
which is expected to send his name to senate floor for a vote 
probably next week 
one of two hispanics selected by bush for his cabinet lujan 
reminded the committee he is a westerner who grew up where 
reverence for the beauty and the sanctity of our land was instilled 
in me from the earliest days of my youth 
lujans childhood was spent on land that is now an indian 
reservation said the 60yearold former congressman as interior 
secretary he would oversee the bureau of indian affairs and in 
response to a question said he would become personally involved if 
he heard of any native americans being treated insensitively 
but lujans nomination has received only lukewarm endorsement 
from most environmental and conservation groups who complain that 
in 20 years in congress he voted against environmental interests on 
a number of occasions 
some of those votes have raised signals that you are not 
sympathetic to environmental legislation said sen mark hatfield 
rore citing specifically lujans vote against legislation 
sponsored by hatfield which expanded wilderness areas 
lujan defended his record on environmental and conservation 
matters and said he and bush are committed to protecting and 
enhancing the nations natural resources as well as proceeding with 
their environmentally sound development 
noting that some of these issues are highly controversial lujan 
said we all need to lower our voices so that we can hear each 
other 
development of our most promising domestic resources is called 
for because continued development is essential to the national 
security and economic well being of the united states he said 
at the same time we will oppose development in those 
environmentally sensitive areas where the risk of damage is great 
he continued 
environmental groups have raised concern about the possibility of 
oil and drilling on the vast arctic national wildlife refuge in 
northeastern alaska and have noted that lujan sponsored legislation 
in the last congress that would have allowed such drilling 
sen timothy wirth dcolo noted that the lines are already 
being drawn on the question of whether oil companies should be 
allowed onto the alaska refuge 
lujan said he was not happy that were starting off in a 
confrontational way as far as the wildlife drilling question is 
concerned suggesting that some of the difference might be worked 
out through discussions and compromise 
oil and gas development in the refuge would require congressional 
approval lujan said while he favored such development he is 
opposed to a land swap deal suggested by the reagan administration

a leftist coalition on thursday 
accused the government of hiding behind the constitution to prevent 
the marxistled guerrilla movement from taking part in the march 
presidential election 
this is the moment for the political parties to demonstrate 
whether they want peace or bones guillermo ungo presidential 
candidate of the leftist democratic convergence told a news 
conference 
the guerrillas who have been fighting the usbacked government 
for nine years offered tuesday to take part in elections if certain 
conditions were met the rebels previously have boycotted all five 
elections held this decade 
the insurgents proposal dropped their longstanding insistence on 
sharing power in a transitional government the major stumbling 
block in three rounds of unsuccessful peace talks between 1984 and 
1987 
the guerrillas main condition for participation was postponement 
of presidential elections from march 19 to september 
president jose napoleon duarte a christian democrat and the 
rightist opposition republican nationalist alliance or arena 
rejected the rebel proposal as unconstitutional 
the constitution says presidential elections must be held no 
later than two months before the end of the fiveyear presidential 
term duartes term ends june 1 
the constitutional problem invoked by some seems to us no more 
than a pretext to prolong the war and impede the advent of peace 
the democratic convergence said in a communique 
ungo and ruben zamora another democratic convergence leader 
presented a constitutional solution to the election date quandary 
the problem is not constitutional it is one of lack of 
political will said zamora 
convergence members said parties contesting the elections could 
force a postponement by withdrawing from the march balloting 
the absence of candidates would prevent the holding of 
elections said ungo he cited the constitutional provision for 
election by the legislature of an interim president who would serve 
until elections are held 
the constitution exists to serve the people as an instrument 
providing for peace and coexistence not to impede peace and 
coexistence said ungo 
zamora said the christian democrats and rightists are using the 
constitution as a skirt to hide behind 
arena candidate alfredo cristiani led christian democratic 
candidate fidel chavez mena in recent polls ungo is running a 
distant third according to the polls 
the guerrillas said they would throw their support behind the 
democratic convergence candidates if their conditions of 
participation were met 
the coalition in its press conference cited examples of 
repeated violation of the countrys charter under the current 
government 
for example the constitution requires security forces to obtain 
a search warrant before entering a citizens home but army troops 
and police regularly sweep through entire working class 
neighborhoods entering homes and going through drawers and personal 
belongings without warrants

yasser arafat will not request a us visa in 
order to address an arabamerican group and will visit the united 
states only if he gets an official invitation an aide said thursday 
the plo chairman arrived in spain from iraq on thursday to meet 
with the foreign ministers of spain france and greece in his 
campaign for international peace conference on the middle east 
those countries have been assigned by the 12member european 
economic community to gather support for a unsponsored 
conference the israeli government opposes such a forum and wants 
direct negotiations with arab countries but refuses to deal with 
the plo 
abdeen jabara president of the americanarab antidiscrimination 
committee said this month the group had invited arafat to speak at 
its april meeting and he had accepted 
in his comments in cairo on thursday nabil shaath did not 
explain why arafat changed his mind beyond saying the palestine 
liberation organization chief said he will not go on an invitation 
from an unofficial group 
shaath a top political adviser said arafat would accept only an 
official invitation from washington 
the united states refused arafats request for a visa to address 
the un general assembly in december saying he condoned terrorism 
and the assembly moved its session from new york to geneva 
after a geneva news conference in which arafat renounced 
terrorism and recognized israels right to exist the united states 
began talks with plo officials in tunisia 
israel considers the plo a terrorist organization and has 
bitterly criticized the decision by its principal ally 
a diplomat in madrid said privately thursday its no secret 
the united states is the only party that has any influence over 
israel what the eec is trying to do is send a message to 
washington 
another said it would not be surprising if arafat requested 
eec recognition of a palestinian state during his meeting friday 
with foreign ministers francisco fernandez ordonez of spain roland 
dumas of france and carolos papoulias of greece 
the palestine national council which acts as the plo 
legislature proclaimed an independent palestinian state nov 15 at 
a session in tunis the eec reacted favorably but did not extend 
official recognition 
spain holds the rotating presidency of the trading bloc for the 
first six months of 1989

the protective containment shells on nearly 
onequarter of the nations commercial nuclear reactors should be 
modified to reduce the risk of rupture during a major accident the 
nuclear regulatory commission staff said thursday 
but the staff making the recommendation to the commission said 
the containment vessels known as mark i and built by general 
electric co posed no immediate danger to public health or safety 
the commission took no action and said it would meet soon with an 
nrc advisory panel that earlier this week said the proposed 
modifications were unjustified 
the plant owners have generally opposed past suggestions of 
modifying the containment shells although the pilgrim nuclear 
reactor at plymouth mass over the last year has voluntarily 
performed all the actions now being urged by the nrc staff 
victor stello the nrcs executive director of operations told 
the commissioners that the modifications would cost no more than 
150 million for all 24 plants involved and that the financial 
burden was more than offset by safety gains 
he added however we do not believe there is any particular 
problem that requires precipitous action 
the mark i containments have been singled out for attention by 
the nrc because studies have shown them to be more vulnerable to 
failure during a reactor accident than other containment systems a 
containment failure could lead to the release of dangerous amounts 
of radioactivity into the atmosphere around the reactor 
the probability of a reactor core meltdown in a mark i 
containment in any given years is estimated at between onein10000 
and onein100000 not appreciably different than the risk for the 
industry as a whole said bill beckner the nrcs chief of severe 
accident issues 
as recently as 1986 nrc officials said the mark i containment 
system was likely to fail in nine out of 10 severe accidents such 
as a core meltdown commission experts said thursday however that 
the chances of failure were now believed to be much lower although 
they said there was wide disagreement on exact odds 
lando w zech the nrc chairman said we should take our 
time in deciding whether to require the changes to 24 of the 
nations 110 operating reactors he suggested that pressure to act 
quickly could lead to new safety problems 
we want to improve safety not detract from it he said 
antinuclear groups have called for quick action to improve 
safety at the mark i facilities 
the way it looks now i dont see them the nrc doing 
anything kenneth boley a nuclear safety analyst at the 
antinuclear group public citizen said in an interview after the 
commission meeting 
among the modifications recommended by the nrc staff is the 
installation of hard pipe vents that would relieve severe pressure 
resulting from damage to a reactor core 
stello said four or five of the 24 mark i facilities already have 
the improved their venting systems he did not say which plants were 
involved 
the commission staff also called for the provision of an 
alternate water supply with pumping capability independent of the 
normal and existing emergency power system it also said emergency 
procedures and training should be improved

there is no way to prevent another leak of 
chemicals stored at the abandoned artel chemical co plant said a 
federal environmental protection agency official investigating two 
leaks in the last week 
i believe we will be experiencing these things over and over 
until the warm weather is over said jerry saseen the epas 
coordinator of the artel chemical cleanup 
saseen and nitro mayor don karnes both blame unseasonably warm 
weather for a leak wednesday night and a leak jan 19 temperatures 
have been fluctuating from the 20s and 30s to the 50s and 60s during 
a january warm spell 
in each case moisture built up in a sealed 55gallon drum and 
the water reacted with the substance inside to create a cloud of 
chemical vapor 
no injuries were reported in either accident but both times 
nearby traffic was blocked and residents were asked to stay in their 
homes 
i guess this could happen two or three times a day karnes 
said i hope it doesnt there are a lot of chemicals over there 
the epa on thursday still was trying to determine exactly what 
was in the drum of waste acid that leaked wednesday 
there was a danger the substance could cause problems with 
thousands of other drums of chemicals at the epa superfund site 
saseen said 
the lid blew off and since it was acid we wanted to stop any 
corrosion of the other drums so we dusted it with soda ash 
karnes said 
cleanup crews could begin moving more than 5000 drums of toxic 
and hazardous chemicals from the abandoned plant as early as 
midfebruary said epa official doug fox the plant was closed and 
turned over to the epa in june after the federal government declared 
it a public health hazard 
epa crews were still sampling the drums to find out exactly what 
was stored at the site saseen said 
the leak last week involved thionyl chloride which reacted with 
water and released hydrochloric acid and sulfur dioxide which can 
be deadly in high amounts the epa said

random drug testing for key personnel 
including astronauts will start in march at the national 
aeronautics and space administration the chief of the agency 
announced thursday 
nasa administrator james c fletcher said a system of random drug 
testing will be applied to all employees in sensitive positions 
including senior level management astronauts flight controllers 
researchers and engineers 
additionally fletcher said in a nasa announcement drug 
testing may be required if there is a reasonable suspicion of 
illegal drug use or an accident or unsafe practice 
fletcher said because of the limited scope of drug abuse in the 
agency the nasa drug program will emphasize education training 
and assistance through the nasa employee assistance program for 
employees who may be experiencing a problem related to such drug 
use 
nasa recognizes that drug abuse is debilitating and that 
prolonged illegal drug use makes it progressively more difficult for 
the individual to refrain from such drug use fletcher said 
dwayne brown a nasa spokesman said the drug program is 
scheduled to start march 27 which is 60 days from the date of 
fletchers announcement 
fletcher said the new drug program is in support of an executive 
order from the reagan administration that calls for a drugfree 
federal workplace

soviet spies are flourishing as 
relations between the two superpowers improve said a former 
highranking soviet kgb officer who defected to the united states 
the nicer the relationship between the united states and the 
soviet union the more aggressive soviet intelligence is 
stanislav levchenko told the palm beach round table on wednesday 
soviets know americans very well said levchenko who 
defected to us authorities 10 years ago in tokyo where he spent 
four years as a major in the kgb the better the relationship the 
kinder more openhearted americans become americans are very 
trustworthy people 
the 47yearold former spy said one of the first things he 
learned upon joining the kgb was that his colleagues were nothing 
like those in the movies 
in films basically you understand within five minutes who the 
good guys are because they look good and bad guys look bad he 
said what i learned unfortunately was that bad guys looked like 
good guys and sometimes much better 
mice is the international acronym in the espionage world for the 
four means of recruiting agents and informants levchenko said the 
letters stand for money ideology compromise and ego 
its a very real thing that is going on he said the 
soviet intelligence against this country is dramatically growing and 
expanding

a senior vietnamese diplomat held discussions 
with bush administration officials thursday as part of what is 
believed to be the first visit ever by a hanoi representative to 
washington 
the occasion for the visit by trinh xuan lang vietnams 
ambassador to the united nations was a reception thursday night 
sponsored by a nonprofit group sightsavers international which 
seeks to train foreign doctors in eye surgery techniques 
state department spokesman charles redman said the administration 
waived rules limiting the envoys travels to the new york city area 
so he could attend the reception 
but the administration took advantage of langs presence to raise 
with him us concerns about american servicemen still missing from 
the vietnam war 
the thursday afternoon meeting included officials from the 
national security council the state department and the pentagon 
there also was a representative of the national league of families 
which is comprised of relatives of the missing servicemen 
redman noted there has been increased cooperation between the 
united states and vietnam in obtaining an accounting for the more 
than 1700 americans still missing in vietnam 
we want to make sure that the vietnamese continue to understand 
our concerns redman said 
a state department official asking not to be identified said 
that as far as he knew no hanoi representative has ever visited 
washington since the northern half of what is now vietnam became 
independent from france in 1954 
the two vietnams became united after the prous saigon 
government was defeated by the north in 1975 
vietnam is one of a handful of countries with which the united 
states does not have diplomatic relations when the state department 
official was told that langs visit to washington could be seen as a 
conciliatory gesture to hanoi by the new administration the 
official said that appearances are deceiving 
he reaffirmed an earlier assertion by redman that the bush 
administration is applying the same criteria as the previous 
administration for normalizing relations with vietnam 
according to that policy there will be no obstacle to 
normalization of relations once the vietnamese complete their troop 
withdrawal from cambodia 
at the same time the administration also attaches significance 
to continuing cooperation by hanoi in obtaining an accounting for 
the missing american servicemen

experts from six opec nations and seven independent 
oil producers agreed thursday to recommend further steps for 
bolstering world oil prices but stopped short of making specific 
plans for cooperation 
oil ministers from both sides will meet at a yetundecided date 
for further discussion on the issue opec general secretary subroto 
told reporters after the daylong closed meeting 
the nonopec countries also stated in a communique that they 
supported opecs goal of achieving a target price of 18 a barrel 
as soon as possible 
they agreed on the need to take further steps to enhance 
improvements already achieved and to further strengthen the oil 
market especially in the second quarter of 1989 the communique 
read 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries has been trying 
to enlist the support of nonopec producers since the cartel agreed 
at its november ministerial meeting to curtail its own production in 
order to boost prices 
since the opec agreement prices have moved higher and the chief 
us crude west texas intermediate sporadically has topped 18 a 
barrel in recent futures trading 
the spot price of north sea brent blend the most widely traded 
international crude oil fell to 1625 a barrel thursday night 
down 43 cents from late wednesday 
on the new york mercantile exchange the march contract for west 
texas intermediate plunged 40 cents to settle at 1772 a barrel 
the lowest level of thursdays session the contract had jumped 58 
cents on wednesday 
the communique did not specify possible steps for supporting 
prices although subroto said a 5 percent production cut is an 
option 
nonopec sources had speculated some of the independent producers 
might offer to cut their collective production by 5 percent without 
requesting reciprocal cuts from opec 
the two sides said they also agreed this initial effort should 
be continued in the second half of the year and consolidated 
thereafter to establish a more permanent longterm cooperation for 
achieving durable oil market stability 
analysts said the futures markets may have been disappointed by 
the lack of concrete plans 
they didnt recommend any specific action said nauman 
barakat vice president of energy investments at prudentialbache 
securities inc in new york their statement was so vague that it 
didnt really mean anything 
the attending opec nations were kuwait algeria saudi arabia 
indonesia venezuela and nigeria the other opec members are 
ecuador gabon libya qatar iran and the united arab emirates 
the communique from the independents said the nonopec group 
consisted of representatives of angola china colombia egypt 
malaysia mexico and oman and observers from the soviet union 
norway the yemen arab republic the canadian province of alberta 
and the us states of alaska and texas 
opec members agreed in november to limit their production to 185 
million barrels a day effective jan 1 
opec members are producing an estimated 195 million barrels a 
day down as much as 35 million barrels a day from the fourth 
quarter that has helped oil prices recover from around 12 a barrel 
in december

a synagogue dropped plans to be host for a 
rally against former ku klux klansman david dukes state house 
campaign the congregations rabbi said thursday 
very strong feelings against the meeting from the members of 
the congregation and the community in general has forced 
reconsideration said rabbi gavriel newman of congregation beth 
israel it is our judgment that any efforts to clarify to the 
community to how dangerous david duke is to louisiana would forge 
support for him from those who agree with his viewpoints 
mordechai levy head of the new yorkbased jewish defense 
organization earlier thursday had announced plans for the feb 14 
rally levy said the rally would be a peaceful and legal mass 
meeting to derail and hopefully ruin the duke campaign 
newman said levys earlier statements that his group would not 
rule out violence in its efforts against duke were a factor in the 
decision to cancel the rally 
we still feel that it is essential that people understand that 
david duke having a history of racism and bigotry is an extremely 
dangerous man 
duke 38 former imperial wizard of the knights of the ku klux 
klan led a field of seven candidates in the jan 21 primary 
election for the house seat in the mostly white suburban new orleans 
area he faces john treen 62 in a feb 18 runoff 
levy said after learning of newmans decision that he was trying 
to find another synagogue for the rally 
levy said earlier this week that the jdo would take any means 
necessary including violence to disrupt dukes campaign

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan urged 
congress thursday not to reduce tax deductions for interest paid on 
bonds and loans used to finance corporate takeovers 
greenspan told the senate finance committee that restricting 
deductions for interest paid on highyield bonds and other debt to 
finance leveraged buyouts takeover defenses and corporate 
restructuring would create adverse secondary consequences 
in response to questions however greenspan said it is not 
possible to figure out in advance what the consequences of 
taxlaw changes would be and acknowledged if it were done over a 
long period of time i suspect the market implications would not be 
large 
greenspans comments conflicted with comments by bush and reagan 
administration officials who have put part of the blame for the 
october 1987 stock market crash on an aborted attempt then by the 
ways and means committee to modestly restrict interest deductions on 
debts incurred in corporate restructurings 
securities and exchange commission chairman david ruder warned 
the finance committee on wednesday that tampering with the tax code 
could create another panic in a skittish and nervous stock 
market 
both the finance and ways and means committees are reexamining 
leveraged buyouts in the wake of the pending 25 billion purchase of 
rjr nabisco co by kohlberg kravis roberts amp co and the 13 billion 
buyout of kraft inc by phillip morris co last year 
those were the biggest two of more than 300 leveraged buyouts 
totaling nearly 100 billion in 1988 
two weeks before he took office president bush in discussing 
buyouts left open the possibility of changing the way the tax laws 
treat dividends and deductions for interest payments on junk bonds 
a leveraged buyout is similar to a person buying an automobile on 
credit with a very small down payment in the case of the auto 
purchase a three to fiveyear loan is secured by the value of the 
car being bought 
with a leveraged buyout or restructuring of a corporation 
highinterest junk bonds secured by the companys assets are issued 
to buy stock from shareholders at premiums 45 percent or more above 
its market price beforehand 
to cover the interest payments the new owners often have to cut 
back on research sell off some assets or divisions close stores or 
plants lay off workers or cut their pay and and reduce pension 
contributions 
congress in 1986 voted to gradually end the tax deductions for 
interest paid on car loans and other consumer credit purchases but 
left in place deductions for home mortgages and virtually all 
corporate debt 
aflcio president lane kirkland told the committee that congress 
should make similar discriminations with regard to the 
deductibility of interest on the various types of corporate debt 
kirkland estimated that mergers takeovers and leveraged buyouts 
this decade have directly cost 90000 union workers their jobs and 
forced thousands of others to suffer cuts in their wages and 
benefits 
while the rest of the industrialized world soberly invests in 
the future our financial elite with the complicity of major 
banks brokerage firms investment house and prestigious law firms 
is engaged in drunken shortterm speculative revels kirkland said 
the government should not be subsidizng these questionable 
deals by providing tax subsidies but this is precisely what the tax 
code does he said

one man brandished a torch and demanded to be flown 
abroad and another threatened to blow up a passenger plane in two 
unsuccessful attempts to hijack soviet planes news reports said 
thursday 
the latest in a series of attempted skyjackings occurred saturday 
at the airport in the ukrainian city of ivanofrankovsk the 
government daily izvestia reported 
as an antonov24 began taxiing onto the runway for a flight to 
kiev a passenger ignited a homemade torch and demanded a flight 
abroad the paper said 
the aircraft stopped and a stewardess passengers and a pilot 
subdued the wouldbe hijacker according to izvestia a fire that 
had started in the cabin was quickly extinguished and two 
passengers and the pilot were slightly burned izvestia said a 
34yearold man s zemskov was arrested 
the hijacking attempt came one day after a similiar incident 
aboard a tupolev134 flying from the russian city of archangel to 
the ukrainian cities of kiev and odessa 
as the plane began its descent friday over the black sea to 
odessa a man threatened to blow up the aircraft unless it was 
diverted to either bucharest romania or israel the newspaper 
reported 
the pilot promised to meet the demand after refueling in odessa 
izvestia said a policeman boarded the plane in odessa and traded 
himself for the rest of the passengers 
two hours later 36yearold n kotsyuban a mental hospital 
patient was arrested the newspaper reported 
the report did not describe how the man was arrested or say how 
many passengers were aboard either aircraft it also did not explain 
the delay in reporting the hijacking attempts 
hijackings have been rare in the soviet union but recently there 
have been several 
last month four air pirates commandeered a school bus boarded 
an ilyushin 76t transport plane and flew to israel they were 
arrested in israel and returned to the soviet union

an elite panel of scientists whose advice to 
the department of defense is often cloaked in secrecy has received 
a briefing from researchers who believe a linear accelerator may be 
a cheaper safer and quicker way to produce tritium than building 
new reactors 
the defense department has consulted the panel known as the 
jason group on military projects involving complex technologies 
since 1959 
the briefing late last week in la jolla calif was made by 
researchers from the los alamos and brookhaven national laboratories 
and the westinghousehanford co who for more than a year have been 
exploring the possibility of using an accelerator to produce tritium 
a key ingredient in nuclear weapons 
they seemed to be very enthusiastic and highly supportive of 
the idea said william kato chairman of the department of nuclear 
energy at brookhaven 
kato said that the normal practice of the group would be to write 
a report that i assume would go to the department of defense and 
department of energy 
others who attended the briefing but asked not to be identified 
said the presentation marked the first time the accelerator concept 
had been presented to an independent technical review team 
kato said the presentation was similar to one made to department 
of energy officials in washington last august 
the energy department which builds nuclear weapons for the 
military is proceeding with plans to construct two new tritium 
producing reactors 
a top official of the energy department told a senate committee 
on wednesday that the department felt technology was not mature 
enough to use a linear accelerator rather than a nuclear reactor to 
produce tritium 
an accelerator is essentially a long tunnel in which subatomic 
particles are whipped at high speeds until they crash into a target 
in this case lithium clad in aluminum the resulting collision 
produces tritium a radioactive gas used in nuclear weapons 
the nations existing tritium producing reactors located at the 
savannah river complex in south carolina have been beset with 
safety problems and are currently shut down 
chris sankey a department spokeswoman said thursday that as a 
longrange option to augment not replace our plans for two new 
production reactors we may undertake additional evaluation of the 
accelerator concept that would take place when a concrete proposal 
is presented to the department 
the jason group is composed of about 55 scientists who do 
sophisticated scientific research and analysis in support of the 
national security community said jan bodanyi a spokeswoman for 
the defense department 
ms bodanyi said most members are physicists and include nobel 
laureates and other highly respected scientists 
he group has studied such other problems as designing the 
strategic defense initiative and detecting plastic guns said ms 
bodanyi

the defense department on thursday lifted its 
contracting suspension of the sundstrand corp after the company 
agreed to repay 623 million to the pentagon and to make other 
costsaving concessions on future contracts 
the payments and concessions which involve accounting 
procedures would be in addition to the 115 million the company 
agreed to pay the government last october in settling a federal 
fraud investigation 
the 115 million agreement already had been described as the 
largest single fraud settlement in history 
the defense logistics agency has lifted the suspension of 
sundstrand corp from bidding on government contracts following a 
settlement of administrative issues the pentagon said 
sundstrand corp has agreed to repay the government 623 
million in cash and make accounting changes that will result in 
additional savings in the future 
larry wilson a spokesman for the defense logistics agency said 
the new agreement called for sundstrand to make an immediate cash 
payment of 40 million a separate payment of 99 million on or 
before sept 1 and payments totaling 124 million to be made 
in equal annual installments of 248 million over the next five 
years 
wilson said the accounting changes would provide the pentagon in 
effect with some price guarantees on future contracts because it 
would force the company to modify the way it allocates charges 
between its commercial and military work 
those savings could eventually total another 34 million wilson 
said 
the pentagon suspended sundstrand from doing any new business 
with the federal government on oct 19 saying it wasnt satisfied 
with the companys response to being caught up in a fraud 
investigation overseen by the us attorney in chicago 
while the suspension did not affect existing contracts it 
prevented the corporation and six subsidiaries sundstrand data 
control inc falk corp sundstrand heat transfer inc sundstrand 
service corp sullair corp and signatron inc from bidding on 
or receiving any new contracts 
the rockford illbased company a manufacturer of electronic 
mechanical and hydraulic systems for aircraft on oct 12 agreed to 
pay 115 million to the government and to plead guilty to four 
counts of defrauding the defense department by overbilling on 
aircraft parts 
at the same time its sundstrand data control subsidiary settled 
a separate case by agreeing to pay 13 million that case involved 
charges the company had used unallowable costs to inflate its 
overhead rates 
the us attorney in chicago anton valukas said a federal 
investigation had determined that besides overbilling for aircraft 
parts the company had been submitting claims for such things as 
babysitting expenses country clubs and servants for its executives 
the company also was attempting to improve its ability to 
market hardware to the defense department by giving gratuities to 
defense department personnel and their spouses while concealing 
their identity the government said 
the defense department accounts for 42 percent of sundstrands 
14 billion in annual sales 
wilson said thursday the pentagon was now willing to lift the 
suspension because the company has implemented a comprehensive 
employee ethics program taken meaningful disciplinary action 
against the employees involved and made full restitution

the new secretary of state james a baker iii 
spent his first day at work thursday settling into his 7th floor 
suite and deciding to close the us embassy in kabul afghanistan 
baker one of president bushs closest friends and the man who 
managed the final months of bushs campaign for the white house 
kept a low profile during his first working day and issued no 
schedule 
within hours of being sworn in wednesday night however the 
rising turmoil in the afghan capital required his attention 
a us official who asked not to be identified said baker had 
decided that the us contingent reduced to less than 10 officers 
and security guards in recent weeks would be pulled out over the 
next several days 
the move came as the soviets continued to pull out troops that 
have been in the country since 1979 and as fighting increased 
between the promoscow government and usbacked rebels battling 
for control of the country 
the official added that the decision had been put off by reagan 
administration officials and left for baker to deal with after he 
was sworn in which took place shortly after the senate confirmed 
his nomination 
asked about bakers day department spokesman charles redman 
would say only that his new boss was getting established thats 
his first priority and that baker had met with his top people 
asked by a reporter to identify those individuals so that clues 
might be drawn about who might in line for the top slots in the 
department during the new administrations overhaul of personnel 
redman smiled and declined to reveal bakers appointments evoking a 
round of laughter from journalists 
redman also said he had no information about any foreign contacts 
that baker planned to have and said the new secretary looked toward 
monday as being his day to get into operation 
true to the former treasury secretarys crisp and formal style 
baker held earlymorning meetings with top aides in his formal 
office workspace attired in suit and tie said one senior official 
who met with him 
bakers predecessor george shultz had been known to strike an 
informal note meeting with aides in his more cozy sitting room 
doffing his suit coat for a sweater and poking intermittedly at the 
embers in his fireplace 
baker was sworn in in a private ceremony at the streetfloor 
transition office hed been using since his nomination a more 
formal oathtaking ceremony was set friday afternoon in the elegant 
east room of the white house

a civil court has ruled that roberto calvi the 
central figure in a banking scandal that reached into the vatican 
was murdered in 1982 and did not commit suicide news reports said 
thursday 
calvis body was found hanging from a london bridge days after he 
disappeared from italy where he was under investigation for his 
inability to account for 14 billion in loans and interest on the 
books of the bank he headed banco ambrosiano 
a coroners jury in london in june 1983 left open the question of 
whether calvi hanged himself or whether he was murdered to stop him 
from revealing details about the financial scandal 
calvi was called gods banker for his close relations with 
the vatican 
the milan civil court suit was filed by calvis widow clara who 
wanted to collect on the bankers 3 million life insurance policy 
issued by assicurazioni generali italys largest insurance company 
i am very satisfied by the sentence of the milan civil court 
which has recognized the death of my husband as an assassination and 
not a suicide mrs calvi was quoted as saying by the italian news 
agency ansa 
a spokesman for assicurazioni generali armando zimolo confirmed 
that the policy prohibited payment in the case of suicide he said 
the company had held off paying until the cause of death was 
established 
wednesdays verdict did not mean the calvi family would collect 
on the policy the calvi case has yet to go before a criminal court 
and the milan tribunals decision could be overturned on appeal to a 
higher civil court 
the turinbased newspaper la stampa said the milan court ruled on 
the basis of the autopsy and a reconstruction of what the court 
believed happened on the night of june 17 1982 at blackfriers 
bridge in london 
calvi was found dangling from scaffolding under the bridge with 
11 pounds of bricks stuffed into his pockets and another brick 
jammed down the front of his pants 
banco ambrosiano collapsed following its failure to collect 14 
billion in loans made to 10 dummy companies in latin america 
controlled by the vatican bank

afghanistan has invited secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar to visit kabul and explore ways of avoiding 
a bloodbath after all soviet soldiers have left the country un 
sources said thursday 
under a unmediated agreement the red army is to be gone by 
feb 15 leaving afghanistans conscript army to continue the 
11yearold war with moslem guerrillas 
the official sources said privately that president najib extended 
the invitation recently and it was under consideration 
no details were available but the sources said perez de cuellar 
might witness the final soviet withdrawal feb 15 
soviet soldiers entered afghanistan in december 1979 and the 
last of an estimated 115000 are to be out by feb 15 
about 70 un monitors are observing the withdrawal which began 
may 15 of last year no plans have been made for a peacekeeping 
force to prevent violence afterward 
official spokesman francois giuliani said diego cordovez the 
secretarygenerals special representative for afghanistan was 
expected to visit kabul before the deadline 
cordovez has been urging afghan factions to reach a political 
settlement the guerrillas have rejected proposals by the soviets 
and najibs government 
increased attacks by the insurgents who are supported by the 
united states and pakistan have made it difficult for supply 
convoys to reach kabul creating a severe food and fuel shortage 
a soviet airlift has carried hundreds of tons of flour and fuel 
to the capital since lass saturday 
many observers have predicted a bloodbath after the soviet 
departure the guerrillas who control the countryside claim 
najibs regime will fall quickly 
the united states said thursday its kabul embassy would be closed 
over the next several days the american staff already had been 
reduced to fewer than 10 officers and security guards 
un aid officials in kabul have said more food and fuel is 
needed if disaster is to be averted 
prince sadruddin aga khan un coordinator for relief and 
rehabilitation met in geneva on wednesday with representatives of 
the world health organization un development program and unicef 
the un childrens fund 
all came to the conclusion that the united nations must be 
present in the whole of the country including kabul particularly 
to help women and children giuliani told reporters at his daily 
briefing 
negotiations with guerrillas also have been reported in an 
attempt to arrange for movement of relief convoys

a scottish immigrant who became a 
decorated vietnam soldier and then a troubled veteran with a string 
of arrests told a deportation judge thursday that he cant explain 
the crazy stuff hes done 
hearings ended thursday on whether fred s jackson 40 a 
resident alien in this country for more than 20 years should be 
deported immigration judge billino w dambrosio said he would rule 
on the case within 60 days 
jackson facing deportation because of 26 felony convictions 
since he got out of the army in 1970 is arguing that he should be 
allowed to stay in the united states because of his military record 
resident aliens who have been convicted of at least two crimes 
involving moral turpitude are subject to deportation 
he blames his crimes on the posttraumatic stress syndrome a 
condition found in some vietnam veterans and victims of violent 
crimes 
jackson says flashbacks of terrifying ambushes and firefights led 
him to abuse drugs and alcohol 
during the hearing thursday sean keenan a us immigration and 
naturalization service attorney questioned jackson about his 
criminal record especially the six convictions since deportation 
proceedings began in 1978 jackson conceded that those offenses 
might strengthen the case against him 
i cant explain any of the crazy stuff ive done said 
jackson who was seriously wounded twice in vietnam and awarded two 
purple hearts and the bronze star 
if i knew what i was doing i wouldnt have done it he said 
immigration officials have continually refused to discuss the 
case in detail or their reasoning for seeking deportation saying 
laws prevent them from doing so 
jackson was treated at the posttraumatic stress unit at the 
veterans administration medical center in northampton mass last 
summer he said he hasnt used drugs or alcohol in more than six 
months 
the immigration service began deportation proceedings against 
jackson in 1978 after a string of convictions for burglary larceny 
and drug possession 
in 1980 jackson was convicted of armed robbery charges in 
florida the government renewed efforts to deport jackson after his 
release from prison in 1985 
jacksons legal representative robert d money of the 
international institute said his recent problems including an 
arrest for drunken driving in april 1988 dont necessarily ruin his 
chances to remain in the united states 
it isnt a serious blow because in freds case he has an 
illness money said hes going allout to cooperate with the 
doctors 
jackson who retains a slight scottish brogue enlisted in 1967 
at age 18 two years after his family emigrated to norwich an 
industrial city about 30 miles southwest of hartford he went to 
vietnam in january 1968 as an infantryman with the 1st air cavalry 
division 
he now lives in public housing in norwich with his wife 
charlene her 6yearold son and their infant daughter the family 
lives on disability payments from the army and from social 
security which has declared him 100 percent disabled

the army displayed its volunteers 
thursday solemn teenagers and men in their late 30s in answer 
to charges of dragging young men from their homes to fight 
guerrillas as soviet soldiers withdraw 
they are all volunteers weve had 266 coming here in the past 
three days said col abdul ghani who commands one of nine 
training centers on the capitals outskirts 
there may be some places where there are people who had to 
join but here they all came because they want to defend the 
country he told western reporters visiting the center 
afghanistans conscript army desperately needs recruits now that 
the kremlin is giving up on a military commitment that lasted almost 
a decade 
two years of army service is compulsory but thousands of afghans 
have deserted during 11 years of war with moslem guerrillas many 
more young men have fled the country either to avoid conscription or 
to join the insurgents 
western diplomats estimate most afghan battalions are onethird 
under strength and say they have reports of young men being taken 
away by force 
one said scores were taken last week during housetohouse 
searches in kabuls shash darak district flown to kandahar in the 
south and given uniforms the city is ringed by guerrillas who 
control the afghan countryside 
diplomats report similar raids in the other parts of the city 
guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in april 1978 
soviet soldiers arrived in december 1979 and reached an estimated 
strength of 115000 by the time a unmediated withdrawan agreement 
was signed last april 
they began pulling out may 15 half had left by aug 15 and the 
rest are to be gone by feb 15 leaving the afghan army with a 
lastditch battle to save the sovietsponsored government 
the insurgents were not parties to the withdrawal agreement and 
have rejected soviet and afghan government proposals for a political 
solution 
western diplomats in pakistan reported thursday that soviet 
troops and afghan government forces killed hundreds of people and 
wiped out villages during an attack monday on the salang highway 
about 60 miles north of kabul 
also thursday secretary of state james a baker ordered the 
closing of the us embassy in kabul a us official in washington 
said 
many afghans acknowledge privately that their sons support the 
guerrillas or have left the country to avoid military service 
stringpulling appears to be more difficult as the final soviet 
departure nears an afghan secretary at a un agency a diplomats 
daughter said the military had taken her 17yearold brother 
and her father was not allowed to take his family along to a foreign 
post 
the government of president najib says it has 500000 men under 
arms or in paramilitary units according to western estimates 
however the army totals 3500040000 men the khad secret police 
35000 and the tsarandoy force of the interior ministry 35000

shawali a 39yearold former teacher with his hair cut short sat 
beside a semiliterate 18yearold mohammad akhram in a class on 
basic arms instruction 
speaking through a government interpeter before the colonel and 
the rest of the class shawali said had been exempt from military 
service as a teacher but decided to join up becaue we must 
defend our country perhaps at my age it will encourage others to 
join 
akhram said until i no longer have blood i will fight for the 
protection of my country 
ghani said the 1000 recruits at his center will get three to six 
months of training before going out to fight guerrillas 
he acknowledged the volunteers would not be permitted to change 
their minds and said well why should they after coming here 
recruits armed with kalashnikov assault rifles and wearing bulky 
overcoats went through their places at a firing range flinging 
themselves down in the mud and snow

american and north korean diplomats have held two 
meetings in beijing apparently the first in at least a year 
according to reports thursday in china and in washington 
sin in ha the north korean ambassador told a news conference in 
the chinese capital the talks were not anything to shout about 
it was very simple he said living together on the same 
planet it is impossible not to have contact we always keep the 
door open for talks but the united states closes the door 
neither he nor the us state department would reveal details 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman gave the 
meeting dates as dec 6 and last tuesday 
we believe that these contacts have been useful he said 
both sides stated their positions on korean peninsula political 
and security issues 
redman said the meetings between the political counselors of the 
two embassies were arranged through the good offices of china 
an ally of communist north korea 
he said north korea delivered a letter from foreign minister kim 
yonnam to george p shultz then secretary of state at the 
december meeting and the united states responded at this weeks 
session 
the meetings were believed to be the first since washington 
relaxed rules last fall on contacts between the two countries which 
do not have diplomatic relations 
in january 1988 the state department declared north korea a 
terrorist nation and barred substantive discussions with north 
korean envoys in third countries the action responded to the 
bombing of a south korean jetliner in november 1987 by a woman who 
said she was a north korean agent 
when the 1988 seoul olympics concluded in october without 
disruption by north korea the united states again authorized such 
contacts

the communist party on thursday announced the 
rehabilitation of 10 leaders of a jewish group that spread soviet 
propaganda abroad during world war ii but was later broken up in 
josef v stalins reign of terror 
a commission of the partys ruling politburo which has been 
announcing rehabilitations of the soviet dictators victims since 
last year made the announcement about the jewish antifascist 
committee the official tass news agency said 
the panel said the supreme court threw out the sentences of the 
committees leaders in 1955 three years after they were imprisoned 
or executed but it said the exoneration of the leaders was not 
publicized at the time 
stalins successor as soviet leader nikita s khrushchev began 
rehabilitating victims in the 1950s but the process was cut short 
with his ouster in 1964 president mikhail s gorbachev resumed the 
process in his campaign for reforms 
during the war the jewish antifascist committee worked to rally 
soviet and world public opinion against fascist atrocities 
after the war its leader the famed soviet jewish actor solomon 
mikhoels traveled to the united states to raise money for the 
devastated jewish community in the soviet union stalin considered 
these acts treason and espionage 
in 1948 the committee was dissolved and its leaders arrested on 
espionage and other charges that tass said thursday were 
groundless 
mikhoels was killed in 1948 in what soviet authorities described 
at the time as a traffic accident but it is believed to have been 
an officially sponsored assassination 
four years later he was accused of being a key figure in the 
doctors plot an alleged scheme in which kremlin doctors mostly 
jews were accused of trying to kill soviet leaders after stalins 
death the doctors and mikhoels were rehabilitated 
the politburo commission said solomon lozovsky a former 
assistant foreign minister of jewish origin was among eight 
committee leaders legally and politically cleared in an unpublicized 
action in 1955 
two other committee members ba shimeliovich and dn 
gofshtein have just been restored to the communist party tass said

authorities on thursday identified two 
more west german companies that may have helped build an alleged 
chemical weapons plant in libya 
hubertus voegele a spokesman for the offenburg prosecutors 
office said the companies are the pentsao shipping company of 
hamburg and an imhausenchemie subsidiary the gfa company in bochum 
the two were among the companies whose records were seized in a 
widening probe of west german involvement in the construction of the 
plant investigators said they began evaluating the documents last 
week 
the process will take a long time said voegele 
customs authorities on wednesday searched the offices of the two 
companies a third company and the homes of 12 individuals on

prince norodom sihanouk once cambodias ruler and 
now a rebel leader said thursday he will not attend peace talks 
next month because the vietnamesesponsored government of his 
homeland rejected his proposals 
sihanouk who heads a coalition fighting vietnams decadelong 
occupation of cambodia said in a statement that it is absolutely 
useless for me to be in jakarta capital of indonesia for the 
negotiations 
he also said he would not go to paris in the spring for a meeting 
of the three rebel factions and the cambodian government and had 
called off a meeting in bangkok with siddhi savetsila foreign 
minister of thailand scheduled for the end of february 
representatives of vietnam laos the warring parties of cambodia 
and the noncommunist association of southeast asian nations are to 
meet feb 1922 in jakarta for a second session of peace talks the 
first was held last july 
members of asean are thailand indonesia singapore malaysia 
the philippines and brunei 
sihanouk arrived in beijing on tuesday and had said the next day 
he would go to jakarta but not participate in the meetings 
his fivepoint plan proposes that international peacekeeping 
force supervise vietnams withdrawal from cambodia which it invaded 
in december 1978 and has occupied since 
hun sen premier of the government vietnam installed in phnom 
penh claims the plan would facilitate the return to power in 
cambodia of the khmer rouge the strongest of the three resistance 
groups 
the khmer rouge led cambodia from the end of the indochina war in 
1975 until the vietnamese invasion and was responsible for at least 
1 million deaths 
chinas army attacked vietnam in 1979 to punish it for 
invading cambodia invasion but last week the two countries held 
their first highlevel meeting in a decade 
vietnam agreed in principle to withdraw from cambodia by 
september if a political settlement is reached it also agreed to 
supervision by an international group whose makeup has not been 
determined 
china said it would slow aid to the rebel coalition in tandem 
with the vietnamese departure 
the agreement in principle does not represent a change in 
position by either country 
sihanouk said tuesday he opposed linking an end to material aid 
to the resistance and the withdrawal of vietnamese troops and was 
pessimistic about easy solutions 
progress had been made on solving the international aspects of 
the conflict he said but a deadlock remained on the 
composition of a future cambodian government 
in bangkok prime minister chatichai choonhavan urged all 
factions to attend the jakarta negotiations 
the cambodian parties must face one another he told 
reporters after two days of talks with hun sen its pointless for 
them to fight and kill one another

secretary of state james a baker iii on his 
first day on the job decided thursday to close the us embassy in 
kabul amid rising turmoil during a soviet troop withdrawal a us 
official said 
the us diplomatic contingent in kabul had already been reduced 
to less than 10 officers and security guards their situation is 
considered precarious in light of a bitter civil war between the 
promoscow government and usarmed rebels 
the us official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
pullout would be carried out over several days 
all 50000 soviet troops in the wartorn country are supposed to 
leave by feb 15 under the geneva accords signed last april 
their departure is expected to remove a stabilizing influence on 
the kabul government the guerrillas meanwhile are likely to 
redouble their offensive against government forces no longer backed 
by the red army 
apart from the small diplomatic contingent there are fewer than 
20 private us citizens in afghanistan they have been encouraged 
to leave and the state department has urged americans not to travel 
to the country 
on wednesday the mayor of kabul said the capital had a 
threemonth supply of food and fuel in case of a guerrilla siege 
soviet soldiers handed out emergency rations soviet cargo planes 
began flying loads of flour and fuel to kabul on saturday 
the reagan administration in its final days pondered whether to 
abandon the embassy or to leave the decision to its successors the 
us official said it was left up to baker and he decided to close 
the embassy on his first day of the job 
earlier charles e redman the state department spokesman said 
there were reports from kabul that soviet and afghan forces had 
obliterated with artillery attacks all of the dwellings in a number 
of villages south of the salang tunnel through which soviet troops 
are departing the country 
there are eyewitnesses who say no dwellings remain and hundreds 
of civilians were killed redman said 
he said no us embassy personnel were in the devastated area 
bakers order came almost 10 years after a us ambassador to 
afghanistan adolph dubs was shot and killed after he was kidnapped 
by moslem extremists 
dubs was seized feb 14 1979 as he was being driven to the 
embassy his kidnappers demanded the release of moslem religious 
figures and dubs was killed in an exchange of gunfire which occurred 
when afghan government security stormed the hotel where he was being 
held 
other than those in embassies most westerners are with the 
international aid mission a charitable organization that has 
operated in afghanistan for many years among other things it runs 
an eye hospital in kabul 
britains embassy in kabul issued warnings last week to to its 
nationals and citizens of other countries for which it has 
diplomatic responsibility including canada australia and ireland 
other than the missionaries foreigners still in afghanistan 
include a few hundred diplomats a dwindling number of soviet 
civilian advisers employees of the international red cross and 
officials of un aid agencies and the un body monitoring the 
withdrawal agreement 
on saturday the west german embassy became the first to close 
spokesmen for others say they confer regularly about when or whether 
to do the same

a surgical supply company president who was 
the target of a bombing attempt by an animalrights activist 
acknowledged thursday that his company has used paid informants to 
infiltrate animalrights groups 
if we didnt have somebody in the animal rights group that 
believed in right and wrong you and i would not be having this 
conversation id be dead said leon c hirsch president and 
founder of us surgical corp 
fran trutt was arrested nov 11 in norwalk after police said she 
placed a radiocontrolled pipe bomb packed with roofing nails on the 
grounds of us surgical they said she apparently opposed the 
companys use of live anesthetized dogs in surgical equipment 
demonstrations 
meanwhile cbs news obtained a taperecorded conversation of a 
woman it identified as trutt telling an informant that she knew 
what had to be done and planned to go for leon an apparent 
reference to hirsch 
hirsch in a telephone interview thursday with the associated 
press asserted that terrorists within the animalrights 
movement have left us surgical and other medical companies little 
choice but to wage a sort of counteroffensive to protect themselves 
many of them are very dangerous organizations he said 
they dont believe in right and wrong as most people in society 
do they believe that human beings are on the same par as rats and 
dogs and they are prepared to take violent actions to enforce their 
beliefs 
hirsch dismissed suggestions that trutt 33 of new york city had 
been entrapped saying that neither his company the norwalk police 
nor his security consultant perceptions international inc of 
stratford had aided or coerced trutt into planting the bomb 
there was absolutely not a shimmer of entrapment involved 
here he said that woman attempted to kill me it was her idea 
it was her orchestration 
the westport news reported earlier this month that us surgical 
through perceptions international had recruited marc mead of 
westport to strike up a friendship with trutt and to inform us 
surgical of her activities 
the authorities have said mead 30 helped transport the bomb to 
us surgicals parking lot and was with trutt when she was arrested 
that same day mead has not been charged in the case 
meads attorney kenneth damato said he wouldnt discuss the 
case 
trutt is being held under 500000 bond and is scheduled to 
appear in stamford superior court for a pretrial hearing feb 2 
on the taperecording obtained by cbs the woman the network 
identified as trutt said then im going to do what has to be done 
im going to go for leon im going to learn to make a bomb if i 
have to make it myself 
in an oncamera interview with cbs trutt reiterated previous 
statements that she only meant to frighten hirsch 
trutt said an informant gave her the money for the bomb but said 
she wasnt coerced into planting it

defense secretarydesignate john tower told a 
senate confirmation hearing thursday that the more than 1 million 
he made as a consultant for major defense contractors would not 
influence his decisions at the pentagon 
tower on the second day of hearings before the armed services 
committee said congress should tighten revolvingdoor laws to 
prevent officials from profiting unfairly unethically or 
illegally or inordinately if they move between pentagon and 
industry jobs 
but he cautioned congress that it should write such laws 
carefully enough so that honest hardworking people who might want 
to engage in public service are not summarily proscribed from 
working at the pentagon 
in addition to personal and ethics questions tower was asked 
about specific weapons programs such as star wars the mx and 
midgetman missiles the 600ship navy and special operations forces 
tower voiced skepticism about the prospects for the strategic 
defense initiative as star wars is formally known former president 
reagan launched the program five years ago and said it should be 
aimed at building a ballistic missile defense bmd that would 
protect americans from soviet nuclear attack 
to begin with i dont believe that we can devise a bmd 
umbrella that can protect the entire american population from 
nuclear incineration i think thats unrealistic tower said in 
answer to questions from sen al gore dtenn 
tower cautioned that i dont want to get out in front of 
president bushs sdi statements bush said during last falls 
campaign that he favored deployment of a limited sdi system as soon 
as possible 
tower explained that sdi was part of an effort to move nuclear 
strategy from an offensive to a defensive focus but he cautioned 
it remains to be seen whether that is a realistic objective 
gore noted towers pessimism about sdi prospects represents a 
view markedly different from the publics perception of president 
reagans advocacy of a perfect defensive umbrella 
nothing is sacred as the bush administration struggles to cut 
the federal budget deficit tower said but he declined to say what 
recommendations he would make and said decisions on specific issues 
must await a strategic review ordered by the president 
asked when decisions would be made he said its got to be 
soon 
president bush has said he would send congress a revised version 
of the pentagon budget that president reagan submitted reagan 
proposed a 2 percent growth in defense spending after inflation 
bush aides and senior members of congress have said holding the 
increase to the inflation rate expected by the administration a 
bit under 4 percent was more realistic 
during the afternoon session devoted to defense policy tower 
acknowledged the soviet unions military superiority saying at 
this moment they have the capability to prevail in an invasion of 
western europe 
tower was also pressed on the defense budget as sen carl levin 
dmich asked if the need for a strong defense would require an 
increase in taxes 
i read the presidents lips tower said referring to bushs 
campaign claim i disagree with them at my peril 
the session thursday opened with a lengthy review of towers 
dealings with defense contractors after 1985 when he ended a 
24year senate career that included a stint from 198184 as chairman 
of the armed services committee 
according to towers earlier testimony he received 763777 in 
fees from the defense contractors over a threeyear period he later 
adjusted that total to 1028777 to include the 265000 paid by 
british aerospace 
tower testified that he terminated all financial ties and 
contracts with defense companies on dec 1 last year one day after 
learning from bushs transition staff that he was under serious 
consideration for the defense post he said he did not stand to 
gain from the prosperity of any former associate 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee 
said he was concerned about towers former ties with those defense 
contractors 
frankly the difficulty here is not that you have worked for a 
contractor as a consultant but a number of them five or six or 
seven of the major corporations nunn said if you were to 
recuse not involve yourself on all of them you couldnt be 
secretary of defense 
tower said the likelihood is i will bend over backwards to 
avoid favoring his former associates 
your former clients might worry nunn said 
that may be true tower responded 
nunn told tower that i know you and i know you are an honest 
person 
tower told committee members he had never engaged in the types of 
activities described in the ill wind investigations of 
consultants who are accused of selling contractors inside 
information on pentagon procurement deals 
under persistent questioning from levin tower said he would 
recuse himself from making decisions on the cfin system the combat 
flight inspection system which allows airborne aircraft to check on 
whether landing transmitters are working correctly because of the 
extensive lobbying he did for the program on behalf of the ltv corp 
but he refused to specify other systems he would recuse himself 
from saying he would handle those on an ad hoc basis 
sen john warner rva asked tower whether tougher ethics laws 
were needed for people who transfer between jobs at the pentagon and 
industry 
tower said that in light of what has happened in the 
procurement cases legislation was needed to reduce the likelihood 
if not foreclose anyone who had been in the defense department from 
profiting unfairly unethically or illegally or inordinately in 
an industry job 
still tower noted that donald j atwood whom he has chosen as 
deputy defense secretary has been vice chairman of the general 
motors corp a major pentagon contractor he said other top aides 
would be drawn from the defense industry as well

a 73yearold man apparently stuck in a 
trash can on his front porch since monday waved to visitors who 
let it pass and eventually died of a heart attack authorities 
said thursday 
robert hamm was wedged up to his armpits his lower legs sticking 
out of the standard galvanized trash can when he was found 
wednesday by the mother of a newspaper carrier who first saw the 
old man sitting in the can monday 
it was a natural death something that could have happened any 
time said a monroe county medical examiners spokesman who said 
it was policy not to identify himself it could have happened 
while he was sleeping in bed 
hamm who lived alone waved to the newspaper carrier and to a 
mail carrier while in the can earlier this week but may have been 
too weak to alert them that he was stuck police said they refused 
to identify the carriers 
i would imagine he was probably trying to signal something but 
his expression or whatever wasnt enough to get them to do anything 
about it said sgt rj liepins they all feel very bad 
liepins said it appeared that hamm described as being of medium 
height and build had fallen backward into the can on his enclosed 
front porch and couldnt get out 
police said thursday they did not suspect foul play in the death 
and had no way of verifying whether he actually was stuck on the 
porch three days hamms house was apparently intact and its 
contents undisturbed officers said 
the 11yearold newspaper carrier told police she waved at hamm 
and said hello from outside the porch while delivering the newspaper 
about 4 pm monday she said he waved back and mumbled something 
police said 
on tuesday the mail carrier whose name was unavailable also 
saw him in the can from outside the porch and saw his hand move 
liepins said he thought something was funny but he just let 
it pass liepins said 
the newspaper carrier told her mother on monday and again on 
tuesday but the woman didnt go to hamms house until wednesday 
because she didnt think anything was seriously wrong 
he was kind of eccentric and we didnt think anything about 
it police quoted her as saying

thursday night and put the international communications satellite 
intelsat vf15 into orbit 
the rocket left the european space agency launch pad on the

announced that the satellite was in orbit and declared the mission a 
success in the coming days the orbit will be adjusted to station

telephone calls and nearly all transoceanic television transmissions 
the launch is the first of the year for arianespace a consortium 
of 50 european companies responsible for the commercial exploitation 
of the ariane series of rockets developed by the european space 
agency 
in seven launches last year all successful arianespace put 13

six activists arrested during a wave of 
unrest in prague have been released but they and other dissidents 
still could face charges sources and a government offical said 
thursday 
palach press an emigre publishing house in london told the 
associated press by phone that six activists were released wednesday 
evening but could face charges of disturbing public order and 
hooliganism 
those charges carry a maximum sentence of one year and two years 
in jail respectively 
three other activists remain jailed including banned playwright 
vaclav havel czechoslovakias most prominent dissident government 
spokesman miroslav pavel said thursday 
asked at a news conference what charges havel will face pavel 
replied apparently also hooliganism 
the 52yearold playwright who was sentenced to four and a half 
years in jail in 1979 at a subversion trial that provoked outrage in 
the west has been in custody since jan 16 
havel and 15 other activists were arrested after eight of them 
tried to lay flowers on pragues wenceslas square in memory of 
student jan palach who set himself on fire 
palachs act on jan 16 1969 was to protest the presence of 
soviet troops in his country stationed there since the 1968 
sovietled invasion that crushed the communist party reforms 
pavel told a news conference thursday that 519 people were 
arrested during the prague unrest that began on jan 16 and lasted a 
week he said 130 were charged with misdemeanors and 79 with 
hooliganism 
pavel confirmed that two activists jana petrova and otakar 
veverka remained with havel in custody thursday and face charges 
of hooliganism 
in another development pentecostalists in the czech republic 
have been granted the right to legally practice their religion as of 
feb 1 the communist party daily rude pravo said thursday 
frantisek jelinek a vice minister in charge of religious affairs 
for the republic was quoted as saying that the approval of the 
apostolic church based on the pentecostalist movement is a way to 
express equality of all denominations and religous tolerance in 
czechoslovakia 
in the czech socialist republic this will be a relatively 
small church with approximately 2ooo believers jelinek said 
religious activism in this predominantly roman catholic country 
has been growing in recent years 
western analysts said the legalization of the small apostolic 
church in the czech lands several years after it was formally 
recognized in the countrys other republic slovakia was intended 
to mollify criticism abroad about an alleged lack of religious 
rights in czechoslovakia 
the new apostolic church which draws most of its supporters from 
among younger people will raise the number of officiallyrecognized 
churches and religious societies in czechoslovakia to 19 rude pravo

president jose napoleon duarte 
on wednesday accused leftist guerrillas of threatening to disrupt 
next months elections and rejected their proposal that the 
balloting be postponed 
this is not a proposal for peace it is a proposal for war 
duarte told journalists during a visit to the supreme court 
the proposal announced tuesday by guerrilla leaders in mexico 
city was virtually rejected that afternoon by fidel chavez mena 
the presidential candidate of duartes christian democratic party 
the marxistled insurgents have been battling the usbacked 
government for nine years they offered to participate in the 
presidential election if it were postponed from march 19 to 
september and other conditions were met 
the rebels have rejected as farce all five elections held 
this decade claiming they formed part of what the insurgents call a 
usimposed counterinsurgency project 
the proposal is plagued with unconstitutionalities duarte 
said of the guerrilla offer 
the constitution says presidential elections must be held no 
later than two months before the end of the the 5year presidential 
term duartes term ends june 1 making march 31 the latest 
constitutional election date 
the guerrillas said in their document they would accept the 
extension of duartes administration until the new election date 
duarte who is dying of liver cancer said i dont accept the 
idea of remaining in the presidency even one minute after the end of 
my term 
the rightist republican nationalist alliance or arena also 
rejected the guerrilla proposal as unconstitutional arena candidate 
alfredo cristiani is leading chavez mena in recent polls 
duarte said the positive element of the guerrilla proposal was 
that for the first time they recognize there is a solution apart 
from the solution of violence 
still duarte said the proposal was one of war 
he cited the paragraph of the guerrilla document that reads 
the conditions of the current electoral scheme makes it 
illegitimate for that reason the fmln has rejected the elections 
and as long as they are not modified the fmln will maintain its 
position of accompanying the people in rejecting the current 
elections this electoral process aggravates the war our proposal 
contributes to peace 
duarte said there are the threats theyre talking about 
attacks escalating the war 
guerrilla sources have indicated that if the proposal were

a man who ate two cans of sardines in a 
store and tried to steal money to pay for them deserves his 
conviction the state supreme court ruled wednesday but his crime 
does not merit life in prison 
the high court upheld the burglary conviction of clyde ashley jr 
and ordered a new sentencing hearing 
in essence the state high court said the trial judge erred in 
levying the life sentence without parole even though ashley had many 
previous convictions according to the court records ashley 44 
was paroled on dec 13 1985 after spending 23 years of his life in 
prison for a series of burglaries and an attempted robbery each 
committed while under the influence of alcohol 
once more while drinking ashley rather pathetically and 
pitifully again ran afoul of the law said justice james 
robertson writing for the court 
the court said on jan 15 1986 ashley after being rebuffed in 
attempts to get money from 85yearold eva washington entered a 
small grocery store in osyka in pike county and was seen opening and 
eating two cans of sardines 
the owner of the store cornered ashley and demanded payment 
ashley told him he would go to his aunts house to get some money 
the owner went with ashley who took him to washingtons house 
the store owner waited called police when ashley did not return 
and ashley was found hiding in a closet in washingtons home 
on march 18 1986 ashley was convicted of burglary in a 
separate sentencing hearing the trial judge ruled ashley was a 
habitual offender and sentenced him to life without parole 
robertson wrote that the seemingly undue harshness of the 
sentence for ashleys great sardine caper is evidenced by 
comments from prosecutors that they would not oppose a lighter 
sentence 
robertson said while the trial judge could have reduced the 
sentence he did not our law is susceptible of mechincal 
operation nor are our courts robots the justice wrote

dennis wears an electronic band around his 
ankle a constant reminder of his criminal record for the privilege 
of wearing it and being at home instead of in prison he surrenders 
half his paycheck 
when he leaves the house and feels a fresh breeze and watches it 
rustle the leaves on trees dennis figures hes got a pretty good 
deal 
its better than being in prison i pay and i leave for home 
and then i can see the trees and its worth it its just part of me 
now 
if trends continue there will be twice as many offenders in the 
united states being monitored with electronic tethers this year as 
the 2300 a day in a february 1988 national institute of justice 
survey said david dillingham of the national institute of 
corrections part of the justice department 
a december survey of manufacturers revealed that since the first 
test of the tethers in 1983 in albuquerque nm some 11000 have 
been shipped said marc renzema a kutztown pa university 
criminal justice professor who publishes the newsletter offender 
monitoring 
michigan has 1100 people in its program more than any other 
state said richard brummer a vice president of bi inc of 
boulder colo the largest of 11 producers of house arrest devices 
florida with 650 is no 2 
the tethers smaller than a cigarette pack and less than 5 
ounces have replaced michigans extended furlough program in 
which convicts were released and told they had to stay home when not 
at work or school that hasnt changed what has changed is that 
those rules now can be enforced 
there wasnt the staff and manpower to call somebody repeatedly 
seven days a week now we know to the minute when somebodys coming 
and going said laura young supervisor for one of the states 
three monitoring centers 
if someones curfew is 8 pm were taking steps by 810 pm 
if theyre not home yet before it just wasnt done a person could 
be gone for seven days now for inmates at four hours if we cant 
locate them they go in the law enforcement information network 
computer system as an escapee 
the typical participant was convicted of a property crime 
behaved well in prison and has 15 to 18 months before eligibility 
for parole sex offenders violent criminals major drug dealers and 
career criminals are barred 
the tether is attached to an ankle by a plastic strap the 
watertight unit is coded to a device attached to a phone in the 
inmates home if the signal is interrupted when the prisoner is 
supposed to be home or if either device is tampered with the 
transmitter sends a message to the monitoring center 
about 3 percent of the tethered inmates in michigan have escaped 
and fewer than 2 percent have become repeat felons 
it will never be as secure as a jail cell we dont nail the 
front door shut said brummer whose company services 60 
jurisdictions in 30 states 
in florida the anklets or less restrictive wristlets and 
pagers are used as a punishment somewhere between prison and 
probation said corrections department spokesman bob macmaster 
in michigan about 49 million has been budgeted for the program 
this year but the corrections department expects to collect 18 
million in fees from prisoners the daily cost of phones and 
equipment averages 6 per inmate working participants must turn 
over half their salaries not to exceed the cost to the state the 
average daily reimbursement per inmate in 1988 was 320 
the state estimates thats about half the cost of a day in jail 
or prison 
in addition to easing prison crowding the tether program gives 
convicts a chance at a head start on an education or training 
program as well as allowing them to earn money and live with family 
dennis who asked that his last name not be published served 
time for breaking and entering he lives with his parents while 
studying electronics and working as a security guard and must wear 
the tether until he is eligible for parole in may 1990 
it doesnt discourage me time is not standing still its 
going forward he said this kind of keeps me in line it helps 
me remember this is my friend

the 8yearold girl offers up a piece of paper 
and a pen and pleads could you just write one more 
you just want to be a big cheese in school dont ya says 
ringo starr cigarette dangling from his mouth as he cheerfully 
signs another autograph 
the girl nicole leach is no pintsize autograph hound but one 
of starrs costars on shining time station a new pbs 
childrens series that premieres saturday 
starr the rest of the cast and the producers had just completed 
a crosscountry promotional tour for shining time station which 
has gotten more than the usual dollop of publicity due even the most 
charming of childrens programs which shining time station is 
thanks to the presence of the former beatle in the cast 
we all know its the truth its a lot of easier if im on the 
tour too because people want to come and ask what youve been 
doin for the last 100 years but somewhere in there they mention 
the show said starr chatting in a suite overlooking central park 
starr is already a childrens star in england where he is heard 
but not seen as the narrator on the popular totappeal thomas the 
tank engine and friends a storybook segment included in shining 
time station 
im savaged by 5yearolds he says laughing 
in the american show starr plays mr conductor a tiny 
specialeffects figure who lives in the walls of the train station 
popping up occasionally to entertain the children and help teach the 
simple lessons aimed at the programs target audience 4 to 
7yearolds 
ive always enjoyed children starr said his own three 
children are grown and he has a 3yearold granddaughter tatia 
the songs in the old days i sort of went to the kiddie crowd 
so it was sort of a natural thing you know he said but to be 
magic and little it was fabulous 
britt allcroft cocreator and producer of the show with rick 
siggelkow said she talked starr into narrating thomas the tank 
engine and friends in england after hearing him on the television 
in another room 
i heard this voice being interviewed and i thought thats the 
voice of thomas storyteller she said 
she calls the show storybook television television 
programming that has sort of qualities more akin to those youd find 
in childrens literature 
starr said he cant wait to be as big a kiddie star in this 
country as he is in england after all his career has not exactly 
been booming 
the first half of the last 100 years i was really busy doing 
albums and records and films and everything and then it all started 
sort of slowing down and slowing down and lately i havent been 
doin much at all 
so im just pleased of this opportunity he says with mock 
pitifulness 
he said part of the reason for the career slide was his recently 
admitted alcohol problem he and wife barbara bach checked into an 
unidentified substanceabuse clinic in the united states last year 
yeah i had an alcohol problem starr 48 said i still 
have the problem of course but i dont drink anymore ive had the 
problem for a long time its been three months to yesterday that i 
havent had a drink 90 days i had to get help and i got help 
and im feeling better it was just getting on top of me 
a deal to star in an american television sitcom never 
materialized last season but starr hasnt been totally idle he 
sang when you wish upon a star for stay awake an album 
compiled of walt disney tunes sung by various rock stars and he has 
his own compilation coming out feb 28 on rhino records called 
starr struck 
im pulling myself together im sort of starting the year off 
now and well do what were going to do theres really nothing 
laying around oh ive got this in the pipeline and im reading 
these scripts theres nothing like that at all were startin the 
year clean so be interesting if you come and see me in december 
and youll see what happened oh didnt do a thing eh

it may seem odd to say that god speaks through 
the work of such entertainers as rock musician bruce springsteen 
filmmaker woody allen and the singeractress madonna 
but that it happens is the studied conclusion of a exploratory 
and versatile roman catholic priest the rev andrew greeley of 
chicago 
he maintains that they and a procession of other purveyors of 
pop art including romance novels westerns mysteries and comic 
strips are frequent channels of divine grace 
god may indeed be encountered in works of the lively arts which 
ordinary people enjoy greeley says but highculture critics 
and church officials generally look down on such output 
just because its enjoyable and thus immensely popular he says 
doesnt mean its not good and it also neednt be overtly religious 
to convey notes of the sacred 
after all he adds many of the parables of jesus were utterly 
secular without specified religious content yet were loaded with 
sanctifying import and meaning 
grace is everywhere greeley says and is especially to be 
sought in popular culture because of its demonstrated huge appeal 
and influence 
greeley scholarly sociologist and also bestselling novelist 
with 110 books to his credit in both fields advances his thesis in 
a new book god in popular culture published by thomas moore 
press of chicago 
i suppose the elitists will ridicule the idea of finding god in 
science fiction mystery stories pop singers and comic strips he 
said in a telephone interview from his spring semester teaching post 
at the university of arizona 
thats their problem not mine but god lurks everywhere 
what im doing is nothing more than the song in the book of 
job god speaks through the stars in the sky and also through the 
storytellers and singers today he reveals himself through them 
greeley 60 details a case for this in a variety of pop 
output and performers western film actor clint eastwood singer 
linda ronstadt horror novelist stephen king tvs domesticlife 
comic bill cosby and others 
describing cosby as an evangelist greeley says he is the 
most influential religion teacher in america through the 
paradigms of love on his tv series about a black family 
a modern version of the medieval morality play has slipped into 
primetime television almost without anyone noticing greeley 
writes 
he calls actorfilmmaker allen a godhaunted person his work 
always preoccupied with the god question even if dubious about 
his existence 
it is humor that has provided the opening for him to become the 
most explicitly theological filmmaker in america today greeley 
says 
of the singeractress madonna with her flamboyant attire and 
streetwise candor greeley says she demands for young women the 
right to be what their bodies demand of them simultaneously virgin 
and siren 
citing her song like a virgin about a lover who treated her 
like a virgin shiny and new instead of like a usedup discarded 
thing greeley describes it as the timeless cry of the human heart 
for renewal 
he says the songs most gentle and tender of human lovers is a 
hint of what god is like 
greeley says much of springsteens rock music is deeply 
religious and asks serious questions about what life means 
he is a major religious prophet his tunnel of love album may 
be more important than a papal visit 
he sings of religious realities sin temptation forgiveness 
life death hope in images that appeal to the whole person not 
just the head and which will be absorbed by far more americans than 
listened to the pope greeley writes 
troubadours always have been more important than theologians or 
bishops 
about the laconic film hero eastwood greeley examines 
particularly his film pale rider terming its leading character 
who appears in response to a prayer a protochrist figure 
eastwoods films reveal ever more starkly our hunger for a 
saving paladin greeley says 
he says bigselling romances spurned or lampooned by critics 
deal explicitly with the question of whether human aspirations can 
possibly be fulfilled can we overcome can we love 
the romances answer is that we can if we work at it and up to 
a point he says it is a modest enough answer and however 
flat the plot and characters it is more reassuring and hopeful 
than the negativism usually demanded by academics and critics 
of comic strips greeley says some are terrible but some 
offer some of the best wit social commentary and moral philosophy 
to be found anywhere in contemporary america 
there are few better sources of irony in the world than the 
comic pages he says and irony is finally an essential 
ingredient of any valid theology for irony sees the folly of human 
pretensions 
it is the counterweight to all idolatries

frustration and lamentation long have been 
associated with the low personal savings rate in america and the 
latest to join the crowd is alan greenspan chairman of the federal 
reserve board 
speaking before the house banking committee the erudite analyst 
of all things economic confessed that in at least one area he was 
baffled he too he said had little idea of how to get people to 
save more 
but there are plenty of savings ideas floating around and some 
of them might work but just as importantly there are many ideas 
about the savings rate that say it isnt nearly as low as a lot of 
folks think it is 
statistically speaking the us rate is low during the period 
from 1947 to 1981 it averaged 48 percent of gross national product 
from 1982 to 1987 it averaged 37 percent but the trend may have 
reversed 
more recent figures indicate that in the first half of 1988 the 
rate averaged 41 percent up from 32 percent in 1987 in that time 
it reached a low of 18 percent in august 1987 and a high of 43 
percent in june 1988 
how do these numbers compare with other nations terribly 
japans personal savings rate for example is sometimes higher than 
20 percent several other nations are near or close to double 
digits the united states is near bottom 
but hold on do these statistics really say that americans are 
unable or unwilling to save maybe not 
among the more effective critics of the lowsavings theory is 
edward yardeni an individualist among a fraternity of like 
thinkers let us not forget the baby boomers says yardeni 
prudentialbache director of economics 
yardeni maintains that much of the lowered savings rate is a 
result of the bulge of young people working its way through the 
economy he observes that the baby boomers born after world war ii 
have been in the expensive period of life financing housing 
furniture babies education cars and the like 
baby boomers he points out now are becoming couch potatoes 
they are retiring from the spending mode and entering a slacker 
more reflective time of life figuratively they are sitting on the 
couch watching television 
as a result yardeni bravely forecasts a sharp rise in the 
savings rate from 4 percent or so to 10 percent over the next five 
years 
paul craig roberts the assistant secretary of the treasury for 
economic policy under president reagan who now is chairman of the 
institute for policy economy not only cites yardenis thesis but 
adds other evidence 
a methodological quirk for example is involved in the low 
savings rate says roberts in computing gnp rental values are 
imputed to housing and counted as consumption whether the housing is 
owned or rented by occupant 
any time therefore that there is a demographic bulge of 
householdforming young adults the consumption of housing will 
rise relative to disposable income but in a practical sense 
buying a house helps more people put more money away for future use 
than any other tool conceived by mankind 
but are there ways to raise the savings rate as measured 
traditionally of course through incentives an important 
incentive the individual retirement account already exists 
although badly watered down 
a possible incentive could be engineered through a change in the 
tax laws that would reduce the amount of taxes on interest earned 
all interest on savings is now subject to taxes there is a 
disincentive to save 
various proposals have been made to allow freedom from taxes for 
the first few thousand dollars in savings accounts other proposals 
would include an expansion of iras on which taxes are deferred 
until retirement age to include money saved for meeting education 
expenses or the down payment on a house 
why not isnt education an investment for the national good 
isnt a fullyowned house one of the best retirement insurance 
programs in existence 
while he expressed concern over his inability to conceive ways to 
raise savings rates greenspan already is doing something about it 
in seeking to keep inflation restrained he is restoring faith in 
the importance of saving 
that faith was shattered in the 1970s and many people will never 
forget it while savers lent their money to banks for as little as 
525 percent interest in passbook accounts raging inflation cut the 
buying power of those savings to a fraction 
those who borrowed prospered because they repaid in cheaper 
dollars those who saved financed the new wealth of borrowers while 
going broke themselves it takes time to forget

robert urich is sipping juice in a coffee shop on 
central park south across the street the carriage horses blanketed 
against the cold shift from one foot to the other and wait for a 
fare 
urich is talking horses hundreds of horses stampeding horses 
and the heat and dust of filming lonesome dove in south texas 
last year 
the fourpart cbs miniseries based on larry mcmurtrys epic 
western novel airs feb 58 
urich bestknown as a tv private eye in vegas and spenser 
for hire had gone to a riding stable to brush up on his 
horsemanship before the the filming 
its one thing riding in a ring with an instructor telling me 
to do this and do that he said than to be out on some 
godforsaken prairieland where everything that grows has thorns and 
to have robert duvall turn to you and say ok boys lets jump 
some gullies 
there were scenes where we were supposed to be driving 150 head 
of wild horses tommy lee jones whos a terrific horseman 
he was telling me bobby whatever you do dont get 
perpendicular to these horses because one punches you sideways all 
the rest of em are gonna run over you i was scared to death 
duvall and jones play augustus mccrae and woodrow call 
respectively theyre two aging former texas rangers who aim to 
push a huge herd of cattle to montana and start a ranch urich plays 
against type as womanizing card sharp jake spoon their 
irresponsible friend 
you hear actors talk about finally lining up with a character 
and a place and time where everything just seems not only a creative 
experience but a personal experience and thats what this was for 
me urich said i felt like i grew as a human being i really 
connected up with this thing 
ironically he turned the role down twice not having read the 
book that inspires adoration from its readers and not knowing other 
actors were climbing all over each other trying to get a part in the 
miniseries 
simon wincer man from snowy river directed bill witliff 
raggedy man country is executive producer and wrote the 
screenplay 
urich said that despite his exhaustion after three years of abcs 
spenser which was not picked up for the 198889 season he 
decided he had to do lonesome dove on the same screen with 
duvall jones and the rest of the cast which includes anjelica 
huston and diane lane he figured he would finally be measured as a 
serious actor 
urich will do more to change his image next fall when he stars in 
a new series for nbc tentatively titled american dreamer 
produced by gary david goldberg creator of family ties urich 
will play what he describes as a charles kuralttype character whose 
travels and recollections make for something of an our town for 
television 
we want to try to do timely things gary said thats the nice 
thing about doing this kind of show something thats on your mind 
on monday can be on the air on friday that really appealed to me 
and not doing another drugrelated embezzlement show urich said 
meanwhile he and his wife and two young children are moving back 
to los angeles from boston where they lived for the three years 
spenser was filmed there he said he always felt something like 
a fish out of water 
as friendly as new englanders are im this guy from 
hollywood who ought to be driving around in a fancy car and not 
taking out my own garbage and raking leaves out front or working 
with a chainsaw he said 
i had three extension ladders disappear i couldnt figure 
it out the last one ive got now i bothered to put my name on it 
it has to be they have to assume why would a guy from hollywood 
have a ladder and if he did he wouldnt know what to do with it 
anyway 
but i liked getting in the car and driving to the ski club 
which is 10 minutes away and i liked being close to maine but i 
dont belong there which is the final thought shouldnt really be 
there and coming back to la which i couldnt wait to get out of 
im starting to come to terms with some smog and some traffic 
because i just felt more relaxed

among the less obvious victims of the wholesale 
shenanigans in the securities and commodities marketplaces is the 
treasured and fragile concept of selfregulation 
millions of americans are asking themselves these days if it 
works it being the belief that buyers sellers and their 
agents and the general public too are served best if those who run 
the markets also police them 
hoping to retain freedom from outside interference all major 
securities and commodity exchanges study trading patterns and other 
activities for violations of standards such as pricerigging 
collusion and misinformation 
offenders are fined suspended from exchanges banned from 
trading and if required reported to law officers for possible 
prosecution most of those caught are relatively little fish their 
illfortune hardly roils the waters 
in recent months however some of the biggest fish since the 
1930s have been turning up in the nets not of the selfregulators 
but of the federal bureau of investigation and the violations seem 
more pervasive than isolated 
the governments investigation of futures trading and the 
possible routine cheating of customers at the chicago board of trade 
and chicago mercantile exchange suggests how ineffective 
selfpolicing might have become 
so wellknown were certain questionable futures trading 
practices and so often were they criticized publicly within and 
outside the exchanges that the fbi found reasons to act where the 
selfpolicers had been if not idle then ineffective 
the actions of the mercantile exchange following the issuance of 
subpoenas illustrates how unaggressive and impotent selfpolicing 
appears to have become 
after acknowledging that the exchange itself had studied 
activities in the socalled yen pit where trades involving the 
japanese yen were conducted leo melamed chairman of the exchanges 
executive committee stated 
i dont think we could have done any better the practices and 
the way we conduct business gives the opportunity for a violation 
no one watching just standing there could have done anything 
the feds did do something they infiltrated trading pits 
recorded deals being made observed what they believed to have been 
fraud gathered names established a grand jury to hear evidence and 
arranged for subpoenas 
the mercantile exchange then acted appointing a 10member panel 
to review trading procedures a move similar to that made following 
accusations that futures trading practices helped worsen the stock 
market crash of 1987 
there would be no sacred cows in its own investigation said 
melamed weve got to change the rules so even the few cant do 
anything dishonest with a public order he declared 
what matters he said is that we use this opportunity to act 
responsibly and make improvements where they are necessary 
the exchangeappointed panel that studied the impact of futures 
trading in the stock market crash of october 1987 tended to 
exonerate the exchange suggesting instead that it was a bulwark 
against even further damage 
there seems little likelihood that the current panel cannot 
suggest changes in trading practices that would allow better 
surveillance improve recording of transactions and eliminate the 
confusing fish marketlike pit procedures 
but whatever corrections emerge from what appears to be another 
public trading debacle others involve misuse of inside stock 
information trading conspiracies collusion and the like public 
confidence has been shaken 
the entire concept of selfregulation has been put on trial as 
it was in the 1930s when it was demonstrated that the policemen not 
only had reneged on their responsibilities but had used their 
authority to mask their misdeeds 
those earlier shenanigans resulted in more government regulation 
it took years for the industry to recapture a degree of selfcontrol 
and public trust which it requires if its practitioners are to make 
the good living it affords 
now the fear exists that they might have tossed it away again 
and with it the entire notion that free markets operate most 
efficiently when governmental interference is held to a minimum

when the army corps of engineers general told 
jack brooks that the federal government would never build the 
proposed sam rayburn dam a sneer crossed the face of the crusty 
texas congressman 
general said brooks as a hush fell over the committee room 
long after youre gone im still going to be here and so is that 
dam 
he is and it is 
today rayburn dam stands astride the angelina river 10 miles 
north of jasper in east texas 
and brooks a tough prickly texas democrat stands astride the 
house judiciary committee new chairman of the panel whose authority 
ranges over narcotics gun control civil rights and a host of other 
explosive issues 
brooks a gritty 66yearold exmarine is renowned for the 
defiant jut of his cigar and putting house committee witnesses on 
the griddle 
federal bureaucrats who sought to outfox brooks until now 
chairman of the house government operations have emerged from the 
committee room pale and wobbly on their feet after getting a dose of 
his treatment 
in recent years he pilloried the air force for excessive 
computer purchases costing an estimated 800 million and savaged the 
state department for a costly attempt to replace the silverware in 
us embassies around the globe 
with a flash of earthy humor brooks locked horns with the reagan 
administration over a plan to expand liedetector tests for federal 
employees 
if the polygraph were worth a cottonpicking thing he 
snorted every wife in this place would buy one 
brooks was born dec 18 1922 in crowley la his father died 
when he was 12 and he was forced to go to work 
he worked his way through the university of texas was a reporter 
on his hometown beaumont enterprise served in world war ii and 
earned a law degree while sitting in the texas legislature he won a 
house seat in 1952 
since then he has come to dominate the district and a decade 
ago the federal building there was named for him 
from the start though brooks carved out a political style that 
at times verged on the downright ornery 
in one early campaign his opponent called brooks a communist 
his response was pure brooks 
he threatened to get a gun and shoot his opponent or anyone else 
who repeated the charge some oldtimers claim he underscored the 
point at one stop by taking out a gun and placing it on the dais 
so proud of his fierce image is brooks that once when the 
washington post published a picture of him wearing an unusually mean 
expression he went from one fellow lawmaker to another jubilantly 
showing it off 
almost everyone agrees that a key influence was the late speaker 
sam rayburn dtexas the most powerful man in congress when brooks 
arrived 
mr sam liked to mete out excruciating political punishments 
to those who crossed him and brooks learned from the old master 
saving his choicest acidtinged remarks for committee witnesses 
caught diverting from the truth 
he has a real penchant for zeroing in on something like that 
says administrative assistant sharon matts he just sort of smells 
it 
understandably europeans grumbled several years ago when brooks 
became president of the north atlantic assembly a group of 
parliamentarians from nato nations their style and his were never 
quite in sync 
indeed brooks once led a junket on which the americans were 
dined royally at a palatial country estate owned by an english 
nobleman afterward brooks toasted the host and his eye resting 
momentarily on an oil portrait over the hearth added thanks to 
your daddy the duke who made all this possible 
today brooks is a far cry from the awestruck poor boy who came 
here three decades ago a dallas timesherald story in 1978 told how 
brooks engaged in sophisticated real estate and bank investments 
that led to some hefty insurance commissions 
it was all perfectly legal but the stories showed that behind 
the justfolks manner lay a complex mind capable of deft financial 
footwork for a time brooks grew testy about it and toward the 
author paul west 
one oldtime texas journalist tells how he sat down next to 
brooks at a texas delegation meeting and was asked by the 
congressman if he happened to know west the answer was yes 
brooks fell silent a moment blew an immense cloud of cigar smoke 
into the air and said finally id like to take that boy

its beginning to look like broadway in britain as 
new york shows hit london in a reversal of the usual westward flow 
no fewer than 10 recent new york productions are now running in 
london or will open shortly including some that failed financially 
in the united states and others that might seem unlikely candidates 
for british transfers 
american plays and musicals have always been featured on the 
london stage from arthur miller plays some of which are now 
running to musical revivals such as the current brigadoon and 
the recently closed south pacific and cancan 
but whats surprising about the rest of the american lineup is 
its specific resemblance to that of new yorks current fare among 
american shows already running are the offbroadway musical three 
guys naked from the waist down at the donmar warehouse david 
mamets broadway hit speedtheplow at the governmentsubsidized 
national and the twocharacter a walk in the woods at the 
comedy which ended its commercially unsuccessful broadway run last 
june 
soon to arrive are standup comic jackie masons solo show the 
world according to me which starts its sixweek run feb 15 at 
the playhouse the satiric revue forbidden broadway opening 
march 2 at the fortune and subtitled the west end edition and 
robert harlings steel magnolias due march 7 at the lyric 
add the spring premieres of m butterfly frankie and 
johnny in the clair de lune and jerry zaks spirited revival of 
anything goes and clearly what plays in new york is 
increasingly deemed a safe bet to play in london 
mason appeared to prove the point in november when his brief 
appearance on the annual royal variety show won universal critical 
acclaim until then new york jewish shtick invariably bombed in 
britain 
part of the sudden interest in american productions is that they 
fill the gap left by those british playwrights who are either 
writing less frequently or have switched to other media 
in shopping for products creators and producers emphasize that 
their work transcends parochial national boundaries 
im doing steel magnolias because i think this is a 
particular play thats universal said david pugh who is 
producing the british debut of the longrunning offbroadway hit set 
in a louisiana beauty parlor 
directed by actress julia mckenzie the comedy will star 
britishborn rosemary harris a broadway regular and joely 
richardson the younger of vanessa redgraves two thespian daughters 
it happens to be as relevant in stokeontrent as it is in 
louisiana said pugh who in 1987 coproduced lyle kesslers 
orphans an earlier london production of an american play and 
one which closed at a deficit 
in the case of speedtheplow david mamet is seen as an 
international writer who merits inclusion in the repertory of any 
major theater 
he has very much been a writer for the national said david 
aukin executive director of the theater where the authors pulitzer 
prizewinning glengarry glen ross had its world premiere in 1983 
speedtheplow which starred ron silver joe mantegna and 
rock singer madonna who was roasted by critics opens jan 25 with a 
mixed canadian and british cast 
american writers in turn enjoy the prestige of a london run 
terrence mcnally whose frankie and johnny in the clair de lune 
is in its second year offbroadway said he was as excited about 
that plays london opening in may as he would be if it were the new 
york debut 
the london productions twocharacter cast consists of britons 
brian cox and julie walters who was rita in educating rita 
london is very special to me its not just another 
engagement mcnally 49 said by telephone from new york 
dismissing worries that a romance set in hells kitchen might be too 
american to travel 
i cant worry about that when i write he said shows work 
when youre very specific its when you try to appeal to everybody 
that you get into trouble 
mcnallys musical the rink flopped in london last year as it 
had earlier on broadway 
the fate of the rink and orphans indicates that london 
productions arent always the moneymakers dreamed of by scarred 
veterans of new yorks hitflop mentality 
neither follies the 1971 stephen sondheim musical which ends 
its debut london engagement feb 4 nor driving miss daisy the 
alfred uhry comedy which finished six months on the west end last 
november fully recouped its investment but the west ends lower 
costs are appealing both steel magnolias and forbidden 
broadway the west end edition cost 200000 pounds 375000 
dollars equal to or less than the price of todays average 
offbroadway show 
the theatrical traffic is not of course entirely one way 
shirley valentine the onewoman play by liverpudlian willy 
russell opens at broadways booth theater on feb 16 
such london hits as lend me a tenor written by an american 
and run for your wife open in march on broadway and peter 
shaffers muchawaited lettice and lovage has been postponed for 
broadway until next season because its star maggie smith has 
broken a shoulder

it was just like old times when john melcher 
got together with agribusiness consultant martin sorkin for lunch at 
the watergate the other day 
with one glaring exception 
i told him that this time i would pay and i did indeed 
pay confesses the 64yearold democrat who last november lost 
his bid for a third senate term from montana 
gone are the days when melcher an affable whitehaired 
veterinarian known as doc could assume that the lunch tab would 
be picked up by someone else 
they used to call me says the democratic veteran of 12 years 
in the house and seven in the senate now i call them 
it was a close election a turnaround of 7000 votes would have 
given melcher a new sixyear lease on his senate office 
but melcher ran into a gop challenger conrad burns who was a 
popular farm broadcaster at a time when his own base in the grain 
belt was getting shaky after four years of drought and unpopular 
policies blamed on washington 
television ads featuring talking cows that boosted melcher in 
1982 proved a bust this time in a state anxious to shed its bucolic 
image and spotlight an aboveaverage education level as a means to 
lure new hightech industries 
melcher also declares ruefully that he played into republican 
hands in dealing with a sensitive bill to preserve montana 
wilderness areas he ended up losing support among both 
conservations and the lumber industry 
when the election was over so was melchers congressional 
career his colleagues gave him a loyal sendoff 
he has protected the rights of farmers in montana and fought 
for fairness in public power systems declared sen christopher 
dodd dconn in a farewell to melcher from the senate floor 
fast eddie and abigail a pair of cats that had romped through 
his office at will in happier times also had to go an aide took 
one and the senator himself bundled the other into his car and took 
it to live in his suburban maryland home 
then melcher sat down to write letters and make phone calls on 
behalf of aides already looking for new jobs about half are now 
employed while others are still hunting or have decided the time has 
come to retire 
melcher himself is not planning to retire and there are two 
reasons why 
i have to earn some money he says i can live off my 
retirement in montana but if i want to stay here ive got to do 
something 
moving back to montana he says would provide him with a more 
pleasant place to live but that would mean saying goodbye to the 
issues that he has been campaigning for over almost two decades 
that is the second reason why he refuses to retire 
working off a borrowed desk in a downtown law firm melcher is 
offering his services as a consultant on those issues that is as a 
lobbyist 
well call it what you may he says i think we have a 
tendency to say consult but its lobbying 
in that melcher is like scores of former lawmakers who stay on 
in washington after they retire or lose elections they move into 
downtown suites and earn their living as hired guns in the 
neverending battle of gucci gulch 
senate rules designed to head off conflicts of interest bar 
melcher from contacting his former senate colleagues about bills for 
one year but he is free to testify when their committees hold 
hearings on bills and he is free to ply the corridors of the 
agriculture department on behalf of clients 
melcher already has one client the society for animal protection 
legislation 
i have a profound interest in the wellbeing of primates that 
are used in medical experiments says melcher he says they 
deserve decent surroundings and the company of their fellow 
creatures 
a broader plan melcher is working on would establish a coalition 
to fight potential cuts in the food for peace program an 
agriculture department export subsidy designed to give grain 
companies an incentive to provide food for the hungry people of the 
world 
those are the two items im working on now says melcher who 
pauses to reflect for a moment then adds im open to others

cowfers former instructor he consoled her patiently explained how 
to correct her blunder and even drew diagrams and mailed them to her 
within a few months she was done three bedrooms two baths 
passive solar heat and a jacuzzi and all for 55000 about 
onethird market value 
they not only give you the information they give you the 
confidence cowfer said you dont need building experience 
for 15 years hennin his wife patsy and several other 
instructors have taught students how to tackle the forbidding task 
of building a home at less than half the cost of buying the 
finished home or hiring someone to build it 
people who build their own homes are more satisfied hennin said 
less hurried than a contractor the doityourselfer will examine 
every aspect of the building process and make carefully considered 
decisions 
contractors dont shop around and generally do not match 
solutions to specific problems he said the contractor simply 
does it this way because thats the way theyve always done it 
more than 14000 students from around the world including 
novices who barely knew which end of the hammer to hold have 
attended the school located in a 120yearold brick building in this 
coastal town north of portland the students range in age from 18 to 
70 and have included lumberjacks doctors madison avenue 
executives carpenters engineers and architects 
students can choose the 15week onedayaweek session for 450 
per person or 725 per couple or opt for compressed sessions of two 
or three weeks for slightly more money classes are limited to 40 
students 
all students learn how to survey a lot pour a foundation design 
and build every inch of a house they also receive instruction in 
the concept of heat the physics of materials engineering framing 
and financing 
the information was presented in such a way that it was 
nonintimidating said gary miers 34 who is spending 50000 to 
build a house valued at 140000 in raymond it was presented in a 
relaxed fashion 
mistakes arent ruinous hennin said because there isnt 
anything in a house that isnt forgiving 
thats comforting for students who also quickly learn that the 
mistakes they make are much less costly than if a contractor were 
building the house 
when a contractor walks into a store he doesnt ask what the 
price is he just assumes hes getting the wholesale cost but the 
price may be lower elsewhere hennin said contractors dont shop 
around 
for example a shelter institute student can make insulated glass 
windows for about 3 per square foot whereas a contractor is likely 
to pay 10 hennin said all the lumber to build a house rarely 
would be over 4000 he added 
the hennins both 45 began their business in 1974 hennin who 
had just finished law school and had some prior building experience 
was hired to help build a house for a friend soon he had other 
offers to build and his wifes interest in home construction 
surfaced 
we had a choice of building houses for the rest of our lives or 
getting involved in another way teaching people mrs hennin 
said 
housing styles have changed over the last 15 years after the 
simple boxstyle homes that marked the days of energy conservation 
and the backtotheearth movement of the early and mid1970s 
underground homes became popular those now have been replaced by 
elaborate designs more reflective of the 1980s prosperity 
sophistication and selfindulgence mrs hennin said 
jim and roxie westbrook of santa cruz calif are building a 
passivesolar country house on the outskirts of the nearby henry 
cowell redwoods state park complete with a hot tub and more gadgets 
and fixtures than they had in the older homes they owned 
theres nothing cheap in it mrs westbrook said in a 
telephone interview when its a choice between quality and going 
for quality we go for quality 
others prefer a home that is unadorned miers and his wife left 
pennsylvania with the romantic notion of building a home that 
embraced their 1960s values the desire to be independent 
energyefficient and frugal 
but despite changing tastes mrs hennin says most people are 
joined by a creative urge and a determination to take control of 
their lives 
its a grabbing of life rather than letting life roll you 
over she said if houses cost so much its your responsibility 
to figure out a way for them not to cost so much

meshach taylor might never have become an 
actor or found his way onto cbss designing women if he hadnt 
gotten bored as a political reporter 
taylor costars on the hit comedy show as anthony bouvier the 
only regular man among the four beautiful women 
he started acting in community shows in new orleans where his 
father was dean of students at dillard university he continued 
doing roles in indianapolis after his father moved to indiana 
university as dean of the college of arts and sciences 
an early marriage while attending florida aampm university forced 
taylor to look for work later when his first daughter was born he 
moved back to indianapolis 
i got a flunky job on an fm station he said they had no 
news at night so i figured i could do a threeminute news report i 
was the only black person at the station so they let me do it i 
became a rip and reader it expanded to five minutes 
pretty soon i was working days i was on the political beat 
with experienced reporters then i became the state house reporter 
it was interesting for a while but once you get involved in indiana 
politics you see what a yawn it is 
after that he set up a black arts theater to keep kids off the 
street then joined the national touring company of hair his 
acting career was launched after hair he became a part of the 
burgeoning theater world in chicago and stayed for eight years 
until 1979 
taylor played the assistant director in buffalo bill the 
shortlived nbc show in 198384 about an unbelievably arrogant and 
selfcentered talk show host played by dabney coleman 
he did guest star roles on such shows as lou grant the 
white shadow and mash it seemed that his role on 
designing women would also be a oneshot for producer linda 
bloodworththomason 
it was for the thanksgiving show about halfway through the 
first season taylor said linda said if the character goes id 
be back i was off the next week then i went back the next week and 
ive been there ever since my first show i was just an excon on a 
workrelease program 
sometimes real life works its way into the shows 
we were doing some promotional work in lubbock texas and 
somehow delta burke and i got booked into the same hotel suite he 
said i said i was a married man so i called my wife and she 
called her boyfriend gerald mcraney when we got back i told linda 
and she put it into a show we got stranded at a motel during a 
blizzard and ended up in the same bed another time i had to help 
delta get dressed 
taylors role on designing women has grown as anthony has 
grown into a more responsible person hes now studying and will 
soon have his college degree 
the roles gotten more substantial both in the amount of work 
and in the depth of what anthony says said taylor hes not 
just the wisecracker 
taylor said he was much too young when he got married in college 
i never considered id have to get a job he said what kind 
of a job can a black man without a college education get in 
tallahassee i got a job in a crate factory on the night shift 
making 135 an hour there were no safety precautions 
it was a nightmare the people who ran the place couldnt 
handle that i was working and going to college that was too much 
ambition for a black man my next job was a bellman at a hotel 
everyone else was a bellboy but since i was in college i was a 
bellman that was a good job 
taylor also has been in such movies as a wedding stoney 
island damien omen two another saturday night house 
of games and mannequin 
a sequel to mannequin a comedy remake of one touch of 
venus is in the works playwright david mamet a friend from his 
chicago theater days wrote house of games and has a new movie 
script called cops and robbers

the stately mansions of northline drive and 
the refurbished fishing camps of bucktown have things in common a 
fear of crime a loathing for property taxes and david duke 
campaign signs on the lawns 
duke 38 formerly imperial wizard of the ku klux klan and now 
head of the national association for the advancement of white 
people led a sevencandidate field on jan 21 in the first primary 
election for a state legislature seat 
the district made up of old metairie is flanked on one side 
by an exclusive country club and the milliondollar mansions of 
northline drive and on the other by what was a fishing village 
before urban sprawl in between are neighborhoods of 
turnofthecentury wood frame homes and 1960s ranchstyle dwellings 
the electorate is a mix of affluence bluecollar workers and 
young professionals moving to the quiet suburb in search of better 
schools and a safer environment and 996 percent of them are white 
duke polled 33 percent of the vote runnerup john treen had 19 
percent treen 62 is the brother of dave treen who served from 
19801984 as the states only republican governor since 
reconstruction 
the firstprimary victory sends notice that the political wind 
is changing in this country and that the great american middle class 
is going to speak up for its interest duke said 
the runoff is set for feb 18 and his showing has louisiana 
residents abuzz gov buddy roemer said it would be a blot on the 
states image if duke managed to win the election the new 
yorkbased jewish defense organization says a team of disrupters is 
headed to louisiana to prevent that 
duke left the klan eight years ago after being accused of selling 
secret klan membership rolls the alleged transaction was revealed 
by bill wilkerson imperial wizard of another fiercely jealous 
klan faction 
duke today disavows violence and denies hes a racist his 
platform includes three major planks no alteration of the states 
homestead exemption which exempts from property taxes any home 
worth 75000 or less abolition of minority setasides and welfare 
reform to discourage illegitimate births 
jefferson parish sheriff harry lee said there might be racial 
overtones to a platform that should not be described as overtly 
racist i do not want the message to go out that the vote in my 
parish was for a racist the fact is that there are some social and 
economic issues that may have created a backlash 
hes talking economic issues and social issues that 80 percent 
of the voters in this parish respond to 
lee said he was similarly misinterpreted three years ago when he 
instructed a roving task force of deputies to stop and question 
blacks found cruising the allwhite neighborhoods at night he 
rescinded the order but said that for the next several weeks 96 
percent of the mail i received was favorable 
more recently the jefferson parish council erected a barricade 
across a street linking a predominantly black new orleans 
neighborhood to a predominantly white neighborhood in jefferson 
parish 
new orleans mayor sidney barthelemy ordered the barricade torn 
down and jefferson parish officials let it stay down 
there were 25 murders in the first 23 days of this year in new 
orleans a band of young blacks chanting no whites on canal 
street assaulted whites on the street after a martin luther king 
day parade just days before the election 
duke insists his campaign is free of racism i believe in equal 
rights for all people i truly believe in it i refer to myself as a 
civil rights activist dedicated to everyones civil rights 
during his klan years which began when he was a student at john 
f kennedy high school here duke was interviewed by tom snyder and 
barbara walters among hundreds of other reporters almost 
unanimously interviewers came away with the uneasy feeling duke 
was at least unsettling one background check disclosed a score of 
173 on an iq test putting him in the genius category 
duke appeared on more than 200 talk shows in at least nine 
countries during the late 1970s and spoke at more than a hundred 
colleges for up to 1200 the appearances were marked by his calm 
detached rational delivery of extreme beliefs 
he honed his declamatory skills at free speech alley a student 
forum at louisiana state university and peppers his conversations 
with quotations from william shakespeare benjamin franklin martin 
luther and others 
duke has been arrested at least twice once in jefferson parish 
on charges of inciting a riot in 1978 and once two years ago for 
blocking a highway and reckless conduct during a demonstration in 
forsyth county ga he was sentenced to six months on the jefferson 
parish charge and fined 55 in georgia with a 12month sentence 
suspended on a promise to stay out of the state for a year 
earlier he led scotland yard on a chase across england while 
appearing on television shows scheduling interviews and holding 
cross burnings the police wanted to oust him as an undesirable but 
they couldnt catch him 
he vowed to run for president in 1979 but didnt he ran last 
year and got on the ballot in several states even though he was 
denied official recognition by the national democratic party he 
polled 18612 votes in his home state compared to 15 million for 
george bush and michael dukakis 
before last weeks primary his best race was in 1976 for a 
vacant seat in the louisiana senate he polled 11000 votes a third 
of those cast he had 3995 votes last week treen who ran with the 
endorsement of the parish republican organization polled 2277 
votes 
the klan is far behind me duke said but the effort for 
equal rights for everybody is ahead of me

advocates and opponents of racial quotas to 
remedy bias agree that a new supreme court decision in a richmond 
va case will affect significantly the future of affirmative action 
here in questionandanswer form is a look at the courts 
decision and likely impact 
q what did the court do 
a the justices by a 63 vote struck down a fiveyear program 
adopted by the richmond va city council that required whiteowned 
companies bidding on any city contract to set aside 30 percent of 
the contracts value for minorityowned subcontractors 
q why was the program invalidated 
a justice sandra day oconnor writing for the court said 
richmonds plan was based on a general claim of racial bias in the 
construction industry she said there was no proof statistical or 
otherwise to back up that assertion 
the decision said rigid racial quotas must be supported by 
evidence for example that blackowned enterprises tried to obtain 
construction contracts but were denied them 
without such evidence the use of racial quotas violate the 
equalprotection rights of whites 
q why was the opinion so bitterly denounced by the courts three 
most liberal members led by its only black justice thurgood 
marshall 
a marshall said the court adopted a sweeping standard that could 
doom a whole range of affirmative action programs he called the 
ruling a giant step backward for the courts longstanding 
commitment to racial equality 
q what standard did the court adopt 
a for the first time in more than a decade of deciding 
affirmative action disputes the court said racial preferences 
adopted by governmental agencies must be given strict scrutiny 
that standard previously applied only to minorities claims 
that they are victims of discrimination means that plans to 
benefit blacks hispanics and other such groups automatically will 
be suspect 
a state or local government program giving preferences to 
minorities will be struck down unless there is a compelling 
governmental interest to justify it and the program is narrowly 
tailored to remedy the identified abuse in practice strict 
scrutiny generally dooms a governments initiative 
q how common are socalled setasides like the one richmond 
adopted 
a thirtysix states and 190 cities earmark public funds in this 
fashion for minorities 
q are federal programs affected 
a the court specifically exempted setasides approved by federal 
law the court said congress has unique power under the constitution 
to enact such programs 
in 1980 the justices upheld a law that earmarked 10 percent of 
federally funded public works contracts to minority groups 
q does the decision affect affirmative action programs beyond 
setasides 
a the ruling did not deal with affirmative action quotas for 
hiring and promotions but civil rights groups expressed concern the 
ruling will discourage states and cities from beginning or expanding 
all plans to help minorities 
q does the ruling affect private businesses 
a it only applies directly to actions by state and local 
government the ruling was based on equalprotection guarantees in 
the constitution aimed at protecting against government abuses not 
those by private citizens 
q does the ruling mean the court is becoming more conservative 
on affirmative action 
a former president reagans three appointees to the court plus 
william h rehnquist promoted to chief justice by reagan joined 
nonreagan appointees justices byron r white and john paul stevens 
in striking down the richmond plan 
stevens is always unpredictable but the other five appear to be 
forging a more reliable conservative consensus 
of particular note is the presence of the courts newest member 
anthony m kennedy in the majority kennedy replaced retired 
justice lewis f powell a moderate conservative whose vote often 
was decisive on affirmative action 
q what has the court said in the past about affirmative action 
a with many twists and turns and splintered voting the court 
generally has upheld the principle of affirmative action 
its decisions date back to 1978 when it said educational programs 
may give preferential treatment to racial minorities and women to 
make up for past discrimination at the same time the court struck 
down a rigid racial quota that denied allan bakke a white man 
admission to a california medical school 
more recent decisions have forced a union to double its 
nonwhite membership upheld a federal court consent decree 
reserving half the promotions in a city fire department for 
qualified minority candidates and upheld a courtordered plan 
requiring promotion of equal numbers of black and white state police 
troopers 
the court also has said a public employer may give preference to 
a woman marginally less qualified than a man applying for the same 
job 
q could there be a silver lining for minorities in the richmond 
case 
a some civil rights activists say the ruling gives state and 
local officials with the political will to act a road map for 
adopting a constitutional affirmative action plan this newfound 
clarity means that carefully drawn plans will be acceptable they 
say 
they also applauded the courts rejection of a more restrictive 
approach one that would have limited preferential treatment to 
only those individuals who could prove they were victims of past 
discrimination

a new age of harmony in foreign policy is going 
to be elusive and fragile even with the republican white house and 
the senates top democrat working to create it 
it will take more than bipartisanship because the most divisive 
and intractable policy disputes of the era were not partisan in the 
first place they hinged instead on the powers of congress and the 
executive branch to make or risk war in a time of limited conflicts 
surgical strikes terrorism and most recently naval escort 
missions for reflagged kuwaiti ships in the persian gulf 
senate majority leader george mitchell said defense is a 
responsibility shared by the president and congress but in recent 
years it sometimes seemed as if we were opposing each other rather 
than exercising shared powers that need not be 
his words meshed with presidents bushs inaugural call for a new 
era of cooperation and unity 
the challenge is to define the shared powers so as to satisfy 
congress without intruding on authority presidents always have 
reserved as their own 
mitchell said bipartisanship cannot be made real by words 
alone or by good intentions 
it requires deeds to match words action to carry out intention 
shared responsibility 
the new majority leader asked bush to make congress a partner 
in policy formulation acknowledging that even that wont prevent 
differences between the two branches of government but in the 
great eras of american leadership the differences have been less 
important than the agreements mitchell said 
a generation ago a democratic administration and an 
overwhelmingly democratic congress clashed in the dispute that gave 
rise to the rest the undeclared war in vietnam 
that war cleaves us still bush said in his inaugural 
address but friends that war began in earnest a quarter of a 
century ago and surely the statute of limitations has been 
reached 
five years after that divisive war drove president lyndon b 
johnson into retirement congress sought to assert its authority 
with the war powers resolution sponsored by a liberal republican 
senator vetoed by a republican president overridden by a 
democratic congress it says that presidents cant sent us forces 
into potential war zones for more than 90 days unless congress 
approves 
that remains on the books never fully invoked but often debated 
the issue is power not partisanship presidents inevitably guard 
what they deem to be the prerogatives of a commander in chief 
since the war powers resolution was adopted in 1973 over the veto 
of richard m nixon two more republican presidents and one democrat 
have argued as he did that it is unconstitutional and can undermine 
us action in time of crisis 
the war powers resolution requires that the president notify 
congress within 48 hours whenever he sends combatready troops 
overseas when they are sent into conflict or situations where 
imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated they 
must be withdrawn within 60 days unless congress votes to keep them 
there 90 days if the president certifies in writing that the extra 
time is vital to safe withdrawal 
that law never has been fully invoked although often debated 
critics of president reagans escort policy in the persian gulf 
tried seven times to get congressional action that would have 
compelled the administration to invoke the act then they went to 
court and lost there too the administration insisted war powers 
didnt apply even after 37 sailors were killed when an iraqi 
missile hit the uss stark 
only congress has the power to declare war but that hasnt 
happened since the united states entered world war ii the day after 
pearl harbor korea and vietnam were undeclared wars situations 
like those in lebanon grenada the attack on libya defy even that 
description 
we find that we are drawn into smaller conflicts where the 
lines between active hostilities and uneasy truce are unclear 
mitchell said that was the case in the persian gulf last year it 
will be the case in other places in the future 
our system should ensure that when force is necessary it is 
used surely and for goals clear to all of us he said 
mitchell said that was the idea behind the war powers resolution 
but that it has become a point of contention and stalemate leaders 
of both parties want it revised probably eliminating the withdrawal 
deadlines in favor of regular white house consultation with a 
designated panel of congressional leaders on national security 
policy

michael r milken the embattled junk bond chief 
of drexel burnham lambert inc is being cut off from the firm 
without most of his pay according to the plea bargain drexel 
struck to settle the nations largest securities fraud case 
the bad news for milken considered the driving force behind 
drexels leap from wall street obscurity came in a 12page plea 
agreement signed by drexel officials tuesday and made public 
wednesday 
milkens attorney condemned the deal as punishment without 
trial sentence before verdict 
drexel also agreed it would not pay milkens brother senior 
company aide lowell j milken half of what is due him in 1988 
both milkens were named along with drexel in a securities and 
exchange commission insider trading civil lawsuit in september 
neither brother has been charged with any criminal activity and 
both have denied wrongdoing but michael milken is considered one of 
the biggest remaining targets of the investigation and is expected 
to be indicted soon on racketeering and fraud charges 
milken heads drexels beverly hills califbased high yield 
junk bond department and is one of the most dynamic financiers 
of the decade said to be one of the countrys wealthiest people 
milken reportedly makes 200 million a year mostly in a yearly 
bonus paid in the following year 
denying him most of his 1988 money not only would seriously crimp 
milkens legaldefense war chest but would go a long way toward 
defraying the cost of drexels own settlement of criminal charges 
the agreement also required drexel to pay 500 million of the 
650 million penalty on the day it enters a guilty plea a date 
which us attorney rudolph giuliani said will not be set until 
after the sec approves the settlement 
a drexel lawyer said that approval may be worked out by early 
next week according to a court transcript unsealed wednesday 
we are meeting with them almost on daily basis eight or nine 
hours a day drexel lawyer thomas f curnin told us district 
judge kimba wood tuesday 
and we may well have an agreement with the sec particularly if 
we work through the weekend by next monday or tuesday he added 
according to the transcript 
drexel also must pay 85 percent interest on the initial 500 
million up until the day it enters a guilty plea 
there is no change in mr milkens position and his attorneys 
are continuing to prepare to defend him against any charges that may 
be brought said defense lawyer martin flumenbaum adding that the 
agreements provisions requiring drexel to fire milken and to 
refuse to pay him the compensation for his service due in 1988 is a 
violation of due process and an infringement of mr milkens 
constitutional rights 
drexel chief executive fred joseph has consistently maintained 
he has no indication lowell milken did anything wrong said 
defense lawyer michael armstrong 
he added drexel has been forced to punish some one it has 
characterized as blameless in order to avoid being put out of 
business by a ruinous racketeering indictment 
drexel the nations fifthlargest securities firm agreed to 
plead guilty to six felony charges and pay a record 650 million in 
fines and restitution the specific counts revealed by federal 
prosecutors tuesday included allegations of illegal dealings with 
disgraced stock speculator ivan f boesky and the defunct securities 
firm princetonnewport partners 
the plea bargain agreement does not provide any protection 
whatsoever from criminal prosecution or civil liability to any 
individual or to entity other than drexel it said in part 
the agreement called for drexel to pay 300 million in criminal 
fines and civil penalties the remaining 350 million will be placed 
in an escrow account that will be used to compensate civil 
claimants who may sue over losses sustained by drexels actions

employee on a leave of absence and fire them if they are convicted 
so far no current drexel employee has been indicted in the twoyear 
probe

michael milken was the engine that 
propelled drexel burnham lambert inc up through the ranks of the 
securities business but the junk bond trader may have become excess 
baggage 
drexel revealed wednesday it will fire milken as part of a record 
650 million plea bargain with federal prosecutors who charged the 
wall street firm with securities fraud 
the junk bond market milken nurtured through a decade is crucial 
to drexels profitability but it was unclear how milkens departure 
would affect the firms role in the market 
and in one very real sense jettisoning the chief of the beverly 
hillsbased division drexel refers to as the highyield bond unit 
helps the firm out of its present straits the plea agreement calls 
for the firm to withhold milkens 1988 salary and bonuses which at 
an estimated 200 million is enough to pay a sizeable chunk of the 
fine 
the los angelesborn trader is widely credited with 
singlehandedly persuading investors that there was gold in 
highyield highrisk bonds issued by companies too small or too 
weak to earn the endorsement of bondrating firms he preached the 
idea that a junk bond investor could earn high interest and protect 
himself from potential default of one company by holding a portfolio 
of bonds in a number of companies 
drexel made millions as the dominant firm in the junk bond 
market which has funded corporate raiders and struggling 
entrepreneurs alike 
milken who got the firm to allow him to set up shop in 
california was said to control a network of investors often a 
businessman who had financed his dreams by selling junk bonds became 
a ready buyer for another companys bonds when pitched by milken 
but there are indications his role as the indispensable engine of 
the junk bond market and so his value to drexel has diminished 
by some accounts milken has spent little time in his beverly 
hills office during the two years it was publicly known drexel was a 
target of federal fraud investigations 
yet despite inroads made by other firms drexel has remained the 
acknowledged leader in the junk bond market

the boeing co may have been too ambitious 
in its schedule for introducing its new 747400 jumbo jet a top 
boeing commercial airplanes executive says 
the expression that hindsight is perfect applies you can 
always look back and see things you could do better phil condit 
the boeing divisions executive vice president for engineering and 
production said wednesday in an interview 
boeing had hoped to get the first of the new planes to customers 
by late last year but a series of glitches has delayed the delivery 
schedule three times and increasingly impatient customers still 
havent got the initial planes 
in bringing out the 747400 the worlds largest commercial 
jetliner boeing in effect was introducing four aircraft models 
simultaneously condit said some 21 operators have ordered 166 of 
the new planes which will be capable of carrying 412 passengers 
more than 8000 miles nonstop 
the plane can be ordered with one of three different types of 
engines and in a combination freightpassenger configuration each 
variation had to be certified with the federal avation 
administration in addition condit said each of the customers 
signed up for the planes wants the jets customized 
thats a big complex task condit said if i had it to do 
over again i would have spread some of that out 
condit is meeting with groups of reporters this week to answer 
questions about boeing production delays and recent troubles that 
have plagued boeing aircraft 
among incidents in recent weeks an older eastern 737 made an 
unscheduled landing after losing cabin pressure from a fuselage 
hole a new british midlands 737400 crashed in great britain after 
one engine failed and another was shut off an engine fell off a 
piedmont 737200 which landed safely in chicago and a wing panel 
came off an eastern 757 
in addition the faa ordered checks for possible crosswiring in 
cargo hold fire extinguishers on 757s and 767s eight instances of 
crosswiring were found on 757s the latest last week on a plane 
owned by the mexican government but none have been found so far on 
the 767 widebodies 
boeing said tuesday that inspections had been completed on 98 
percent of the worlds fleet of 479 737300s and 16 737400s and no 
wiring problems had been found the checks were ordered as a 
precaution after it was speculated that crosswired engines might 
have contributed to the british midlands crash 
what we have had is a set of very unrelated incidents they 
flat arent connected at all except by one thing and thats time 
condit said 
in october boeing told its 747400 customers that wiring 
problems would delay deliveries of the first 20 or so jets but the 
schedule would be back on track early in 1989 a second delay 
occurred in december when it took longer than expected for the faa 
to certify the planes last week boeing again said it was 
reexamining its delivery schedule and would tell customers by the 
end of january when to expect their planes 
condit refused to say what the revised schedule would be or 
whether some deliveries would be bumped from 1989 to 1990 saying 
boeing would be contacting its customers this week so they could 
know first boeings annual earnings report will be out monday and 
it will contain an estimate of 1989 aircraft delivery levels he 
said 
boeing last week also completed a fiveday readjustment of 
boeings 747400 line to catch up work and get it back in sequence 
condit said a similar threeday readjustment took place in october 
and in december some employees worked on the plane through their 
christmas break 
weve started out on a new very large complex program 
condit said while youd like every program to go perfectly when 
you do big programs they dont all go perfectly weve had some part 
shortages we have some work that got out of sequence 
asked whether boeings credibility was hurt by its troubles 
condit said no 
the airlines themselves understand the process the 
fundamentals of this business is one its very visible and two 
whatever happens you set out to go fix it i think thats boeings 
record when you have a problem go fix it

darby williams can play violin piano 
marimba cello you name it composes a pretty good song too not 
bad for someone who can barely put one note in front of the other 
williams is president of breakaway music systems of san mateo 
calif manufacturer of a new product dubbed the vocalizer 1000 a 
real break for the tone deaf 
if you can hum you play the vocalizer you dont even have to 
hum very well 
i had a terrible time trying to play the clarinet when i was 
young said williams 35 i wasnt much better at the guitar 
the vocalizer which sells for 300 is capable of producing 
music from 28 preset lead instruments plus five drum sounds all 
the owner needs to do is plug it into a stereo and add the voice 
it may sound like a hightech kazoo but the vocalizer is far 
more sophisticated than that williams said 
it was initially designed for the amateur musician but now the 
professionals are buying it he said after a recent demonstration 
to a potential buyer who couldnt carry a tune in a bucket its a 
home studio to them because it has a midin and out that lets them 
hook up their synthesizers 
the unit also operates on batteries so theres no getting away 
from the moment of inspiration 
the wouldbe customer picked up the microphone and hummed some 
cole porter and chopin the grand polonaise sounded a bit 
different played on a steel drum instead of a piano night and 
day didnt sound as good but it was evident a little practice 
would help 
the better you get the more you can do said williams 
the technology was developed by marcian hoff inventor of the 
microprocessor williams met him when the two worked at the video 
game concern atari corp in 1984 
last year the two obtained a patent for voice guide the process 
that lets the voice trigger notes that will be in tune with the 
background instruments 
the blackcolored unit was designed by frogdesign harmut 
esslinger inc of campbell calif which designed apples macintosh 
computer 
breakaway started selling the vocalizer in the upscale sharper 
image catalog in november and since then has sold thousands on 
thousands of them said williams who added he couldnt be more 
specific because of company policy 
williams has hired six other people and expects revenues to be in 
the tens of millions by christmas he said

the us dollar declined slightly today against the 
japanese yen and the tokyo stock exchanges leading index fell back 
from its record high of the previous day 
dealers said the foreign exchange and stock markets both were 
affected by bank of japan governor satoshi sumitas comment 
wednesday that the central bank might take early action if 
necessary to curb inflation in japan this was taken as a hint of 
higher interest rates 
the dollar closed at 12752 yen down 013 yen from wednesdays 
close of 12765 yen after opening at 12737 it stayed in a narrow 
range between 12730 yen and 12760 yen in relatively quiet trading 
gov sumitas comment and the us federal reserve boards 
intervention to check the dollars rise discouraged players from 
actively buying the dollar said a dealer at a major bank in 
tokyo players were also worried about intervention by the bank of 
japan 
higher interest rates in japan would make the yen more attractive 
to investors 
on the stock market the nikkei stock average of 225 selected 
issues lost 5598 points or 018 percent closing at 3151181 
following a record high close of 3156779 on wednesday 
securities dealers said a bearish mood persisted in the stock 
market throughout the day because of investors fears of an interest 
rate hike 
trading was slow and not many shares were moving actively on 
the trading board today except automobile shares said a dealer at 
nikko securities co speaking on condition of anonymity 
profittaking activities were also notable today that probably 
pushed most shares down 
he added the market only took a brief relief today but i 
think the market environment is still favorable for most stocks

a temporary shift in the payment of social 
security benefits held last months budget deficit to less than half 
the level of a year earlier but economists still expect the 
shortfall for fiscal 1989 to exceed last years level 
decembers deficit was 116 billion down from 244 billion in 
the same month a year earlier the treasury department reported 
wednesday for the first three months of fiscal 1989 which began 
oct 1 the budget gap was 677 billion down 178 percent from the 
same period a year earlier 
michael k evans an economic consultant in washington 
attributed the improvement to an end of the year fluke in which 
social security checks that normally would have been mailed out in 
january 1988 went out at the end of the previous month artificially 
inflating the deficit for december 1987 
the fiscal 1989 deficit actually is running about as expected 
and should exceed last years 155 billion shortfall by about 10 
billion evans said 
while the deficit is expected to continue to grow in fiscal 1989 
with president bush unlikely to tame it the shortfall shouldnt 
hinder economic growth evans said 
its just not going to affect the economy he said i dont 
see this as a disaster 
the reagan administration in its final budget proposal this 
month projected a 1615 billion deficit for fiscal 1989 the 
congressional budget office meanwhile forecasts a 141 billion 
shortfall 
bush plans to detail his administrations priorities in an 
address to congress on feb 9 and to unveil his budget proposals 
shortly thereafter 
economists are forecasting slower growth in the second half of 
1989 and rising interest rates early in the year both of which 
hinder efforts to reduce the deficit weak growth slows tax 
collections while higher interest rates force the government to 
spend more to finance the 27 trillion national debt 
as usual the largest spending categories in december were the 
military social security other programs in the department of 
health and human services interest on the national debt and farm 
subsidies 
military spending totaled 282 billion last month and 773 
billion for the past three months up 4 percent from the same period 
a year earlier 
interest on the national debt totaled 35 billion in december and 
683 billion for the first three months of the fiscal year up 117 
percent from a year earlier 
spending for social security was 188 billion during december 
and 546 billion for the first three months of fiscal 1989 down 
209 percent from a year earlier because of the shift in payment 
dates 
other hhs programs including medicare and medicaid cost 147 
billion in december and 40 billion so far in the fiscal year up 6 
percent from the same period in fiscal 1988 
spending by the agriculture department totaled 49 billion in 
december and 16 billion for the first three months of fiscal 1989 
down 39 percent from the previous year

samuel k skinner one of the few washington 
outsiders named to president bushs cabinet is headed toward 
confirmation as transportation secretary after squelching a lone 
objection to his nomination 
the former us attorney who is an active pilot and administers 
the nations secondlargest mass transit system testified for 2 
hours wednesday before the senate commerce committee the chicago 
resident pledged support for mandatory drug testing a battle 
against air terrorists and promotion of competition in the nations 
air sea and land transportation 
committee chairman sen ernest hollings dsc said he was 
keeping the hearing record open until noon today for further comment 
but said he expected approval when the committee meets to vote on 
the nomination next tuesday a full senate vote would follow 
i dont think youll have any trouble next tuesday morning 
hollings told skinner 50 at the end of the hearing youve done 
a superb job youre a breath of fresh air 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio had tried to delay the 
confirmation hearing over questions about skinners actions as a 
us attorney in chicago in 1977 but withdrew his objection after 
speaking with skinner 
in his testimony skinner said he would fight for fairness for 
us airlines abroad even if it put him at odds with the state 
department 
i think weve got a right to compete in the world on an equal 
basis he said when asked about the difficulty encountered by 
us airlines seeking access to some airports abroad including 
tokyo even after diplomatic agreements are concluded 
im not going to take a back seat skinner said 
sen trent lott rmiss applauded skinners intention not to 
take orders from the state department saying dont let them 
shove you around 
it may be a little naive but thats the position were going 
to take said skinner although he also called himself a team 
player and said he would work with secretary of statedesignate 
james baker 
skinner said he supports random drug tests for transportation 
workers pledged to battle drunken driving promised to help build 
up the coast guard and the maritime industry and announced he would 
draw up a longrange national transportation policy 
several committee members urged that the government continue to 
subsidize air service to small airports that deregulated carriers 
otherwise might abandon skinner pledged to work with congress and 
said it would be foolish for the transportation department to end 
the service and then be forced to restore it 
no committee member raised an objection to the nomination or 
strongly questioned any of skinners statements 
metzenbaum had questioned skinners failure as a prosecutor in 
1977 to prosecute gd searle co on allegations that it falsified 
test results on its nutrasweet artificial sweetener 
skinner told the senators the decision not to prosecute was made 
by his successor he acknowledged some minor mistakes as he left 
office and joined the law firm that represented searle but said he 
had nothing to do with the searle case as a private lawyer 
metzenbaum said he was satisfied with the explanation and that he 
would vote for skinners confirmation

the united states has given the goahead to the 
soviet union for buying more us grain this year including 
subsidized wheat raising the possibility that total sales might 
exceed the record level of four years ago 
agriculture department officials said wednesday the soviets have 
been cleared to buy up to 20 million metric tons of grain in 
198889 up from the 16 million tons specified earlier purchases 
already total more than 12 million tons 
the department also said the soviets have bought an additional 
150000 tons of soybean meal which has a potential current market 
value of about 36 million 
under a longterm grain agreement the soviet union was 
originally limited to 12 million tons of us grain a year without 
further consultations with washington but that was increased to 16 
million tons on dec 23 the agreement had expired last sept 30 but 
was later extended 
officials said the increase for 198889 takes into account 
recent public confirmation by soviet authorities that the soviet 
unions grain harvest last year was below expectations 
in a related development acting undersecretary richard w 
goldberg announced that moscow has been authorized an additional 2 
million tons of wheat that it can buy under the departments export 
enhancement program or eep 
earlier this week for example the department announced an eep 
wheat sale to the soviet union of 635000 tons or about 233 
million bushels the subsidies shaved 2305 per ton off the regular 
market price or about 63 cents per bushel 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat 
the eep arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and 
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced 
prices in order to meet foreign competition the exporters then 
collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as 
bonuses or subsidies 
only wheat is approved for sale to the soviet union under the eep 
subsidy arrangement 
sales of wheat and corn now total more than 116 million tons for 
delivery in the longterm agreements sixth year which began last 
oct 1 
that comprises about 102 million tons of corn and 14 million 
tons of wheat in addition the soviets have bought 450000 tons of 
soybeans 128 million tons of soybean meal and 500000 tons of 
grain sorghums 
under the agreement each ton of soybeans or meal counts for two 
tons of grain 
if moscow buys the full 20 million tons of us grain now 
authorized it would exceed the record level of 186 million tons of 
198485 most of which was corn 
the current agreement was a 5year pact that began on oct 1 
1983 and then extended last fall through 1990 
under the pact the soviet union is committed to buy at least 9 
million tons of grain each year including a minimum of 4 million 
tons each of wheat and corn the remaining 1 million tons can be 
wheat corn soybeans or soybean meal or a combination of those 
commodities

superconducting materials can carry current by 
two mechanisms rather than one as some theories hold says a study 
published today 
the findings should help scientists figure out how 
superconductivity works researchers said 
superconductivity is the ability to carry electrical current 
without resistance scientists are trying to develop new 
superconductors that could be used in such applications as smaller 
and faster computers and floating highspeed trains 
but they still do not know just how superconductivity arises in 
socalled hightemperature superconductors which require less 
chilling than previous materials before they lose resistance 
university of tokyo researchers report in todays issue of the 
british journal nature that they developed a new family of compounds 
in which the current is carried by electrons which are tiny charged 
particles 
in previously known hightemperature superconductors the charge 
was carried instead by roving areas called holes that lack 
electrons they said 
electricity is a flow of electrons the idea of current being 
carried by holes can be visualized if one imagines a row of cars 
parked along a curb with an empty parking space at the head 
if the lead car moves up to fill that space then the second car 
moves up to take the first cars spot and so on until all the cars 
have moved one could say all the cars moved ahead because an empty 
parking space or a hole moved in the opposite direction 
proposed explanations of superconductivity have disagreed over 
whether holes were the only possible carriers of current said 
princeton university theorist philip anderson 
the japanese research casts doubt on widely accepted theories 
that only holes can carry current anderson said in a telephone 
interview 
that will help physicists sort out the competing explanations for 
superconductivity said northwestern university physicist arthur 
freeman 
among the other theories are those that focus on a sea of 
electrons within a material when it is not superconducting with 
the idea that those electrons are easily excited by an electric 
field to carry a current he said 
the japanese work will also permit new ways to test theories 
about what causes superconductivity physicist victor emery of the 
brookhaven national laboratory in upton ny wrote in a nature 
editorial 
the japanese materials contain copper oxygen and an element 
called cerium along with one of three other elements praseodymium 
neodymium or samarium

orders to factories for big ticket durable 
goods shot up 64 percent in december the biggest increase in six 
months the government reported today 
the commerce department said demand for durable goods items 
expected to last three or more years totaled a seasonally adjusted 
13085 billion in december 
the 64 percent jump was the biggest since an 87 percent 
increase recorded last june it reflected widespread demand in both 
civilian and military categories 
the december orders figure closed out the year on a strong note 
with orders for the last 12 months totaling 143 trillion a 108 
percent increase from 1987 
it was the best showing since a 123 percent increase in 1984 
orders had edged up a slight 12 percent in 1985 and 04 percent in 
1986 two years in which american busineses were losing domestic and 
overseas sales to foreign manufacturers 
american manufacturing enjoyed a rebound in 1987 and 1988 as a 
decline in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies made 
us products competitive once again on overseas markets 
orders in the volatile military category influenced by when big 
government contracts are signed jumped 211 percent in december to 
a seasonally adjusted 1016 billion following a 215 percent 
decrease in november 
but even excluding defense orders for durable goods were up 54 
percent during the month 
orders for nondefense capital goods shot up as well rising 78 
percent to 386 billion last month the category is closely watched 
for signals of business intentions to expand and modernize 
decembers increase in demand for nondefense capital goods was 
the biggest since a 125 percent jump in june 
in another volatile category transportation orders increased 20 
percent in december to 389 billion after a 72 percent decrease a 
month earlier 
the strength in transportation included large gains in the auto 
aircraft and shipbuilding industries 
excluding transportation the december increase in orders for 
durable goods was 16 percent 
in other industries orders for primary metals rose 53 percent 
to 133 billion demand for electrical machinery was up 11 percent 
to 203 billion while orders for nonelectrical machinery dropped 
32 percent to 207 billion most of the decline in the 
nonelectrical category was in engines and turbines 
shipments of durable goods increased 38 percent to 12446 
billion in december following a 12 percent increase in november 
shipments for the year totaled 139 trillion up 99 percent

president bush meanwhile said wednesday he thinks the economy 
is reasonably stable and added theres no signals out there 
in the markets that this economy is in real trouble 
the president said he was concerned however that higher 
interest rates could stifle economic growth 
his remarks came a day after the federal reserve board chairman 
alan greenspan told a congressional panel the central bank is 
likely to keep a tight grip on the money supply to control inflation 
i havent talked to alan lately but i dont want to see us 
move so strongly against the fear of inflation that we impede 
growth bush said 
reporting on the federal budget the treasury department said 
wednesday that the deficit shrank to 116 billion for december 
less than half the level of a year earlier thanks to a shift in the 
payment date for social security checks 
the treasury reported receiving 938 billion in revenues last 
month up 97 percent from the same period a year earlier spending 
meanwhile was down 41 percent from december 1987 to 1054 billion 
the december 1987 deficit had been 244 billion 
also wednesday the federal reserves 12 district banks reported 
stronger economic activity in december and early january fueled by 
strength in retail sales and manufacturing 
the report based on surveys conducted by the banks found little 
change in other sectors of the economy demand for bank loans was 
generally flat construction work was subdued in most parts of the 
country and continuing dry weather threatened the winter wheat crop 
in some areas 
it would appear on the basis of these reports that the 
national economy gained momentum in recent weeks as consumer 
spending strengthened manufacturing activity continued to rise and 
producers scheduled more investment in plant and equipment said 
the report 
and a real estate trade group said sales of existing 
singlefamily homes last year hit their highest level since 1979 as 
buyers shopped in lower price ranges rather than leave the market 
when costs rose 
the national association of realtors said 363 million homes were 
sold in 1988 up 29 percent from 1987 when 353 million homes had 
been sold it was the highest sales volume since 383 million homes 
were sold in 1979

officials of the chicago mercantile exchange have 
promised that there will be no sacred cows when they review 
their rules in response to a federal investigation of suspected 
fraud in the financial futures market 
weve got to change the rules so even the few cant do 
anything dishonest with a public order said leo melamed chief 
counsel at the merc and one of its most powerful figures 
the exchange announced wednesday it was forming a 10member panel 
to review trading procedures in the wake of the fbi undercover 
investigation known as operation sourmash 
the announcement came as a grand jury convened to hear 
prosecutors present evidence in the case which involves floor 
dealings at the chicago board of trade and the merc the worlds 
largestvolume futures exchanges 
although trading activity reflected a businessasusual 
atmosphere at both exchanges traders admitted to some nervousness 
people say buy the rumor sell the news said a currency 
trader at the merc who declined to be identified nobody feels 
like they can differentiate between the two any more 
the chicago tribune citing unidentified sources reported today 
that the fbi has kept two undercover agents on the trading floors of 
the exchanges in a highly unusual move to record traders reacting to 
waves of subpoenas 
the agents have been posing as clerks or messengers to document 
statements as traders swap tales of earlier encounters with the fbi 
or discuss how to respond to hundreds of subpoenas issused since the 
scandal broke last week the tribune said 
sources told the newspaper that prosecutors are interested in 
getting evidence of obstruction of justice 
the chicago suntimes reported today that part of the 
investigation has focused on money laundering through the exchanges 
citing federal sources it did not name the newspaper said an fbi 
agent posing as a trader told a real trader he had a very 
sizeable amount of cash he could not report to the goverment and 
asked for records showing the money came from trading profits the 
trader agreed the newspaper said 
during the investigation which became public a week ago today 
fbi undercover agents posed as traders and published reports said 
other traders agreed to wear recording devices after confronted by 
authorities with evidence of wrongdoing 
the tribune today said operation sourmash was planned as early as 
1984 
although federal marshals sealed off the 16th floor of the 
downtown everett dirksen federal building which in the past has 
been used for grand jury testimony us attorney anton valukas in 
keeping with office policy declined even to confirm that an 
investigation was under way 
but the mercs announcement of the creation of the special panel 
said improvements in practices and procedures may be necessary in 
the wake of revelations of a federal investigation 
it matters not whether this federal investigation involves 
one member or many members of the exchanges said melamed 
what matters is that we use this opportunity to act responsibly 
and make improvements where they are necessary he added there 
will be no sacred cows 
the panel is made up of five industry officials and five former 
or current public officials among them former sen thomas eagleton 
dmissouri 
the justice department has no quarrel with me melamed said 
while we dont know what they were doing that doesnt mean we are 
on the opposite side of the intent were going to use this 
opportunity here is an environment in which we can make this a 
model exchange

michael boskin chosen by president bush to be 
his chief economic adviser said today the administration intends to 
pursue policies that would keep the economy expanding but cautioned 
against looking for a single magic cure that would make continued 
growth possible 
boskin testifying at his confirmation hearing before the senate 
banking committee said he planned to advise bush on such topics as 
the budget deficit inflation employment and income growth 
it will be our task to provide the soundest possible advice to 
president bush and other administration officials said boskin 
43 a highly regarded economics professor from stanford university 
one of the greatest challenges facing us today is the 
continuation of what has been the longtime peacetime expansion in 
postwar history boskin said in opening remarks to the committee 
though no single policy can guarantee the continued growth and 
stability of our economy the administration is committed to a set 
of basic principles aimed at achieving this goal 
boskin a top campaign adviser to bush on economic issues was 
expected to have little trouble winning senate confirmation 
during the campaign boskin developed the flexible freeze 
which became bushs allpurpose answer to queries on how he planned 
to increase spending for a variety of domestic programs while still 
lowering the budget deficit without an increase in taxes 
under the flexible freeze the overall growth in federal spending 
would be restrained to the level of inflation any programs allowed 
to grow at a faster pace than inflation would require cuts in 
spending in other areas 
while bush listed a variety of programs in which he intended to 
boost spending he never specified exactly which programs would face 
cuts 
as head of the threemember council of economic advisers boskin 
is expected to play a key role along with darman chosen as bushs 
budget director in formulating tax and spending policies for the 
new administration 
boskin is generally viewed as a mainstream conservative economist 
who at times was critical of reagan administration policies 
in a book published before he joined the bush campaign boskin 
gave a mixed review to reagan administration policies 
while praising reagans efforts to reduce regulation cut taxes 
and hold down inflation he said reagan was partly to blame for 
the large deficits due to the defense buildup and his original tax 
cut 
boskin has been a longtime proponent of farreaching changes in 
social security and other middleclass benefit programs calling 
them welfare for the wealthy 
in his book reagan and the economy boskin said reagans 
successor could control government spending only by a major attack 
on middleclass entitlements 
he said social security the medicare program that pays the 
medical bills of the elderly and farm subsidies were all prime 
targets for cuts 
the case for reduced spending remains strong in a program such 
as social security which pays welloff elderly people many billions 
of dollars more than what they and their employers paid in plus 
interest he wrote 
however bushs flexible freeze specifically exempted social 
security from any limits on its growth each year and bush took no 
position on cutting middleclass benefit programs during his 
campaign

american telephone amp telegraph co today reported the first 
annual loss in its 104year history reflecting a previously 
announced charge for modernization that reduced net income by 396 
billion 
the results which atampt had projected last month resulted from a 
672 billion pretax charge in the fourth quarter that covers the 
cost of scrapping outdated equipment and moving retiring or laying 
off 16000 employees 
atampts stock was rock solid after the announcement unchanged at 
3087 at midmorning in consolidated new york stock exchange 
trading 
you say my gosh what a huge charge but when its atampt and 
its such a large company people just brush it off and look ahead 
to the next quarter most companies it would just wipe them right 
out said audrey stevoff an analyst at duff amp phelps inc in 
chicago 
atampt has previously said the charge would have no effect on its 
cash flow its ability to pay dividends or the money available for 
investment revenue in the fourth quarter and the full year set 
records for the period since the 1984 breakup of the bell system 
atampt said it had a net loss of 334 billion for the three months 
ended dec 31 compared with profits of 498 million or 46 cents a 
share a year earlier revenue rose to 921 billion from 865 
billion a year earlier 
for all of 1988 atampt said it lost 167 billion compared to a 
profit of 204 billion or 188 a share a year earlier revenue 
rose to 352 billion from 338 billion 
nynex corp one of the companies spun off from atampt in the 1984 
breakup separately reported a 61 percent rise in its 
fourthquarter profit 
the charge that resulted in atampts historic annual loss came from 
speeding up its program of getting rid of old phone equipment and 
putting in new digital switches and other equipment that uses the 
language of computers 
atampt said the changes would put the company in a better position 
to lower longdistance prices and meet the competition atampt is in a 
fierce battle for customers especially big businesses with mci 
communications corp and us sprint communications co 
the charge for network modernization despite its effect on 
shortterm results was driven by our determination to continue 
winning customers in the marketplace said robert e allen atampt 
chairman underlying this action are clear indications that 1988 
was a year of steady improvement in our operations 
new yorkbased nynex said its earnings in the quarter ended dec 
31 rose to 3422 million or 174 a share from 3225 million or 
159 a share a year earlier revenue rose to 324 billion from 
310 billion 
for all of 1988 nynex said its earnings rose to 132 billion 
or 663 a share from 128 billion or 626 a share a year 
earlier revenue rose to 127 billion from 121 billion in 1987

an american trade group has proposed buying the 
uncompleted us embassy building in moscow on which construction 
stopped after bugging devices were found in the structure a 
newspaper reported thursday 
the journal of commerce said dwayne andreas chairman of the 
major commodities company archer daniels midland co has proposed 
buying the building to use as headquarters for a us trade group of 
seven companies 
the proposal has been discussed by us and soviet officials but 
no decision has been made the newspaper said quoting a us state 
department official in washington 
if the decision was made today to go ahead and make the new 
embassy building available to the business community it would take 
two years and run roughly 55 million said the official joseph 
hulings special coordinator for the soviet union and eastern europe 
the embassy originally was set for completion in 1983 work was 
halted in 1985 after the building was found to be riddled with 
sophisticated listening devices 
sale of the embassy is expected to be one option the bush 
administration will consider when it decides the fate of the 
eightstory building on devyatinsky street in downtown moscow 
hulings said 
selling it to american businesses could help raise funds for 
building a new embassy and remove this as a sticking point in 
dealing with congress and the soviets and tend to bring the business 
community closer to the embassy community in moscow according to 
hulings 
former president reagan in october said the building should be 
torn down and rebuilt 
in early december adms andreas spoke with former deputy 
secretary of state john c whitehead to discuss interest among the 
members of the american trade consortium hulings said 
its been raised with the soviets with a look at this as a 
possible option the newspaper quoted hulings as saying 
if the united states decided to sell the building they would 
need permission from the soviet union to locate the embassy 
elsewhere 
no one was available at adms decatur ill headquarters to 
comment on the article a secretary in the corporate spokesmans 
office said 
besides adm the trade group includes chevron corp eastman 
kodak co ford motor co johnson amp johnson rjr nabisco and

gene king used to set lines in the ouachita 
river or the bouef for catfish now he uses a tractor to haul the 
slimy whiskered bottomfeeders from 42 acres of ponds that have 
replaced his bean fields and pasture 
my father was a farmer i grew up helping him grow cotton and 
cattle and cattle are still my first love but as far as 
profitability on the land goes its catfish that makes sense he 
said 
king 43 is one of a growing number of louisiana farmers who are 
turning to catfish growing to keep their heads above water 
financially 
no longer considered a poor mans food catfish are getting a 
reputation nationwide as swank cuisine in urban food stores and chic 
restaurants that have seized on the exotic cajun fare of louisiana 
gary jensen an associate aquaculture specialist at louisiana 
state university found a responsive audience in new orleans at a 
recent seminar on catfish farming 
theres no doubt that the traditional row crops are suffering 
because of low prices farmers are looking for other cash crops and 
catfish has been very profitable jensen said 
louisiana which ranks fourth in catfish production nationally 
behind mississippi alabama and arkansas had about 1000 acres of 
catfish ponds in 1984 jensen said in 1988 9000 acres of ponds 
were under cultivation 
catfish farming has sure boomed around here said albert 
cobb the manager of louisiana catfish inc the wisner la 
processing plant has been in operation for 13 months 
we like to think of ourselves as the catfish capital of the 
world we still have a way to go but were working on it he said 
catfish growers built the plant because of the need for 
additional processing facilities cobb said in its first full year 
of operation he said it processed 5 million pounds of fish 
catfish is big business around here wisner has a population of 
2500 people and we employ 84 of them whats more we have plans in 
the near future to add another 50 so you can see the kind of impact 
were talking about cobb said 
switching to catfish can be expensive king puts the costs at 
between 2000 and 2500 an acre just to build the ponds construct 
the pumping and water systems and fill the ponds the fish are 
additional 
its a big initial investment because to raise catfish you have 
to have good equipment the whole name of the game is to raise live 
fish so you need good aeration and good feeding equipment king 
said 
once the operation is producing fish however king said farmers 
find they have more money per acre come harvest 
overall id say your gross yield per acre with catfish is about 
2600 compared to 600 for soybeans and 300 in cattle the net 
yield would be between 600 and 800 an acre for catfish it would 
be about 250 on soybeans and 200 on cattle he said 
king said the market for catfish is growing rapidly as well 
ensuring years of demand ahead 
its not a blue collar fish anymore the chefs have really 
helped the catfish image theyve taken it out of the country and 
put it in the cities and thats where the markets are us country 
folks have always known how good catfish are city folks are just 
learning it he said 
one thing hasnt changed king said he still likes his catfish 
cooked the same way he did when his mother used to prepare those he 
hauled in on trotline 
little salt a little pepper dip them in cornmeal and fry them 
in hot grease boy there aint nothing better than that he said

all over america bankers and their depositors are taking 
potshots at what looks to them like a bush administration tax that 
fails the administrations own duck test to them it looks like 
a duck it quacks like a duck and its a tax in ducks feathers 
in question is a proposal offered by treasury secretary nicholas 
brady and defended as one option by president bush to impose a 
fee of 25 cents on every 100 deposited into a federallyinsured 
savings and loan institution bank or credit union 
the revenue raised would help bail out the governments sampl 
insurance fund 
i think it is a terrible idea gerald martel president of 
first federal savings and loan of lewiston maine said wednesday 
when the idea first flew 
i dont have a clear answer on how you solve this problem in an 
equitable manner martel said but i dont think applying a tax 
is an answer 
not a tax said bush gamely i will answer the question with a 
question is it a tax when the person pays the fee to go to 
yosemite park using the park 
john sununu his chief of staff tried calling it an adjustment 
upward of the current premium structure 
sununu added that it does not pass the duck test and therefore 
is not a tax 
the duck analogy arose on every lip in washington because 
only a week ago richard darman bushs nominee to be budget 
director told senators the president remains opposed to any new 
taxes and wont try to fool people by playing on words i think 
the burden of that is the duck test if it looks like a duck its 
a duck darman said 
marlin fitzwater bushs press spokesmen contending the proposal 
was not a tax challenged reporters to ask the first 10 people who 
walked by a downtown washington corner if they thought the proposal 
is a tax theyll probably say no he said 
the washington post took him up on it and reported today that 
seven of the first 10 people on the corner said it was a tax one 
said it wasnt and two were unsure 
fitzwater insisted the idea was not a duck what youre looking 
at today is a trial balloon he said 
a little later fitzwater took that back circulating through the 
white house press room saying it was not an intentional trial 
balloon 
whatever out in america it laid an egg 
what i see is a constituency of 240 million people calling 
their congressmen about it said william a ferguson chief 
operating officer at french market homestead federal savings 
association in new orleans 
i dont think it would be popular ferguson said whether 
its right or wrong whether its the best alternative or not i 
dont think this will gather the popular support to be implemented 
i would mind a lot said amy davis of little rock ark im 
the kind of person who has a little bit set back in savings nothing 
to brag about and i dont think its right i should pay for their 
problems 
i cant believe they really think this is a solution to the 
problem said norman m coulson president of glenfed inc in 
glendale calif parent of one of the nations top five sampls one 
of the problems in our country is our savings rates are not as high 
as they should be and this is just another impediment 
he made a point familiar to washington where the publics low 
rate of savings is often deplored americans saved only 32 cents of 
every disposable dollar in 1987 the lowest rate in 40 years 
whats the difference between charging them on their income tax 
and doing this coulson asked referring to opposition in some 
quarters to using taxpayers money to bail out insolvent sampls 
the depositors look at how much interest they are going to 
earn on their dollars and if you have an additional assessment to 
them theyre just going to withdraw it and the cost will be borne by 
the institution coulson said the consumer would have the 
opportunity to go to a noninsured institution 
i dont think it should always come from the little man per 
se said depositor terryann rutherford at french market homestead 
its hard to always say the government ought to pay its hard to 
say the little man ought to pay rutherford said 
but it just seems like someone is always coming by the little 
man and saying thank you

house opponents of a 50 percent congressional 
pay raise said today they cant stop the increase despite growing 
senate opposition to the higher salary 
rep thomas j tauke riowa a leading opponent of the raise 
said hes now focusing on a longrange strategy that would roll back 
the increase and change the system that permits it to become law 
without a vote 
and rep robert c smith rnh who has organized a house 
letterwriting drive to speaker jim wright demanding a vote said 
we cannot budge the speaker 
in the senate opposition continued to grow wednesday after 
legislation was filed to block the increase 
opposition was turned up a notch outside congress too as three 
parttime musicians from the detroit area released an antiraise 
protest song tea bag revolution the title with its reference 
to the boston tea party comes from efforts of 30 radio talk show 
hosts who are behind a national drive to send tea bags to lawmakers 
with the message read my tea bag no fifty percent raise for 
congress 
legislation that would reject the pay raise and roll it back 
should it take effect was introduced wednesday in the senate the 
legislation had a dozen sponsors in the morning and 23 by days end 
nearly a quarter of the 100member senate 
the proposed pay raise for members of congress judges and top 
executive branch officials would become law automatically feb 8 
unless each chamber rejects it rankandfile lawmakers would see 
their pay go from 89500 to 135000 
opponents of the raise were grasping at anything that could give 
them momentum wednesday 
when house minority whip dick cheney rwyo sent out a letter 
that no votes were scheduled through feb 8 house payraise 
opponents scheduled a news conference for today to urge a vote 
pete williams a spokesman for cheney said the schedule was for 
planning purposes and never intended to have any significance for 
the pay raise 
sen charles e grassley riowa a cosponsor of the legislation 
to roll back the pay raise remembered that president bush said he 
would have something to say about the raise after he was 
inaugurated 
grassley wrote bush on wednesday you must choose between 
aligning yourself with speaker jim wright and a dozen in the house 
leadership who favor the raiseand the 85 percent of the american 
people who oppose the issue 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters we are 
watching congressional action at the moment 
house majority whip tony coelho dcalif said tuesday the house 
democratic leadership does not plan to schedule a vote before the 
deadline 
mark johnson a spokesman for wright dtexas said the speaker 
has not given indications a vote would be scheduled to stop the 
raise 
senate majority leader george j mitchell dmaine has promised 
a senate vote on rejecting the raise before the deadline 
but he told reporters wednesday i favor a comprehensive

time inc on thursday reported a 12 percent earnings increase in 
the fourth quarter of 1988 but dow jones amp co said a yearlong 
financial advertising slump was to blame for a 145 percent drop in 
profits in the period 
ah belo corp owner of the dallas morning news and broadcast 
properties said earnings fell about 51 percent in the quarter 
partly because of an asset writedown 
time based in new york reported earnings of 58 million or 
101 a share on revenue of 121 billion that was up from 52 
million or 88 cents a share on revenue of 113 billion in the

to reduce the value on its books of a satellite 50 percent owned by 
home box office inc a time subsidiary 
operating profits from times magazines were 87 million up from 
81 million a year earlier while cable television profits increased

billion in 1987

ah belo said earnings for the fourth quarter were 25 million

toyota motor corp will soon announce plans for a 
12 billion european car plant to position itself for the 
unification of the common market in 1992 according to sources and a 
published report thursday 
sources said the move is pending a response from a partner 
believed to be a car manufacturer in a european country 
toyota officials confirmed that the japanese company has narrowed 
the list of possible sites and partners for european passenger car 
production 
the plans under study reportedly include establishment of either 
an independent manufacturing operation or a joint venture in 
britain spain portugal belgium west germany or france 
the plan is believed to involve a 12 billion investment that 
eventually could create more than 1000 jobs the financial times of 
london reported thursday the newspaper said an announcement on the 
project is expected by midfebruary 
toyota japans biggest automaker is aiming to have an assembly 
base in western europe before the creation of the eecs single 
community market in 1992 the newspaper said 
the single market is intended to establish a free flow of goods 
in the 12nation trade bloc through harmonization of tax laws and 
other measures many imports from japan and other countries are 
expected to be subject to restrictions 
in addition the move would allow toyota to dodge japanese 
government restrictions on auto exports to the eec toyota has 
lagged far begind nissan motor co and honda motor co in europe 
toyota executive vice president tsutomu ohshima said recently 
with continuing japanese government restrictions necessitated to 
ease trade tension with the ec we are not in a situation where we 
can keep scaling up our exports 
we have no choice but to go to europe to supply cars as an ec 
insider he said adding that toyota wants to produce cars with a 
european partner to smooth entry into the highly protectionist 
market 
japans ministry of international trade and industry has limited 
increases in japanese car and commercial vehicle exports to europe 
since mid1986 
last year toyota shipped 291084 cars and commercial vehicles to 
the eec up 35 percent from 1987 nissans europebound exports 
edged up 06 percent to 322633 vehicles in the same year 
passenger car production would follow toyotas joint project in 
west germany with volkswagen ag which began manufacturing 
toyotadesigned taro pickup trucks at volkswagens hanover plant at 
the beginning of the year

campbell soup co was deceptive in advertising 
its soups as good for the heart without disclosing their high sodium 
content the federal trade commission charged today 
the company said it stands behind the ads in question which are 
no longer running and will contest the commissions charge 
the ftc complaint said campbell did not have substantiation for 
its claim that most of its soups make a positive contribution to a 
diet that reduces the risk of heart disease 
the commission is seeking an order from an administrative law 
judge that would forbid campbell from asserting that soups 
containing more than 500 milligrams of sodium per eightounce 
serving are good for the heart without also stating the sodium 
content of the soup 
campbell makes 70 different kinds of condensed soup plus two 
different lowsodium lines the commission staff declined to discuss 
what it knows about the sodium content of all the regular varieties 
but an inspection of six at a supermarket showed sodium levels 
ranging from 710 milligrams for turkey vegetable to 910 milligrams 
for chicken noodle 
sodium is part of sodium chloride ordinary table salt which 
manufacturers add to food to enhance taste a teaspoon of salt 
contains about 2000 milligrams or two grams of sodium 
a committee of the national academy of sciences has recommended 
that most americans limit their sodium intake to 1100 to 3300 
milligrams per day though 200 milligrams is considered adequate 
most americans get 4000 to 6000 milligrams a day 
the commission objected to a magazine ad which said the companys 
soups were high in fiber low in fat and cholesterol and high in 
calcium when made with milk 
chicken noodle it said is low in fat and has just 15 
milligrams of cholesterol and thats especially good to know 
because research tells us that a diet low in fat and cholesterol may 
help reduce the risk of some forms of heart disease 
we are always supportive of health information in ads said 
william macleod director of the commissions bureau of consumer 
protection 
but health claims if made must not be directly undermined by 
undisclosed facts he said 
if they dont advertise the hearthealthiness of the soup this 
proposed order wouldnt come into play he said 
many experts contend that excess sodium leads to high blood 
pressure which is known to increase the risk of heart disease and 
heart attack but some dissenters argue that studies show some 
people tolerate a wide range of sodium in the diet without change in 
blood pressure while for unknown reasons other people are salt 
sensitive with pressure rising sharply once a threshold of sodium 
concentration is passed 
macleod acknowledged the scientific dispute and said the 
commission would rely heavily on last years report on nutrition 
and health issued by the surgeon general which said diets high in 
sodium clearly contribute to high blood pressure 
in camden nj campbell spokesman david hackney said we 
stand behind our advertising and we dont think its misleading 
since the sodium content is disclosed on every can 
the twopage magazine ad in question has not run since march 
1988 hackney said the companys decision to drop it had nothing to 
do with the commissions investigation

futures prices for wheat and soybeans advanced but 
corn was mixed at the close thursday on the chicago board of trade 
soybeans bounced back in early trading from wednesdays losses of 
up to 18 cents then they lost ground but finally rallied before 
the final bell to finish up 15 cents for march spot contract 
after the market failed yesterday traders were very jittery 
said mickey luth soybeans analyst for shearson lehman hutton inc 
confirmation of us soymeal sales to the soviet union supported 
soybean futures but weighing on prices were continued expectations 
of a good crop from south america said luth 
wheat and corn prices were boosted by the agriculture department 
strengthening the possibility of more sales of those two commodities 
to the soviet union said jerry gidel of gh miller 
at the close wheat was 2 cents to 4 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in march at 444 a bushel corn was 1 cents 
lower to 2 cents higher with march at 272 a bushel oats were 
2 cents to 3 cent lower with march at 224 a bushel and

american telephone amp telegraph co on thursday 
reported the first annual loss in its 104year history the result 
of a huge writeoff to streamline for longdistance phone wars 
the historic loss was no surprise to shareholders atampt forecast 
it last month but it nevertheless signaled the growing urgency of 
competition in the longdistance phone business 
atampt took a 672 billion pretax charge in the fourth quarter of 
1988 to cover costs of accelerating its transition to digital 
technology which uses the language of computers to send voices and 
data over fiberoptic lines 
the company is scrapping outdated analog phone equipment and 
moving retiring or laying off 16000 employees 
atampts stock was unchanged at 3087 in late afternoon trading 
on the new york stock exchange thursday reflecting investors 
unconcern the writeoff has no effect on atampts cash flow ability 
to pay dividends or money available for investment 
atampt lost 334 billion in the quarter ended dec 31 and 167 
billion in all of 1988 
you say my gosh what a huge charge but when its atampt and 
its such a large company people just brush it off and look ahead 
to the next quarter said audrey stevoff an analyst at duff amp 
phelps inc in chicago 
atampt was forced to speed up its introduction of digital services 
to meet the competition from mci communications corp and us sprint 
communications co which have been steadily taking away its 
customers 
the fight is most ferocious for fortune 100 accounts the giants 
such as general electric co ford motor co and du pont co that 
have phone bills of millions of dollars a month 
atampt the only longdistance company with regulated rates 
complains that federal regulation is preventing it from responding 
flexibly to special offers by unregulated mci and us sprint 
im getting my clock cleaned joseph p nacchio an atampt vice 
president who appears in commercials complained to reporters this 
month in washington according to a trade publication report on 
atampt im losing customers faster than i can count them right 
now 
responding to the threat atampt is pushing hard for regulatory 
reform in washington and has redeployed thousands of people into 
sales jobs meanwhile its moneylosing computer business got a big 
boost from a 1 billion air force contract last year 
executives of ge ford and du pont all major customers of atampt 
said in interviews thursday that they consider themselves big 
winners from the cutthroat battle for their business 
with new services higher quality and lower prices corporate 
america has really benefited by what really is almost entirely due 
to competition said stan welland ges manager of corporate 
telecommunications 
du pont uses highvolume data pipes to carry traffic between 
a research center in victoria texas and a supercomputer at its 
wilmington del headquarters 
ford keeps in touch with dealerships via phone links to computer 
terminals in the dealers finance and service areas 
telecommunications is an area that 10 years ago was somewhat of 
a backwater atampt took care of that for you todays its an 
essential part of the technical infrastructure said si gilman 
fords executive director of information systems 
most residential customers and small businesses also are 
benefiting from the competition but not as much they dont use new 
services such as video conferencing also higher local charges 
offset the drop in longdistance rates for people who dont make 
many longdistance calls 
atampt pointed out that in spite of its loss from the onetime 
charge its revenue in the fourth quarter and full year were the 
highest since the bell system breakup five years ago 
without the charge earnings would have risen 19 percent in the 
quarter and 11 percent for the full year 
the charge for network modernization despite its effect on 
shortterm results was driven by our determination to continue 
winning customers in the marketplace atampt chairman robert e 
allen said in a statement underlying this action are clear 
indications that 1988 was a year of steady improvement in our 
operations 
atampts 334 billion fourthquarter net loss compared with 
profits of 498 million or 46 cents a share a year earlier 
revenue rose to 921 billion from 865 billion a year earlier 
for the full year the 167 billion loss compared to a profit of 
204 billion or 188 a share a year earlier revenue rose to 
352 billion from 338 billion 
atampt faces talks in april with the communication workers of 
america which represents 135000 employees union spokeswoman gaye 
williams mack said thursday the company is cutting hourly workers 
but theyre not cutting the fat out of management 
mci and us sprint are not organized by the union

the united auto workers union born in protest is 
facing its most serious internal conflict in 40 years 
a band of dissidents led by uaw region 5 director jerry tucker 
of st louis is mounting a challenge to the policies of union 
president owen bieber and his followers allied in the 
administration caucus 
the caucus meets friday and saturday in dearborn mich to talk 
about strategies including how to handle tucker and his troops in 
advance of the unions triennial constitutional convention in june 
in anaheim calif 
the opposition is the noisiest since the first decade of the uaw 
which grew out of a 1937 sitdown strike in flint mich 
despite that union insiders and labor analysts dont see a 
threat to biebers presidency tucker himself is not seen as a 
challenger to bieber but his dissident stance is nonetheless 
unsettling to the unions leadership 
i think the administrations concern is that it is unknown 
that it represents something that can tap into concerns on down the 
road said harley shaiken a professor at the university of 
california at san diego who follows labor relations between the 
union and the big three automakers 
since bieber became the unions commanderinchief in 1983 the 
uaw has signed agreements calling for more worker participation in 
management and increased job security in return for a blurring of 
the traditional job classification lines 
that has been the source of tuckers discontent 
somethings wrong when general motors corp can speed up 
the line in violation of contracts and union representatives say 
we just have to let that happen tucker said in september 
parts of the new directions message of tucker and his 
supporters isnt new to the uaw tucker said the union needs to turn 
to its roots and take a more militant stand against the automakers 
it is certainly more militant in a traditional sense than what 
the union has done shaiken said it also seeks a different way 
to address the core issues that the union faces job security and 
the role of the union in a global auto market 
its not simply the 30s or the 40s recycled for the 80s 
shaiken added i think there is more substance to it 
but a uaw source speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
challenge to the administration this year is similar to past union 
election years 
the part of chicken little will be played by the challengers 
the source said they have no choice but to say the sky is 
falling in that sense the evidence doesnt support that there is a 
crisis 
in 1984 bieber appointed tucker as assistant director of region 
5 the largest in the uaw with about 80000 members in eight states 
stretching between colorado and louisiana 
two years later tucker fell out of biebers graces when he ran 
against region 5 director ken worley for a seat on the uaws 
22member international executive board which executes union 
policies set by conventions 
bieber fired tucker four days after he declared his candidacy 
saying he violated a union election rule tucker sued bieber and the 
union claiming his rights were violated he lost that challenge in 
a detroit federal court earlier this month 
in the 1986 region 5 election worley won by one of the narrowest 
margins in union history tucker contested the election claiming 
union money was used in worleys campaign and a federally 
supervised election was ordered by the national labor relations 
board 
in that vote last september tucker defeated worley and was 
elected to the executive board it was a major setback for bieber 
i have no problem with dissent but with one exception you 
have to operate by the rules you dont operate by tearing down the 
union bieber said then 
tucker since has made dozens of appearances around the country 
and some union members have been hooking onto his new directions 
train but its tough to gauge tuckers support or a lack of 
support for bieber 
the dissident slate of candidates for uaw offices is unclear it 
is presumed bieber will seek his third threeyear term 
the key question is will jerry tucker basically hit a 
responsive chord among large number of union members or leaders 
shaiken asked that is an open question and thats what makes the 
administration caucus quite nervous

drexel burnham lambert incs senior 
junkbond trader michael milken about to be jettisoned by the firm 
he parlayed into a financial superpower appears ready to fight a 
criminal prosecution that menaces his carefully built reputation as 
business genius and philanthropist 
milkens associates said thursday it was unlikely he would strike 
a plea bargain with the federal prosecutors in new york who 
extracted a record 650 million settlement from drexel in the 
biggest securities fraud case in history 
court papers revealed wednesday that terms of the settlement 
require it to fire milken and withhold the 1988 compensation due 
him estimated at 200 million his lawyers said the terms amount to 
an outrageous disgraceful and illegal punishment which they 
indicated would be challenged in court 
for the 42yearold capitalism evangelist racketeering and fraud 
charges expected to be filed within days represent far more than 
loss of a job indeed with a personal wealth estimated by forbes 
magazine at 800 million and an undisputed knack for making money 
he can survive the loss financially 
but the criminal and related civil cases against him and drexel 
have for two years cast a highly publicized cloud over a remarkable 
career that revolves around his virtually singlehanded creation of 
the market in highyield highrisk junk bonds 
they also have brought attention and sympathy from the many who 
know milken as a devoted family man attentive friend and donor of 
millions of dollars to charity 
their portrayal stands in sharp contrast to the portrayal of 
milken by government investigators as a scheming manipulative 
arrogant and greedy trader who colluded with nowimprisoned inside 
trader ivan boesky to violate a range of securities laws 
milken hasnt talked publicly about whether hell fight the feds 
but he has consistently denied any wrongdoing his lawyers friends 
and associates expect he wont change his mind despite what they 
call unprecedented pressure on him by us prosecutors 
my sense of things is this is a man who thinks he has done 
nothing to blacken his familys name and thats important to him 
hes very resolute said jesse kornbluth a vanity fair writer who 
spent many hours with milken over the summer while preparing an 
article and still chats with him frequently on the telephone 
i expect him to fight it echoed clark johnson president and 
chief executive officer of pier 1 imports which has financed 
expansion with the help of milken and drexel 
drexel is expected to survive the loss of milken though it was 
he and his junk bond traders who transformed the firm from an 
insignificant brokerage house to a powerful force on wall street 
milken once the prime mover in the junk bond market is no longer 
indispensable analysts said 
if this had occurred a couple of years ago it might have been 
a real big problem with drexel but the junk bond market is pretty 
well established and they are pretty well established in the 
market said larry eckenfelder who follows the securities 
business for prudential bache securities inc in san francisco 
milken is widely credited with singlehandedly persuading 
investors that there was gold in junk the highyield highrisk 
bonds issued by companies too small or too weak to earn the 
endorsement of bondrating firms 
he preached the idea that a junk bond investor could earn high 
interest and protect himself from the potential default of one 
company by holding a portfolio of bonds in a number of companies 
with success has come incredible largess milken and his brother 
and business associate lowell through three family trusts have 
given more than 17 million to 200 charities in the last six years 
some of the recipients say milken gives of himself as generously 
as he does of his money 
barbara firestone who runs a los angelesarea organization for 
children who are retarded or have emotional problems said milken 
often visits the children the trader who has given more than 
850000 to the group called help knows many of the children by 
name and exhorts them to fulfill their potential 
as recently as two weeks ago he called from new york where he 
apparently was working on his legal defense to get advice on the 
proper present for a teenage girl who had invited him to a ceremony 
marking her graduation from one of helps programs 
asked if the milken she knows could be capable of fraud ms 
firestone said 
i dont know all i know is that i see a man whos gentle 
unassuming unpretentious very caring very committed its not the 
man you see in the newspaper

federal tax law changes helped cause a 23 percent 
drop in sales of public partnerships last year an industry group 
reported thursday 
investors poured 105 billion into taxsaving limited 
partnerships last year compared with a record 135 billion in 
1987 the investment partnership association said 
in a limited partnership the liability of the limited partners 
in the business is limited to their capital contribution 
furthermore partners share all earnings before taxes whereas the 
owners of public corporations shareholders receive only a 
percentage of aftertax earnings as dividends 
the most dramatic decline in sales last year 731 percent 
came in of master limited partnerships which are traded publicly 
sales of mlps plunged to 771 million from 287 billion the 
previous year 
fuhrman nettles vice president of robert a stanger amp co a 
leading investment partnership research firm attributed the slump 
in mlp sales to federal tax law changes that took effect at the end 
of 1987 
under the revisions new master limited partnerships are taxed as 
corporations unless they are engaged in energy natural resources or 
real estate before the change only 25 percent of all mlps met the 
exemptions 
mlps are way down because of the tax law changes nettles 
said generally its made them moderately unattractive 
the investment partnership association said sales of real estate 
partnerships were off 236 percent in 1987 equipment leasing was up 
11 percent cable television was down 35 percent and oil and gas 
down 558 percent 
overall sales in limited partnerships for 1989 are projected to 
decline slightly to 102 billion nettles said 
he projected that sales in oil and gas partnerships would 
increase to 125 million from 89 million but that income from them 
would be halved to 250 million 
equipment leasing and cable television partnerships would 
increase slightly he said while commodities partnerships were 
unsure because of investigations into alleged corrupt trading in two 
chicago exchanges 
despite the 1988 decline nettles defended investments in limited 
partnerships as currently less risky than the stock market he also 
said limited partnerships remain a good way for companies to raise 
equity in an economy heavily financed through debt 
its been relatively stable compared with new issues of stocks 
which have been up and down nettles said

the two broadest measures of the nations money 
supply rose in the week ended jan 16 the federal reserve board 
reported thursday 
the fed said the measure known as m2 rose to a seasonally 
adjusted 3070 billion from 30641 billion the previous week 
an even broader measure m3 increased to a seasonally adjusted 
39139 billion from 39046 billion 
the narrowest measure of the money supply m1 fell to a 
seasonally adjusted 7838 billion from 7863 billion 
m1 includes cash in circulation deposits in checking accounts 
and nonbank travelers checks m2 is m1 plus accounts like savings 
deposits and moneymarket mutual funds m3 is m2 plus lessliquid 
accounts such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations 
of 100000 
in judging its monetary policy the fed has indicated it is 
monitoring the value of the dollar commodity prices and the 
difference between short and longterm interest rates it also has 
shifted its attention from m1 to the two broader money supply 
measures 
the fed said in mid 1988 that it reaffirmed its target for annual 
growth in m2 and m3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent which is 
slightly lower than the 1987 target of 55 percent to 85 percent 
the fed has not set a specific target range for m1 since early 1987

the investment giant painewebber group inc said 
thursday its profit plunged 93 percent in the fourth quarter and 
fell 41 percent for all of 1988 reflecting a slowdown in the 
financial market and onetime costs 
donald b marron chairman and chief executive said sharp 
declines in retail and institutional volume in the wake of the 
october 1987 crash more than offset improvement in merchant banking 
and asset mangement activities 
he said the firm took steps to improve productivity by cutting 
support staff consolidating offices and shrinking marginal 
businesses and said it would continue to rigorously pursue that 
program 
painewebber said its profit fell to 512000 in the three months 
ended dec 31 compared with 70 million or 16 cents a share a 
year earlier 
payment of preferred stock dividends left the company with a loss 
of 20 cents per share in the latest quarter 
fourthquarter revenue rose 287 percent to 696 million from 
541 million a year earlier 
the latest results included nonrecurring expenses of 13 
million including 8 million from a previouslydisclosed legal 
settlement involving washington public power supply system 
securities and 5 million related to the relocation of the firms 
systems and operations functions to new jersey 
for the year painewebber earned 424 million or 58 cents per 
share compared with 72 million or 217 per share in 1987 
revenue for the year edged up to 251 billion from 244 billion 
in 1987 
the fullyear results reflected 20 million in costs due to the 
backoffice relocation and 20 million due to the wppss settlement

congress should consider rolling back increases 
in the social security tax because the money is being used to hide 
the true extent of the federal budget deficit the general 
accounting office said thursday 
a surplus in the social security trust fund can lead to 
increased national savings and help the economy deal with huge 
increases in retired persons after the turn of the century but it 
can only do so if the rest of the budget is more or less in 
balance said lawrence h thompson assistant comptroller general 
at a press conference 
social security taxes have been sharply increased under 1983 
legislation aimed at making the system financially sound when the 
baby boom generation retires early in the next century the plan 
called for building up large trust fund surpluses that could be 
tapped later 
however the grammrudman deficitreduction law counts the social 
security fund surpluses in its balance sheet allowing officials to 
claim the budget deficit is being reduced even though social 
security is technically offbudget 
in our judgment the changes to social security enacted in 1983 
are not producing the result of lessening the burden of paying for 
the retirement benefits of the baby boom generation said the 
report by the general accounting office the auditing and 
investigating arm of congress the budgetary reality is that the 
payroll taxes are being used to finance the current operations of 
government and are masking the size of the onbudget deficit it 
said 
sen daniel p moynihan dny who requested the report told 
reporters he had already introduced a bill in the new congress to 
take social security out of the deficit calculations if that were 
not done he would support cutting back the tax as the gao 
suggested he said 
it was never meant to finance government moynihan said 
sen ernest f hollings dsc in a separate news conference 
called for excluding social security trust funds from the deficit 
calculations and renewed his call for a national valueadded tax 
dedicated to reduce red ink 
hollings conceded his proposal similar to a 5 percent national 
sales tax was a radical step and would not stand much chance 
without president bush behind it but he said there was little 
evidence so far that bush was ready to propose any serious 
deficitreduction measures 
its total folly to think you can do this without taxes he 
said 
bush has promised to send his budget proposals to congress in 
midfebruary he plans a speech to congress on feb 9

the world may be heading toward a catastrophic 
computer failure unless more effective measures are taken to combat 
computer viruses a leading us computer security specialist said 
thursday 
professor lance j hoffman of george washington university said 
the virus which affected the pentagons arpanet computer network 
last november could have had very disastrous consequences for our 
society 
it wasnt chernobyl yet it was the three mile island it woke 
a lot of people up hoffman told a delegation of japanese computer 
specialists touring this country to assess the virus problem 
he was alluding to the catastrophic explosion and fire that 
wracked a nuclear power plant in the soviet ukraine in april 1986 
along with the much less severe partial meltdown which occurred at 
the tmi atomic power station near harrisburg pa in march 1979 
hoffman added unfortunately i think the chernobyl may well 
happen we are not out of the woods 
viruses are generally small strings of computer codes that can be 
stealthily inserted into software programs causing a variety of 
problems including destruction of computer data and sudden clogging 
of a computers memory with thousands of copies of the virus 
at the same george washington university meeting a staff member 
from the library of congress disclosed that a virus had been found 
last fall within the massive institutions main catalog computer 
system 
it didnt cause any damage it was identified before it could 
spread or permanently erase any data said glenn mcloughlin a 
computer science specialist with the science policy research 
division of the librarys congressional research service 
he said the virus was found after personnel logging onto 
computers at the library noticed they had substantially less 
computer memory space to work with than they had expected 
the virus apparently got into the library of congress system 
mcloughlin said through a piece of software obtained from the 
university of maryland 
we dont know whether it was a student at maryland or whether 
maryland had gotten it from somebody else that was simply the 
latest point of departure for the software he said 
the sixman japanese delegation attending thursdays briefing was 
winding up a 10day tour of the united states their itinerary also 
included visits to the san francisco area los angeles new york 
city international business machines corp offices in purchase 
ny and lehigh university bethlehem pa 
the groups head tomihisa naito president of sg engineering 
company ltd a tokyobased firm dealing with factory automation 
commented that many people in both the united states and japan still 
do not recognize the importance of protecting computer systems 
information in computers has a lot of power nowadays so people 
should be aware of the possibility that that information can be 
contaminated he said 
edwin b heinlein a computer security consultant from san 
rafael calif who helped arrange the japanese visit said he 
agreed with hoffmans assessment that the chances are very good 
for a disastrous computer virus incident 
you can make all the laws you want but only ethical behavior 
will keep people from doing bad things heinlein said despite 
safeguards now being introduced in many computer systems he said 
theres always going to be a loophole or somebody being able to 
take advantage of things

the parent of united airlines reported thursday that its net 
income dropped sharply in the fourth quarter from a year earlier 
mainly as a result of accounting changes delta air lines blamed 
rising operating expenses for a 4 percent decline in its profit for 
its latest quarter 
chicagobased ual corp said its net income for the three months 
ended dec 31 fell to 2087 million or 97 cents a share from 
2099 million or 368 a share a year earlier 
the company said the pershare comparison isnt meaningful 
because of a substantial reduction in the number of shares 
outstanding due to a selftender offer in the first quarter of 1988 
the average number of shares used to compute pershare earnings 
dropped to 21570 in the fourth quarter from 57100 a year earlier 
fourthquarter revenue rose to 222 billion from 210 billion 
in the yearearlier quarter 
ual said the drop in net income for the quarter was mainly due to 
a downward adjustment to a previously reported gain on the sale of 
the companys nonairline subsidiaries 
ual formerly named allegis corp decided in 1987 to reverse its 
travel conglomerate strategy and focus on its core airline business 
the subsidiaries hilton international co hertz corp and westin 
hotel co were sold to fulfill that goal united airlines is the 
nations largest carrier 
the company said additional costs related to the sales of the 
units led to a reduction of 245 million in the previously reported 
gain of 5485 million 
for 1988 as a whole uals net income tripled to 112 billion 
or 3787 a share from 3351 million or 602 a share in 1987 
again the pershare comparison isnt considered meaningful 
revenue for the year increased 82 percent to 898 billion from 
830 billion the previous year 
our goal is to position united as qualitatively best which 
will enable us to produce the earnings necessary to fund a prudent 
capital spending plan and to provide the security and work 
environment our employees so justly deserve said stephen m wolf 
uals chairman president and chief executive officer 
atlantabased delta said its net income for the second quarter of 
its fiscal year slipped to 851 million or 173 a share from 
883 million or 182 a share in the yearearlier quarter 
delta the nations thirdlargest carrier blamed the decline on 
a 12 percent rise in operating expenses in the quarter ended dec 31 
secondquarter revenue rose 9 percent to 186 billion from 
170 billion a year earlier 
while revenues continued to show good growth at over 9 percent 
for the quarter operating expenses rose 12 percent resulting in 
the lower earnings said thomas j roeck deltas senior vice 
president of finance and chief financial officer 
increases in salaries and related costs maintenance expenses 
and commissions were the primary factors in this increase in 
expenses roeck said 
for the first six months of its fiscal year deltas net income 
increased 26 percent to 1851 million or 376 a share from 
1474 million or 303 a share in the same 1987 period 
sixmonth revenue was up 12 percent to 374 billion from 329
